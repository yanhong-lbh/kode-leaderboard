    "article_text": "Karen Read leaves Norfolk Superior Courthouse at the end of day 23 of her trial in Dedham, Massachusetts, on May 29, 2025. (Richard Beetham for Fox News Digital) Karen Read’s defense teamof heavy-hitting attorneys is ready to begin tearing down the prosecution’s murder case against her after the state rested its case this week. Read is accused of killing her boyfriend, Boston Police Officer John O’Keefe, outside an acquaintance's house party just after midnight on Jan. 29, 2022. The prosecution alleges thatRead struck O’Keefewith her 2021 Lexus SUV in a drunken ragme after an evening of fighting before leaving him to freeze to death in the front yard of 34 Fairview Road. KAREN READ DEFENSE GRILLS CRASH EXPERT OVER $400K PRICE TAG AND EXPERIMENTATION METHODS Karen Read speaks with her defense attorney, Alan Jackson, during her retrial in Norfolk Superior Court, Thursday, May 29, 2025, in Dedham, Mass.(AP Photo/Mark Stockwell, Pool) Special prosecutor Hank Brennan rested the state's case on Thursday, nearly two months after jury selection began. Brennan’s final witness, Aperture crash reconstructionist Dr. Judson Welcher spent three days on the stand providing testimony on his findings supporting the state’s allegations that Read fatally struck O’Keefe with her vehicle. He pointed to his own experimentation using a Lexus taillight and wet paint to illustrate how O’Keefe could have sustained the injuries to his arm, and he said that a \"glancing\" blow from the vehicle could explain why the victim didn't have typical car-strike injuries. \"If you impact the hand with a 1-inch narrow metal bar, that's a lot different than if you have a broad, plastic taillight or rear body panel,\" Welcher said. \"So when you have distributed loads, you can take much more.\" Read’s defense team is set to begin presenting their case on Friday as attorneys Alan Jackson, David Yannetti and Robert Alessi look to sow doubt aroundthe state’s allegations, with Yannetti viewed as the strongest member of Read’s team by experts.

KAREN READ DEFENSE FLOATS THEORY THAT ‘JEALOUS’ BRIAN HIGGINS FOUGHT JOHN O'KEEFE BEFORE DEATH \"And then when I hired David Yannetti, I asked him those questions,\" Read said in the same clip. \"The night of Jan. 29, David, what if I ran his foot over? Or what if I clipped him in the knee and he passed out or went to care for himself and threw up or passed out? And David said, ‘Yeah, then you have some element of culpability.'\" Lu believes the primary goal for the defense team should be to humanize Read in a way that paints her in a favorable light to the jurors while taking aim at an alleged cover-up scheme by the Massachusetts Police Department. FOLLOW THE FOX TRUE CRIME TEAM ON X \"The prosecutor has made her into a self-absorbed caricature,\" Lu told Fox News Digital, adding, \"They must get into the hatred of her by [former investigator] Michael Proctor.\" Proctor is on the witness list, but it remains unclear whether the defense will put him on the stand. Prosecutors did not call him this time around after his testimony in the first trial saw jurors shaking their heads as they heard his inappropriate texts about Read in court. The case ended in a mistrial, and he lost his job days before the second trial kicked off. Read has pleaded not guilty. If convicted, she faces the possibility of life in prison for the most serious charge ofsecond-degree murder.

Elon Musk is finishing his official role in the Trump administration, but ifPresident Trump’slatest Truth Social post is any indication, the billionaire isn’t going far. \"I am having a Press Conference tomorrow at 1:30 P.M.

    "article_text": "Former federal prosecutor Katie Cherkasky discusses the DOJ launching a criminal probe into former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on 'Sunday Night in America.' Anthony Weiner, the disgraced ex-congressman seeking to return to politics as a member of New York's City Council, quipped during an interview that \"women are crazy about me\" despite going to prison and being required to register as a sex offender. \"Oh for sure, for sure, my god, they're crazy about me. Women are crazy about me,\" Weiner said when comedian and podcaster Adam Friedland asked if the power politicians wield makes them more attractive to the opposite sex. Weiner's sexting saga began more than a decade ago after a lewd photo of the married congressman in his underwear was posted to one of Weiner's public social media accounts. That initial photo set off a series of events, including his widely publicizeddeparture from Congress in 2011,additional sexting scandals and an FBI investigation that resulted in Weiner serving 21 months in prison and registering as a sex offender for sending sexually explicit images to a minor. FORMER DEMOCRATIC REP. ANTHONY WEINER, CONVICTED OF ILLICIT CONTACT WITH MINOR, FILES TO RUN FOR NYC COUNCIL New York City Mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner during a news conference at the Gay Men's Health Crisis headquarters July 23, 2013, in New York.(Associated Press) Weiner appeared Wednesday on aYouTube-based showhosted by Friedland, during which the podcaster suggested Weiner's sexting scandal wouldn't even break the \"top 100\" news stories of the year in 2025. Weiner agreed, adding \"it was a relatively slow news period\" at the time. He also said his name was part of the reason it gained so much publicity. \"I’m a guy named Weiner who tweeted out a picture of his d---,\" he said. Friedland pointed to what he suggested was a lack of coverage about accusations against former GOP Florida CongressmanMatt Gaetz,who was accused last year of engaging in sex with a minor. Gaetz has denied the accusations. ANTHONY WEINER SAYS VOTERS DON'T WANT WHAT 'DEMOCRATS ARE SELLING,' TALKS ABOUT COMEBACK AS FIERY CENTRIST Rep. Matt Gaetz was accused of having sex with a minor. He denied the accusations.(Aaron Schwartz/NurPhoto via Getty Images) \"Right, and if his name was Matt Kidf---er then the story would have,\" Weiner said, before Friedland interjected. \"No, that's not true,\" Friedland said. \"Think about it this way. If it was today, it would be a 48-hour news cycle, and it would be forgotten.\" Weiner challenged Friedland's theory, telling him it was not a novel idea to think technology played a role in making his sexting scandal so widely publicized. \"Let's move off of this one, not terribly novel idea that technology played a part,\" Weiner said. Weiner and Friedland continued discussing the sexting scandal, including the potential domino effect it played in relation to James Comey's investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server. During the FBI's investigation of Weiner's alleged sexual crimes against a minor, officials reportedly came across emails that prompted FBI Director Comey toreopen an investigationinto Clinton's use of the email server.

At the teen suspect's home, authorities found nearly 20 sets of car keys, credit cards, and other evidence that linked him to thecar break-ins, Hamill said. Since the teen didn't have a criminal record, the state Department of Juvenile Services characterized the offenses as lower-level crimes and allowed him to be released, Hamill said. \"I would offer well over 100 cases in one night, gives you a pretty good record,\" Hamill said. \"These were not violent crimes, as if that lessens the impact on those 121 victims.\" CAREER CRIMINAL, 31, ARRESTED FOR 35TH TIME — SEE HIS LIST OF OFFENSES Laurel Police Chief Russ Hamill said he has little hope that the teen will be held accountable for the crimes he is accused of due to the \"broken system.\"(Laurel Police Department/Facebook) \"Yes, five hours after we were at his house, he was released back into the community, back into the environment that allowed him to be out roaming the streets in all of these counties, late at night and in the early morning, doing these crimes to begin with,\" he added.

PresidentDonald Trumpwrote a fiery, lengthy post on social media Thursday night in response to the intense legal battle surrounding his proposed tariffs. On Thursday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit allowed Trump’s tariffs to temporarily remain in effect, just one day before the US. Court of International Tradeon Wednesday ruledthat Trump overstepped his authority over tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). On Truth Social, Trump wrote that the U.S. Court of International Trade \"incredibly\" ruled against the \"desperately needed\" tariffs, but the order was stayed by the federal court. \"Where do these initial three Judges come from?

    "title": "Chinese nationals who infiltrated US universities",
    "article_text": "American Majority CEO Ned Ryun discusses the amount of money colleges receive from foreign students on ‘The Ingraham Angle.’ The Trump administration has intensified its scrutiny of Chinese nationals studying at U.S. universities after several instances in recent years of students from the communist country engaging in alleged surreptitious activity while in the United States. The incidents, which have involved allegations of espionage, conspiracy and accusations of misleading federal officials, occurred as a result of Chinese nationals or others with Chinese ties participating in joint education programs between the United Statesand China. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced Wednesday the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security plan to \"aggressively revoke\" student visas of Chinese nationals, \"including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party.\" A Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson blasted the new policy ina statementThursday on X, saying the move was \"fully unjustified\" and damaging to the United States’ reputation. STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS IT WILL ‘AGGRESSIVELY REVOKE’ VISAS OF CHINESE STUDENTS Secretary of State Marco Rubio testifies before a Senate Committee on Foreign Relations hearing to examine the president's proposed budget request for fiscal year 2026 for the Department of State on Capitol Hill in Washington May 20, 2025.(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) \"Citing ideology and national security as a pretext, the move seriously hurts the lawful rights and interests of international students from China and disrupts people-to-people exchanges between the two countries,\" spokesperson Lin Jian said. Nearly 300,000 Chinese nationals have student visas in the United States. It is unclear if the State Department plans to target all of them or only some. Fox News Digital reached out to the department for clarity. Below is a look at some recent incidents involving Chinese nationals at universities. The DOJ brought charges against five University of Michigan students last year after a sergeant major encountered them at Camp Grayling in 2023. The students had cameras with them and were discovered as the U.S. National Guard was conducting a massive training operation at the site with Taiwanese military members, according toa complaint. They were all Chinese nationals attending the University of Michigan as part of the school’s joint program with a Shanghai-based university, an FBI official wrote in the complaint, noting some of them had taken photos of Camp Grayling's military installations and operations. Marco Rubio and Xi Jinping(Getty Images) The FBI asked the court to issue arrest warrants for the students for making false statements and destroying records. Two Chinese nationals who were graduate students at the University of Michigan pleaded guilty in 2020 after they were caught illegally entering and photographing defense infrastructure at a naval air station in Key West, Florida. Fengyun Shi, a Chinese national studying at the University of Minnesota, was convicted in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia last year of unlawfully using a drone to take photos of naval bases in Norfolk, Virginia. Shi was sentenced to six months in prison and a year of supervised release, and the Biden administration revoked his visa in response to the charges. ICE announced in May that it deported him to China. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION BEGINS NEW WAVE OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENT VISA REVOCATIONS: 'NO ONE HAS A RIGHT TO A VISA' Fengyun Shi(ICE) While not a Chinese national, Charles Lieber, former chair of Harvard's chemistry department, was convicted in 2021 of making false statements to authorities and failing to report income from his work with China's Wuhan University of Technology and a contract he had with China's Thousand Talents Program. Ji Chaoqun, a Chinese national and one-time student at the Illinois Institute of Technology, was sentenced to eight years in prison after he was convicted by a jury in 2022 of attempting to commit espionage and theft of trade secrets. Ji was found to have gathered information on defense contractors, engineers and others as part of a broader effort by high-level Chinese intelligence officials to obtain inside access to U.S. technology advancements. Rubio's announcementalso comes after Harvard filed a lawsuit alleging the Trump administration improperly banned all foreign nationals from the Ivy League school by revoking its student visa certification. A judge temporarily blocked the administration from carrying out the ban as the case plays out in the courts. STATE DEPARTMENT NOW SCRUTINIZING ALL VISA HOLDERS ASSOCIATED WITH HARVARD Banners at the Harry Elkins Widener Memorial Library on the Harvard University campus in Cambridge, Mass., Tuesday, May 27, 2025.(Sophie Park/Bloomberg) ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons told Harvard in a letter made public through court filings that the revocation was a result of the alleged prevalence of antisemitism on campus but also a result of the administration's \"serious concerns\" that the university has \"coordinated with the Chinese Communist Party.\" Lyons cited several examples, including Harvard accepting $151 million from foreign donors since 2020, working with \"China-based academics\" on projects funded by an \"Iranian government agent,\" partnering with Chinese universities and using public funds to do so and collaborating with people \"linked to China’s defense-industrial base.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"This coordination is a valid and substantive reason for withdrawing Harvard University’s [Student Exchange Visitor Program] certification to enroll foreign students,\" Lyons wrote. Harvard attorneys argued during a court hearing Thursday that theTrump administrationdid not give the university a chance to rebut the claims about antisemitism and CCP ties before the foreign student ban was enacted. The administration agreed to give Harvard one month to respond to those claims while the ban remains on hold.

TheTexas Longhorns footballprogram maintains arguably some of the best — if not the top — amenities in the nation.

The charges stem from a December 2024 incident that left travelers stunned and security personnel injured.TEXAS MAN 'MAD' AT TRUMP ARRESTED, ACCUSED OF ASSAULTING FELLOW PASSENGER ON FLIGHT TO DC Cameron Dylan McDougall is restrained on the floor by TSA officers at Miami International Airport Dec. 28, 2024, in this screenshot from surveillance video.(Miami-Dade SAO/TMX) The trouble began Dec. 27, when McDougall allegedly struck a fellow passenger aboard aCopa Airlines flighttraveling from Panama City to Toronto. According to reporting fromLocal 10 News, the midair altercation prompted the pilot to divert the flight to Miami, where McDougall was removed from the plane but not arrested. Instead, he was told he could book another flight back to Canada. McDougall purchased a ticket on Air Canada for the following day. But as he prepared to board that flight at MIA the morning of Dec. 28, he once again lashed out, this time in the airport.

A security guard who attempted to intervene was also assaulted. Two minutes later, McDougall returned to the screening area and targeted a TSA supervisor, swinging wildly.

    "title": "Ooh la law: France snuffing out smoking in parks, beaches, more",
    "article_text": "French President Emmanuel Macron's wife is seen pushing his face in a viral clip during their arrival in Hanoi, Vietnam. The French governmentis cracking down on cigarettes in public, announcing a sweeping outdoor smoking ban that aims to clear the air for the next generation of Parisians (and everyone else). Beginning July 1, France will ban smoking in a wide range of outdoor public areas, including beaches, public parks, gardens, bus stops, sports venues and anywhere near schools, according to reporting from the BBC and Agence France-Presse (AFP). \"Tobacco must disappearwhere there are children,\" Health and Family Minister Catherine Vautrin told Ouest-France, a regional French newspaper, in an interview published Thursday.21,000% SPIKE IN MA VAPE SEIZURES THROWS CIGARETTE BAN INTO QUESTION, EX-ATF OFFICIAL SAYS A protester lights a cigarette during a demonstration organized by unions and youth organizations calling for the repeal of a pension law and the increase in salaries in Toulouse, France, on Oct. 1, 2024.(PAT BATARD/Hans Lucas via AFP/AFP via Getty Images) \"The freedom to smoke must end where the freedom of children to breathe fresh air begins.\" Under the new rules, lighting up in these designated areas could earn violators a fine of up to $153, as reported by AFP. Enforcement will primarily be handled by regular police, though Vautrin said she’s counting on a dose of \"self-regulation\" from the public. There’s a carve-out for culture, though. France’s iconic \"terrasses,\" the bustling outdoor café seating areas, are exempt from the ban. Smokers can still enjoy a cigarette with their espresso and croissant, provided they’re seated at a café. The BBC confirmed that these social spaces, which are practically a national institution, won’t be affected.SOUTH CAROLINA BILL WOULD BAN SMOKING INSIDE CARS WHILE CHILDREN ARE PASSENGERS A cigarette and tobacco shop in the 4th arrondissement of Paris is seen on Sept. 13, 2024.(ANTOINE BOUREAU/Hans Lucas/AFP via Getty Images) E-cigarettes are also currently excluded from the restrictions, but Vautrin told Ouest-France that her office is working on future limits to the nicotine levels allowed in vapes. The move marks a significant expansion of France’s existing anti-smoking laws. Smoking has already been banned in restaurants, nightclubs and indoor public places since 2008. Local efforts to restrictsmoking in public spaceshave been growing steadily. According to AFP, more than 1,500 French municipalities have already enacted their own outdoor smoking bans and hundreds of beaches have been smoke-free for years. A chef rolls a cigarette during a break outside a restaurant in Paris on April 8, 2025.(XAVIER GALIANA/AFP via Getty Images) According to data from the French Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction cited by the BBC, just 23.1% of French adults smoke daily, the lowest level ever recorded and a drop of over five percentage points since 2014. Still, tobacco-related illnesses remain a leading cause of death. France’s National Committee Against Smoking reports that more than 75,000 people die each year from smoking, around 13% of all annual deaths in the country. Support for the new restrictions appears strong. A report from La Ligue Contre le Cancer, a prominent French cancer association, found that nearly 80% of French citizens favor smoke-free public areas like parks, beaches and woodlands. But while many in France welcome the move, some have raised concerns over the balance between public health and personal liberty. Conservatives may see the ban as another example of top-down government overreach.

    "title": "California families of girl athletes speak out as state changes championship rules amid transgender drama",
    "article_text": "California girls' high school athletes reflect on their experience competing against a trans athlete in a postseason meet, as the state continues to defend its policies on gender eligibility. EXCLUSIVE:The California high school track and field state championship is shaping up to be one of themost unprecedentedhigh school sports events in recent history. Amid a national controversy involving a trans athlete competing in the girls' category, the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) announced a series ofsweeping rule changesin the days leading up to the event to accommodate female competitors. But now multiple families of girls who have already been displaced by a trans athlete at previous meets have spoken out against the federation, expressing dissatisfaction with the changes. On Tuesday, the CIF announced it would expand the size of the championship competition pool and inviting \"biological female\" athletes who missed out on making the title meet by one spot due to a trans athlete finishing ahead of them in last week's qualifying round. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM AB Hernandez of Jurupa Valley High competes in the girls' high jump during the CIF Southern Section Division 3 Track and Field preliminaries at Nathan Shapell Memorial Stadium at Yorba Linda High School on May 10, 2025, in Yorba Linda, Calif.(Kirby Lee/Getty Images) Then on Wednesday, the federation announced it would also recognize female athletes on the medal podium if a girl who misses out on a medal finish does so because they came behind a trans athlete. Crean Lutheran track and field star Reese Hogan finished in second place totrans athleteAB Hernandez of Jurupa Valley High School in the triple jump at the Southern Sectional final on May 17. Then, on the medal podium, after Hernandez stepped off, Hogan stepped up to the first-place spot for a photo-op to a roaring applause. The stunt went viral as Hogan was praised by women's sports rights activists as a heroine. But CIF's latest rule changes won't be giving Hogan the first-place medal for that event. Hogan's family provided a statement from her to Fox News Digital that read, \"The recent CIF rule changes clearly acknowledge a misstep on their part. However, what they've proposed falls short of what we truly need for all girls across all sports. I placed second in CIF, and I know that if I hadn't been competing against a boy, I would have claimed the top spot on the podium.\" \"Unfortunately, we can't revisit that moment to rectify this injustice. This issue transcends a single meet, sport, or individual; it’s fundamentally about the rights of all females to compete fairly among themselves. We deserve that opportunity, and we will continue to advocate for it.\" Hogan has previously told Fox News Digital she finds the situation involving Hernandez \"sad.\" \"It's just kind of sad just watching. He's obviously a really talented athlete, we've all seen him jump and stuff, and I wish him the best of luck, but in a boys' division,\" Hogan previously told Fox News Digital about competing against the athlete. \"It's pretty obvious the certain advantages that he has, and it's obviously just sad as a woman to watch that.\" Meanwhile, the family of Hogan's Crean Lutheran teammate, Olivia Viola, also isn't satisfied with the rule changes. \"While we are grateful that a few female athletes will regain their ability to compete at states and females will earn their rightful titles at this weekends competition, unfortunately CIFs trial program doesn’t actually fix anything. Women are still being forced to compete against biological males. The title IX civil rights of our daughters, sisters, friends and teammates are still being violated,\" Viola's family said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"Unfortunately, with each step our state leaders take, comes the realization that California really has no intention of protecting our girls in the ways that are necessary. The pilot program essentially admits that allowing biological males to compete in the female category was a mistake. Now it’s time for full course correction. There is a fundamental truth here that must be upheld. Separating competitive athletics into two XX-XY gender categories must be a non-negotiable.\" TEEN GIRLS OPEN UP ON TRANS-ATHLETE SCANDAL THAT TURNED THEIR HIGH SCHOOL INTO CULTURE WAR BATTLEGROUND Olivia Viola of Crean Lutheran competes in the girls' high jump during the CIF Southern Section Masters Meet at Moorpark High School on May 24, 2025, in Moorpark, Calif.(Kirby Lee/Getty Images) President Donald Trump weighed in on the situation when he sent a Truth Social post on Tuesday morning, warning the state and Gov. Gavin Newsom of potential funding cuts and orders to local authorities to prevent a trans athlete from competing in the girls' category on Saturday. The first rule change came just hours after Trump's post. The Department of Justice announced it would launch an investigation into the CIF and California Attorney General Rob Bonta over the state's law that allows biologically male trans athletes to compete with girls and women on Wednesday. The second rule change took place shortly after that announcement. On Tuesday, the family of another girls' track star who has been displaced by Hernandez in the track and field postseason, Katie McGuinness of La Canada High School, told Fox News Digital they are grateful for Trump's intervention. \"We are grateful that President Trump is fighting for female athletes and giving them a fair shot to compete on a level playing field. CIF's ‘solution’ to this situation, which allows additional girls to compete at the state championship who otherwise didn't qualify because the transgender athlete took their spot, isn't good enough – it's still an unfair competition and an injustice to the girls competing,\" the family said in a statement. \"Allowing biological males to compete in women’s sports is unfair, unjust and defies common sense,\" the family added.

The 14-year-old writing assistant startup will use the new funds for its sales and marketing efforts, freeing up existing capital to make strategic acquisitions. Unlike a traditional venture round, General Catalyst will not receive an equity stake in the company in return for the investment. Instead, Grammarly will repay the capital along with a fixed, capped percentage of revenue it generates from the use of General Catalyst’s funds. The investment comes from General Catalyst’s Customer Value Fund (CVF), a capital pool that helps late-stage startups with predictable revenue streams deploy new funding specifically to growing their businesses. CVF’s alternative financing strategy essentially “lends” capital that is secured by a company’s recurring revenue. For companies like Grammarly, this form of financing is advantageous because it’s nondilutive and does not reset the company’s valuation. Grammarly was valuedat $13 billion in 2021, during the peak of the ZIRP (zero interest-rate policy) era. However, the company’s valuation in today’s market is significantly lower, according to an investor in the company who asked to remain anonymous. Grammarly didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. In December, Grammarly acquired productivitystartup Codaand appointed its CEO, Shishir Mehrotra, to lead Grammarly. The company, which is evolving into an AI productivity tool following the acquisition, has annual revenue ofover $700 million. General Catalyst’s Customer Value Fund has provided funding tonearly 50 companies, including insurtech Lemonade and telehealth platform Ro. CVF maintains its own distinct limited partners and was not included in the firm’s recent $8 billion capital raise.

    "article_text": "A father-of-three and former Royal Marine has been charged following the Liverpool parade crash in which 79 people were injured. Paul Doyle, 53, from Burghill Road in West Derby, was arrested on Monday, when a car ploughed into fans attending Liverpool's Premier League victory celebration, Merseyside Police confirmed. He will appear at Liverpool Magistrates' Court on Friday morning. A nine-year-old was among those injured when the car Mr Doyle is alleged to have been driving crashed into supporters at 18:00 BST on Water Street. The local businessman faces multiple counts of causing, and attempting to cause unlawful and malicious grievous bodily harm with intent as well as one of dangerous driving and two counts of unlawful and malicious wounding with intent. Assistant Chief Constable Jenny Sims, of Merseyside Police, told a news conference seven people remain in hospital after the incident. The BBC has spoken to the suspect's neighbours, who said they were shocked and in \"disbelief\". They said that Burghill Road was swarming with police in the hours after the crash. One said: \"I came out late on Monday night and there's police everywhere. Looking around all the houses, so I had a thought - imagine if it was him?\" Assistant Chief Constable Jenny Sims said detectives were reviewing a \"huge volume\" of CCTV and mobile phone footage. Sarah Hammond, Chief Crown Prosecutor for Crown Prosecution Service in the Mersey-Cheshire region, said this included footage from CCTV, mobile phones, businesses and dashcams, along with witness statements. She said the charges \"will be kept under review\" while the investigation progresses. \"It is important to ensure every victim gets the justice they deserve,\" she added. Mr Doyle has been charged with seven offences, which can be broken down into four groups. The first includes two counts of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm  (GBH) – one of these is an alleged offence against one child. The second is two counts of causing unlawful and malicious GBH with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. According to the Sentencing Council, it relates to the nature of the injury allegedly caused. GBH does not require an open wound to have been suffered. Wounding requires the victim's skin to have been broken. Mr Doyle also faces two charges of attempted unlawful and malicious GBH with intent to cause GBH, and again one of these alleged offences relates to a child. The final count is dangerous driving. Police confirmed the ages of those injured in the incident ranged from nine to 78. Assistant Chief Constable Sims, said she understood many have questions about the incident, and detectives were \"working tirelessly, with diligence and professionalism, to seek the answer to all of those questions\". \"When we are able to, we will provide further information,\" she added.

    "title": "Trump tariffs can stay in place for now, appeals court rules",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump can keep collecting import taxes for now, an appeals court has said, a day after a trade ruling found the bulk of his global tariffs to be illegal. A federal appeals court granted a bid from the White House to temporarily suspend the lower court's order, which ruled that Trump had overstepped his power by imposingthe duties. Wednesday's judgement from the US Court of International Trade drew the ire of Trump officials, who called it an example of judicial overreach. Small businesses and a group of states had challenged the measures, which are at the heart of Trump's agenda and have shaken up the world economic order. In its appeal, the Trump administration said the decision issued by the trade court a day earlier had improperly second-guessed the president and threatened to unravel months of hard-fought trade negotiations. \"The political branches, not courts, make foreign policy and chart economic policy,\" it said in the filing. Shortly before Thursday's tariff reprieve from the appeals court, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told a press briefing: \"America cannot function if President Trump, or any other president, for that matter, has their sensitive diplomatic or trade negotiations railroaded by activist judges.\" Trump blasted the lower court ruling on Thursday in a social media post, writing: \"Hopefully, the Supreme Court will reverse this horrible, Country threatening decision, QUICKLY and DECISIVELY.\" Wednesday's decision by the little-known trade court in New York would void tariffs imposed by Trump in February on goods from China, Mexico and Canada, which he justified as a move intended to address a fentanyl smuggling. The lower court's decision would also dismiss a blanket 10% import tax that Trump unveiled last month on goods from countries around the world, together with higher so-called reciprocal tariffs on trade partners, including the EU and China. The 1977 law Trump invoked to impose many of the tariffs, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, did not allow for such sweeping levies without input from Congress, the lower court said. But its ruling did not affect Trump's tariffs on cars, steel and aluminium, which were implemented under another law. The White House has suspended or revised many of its duties while trade negotiations grind on. But the appeals court decision allow the tariffs to be used for now while the case is litigated. The next hearing is on 5 June. On Thursday, another federal court overseeing a separate tariffs case reached a similar conclusion to the trade court. Judge Rudolph Contreras found the duties went beyond the president's authority, but his ruling only applied to a toy company in the case. Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro told reporters on Thursday: \"You can assume that even if we lose [in court], we will do it [tariffs] another way.\" No court has struck down tariffs on cars, steel and aluminium that Trump imposed citing national-security concerns under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. He could expand import taxes under that law to other sectors such as semiconductors and lumber. The president could also invoke Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which he invoked for his first-term tariffs on China. A separate 1930 trade law, Section 338 of the Trade Act, which has not been used for decades, allows the president to impose tariffs of up to 50% on imports from countries that \"discriminate\" against the US. But the White House seems more focused for now on challenging the court rulings. The matter may is widely expected to end up at the Supreme Court. Lawyer Ilya Somin, who helped work on the case brought by businesses before the trade court, said he was \"guardedly optimistic\" the ruling would ultimately be upheld on appeal. He noted that the trade court order came from justices appointed by both Democratic and Republican presidents, including one by Trump himself. \"It's not normal for the president of the United States to make such an enormous power grab and start the biggest trade war since the Great Depression,\" he said. But Terry Haines, founder of the Pangaea Policy, which advises firms on Washington policies, said he thought \"the president is probably going to be given the benefit of the doubt\" by the courts. Business owners, while expressing hope, said they did not yet feel like the situation was resolved. \"I was incredibly happy and relieved but I'm also still very cautious,\" said Kara Dyer, the owner of Boston-based Story Time Toys, which makes toys in China and imports them to the US for sale. \"It's just been so chaotic and so impossible to plan as a business,\" she said. \"I want this to work its way through our court system so we have a little bit more certainty about what tariffs will be in the future.\" Dmitry Grozoubinski, a former trade negotiator who represented Australia at the World Trade Organization, said the court battle had weakened Trump's ability to use the duties for leverage over other countries. \"It will be a lot harder for him to raise tariffs in the future,\" he said. \"This was ultimately a negotiation in which President Trump was threatening other countries with a big stick and that stick just got considerably more ephemeral.\" With reporting from the BBC's World Business Report and Opening Bell.

    "title": "Hamas official says it rejects new US Gaza ceasefire plan backed by Israel",
    "article_text": "A senior Hamas official has told the BBC the Palestinian armed group will reject the latest US proposal for a new Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal. The White House said on Thursday that Israel had \"signed off\" on US envoy Steve Witkoff's plan and that it was waiting for a formal response from Hamas. Israeli media cited Israeli officials as saying it would see Hamas hand over 10 living hostages and the bodies of 18 dead hostages in two phases in exchange for a 60-day ceasefire and the release of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. The Hamas official said the proposal did not satisfy core demands, including an end to the war, and that it would respond in due course. The Israeli government has not commented, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly told hostages' families on Thursday that he accepted Witkoff's plan. Israel imposed a total blockade on Gaza and resumed its military offensive against Hamas on 18 March following the collapse of a two-month ceasefire brokered by the US, Qatar and Egypt. It said it wanted to put pressure on Hamas to release the 58 hostages it is still holding, at least 20 of whom are believed to be alive. On 19 May, the Israeli military launched an expanded offensive that Netanyahu said would see troops \"take control of all areas\" of Gaza. The next day, he said Israel would also ease the blockade and allow a \"basic\" amount of food into Gaza to prevent a famine. Almost 4,000 people have been killed in Gaza over the past 10 weeks, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The UN says another 600,000 people have been displaced again by Israeli ground operations and evacuation orders, and a report by the UN-backed IPC warns that about500,000 people face catastrophic levels of hungerin the coming months. At a news conference in Washington DC on Thursday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked whether she could confirm a report by Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya TV that Israel and Hamas had agreed a new ceasefire deal. \"I can confirm that Special Envoy Witkoff and the president submitted a ceasefire proposal to Hamas that Israel backed and supported. Israel signed off on this proposal before it was sent to Hamas,\" she said. \"I can also confirm that those discussions are continuing, and we hope that a ceasefire in Gaza will take place so we can return all of the hostages home,\" she added. However, a senior Hamas official later said the deal contradicted previous discussions between the group's negotiators and Witkoff. The official told the BBC that the offer did not include guarantees the temporary truce would lead to a permanent ceasefire, nor a return to the humanitarian protocol that allowed hundreds of trucks of aid into Gaza daily during the last ceasefire. Nevertheless, he said Hamas remained in contact with the mediators and would submit its written response in due course. Earlier, Israel's Channel 12 TV reported the Netanyahu told hostages' families at a meeting: \"We agree to accept the latest Witkoff plan that was conveyed to us tonight. Hamas has not yet responded. We do not believe Hamas will release the last hostage, and we will not leave the Strip until all the hostages are in our hands.\" His office later issued a statement accusing one of the channel's reporters of trying to \"smuggle\" a recording device into the room where the meeting took place. But it did not deny that he had agreed to the US proposal. Netanyahu has previously said that Israel will end the war only when all the hostages are released, Hamas is either destroyed or disarmed, and its leaders have been sent into exile. Hamas has said it is ready to return all of those held captive, in exchange for a complete end to hostilities and full Israeli pull-out from Gaza. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response Hamas' cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Another four people, two of them dead, were already being held captive in Gaza before the conflict. So far, Israel has secured the return of 197 hostages, 148 of them alive, mostly through two temporary ceasefire deals with Hamas. At least 54,249 people have been killed in Gaza during the war, including 3,986 since Israel resumed its offensive, according to the territory's health ministry. On Thursday, at least 54 people were killed by Israeli strikes across Gaza, according to the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency. They included 23 people who died when a home in the central Bureij area was hit, it said. The Israeli military said it had struck \"dozens of terror targets\" over the past day. Scenes of chaos and looting in parts of Gaza persist as food shortages continue. The biggest such move in years is condemned by the Palestinian presidency as a \"dangerous escalation\". Mohammed Sinwar was the target of a Israeli strike on the courtyard of the European hospital in Khan Younis on 13 May. The Israeli military says troops fired warning shots into the air but not at Palestinians during Tuesday's incident in Rafah. Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, says the bloc also does not support a new aid distribution model which bypasses the UN and other humanitarian organisations.",

    "title": "Badenoch accuses Starmer and Farage of 'fantasy economics'",
    "article_text": "Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has accused Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage of indulging in \"fantasy economics\" over their approaches to welfare policies. Writing in the Daily Mail, Badenoch says both leaders believe in getting struggling taxpayers to \"fund unlimited child support for others\". Her commentary comes after the Labour government indicated that it was looking at the possibility ofscrapping the two-child benefitcap. Farage said earlier this week that his party would also get rid of the policy andback more generous tax breaksfor married people. Badenoch added the country could not \"afford their fantasy economics\" and that Britain deserved leaders who did not \"treat economics like a branch of showbiz\". \"This week we have seen Labour and Reform in a race to the bottom to scrap the two-child benefit cap,\"she wrote. \"Starmer and Farage now believe in getting taxpayers - many of whom are struggling to raise their own children or choosing not to have them in the first place - to fund unlimited child support for others.\" The Conservatives have said the policy - which they introduced - of limiting means-tested benefits to just two children in most families should not be scrapped. Reform UK have pledged to remove the cap if they win power, but have not detailed how they would fund the billions it, and all their other pledges, would cost. In a speech this week, Farage said he wanted to lift the cap \"not because we support a benefits culture\" but because it would ease the burden on lower-paid workers. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has said the government is looking at scrapping the two-child benefit cap but warned it would \"cost a lot of money\". Speaking on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg show last week, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner refused to confirm whether the government would remove the policy. Pressure has also grown from Labour backbenchers over the issue since the party's poor performance at the local elections earlier this year. Badenoch's attack comes after Farage said this week the Conservatives had become an \"irrelevance\". For his part, Sir Keir said the Conservatives had \"run out of road\", were in \"decline\" and \"sliding into the abyss\". Badenoch argued her party was now \"the only major political party to take a serious look at the welfare state\". The party would be the UK's first to accept the cryptocurrency as regulation discussion continues. Historic social media posts on Mark Broadhurst's Facebook account compared Islamic dress to \"bin bags\". The prime minister's comments suggest he sees Reform UK as his principal political adversary. The new mayor of Hull and East Yorkshire pledges to put the region ahead of party politics. Two by-elections will be held in July for wards on North Tyneside Council.",

    "title": "Tariffs court fight threatens Trump's power to wield his favourite economic weapon",
    "article_text": "Since returning to power, US President Donald Trump has wielded tariffs – or the threat of them - as his economic weapon of choice. He has slapped import duties against allies and adversaries alike, and raised their rates to staggeringly high levels, only to change his mind and abruptly pause or reduce the charges. Markets and global leaders have scrambled trying to guess his next moves, while major retailers have warned of rising prices for American consumers and potentially empty shelves in shops. The president has claimed this power to impose tariffs unilaterally. He says that as president he is responding to a national economic emergency - and he cannot wait for Congress to pass legislation. In effect, this meant firing off a threatening missive to a country playing hardball was as easy as posting on Truth Social (just ask the European Union, which he called \"very difficult to deal with\" in negotiations last week). However, late on Wednesday, the US Court of International Trade ruled that he had exceeded the authority of the emergency powers he was using. The court gave the White House 10 days to remove almost all tariffs, which it says have been imposed illegally. The White House appealed, and a federal appeals court has stayed the trade court's ruling, which means that those tariffs will stay in place - for now. The administration argued in its appeal that a ruling against Trump \"would kneecap the president on the world stage, cripple his ability to negotiate trade deals, imperil the government's ability to respond to these and future national emergencies\". On Thursday night, Trump was back on Truth Social, rebuking the lower court judges who had ruled against him, calling their decision \"wrong\" and \"horrible\". Until now, the power to make or break the economy has rested on his shoulders, as the tariff rates levelled against other countries keep going up and down – seemingly according to Trump's mood. He raised the tariffs on imported Chinese goods all the way up to 145% before dropping them down to 30%. A few weeks later he used a social media post to threaten the EU with 50% tariffs, before backing down a couple of days later. Wall Street analysts have even reportedly now coined the phrase \"Taco trade\", referring to their belief that Trump Always Chickens Out from imposing steep import taxes. He looked furious when asked about the acronym in the Oval Office on Wednesday. \"That's a nasty question\" he said, arguing that it was only by making these threats that he got the EU to the negotiating table. Trump's ambassador to the EU during his first term, Gordon Sondland, told the BBC this erratic approach was by design. \"What Trump is doing is exactly what he would do as a business person. He would immediately find a point of leverage to get someone's attention today. Not next month, not next year... he wants to have these conversations now,\" he said earlier this week, before the latest legal twists. \"How do you get someone as intransigent and as slow moving as the EU to do something now? You slap a 50% tariff on them and all of a sudden the phone start ringing.\" If Trump's tariffs plan continues to meet resistance in the courts, one option at his disposal is asking Congress to legislate the taxes instead. But that would eliminate one of his biggest tools - the element of surprise. For decades, Trump has been convinced that trade tariffs are the answer to many of America's economic problems. He has appeared to welcome the prospect of global trade war sparked by his tariff agenda, insisting that it is by raising the price of imported goods and reviving the US manufacturing sector that he will \"Make America Great Again\". Trump touts the money - billions of dollars, not trillions, as he says - that tariffs have already brought in to US government coffers. The president argues they will help to revive American manufacturing by persuading firms to move their factories to the US to avoid import duties. However, University of Michigan economics professor Justin Wolfers described Trump's methods as \"madness\". \"If you believe in tariffs, what you want is for businesses to understand that the tariffs are going to... be permanent so that they can make investments around that and that's what would lead the factories to come to the United States,\" he told the BBC. He said that whatever happens with this court challenge, Trump has already transformed the global economic order. Prof Wolfers said while Trump \"chickens out from the very worst mistakes\" - citing his original 'Liberation Day' levies and the threat of 50% tariffs on the EU - he doesn't backflip on everything. The president wants to keep 10% reciprocal tariffs on most countries and 25% tariffs on cars, steel and aluminium. \"Yes, he backs off the madness, but even the stuff he left in meant that we had the highest tariff rate yesterday than we'd had since 1934,\" Prof Wolfers said. All signs point to this being a fight that the Republican president won't give up easily. \"You can assume that even if we lose, we will do it another way,\" Trump's trade advisor Peter Navarro said after Thursday's appeals court ruling. While the litigation plays out, America's trade partners will be left guessing about Trump's next move, which is exactly how he likes it.

    "title": "Five ways the world's richest man changed the White House",
    "article_text": "Elon Musk's time in the Trump administration is coming to an end after a tempestuous 129 days in which the world's richest man took an axe to government spending - stirring ample controversy along the way. Earlier this week, the South African-born billionaire, on his social media platform, X, thanked President Trump for histime at the Department of Government Efficiency, or Doge. Trump announced he will host a news conference in the Oval Office on Friday with Musk, writing: \"This will be his last day, but not really, because he will, always, be with us, helping all the way.\" While Musk's time in government lasted little more than four months, his work with Doge upended the federal government and had an impact not just in the halls of power in Washington - but around the world. Let's take a look at some of the ways Musk has left a mark. Musk took a job with the Trump White House with one mission: to cut spending from the government as much as possible. He began with an initial target of \"at least $2 trillion\", which then shifted to $1tn and ultimately $150bn. To date, Doge claims to have saved $175bn through a combination of asset sales, lease and grant cancellations, \"fraud and improper payment deletion\", regulatory savings and a 260,000-person reduction from the 2.3 million-strong federal workforce. ABBC analysis of those figures,however, found that evidence is sometimes lacking. This mission has at times caused both chaos and controversy, including some instances in which federal judges halted mass firings and ordered employees reinstated. In other instances, the administration has been forced to backtrack on firings. In one notable instance in February, the administration stopped the firing of hundreds of federal employees working at the National Nuclear Security Administration, including some with sensitive jobs related to the US nuclear arsenal. Musk himself repeatedly acknowledged that mass firings would inevitably include mistakes. \"We will make mistakes,\" he said in February, after his department mistook a region of Mozambique for Hamas-controlled Gaza while cutting an aid programme. \"But we'll act quickly to correct any mistakes.\" Doge's efforts to access data also garnered controversy, particularly the department's push for access to sensitive treasury department systems that control the private information of millions of Americans. Polls show that cuts to government spending remain popular with many Americans - even if Musk's personal popularity has waned. The presence of Musk - an unelected \"special government employee\" with companies that count the US government as customers - in Trump's White House has also raised eyebrows, prompting questions about potential conflicts of interest. His corporate empire includes large companies that do business with US and foreign governments. SpaceX has $22 billion in US government contracts, according to the company's chief executive. Some Democrats also accused Musk of taking advantage of his position to drum up business abroad for his satellite internet services firm, Starlink. The White House was accused of helping Musk's businesses by showcasing vehicles made by Tesla - his embattled car company - on the White House lawn in March. Musk and Trump have both shrugged off any suggestion that his work with the government is conflicted or ethically problematic. Around the world, Musk's work with Doge was most felt after the vast majority - over 80% - of the US Agency for International Development's (USAID's) programmes were eliminated following a six-week review by Doge. The rest were absorbed by the State Department. The Musk and Doge-led cuts formed part of a wider effort by the Trump administration to bring overseas spending closer in line with its \"America First\" approach. The cuts to the agency - tasked with work such as famine detection, vaccinations and food aid in conflict areas - quickly had an impact on projects includingcommunal kitchens in war-torn Sudan, scholarshipsfor young Afghan womenwho fled the Taliban and clinicsfor transgender people in India. USAID also was a crucial instrument of US \"soft power\" around the world, leading some detractors pointing to its elimination as a sign of waning American influence on the global stage. While Musk - and Trump - have for years been accused by detractors of spreading baseless conspiracy theories, Musk's presence in the White House starkly highlighted how misinformation has crept into discourse at the highest levels of the US government. For example, Musk spread an unfounded internet theory that US gold reserves had quietly been stolen from Fort Knox in Kentucky. At one point, he floated the idea of livestreaming a visit there to ensure the gold was secured. More recently,Musk spread widely discredited rumours that the white Afrikaner population of South Africa is facing \"genocide\" in their home country. Those rumours found their way into the Oval Office earlier in May, when a meeting aimed at soothing tensions between the US and South Africa took a drastic twist after Trump presented South African President Cyril Ramaphosa with videos and articles he said were evidence of crimes against Afrikaners. Musk's work in government also showed that, despite public pledges of unity, there are tensions within the \"Trump 2.0\" administration. While Trump publicly - and repeatedly - backed the work of Musk and Doge, Musk's tenure was marked by reports of tension between him and members of the cabinet who felt Doge cuts were impacting their agencies. \"They have a lot of respect for Elon and that he's doing this, and some disagree a little bit,\" Trump acknowledged in a February cabinet meeting. \"If they aren't, I want them to speak up.\" At one point, he was asked whether any cabinet members had expressed dissatisfaction with Musk and turned to the room to ask them. No one spoke. The announcement of Musk's departure also came the same day CBS - BBC's US partner - publicised part of an interview during which Musk said he was\"disappointed\" by Trump's \"big, beautiful\" budget bill.The bill includes multi-trillion dollar tax breaks and a pledge to increase defence spending. Musk said the bill \"undermines\" the work of Doge to cut spending - reflecting larger tensions within the Republican Party over the path forward.

    "title": "Overcoming struggles & Taylor's advice - Humphries seals triple crown",
    "article_text": "Luke Humphries avenged his Premier League defeat to Luke Littler in 2024 with an 11-8 victory at London's O2 Arena The joy on Luke Humphries' face was there for all to see. Less than two months on from saying hefelt \"emotionless\"on the oche due to a relentless playing schedule that had made darts a \"chore\", the world number one was full of emotions. Havingbeaten Luke Littler to claim his maiden Premier League title, there was no shortage of delight, satisfaction or relief on display as Humphries stood triumphant in front of a packed O2 Arena with tears glistening in his eyes. \"It's about when I had those struggles in March,\" the 30-year-old said. \"It felt hard work and everything you dedicate yourself for, it makes it worthwhile when you achieve things like this. \"It's emotional because you work so hard, you're away from home for so long to get them trophies. It means the world. \"I do believe I've got that mental strength. I said earlier, if I win the title, I know I'll have won it by mental strength and belief. I feel like that was the case. \"In the final I was 3-0 down and could easily have let that slip away from me but I used mental strength to keep myself in the game.\" Humphries, who was world champion in 2024, has previouslyreflected on his rise to the top of the sporthaving had mental health challenges and anxiety at times in his career. He considered quitting the sport after one anxiety attack on stage in 2018. But having overcome those struggles to add another major title to his tally, after his most recent victory, Humphries was already looking ahead to the future. \"I'm still relatively young in the game and I'm only a couple of titles away from being possibly the third-most successful darts player,\" he added. \"But when you reach 10 major titles, you're in some unseen territory so I'll keep pushing. I want to get over 10 so hopefully I can do that in the next couple of years.\" Humphries beats Littler to get Premier League revenge 'Look at him crying' - Littler's rise in his own words Premier League Darts final schedule and prize money Luke Humphries has now completed darts' triple crown of the World Championship, World Matchplay and Premier League In winning the Premier League, Humphries became just the fourth player to complete darts' triple crown - that also includes the World Championship and the World Matchplay. \"It feels amazing. There are only four people who have done it so that makes it really, really special,\" he said. Speaking to Sky Sports, he added: \"I've joined an elite club with Gary Anderson, Phil Taylor and Michael van Gerwen. \"I must say to Phil Taylor a big 'thank you' because he's been giving me a lot of support the past few weeks. It's really helped me so Phil if you are watching, thank you. \"He's given me a lot of advice and that extra boost.\" Humphries insisted the advice he received from 16-time world champion would stay between the two of them but confirmed it was solely about himself rather than any of his rivals. \"He was telling me stuff about myself and just believing in me,\" Humphries said. \"When you get the greatest darts player in the world showing a bit of support and belief in you, it makes you feel good.\" Luke Humphries (left) and Luke Littler (right) have faced each other in 23 finals Victory was also payback for Humphries after helost last year's final to Littleras their rivalry continues to grow. Since first playing each other in the 2024 World Championship final, the pair have faced off a further 22 times with Littler claiming 13 wins to Humphries' 10. They are the two top-ranked players in the world and over the past 18 months, that has been abundantly clear. When they are on top form, it feels as if the other is the only player who can live with them. Add in the consistency with which they are able to reach that level and it is little wonder the Littler-Humphries rivalry is being talked about as one that could dominate darts for years to come. \"These two could have darts sewn up,\" Sky Sports pundit Wayne Mardle said. \"They are going to be the mainstay of the darting world. Others are going to have to play really well to get the better of these two. \"If they have that hunger for four, five, six or even 10 years then someone is going to have to step up.\" Asked if he felt that he and Littler would be fighting it out at the top for the next 10 or 15 years, Humphries was less convinced. \"The problem is, there's always another person who comes around the corner,\" he said. \"In five years' time there could be about 10 players who are as good as me and Luke and it could be a battle between us all. \"I'd love to say over the next 10 years we'll battle it out in many finals â and we probably will â but they'll probably be a lot of other names involved with us.\" For the time being, though, Humphries and Littler have put some distance between themselves and the chasing pack. But even after 23 matches against each other in such a short space of time, there is no sign of familiarity breeding contempt just yet. \"I love him. I think he's a good kid,\" Humphries said of his teenage competitor. \"He's a close friend of mine in darts. He'll probably win much more than I'll ever win in my career because he's young and he's a great talent. \"I'm just happy when I nab one here and there. I said to him on the stage, I'm really happy to win this but I'm sure he'll get me back plenty of times in the future. \"It's just another final in the Luke and Luke saga.\" The next stage in the saga will see the rivals become team-mates as they join forces for England at June's World Cup of Darts in Frankfurt. \"I cannot wait,\" Littler told Sky Sports. \"He won it last year so hopefully he can lead me to victory.\" They should form a formidable duo but it is only a matter of time before they will be battling it out again on the oche in a major tournament. And next time it is Littler, rather than Humphries, who might have a bit of revenge on his mind.

    "article_text": "Four people jailed in the landmark national security trial of the “Hong Kong47”, the pro-democracy figures accused of conspiracy to commit subversion, were freed on Friday after more than four years behind bars, the second group to be released in a month. Among those freed was longtime political and LGBTQ activist Jimmy Sham, who also led one of Hong Kong’s largest pro-democracy groups, the Civil Human Rights Front, which disbanded in 2021. CHRF was one of the largest pro-democracy groups in the former British colony and helped to organise million-strong marches during pro-democracy protests in 2019. The others who were released were Kinda Li, Roy Tam and Henry Wong. Local media reported some of the four arriving at their homes early on Friday. Sham told reporters he would see them “in the afternoon”. “I want to reserve some time for my family,” he said in Cantonese, according to Hong Kong Free Press. Li reportedly thanked gathered reporters “for the hard work” before moving inside. The four are the second group of the Hong Kong 47 to be released. At the end of April, former pro-democracy lawmakers Claudia Mo, Kwok Ka-ki, Jeremy Tam and Gary Fan werereleased from three separate prisonsacross Hong Kong around dawn. The 47 pro-democracy campaigners were arrested and charged in early 2021 with conspiracy to commit subversion under a Beijing-imposed national law which carried sentences of up to life in prison. Forty-five of these were convicted after a marathon trial, with sentences of up to 10 years. Only two were acquitted. The democrats were found guilty of organising an unofficial “primary election” in 2020 to select candidates for a legislative election. Prosecutors accused the activists of plotting to paralyse the government by winning a majority of seats and blocking government bills to force a dissolution. . The election was postponed, and rescheduled after an electoral overhaul that ensured only pro-Beijing “patriots” could run. Human rights groups and some western governments including the US called the trial politically motivated and had demanded the democrats be freed. Hong Kong and Beijing, however, say all are equal under the national security laws and the democrats received a fair trial. Since large and sustained pro-democracy protests erupted in Hong Kong for most of 2019, China has cracked down on the democratic opposition as well as liberal civil society and media outlets undersweeping national security lawsthat have broadly criminalised dissenting behaviours, including benign acts of protest.",

Wildlife smuggler handed nine-month jail sentence over live tortoises and turtles A man was sentenced to nine months in prison after pleading guilty toillegally importing live tortoises and turtlesinto Australia. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (Daff) said the Australian Border Force discovered a package sent from the Philippines in March 2023 thatwas emitting a smell. X-rays revealed it contained reptiles and spiders, and a DAFF later discovered three snakes, six iguanas, three soft shell turtles and three tarantulas inside. Many were dead. A two-year investigation later uncovered creatures at other locations linked to an illegal exotic trafficking gang, includinghog nose snakes, eco-skeleton spiders and an African hedgehog, among others. Justine Saunders, the deputy secretary of biosecurity, operations and compliance at the Daff, said officials remained “united in their commitment to eradicate the illicit wildlife trade”, adding: Daff has more than a thousand biosecurity officers working at our borders and in mailrooms every day who are trained to pick up anomalies in the system. The illegal wildlife trade is the world’s fourth largest illicit transnational trade, after arms, drugs and human trafficking.

Watch his speech below: And read more from the Guardian’s Bertin Huynh here: Fourth man charged over alleged looting in flood-hit Taree NSW police have charged a man on allegations he was in possession of stolen itemson the flood-hit mid-north coast. Police said they stopped a cyclist during their rounds in Taree yesterday and searched his bags. The search allegedly revealed several itemssuspected of being stolen, including a credit card, jewellery and watches. The man, 37, was arrested and charged with six counts of goods in personal custody suspected being stolen, the possession of housebreaking implements and another charge linked to a bicycle helmet. Three others have been charged with similar allegations this week linked to the flooding. Those allegations remain before the courts.

    "title": "One Nation picks up four Senate spots, with surprise NSW seat for former British soldier Warwick Stacey",
    "article_text": "One Nation has gained an unexpected Senate seat inNew South Wales, taking Pauline Hanson’s party to four members in the upper house – equalling its best-ever result in a federal election. Warwick Stacey, a former member of the British army, has snagged the sixth Senate seat in NSW and will join fellow new senator Tyron Whitten who wasyesterday elected in Western Australia. Labor and Liberal each won two seats in NSW, in the results announced on Friday morning, alongside Mehreen Faruqi for the Greens. Labor’s Tony Sheldon was elected first, alongside colleague and industry, innovation and science minister Tim Ayres, while Andrew Bragg was elected second ahead of fellow Liberal Jess Collins. Faruqi was elected in position five, with Stacey in the sixth and final spot. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The result in NSW, the final jurisdiction to have its senators named, confirms the final makeup of the Senate pathway for the government to pass legislation. It leaves Labor with 28 senators in total, with the Coalition on 27, the Greens on 11, and 10 crossbenchers: four fromOne Nation, as well as Jacqui Lambie, David Pocock, Tammy Tyrrell, Ralph Babet, Fatima Payman and Lidia Thorpe. The parliamentary maths means Labor can pass legislation with the support of either the Coalition or the Greens alone, or the majority of the diverse crossbench. This may see the likes of Lambie and Pocock, influential in the last parliament, sidelined more than the previous term. In Labor’s first term, if the Coalition would not back legislation, the government needed the votes of the Greens plus a small number of crossbenchers. This time, the Greens on their own can offer a pathway to passing bills. Stacey will join Hanson, Whitten and the re-elected Malcolm Roberts in Queensland, taking the One Nation contingent to four in the Senate. That equals the party’s best result in the 2016 double-dissolution election – where the amount of votes to win a Senate quota is lower – when they had four senators elected: Hanson, Roberts, Brian Burston and Rod Culleton. Burston and Culleton would later quit One Nation over disputes with Hanson and the party. In an interview on Sky News, Hanson claimed more conservative voters had backed One Nation because the Coalition had “sat on the fence”. “The thing is, they [the Coalition] are not going to pick up those Greens or Labor voters at all with their policies. They’re staunch Labor voters or the Greens, there’s no way you’re going to contend with them,” she claimed. “People say we’re extreme right. That is ridiculous to say that. We’re more of a centrist party than extreme right.” Stacey’s bio on the One Nation website states he has a “lifetime of experience outside the political bubble”, citing policy priorities including limiting migration, supporting coal and nuclear energy, rejecting the net zero emissions target and boosting local manufacturing. A bio postedon social mediaby Australians for Constitutional Monarchy, the prominent monarchist group which endorsed him for the Senate, said Stacey had joined the British army and was later commissioned into the British army’s parachute regiment, later serving as as a troop commander with the Special Air Service Regiment. The description states Stacey later served 10 years in the Australian Army Reserve, before working as a military consultant in the Middle East and India, including advising on ransom, kidnap and crisis events. Informationpublishedon the Australian Army Research Centre states Stacey advised on more than 40 kidnap, extortion, piracy and related life-threatening incidents, and case managed dozens more.An alumni bioon the Sydney Grammar School website that appears to be written by Stacey says he speaks French, Arabic, Farsi, German and Spanish, and that his crisis management work had included dealing with kidnappings in Latin America. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion The information about Stacey’s military record is not listed in his One Nation biography, but was corroborated by him ona podcastin March. He said he was born in Sydney, brought up in Victoria and travelled to Europe “because of my interest in languages”. “While I was there, I fell into the British army. So effectively, I spent eight years as a professional soldier in the British army. I was commissioned into the parachute regiment, and I later served with 22 SAS,” Stacey told the podcast. “After I left the army, I worked in the Middle East as a military contractor, and doing that was very interesting work.” Stacey said he later started his own business in crisis management, which he claimed included work responding to extortion attempts as well as “Somali piracy”. “I was a kidnap for ransom response consultant and advising clients on how to successfully resolve a kidnap, how to negotiate a ransom and to get the return of the victim,” he said. Guardian Australia attempted to contact Stacey for comment. A One Nation source, who said Stacey was currently overseas for personal reasons, confirmed he had spent time in the British military and was involved in crisis management, but did not confirm the particulars. Guardian Australia spoke to Stacey last month, at the ballot draw for the NSW Senate. “Australia needs people to stand up, not to complain. If you complain, stand up. And I complain and I’m standing up. I love the challenge. It’s hard work, but I enjoy hard work,” he said. Despite being drawn sixth on the ballot, Stacey said: “We are going to win anyway. I think the state of the nation and the sentiment and temper of the people are looking at a change.” Additional reporting by Sarah Basford Canales and Luca Ittimani",

    "title": "Alleged attack on Chinese couple leads 30,000 people to sign petition to toughen Australian youth crime laws",
    "article_text": "A violent attack on a couple inSydneyhas sparked outrage in the Chinese community with almost 30,000 people signing a petition urging the New South Wales government to “urgently reform youth criminal justice”. The man, 42, and woman, 40, both from China, were allegedly assaulted in Eastgardens in Sydney on 22 May by seven children. The woman was left with extensive bruising across her body, fractured fingers and impaired vision. The group – aged between 12 and 16 – were arrested in the days after the alleged attack and police have charged six with assault. On Friday morning, just over 29,000 people had signed a petition calling for a lowering of the minimum age of criminal responsibility to 10 for “serious violent crimes” and to “deny bail to repeat violent youth offenders”. The age of responsibility is already 10 in NSW. Ami, who asked for her name to be changed, has signed the petition. She told Guardian Australia she was attacked in May while cycling through Redfern but says she does not “believe sending kids to adult jail is the right solution”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Erin Chew, co-founder of the Asian Australian Alliance, which monitors anti-Chinese incidents, said personal safety is important to the community and it was affecting its response to this crime. “I think, as Asians, we are taught as young kids to have more hypervigilance,” Chew said. “When we go to countries like Australia, US or Canada … we are a visible minority. So we are actually a lot … more targets of opportunity in that sense.” Chew said the alleged Eastgardens attack “may not necessarily be direct racism”. “A lot of us who are Chinese or Asians know that because of racial stereotypes … you are perceived as being weak, meek and … somebody that doesn’t fight back.” Speaking in NSW parliament on Wednesday in response to the recent attacks, Chinese Australian MP Jason Yat-Sen Li said “racism doesn’t need to be proven in court to be real in people’s lives” and argued for tackling the root causes of youth crime: “poverty, disengagement and trauma to young people and their families”. The Chinese-speaking community in Australia has taken to social media to post about their experiences and offer advice on how to fight back. Some have posted images of batons, rolling pins and even electric hair clippers as weapons to use in self-defence. NSW police has warned people not take the law into their own hands. In a statement, police said they “do not support vigilante behaviour as it is a risk to all involved and often leads to unintended consequences”. Others are taking a different approach, such as Keira Yin, 32, who set up a mutual defence group chat for Chatswood residents, in the north of Sydney, to “stand up together” and to “avoid sleazy men”. “The idea is that if something happens, people nearby can respond quickly and help each other.” Meanwhile, Neo Xia, 25, was allegedly attacked in Box Hill in Melbourne’s east in April. He said a teenager holding a machete allegedly attacked him, causing injuries to his hands and arm.Police confirmed a 14-year-old boy was arrested and charged over this incident for recklessly causing injury and unlawful assault, and bailed to appear in court at a later date. “I don’t really feel scared when it happened, more like angry,” Xia said. “I still feel a bit unsafe when I walk to the station … also, I feel particularly nervous when Australian teenagers approach me.” Community advocacy groups say racism is rising after a downturn after theheights of the pandemic. The Asian Australian Alliance says Covid-based abuse has morphed into being “more about people being told go back to China, or people being accused of being spies”. In a statement responding to the Eastgardens attack, Simon Chan, the Chinese Australian Forum president and a member of the Australian Multicultural Council, said rhetoric around Chinese spies by politicians degraded social cohesion. “Our political leaders should lead by example in maintaining … Australia as the best multicultural country in the world.” The six children charged in the alleged Eastgardens attack have been released on conditional bail and are scheduled to appear in children’s court in June. The NSW premier, Chris Minns, facedinternal dissentbeforeextending controversial youth bail lawsin late March, with one MP telling caucus the reforms had put the government on a “slippery slope”. On Tuesday, the chief justice of NSW put out a rare statement in the wake of criticism over decisions to grant bail rather than place alleged offenders in prison.He said the Bail Act aimed to strike a balance of dealing “with persons who have been charged with offences but who have not yet been found guilty of any crime” while also protecting the community. The NSW government recentlyannounced it was reviewinga centuries-old legal presumption that children aged 10 to 14 didn’t understand the difference between right and wrong.The criminal age of responsibility is 10, but doli incapax – Latin for “incapable of evil” – can apply up to 14. The presumption can be rebutted if police can prove a child understood what they did was seriously wrong as opposed to naughty.The review was criticised by youth advocates with Camilla Pandolfini, the CEO of Redfern Legal Centre, arguing the “state should focus on crime prevention and boost funding of Aboriginal community organisations and local services in rural and regional communities”. - Additional reporting by Jordyn Beazley",

    "title": "Presidential vote likely to determine Poland’s place on the EU stage",
    "article_text": "Poland’s presidential election runoff could have far-reaching implications for its place inEurope– either cementing the country’s hard-won seat at the EU’s top table, or heralding a return to altogether trickier times. The mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski, faces off against the historian Karol Nawrocki on Sundayin a neck-and-neck race, pitting a liberal vision of Poland at the heart of European policymaking against a nationalist, radical-right, EU-critical stance. Trzaskowski is backed by the Civic Platform coalition of the prime minister, Donald Tusk,which won parliamentary elections in 2023. Nawrocki is backed by the opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party, which was in power for the eight previous years. While in theory Polish presidents have limited influence over foreign policy, a win for Nawrocki, backed by PiS, would inevitably – and, eventually, significantly – constrain Poland’s European ambitions, analysts say. “We’re not so much talking direct policy consequences,” said Piotr Buras of the European Council on Foreign Relations thinktank. “But if Trzaskowski, Tusk’s candidate, loses, the message is that Poles reject him and his government.” Deprived of that legitimacy, Tusk “will struggle to play the big role in the EU he has started to play”, Buras said. “His government will be weaker, its room for manoeuvre will shrink. It’s about Poland’s capacity to play a strong role on the EU stage.” Tusk’s electoral victory two years ago marked the beginning of Poland’s return to the European fold after two fractious terms of populist national-conservative rule during which Warsawclashed repeatedly with Brusselsover rule of law concerns. PiS also regularly picked unnecessary fights with Germany, and in many EU debates sided with the illiberal Hungarian government of the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, the bloc’s disrupter-in-chief, further alienating Poland from the European mainstream. The return of Tusk, elected on a promise to undo most of the PiS-era reforms, led to a sea change in relations, with the EU rapidly unblocking more than €100bn of funds it had frozen in retaliation for Poland’s backsliding on democratic norms. Bolstered by a thriving economy, rising prosperity and its strategic importance in the resistance to Russia’s war on Ukraine, Warsaw has transformed itself in two short years into one of the EU’s most influential capitals, best buddies with Berlin and Paris. But its full return to the EU fold can be complete only if Tusk can deliver on those key reforms – in particular, rolling backPiS’s politicisation of the court system– that have so far been blocked by the outgoing PiS-aligned president, Andrzej Duda. Polish presidents have few executive powers. They serve as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, so can seek to shape security policy – and they have the power to veto legislation or refer it to a constitutional tribunal, effectively stalling it. That is a prerogative Duda has exercised on several occasions – and Nawrocki, who would seek to use his position to undermine Tusk at every turn before parliamentary elections in 2027, could be expected to be even more radical and confrontational. “A Nawrocki victory would put the stalemate that has existed between government and president since 2023 on a much more permanent footing,” said Nicolai von Ondarza of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP). Sign up toThis is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion “It would change the political calculation within Poland itself – and it would refocus European attention on the unfulfilled promises on rule-of-law that are actually the basis of Poland’s renewed relationship with the EU.” While EU leaders would be unlikely to turn the screw on Tusk (“The last thing they would want to do is weaken him further,” Von Ondarza said), the prime minister’s influence in key decisions, such as the bloc’s future budget, would inevitably wane. Nawrocki would back the PiS government’s approach of “building alternative EU alliances”, for example with Hungary and Slovakia, “as the most effective way of advancing Poland’s interests”,said Aleks Szczerbiakof the University of Sussex. Szczerbiak added that Nawrocki would certainly also prioritise maintaining close ties with the US, which he has said is Poland’s only credible security guarantor, and “oppose the development of a European defence capability outside Nato structures”. Buras agreed: “Nawrocki has been heavily critical of Tusk’s backing for Europe’s strategic security shift away from reliance on the US. He is a Trumpist; he was invited to the White House. There will be a constant tension there, around security policy.” Tensions between Tusk and Nawrocki would be exacerbated by splits that already exist within the prime minister’s disparate coalition of centrists, progressive leftists and conservatives, with policy over Ukraine already a victim of political divisions. There is broad consensus in Poland on the need to continue military aid to Ukraine. But Tusk himself has had to acknowledge public concern around the coalition of the willing, saying Poland would not participate, and over Ukraine’s EU membership. Nawrocki has gone further, tapping into Polish anti-Ukrainian sentiment over refugees and strongly criticising Kyiv and its EU and Nato accession plans. “As with migration and climate,” Von Ondarza said, “these issues are all more political.” But the big threat, concluded Buras, is long-term. “Nawrocki’s role would be to undermine Tusk, make it hard for him to govern, and pave the way for PiS in 2027,” he said. “That could be quite a realistic prospect – and a very big deal for Europe.”",

    "title": "Trump attacks judges who ruled against him on tariffs and praises ‘terrific’ Musk before Doge exit – as it happened",
    "article_text": "This blog has now closed. Read our latest storyhere ‘Trump always chickens out’: taco jibe ruffles president’s feathers After a relatively long (for him) period of silence on his social media platform following his huge loss at the US court for international trade on Wednesday, Donald Trump resumed posting through it on Thursday, witha 500-word screedattacking the three judges who ruled against him. Trump’s post began by noting that the order to unwind the tariffs had been paused temporarily by an appeals court, but then turned to baseless speculation that the three judges on the federal trade court must have been motivated by hatred for him. “Where do these initial three Judges come from? How is it possible for them to have potentially done such damage to the United States of America? Is it purely a hatred of ‘TRUMP?’ What other reason could it be?” the president asked, without noting that he had appointed one of the judges himself in 2018. Trump’s curiosity as to what could possibly explain the decision did not, apparently, extend to reading any ofthe 49-page explanationwritten by the court because he does not deal with any of the legal issues raised in the opinion in his post. Instead, Trump focuses on blaming the conservative activist Leonard Leo and the Federalist Society for recommending judges that have not allowed the president to break the law. “The ruling by the U.S. Court of International Trade is so wrong, and so political!” Trump wrote. “Hopefully, the Supreme Court will reverse this horrible, Country threatening decision, QUICKLY and DECISIVELY.” We are winding down our live coverage of the day in US politics, but will return on Friday to bring you up to the minute descriptions of a scheduled Trump-Musk press conference and other unscheduled events. In the meantime, here are a few of today’s leading developments: A federal appeals court granted the Trump administration’s request to keepDonald Trump’s tariffs in place, for now, one day after a trade court ruled that they are almost all illegal and must be stopped. Trump attacked the judges who ruled against him on Wednesday, including one he appointed himself, and suggested that he had been misled by a powerful Republican activist who recommended judges to him in his first term. Trump announced thatElon Muskis leaving the White House on Friday, but suggested that his work in “helping” the administration will continue. “This will be his last day, but not really, because he will, always, be with us, helping all the way”. Musk recently criticized the focus of Trump’s legislative agenda, the massive spending and tax cut bill that will increase the federal deficit by trillions. One day after the nonprofit news site NOTUSdiscoveredthat at least seven of the studies cited in a new report from health secretaryRobert F Kennedy’s “Make America Healthy Again” commission do not exist, the report was quietly edited to remove at least some of the fiction. One day after the nonprofit news site NOTUSdiscoveredthat at least seven of the studies cited in a new report from health secretary Robert F Kennedy’s “Make America Healthy Again” commission do not exist, the report was quietly edited to remove at least some of the fiction. One of the invented sources was a paper supposedly written by Dr. Katherine Keyes and published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics under the title “Changes in mental health and substance use among US adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic”. Keyes, who does exist, is an epidemiology professor at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, but sheconfirmed to ABC Newsthat no paper with that title was ever written by her. JAMA Pediatrics told the broadcaster that it had published no such paper. A search ofthe commission’s reporton Thursday shows that the reference to Keyes and the imaginary paper has been removed from the document. At least one other imaginary paper, supposedly published by the American Academy of Pediatrics, has also been removed from the report. “Minor citation and formatting errors have been corrected, but the substance of the MAHA report remains the same”, Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the health department told ABC News. Donald Trump announced on Thursday that Elon Musk is leaving the White House, but suggested that his work in “helping” the administration will continue. In a post on his social media platform, the president invited his fans to tune in on Friday foranotherOval Office press conference with Musk. “This will be his last day, but not really, because he will, always, be with us, helping all the way”,Trump wrote. “Elon is terrific!” he added. Musk’s departure marks the end of his tenure as aspecial government employee, a role that comes with a built-in time limit of no more than 130 days of government service during any period of 365 consecutive days. It also comes amid tensions over his public criticism of the massive spending bill Trump is trying to get through Congress. In an interview broadcast this week, Musktold David Pogueof CBS News that he was disappointed by the bill, which is projected to add nearly $4 trillion to the federal deficit, mainly through sweeping tax cuts for the rich. That spending, Musk said, undermines the work his so-called department of government efficiency has been doing to reduce federal spending. “I was like disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not decrease it, and undermines the work that the Doge team is doing,” Musk said. “I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful, but I don’t know if it can be both”. The budget-cutting and downsizing team Musk called the “department of government efficiency”, to invoke a meme, earned a reputation for making headline-grabbing claims about supposedly wasteful spending it had discovered, almost all of which proved to be eitherwildly exaggeratedorsimply untrue. Although the administration says that the effort to radically shrink the government will continue without Musk, one member of the team, software engineer Sahil Lavingia,told Reuterson Thursday that it will more likely “fizzle out” and “die wih a whimper” once Musk leaves. “So much of the appeal and allure was Elon.” Lavingia said he expected Doge staffers to “just stop showing up to work. It’s like kids joining a startup that will go out of business in four months”. Lavingia, whoblogged aboutbeing fired from the team after 55 days for talking to the media, said that he was given close to no guidance when he was sent to work at the Department of Veterans Affairs. “I got dropped into the VA with an HP laptop. What are we supposed to do? What is the road map?” Lavingia said he asked, to no avail. “I felt like I was being pranked.” After a relatively long (for him) period of silence on his social media platform following his huge loss at the US court for international trade on Wednesday, Donald Trump resumed posting through it on Thursday, witha 500-word screedattacking the three judges who ruled against him. Trump’s post began by noting that the order to unwind the tariffs had been paused temporarily by an appeals court, but then turned to baseless speculation that the three judges on the federal trade court must have been motivated by hatred for him. “Where do these initial three Judges come from?

The Hatch Act, a law that forbids executive branch employees from taking part in political activities while engaged in their official duties, is rarely enforced, but the ethics agencydeterminedin 2019 that Trump’s adviser Kellyanne Conway had “repeatedly violated” the law by making political statements as a White House official and urged the president to fire her. Trump did not act on that recommendation, but one of his first acts when he returned to power was to fire the special counsel, Hampton Dellinger. By law, Dellinger, who was confirmed by the Senate in 2024, was supposed to serve a five-year term and could only be “removed by the president only for inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office”. Dellinger was fired by email on 7 February without any indication as to why. He fought the dismissal in court, but ultimately dropped his suit after an appeals court cleared the way for Trump to remove him. Ingrassia, a far-right lawyer and writer, has been the White House Liaison for Homeland Security since February. Before that, as the White House Liaison for the Department of Justice, Ingrassia when he went to the D.C. jail in Washington on the first day of Trump’s second term to welcome pardoned Trump supporters who had been convicted of crimes for their part in the January 6 riot. According tohis LinkedIn account, Ingrassia, who obtained a law degree from Cornell between stints as a writer for the Daily Caller and the Gateway Pundit blog, has twice been a fellow at the ultraconservative Claremont Institute think tank. Ingrassia has claimed to be Trump’s favorite writer, and, as CNN reported, hepublishedadiscredited theoryduring the 2024 Republican primary claiming that Nikki Haley was not eligible to be president because her parents were not yet US citizens when she was born in South Carolina. Ingrassia’s false claim, which was featured on Gateway Pundit, andshared by Trump, built on the spurious reasoning of another former Claremont fellow, John Eastman, whotried to argue in 2020that Kamala Harris was not born a citizen in California because her parents were not citizens at the time. CNN also reported that a the Twitter feed of a podcast Ingrassia co-hosted with his sister in 2020called for“secession” if Trump’s legal challenges to the election he lost failed and evenurged Trump“to declare martial law” to remain in office. A pregnant mother from Africa who has been waiting for her asylum claim to be heard since last year was detained by immigration officials in Washington state in a windowless cell for 24 days, along with her partner and the couple’s four children, the Washington branch of the American Civil Liberties Uniontold Oregon Public Broadcasting. The family had been living in Seattle while their asylum claim was processed but decided last month to cross from Blaine, Washington, into Canada, as the Trump administration’s crackdown on undocumented immigrants ramped up. They were taken into custody by immigration officials and held in a single room in the Blaine Border Patrol Station from 26 April 26 to 20 May. “They were detained because they were attempting to leave the country, which is what they thought the government wanted from them” David Montes, an ACLU Washington staff attorney, told OPB. The six-person family had to share a single open toilet in the room. The mother, who is diabetic, is still breastfeeding her youngest child: an 11-month-old who was born in Washington state and is a US citizen under the birthright citizenship provision of the US constitutionDonald Trumpis trying to cancel. “They had no ability to contest that they were being detained”, Angelina Godoy, of the University of Washington’s Center for Human Rights, told OPB. “They were just held — essentially kidnapped — and released by the government when they decided to do so.” A border patrol spokesperson told the broadcaster the agency generally tries to process people it detains within three days. According to Reuters, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett just told reporters that he expects some trade deals to be struck in the next week or two, and that he has been briefed on three such deals that were “about to happen”. Hassett, the news agency notes, “declined to identify which countries might be involved”. Earlier on Thursday, Hassettassured Fox Businessthat trade deals were imminent. “I saw, last week at the end of the week, three that were basically ready for the president’s decision” Hassett told Mario Bartiromo, one of Trump’s favorite hosts. “I don’t know if people have had that conversation with him yet, but yes, there are many, many deals coming and there are three that are, basically look like they’re done”. But while Hassett’s statements continue to be treated as news, it is difficult to know how seriously to take his claims, given that it has now beenexactly two weeks sincehe told the conservative talk radio hostAndrew Wilkow: “We’ve got 24, 25 more deals that we’ll announce probably over the next two weeks.” It is of course possible that Hassett will be proven right, this time, but another possibility is that the president’s economic advisor has adopted Trump’s favorite dodge of telling reporters that some sort of breakthrough is always just two weeks away. AsBloomberg News reportedin 2017, Trump insisted early in his first term that a range of problems were about to be solved in “two weeks”. That March, for instance, Trump promised Tucker Carlson that his claim to have been wiretapped by the Obama administration was about to be proven correct. “I think you’re going to find some very interesting items coming to the forefront over the next two weeks”, he said. In early April 2017, Trump said: “We’re going to make an announcement in two weeks” on an infrastructure package. When no such package had materialized three weeks later, Trump said: “We’ve got the plan largely completed and we’ll be filing over the next two or three weeks”. The sweeping upgrade to US infrastructure did not arrive until Joe Biden was president. In June of 2017, Bloomberg noted that it had been “15 weeks since Trump promised an aviation infrastructure proposal in two weeks”. Eight years later, Trump’s latest transportation secretary is currently promising to solve that same problem. In the summer of 2020, as he ran for reelection during the pandemic, Trumptold Fox Newsthat he was about to make good on his promise to replace Obamacare and reform the nation’s immigration system. “We’re signing a health care plan within two weeks, a full and complete health care plan”, Trump said. “The decision by the Supreme Court on DACA allows me to do things on immigration, on health care, on other things that we’ve never done before. And you’re going to find it to be a very exciting two weeks”, he added. No such plans were ever signed. The pattern has continued into Trump’s second term. “Do you trust President Putin?” Trump was asked by a reporterlast month. “I’ll let you know in about two weeks,” he replied. Pressed to elaborate on what he expected to happen in two weeks, Trump evaded the question. “Two weeks or less,” he said. Five weeks later, when Trumpwas askedyesterday if the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, actually wants to end the war in Ukraine, he replied: “I can’t tell you that, but I’ll let you know in about two weeks, within two weeks”. “It’ll take about a week and a half, two weeks” Trump said. “That is the classic Donald Trump ‘two week’ response to a question about a deadline or a timeline”, the ABC News correspondent Karen Traverstold viewers. “We’ve heard this from him before when it comes to the Russia-Ukraine negotiations. He already put a two week deadline on that for the two sides to reach a peace agreement. That deadline came and went”. In his remarks to reporters a few minutes ago, Trump’s chief trade adviserPeter Navarrotried hard to cast the legal challenges to the retaliatory and trafficking tariffs imposed unilaterally by the president as both political and illegitimate. To that end, Navarro urged reporters to report his false claims that the 12 states that filed suit were all Democratic states representing coastal elites, and that the five importers that told the court the new import taxes posed a grave threat to their businesses all sold “crap from China”. “A detail that you should put on your stories: I mean, how did this suit come about? Twelve states of this union sued and every single one of them is a blue state, from the left coast of Oregon and Washington to New York and Connecticut on the elitist coast”, Navarro said, wrongly. In fact, Washington was not a party to the suit, while Arizona and Nevada, states that both voted for Trump in the 2024 election and are not on either coast, were parties to the suit. Colorado, Illinois and Minnesota, which joined the suit, are also not coastal states. “The other parties to the suit were a bunch of importers who buy a bunch of cheap, subsidized crap from China”, Navarro added, also incorrectly. The five owner-operated businesses that suedare:VOS Selections, a wine importer;FishUSA, Inc, which sells sportfishing tackle and related gear, from Canada, South Korea and Kenya, as well as China;Genova Pipe, which manufactures ABS pipe in the US using imported resin from South Korea and Taiwan;MicroKits LLC, which makes educational electronic kits and musical instruments in the US using imported components; andTerry Precision Cycling, which specializes in women’s cycling apparel. Speaking to the media outside the White House, Trump’s chief trade adviserPeter Navarrosaid the administration “will respond forcefully” to the US trade court’s ruling on Trump’s tariff agenda and plans to “fight this all the way up the chain”. The administration would seek to enact tariffs through other means if it ultimately loses the court fights over its trade policy, Navarro continued. You can assume even if we lose, we will do it another way. He said the tariffs would remain in place for now followinga court stayand that the administration is still in talks with other countries to continue trade negotiations. On the federal appeals court’s ruling on Thursday that Trump’s tariffs can stay in place, for now,Raffi Melkonian, a federal appellate lawyer based in Houston,explainson social media that the temporary administrative stay of the order blocking the tariffs from the US court of international trade “does *not* mean the Court will block the order for the entire appeal”. The text ofthe appeals court’s ordersays this: “The request for an immediate administrative stay is granted to the extent that the judgments and the permanent injunctions entered by the Court of International Trade in these cases are temporarily stayed until further notice while this court considers the motions papers.” Of the 11 judges who approved the temporary stay, allowing Trump’s dozens of retaliatory and trafficking tariffs to remain in place, three were appointed by Republican presidents – one byGeorge H.W. Bushand two byGeorge W. Bush– and the other eight by Democratic presidents – one byBill Clinton, five byBarack Obamaand two byJoe Biden. An appeals court hasagreedthat Trump’s tariffs could remain in place pending an appeal hearing by the Trump administration. A US trade court ruled yesterday that the tariff regime was illegal in a dramatic twist that could block Trump’s controversial global trade policy. If the administration loses the appeal, it is expected to take the caseto the supreme court.",

    "title": "Woman’s life-saving treatment delayed by Trump cuts to NIH: ‘Cancer shouldn’t be political’",
    "article_text": "A 43-year-old woman and mother of two with advanced cancer says she is experiencing life-or-death delays in treatment because of the Trump administration’s cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Natalie Phelps, who has stage 4 colorectal cancer, has spoken publicly, raising the alarm about a setback in care for herself and others who are part of clinical trials run by the agency. Her story has made it into congressional hearings and spurred a spat between a Democratic senator and the US health secretary,Robert F Kennedy Jr. Behind the scenes, she and others are advocating to get her treatment started sooner. So far, Phelps has been told that her treatment, which should have started around mid-June, will not begin until after mid-July. “I’ve done everything I can do,” Phelps, who lives in Washington state, told the Guardian. “There’s nothing else I can do. I’m really just out of options. There’s very limited treatments approved for colorectal cancer.” Phelps is one of many Americans whose lives have been disrupted or altered by the ongoing cuts to government services made by the Trump administration’s so-called “department of government efficiency”, or Doge. Some NIH scientists have lost their jobs, and others have seen their grants ended. Researcherstold the Associated Pressthat cuts to the agency and its programs would end treatment for cancer patients and delay cures and treatment discoveries. Phelps was diagnosed in 2020, soon after giving birth to her second child, and after her symptomswere dismissedby doctors for months. Since then, she’s gone through 48 rounds of chemotherapy. She had an 18-hour surgery to remove her primary tumor, plus two follow-up liver surgeries. She’s had radiation therapy to her brain, leg and pelvis. Dr Steven Rosenberg’s cell-based immunotherapy trial at the NIH offered hope. The treatment uses a person’s own cells to fight cancer and has seen some promise for patients with colon, rectal and GI cancers. This was deemed an exciting step by the medical community because the process had previously worked on blood cancers, but not solid cancers, theWashington Post reported. But these promising developments are coming alongside cuts to federal agencies, including ones that have affected these trials, Rosenberg has publicly confirmed. The trial itself was not cut, but it is experiencing delays because of staff reductions,Rosenberg has said. Phelps passed the initial medical steps to enter the trial in March, then flew to Bethesda, Maryland, at the end of April this year. There, they drew her blood to use to engineer T-cells for her treatment, which she previously was told takes about four weeks. Instead, she was told it would now take eight weeks, which the doctors said was because of funding cuts imposed by Doge. “That got me motivated enough to start to really panic, because my cancer between March and April really exploded and progressed to my lymph nodes and my bones,” she said. “My oncologist was very anxious about the difference between four and eight weeks could make, waiting for those treatment products.” One month can make a huge difference in late-stage cancer treatment, but the delay also brought up major decisions for Phelps. She wouldn’t be able to do chemo for a month before the treatment began. With a delay, she could maybe do chemo for a bit, then stop a month before. Then there was the size of her tumors – which would become the subject of the spat in a congressional hearing. She needed a tumor of at least one centimeter in size to start the trial, or an exemption – her disease was spreading in the number of tumors, not in one large tumor. The tumor would help scientists track how the treatment was working. If she underwent chemo before doing a final scan needed to start the trial, tumors could shrink, affecting her eligibility. But if she waited for two months and did nothing, the disease could keep spreading. Her oncologist thought maybe the trial would have to be placed on the back burner, given the extended timeline. Phelps posted on social media, explaining her predicament. After seeing her videos, friends suggested she reach out to her members of Congress, who could intervene with the agency and help her get treated sooner. The office of Patty Murray, a Washington Democratic senator, got involved. On 14 May, Murray questioned Kennedy during a Senate health, education, labor and pensions committeehearing, sharing Phelps’ story and asking how many staff have been cut from the NIH’s clinical center. Kennedy said to reach out to his office for specifics on Phelps and claimed no cuts had been made to clinical trials. “I don’t think that should happen to anybody,” he said. Later in the hearing, though, Kennedy said his office had looked into the case and claimed that Phelps was “medically ineligible” for the trial, so her case had nothing to do with staff reductions. “That was a canard,” he told the committee, and he told Murray: “You don’t care. You don’t care about Natalie.” The exchangebecamea Fox News headline. It was a “spurious statement” to say she was medically ineligible, Phelps said – she was waiting for one final scan to see if her tumor was one centimeter, but had met all other criteria. She had a scan the day after the hearing, which showed her tumor had now grown large enough to qualify. “It’s been so much extra stress. The night after the hearing, I threw up all night. I barely made it to my scan because I was so stressed out,” she said. “It’s been very intense emotionally and an extreme added stress that nobody needs.Cancerjust shouldn’t be political.” In a Senate appropriations hearingthe next week, Kennedy again argued with Murray, saying it was “untrue” that Phelps’ care was delayed. In statements after the second exchange, Murray said her staff has been in “constant touch” with career staff at the NIH and the FDA to get help on Phelps’ case. “I still have no answer about how many NIH clinical staff have been fired,” Murray’s 20 May statement says. “I still have no answer why Natalie was told by her NIH doctor that her care was being delayed due to staffing cuts. For weeks, my staff has been demanding answers about agency staffing cuts.” In a statement, a spokesperson for the Department ofHealthand Human Services (HHS) said cancer research is a “high priority” for the NIH and HHS. “Ongoing investments reflect our dedication to addressing both urgent and long-term health challenges,” the agency said. “There have been no cuts to clinical trials.” In another statement sent after publication, the agency said the claim that patients were seeing treatment delays because of reductions in force was “false”. “No clinical trials have been cut. No personnel involved in direct patient care were affected by the RIF,” the agency said. “Clinical trials continue to be conducted in accordance with established protocols and patient safety standards. NIH investigators are responsible for ensuring trials are appropriately staffed, that patient enrollment aligns with trial capacity, and that participants are fully informed of timelines and potential risks of experimental treatments. We do not comment on individual patient cases in accordance with the Privacy Act and to protect patient confidentiality.” But Rosenberg, the doctor leading the trial Phelps is in,confirmed to the Washington Postin April that two patients were delayed care because of staff cuts and “purchasing slowdowns”, and these delays were confirmed before big layoffs hit the agency. Rosenberg didn’t respond to requests for comment this week. He previously toldthe Cancer Letter, an oncology publication, that Phelps was, at the time of the hearing, not eligible because of her tumors’ size, but was scheduled for additional scans to see if they had grown. He confirmed that, if determined eligible, her case would be delayed by a month because of reductions in force. Phelps wasn’t alone, he told the publication – nearly all of the trial patients were seeing a delay of about a month, which he attributed to a “loss of technicians” as part of reductions in force done by the Trump administration. It isn’t just delays, either. “We’ve had to drop the number of pa­tients we treat by about half. We’re just having to turn away more patients,” Rosenberg said. Phelps is still waiting to hear when she can start treatment. As of last Thursday, she was told she had a spot in the queue and the agency was seeing if her treatment could be moved up. On Tuesday, she was told it would now be 21 July. The NIH told her the agency tried to hire back staff, but it hasn’t worked out. “I have nothing to lose at this point. I’m pleading for my life. I’m begging for help,” she said.",

    "title": "Climate activist Greta Thunberg to join aid ship effort to break Gaza siege",
    "article_text": "Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg and Game of Thrones actor Liam Cunningham will join the next sailing of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition (FFC) as it attempts to break Israel’s months-long blockade of Gaza. The “Madleen” is due to disembark from Catania, Sicily, on Sunday with a cargo of humanitarian aid and several high-profile activists on board, including Thunberg, European Member of Parliament Rima Hassan and Palestinian-American lawyer Huwaida Arraf. Cunningham, an Irish actor best known for his role as Davos Seaworth in the hit HBO series, is a longtime advocate for Palestine and similar causes. The sailing marks the second attempt in as many months by the FFC, a coalition of humanitarian groups, to reach Gaza. A mission at the start of May was aborted after another FFC vessel, the “Conscience”, was attacked by two alleged drones while sailing in international waters off the coast of Malta. The FFC alleges that Israel was responsible for the attack, which severely damaged the front section of the ship. Meet some of the panelists, volunteers and supporters joining the launch of ‘Madleen’ in Catania, Sicily about to sail to break Israel's illegal siege of Gaza. ⛵️#AllEyesOnDeck#BreakTheSiegehttps://t.co/ZoCnr45S3I@RimaHaspic.twitter.com/IqAhOSHBv9 — Freedom Flotilla Coalition (@GazaFFlotilla)May 29, 2025 MEP Hassan said in a short video on social media that the trip by the “Madleen” is a protest against Israel as much as an attempt to deliver much-needed aid to Gaza. “The first [goal] being of course to reject the blockade of humanitarian aid, the ongoing genocide, the impunity enjoyed by the State of Israel and to raise global international awareness,” she said. “This action is also in response to the attack that took place on May 2 against the previous ship that took place in international waters near Malta.” Israel partially lifted its nearly three-month blockade of Gaza last week, but since then has only allowed a tiny amount of assistance into the Palestinian territory, which the United States has warned is on the brink of famine. This week, thousands of Palestinians rushed to so-called aid distribution stations set up by the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, leading to the deaths of at least three people and dozens of injuries in the chaos that ensued as desperate people tried to get food supplies. The UN and other humanitarian organisations are boycotting the US and Israeli-backed initiative, accusing Israel of attempting to consolidate and control aid distribution across Gaza in a further weaponisation of food and starvation. The World Health Organization has warned that Gaza is at risk of famine following months of prolonged food shortages amid Israel’s punishing blockade, and that about a quarter of the population is in a “catastrophic situation of hunger, acute malnutrition, starvation, illness and death”.",

    "title": "Musk says 50-50 chance of sending uncrewed Starship to Mars by late 2026",
    "article_text": "Elon Musk has said that he believes there is a 50 percent chance that his Mars spacecraft will make its first uncrewed voyage to the red planet at the end of 2026, just two days after the latest test-flight setback for his SpaceX firm. Musk presented a detailed Starship development timeline in a video posted online by his Los Angeles area-based rocket company on Thursday. The South African-born billionaire and SpaceX owner said his latest timeline for reaching Mars depended on whether the craft can complete several challenging technical feats during testing, specifically a post-launch refuelling manoeuvre in Earth’s orbit. In a video on social media platform X, which he also owns, Musk said his Starbase industrial complex and rocket launch facility in Texas was the “gateway to Mars”. “It is where we are going to develop the technology necessary to take humanity and civilisation and life as we know it to another planet for the first time in the four and a half billion year history of Earth,” he said. The end of 2026 is when a slim window opens offering the closest trip between Earth and Mars, as the planets align around the sun once every two years. This shorter distance would take seven to nine months to transit by spacecraft. The first flight to Mars would carry a simulated crew consisting of Tesla-built humanoid Optimus robots. Human crews would then follow in the second or third landings. In the video, Musk said he believed there was a 50-50 chance SpaceX would meet the 2026 deadline for the first mission. He added that if Starship was not ready by that time, SpaceX would wait another two years before trying again. Musk’s announcement comes just a day after he confirmed his departure from the administration of United States President Donald Trump, following a tumultuous few months in which his various businesses – including SpaceX and electric car maker Tesla – have come under growing strain. Musk’s unofficial role leading Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has placed him in the crosshairs, as he has faced intense criticism for overseeing what has been decried as haphazard cuts to government programmes. Faced with plunging stock prices and shareholder concern – most notably at Tesla – Musk said this week he would scale back his government role to focus on his private ventures. In 2016, Musk said he wanted to send an uncrewed SpaceX vehicle to Mars as early as 2018, while he was targeting 2024 to launch the first crewed mission there. But the mercurial entrepreneur’s ambitions for interplanetary exploration have been beset by repeated setbacks over recent years. Most recently, on Tuesday, Musk was due to deliver a live webcast from the company’s Starbase in Texas following a ninth test flight of Starship that evening. But the speech was cancelled without notice after Starshipspun out of control and disintegratedabout 30 minutes after launch, roughly halfway through its flight path, failing to achieve some of its most important test goals. The mega-rocket re-entered the Earth’s atmosphere earlier than planned on Wednesday after a fuel leak triggered uncontrollable spinning in space, according to the Reuters news agency. Posting on X after the failed flight, Musk said the test produced a lot of “good data to review” as he promised a faster launch “cadence” for the next several attempts. There was also a failed launch inJanuary– when the craft blew up moments after liftoff, raining debris over parts of the Caribbean and forcing commercial jetliners to change course – as well as inMarch. Musk, who has spent billions of dollars on Starship’s development, says the initiative is part of SpaceX’s plan to colonise Mars. The firm is also working with US government agency NASA to return humans to the Moon in 2027 onboard Starship, more than half a century since astronauts last walked on the lunar surface in 1972. These efforts are a stepping stone towards launching NASA astronauts to Mars sometime in the 2030s.",

    "article_text": "Drug cartel members are suspected of murdering five Mexican band members, who went missing after being hired to perform a concert in a crime-ridden city in the northeast of the country. The Diario de Mexico newspaper said on Thursday that the bodies of the five musicians had been discovered after they went missing on Sunday, and nine suspects were arrested in connection with their abduction and killing. According to authorities, the nine suspects are part of the “Los Metros” faction of the Gulf Cartel, which operates in the city of Reynosa, in Tamaulipas state, near the United States border. “Law enforcement arrested nine individuals considered likely responsible for the events. They are known to be members of a criminal cell of the Gulf Cartel,” Tamaulipas Attorney General Irving Barrios told a news conference. Tamaulipas is considered one of Mexico’s most dangerous states due to the presence of cartel members involved in drug and migrant trafficking, as well as other crimes, including extortion. The announcement of the arrests came hours after officials said five bodies had been found in the search for the men, who were members of a local band called Fugitivo. The musicians were hired to put on a concert on Sunday but arrived to find that the location of their proposed performance was a vacant lot, according to family members who had held a protest urging the authorities to act. Relatives had reported receiving ransom demands for the musicians, who were aged between 20 and 40 years old. Mexican musicians have been targeted previously by cartel members amid rivalry, as some receive payment to compose and perform songs that glorify the exploits of gang leaders. Investigators used video surveillance footage and mobile phone tracking to establish the musicians’ last movements, Barrios said. Nine firearms and two vehicles were seized, he said. More than 480,000 people have been killed in drug-related violence and organised crime, and about 120,000 people have gone missing, in Mexico.",

    "title": "Hamas says US ceasefire proposal means ‘continuation of killing’ in Gaza",
    "article_text": "A ceasefire proposal with Israel tabled by the administration of United States President Donald Trump is “still under discussion” by Hamas, but in its current form will only result in “the continuation ofkilling and famine” in Gaza, an official from the Palestinian group has said. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Thursday that Israel had “signed off” on the ceasefire proposal, and the Trump administration’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, had submitted it to Hamas for consideration. Hamas political bureau member Basem Naim told the Reuters news agency that the deal “does not meet any of our people’s demands, foremost among them, halting the war”. “Nonetheless, the movement’s leadership is studying the response to the proposal with full national responsibility,” Naim added. Hamas will respond on Friday or Saturday, a source from the Palestinian group told Reuters. The details of the new proposal have not been made public, but senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters that, crucially, it did not contain commitments from Israel to end its war on Gaza, withdraw Israeli troops from the enclave, or allow aid to freelyenter the war-torn territory. Citing a draft copy, Reuters said the proposal outlined an initial 60-day ceasefire. Twenty-eight Israeli hostages, alive and dead, would be released in the first week in exchange for the release of 125 Palestinian prisoners and the remains of 180 dead Palestinians. The plan, reportedly guaranteed by President Trump and mediators Egypt and Qatar, would also see aid sent to Gaza as soon as Hamas signs. The Israeli government has not publicly confirmed that it approved the latest proposal. Reports in Israeli media this week suggested that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the families of captives still held in Gaza that he is prepared to move forward with Witkoff’s temporary ceasefire proposal. Akiva Eldar, an Israeli political analyst, told Al Jazeera it was “unusual” for Israel to come out and agree to a proposal first, and that Netanyahu may be betting on the plan being impossible for Hamas to accept so that he can paint them as the “bad guys” and continue the war. “It happened before… and Netanyahu put the blame on them,” Eldar said. Attempts to restore a ceasefire in Gaza have been scuppered by deep differences on conditions for ending the conflict, including Israel’s demand that Hamas completely disarm, and the Palestinian group’s demand that Israeli forces withdraw from Gaza. Reports of this latest proposal follow conflicting reports earlier this week, when Hamas claimed it had reached an understanding for a ceasefire “general framework” with Witkoff and only awaited a “final response”. “We have reached an agreement on a general framework with Witkoff that ensures a permanent ceasefire, a complete withdrawal of Israeli occupation forces from Gaza, and the unhindered entry of humanitarian aid,” the group said in a statement. The agreement also reportedly included “the establishment of a professional committee to manage Gaza’s affairs once a ceasefire is declared”, according to the Hamas statement. As part of the deal, Trump would also reportedly guarantee that a ceasefire would be established within 60 days and ensure the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. Witkoff, however, later denied that these were the terms of any deal he had proposed, telling Reuters that what he had seen was “completely unacceptable”. An anonymous US official close to Witkoff also rejected the claim, telling Al Jazeera that the group’s claims were “inaccurate” and “disappointing”. Israel also dismissed the claim, with one unnamed official calling the statement “psychological warfare” and “propaganda” in comments to The Times of Israel. Israel resumed its war on Gaza on March 18, after breaking a six-week temporary ceasefire, with Netanyahu announcing that fighting had resumed with “full force”. The months since have seen the Israeli military resume its relentless assault across Gaza, killing close to 4,000 people since breaking the truce and propelling the overall death toll in the enclave to more than 54,000, according to health authorities in Gaza. Israel has also imposed a deadly, months-long blockade on humanitarian aid entering the Palestinian enclave, which UN officials say has pushed the population to thebrink of famine. Israelpartially liftedits blockade on May 19, allowing a trickle of aid to enter Gaza, but United States Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described it as a mere “teaspoon” of what is needed. There werechaotic scenes this weekas crowds of starving Palestinians attempted to reach life-saving supplies distributed by the US- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation – a new and controversial group that said it would deliver aid in the besieged enclave.",

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 29, 2025 / 11:57 PM EDT/ CBS/AP Bernard Kerik, an ally of President Trump who served as the commissioner of the New York City Police Department during the 9/11 terror attacks, died Thursday at the age of 69. Kerik, who joined the NYPD in 1986, served as the department's 40th commissioner from 2000 to 2001 under former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. \"For nearly two decades, Kerik served and protected New Yorkers in the NYPD, including helping rebuild the city in the aftermath of 9/11. We offer our deepest condolences to his family and loved ones,\" the NYPD wrote on social media. In 2003, Kerik served in President George W. Bush's administration as the head of a provisional police force in Iraq. \"It was just this afternoon that I stopped by the hospital to see Bernie Kerik, my friend of nearly 30 years, before his passing. He was with his loved ones who are in my prayers tonight. He was a great New Yorker and American. Rest in peace, my friend,\" New York City Mayor Mayor Eric Adams said in a statement. Kerik, an Army veteran, rose to the pinnacle of law enforcement before a fall so steep that even a city jail named after him was renamed. In 2009,he pleaded guiltyto federal tax fraud and false statement charges, partially stemming from over $250,000 in apartment renovations he received from a construction firm that authorities say counted on Kerik to convince New York officials it had no organized crime links. He served three years in prison before his release in 2013. President Trumppardoned Kerikduring a 2020 clemency blitz. Kerik was among the guests feting Mr. Trump after his first appearance in federal court in Florida in a case related to his handling of classified documents, attending the former president's remarks at his Bedminster, New Jersey, club. Kerik was appointed by Giuliani to serve as police commissioner in 2000 and was in the position during the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Kerik caught the Bush administration off guard when he abruptly withdrew his nomination to run the Department of Homeland Security in 2004. At the time he said he had uncovered information that led him to question the immigration status of a person he employed as a housekeeper and nanny. The sprawling homeland security bureaucracy, created by Bush in the aftermath of 9/11, oversees the federal agencies responsible for enforcement of the nation's immigration laws, among many others. In 2005, Kerik founded the Kerik Group, a crisis and risk management consulting firm. He later worked for the former mayor of New York Citysurrounding the effortsto overturn Mr. Trump's 2020 loss. FBI Director Kash Patel described Kerik in a post on social media as \"a warrior, a patriot, and one of the most courageous public servants this country has ever known.\" \"He was decorated more than 100 times for bravery, valor, and service, having rescued victims from burning buildings, survived assassination attempts, and brought some of the world's most dangerous criminals to justice,\" he said. \"His legacy is not just in the medals or the titles, but in the lives he saved, the city he helped rebuild, and the country he served with honor.\" © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

The ruling, which was paused by anappellate court, put Mr. Trump at odds with some conservative lawyers: Two of the three judges who decided the case were appointed by Republicans, and the decision came in response to a lawsuit that cited right-leaning legal theories. The president attacked the three judges behind that ruling in a Truth Social post late Thursday, calling it a \"horrible, Country threatening decision\" and suggesting it was made because the judges hate him. He then turned his attention to Leo and the Federalist Society, two longstanding pillars of the conservative legal movement widely credited with helping Mr. Trump pickhundreds of federal judges— some of whom have ruled against his administration. \"I was new to Washington, and it was suggested that I use The Federalist Society as a recommending source on Judges,\" Mr. Trump wrote onTruth Sociallate Thursday. \"I did so, openly and freely, but then realized that they were under the thumb of a real \"sleazebag\" named Leonard Leo, a bad person who, in his own way, probably hates America, and obviously has his own separate ambitions.\" In astatement to Politico, Leo said: \"I'm very grateful for President Trump transforming the Federal Courts, and it was a privilege being involved,\" Leo said. \"There's more work to be done, for sure, but the Federal Judiciary is better than it's ever been in modern history, and that will be President Trump's most important legacy.\" CBS News has reached out to Leo and the Federalist Society for comment. Mr. Trump's attacks on Leo and the Federalist Society are striking because of their years-long alliance with the president. During his 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump promised to listen to the right-leaning legal organization when making judicial picks,saying in an interview: \"We're going to have great judges, conservative, all picked by the Federalist Society.\" During Mr. Trump's first term, Leo advised the president on his Supreme Court picks, who form a key part of the high court's 6-3 conservative majority. Leo spoke with Mr. Trump shortly after Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement in 2018, opening up a vacancy on the court that was filled by Brett Kavanaugh, Leotold CBS Newsat the time. When asked how Mr. Trump decided to create a list of possible high court nominees, Leo said the president \"called and asked to meet and suggested the idea of doing a list.\" Mr. Trump spoke positively about Leo in his first term. \"We had a list that you worked on very hard, and others,\" the president said in a2019 event. But on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he's \"disappointed in The Federalist Society because of the bad advice they gave me on numerous Judicial Nominations.\" Mr. Trump also noted Leo has \"left The Federalist Society to do his own 'thing,'\" possibly referring to Leo's work with the Teneo Network, a group intended to — inLeo's words— \"crush liberal dominance\" in fields other than law, from entertainment to finance. The president has clashed with judges repeatedly in recent months, as parts of his agenda — including tariffs and immigration policy — face pushback from the federal judiciary. In particular, tariffs could pit one of Mr. Trump'ssignature economic policiesagainst some of the legal theories championed by the conservative judicial movement. Lawsuits arguing Mr. Trump doesn't have the power to levy sweeping global tariffs have cited the nondelegation doctrine and the major questions doctrine, two legal concepts that right-leaning members of the Supreme Court — including ones chosen by Mr. Trump — have embraced for years.

Shawon Shamarion Williams, 19, was arrested by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, or NCIS, and was booked into the Lake County Jail north of Chicago. The Navy sailor is assigned to Naval Station Great Lakes near North Chicago. Cellphone video shows the chaotic shooting scene from Memorial Day weekend. Ten people were shot as they got off a boat in Little River, South Carolina — a community near the North Carolina state line. Williams was taken into custody Thursday afternoon in Lake County, Illinois, Cmdr. Jessica L. McNulty, U.S. Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery spokeswoman, confirmed. Williams was a hull maintenance technician seaman, assigned to Navy Medicine Readiness and Training Command Great Lakes, McNulty said. NCIS transferred custody of Williams to local authorities, McNulty said. Police in South Carolina said Williams is expected to be charged with multiple counts of attempted murder and possession of a weapon during a violent crime. More people could be arrested in the case, police added. \"We got shot coming off the boat,\" shooting victim Jeremy Evans said. \"We were on the pier.\" Evans was shot in the leg. He posted video of his recovery, and responded to the arrest Thursday by calling for justice. \"When I got hit, I took my shorts off and wrapped it around my wound,\" said Evans. \"We were involved in a mass shooting. Ten of us got sprayed on this deck.\" Police said a private charter boat had just docked when a quarrel led to the shooting. \"He started shooting and running backwards,\" Evans said. Williams was booked in the Lake County Jail on a fugitive of justice charge. He will appear in court Friday morning, where the extradition process is expected to begin.

Faizan, a 13-year-old from Allen, Texas, was a favorite to win this year's Scripps National Spelling Bee and waslast year's runner-up. In its final minutes, the competition came down to Sarv Dharavane, 11; Sarvadnya Kadam, 14; and Faizan. However, all three finalists misspelled their respective words, which set up another round between the three. \"I can't remember the last time we've seen this kind of late-round drama here at the spelling bee,\" said Paul Loeffler, the Bee's TV analyst. Following another round, the last two standing were Sarvadnya and Faizan, who won the Bee by correctly spelling éclaircissement, which is anoun that's definedas a \"clearing up of something obscure.\" Faizan was able to spell the word correctly without asking a single question. He pumped his fists and collapsed to the floor after finishing the last few letters of the word with excitement in his voice. \"I'm really happy,\" Faizan said afterward. The first National Spelling Bee began 100 years ago in 1925. However, Thursday's winner marked the 110th champion due to aneight-way tie in 2019and a two-way tie several times. Nine students, ages 11 to 14, faced off Thursday on the final night of the Scripps National Spelling Bee.

    "title": "Alaska man unscathed after being pinned for hours by 700-pound boulder",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 29, 2025 / 10:52 PM EDT/ CBS/AP An Alaska man who was pinned facedown in an icy creek by a 700-pound boulder for three hours survived the ordeal with only minor injuries, thanks in part to his wife's quick thinking and lots of luck. Kell Morris' wife held his head above water to prevent him from drowning while waiting for rescuers to arrive after Morris was pinned by the boulder, which crashed onto him during a hike near a remote glacier south of Anchorage. His second stroke of luck came when a sled dog tourism company that operates on the glacier overheard the 911 dispatch and offered up its helicopter to ferry rescuers to the scene, which was inaccessible to all-terrain vehicles. Once rescuers arrived, it took seven men and inflatable airbags to lift the boulder off as he drifted in and out of consciousness. Morris, 61, said he realizes he is probably the luckiest man alive. \"And luckier that I have such a great wife,\" he said Thursday. His wife, Jo Roop, is a retired Alaska State Trooper. They moved to Seward, about 120 miles south of Anchorage, from Idaho last fall when she took a job with the local police department. On Saturday, they wanted to avoid the big crowds that converge on the Kenai Peninsula community during holidays and decided to hike near Godwin Glacier on an isolated and undeveloped trail behind a state prison, Seward Fire Chief Clinton Crites said. Their trail was actually a rocky creek bed lined with large boulders deposited by the glacier. Morris said he noticed dangerous boulders, some weighing up to 1,000 pounds, along the banks of the creek and avoided them the best he could, until he ran into an area he couldn't pass. \"I was coming back and everything, the whole side slid out from under me,\" he said. He said things became a blur as he tumbled down the embankment about 20 feet, landing face down in the water. Then he immediately felt the boulder hit his back in what Crites described as \"basically an avalanche of boulders.\" The way Morris landed, there were rocks under him, in between his legs and around him that caught the weight of the boulder, preventing him from being crushed, Crites said. But the massive rock still had him pinned, and Morris felt intense pain in his left leg and waited for his femur to snap. \"When it first happened, I was doubtful that there was going to be a good outcome,\" Morris said. His wife tried to free him for about 30 minutes, putting rocks under the boulder and trying to roll it off him, before she left to find a cell signal. Amazingly, she only had to walk about 300 yards to connect with 911 and relied on her law enforcement experience to send exact GPS coordinates to dispatch. A volunteer at the neighboring Bear Creek Fire Department heard the call while working at the sled dog tourism operation and diverted the helicopter used to ferry tourists to the scene. Ultimately, firefighters who couldn't navigate their all-terrain vehicles over the boulder field jumped out of the helicopter. \"The patient was in a boulder field and the helicopter could only hover while firefighters had to jump from the helicopter to the ground as the helicopter could not land safely,\" the Seward Fire Departmentsaidin a statement posted to Facebook. By this time, Morris was hypothermic from the cold water running off the glacier, Crites said, and his wife was holding his head out of the water. \"I think if we hadn't had that private helicopter assist us, it would have taken us at least another 45 minutes to get to him, and I'm not sure he had that much time,\" Crites said. The Bear Creek Fire Department said it assisted the Seward Fire Department. \"After dispatch one of our volunteers who was working with Seward Helicopter Tours contacted us and offered assistance by helicopter,\" the Bear Creek Fire Departmentwroteon Facebook. \"The pilot of the helicopter immediately jumped into action and helped haul gear and rescuers up to the patient aiding in quick response to the patient.\" The firefighters used two airbags normally reserved to extract people from wrecked vehicles to slightly lift the boulder. \"But then it just became an all-hands brute force of 'one, two, three, push,'\" Crites said. \"And seven guys were able to lift it enough to pull the victim out.\" An Alaska National Guard helicopter lifted them out of the creek bed with a rescue basket. Morris spent two nights at the local hospital for observation but walked away unscathed. \"I fully anticipated a body recovery, not him walking away without a scratch on him,\" Crites said. Morris, who is now reflecting on his ordeal at home, acknowledged it might have been a little wake-up call to stop doing things like this at his age. \"I was very lucky. God was looking out for me,\" he said. When he and his wife go hiking this weekend, they are going to stick to established trails. \"We're going to stop the trailblazing,\" he said. \"We are grateful we could support our first responders and help someone in need. So glad this story had a positive ending,\" Seward Helicopter Tourswroteon Facebook. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 29, 2025 / 8:57 PM EDT/ CBS News The Trump administration is shaking up Immigration and Customs Enforcement leadership amid continued frustrations within the White House about the level ofimmigration arrestsand deportations conducted by the agency, officials announced Thursday. Kenneth Genalo will no longer lead Enforcement and Removal Operations, the ICE branch tasked with carrying outarrestsand deportations. Genalo, a longtime ICE official, is retiring and plans to advise agency leaders as a special government employee, officials said. ERO has been spearheading the Trump administration's aggressive and government-wide campaign to ramp up efforts to locate, arrest and deportunauthorized migrantsacross the country. Meanwhile, Robert Hammer, the head of ICE's Homeland Security Investigations office, was reassigned to another post within the agency that officials described as a \"critical leadership position.\" As the Department of Homeland Security's investigative arm, HSI is a specialized law enforcement agency that has historically focused on combating transnational crime, like child exploitation and human trafficking, but many of its agents have been diverted by the Trump administration to support immigration arrest and deportation efforts. Genalo and Hammer will be replaced by Marcos Charles and Derek Gordon, two career ICE officials, the agency said in a statement Thursday. In that statement, ICE portrayed the changes as a \"leadership realignment to support its increasing operational tempo.\" \"Organizational realignments will help ICE achieve President Trump and the American people's mandate of arresting and deporting criminal illegal aliens and making American communities safe,\" the agency said. ICE leadership has faced intense pressure from the White House to increase arrests of migrants who are living in the U.S. illegally or under one of several temporary immigration programs the Trump administration is seeking todismantle. Stephen Miller, the White House's deputy chief of staff, said Wednesday on Fox News that the administration is pushing ICE to carry out \"a minimum\" of 3,000 arrests per day — a target that would amount to an unprecedented expansion of immigration enforcement. In an interview Thursday with CBS News' \"The Takeout,\" White House \"border czar\" Tom Homanconfirmedhe wants to \"vastly increase\" arrests, and argued a 3,000-arrest-per-day target is attainable. \"The numbers are good. ... They're a lot better than the Biden administration. But it's not good enough,\" Homan told CBS News' Major Garrett. Representatives for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. This week's shake-up, firstreportedby NBC News, is not the first time ICE leadership has changed under the second Trump administration. Caleb Vitello, who President Trump initially tapped to lead ICE, was reassigned in February just a few weeks after being named acting director of the agency. He was replaced by Todd Lyons, a top ICE official who continues to serve as acting director. Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 29, 2025 / 8:28 PM EDT/ CBS News Durham, North Carolina— At Riverside High School in Durham, North Carolina, the food is as fresh as can be because most of it comes from local growers. \"We receive local shredded carrots, cucumbers, lettuce, because we feel that we need to support people in our own communities,\" Jim Keaten, who runs the nutrition program for Durham Public Schools, told CBS News. Keaten said the school district's produce comes from local growers under a U.S. Department of Agriculture program that was cut by the Trump administration. \"Immediately, my thoughts were, what are we going to do?\" Keaten said of his first response when he learned the program funding had been cut. \"Because these are the funds we use to provide local foods to kids.\" In March, the White Housecut two federal programsthat provide just over $1 billion in annual funding to school districts and food banks nationwide. It slashed $660 million in funding to the Local Food for Schools program,and another $420 millionto the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement, whichgoes to food banksand other local groups. The impact is being felt in every state, including North Carolina, where CBS News followed the trail of food and funds to assess the impact of the cuts. One of the growers providing food to schools is Pine Knot Farms in Hurdle Mills, about one hour's drive from Riverside High School. Linda Leach-Hughes, co-owner of the farm, said last year it sold $150,000 in produce to local schools. She calls the sudden loss of revenue \"devastating.\" \"If we do not have this extra income coming in to help local folks in the community, then we will have to lay folks off, we can no longer employ folks,\" Leach-Hughes told CBS News. Pine Knot Farms also provides produce to the Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina. Amy Beros, the food bank's president and CEO, said its share of lost aid from the cuts is now at about $2 million. \"I don't understand,\" Beros said. \"We're facing one of the worst hunger crises in decades, and now we're going to increase the need even more. The access to this food makes them not have to choose between the life-saving medicine they need and food for that month.\" The concern over who gets fed is especially felt by those who grow it. \"How are you going to make America great again if you're taking food out of the mouths of babies, senior citizens, nursing homes, rehab centers, hospitals, all of these agencies that are dependent on federal dollars?\" Leah-Hughes asked. \"How are you going to make America great again?\" Aimee  Picchicontributed to this report.

    "title": "Trump's pardons this term include these convicted fraudsters and supporters",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 29, 2025 / 8:20 PM EDT/ CBS News Washington —President Trump this week has issued pardons and commutations for several convicted fraudsters, the latest in a series of pardons for white-collar criminals in his second term, claiming in many cases that they were unfairly targeted for being his supporters. Here are some of the people Mr. Trump has used his clemency power on: Mr. Trump said on May 27 that he wouldpardon reality TV starsTodd and Julie Chrisley, who were imprisoned after being sentenced in 2022 on bank fraud and tax evasion charges. The couple, who starred on \"Chrisley Knows Best,\" submitted false financial statements to obtain more than $30 million in personal loans, which they spent on luxury cars, designer clothes, real estate and travel, the Justice Department said. The couple also concealed their income from the IRS to avoid paying nearly $500,000 in delinquent taxes, while also failing to file tax returns and pay taxes from 2013 through 2016. The couple pleaded not guilty. In avideoposted by a White House aide, Mr. Trump can be heard speaking with the Chrisleys' children, saying \"your parents are going to be free and clean. I hope we can do it by tomorrow.\" The couple's daughter, Savannah, had been seeking a pardon for her parents, and has compared their case to the president's legal troubles. The White House said on May 28 thatMr. Trump had pardoned former Rep. Michael Grimmof New York, who had pleaded guilty in 2014 to tax fraud and related charges. Prosecutors alleged he underreported wages and revenue to the government, and that he filed false tax documents at a restaurant he owned before serving in Congress. Despite the indictment, Grimm was reelected in 2014, although he pleaded guilty one month later and resigned in January 2015. He served eight months in prison. Grimm attempted a comeback run in 2018, but lost the GOP primary for his Staten Island and southern Brooklyn district. Grimm last year was paralyzed from the chest down after being thrown from a horse while playing polo. On May 26, the president said he waspardoning a former Virginia sheriff,Scott Jenkins, who was sentenced to prison in March on fraud and bribery charges. Jenkins took $75,000 worth of bribes, federal prosecutors said, giving badges to eight untrained and unvetted individuals from whom he had allegedly accepted cash and campaign contributions. Jenkinspleaded not guilty, and denied any connection between taking payments and issuing badges at trial. Mr. Trump said in aposton Truth Social that Jenkins, a longstanding supporter of the president's, \"is a victim of an overzealous Biden Department of Justice, and doesn't deserve to spend a single day in jail.\" \"He is a wonderful person, who was persecuted by the Radical Left 'monsters,' and 'left for dead,'\" Mr. Trump added. Devon Archer, a former business partner of Hunter Biden, wasconvictedin 2018 for his connection to a scheme to fraudulently issue more than $60 million of tribal bonds to the business arm of a South Dakota-based Native American tribe. He was sentenced to a year and a day in prison. Archer — who pleaded not guilty — appealed his case, taking it all the way to the Supreme Court, which in 2024 refused to hear his attempt to overturn his conviction. As Mr. Trump prepared to sign the pardon, Trump staff secretary Will Scharf said \"the tone and tenor\" of the case against Archer \"changed dramatically after he began to cooperate with congressional investigators and serve as a witness against Hunter Biden and the Biden family.\" \"Many people have asked me to do this,\" Mr. Trump said before signing the pardon. \"I think he was treated very unfairly. And I looked at the record, studied the records, and he was. He was a victim of a crime, as far as I'm concerned. So we're going to undo that.\" Jason Galanis wassentenced in 2020 to over a decade of prison timefor his alleged involvement in several fraud schemes, including the same one as Archer involving Native American tribal bonds. Mr. Trumpcommuted his sentenceto time served. Galanispleaded guilty. Like Archer, Galanistestifiedin a House GOP-led investigation into Hunter Biden, describing himself as a former business partner of the then-president's son. Galanis said he, Biden and Archer hoped to make \"billions,\" including by trading on Hunter Biden's family name. The younger Biden called Galanis a liar, andtold House investigatorshe could only recall meeting Galanis \"10 years ago for 30 minutes.\" Former Illinois Gov. RodBlagojevichreceived a full pardon from Mr. Trump in February, after the president hadcommutedhis sentence at the end of his first term, in February 2020. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison in December 2011on 18 corruption charges, among them, an attempt to sell Barack Obama's U.S. Senate seat after he won the White House in 2008. Blagojevich and Mr. Trump have known each other for decades. Long before he ran for president, Mr. Trump donated to the former Illinois governor's campaigns, and Blagojevich at one point was also acontestanton NBC's \"Celebrity Apprentice\" in March and April 2010, while he was fighting the corruption charges. He was \"fired\" by Mr. Trump after about four weeks on the show. Trump even asked the other contestants, \"Who thinks Rod is guilty?\" Blagojevich pleaded not guilty and haslong insisted he is innocent. Mr. Trump alsopardoned Michelle Fiore, a former city councilwoman and Nevada state lawmaker, in April. Fiore was accused of using money meant for a statue honoring police officers killed in the line of duty for her own personal expenses and was found guilty in October on wire fraud charges. She pleaded not guilty to the charges. In March, the presidentpardonedformer Tennessee state Sen. Brian Kelsey, shortly after he had begun serving jail time for a campaign finance scheme. The Republican had pleaded guilty in 2022 to charges concerning his attempt to funnel campaign money from his state seat to a federal race for Congress, before trying to reverse the plea. \"God used Donald Trump to save me from the weaponized Biden DOJ,\" Kelsey said in aposton X. Earlier this year, Mr. Trump pardoned Nikola founder Trevor Milton, who was convicted of securities fraud and wire fraud forlying to investorsin his electric truck company. Prosecutors allege Milton boosted the company's share price by heavily exaggerating its successes, including by falsely claiming Nikola had built a \"fully functioning\" prototype of an electric truck and posting misleading videos that made it look like the prototype could drive under its own power. He wascharged in 2021, a year aftersome of the allegationswere first raised by short-selling firm Hindenburg Research. Milton — who denied wrongdoing — was sentenced to four years in prison. But the presidentpardoned him in March, claiming he was targeted for being a Trump supporter. Milton haddonatedhundreds of thousands to a pro-Trump group in 2024. The president commuted the prison sentence of Carlos Watson, who founded the digital media company Ozy, and wassentencedto almost a decade in prison for conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud. Watson and his coworkers allegedly raised millions from investors by misrepresenting Ozy's finances. At one point, an Ozy employee allegedly impersonated a YouTube executive on a call with Goldman Sachs, aiming to convince the bank to invest in Ozy by talking up the success of its YouTube channel — an infamous story documented in aNew York Times column. Mr. Trumpcommuted Watson's sentenceto time served, shortly before he reported to prison. Watson pleaded not guilty, andmaintained his innocenceat trial. In April, Mr. Trump pardoned Paul Walczak, who had been sentenced earlier that month to 18 months in prison for failing to pay over $10 million in taxes related to nursing homes he controlled. According to the Justice Department, Walczak — whopleaded guilty— was \"not compliant with his tax obligations and instead used the withheld taxes to enrich himself.\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in a statement that Walczak is an \"entrepreneur targeted by the Biden administration over his family's conservative politics.\" Walczak's mother, Elizabeth Fago, is a donor to Mr. Trump and visited the White House at least twice in Mr. Trump's first term. According toThe New York Times, Fago attended a $1 million a plate fundraiser for Mr. Trump shortly before Walczak was pardoned. Mr. Trump pardoned former Arkansas state Sen. Jeremy Hutchinson, who had been convicted on bribery and tax charges, on May 29. Hutchinson — the nephew of former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson — pleaded guilty in two different bribery cases in 2019, acknowledging in court papers that he took payments from an orthodontic specialist and a healthcare charity and used his position as a lawmaker to back their interests. He also pleaded guilty to tax charges, Hutchinson wassentencedto a total of eight years in prison. Outside of clemency, the Trump administration has moved to drop charges against a handful of others in recent months. The Justice Department moved to toss out charges against Republican former Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, who had been convicted oflying to the FBI. And in February, the Justice Department told federal prosecutors in New York todrop their corruption caseagainst New York Mayor Eric Adams.

    "title": "Court declares mistrial in death of soccer legend Diego Maradona",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 29, 2025 / 8:06 PM EDT/ CBS/AP An Argentine court on Thursday declared a mistrial in the case of seven health professionals accused of negligence in the death of soccer legendDiego Maradona, the latest soap-operatic turn in the trial that has transfixed the soccer world. The judges ruled there would be a new trial, without specifying when. The pivot comes after one of the three judges overseeing the trial stepped down over criticism surrounding her participation in a forthcoming documentary series about the case, \"Divine Justice,\" which spanned from the aftermath of Maradona's death, as scandals and suspicions of foul play began to emerge, to the start of the trial. In calling for the judge, Julieta Makintach, to be recused, the prosecutor on Tuesday presented the trailer for her documentary — a one-and-a-half-minute teaser that intercuts archival footage of Maradona scoring iconic goals with shots of Makintach strutting through the corridors of the Buenos Aires courthouse in high heels and a short skirt as a string soundtrack heightens suspense. The prosecutor asked judges to investigate allegations that Makintach had violated judicial ethics in allowing a camera crew inside the courthouse to film her overseeing closed-door hearings for the reality TV-style series. As the claims snowballed into a national scandal, Makintach on Tuesday said that she had \"no choice\" but to resign from the case. The judges decided on Thursday to retry the entire case, effectively turning the clock back on all proceedings since March 11, when the trial began amid intense media scrutiny and called dozens of distraught witnesses to testify over 21 hearings. \"Judge Makintach did not act impartially. Her conduct caused harm to both the plaintiffs and the defense,\" Judge Maximiliano Savarino said in declaring the mistrial. \"The only person responsible is the recused judge.\" He added: \"This is an unpleasant decision.\" At the courthouse, two of the soccer star's daughters, Gianinna and Dalma Maradona, began to weep. The decision threw into doubt the timeline of the trial, which was initially expected to last until July. Thursday's ruling said that a higher court would select the three new judges by lottery \"within a reasonable period of time.\" The case accuses Maradona's medical team of failing to provide adequate care for the soccer star in weeks leading up to his sudden death on Nov. 25, 2020. Maradona died at age 60 from cardiac arrest while recovering from surgery for a blood clot on the brain at a rented home outside Buenos Aires. Although the case largely hinges on medical technicalities, the biweekly testimonies have also become tabloid fodder — like much in Maradona's life, which included long spates of drug and alcohol abuse. Experts have taken the stand to allege that Maradona agonized for 12 hours before his death, while his sisters and daughters have tearfully accused his medics of leaving him alone in squalor when he should have been hospitalized. The defendants, who deny all accusations, were charged with culpable homicide, a crime similar to involuntary manslaughter in that it implies the accused were aware of the risk caused by their reckless conduct and ignored it. They include Leopoldo Luque, Maradona's primary physician at the time of his death, as well as his psychologist, psychiatrist, medical coordinator and nurses. The crime carries a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison. The defendants say Maradona was a difficult patient who did not allow himself to be treated. Maradona, who famously led Argentina to victory in the 1986 World Cup, is regarded as one of the greatest soccer players of all time. His rags-to-riches story resonated with his fellow Argentines and he is widely revered as a national hero. Maradona played in four FIFA World Cups during his career with Argentina, leading the team to win the 1986 World Cup title against West Germany. He also coached the national team during the 2010 tournament. One of Maradona's most iconic moments as a player was during the 1986 championship run in Mexico City. Maradona scored a goal in a quarterfinal match against England by lightly using his fist, out of the referees' view. He described the goal as\"the hand of God.\" © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "Pediatrician who helped expose Flint's water crisis now fighting poverty",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 29, 2025 / 8:03 PM EDT/ CBS News Flint, Michigan— At a parade last year in Flint, Michigan, every family and their babies celebrated a gift from the same woman —pediatrician Dr. Mona Hanna. \"How can you say no to these babies? Like how can you say no?\" Hanna told CBS News. Rx kids, a program she created to give cash to pregnant moms, is an American first. \"I wanted something that literally would be able to prescribe away the pathogen of poverty,\" Hanna said. \"I wanted something that I could pull out of my doctor's bag, pull out of my white coat that literally would be able to prescribe away the pathogen of poverty. Poverty makes kids sick. So I wanted to prevent it.\" She's raised more than $100 million, 80% of which is from private donors. Now, every expectant mother in Flint, regardless of income, can get $1,500 during her pregnancy. Once the baby is born, it's $500 a month for up to a year — no strings attached. \"So what we are hearing from our families is that this amount of money is a lifesaver, a game changer for our families,\" Hanna said. \"They can afford to pay their rent. They can buy diapers for their baby. They can buy formula. They don't have to choose between being homeless or having a roof over their heads.\" When asked how to know if the money is being spent on the right things, Hanna said, \"This is based on global evidence. Our families...through multiple surveys, we know that they're spending this money No. 1 on baby supplies, and then on food, rent utilities, transportation, childcare.\" \"We are telling families, 'We see you, we hear you, and we trust you,'\" she added. Hanna knows child poverty runs in Flint's bloodstream. In 2015,she brought national attentionto the city's corroding water pipes andlinked them to children with lead poisoning. Now she's tackling poverty. In four areas of Michigan, any expectant mother can apply. But in Flint, the program reports 60% of enrolled families have an annual household income of less than $10,000. When Angela Sintery was pregnant with her daughter Jolena, she remembers filling out a five-minute questionnaire. \"Two weeks later, I had money in my bank account,\" Sintery said, adding that the money allowed her not to stress out and focus on her baby instead. Michigan State Sen. John Damoose is a conservative Republican from a red district. He's no fan of handouts, but pushed hard to get Rx Kids in his district. \"It's extremely efficient. There's no government bureaucracy whatsoever. This is actually a great program that meets people right where they need it,\" Damoose said. Since early last year, Rx Kids has spread roughly $10 million to more than 2,200 families. \"This is a plug-and-play program. It is already built with dollars at the table. We are ready to go live in communities across the nation,\" Hanna said. Mark Strassmann is CBS News' senior national correspondent based in Atlanta. He covers a wide range of stories, including space exploration. Strassmann is also the senior national correspondent for \"Face the Nation.\" © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "title": "Inside the scramble to keep FEMA alive ahead of hurricane season",
    "article_text": "Publicly, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has said the Federal Emergency Management Agency needs to be reoriented or even done away with altogether. “We are eliminating FEMA,” Noem said at a televised meeting of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet in March. But with hurricane season about to start, Noem has been quietly pushing behind the scenes to keep key employees in place and to approve reimbursements to states previously hit by disaster, sources familiar with the situation told NBC News. Trumphimself talked about possibly “getting rid of”FEMA shortly after he was inaugurated for his second term, while he was touring North Carolina to see areas of the state damaged by Hurricane Helene. There has been no public indication that his administration, including Noem, is reconsidering that stance — indeed, the administration’s original acting FEMA administrator, Cameron Hamilton, wasremoved from the jobone day after he testified at a congressional hearing that he does not think “it is in the best interests of the American people to eliminate” FEMA. Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, has told NBC News that the move was not a response to his testimony. There does, however, appear to be some internal recognition that, absent a plan ready for how the country would move forward without FEMA, important elements of the agency and its work have to remain in place for now. According to internal documents reviewed by NBC News, on May 19, Noem approved a request from newly installed acting FEMA Administrator David Richardson to retain 2,652 employees whose terms had been set to expire between April and December. The employees are part of FEMA’s Cadre of On-Call Response/Recovery Employees (CORE) group, for which people are always hired for specific periods of two to four years; their departures this year would have left FEMA without a large number of key employees during hurricane season. According to areport by the Government Accountability Office, FEMA had 8,802 total CORE employees as of fiscal year 2022. A FEMA employee told NBC News that the workforce seemed surprised and pleased that Noem decided to keep the CORE employees on during hurricane season after the administration had moved to cut them. The same week FEMA was moving to keep those key employees in place, the White House was suddenly approving disaster recovery reimbursement requests from 10 states, including some that had been stalled for months, accounting for 20% of all such approvals in Trump’s second term, according toFEMA disaster approval data online. Three sources familiar with Noem’s recent actions say she has taken an outsized role compared with previous secretaries in pushing the White House to support FEMA and reimburse states. State and local governments are entitled by statute to have 75% of their costs for disasters reimbursed by the federal government. Anything above that is determined by a fixed formula or, if the formula's requirements are not met, by the president. In the past, the White House generally approved what FEMA officials determined was appropriate based on those formulas, leaving the homeland security secretary to function largely as a rubber stamp, according to two sources familiar with the disaster approval process. But with the White House pushing to downsize FEMA’s role and encourage more states to bail themselves out, at least as of last week, the White House had repeatedly pushed back against FEMA’s recommendations, according to one of the sources familiar with Noem’s recent actions. And Noem had gotten involved. Asked for comment on this article, McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, said in a statement: “This is a sad attempt by the mainstream media to drive a false narrative that there is daylight between President Trump and Secretary Noem. To the media’s chagrin, there’s not. Secretary Noem has been implementing President Trump’s vision for the future of FEMA to shift it away from a bloated, DC-centric bureaucracy that has let down the American people.” Because previous administrations typically approved reimbursements that FEMA determined should be made, states might not have the ability to shoulder the burden without having planned for it years in advance. “For a state like North Carolina, it’s significant. And in a state like Alabama or Mississippi, it would bankrupt the state,” said Michael Coen, who was chief of staff at FEMA during the Biden administration. “They would have to take out a bond. They would have to look at how they increase tax revenue. For some of these states, it might be twice what their annual budget is for the year. So when the DHS secretary or White House is saying states are going to have to own the problem ... these states are going to need to have a different mindset for how they budget.” Though the CORE employees are being kept on, a large number of FEMA’s senior executives have left this year, largely voluntarily, raising concerns internally and among outside observers and members of Congress about its ability to respond during hurricane season. Sixteen senior officials whose departures were announced in an internal email last week had a combined 228 years of experience at FEMA. Four additional senior executive departures were announced Wednesday in an email from the acting chief of staff at FEMA, who is herself set to step down. “It’s like having a relay team, and instead of having six members you’ve only got four, and yeah, you can do it, but those four runners are going to have to run more than they’re trained for,” the FEMA employee said. CORRECTION (May 29, 2025, 10:04 p.m. ET): An earlier version of this article misspelled the last name of a former FEMA chief of staff. He is Michael Coen, not Cohen.",

    "article_text": "\"Éclaircissement\" was the winning word, but for Faizan Zaki it spelled success. The seventh grader from Dallas won the Scripps National Spelling Bee on Thursday, after last year having come in second place on the big stage. Faizan, 13, showed little hesitation as he spelled \"éclaircissement,\" which means the clearing up of something obscure, in the final word to win the title of national spelling champ. He fell to the stage in joy as confetti rained down. “I don’t know what to say. I’m just really happy,” he said. The culmination of the national championship came with a shock. In what could have been the last round, when there were three left, Sarvadnya Kadam and Sarv Dharavane got their words wrong. It seemed to be Faizan’s big chance. But he rushed to spell his word before a proper explanation and got the first letter wrong — a blunder on \"commelina,\" a genus of plant that sent all three back for an additional round. Faizan joked about the pressure when he later faced what would be the winning word and after the spelling bee's official pronouncer, Jacques Bailly, suggested everyone take a deep breath. \"That did not help at all,\" Faizan said, eliciting laughter from the crowd. Nine spellers made it to Thursday’s final round, from Arizona, California, New York, New Jersey, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Texas. This year is the 100th anniversary of the Scripps National Spelling Bee. In the first contest, there were just nine participants. How times have changed. This year, 243 young people competed in the Spelling Bee, which kicked off Tuesday in National Harbor, Maryland. Those 243 young spellers made their way to the national competition after having qualified in regional contests in March. Almost all of the kids who made it to the nationals were there for the first time, organizers said. Fifty-three were in the 2024 national contest, while 178 were national first-timers.",

    "title": "Bernard Kerik, New York police commissioner on 9/11, dies at 69",
    "article_text": "Bernard Kerik, who was New York City’s police commissioner on 9/11 and later pleaded guilty to tax fraud before being pardoned, has died. He was 69. The New York Police Department confirmed his death Thursday on social media. FBI Director Kash Patel said his death came “after a private battle with illness.” Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani reflected on his long history with his former police commissioner onhis show Thursday. “We’ve been together since the beginning. He’s like my brother,” Giuliani said through tears. “I was a better man for having known Bernie. I certainly was a braver and stronger man.” “We’ve been together since the beginning. He’s like my brother,” Giuliani said through tears. “I was a better man for having known Bernie. I certainly was a braver and stronger man.” Kerik, an Army veteran, was hailed as a hero after the 9/11 attack and eventually nominated to head the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, before a dramatic fall from grace that ended with him behind bars. He pleaded guilty to federal tax fraud and false statement charges in 2010. The charges stemmed partially from over $250,000 in apartment renovations he received from a construction firm that authorities say counted on Kerik to convince New York officials it had no organized crime links. During Kerik’s sentencing, the judge noted that he committed some of the crimes while serving as “the chief law enforcement officer for the biggest and grandest city this nation has.” He served three years in prison before his release in 2013. President Donald Trump pardoned Kerikduring a 2020 clemency blitz. Kerik was among the guests feting Trump after his first appearance in federal court in Florida in a case related to his handling of classified documents, attending the former president’s remarks at his Bedminster, New Jersey, club. Kerik was appointed by Giuliani to serve as police commissioner in 2000 and was in the position during the Sept. 11, 2001, attack. In Kerik’s 2015 book, “From Jailer to Jailed,” he described becoming “America’s Top Cop” after the attack. “But I’d give anything for that day not to have happened. I wish it hadn’t. But it did,” he wrote. “And I happened to be there at the time. I was there, and I did the best I could do under the circumstances. It’s all any of us did.” He was tapped by President George W. Bush to help organize Iraq’s police force in 2003, then nominated to head the U.S. Department of Homeland Security the following year. But Kerik caught the administration off guard when he abruptly withdrew his nomination, saying he had uncovered information that led him to question the immigration status of a person he employed as a housekeeper and nanny. In 2005, Kerik founded the Kerik Group, a crisis and risk management consulting firm. He later worked for the former mayor of New York City surrounding the efforts to overturn Trump’s 2020 loss. Patel described Kerik in a post on social media as “a warrior, a patriot, and one of the most courageous public servants this country has ever known.” “He was decorated more than 100 times for bravery, valor, and service, having rescued victims from burning buildings, survived assassination attempts, and brought some of the world’s most dangerous criminals to justice,” he said. “His legacy is not just in the medals or the titles, but in the lives he saved, the city he helped rebuild, and the country he served with honor.” Kerik grew up in Paterson, New Jersey, where he dropped out of the the trouble-filled Eastside High School later depicted in the 1989 film “Lean on Me.” He joined the Army, where he became a military policeman stationed in South Korea. He went on to work private security in Saudi Arabia before returning stateside to supervise a jail in New Jersey. He joined the NYPD in the late 1980s. He was tapped in the 1990s to run New York’s long-troubled jail system, including the city’s notorious Riker’s Island complex.",

    "article_text": "Six dead gray whales have been found in the area of San Francisco Bay over the last week, officials said Wednesday, in a year when there has been an unusually high number of sightings in the area. The gray whales were found dead from May 21 to Wednesday, when one was found washed ashore at Point Reyes National Seashore,the California Academy of Sciences said. On Monday, two were found the same day — one on Alcatraz and one at Point Bonita, it said. In most of the cases, no necropsy, which is like an autopsy for an animal, was performed. The partial necropsy for a yearling gray whale found at Bolinas was inconclusive, and results from the necropsy on the whale found Wednesday are pending, the academy said. The whales have died as an unusually large number of them have been spotted in San Francisco Bay, officials said. Why the whales died was not clear. “That is the open question, the why,” Giancarlo Rulli, a spokesperson for the Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito,told NBC Bay Area this week. “Why not only are there so many deceased whales in the region, but why has it been a banner year of having more sightings in San Francisco Bay of live whales than we have seen in at least two-plus decades, if ever?” So far this year 14 gray whales and a minke whale have died in the greater San Francisco Bay Area, the academy said, and the deaths of three of them were found to be from boat strikes. More gray whales have been sighted in the bay this year compared with last, it said — 33, compared with only six in 2024. Some have looked normal and others emaciated, it said. \"The reason or potential reasons behind the massive spike in sightings this year are still being investigated by researchers,\" the academy said. \"It is expected that gray whales will be in the bay for another one to two weeks before continuing their annual northern migration to arctic feeding grounds.\" Gray whales used to be common in waters throughout the Northern Hemisphere but are now regularly found only in the North Pacific Ocean,according to the National Marine Fisheries Service, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. They travel around 10,000 miles in an annual round-trip migration, it said. Gray whales are known to be curious around boats, which means they are often seen on whale-watching trips, the agency said. They can grow to around 49 feet long and weigh about 90,000 pounds. Because of the long migration, the whales are sometimes hit by vessels and entangled in fishing gear, which are among their top threats, the fisheries service says.",

    "article_text": "Jalen Brunson scored 32 points, Karl-Anthony Towns added 24 points and 13 rebounds despite a bruised left knee and the New York Knicks stayed alive in the Eastern Conference finals by beating the Indiana Pacers 111-94 on Thursday night in Game 5. The Knicks won on their home floor for the first time in the series and prevented the Pacers from earning the second NBA Finals trip in franchise history. Indiana will try again Saturday night at home. Knicks fans chanted “Knicks in 7! Knicks in 7!” in the final minutes as New York extended its first trip to the conference finals since 2000 and kept alive hopes of becoming the 14th team to overcome a 3-1 deficit to win a series. No team has won a conference finals series after dropping the first two games at home. Two nights after giving up 43 points in the first quarter, the Knicks held the Pacers to just 45 in the first half and limited Tyrese Haliburton, who had 32 points, 15 assists and 12 rebounds Tuesday, to just eight points and six assists. Brunson, outplayed by his point guard counterpart Tuesday, rebounded with his franchise-record 20th postseason game of 30 or more points with the Knicks. Bennedict Mathurin scored 23 points off the bench for the Pacers, who had won six straight road games. Indiana shot just 40.5% from the field in by far its lowest-scoring game of the postseason. Brunson scored 14 in the first quarter as the Knicks held a 27-23 lead — giving up 20 fewer points than in the first quarter of Game 4, when they trailed 43-35. Towns, who was questionable to play after hurting his left knee in a collision late in Game 4, picked up the slack with 12 in the second, when Brunson was scoreless. Brunson came back with the Knicks’ first eight of the third quarter as they opened a 20-point lead midway through the period. The Pacers cut that in half before New York regained control with a 12-0 burst, highlighted by Brunson’s four-point play, to make it 86-64.",

    "article_text": "The FBI’s top two leaders said in interviews on Fox News that the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide, and they promised to release a surveillance video from the federal jail in New York City where Epstein was found dead. Officials in the first Trump administration ruled that Epstein’s death in 2019 was a suicide. But it has remained the subject of conspiracy theories suggesting he was murdered because of his connections to high-profile celebrities and politicians. Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino, a former pro-Trump podcaster, said Thursday morning on Fox News that the video showed that no one entered or approached Epstein’s cell at the time of his suicide. Bongino also said no forensic evidence had been found suggesting that another person was present. “There’s no DNA, there’s no audio, there’s no fingerprints, there’s no suspects, there’s no accomplices, there’s no tips, there is nothing,” said Bongino, who asked members of the public to share any evidence of wrongdoing in the case. “If you have it, I’m happy to see it.” “There’s video clear as day,” he added. “He’s the only person in there and the only person coming out. You can see it.” In a separate interview Wednesday night on Fox News, FBI Director Kash Patel also said Epstein had died by suicide, and he promised to release additional information about the case. “We are diligently working on that,” Patel said. “It takes time to go through years of investigations.” Before Bongino became deputy FBI director, herepeatedly promoted conspiracy theoriesabout Epstein’s death. In a Jan. 4, 2024, podcast, Bongino played a clip in which a journalist said she was “100%” convinced that Epstein was killed “because he made his whole living blackmailing people.” Bongino told his listeners that he’d heard the same claims from another reporter and that they were “super important.” “This is where I get really upset at the media,” Bongino said later in the podcast, contending that reporters had “done almost like no — maybe because I was an investigator before, it’s like, I’m amazed at how few people are putting two and two together.” Roughly two weeks before Trump named Bongino FBI deputy director, Bongino spokeagain aboutEpstein. He said again that a reporter had told him about the existence of tapes that Epstein used to blackmail powerful people and then mentioned an allegation he’d heard involving Bill Clinton. “I’m not ever gonna let this story go,” Bongino promised on Feb. 10. “I’m not letting it go ever.” For years before they took office, Patel and Bongino also claimed that the Biden administration and corrupt “deep state” actors had “weaponized” the FBI against Donald Trump. They accused the bureau of covering up what it knew about pipe bombs placed outside the offices of the Republican and Democratic national committees in Washington before the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S Capitol. They suggested that FBI operatives helped ignite the Capitol riot. And they said FBI agents committed crimes and tried to “overthrow” Trump. But large numbers of Trump supporters who believe those claims are publicly asking: Why aren’t Patel and Bongino arresting and prosecuting the people Patel labeled “government gangsters\"? An FBI spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In his interview on “Fox & Friends,” Bongino also said the job was taking a toll on his family. “The biggest lifestyle change is family-wise,” he said. “It was a lot, and it’s been tough on the family. People ask all the time, do you like it? No. I don’t,” Bongino said. “But the president didn’t ask me to do this to like it — nobody likes going into an organization like that and having to make big changes.” Last weekend, Bongino announced on X that the FBI is re-examining multiple cases from the Biden era, including the 2021 pipe bombs at the DNC and the RNC, the 2022 leak of the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade and a small bag of cocaine that was found in the White House in 2023. On Thursday, Bongino said the FBI is close to solving one of the three cases, without saying which one. “We got a fascinating tip on one of these cases, one of the three,” he said. “We’re going to run it out. We’re not going to be able to make that public, obviously, right away, because we have to make sure.” Three weeks before the Trump administration took office,the FBI releasedwhat it said was new video of the masked person planting bombs outside the Republican and Democratic headquarters in Washington. But FBI officials said they hadn’t identified a suspect or even determined for certain whether the figure was a man or a woman. Before he was named deputy FBI director, Bongino accused the FBI of lying about that person on one of his podcasts. “I believe the FBI knows the identity of this pipe bomber on Jan. 6th, four years ago, and just doesn’t want to tell us because it was an inside job,”he said. In an interview with conspiracy theorist and political commentator Julie Kelly, Bongino said, “I’m convinced the person who planted that pipe bomb at the DNC on Jan. 6th was there to create a fake assassination attempt because they needed to stop Republicans from questioning in front of a national TV audience what happened in the 2020 election.” Patel also said in his Fox News interview Wednesday that the FBI has new leads in the pipe bomb case. He accused the Biden administration of having “slow-rolled” the investigation but offered no specific examples. Bongino defended reopening the investigation into who left a small bag of cocaine in the White House during the Biden administration. Bongino, a former Secret Service agent, argued that the probe was relaunched for safety reasons, not to score political points. “I was a Secret Service agent. A potentially hazardous material made its way into the White House,” he said on Fox News. “Nobody seems to know how it got there, and nobody seemed to get to investigate it fully. ... What planet do we live on where that’s not of public interest?” If you or someone you know is in crisis, call or text 988, or go to988lifeline.org, to reach the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.

    "article_text": "Authorities are investigating how anembalmed infant from Dallasended up in a shipment of linens delivered to a dry cleaner in Shreveport, Louisiana. Just after 9 p.m. on Tuesday, Shreveport police were called to Alsco Uniforms on Hollywood Avenue after employees reported finding what appeared to be a mummified infant wrapped in laundry. “It was a very disturbing scene,” said Cpl. Chris Bordelon. “Officers found what was a small infant, what was described as mummified.” Detectives determined the linens came from Golden Gate Funeral Home in Dallas. Police said the child died on May 3 and was scheduled to be cremated following a funeral service on May 17, but the body instead ended up in a shipment of laundry bound for Shreveport. “It was a very bizarre set of circumstances,” Bordelon said. “Our violent crimes team began their investigation and were able to track down the load of linens.” Detectives believe the infant had been embalmed, based on the strong odor and early signs of decomposition observed at the scene. “The detective on scene even told me it smelled strongly of formaldehyde, which is something that’s not typical of any of our crime scenes,” Bordelon said. The baby was found wearing clothing embroidered with the initials “K.M.,” the only identity police have officially confirmed. No foul play is suspected, but investigators said the incident appears to involve negligence. “This clearly is some type of act of negligence, whether it be on the part of a cleaning service for the funeral home or the funeral home itself,” Bordelon said. The remains are now in the custody of the Caddo Parish Coroner’s Office, which is coordinating to return the child to the family in Dallas. Authorities said that the Texas Funeral Service Commission has been notified and that the investigation will continue across state lines. “There are laws when it comes to discarding of bodies, and the funeral home and or any individuals involved could be subject to those laws,” Bordelon said. NBC Dallas Fort Worth reached out to Golden Gate Funeral Home, which declined to comment. “This is an unfortunate set of circumstances that no family should have to go through,” Bordelon said.",

    "title": "Did having a job in the prison kitchen help 'Devil in the Ozarks' police chief escape?",
    "article_text": "CALICO ROCK, Ark. — Arkansas authorities are looking at whether a job in the prison kitchen played a role in theweekend escape of a convicted former police chief known as the \"Devil in the Ozarks.\" Grant Hardin, 56,was housed in a maximum-security wing of the medium-security Calico Rock prison, where he also held a job in the kitchen, Arkansas Department of Corrections spokesperson Rand Champion said Thursday. Authorities have said Hardin escaped Sunday by donning an outfit designed to look like a law enforcement uniform. \"His job assignment was in the kitchen, so just looking to see if that played a part in it as well,\" Champion told The Associated Press. The kitchen is divided into two shifts of about 25 workers each, according to a 2021 accreditation report that involved an extensive review of the prison. In the kitchen, \"tools and utensils were stored on shadow boards with proper controls for sign out/in of all tools,\" the report states. \"A check of the inventory control sheets found them to be accurate and up to date.\" The kitchen is in one of 16 buildings on over 700 acres (280 hectares) of prison land. The sprawling grounds include a garden, two greenhouses, and extensive pasture lands where a herd of more than 100 horses is raised and trained by staff and inmates. Hardin, the former police chief in the small town of Gateway near the Arkansas-Missouri border, was serving lengthy sentences for murder and rape. He was the subject of the TV documentary \"Devil in the Ozarks.\" A prison expert said corrections officials are likely investigating whether the kitchen job gave Hardin access to other parts of the prison or to tools in the kitchen that could have helped him, including fashioning the makeshift uniform. Bryce Peterson, a criminal justice expert at security-based research organization CNA, said prison escapes are usually a combination of motivation and opportunity. \"You wouldn't immediately think of a kitchen as a source of a bunch of escape tools,\" Peterson said. \"But these people are really smart and what they're thinking about day in and day out is how they can escape if that's what their motivation is.\" Local, state and federal law enforcement are continuing their search for Hardin, and the FBI announced Thursday it was offering a reward of up to $10,000 for information leading to his arrest. Champion said officials remained confident that Hardin was in the north-central Arkansas area. Officials have said there are plenty of hideouts in the Ozark Mountains area, from caves to campsites. Authorities on Thursday continued to stop cars at a checkpoint near Calico Rock, and fliers featuring photos of Hardin could be seen in local store windows. Elsewhere Thursday, a sheriff's office in southern Missouri said it had received a report of a sighting of someone resembling Hardin's description in the Moody/Bakersfield area, less than an hour's drive north of Calico Rock. Deputies with the Howell County Sheriff's Office responded but were unable to locate anyone though agents were continuing to canvass the area, the agency said in a Facebook post. \"At this time, we have no information indicating with any degree of certainty this suspicious person was the escapee or that he is even in the state of Missouri,\" the post said. Champion said Arkansas authorities were aware of the tip and were looking into it. The department late Wednesday said search teams also responded to Faulkner County in the central Arkansas area after receiving a tip. Champion did not immediately know how many other inmates were housed in the prison's maximum-security wing. Hardin's assignment to the prison, formally known as the North Central Unit, has drawn questions from legislators in the area and family members of the former chief's victims. Hardin received culinary training at some point during his incarceration, said Cheryl Tillman, whose brother James Appleton was shot to death by Hardin in 2017. Tillman said she was aware that Hardin had been working in the kitchen at the Calico Rock prison and questioned why he would be allowed to do so. \"It sounds like to me that he was given free range down there,\" she said this week during an interview. Now that he's free, \"it makes it uneasy for all of us, the whole family,\" she said.",

    "article_text": "By The Associated Press Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. speaks as Education Secretary Linda McMahon listens during a Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) Commission Event in the East Room of the White House, Thursday, May 22, 2025, in Washington.Jacquelyn Martin/APhide caption WASHINGTON — The White House will fix errors in a much-anticipated federal government report spearheaded by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., which decried America's food supply, pesticides and prescription drugs. Kennedy's wide-ranging \"Make America Healthy Again\" report, released last week, cited hundreds of studies, but acloser look by the news organization NOTUSfound that some of those studies did not actually exist. Asked about the report's problems, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the report will be updated. \"I understand there was some formatting issues with the MAHA report that are being addressed and the report will be updated.\" Leavitt told reporters during her briefing. \"But it does not negate the substance of the report, which, as you know, is one of the most transformative health reports that has ever been released by the federal government. Kennedy has repeatedly said he would bring \"radical transparency\" and \"gold-standard\" science to the public health agencies. But the secretary refused to release details about who authored the 72-page report, which calls for increased scrutiny of the childhood vaccine schedule and describes the nation's children as overmedicated and undernourished. Leavitt said that the White House has \"complete confidence\" in Kennedy. \"Minor citation and formatting errors have been corrected,\" HHS Spokesman Andrew Nixon said in an emailed statement. He described the report as a \"historic and transformative assessment by the federal government to understand the chronic disease epidemic afflicting our nation's children.\" NOTUS reported Thursday that seven of the more than 500 studies cited in the report did not appear to have ever been published. An author of one study confirmed that while she conducted research on the topics of anxiety in children, she never authored the report listed. Some studies were also misinterpreted in the MAHA report. The problematic citations were on topics around children's screen time, medication use and anxiety. Kennedy's MAHA report had already been stoking concerns among Trump loyalists, including farmers who criticized how the report characterized the chemicals sprayed on U.S. crops. The report is supposed to be used to develop policy recommendations that will be released later this year. The White House has requested a $500 million boost in funding from Congress for Kennedy's MAHA initiative. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "As the Scripps bee turns 100, a new champion is crowned while past winners reflect",
    "article_text": "By Ayana Archie Balu Natarajan won the Scripps National Spelling Bee in 1985. Shown are his trophy and newspaper clippings detailing his win.PS Photography/Balu Natarajanhide caption Faizan Zaki, a 13-year-old from Texas, has just won this year's national Scripps Spelling Bee. His winning word was \"éclaircissement,\" a French word that means clarification, explanation or enlightenment. Zaki is the 100th winner of the bee and last year's runner-up. The first competition was held in 1925 in Washington, D.C., and only nine kids participated, according to Scripps. Eleven-year-old Frank Neuhauser won $500 in gold pieces. This year, more than 200 students competed, and for making it to the end, Zaki will take home more than $50,000, a medal, trophy and reference library. As he joined the club of Scripps champions, several former winners reflected on their victories and how the national bee has evolved, namely becoming more popular (thanks to television) and more competitive (in 2019, eight children tied for first place). \"Luge\" is a type of small sled in which two people can ride downhill sitting or lying down. In 1984, it was Dan Greenblatt's winning word at the national bee, and the shortest winning word ever. After beating 150 other students, Greenblatt said he was whisked to California to do talk show interviews, which \"cured me of my desire to be unreservedly famous. I didn't want to be a TV star much after that.\" Before the bee, Greenblatt studied by repeatedly going over words with his mom. \"Everything was spell till you drop,\" he said. Now, the competition has become much more intense, Greenblatt said. Spellers have coaches, and there are written and vocabulary tests at the national bee.The eight-way tie winnersin 2019 were nicknamed the \"octo-champs.\" \"They're going to have to make more changes in the future to kind of stay one step ahead of the game in that regard,\" he said. \"I think that broke a lot of brains.\" Greenblatt doesn't do much spelling these days, at least not with the rigor of the Scripps bee. He has judged some local bees, but has spent his career as a software engineer. For a long time, he said he shied away from telling others about his championship status, as it would often overtake conversations. But ultimately, he said winning the bee helped him get over his fear of public speaking, made him comfortable on camera and gifted him with fearlessness. \"Everybody fails at something, at least once in a while in their lives. And it's nothing to be ashamed of. You learn from your mistakes and you go on. I think that's a good thing for kids to experience,\" he said. Balu Natarajan, an 8th grade student at Jefferson Junior High School in Woodbridge, Ill., holds his trophy with the aid of William R. Burleigh, vice president of Scripps Howard Newspapers, sponsor of the National Spelling Bee, after he won the competition in Washington, on June 6, 1985.Bob Daugherty/APhide caption In his three consecutive runs at the Scripps national bee, Balu Natarajan would prepare by combing through a giant dictionary with his parents, writing the words on index cards and using them as flashcards. In 1985, he became the first Indian American to win the Scripps bee by correctly spelling \"milieu,\" which refers to someone's social background. \"There was a lot of intrigue about an immigrant son winning the national spelling bee, and it really validated for me quite a bit the fact that persevering mattered,\" he said. Now, Natarajan's sons compete in the national bee. Natarajan, a physician, said when he was growing up, the home computer wasn't used as a study tool. But now his sons are able to learn about five times the number of words he did using the tech. \"I think it's remarkable what these kids do,\" Natarajan said. \"They really put forth this incredible effort, and being able to prepare for this, it is really like a marathon or an Olympic sport.\" Kerry Close Guaragno's winning word was \"ursprache,\" a German word meaning a parent language. She competed four times before reaching first place, and that experience has come in handy for her job in public relations. \"Being a strong writer, being good with language is a big part of my job,\" she said. \"But also, I would say the fact that the bee taught me poise under pressure, how to think on your feet and think strategically definitely comes in handy.\" They are lessons today's contestants will need, as the variety of words used in the bee continues to climb. Students are now being asked to spell phrases, genuses, medical drugs and more. But like Natarajan, one of Close Guaragno's most important takeaways from her time at the bee is to keep going. And to all the other Scripps competitors, she says, \"You made it here, that's the big achievement. You made it to the national championship, and not every kid gets to do that. Be proud of that accomplishment.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "‘Scream 7’ Is Getting a Time Jump From the Franchise’s Previous Installments",
    "article_text": "Details regardingScream 7are starting to trickle out as the horror franchise detours back into a story with its original remaining stars. As original film scribe Kevin Williamson takes the helm of aScreamfilm for the first time, he’s bringing it all together with Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox) as they encounter ghosts of friends andghostfaces past, includingDavid Arquette, Scott Foley, and Matthew Lillard. Some of theScreamreboot core cast also remains, with Mason Gooding and Jasmine Savoy reprising their roles as the Meeks twinsÂ  But now there’s the development that the film will jump ahead in time for a “really cool reasonâ as shared by the film’s writer Guy Busick toComicBook.com. Busick continued to elaborate why the movie has become a Sidney-centered story, making the series’ original final girl once again the lead. âI donât want to give anything away about the reason[Scream 7] had to be a Sidney movie because thereâs a really cool reason,â Busick told ComicBook. âIn all these movies, you have to ask, âWhy now? What is the thingScreamis commenting on now?âScreamis always in a conversation with the audience about the state of movies, the state of horror movies and in particular, franchises.â He shared that her participation was tantamount to the new installment’s themes. âWe went to Neve Campbell and said, âThis is why. This is why Sidney now.â Neve was like, âOh, I get that.â I pitched Kevin [Williamson] this first, too. He got it and then I pitched the studio.â He added that the new movie will not be set in New York, as the previous film was. It will also feature a time jump. âI donât want to be the one to spoil where it is,” Busick said; he also was vague on the time shift, but for seemingly less spoiler-y reasons. “Itâs an unspecified amount of time [afterScream VI]. I might get contradicted by other people, but in my mind, more than two years. I would say at least two years. It could be two years, but I would say two years plus.â Many are rightfully mad thatMelissa Barrera was controversially pushed outof leading the franchise’s rebirth, and the repercussions of that might affect the interest with this particular sequel. It remains to be seen if bringing back so many past characters will be enough to compensate for perhaps wrongfully abandoning the Carpenter sisters storyline.

    "article_text": "Get all the help you need with today's Wordle. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. OurWordletips can improve every game, and the best part is they can be quickly skimmed over in just a minute or two. Truly taking them on board might take longer, but that's why we've got today's answer waiting below, as well as a brand new hint for the May 30 (1441) puzzle too. After three rows featuring not much of anything at all, my fourth attempt at not completely embarrassing myself in front of today's Wordle turned out to be… OK. It wasn't a win, but it was more than enough to finally get a few yellow letters to fall into place, and it was smooth sailing from that point on. This is a special term for a group of words that take on a unique and non-literal meaning when grouped together. \"Break a leg\", for example. Yes, there is a double letter in today's puzzle. A good starting word can be the difference between victory and defeat with the daily puzzle, but once you've got the basics, it's much easier to nail down those Wordle wins. And as there's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day, here are a few tips to help set you on the right path: There's no racing against the clock with Wordle so you don't need to rush for the answer. Treating the game like a casual newspaper crossword can be a good tactic; that way, you can come back to it later if you're coming up blank. Stepping away for a while might mean the difference between a win and a line of grey squares. Need some help? The answer to the May 30 (1441) Wordle isIDIOM. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Past Wordle answers can give you some excellent ideas for fun starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. They are also a good way to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer is unlikely to be repeated. Here are some recent Wordle answers: Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day, and you'll need to work out which secret five-letter word is hiding inside them to keep up your winning streak. You shouldstart with a strong wordlike ARISE, or any other word that contains a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You'll also want to avoid starting words with repeating letters, as you're wasting the chance to potentially eliminate or confirm an extra letter. Once you hit Enter, you'll see which ones you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the dailyWordlepuzzle to give readers a hint each and every day. Her Wordle streak is truly mighty.

    "title": "Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 didn’t invent Final Frenchtasy or the J'RPG: the newly dubbed subgenre has a long and complicated history",
    "article_text": "Pas mal, non? C'est français. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Sometimes all it takes to make a new subgenre is an apostrophe. With just one hardworking punctuation mark, the newly christened J'RPG describes a refreshingly French spin on Japanese turn-based roleplaying games, and players can't get enough of its irresistibleje ne sais quoi. J'RPG is a particularly brilliant fit forClair Obscur: Expedition 33. Sandfall Interactive's tale of saving dark-fantasy Paris from a series of increasingly unhappy birthdays boasts whimsical mimes, gilded Belle Epoque architecture, and an English voice cast able to dropmerdeandputainlike they're in a Marseille rap battle. But Sandfall's debut—undeniably, spectacularly, proudly French—is just the latest title to deserve the name J'RPG. Last year'sSea of Stars, which just released its free DLC Throes of the Watchmaker, was made by French-Canadian Sabotage Studios in Quebec. While you won't spot Québécois famous landmarks like the Château Frontenac hotel recreated in pixel art to answer Clair Obscur's crumpled Eiffel Tower, you will find Gaëtan Piment, a character who speaks entirely in the regional French dialect (there's even a French Canadian language option), phoenix down replaced by poutine as must-have revives, and groan-worthy French puns whenever you discover a new enemy. These J'RPGs may share Francophone origins, but they're two sides of the same coin. Clair Obscur's influences are 3D JRPGs: its combat systems, environment design and kaleidoscopic UI effects infused with the DNA of Final Fantasy 7–10, Lost Odyssey, and Persona's PlayStation 2 and later entries. Sea of Stars looks further back to the 16-bit era, evoking the lush pixel art of Chrono Trigger and timed attacks of Super Mario RPG, with thoughtful modernisations to take the sting from bugbears like MP management and level grinding. There's a simple reason for that crucial difference: The Great JRPG Divide. Sabotage Studios' Canadians grew up immersed in the SNES JRPG golden age. Due to the cost of translating text-heavy scripts to multiple languages, Sandfall Interactive didn't. Europe, and other PAL regions like Australia, existed in a parallel timeline. If you didn’t have a chipped console and an import-savvy retailer you were out of luck. We didn't play Chrono Trigger and Earthbound on the SNES, we got them a decade later on the DS and Wii U. Our first Final Fantasy was number 7. Our first Dragon Quest was the cel-shaded eighth instalment on the PS2. Thanks to magazines, enthusiasts knew about these fabled videogames, but broader awareness was non-existent. Culturally we were cut adrift—like Clair Obscur's city of Lumiere, tragically separated from the mainland. Of course this meant when a wave of indie developers made nostalgic 16-bit JRPG homages, they came from North Americans inspired by the SNES JRPG canon we Europeans mostly missed. Californian Zeboyd Games made some pretty excellent retro JRPGs like Lovecraft parodyCthulhu Saves the Worldand space operaCosmic Star Heroinein the 2010s.Shadows of Adamin 2016 played Conan-esque fantasy reasonably straight, but some like Omocat's 2020 hikikomori horror RPGOmoripushed the genre towards its conceptual limits. WithThreads of Timein the works from a Toronto-based team, the North American 2D JRPG homages are far from over. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. French-speaking Europeans still left a mark on the 2D RPG scene, though. Thanks to its impressively easy-to-use nature, the 2D game engine RPG Maker had a strong Francophone community across both Canada and Europe in the mid 2000s. It's just that without the formative impact of 16-bit classics Chrono Trigger, Earthbound, Dragon Quest, and Final Fantasy 1–6, European 2D games followed a different evolutionary path. OFF, from the French-speaking Belgian team Unproductive Fun Time, became one of the French RPG Maker scene's biggest successes in 2008,even admired by Undertale’s Toby Fox. This fever dream of an RPG has an unusual cooldown-driven combat system, plus an eclectic set of influences including Killer 7's lurid fluorescent colour palette and Silent Hill 2's disturbing monster designs. With a remaster due later in 2025, it's another J'RPG to watch out for this year. A more recent RPG Maker example came out in 2023. Black-and-white timeloop RPGIn Stars and Timewas made by creator Adrienne Bazir, whose French upbringing shows. Chrono Trigger would usually be the obvious reference point for a 2D timeloop RPG, butBazir's influencesare instead Gamecube classic Tales of Symphonia, Undertale, and a game Nintendo denied both PAL and NTSC regions: Mother 3. The result, like OFF, is a true original, a moving and inventive experience, remixing the age-old ATB combat system devised by Mr Final Fantasy Hironobu Sakaguchi with an equipment system using memories from past runs. Clair Obscur's AA western take on the 3D JRPG stands out because it looks expensive in comparison. Recording every one of Gustave's gallic shrugs in motion capture doesn't come cheap, and presumably neither does his voice actor Charlie Cox. Perhaps another factor in its rarity is how Northern American developers gave the western JRPG a mixed reputation, with Ion Storm's enjoyably barmy 2001 effortAnachronoxand BioWare's biggest non-live service regretSonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhoodboth considered failures. For me, it's a point of pride that Europeans, locked out from much of JRPG history, were the ones to finally do the 3D era justice. Back in the '90s, it sucked being an JRPG fan in PAL regions. It felt like watching North America enjoy a party we weren't invited to. Decades later, those quirks of regional distribution are producing wonderfully distinctive takes on a classic genre. The Great JRPG Divide may be over, but its influence is still with us—even if we're still waiting for Xenogears to get that unbelievably overdue official release. Education comms and copywriter.

    "title": "Rematch: All the key details on the 5v5 football game from the masterminds behind Sifu",
    "article_text": "Rematch takes a fast-paced, screw-the-rules approach to football. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Sloclap is known for creating the Kung-Fu brawler Absolver, which was then followed up by a partnership with Kelper Interactive for another Kung-Fu brawler, Sifu. So, as you would expect, the next game from the studio is an online multiplayer five-a-side football showdown (that being real football, not whatever the Yanks play), called Rematch—Fifu was right there. Now, being the kid who was bad at sports (and thus always put in goals) but loved watching wrestling and kung fu movies, this felt like a bit of a betrayal. But Sloclap’s signature style and heaping helping of arcadey gameplay have me following a footy game with an interest I haven't had since Mario Strikers Charged launched for the Wii back in 2007. Not the Switch sequel, though; the less said about that one, the better. Rematch is making its way onto the pitch on June 19, 2025. However, the game also offers the dreaded “pay for a more expensive version to play early” option, so if you have some extra coffers to hand over, you can play it onJune 16, 2025.The game will release on Steam and the Xbox Store, while Xbox Game Pass subscribers can play day one. Rematch’s next and final beta test begins May 28, 2025, and runs through May 31, 2025 (5 am PT / 8 am ET / 12 pm GMT on both days). The beta’s first day was closed to players accepted into previous tests, but starting on May 29, everyone who requests access through theRematch Steampage will be let in. The latest Rematch trailer debuted during the Future Games Show at Gamescom Latam. It's a lesson on the “golden rules” of arcade football that also shows off a bunch of sick tekkers and other football terms I totally understand. Rematch is a five vs five online multiplayer football game, though instead of playing as a whole team, you’ll control one player on the pitch. There are no set positions; the goalie is whoever happens to be in the box at a given time. Plus, unlike FIFA, whatever Pro Evolution Soccer is called now, and EA FC, there are no stats to worry about; if you want to win, you’ll have to do so through sheer skill. While not as ridiculous as the likes of Rocket League or Mario Strikers, Rematch takes a more arcadey approach to football, with “no fouls, no offsides, no pauses… no time to rest.” And since you’re in an enclosed arena, you’ll be able to use the walls to your advantage, too. Maneuver around opponents by launching the ball at the barrier, then catch it on the rebound. It's rather effecient for being that asshole who doesn’t play as a team in team-based games—a win-win for everyone! Rematch will cost you $30 / £21 for the base game, with the ‘Pro Edition’ and ‘Elite Edition’ bumping that price up to $40 / £30 and $50 / £39, respectively. Both editions come with the 72-hour early access window, a number of cosmetics, and a “Captain’s Pass Upgrade Ticket” for the in-game battlepass (with the Elite version adding extra cosmetic items and a second upgrade ticket). Rematch's Captain Pass is just a battlepass, with the developers promising “Seasonal Content” on the game’s Steam page. So far, there's not much out there about what those passes entail, we don't know how much they'll cost or what's included. From beta footage, we can see it's mostly cosmetic items and the Blocks in-game currency, but it feels unlikely this is indicative of the real game since a majority of the rewards were currency. Despite the developer’s pedigree in top-tier scrapping games, Rematch does not appear to have any brawling. This is a football simulator, not an “average football fan” simulator. At a minimum, you can play Rematch with an RTX 1060 and i5-9400. The recommended setup calls for an Nvidia RTX 3050 and an Intel Core 11600k, so it’s not the most demanding game in the world. Couple that with an SSD and DirectX 12 Shader Model 5 support, and you're good to go. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

Returning to action after spending a month on the sidelines recovering from a shoulder injury, Hazlewood helped put Bengaluru on the cusp of a first IPL title with figures of 3-21 against Punjab Kings. Three-times runners-up Bengaluru bundled out Punjab for 101 and then chased down the target in 10 overs to book their place in Tuesday's final.

(File photo: Reuters/Tyrone Siu) HONG KONG: China signed a convention setting up an international organisation for mediation in Hong Kong on Friday (May 30) that Beijing hopes will be on par with the International Court of Justice and bolster the city's international credentials. The move comes amid growing geopolitical tensions that have been exacerbated by United States President Donald Trump's global trade war and fueled risks of a sharp worldwide economic downturn. Escalating trade tensions between China and the US have been a focal point for investors and markets in recent months, with the trade war leading to significant impacts on global commerce and supply chains. The mediation body aims to cement Hong Kong's presence as a top centre to resolve disputes between countries, leader John Lee said earlier this week, adding that its status would be on par with the International Court of Justice and the Permanent Court of Arbitration of the United Nations in The Hague.

Indonesia, Pakistan, Laos, Cambodia and Serbia were among the countries attending the signing ceremony. Representatives from 20 international bodies, including the UN, were also expected to join, public broadcaster RTHK said. A video shown at the signing, which was presided by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, said the scope of cases that would be handled include disputes between countries, between a country and nationals of another country and between private international entities. The mediation group could advance China's influence internationally and promote a more assertive role for the world's second-largest economy in global governance, some analysts said. Hong Kong's Justice Secretary Paul Lam said that the new body would help Hong Kong cope with challenges that arise when \"hostile external forces are attempting to de-internationalise and de-functionalise\" the city. Hong Kong tied with Singapore for second place, behind London, as the top choice for a seat of arbitration in 2025, according to the 2025 International Arbitration Survey conducted by Queen Mary University of London. The new organisation's headquarters will be located at a former police station in the bustling Wan Chai district, and is due to open by the end of this year or early 2026.

    "article_text": "World World An Israeli tank is used in Gaza, near the Israel-Gaza border, as seen from Israel, May 29, 2025. (Photo: REUTERS/Amir Cohen) A US plan for Gaza seen by Reuters on Friday (May 30), proposes a 60-day ceasefire and the release of 28 Israeli hostages, alive and dead, in the first week and the release of 125 Palestinian prisoners sentenced to life and the remains of 180 dead Palestinians. The plan, which says it is guaranteed by US President Donald Trump and mediators Egypt and Qatar, includes sending aid to Gaza as soon as Hamas signs off on the ceasefire agreement. The plan stipulates that Hamas will release the last 30 hostages once a permanent ceasefire is in place. The White House said on Thursday thatIsrael has agreed to the US ceasefire proposal. The Palestinian militant group Hamas told Reuters it was reviewing the plan and will respond on Friday or Saturday. Deep differences between Hamas and Israel have stymied previous attempts to restore a ceasefire that broke down in March. Israel has insisted that Hamas disarm completely and be dismantled as a military and governing force, and that all 58 hostages still held in Gaza must be returned before it will agree to end the war. Hamas has rejected the demand to give up its weapons and says Israel must pull its troops out of Gaza and commit to ending the war. Israel launched its campaign in Gaza in response to the devastating Hamas attack in southern Israel on Oct 7, 2023, that killed some 1,200 people and saw 251 Israelis taken hostage into Gaza, according to Israeli tallies. The subsequent Israeli military campaign has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians, Gaza health officials say, and left the enclave in ruins.

REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha/File Photo BANGKOK :Thailand's manufacturing production index unexpectedly rose 2.17 per cent in April from a year earlier on gains in manufacturing, exports of industrial goods and tourism, the industry ministry said on Friday. But output was still down 0.75 per cent over the first four months of 2025 from a year earlier, and the ministry cut its 2025 forecast range to growth of 0 per cent to 1 per cent from 1.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. April's rise compared with a forecast annual fall of 2.95 per cent in a Reuters poll. March's outcome was revised to a rise of just 0.05 per cent from an initially reported annual fall of 0.66 per cent. Figures earlier this week showed exports rose by an annual 10.2 per cent in April, though the commerce ministry said the outlook was challenging because of U.S. tariffs. Thailand is among Southeast Asian nations hardest hit by U.S. President Donald Trump's measures, with a 36 per cent tariff if a reduction can't be negotiated before a moratorium ends in July. Car production in Thailand, a regional automaking centre, fell in April for the 21st straight month, down 0.4 per cent on a yearly basis, data last week showed.

    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Singapore Entertainment Women People Women Women Wellness Women Wellness Wellness Living Singapore Singapore Living Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Dining Dining Dining Dining Singapore Experiences Experiences Travel Entertainment Entertainment They must have taken the long-suffering theme of the drama too seriously. When Life Gives You Tangerines debuted in March 2025. (Photo: Netflix) This audio is generated by an AI tool. Netflix’sWhen Life Gives You Tangerines, which follows the lives of a lovestruck couple across 50 years, is one of the most talked-about K-dramas so far this year. Starring IU and Park Bo-gum, the tearjerker has earned rave reviews from audiences and critics across the globe and catapulted several supporting actors and child stars to fame. The drama recently made headlines again but this time for its harsh working conditions on set. Earlier this week, a netizen, who claims to have worked on the show, took to X (formerly Twitter) to accuse the production team of mistreating extras and crew. Recounting an incident on set, the person wrote: “Someone used spray paint from a hardware store to spray on a rented bus. When caught, they brushed it off, saying, ‘Just use paint remover to wipe it off.’ They got scolded severely after that.” Netflix has since made a statement on Thursday (May 29) to say that it is “reviewing the matter”, reported Korea JoongAng Daily. The streamer said: “Netflix continues to work with its Korean production partners to foster a better environment. We are currently verifying the facts surrounding the incident and will thoroughly review the matter to prevent similar cases from happening again.” Other users have also shared their experiences working on the show. One person claimed that the When Life Gives You Tangerines production team had a notorious reputation among extras. “It’s the one job everyone tried to avoid,” said the user. Although the drama is a Netflix-funded original, the netizen said they “didn’t provide even the most basic support”. “Other than the main cast, the production was unwilling to spend money on anyone else. It was all about penny-pinching,” the netizen wrote. This person went to describe some of the gruelling filming conditions which included making elderly actors wait outside in the freezing cold for long hours. “There was no tea station or meal truck–people had to find their own food at nearby restaurants and were told to finish eating within 30 minutes,” the netizen added. The costume department was also criticised for dressing extras in super thin winter clothes and prohibiting them from wearing anything underneath, even thermal underwear. The reason? It would ruin the silhouette. “Who even notices what background actors are wearing? This is modern-day slavery!” said the user. One especially disturbing incident occurred during heavy snowfall. As everyone waited in the cold, there was no heating until one actor took the initiative to lead people to a nearby stove for warmth. The user also claimed that crew forced extras to shave their heads because “wigs are too hard to put on”. “There was zero room for flexibility. I don’t understand what kind of money they were trying to save,” they said. This story was originallypublishedin 8Days. For more 8Days stories, visithttps://www.8days.sg/ Copyright© Mediacorp 2025.

    "title": "An app to 'talk' to a kebaya? Peranakan Museum partners with OpenAI to let you do just that",
    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Women People Women Women Wellness Women Wellness Wellness Living Singapore Singapore Living Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Dining Dining Dining Dining Singapore Experiences Experiences Travel Singapore Singapore CNA Lifestyle spoke with the Peranakan Museum, OpenAI and Ask Mona – a French AI studio focused on enhancing cultural experiences with artificial intelligence – about the pilot collaboration in an exclusive interview. The traditional Peranakan kebaya is an artefact people can have a conversation with, as part of the pilot collaboration between Peranakan Museum and OpenAI. (Photo: OpenAI) This audio is generated by an AI tool. Museum visits can be semi-intimidating. You listen to a passionate docent tell you about an artefact’s rich history. Then at the end of the tour, they ask: Any questions? You have several. Why is a vase pink? Why does the man look so sad in the photograph? Why do these people have their portrait displayed in a museum? But of course, you don’t ask. Because you don’t want to come off stupid. Instead, you ask how the artefact influenced a certain ethic group’s identity in modern day. It makes you sound well-informed, you believe. But a museum visit should encourage curiosity, not stem it. And it’s this belief that forms the basis of artificial intelligence (AI) organisation OpenAI’s first museum partnership in Asia with Singapore’s Peranakan Museum, announced at the OpenAI Forum during tech event ATxSummit on Thursday (May 29). The pilot collaboration with Ask Mona – a French AI studio that uses an OpenAI large language model to enhance cultural experiences – will allow visitors to “speak” with certain museum artefacts via AI-generated conversations on Ask Mona’s web app, accessible on any mobile device.It will be available till Jul 6. Selected artefacts include traditional Peranakan attire, a kamcheng jar (a type of porcelain storage jar that’s often decorated) and several pictures depicting various aspects and key personalities of Peranakan culture. For instance, with the kebaya, I posed Ask Mona a question one may hesitate to ask out loud: “Why does a kebaya look so uncomfortable to wear?” Its response, generated after a few seconds, read: “The kebaya might seem uncomfortable due to its form-fitting design. This style became popular in the 1930s. “The kebaya is often made with translucent European fabrics. These fabrics can appear delicate and restrictive. Historically, it was a loose-fitting garment, evolving over time. Its design reflects a blend of cultural influences, making it unique. “The kebaya is paired with a sarong or kain panjang, adding to its elegance.” This AI technology, to be clear, isn’t the same as having a digital screen display information about an exhibit or listening to an audio narration about an artefact’s history. Such methods remain helpful in engaging museum goers. But they can “feel like a one-way conversation”, said Lum Jia Yi, assistant director of audience, communications and digital at the Peranakan Museum. “With Ask Mona, audiences get to ask their questions. And we get to find out their train of thought (that) helps us shape what audiences are trying to find out about the collections, and (understand) how we can present our materials better.” Ultimately, the museum aims to make its collections and culture “more accessible to the general audience”, not least since the Peranakan culture is a “living, breathing culture that’s constantly evolving”, Lum added. And since audiences are constantly on their phone, the AI technology simply allows them to interact with the museum “in a way that they are comfortable with”. While ATxSummit attendees got to see the initiative up close alongside the artefacts, which were brought to the summit, the experience isn't currently available at the Peranakan Museum itself. Non-attendees can access the experience by joining the OpenAI Forum community at forum.openai.com, where they will receive a link to the Ask Mona web app. They can then \"speak\" with the various Peranakan Museum artefacts listed in the app - from anywhere in the world. On one hand, such experiences make museums more accessible, allowing anyone the opportunity to learn about other cultures at their own pace - and without the fear of judgement.Understandably, this may then beg the question: Will AI eventually replace the need for human docents? In short, no, said CEO and co-founder of Ask Mona, Marion Carre. Not only does she believe we need to move beyond the classic opposition of human versus AI, she has also observed that most people use such AI technology to start conversations with friends and family about their museum experience. Some museums have even told Carre that people used to look at artwork for three to five seconds on average – but with the likes of Ask Mona, they now spend three to five minutes interacting with an artwork. “We’re really about using AI to improve the museum experience globally,” she told CNA Lifestyle. Her team also ensures that all data fed into OpenAI's large language model used by Ask Mona strictly comes from the museum, which means anticipating the questions visitors may actually have at each exhibit. Crucially, the partnership reveals the possibilities of using AI beyond the typical spaces of the classroom and the workplace. What’s not often explored is the impact that AI can have to “bring people closer to culture and heritage”, said Sandy Kunvatanagarn, head of Asia-Pacific policy at OpenAI. “Inspired by that and the fact that this year is SG60, we thought it’d be a perfect opportunity to really see how we can use AI technology and the Peranakan Museum’s focus on accessibility and community – and combine that with the work that Ask Mona has been doing around the world – to bring everybody together to have a conversation about the richness of Peranakan culture. “Not just in Singapore, but through the web app (which gives people) the ability to access it all around the world.” OpenAI believes AI has the power to change many aspects of life, Kunvatanagarn added, “but one thing that is consistent, and that should be for everybody, is culture and understanding their own heritage”. “If AI can play a part in language preservation or cultural accessibility, or whatever it is that people want to learn about who they are, we think there’s a place for AI to be in that. And it’s done by working with partners who are experts in this space, and us providing the tools to make it happen.” Access the experience by joining the OpenAI Forum community atforum.openai.com.

    "article_text": "Business Business A woman walks in front of a stock quotation board inside a building in Tokyo, Japan on Apr 25, 2025. (Photo: Reuters/Issei Kato) HONG KONG: Asian shares fell Friday (May 30) after a US appeal court gave Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs a temporary reprieve, fanning uncertainty a day after judges had ruled the controversial measures were unconstitutional. The losses reversed a rally across world markets the previous day as analysts warned that the legal wrangling could compound volatility and throw trade talks between Washington and other governments. While the tariffs have been stalled and are set to go through the courts - and possibly end up at the Supreme Court - there are expectations that the US president will find other means to implement them. The US Court of International Trade's ruling on Wednesday barred most of the tariffs announced since Trump took office, ruling that he had overstepped his authority - a decision he labelled \"horrible\" and should be \"quickly and decisively\" reversed for good.

Disappointing readings on jobless benefits and pending home sales added to the more downbeat mood, with investors also on edge over elevated bond yields and Trump's plans to ramp up the budget deficit. On currency markets, the yen strengthened after figures showed inflation in Tokyo - a barometer for the rest of Japan - came in above forecasts this month, ramping up expectations the country's central bank will hike interest rates in July.

    "title": "Shein working towards Hong Kong listing after London IPO stalls: Sources",
    "article_text": "Business Business Shein plans to go public in the Asian financial hub within the year, said two sources. An employee at the Shein Holiday pop-up shop inside Times Square's Forever 21 in New York City, US, on Nov 10, 2023. (File photo: Reuters/David \"Dee\" Delgado) HONG KONG: Shein is working towards a listing in Hong Kong after the online fast-fashion retailer's proposed initial public offering (IPO) in London failed to secure the green light from Chinese regulators, said three sources with knowledge of the matter. The China-founded company aims to file a draft prospectus with Hong Kong's stock exchange in the coming weeks, one of the sources said. Shein plans to go public in the Asian financial hub within the year, two of the sources said. Shein plans to change the listing venue as it has not yet received approval for its London IPO from Chinese regulators, notably the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), the two sources said. The company, which sells products including US$5 bike shorts and US$18 sundresses, in March secured approval from Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for its IPO in London, and soon informed the CSRC, one of the sources said.

By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive news updates and promotional material from Mediacorp and Mediacorp’s partners.LoadingThe company initially expected the green light from Chinese regulators to follow swiftly after the FCA but has since experienced an unexpected delay and limited communication from the CSRC, said the source. The company initially expected the green light from Chinese regulators to follow swiftly after the FCA but has since experienced an unexpected delay and limited communication from the CSRC, said the source. Details about Shein's Hong Kong listing plan have not been reported previously. All the sources spoke to Reuters on the condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media. Shein and CSRC did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment. A spokesperson for Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HKEX) declined to comment on individual companies. Before its attempt to list in London, Shein had pursued a listing in New York, as part of its efforts to gain legitimacy as a global, rather than a Chinese company, and access to a wide pool of large Western investors. A listing in Hong Kong would go against that strategy and could hurt its global credentials. Allegations that Shein's products contain cotton from China's Xinjiang region and a planned legal challenge to the London IPO by a non-governmental organisation campaigning against forced labour in China have complicated the London listing and risk embarrassment for the Chinese government, a separate source with direct knowledge of the matter said. Tensions with the US over trade only exacerbate the wariness of Beijing and the CSRC, the source said. The US and non-governmental organisations accuse China of human rights abuses in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, where they say Uyghur people are forced to work producing cotton and other goods. Beijing has denied any abuses. Shein, founded by China-born entrepreneur Sky Xu, says it has a zero tolerance policy for forced labour and child labour in its supply chain. The company moved its headquarters from Nanjing, China, to Singapore in 2022. As it awaited a response from the CSRC, Shein earlier this month dropped the communications firms Brunswick and FGS it had hired to help with public relations ahead of the London listing. Reuters could not determine if Shein had sought or received a nod from the CSRC for the Hong Kong listing. The company had sought Chinese regulatory approval to go ahead with processes to list in New York and later in London. Shein's filings with the CSRC make it subject to Beijing's listing rules for Chinese firms going public offshore, two sources have said. The rules are applied on \"a substance over form\" basis, giving the CSRC discretion on when and how to implement them, the sources added. Shein does not own or operate any factories, instead sourcing its products from 7,000 third-party suppliers in China as well as some factories in other countries like Brazil and Türkiye. The company had aimed to go public in London in the first half of this year. \"Shein's listing would have been a boost to the market,\" said Alasdair Steele, corporate partner with law firm CMS. \"However, there was never any guarantee that a single large listing would reignite the IPO market.\" \"The Shein news is much more to do with China than London,\" said Lisa Gordon, chair of investment bank Cavendish and a member of the Capital Markets Industry Taskforce (CMIT) - a group dedicated to the revival of Britain's markets. \"The London market is in a very good position.\" This is not the United Kingdom capital’s first major IPO loss this year. In February, Unilever said it had chosen Amsterdam for the main listing of its ice cream business. That follows a string of London-listed companies moving, such as online betting company Flutter. Others, such as Shell, are considering leaving as well. Shein’s business model of sending products straight from factories to shoppers around the world was disrupted by the Trump administration ending duty-free access and slapping steep tariffs on e-commerce packages from China. The \"de minimis\" exemption allowed e-commerce packages from China worth less than US$800 to enter the US duty-free and helped Shein, Temu and Amazon Haul sell clothes, gadgets and accessories extremely cheaply. Now, those parcels are subject to a minimum tariff of 30 per cent. Regardless of where Shein lists, its eventual IPO valuation will hinge on the impact of the removal of the de minimis exemption, the sources have said. The US exemption is still in place for goods that are not from China or Hong Kong. The European Union has also proposed changes to its duty exemption on parcels under €150, adding to pressure on the business model. Reuters reported in February that Shein was set to cut its valuation in a potential London listing to around US$50 billion, nearly a quarter less than the US$66 billion valuation it had achieved in a US$2 billion private fundraising in 2023. A revival in Hong Kong's capital market, with sizable recent listings including Chinese electric vehicle battery giant CATL's US$5.3 billion float, the world's largest listing this year, augurs well for a potential Shein IPO in the city. Companies have raised US$9.7 billion in Hong Kong through IPOs and second listings so far in 2025, compared to US$1.05 billion at the same time last year, according to LSEG data.

That's not common, and he moves really well on the court.\" Monfils said he had seen other improvements in Draper over the last few years. \"Where he's really progressed is that he really returns really well,\" he added. \"He's far from the baseline, and the ball's always in at the right speed, the right course, and he's made a tremendous amount of progress in that regard. \"So a Jack who is feeling very self-confident like that is very difficult to manoeuvre.\" On a day when compatriot Richard Gasquet was ushered into retirement, Monfils said he would definitely be back next year for a 19th tilt at the title at his home Grand Slam. \"I think it's really hard to stop playing at Roland,\" he said. \"It's hard, because generally when you stop, it's because you're not up to the level.\" (Writing by Nick Mulvenney; Editing by Peter Rutherford) Subscribe to CNA's Recommended Read A single handpicked story that we think you shouldn't miss.

    "title": "Singapore to pilot nationwide trial referring non-life-threatening 995 calls to medical triage helpline",
    "article_text": "Singapore Singapore Demand for emergency medical services has been \"increasingly rapidly\" over the years, say the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Health. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Non-life-threatening 995 calls will be referred to a medical triage helpline in a nationwide trial from Jun 1, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Friday (May 30). The helpline, known as NurseFirst, is operated by Woodlands Health. It will provide medical advice on a caller’s medical condition and guide callers to appropriate medical care options. The pilot by Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) and Woodlands Health will enable SCDF to prioritise emergency medical response to those facing life-threatening emergencies, the ministries said in a joint press release. It would also help public hospital emergency departments to focus their resources on patients who require urgent medical care. NurseFirst started as a medical triage helpline pilot on Feb 4, 2022, to manage non-life-threatening cases in the northern district. As an expansion of the pilot, the NurseFirst helpline will widen its coverage to serve callers islandwide for six months. SCDF and Woodlands Health will monitor the helpline's impact and effectiveness to \"assess its potential for extension\". The demand for emergency medical services (EMS) has been \"increasing rapidly\" over the years, MOH and MHA said. The SCDF responded to 245,279 EMS calls in 2024. This worked out to an average of 672 calls per day – a 57 per cent increase from 2014. \"With Singapore’s ageing population and rising healthcare needs, EMS calls are expected to continue increasing,\" said the ministries. When a 995 call is assessed to be non-life-threatening, SCDF’s Operations Centre will transfer the caller to the NurseFirst helpline for further assistance. Trained nurses, with medical oversight from emergency medicine physicians, will assess callers based on their symptoms and advise those with non-life-threatening conditions on the appropriate alternative care options nearest to them. The caller may be directed to an alternative care provider, such as a general practitioner. Other follow-up actions could include advising the person to call for a non-emergency ambulance, as well as other self-care steps. \"Before transferring the call, the SCDF call-taker will share key patient details with the nurse at NurseFirst. This ensures a seamless transition for the caller,\" said the ministries. \"At any time during the call with the nurse at NurseFirst, if the patient’s condition deteriorates, SCDF will be immediately notified to dispatch an ambulance.\" The NurseFirst pilot will operate from 8am to 11pm daily. Outside of these hours, SCDF will deal with non-life-threatening 995 calls according to its current protocols. The public can also call the NurseFirst helpline directly at 6262 6262 for non-life-threatening medical conditions to receive timely medical advice at no cost. Non-life-threatening conditions include animal bites without allergic symptoms and without active bleeding, minor burns affecting less than 15 per cent of the body surface area, and resolved choking episodes without active symptoms, among others. \"SCDF has been exploring linking up with a triage helpline that can assess the individual’s condition and redirect non-life-threatening cases to alternative care options,\" said MHA and MOH. \"This will enable SCDF to reduce conveyances to emergency departments, and focus SCDF and hospitals’ resources on life-threatening cases, such as patients experiencing cardiac arrest or severe breathing difficulties.\" Similar helplines are also in use in various countries, including the UK, Japan, Denmark and Finland, the ministries said. SCDF has progressively rolled out various initiatives to actively manage the increase in EMS calls over the years, MOH and MHA said. This ensures emergency ambulances are available to serve those in critical need. In June 2009, SCDF started engaging private ambulance operators to augment its fleet of ambulances. About four years later, it introduced the emergency medical technicians scheme so that fire and rescue specialists are cross-trained to respond to medical emergencies as well. In April 2017, it introduced a tiered response framework, where the scale of resources dispatched and the response speed were calibrated to the seriousness of each call. It also implemented medical call triaging by 995 call-takers using the Advanced Medical Protocol System. This system is used by SCDF to triage calls based on their severity, by asking specific questions about the patient’s conditions to determine the appropriate level of response. SCDF also introduced a non-conveyance policy in April 2019. A patient who is assessed to be a non-emergency case by paramedics at the scene will not be taken to hospital. In March 2023, the force started a non-dispatch policy, where ambulances are dispatched only when the call is assessed to be an actual emergency. Last July, SCDF said a slightly longer response time of up to 20 minutes can be expected if a call is assessed to be of a lower acuity. This will allow SCDF to further prioritise emergency ambulances for higher acuity and life-threatening emergencies that require immediate medical attention.

It ended its first day of trading at RM1.20, above the IPO price of 1.13 per share, making its founder Lee a billionaire. The successful IPO highlighted the strength and potential of a business model offering consumers affordability amid economic uncertainty, analysts said. \"Because everybody wants to save money, dollar stores are generally seen as recession-proof. That's where people go, especially those in the low-income (B40) and some in the middle-income (M40) bracket,\" said Vincent Lau, equities broker Rakuten Trade’s head of equity sales.CNA takes a closer look at the rise of value chain stores in Malaysia and elsewhere, as well as what could curb their growth. Starting with one RM2 store in the town of Gemas in Negeri Sembilan, Eco-Shop has grown to become Malaysia's leading dollar store chain and currently has 358 outlets across the country. In its prospectus, it said it plans to add an average of 70 new stores annually for the next five years. The company is worth about RM6.67 billion after its listing. The vast majority of its more than 10,000 items each cost RM2.60 in Peninsular Malaysia and RM2.80 in East Malaysia. Eco-Shop has also launched 22 Eco-Plus format stores featuring a wider range of products at various prices.Its net profit has risen from RM27.09 million in 2022, to RM105.07 million in 2023 and RM177.28 million last year. While Eco-Shop is the biggest dollar store player in Malaysia and commands almost 70 per cent market share, there are several other players such as Ninso and Eko Jimat. Ninso originated in Kluang, Johor in 2017, and now has 99 outlets across the country. Eko Jimat has 72 stores, while Japanese chain Daiso, whose items are mostly RM5.90 each, has 70 stores. NT Shop has 36 stores, while Setia has 34 stores. Predominantly located on individual shoplots, some of these stores have also set up in malls. According to a market research report by consulting firm Frost & Sullivan for Eco-Shop’s IPO, the dollar store-based retail segment in Malaysia has experienced significant sales growth from around RM1 billion in 2016 to RM4 billion in 2024. While their popularity may not be surprising to some, others have found it remarkable. \"I'm actually quite surprised at how big the dollar store trend has gotten,” said Mydin Hypermarket founder and managing director Ameer Ali Mydin, who has 70 branches in Malaysia. With the ringgit weakening over the years and one American dollar now equivalent to RM4.25, “you kind of think, 'What can you really buy for RM2.60?”, Ameer said. “But they seem to have enough things to keep people coming back,\" he said, adding that he does not intend to enter the fray as he did not want to spread his business thinly. A walk through the Eco-Shop and Ninso branches in Selayang reveals no shortage of items ranging from the practical to the whimsical at the RM2.60 price point. Besides plastic containers, file covers, a pack of 80 baby wipes, 500ml hand wash, shampoo, flower pots and tools such as spanners and sets of allen-keys, there are also toys and capybara-themed hairbands. The shops also sell food items such as biscuits, chocolates and snacks. Frost & Sullivan's report indicated further growth potential, noting that as of last year, the sector in Malaysia had a penetration rate of 23 stores per million population. The rate is low compared to more mature markets such as Japan, which has 87 stores per million population, the United States with 119 stores per million population, and Canada with 127 stores per million population. The report estimated that the penetration rate of dollar stores within Malaysia is 1.5 per cent of the sales value of the store-based retail sector. Sales in Malaysia's dollar store industry are projected to reach RM7.8 billion by the end of 2029, it stated, up 95 per cent from 2024’s RM4 billion. “These stores have proven to be recession-proof, offering affordable options during economic downturns and high inflation rates,” Frost & Sullivan wrote. “By providing a range of homogeneous goods at fixed prices, dollar stores attract new customers who would typically shop at higher-priced retailers, especially during times of economic uncertainty,” it said. The concept also exists in other Southeast Asian nations like Singapore, with stores such as Valu$, and Thailand where there are 20-baht shops. In Japan, meanwhile, 100-yen shops have become a fixture in the retail landscape. Eco-Shop’s chief executive Jessica Ng told CNA that the fixed-price retail model has gained global traction, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty. “In Malaysia, we have seen growing demand for value-retailing, driven by rising cost-of-living concerns and increasing consumer awareness of smart spending,” she said via email. “Notably, value retail has become more mainstream, attracting not just lower-income shoppers but also middle-income households looking for everyday essentials at affordable prices,” she said. Eco-Shop’s business model tends to be countercyclical – during inflationary periods or economic slowdowns, consumers become more price-sensitive, which tends to drive more traffic to fixed-price retailers, she added. Malaysia's headline inflation was 1.8 per cent in 2024, lower than the 2.5 per cent in 2023. This year, headline inflation is expected to be between 2 and 3.5 per cent. What is the secret behind these dollar stores' ability to sell products relatively cheaply? Economist Yeah Kim Leng, while surprised at the variety of items on sale for less than the price of a coffee, attributed it to the bulk purchasing ability of dollar stores. Ng of Eco-Shop said its business model is built on high volume and scale – products are bought in bulk, so the company is able to sell them cheaply. The fixed-price model boils down to scale, efficiency and strategic sourcing, she said. “Our sourcing strategy is very deliberate. We’ve built strong, long-term relationships with suppliers from Malaysia and different parts of the world,” she said. “Over the years, we’ve also established direct factory relationships, which helps us get better pricing and avoid middleman costs.” Dollar stores are not immune to price pressures and other challenges, however. Just last month, Eco-Shop and Ninso hiked their prices from RM2.40 to RM2.60. According to analyst reports, such stores are also labour-intensive and dependent on both foreign labour and suppliers. Ng said key challenges range from managing rising costs from supply chain disruptions and foreign exchange fluctuations, to higher freight and logistics expenses. Its draw lies not only in affordability, but also variety, Ng added. Which is why each Eco-Shop outlet offers 5,000 to 11,000 items. “Whether it’s homeware, personal care, snacks, or stationery, we make it a point to keep our product assortment fresh and relevant so that every trip to the store feels like there’s something new to discover,” she said. While Yeah noted there is competition from other brick-and-mortar stores as well as the global online marketplace – Chinese e-commerce giant Taobao launched a Malay-language interface that automates translation across the platform this week, for instance – dollar stores enable customers to “have a feel” of the items on offer. “That is why these stores can do well,” he said. And while customers appreciate the affordability and range of items at value stores, some are mindful of impulse purchases while others say they would visit other shops and pay more for certain items. Mary Agnes, 50, from Batu Caves, told CNA nearly half of her purchases from monthly visits to Eco-Shop are unintended – a behaviour Frost & Sullivan’s report terms “treasure hunting”. “The perception of getting a good deal can drive impulse buys, even for things people might not need,” Mary acknowledged. Mechanic Hazri Mukeri, 45, who is from Selayang, said that while stores such as Ninso and Eco-Shop are useful for small items such as plastic containers, he would be pickier when it comes to tools needed for work. “Of course, you can purchase some things such as cable ties (here) but when it comes to tools such as spanners, the items sold would not last as long as those pricier products found in proper hardware stores, for example,” he said.

    "article_text": "Brand Studio SIMPLIFYING AI DEPLOYMENTFOR SUSTAINABLE GROWTH Hewlett Packard Enterprise helps businesses harness and scale AI’s potential by seamlessly integrating infrastructure and software. The artificial intelligence (AI) race is gaining momentum, with global enterprises projected to investup to S$26.2 trillion in AI adoption between 2024 and 2030. According to Mr Ridhav Mahajan, director of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (Asia Pacific), successful AI deployment enables enterprises to stay agile and respond quickly to evolving market demands. “Besides enhancing effciency and reducing costs, AI can help unlock strategic growth across an enterprise over the long term,” he said. NAVIGATING THE CHALLENGES OF AI DEPLOYMENT Despite the urgency of scaling enterprise AI, the road to successful deployment is paved with obstacles that must first be addressed. The complexity of integrating diverse AI tools and the need for effective data management are key barriers, noted Mr Mahajan. “Challenges include data silos, lack of standardisation, skill gaps, scalability issues and security concerns,” he said. “These are further compounded by intricate AI workflows, rapidly evolving technologies, difficulties in integration with legacy systems, and the diversity of data sources.” He cited the example of a customer who spent over a year procuring and integrating essential AI components, such as infrastructure, storage, Kubernetes (an open-source system that manages containerised applications) and open-source generative AI tools. Such time-consuming delays can be avoided with turnkey solutions that are pre-integrated and ready for immediate use. These solutions enable enterprises to unlock AI’s transformative potential without being burdened by technical complexities. HPE is committed to helping businesses realise real value from AI deployment beyond the hype, says Mr Ridhav Mahajan, director of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (Asia Pacific). Video: Ecosystm AI-READY DATA, WHEREVER IT RESIDES Simplifying the complexities of deploying and scaling enterprise AI solutions requires accessible, AI-ready data and high-performing data architecture. Poorly structured data pipelines slow development cycles, reduce model accuracy and lower developer productivity due to the need for extensive manual intervention. Fragmented data environments further exacerbate these challenges by creating silos that hinder integration, analytics and insights. HPE Ezmeral Data Fabricoffers a unified data plane that enables seamless integration and access across diverse environments. “The solution’s scalability also ensures that enterprises can handle growing data volumes and complex workflows without compromising performance or agility,” said Mr Mahajan. Particularly effective in fast-paced, data-intensive environments, HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric can shape high volumes of public and proprietary data across multi-generation IT infrastructures while maintaining data consistency. A healthcare provider that used HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric to unify disparate patient records cut AI model training time by 40 per cent, in turn enabling faster and more accurate diagnostics. Another key element of HPE’s AI toolbox isHPE GreenLake for File Storage, which offers scalable, high-performance storage for AI workloads. “HPE GreenLake for File Storage provides low-latency storage capable of managing the vast datasets required for AI training and inference,” said Mr Mahajan. “Seamlessly integrated withHPE Private Cloud AI, it ensures the efficient training and deployment of models.” HPE embeds security protocols, transparency and ethical AI practices in all its solutions. These principles ensure that enterprises can responsibly deploy AI. To meet compliance requirements, HPE provides governance frameworks that allow enterprises to retain full control and ownership of their data. Partnerships with regulators and industry experts further reinforce trust and accountability. HPE’s modular, scalable architectures are designed to evolve alongside technological advancements. Collaborations with leading tech peers like NVIDIA enable HPE to deliver solutions that meet the growing and diverse needs of enterprises. FULL-STACK, TURNKEY PRIVATE CLOUD FOR AI Developed in partnership with multinational technology company NVIDIA,HPE Private Cloud AIis a comprehensive, one-stop solution designed to simplify AI deployment, mitigate risks and boost time-to-market, all while keeping proprietary data and intellectual property private and secure. Ready for immediate use, HPE Private Cloud AI can be deployed by HPE in an organisation’s preferred environment in just a few hours. Additionally, this solution enables the rapid deployment of popular generative AI applications such as pre-built digital assistants, in under 30 seconds. With HPE Private Cloud AI, businesses can deploy virtual assistants capable of delivering accurate, real-time responses without compromising security or scalability. For instance, financial institutions can quickly implement digital assistants to streamline customer support, enhance engagement and reduce operational costs, all while ensuring data compliance. FUTURE-READY FROM DAY ONE According to Mr Mahajan, enterprises new to AI should focus on defining clear objectives and selecting manageable, high-impact use cases. HPE Private Cloud AI simplifies this process with its integrated environment and pre-configured components, expediting adoption while minimising risks. For enterprises looking to scale AI solutions, success depends on optimising infrastructure, ensuring data access and addressing operational challenges such as governance and compliance. At this stage of the AI journey, pre-integrated tools like HPE AI Essentials and NVIDIA AI Enterprise enable the deployment of advanced use cases, including generative AI and retrieval-augmented generation – a technique that connects generative AI models to external resources, enhancing their reliability and accuracy. “As an end-to-end solution, HPE Private Cloud AI enables businesses to unify their data workflows, streamline model development and remain agile as their needs evolve. This empowers them to focus on achieving tangible business outcomes, driving efficiency and scaling innovation with confidence,” said Mr Mahajan. Copyright© Mediacorp 2025. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

(File Photo: Reuters/Olivia Harris) NEW YORK:Former Goldman Sachs banker Tim Leissnerwas sentenced to two years in prison by a judge in a New York court on Thursday (May 29) after playing a key role in a multi-billion dollar scandal involving Malaysia's sovereign fund 1MDB. Malaysian and US authorities estimated US$4.5 billion was stolen from 1MDB in an elaborate scheme that spanned the globe and implicated high-level officials in the fund,former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, Goldman executives and others. Leissner, a former Southeast Asia chairman for Goldman, pleaded guilty in 2018 to a conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and participating in a money laundering conspiracy, all tied to his role in the 1MDB scandal. Leissner's conduct was \"brazen and audacious\", judge Margo Brodie said during sentencing.

Prosecutors requested the court impose a sentence below the applicable guidelines range due to Leissner's cooperation in the probe. Leissner told the court that he had lost his freedom, family and financial independence in the wake of the scandal. The former executive said his health also suffered, and that he took pills and lost the will to live. Goldman said in a letter to the court on May 21 that Leissner deceived his colleagues for years, culminating in the only criminal case filed against Goldman in its 156-year history. Goldman in 2020 paid a record US$2.9 billion fine in the United States and arranged for its Malaysian unit to plead guilty in US court. It also clawed back US$174 million in executive compensation. Malaysia's former prime minister Najib was found guilty in 2020 of criminal breach of trust and abuse of power for illegally receiving funds misappropriated from a unit of state investor 1Malaysia Development Berhad. Malaysia's top court in 2022 upheld a guilty verdict against Najib, sentencing him to 12 years in prison. Thesentence was later halved by a pardons boardchaired by Malaysia's former king. The former premier is currently in prison and is pursuing a legal bid to compel authorities to entitle him to serve the remainder of his sentence at home.

    "title": "Oil prices set for weekly drop with tariff legal battles, OPEC+ in focus",
    "article_text": "Business Business A pump jack operates near a crude oil reserve in the Permian Basin oil field near Midland, Texas, U.S. February 18, 2025.  REUTERS/Eli Hartman/File Photo BEIJING :     Oil prices were on track to end the week down more than 1 per cent on Friday amid whipsawing tariff rulings in the U.S. and as the market braced for a potential OPEC+ output hike. Brent crude futures slipped 26 cents, or 0.41 per cent, to $63.89 a barrel by 0104 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell 27 cents, or 0.44 per cent, to $60.67 a barrel. The Brent July futures contract is due to expire on Friday. In the U.S., President Donald Trump's tariffs were to remain in effect after a federal appeals court temporarily reinstated them on Thursday, reversing a trade court's decision on Wednesday to put an immediate block on the most sweeping of the duties. The block had sent oil prices falling more than 1 per cent on Thursday as traders weighed its effects. Analysts said uncertainty would remain as the tariff battles worked their way through the court system.

    "title": "And Just Like That… Miranda Rebounds From Che Diaz With a Virgin Nun",
    "article_text": "In the first season ofSex and the City,Cynthia Nixon’sMiranda dates a Catholic guy who insists on taking an immediate post-coital shower to wash away the sins of their carnal relations. By season three, her housekeeper Magda (Lynn Cohen) places a Virgin Mary statuette in the nightstand where her vibrator once rested. But nothing could have prepared her for the premiere episode ofAnd Just Like That…,in which Miranda has sex with a nun—named Mary, naturally. That sister of the cloth is played by none other thanRosie O’Donnell,a coy in-joke; though she’s one of the most famous lesbians in Hollywood, here she’s playing someone who has never had sex with a woman. “It felt so, I don’t know, electric, and yet still so natural,” Mary tells Miranda in the afterglow. “I never dreamed that my first time could be both those things.” Nixon recently toldVanity Fairthat she personally contacted O’Donnell about the role. “There had been parts that had been written with her in mind before—none of them had ever worked out,” she says. When O’Donnell signed on, it gave Nixon the rare opportunity to have a fellow queer performer play her onscreen love interest. “It was like that whenSarah Paulsonand I got to act opposite each other inRatchet,” she says. “I’ve had a lot of wonderful female, straight co-stars [as] romantic co-stars—but it was a really special treat for me and Rosie.” When Miranda meets Mary, she’s at a romantic low point. Still recently divorced, out as a lesbian, and now broken up with the pickup artistformerly known as Che Diaz,she struggles to find her place in the dating pool. Between sips of a “Phony Negroni,” Miranda and Mary lock eyes from across a lesbian bar—two of the only “randos” left at closing time, as another far younger patron puts it. But there is a spark between them, which is promptly snuffed out by the whole virgin-nun confession. “So, you deflowered the Virgin Mary?” Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) says upon learning about Miranda’s hookup. It feels like this entire storyline was devised byseries bossMichael Patrick Kingsolely to have Carrie deliver that line. Or maybe this one: Miranda asks if she can “ghost a nun.” Carrie gamely replies: “Itwouldbe a Holy Ghost.” The only problem with that plan? Mary, a Canadian visiting New York City for the first time, can’t stop texting Miranda with invitations to ride the carousel in Central Park or venture into the Times Square M&M store. “I don’t know which is worse,” Carrie says, “that you slept with a nun, or a tourist.” Despite all of her punny judgment, Carrie faces her own relationship curveballs in the season three premiere. Most of her friends are highly skeptical about thesure-to-be-futile five-year pauseon her relationship withAidan(John Corbett), who’s trying to be present for his ne’er-do-well teenage son in Norfolk, Virginia, while Carrie decorates the spacious Gramercy Park home she thought they’d live in together. She’s also fielding late-night calls from Aidan, who drunk-dials her with aBridgerton-esque come-on: “I ache for you.” They fumble through two awkward bouts of phone sex, suggesting that their planned relationship break is already off to a rocky start. At least Carrie’s and Miranda’s respective storylines, alongside Seema Patel (Sarita Choudhury) falling asleep with a lit cigarette in bed while waiting for a FaceTime from her Marvel director boyfriend Ravi (Armin Amiri), harken back to the originalSex and the City.We want to seethese women enter into comically fraught, episode-long entanglements that enrich our understanding of each character, then free them up for new romantic adventures. By the episode’s end, Seemapulls a Samantha,telling Ravi some version of “I love you, but I love me more.” Carrie finally begins to interrogate the limits of her unconventional arrangement with Aidan. And Miranda gets reflective about all the changes—some better received than others—she’s undergone in the last few years. Trudging into Times Square, Miranda meets up with Mary to gently break things off. Mary, fresh off seeing the Broadway showWicked, is flying high. But Miranda urges her to embark on her next phase with caution. “So, I gather you’re at the beginning of a new journey, and I know how that is because I just got off a crazy chapter myself,” Miranda says. “But don’t do anything solely based off what you’re feeling right now. Don’t leave God for me.” Miranda never utters the wordsChe Diazout loud, but the implication is undeniable: Don’t blow your life up for the person who guides you through your sexual awakening. That’s exactly what Miranda did after that now infamous finger-bang with Che in Carrie’s kitchen—divorcing Steve, briefly moving to Los Angeles, and sleeping with a comedian who spends bedtime doing Cameo requests. Mary assures Miranda that she’ll never lose her religion, then breaks into an a capella rendition ofWicked’sclosing number, “For Good,”—a ludicrous moment that, given this show’s track record, barely even shocked me. I don’t know if the bonkers storylines ofAnd Just Like That…will change anyone for the better. But they’ve certainly changed me for good.

    "article_text": "Former acting ICE director Jonathan Fahey discusses the Trump administration hitting cartels with new sanctions on 'Fox News Live.' Two family members were charged with conspiring to support aMexican carteldesignated as a terrorist organization. Maxwell Sterling Jensen, 25, and James Lael Jensen, 68, both from Sandy, Utah,were chargedwith conspiring to materially support a Mexican cartel designated as a terrorist organization and conspiracy to commit money laundering, as well as related smuggling charges. According to the Department of Justice (DOJ), the pair allegedly provided material support to the Jalisco New Generation cartel. The men allegedly conspired to conceal and disguise the source of proceeds from illegally smuggled crude oil, in addition to aiding and abetting the fraudulent entry of 2,881 shipments of oil. The DOJ said they allegedly operated an enterprise in Rio Hondo, Texas, named Arroyo Terminals. When the men were arrested, authorities seized four tank barges that contained crude oil, as well as three commercial tanker trucks, one personal vehicle and an Arroyo Terminal pickup.

    "title": "Trump tariff plan faces uncertain future as court battles intensify",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy has the latest on the legal status of President Donald Trump’s tariff policies and more on ‘Special Report.’ A federal appeals court paused a lower ruling blocking PresidentDonald Trump’ssweeping tariffs, siding with the administration Thursday in a legal fight over the White House's use of an emergency law to enact punishing import taxes. The back-and-forth injected more volatility into markets this week after several weeks of relative calm, and court observers and economists told Fox News Digital they do not expect the dust to settle any time soon. Here's what to know as this litigation continues to play out. TRUMP DENOUNCES COURT’S 'POLITICAL' TARIFF DECISION, CALLS ON SUPREME COURT TO ACT QUICKLY President Donald Trump holds a chart as he delivers remarks on reciprocal tariffs during an event in the Rose Garden in Washington, D.C., April 2, 2025.(AFP via Getty Images) The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuittemporarily stayed a lower court rulingThursday that blocked two of Trump's sweeping tariffs from taking force. The ruling paused a decision by the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) allowing Trump to continue to enact the 10% baseline tariff and the so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" that he announced April 2 under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. It came one day after the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled unanimously to block the tariffs. Members of the three-judge panel who were appointed by Trump, former President Barack Obama and former President Ronald Reagan, ruled unanimously that Trump had overstepped his authority under IEEPA. They noted that, as commander in chief, Trump does not have \"unbounded authority\" to impose tariffs under the emergency law. Now, lawyers for the Trump administration and the plaintiffs are tasked with complying with a fast schedule with deadlines in both courts. Plaintiffs have until 5 p.m. Monday to file their response to the Court of International Trade, according to Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel and director of litigation of the Liberty Justice Center, which represents five small businesses that sued the administration. A Fox News graphic shows how countries have responded to President Donald Trump's tariffs.(Fox News; Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images) The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit gave plaintiffs until Thursday to file a response to the stay and the Trump administration until June 9 to file a reply, Schwab told Fox News Digital in an interview. The goal is to move expeditiously, and lawyers for the plaintiffs told Fox News they plan to file briefs to both courts before the deadlines to mitigate harm to their clients. \"Hopefully,\" Schwab said, the quick action will allow the courts to issue rulings \"more quickly than they otherwise would.\" The Trump administration praised the stay as a victory. The appellate court stay on the CIT ruling \"is a positive development for America’s industries and workers,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. \"The Trump administration remains committed to addressing our country’s national emergencies of drug trafficking and historic trade deficits with every legal authority conferred to the president in the Constitution and by Congress.\" But some economists warned that continuing to pursue thesteep tariffscould backfire. FEDERAL JUDGE BLOCKS 5 TRUMP TARIFF EXECUTIVE ORDERS Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange March 28, 2025, in New York City.(Spencer Platt/Getty Images) The bottom line for the Trump administration \"is that they need to get back to a place [where] they are using these huge reciprocal tariffs and all of that as a negotiating tactic,\" William Cline, an economist andsenior fellow emeritus at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said in an interview. Cline noted that this had been the framework laid out earlier by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who had embraced the tariffs as more of an opening salvo for future trade talks, including between the U.S.and China. \"I think the thing to keep in mind there is that Trump and Vance have this view that tariffs are beautiful because they will restore America's Rust Belt jobs and that they'll collect money while they're doing it, which will contribute to fiscal growth,\" said Cline, the former deputy managing director and chief economist of the Institute of International Finance. \"Those are both fantasies.\" 'AMERICAN HERO' OR 'FAILURE': ELON MUSK'S DOGE DEPARTURE DIVIDES CAPITOL HILL Plaintiffs and the Trump administration wait. But whether that wait is a good or bad thing depends on who is asked. Economists noted that the longer the court process takes, the more uncertainty is injected into markets. This could slow economic growth and hurt consumers. For the U.S. small business owners that have sued Trump over the tariffs, it could risk potentially irreparable harm. \"Some of the harm has already taken place. And the longer it goes on, the worse it is,\" said Schwab. A woman under a purple umbrella walks past the Supreme Court Feb. 28, 2024, in Washington.(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) The White House said it will take its tariff fight to the Supreme Court if necessary. But it's unclear if the high court would choose to take up the case. The challenge comes at a time when Trump's relationship with the judiciary has come under increasing strain, which could make the high court wary to take on such a politically charged case. Lawyers for the plaintiffs described the case as \"very likely\" to be appealed to the Supreme Court, but it's unclear whether it will move to review it. \"It's possible that because the case is before the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, which essentially applies to the country, unlike specific appellate courts, which have certain districts, that theSupreme Courtmight be OK with whatever the Federal Circuit decides and then not take the case,\" Schwab said. For now, the burden of proof shifts to the government, which must convince the court it will suffer \"irreparable harm\" if the injunction remains in place, a high legal standard the Trump administration must meet. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Beyond that, Schwab said, the court will weigh a balancing test. If both sides claim irreparable harm, the justices will ask, \"Who is irreparably harmed more? \"And I think it's fair to say that our clients are going to be more irreparably harmed than the United States federal government. Because our clients might not exist, and the United States federal government is certainly going to exist.\" Breanne Deppisch is a national politics reporter for Fox News Digital covering the Trump administration, with a focus on the Justice Department, FBI, and other national news.",

    "article_text": "NHL commissioner Gary Bettman discusses the upcoming playoffs and the future success of professional hockey on ‘Special Report.’ TheEdmonton Oilersadvanced to their second straight Stanley Cup Final as they defeated the Dallas Stars 6-3 in Game 5 of the Western Conference Final at American Airlines Center in Dallas on Thursday night. The Oilers will look for revenge against theFlorida Panthersafter last season's heartbreaking Game 7 loss in the Stanley Cup Final. It took Edmonton one less game in this year's Western Conference Final rematch to dispatch Dallas. Last season, the Oilers beat the Stars 4-2 in the Western Conference Final before moving on. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Edmonton Oilers center Connor McDavid poses with the Western Conference championship trophy at American Airlines Center in Dallas on Thursday.(AP Photo/Julio Cortez) The Oilers raced out to an early lead on Thursday, as they scored on their first two shots. Corey Perry and Mattias Janmark beatStars goalieJake Oettinger to give Edmonton a quick 2-0 lead. Dallas head coach Peter DeBoer didn’t waste any time and pulled Oettinger from the game after he allowed the two goals. However, the switch to backup goalie Casey DeSmith didn't yield much better results. Edmonton's Jeff Skinner beat DeSmith for a goal right after he replaced Oettinger and gave the Oilers a 3-0 lead with his first goal of the playoffs. The Stars managed to cut the lead to 3-2, but Connor McDavid scored a beautiful breakaway goal to make the game 4-2 and shift the momentum back towards the Oilers.

Edmonton's Kasperi Kapanen put the finishing touch on the win with an empty-net goal as time was winding down to make it 6-3. This is the third consecutive season the Stars have lost in the Western Conference Final. \"You’ve got to keep knocking on the door,\" DeBoer said. \"We chased every single game in this series, and that’s a tough way to play hockey against that team. It was the story of the entire series, but the fourth goal, Connor’s goal ... the puck bounces into the neutral zone, he’s coming off the bench, he’s not missing that. It’s game over.\" At the Oilers' celebration after the game, McDavid made sure to touch the Clarence S. Campbell Bowl, the trophy awarded to the Western Conference champion; last year, he superstitiously opted not to touch it, but they went on to lose in the Stanley Cup Final.

Touch it this year, hopefully we win.\" In last season'sStanley Cup Final, the Oilers nearly pulled off one of the most improbable comebacks in sports history.

    "title": "Navy halts dog and cat experiments; PETA writes Hegseth about US taxpayer-funded animal tests",
    "article_text": "PETA senior vice president Daphna Nachminovitch details the federal investigation into the 'cruel' mistreatment of animals by government agencies. The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) penned a letter to Defense SecretaryPete Hegsethand Navy Secretary John Phelan Thursday, thanking the Trump administration for its ban on Navy-funded dog and cat experiments announced this week and requesting a broader ban on all animal testing in all military branches. Phelan on Tuesday terminated all Department of theNavy testing on cats and dogs, saving taxpayer dollars and ending these inhumane studies. The effort was led by White Coat Waste, a 501(c)(3) bipartisan nonprofit organization and government watchdog. \"This is long overdue,\" Phelan said in a video posted to X. \"In addition to this termination, I'm directing the surgeon general of the Navy to conduct a comprehensive review of all medical research programs to ensure they align with ethical guidelines, scientific necessity, and our core values of integrity and readiness.\" PETA on Thursday further urged the Department of Defense to conduct a similar comprehensive, agency-wide audit aimed at rooting out waste, fraud and abuse in cruel andoutdated animal experimentation. NIH CLOSES EXPERIMENTATION LABS ACCUSED OF BRUTALLY KILLING THOUSANDS OF BEAGLES FOR 40+ YEARS Specifically, the international organization requested theDepartment of Defense(DOD) ban the use of animals in Navy decompression sickness and oxygen toxicity tests and prohibit the use of dogs, cats, nonhuman primates, marine animals and other animals currently permitted in Army weapon-wounding tests. The weapon-wounding tests, which were banned during the Reagan administration, were reintroduced in 2020 when theU.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command(USAMRDC) issued a policy allowing for the purchase of \"dogs, cats, nonhuman primates, or marine mammals to inflict wounds upon using a weapon for the purpose of conducting medical research, development, testing, or evaluation.\" The Army in 2023, with encouragement from PETA, cut $750,000 in taxpayer funding for a brain-damaging weapon-wounding experiment on ferrets at Wayne State University in Michigan. In 1983, PETA got a U.S. Department of Defense underground \"wound lab\" shut down and achieved a permanent ban on shooting dogs and cats in military wound laboratories.(PETA) While reviewing other branches, PETA obtained public records showing decompression sickness experiments at the Naval Medical Research Command sliced open baby pigs, implanted devices and locked them in high-pressure chambers for up to eight days before killing them. Researchers are also accused of administering a drug to a pig and inducing a severe escalation in body temperature and muscle contractions before killing the animal. Officials said potentially faulty sedatives may have prolonged the pig’s suffering. PETA, ANIMAL RIGHTS GROUPS PRAISE TRUMP ADMIN FOR PHASING OUT 'CRUEL TESTS ON DOGS' AND OTHER ANIMALS In another incident, a rat suffocated to death after an equipment malfunction, and the researcher failed to report the incident for 23 days, according to PETA. The organization alleged the Navy has wasted more than $5.1 million in federal funding since 2020 for decompression sickness and oxygen toxicity tests on thousands of animals at Duke University, the University of Maryland in Baltimore, the University of California in San Diego and the University of South Florida. In its letters to the Pentagon, PETA specifically calls for officials to conduct a comprehensive audit agency-wide aimed at rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse in cruel and outdated animal experimentation. \"Pigs, rats and other animals feel pain and fear just as dogs and cats do, and their torment in gruesome military experiments must end,\" PETA Vice President Shalin Gala wrote in a statement. \"PETA appreciates the Trump administration’s decision to stop the Navy’s torture tests on dogs and cats, and we urge a broader ban across the Pentagon to end the use of animals in Navy-funded decompression sickness and oxygen toxicity tests, Army-funded weapon-wounding tests and DOD-funded foreign experiments.\" The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) is seeking a wider military ban on animal testing.(iStock) TRUMP ADMIN CUTS ADDITIONAL $1M IN FEDERAL FUNDING FOR 'TRANSGENDER ANIMAL' EXPERIMENTS PETA also requested in the letter that Defense Department officials prohibit funding of tests on animals at foreign institutions. In one experiment in Canada, which is receiving $429,347 in DOD funding, a University of Alberta experimenter is using dogs as \"models\" of a muscle wasting disease. In another ongoing DOD-funded foreign experiment in Australia, which is receiving $599,984, a James Cook University researcher is burning 30% of rats’ body surface with scalding water and into their livers, inflicting an \"[u]ncontrolled hemorrhage.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Department of Defense, Secretary of the Navy's office and Navy Office of Information did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's requests for comment.

    "title": "Activist athletes urge California girls' track title contenders to stand up to trans inclusion at state meet",
    "article_text": "Alliance Defending Freedom attorney Ryan Bangert explains the impact and legal protection of potential protests by student athletes at the upcoming California track and field state championship. California high school girls' track and field athletes will compete in the meet of their lives this weekendunder the national spotlightat the state championship in Clovis. The meet will double asa battlegroundfor the ongoing culture war over trans athletes in girls' sports, with a trans athlete set to compete in multiple girls' events. Protests and demonstrations are expected by spectators. Whether the athletes protest is yet to be seen. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Several prominent former women's athletes who have been impacted by trans inclusion in their careers have expressed support for the girls competing to \"stand up\" against the California Interscholastic Federation during the event: Paula Scanlan, former University of Pennsylvania swimmer, testifies during the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitution and Limited Government hearing on gender-affirming care for children.(Jasper Colt-USA TODAY) Scanlan, aformer UPenn swimmer, was forced to share a team and locker room with Lia Thomas during the 2021-22 women's swimming season. Scanlan became the first UPenn women's swimmer to speak out against the school for allowing Thomas to compete with females, after the controversial season ended. Scanlan skewered California Governor Gavin Newsom for letting the situation in the state get to this point, and encouraged all females athlete to \"stand up.\" \"It’s make or break for California. This is no longer a bipartisan issue, and even democrats see that. Gavin Newsom couldn’t be more out of touch with women. I am beyond grateful that the Trump administration is taking this issue so seriously and I encourage all female athletes to stand up against this. I support them and I know the majority of Americans do too,\" Scanlan told Fox News Digital. Stephanie Turner on Fox News Channel(Fox News) Turner made global headlines at the start of April when she refused to compete and knelt in protest of a trans opponent at a fencing match in Maryland. Turner says she would support the girls competing in Clovis to stand up for themselves as well this weekend. \"I fully support these young women standing up against males in the women’s track and field events. CIF has stolen the precious high school competitive years from these young ladies and compromised their athletic and scholastic trajectories by allowing males in their category,\" Turner told Fox News Digital. Turner praised one young woman who has already spoken out, La Canada High School track and field star Katie McGuinness, who urged the CIF to \"take action\" in amending its policy after finishing second to the trans athlete at a sectional final on May 17. \"Katie McGuinness is right, this is a time-sensitive issue and CIF would do well to abandon all transgender policies immediately and comply with both the President’s Executive Order and Title IX,\" Turner said. \"These women are extraordinarily brave to be speaking out at their age. This is not easy, but women and girls across the United States thank them for their stand!\" Payton McNabb was severely injured after being struck in the head and neck by a spike from a transgender-identifying male on the opposing volleyball team.(Courtesy of IW Features and Payton McNabb) McNabb suffered permanent brain injuries after she was spiked in the head by a trans opponent during a high school match in 2022. She has since become a leading ambassador for standing up against trans athletes in girls' and women's sports, and testified before congress alongside Turner at a recent DOGE hearing earlier this month. McNabb reminded girls competing in Clovis this weekend that they have the right to stand up or even \"walk away\" from the competition. CALIFORNIA TOWN RALLIES BEHIND TRUMP AS IT HOSTS TRACK AND FIELD CHAMPIONSHIP AMID TRANS ATHLETE CONTROVERSY \"To the girls competing in California — I know exactly how it feels to lose to a male athlete. It’s not fair, and it’s not right. You’ve trained for years, and now you’re being pushed aside because officials would rather protect feelings than protect girls. You don’t owe silence to anyone,\" McNabb told Fox News Digital. \"If you want to speak up or walk out — do it. You’re not alone, and you’re not crazy for wanting fairness. Women have fought for decades to have equal opportunities in sports. Letting males take over isn’t progress — it’s going backwards. To California officials — you’re failing these girls. You’re letting biological males dominate their sports and take their spots. This isn’t equality — it’s erasure. And we’re done pretending it’s okay.\" Track and field athlete Selina Soule speaks during an event celebrating the House of Representatives passing The Protection Of Women And Girls In Sports Act outside the U.S. Capitol on Apr. 20, 2023, in Washington, DC.(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Soule, a former high school track and field athlete herself in Connecticut, was one of the first young women to stand up against systems that allow biological males to compete against women in 2018. That year, as a four-time National Qualifier, she was forced out of a regional championship due to two trans athletes taking women’s spots and who lost out on the chance to earn attention from college scouts and potential scholarships because of those snubs. Then she began to speak out in interviews with local news outlets. \"I understand exactly how all the girls competing in this upcoming championship meet feel as I was in the same situation for 4 years during high school,\" Soule told Fox News Digital. Soule wouldn't encourage the California athletes to refuse to compete this weekend, but she would support some sort of demonstration by them. \"It’s easy for people to say that girls should take a stand and refuse to compete against a male athlete but it’s not easy to sit it out when you’ve dedicated long hours training and sacrificed things like parties or sleepovers with friends to qualify for this meet. It’s a devastating and demoralizing choice these girls are facing and my heart breaks for them,\" she said. \"If I could say something to each girl in this competition it would be to compete and give it your best. You may have the chance to beat your personal best or break a school record. If you’re robbed of the chance to get a higher place or just miss the podium, you could refuse to stand on the podium next to a male with unfair advantage during the awards ceremony and take your rightful place afterwards. I and the vast majority of this country have your back.\" Soule later sued the state of Connecticut over its gender eligibility policies, and the suit is ongoing. Some California girls' athletes have already taken steps to stand up against the CIF this track and field postseason. Crean Lutheran High Schooler Reese Hogan  stepped up into the first-place stand on the medal podium for triple jump at a sectional final on May 17 after the first-place winner, trans athlete AB Hernandez of Jurupa Valley High School, stepped off it. Footage of Hogan's stunt went viral and helped ignite awareness of the situation in California. Before that, during the Southern Sectional Prelims on May 10, several athletes wore shirts that read \"Protect Girls Sports\" and wielded picket signs that called out the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) for its policies, and some even spoke at a press conference that included activists opposing trans inclusion. However, Fox News Digital previously reported that CIF officials forced multiple girls wearing the shirts to remove them, and the CIF acknowledged the incidents occurred in a statement. Title IX expert Ryan Bangert senior vice president for strategic initiatives and special counsel to the president at the legal advocacy group Alliance Defending Freedom told Fox News Digital that the girls have every right to peacefully protest during the weekend's competitions how they see fit. And any retaliation by the CIF against those who protest could be violations of the first amendment. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"California needs to be cautious because every sovereign entity and every government entity has an obligation to follow the commands of the first amendment, and California is no different,\" Bangert said, adding that the state is under even more scrutiny if it tramples on the first amendment in defense of the \"failing ideology\" of biological males competing in girls' sports. If CIF officials do try to prevent the girls from competing, Bangert suggested there are legal steps they could take in response. \"I think those girls would be well advised to consider all their legal rights and remedies in that situation,\" Bangert said about potential prevention or retaliation against girls who choose to protest this weekend.

The NYPD confirmed to Fox News Digital that its officers \"were modified\" and \"the matter is under internal review.\" The issue involves two detectives, one of whom reportedly served on Mayor Eric Adams' security detail, theNew York Post reported.

His message allegedly indicated that he was sharing \"a decent sample size\" of classified information to demonstrate the types of things he has access to. On May 7, after Laatsch learned that the thumb drive had been retrieved, he allegedly sent a message to the undercover agent appearing to say that he was seeking something in exchange forproviding the information. The following day, he specified that he was interested in \"citizenship for your country\" because he didn't expect things in America \"to improve in the long term,\" the DOJ said.

    "article_text": "Walter Isaacson, author of ‘Elon Musk,’ joins ‘America’s Newsroom’ to discuss Musk’s departure from the Department of Government Efficiency and what’s next for the billionaire entrepreneur. Tesla and SpaceX CEOElon Muskwrapped up his time as the public face of DOGE in a press conference with President Donald Trump on Monday, leaving behind a total estimated $175 billion in government cost-cutting over the past few months. The $175 billion in savings from slashing government contracts, selling assets, identifying improper payments, and other cost-cutting measures amounts to $1,086.96 per each individual taxpayer, according to the DOGE website. The cuts took place all across the government, highlighted by a completedismantling of USAID,where 83% of the agency’s programs and 5,200 contracts were canceled following the conclusion of a six-week review by DOGE. Trump discussed some of the other more significant cuts in the Friday press conference. FLASHBACK: TOP FIVE WILDEST MOMENTS FROM ELON MUSK'S DOGE TENURE AS IT COMES TO AN END President Donald Trump, right, and Elon Musk, chief executive officer of Tesla Inc., during a news conference in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington on May 30, 2025.(Francis Chung/Politico/Bloomberg via Getty Images) \"$20 million for Arab Sesame Street in the Middle East,\" Trump said. \"Nobody knows what that's all about. Nobody's been able to find it. $8 million for making mice transgenders. So they spent $8 million in making mice transgender. And those are better than many others. I could sit here all day and read things just like that.\" While some outlets, including The New York Times and BBC News, havedisputed DOGE’s $175 billion estimateand argued the true number is smaller, Musk told reporters in the Oval Office on Friday that the savings will continue to build, and he is confident the total cuts will amount to $1 trillion in the coming years. WHAT'S NEXT FOR DOGE AFTER ELON MUSK'S DEPARTURE? 'ONLY JUST BEGUN' Elon Musk looks on as President Donald Trump meets South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.(AP/Evan Vucci) \"The DOGE influence will only grow stronger,\" Musk said. \"I liken it to a sort of person of Buddhism. It's like a way of life so it is permeating throughout the government. And I'm confident that over time, we'll see $1 trillion of savings, and a reduction in $1 trillion of waste, fraud reduction.\" Additionally, Musk said that the DOGE cuts would soon hit the $200 billion threshold for fiscal year 25-26. From the start, DOGE was hit with not only a tsunami of negative press and outraged Democratic lawmakers, but also a series of lawsuits, which bogged it down in protracted legal battles as Musk struggled to reach his original estimates of $1-2 trillion in cuts. A DOGE protester holds a sign in Parkersburg, West Virginia.(Fox News Digital) This, coupled with the reality of most of the major end cuts requiring congressional approval to carry out, relegated DOGE’s impact on cutting around the edges of the big programs and agencies it likely would have liked to eliminate entirely.

    "article_text": "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says the mission of DOGE will continue following Elon Musk's departure. WithElon Muskleaving his role at the White House as head of the Department of Government Efficiency and PresidentDonald Trumpsaying DOGE’s work will continue, the question now in Washington is who will take the reins to become Musk’s successor. Musk, who has led Trump’s waste-cutting task force from Inauguration Day until now, announced his departure in an X post this week, saying: \"As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,\" Musk said theDOGE mission\"will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.\" So, who will take Musk’s place? Right now, no one. A senior White House official previously told Fox News Digital that \"the DOGE employees at their respective agency or department will be reporting to and executing the agenda of the president through the leadership of each agency or department head.\" 'AMERICAN HERO' OR 'FAILURE': ELON MUSK'S DOGE DEPARTURE DIVIDES CAPITOL HILL With Elon Musk leaving his role at the White House as head of the Department of Government Efficiency, and President Donald Trump saying DOGE’s work will continue, the question now is: Who will take the reins to become Musk’s successor? The official said DOGE is now part of the \"DNA\" of the federal government, and that it will keep operating as it already has. Speaking with reporters on Thursday, White House Press SecretaryKaroline Leavittconfirmed that \"the DOGE leaders are each and every member of the president's cabinet and the president himself, who is wholeheartedly committed to cutting waste, fraud and abuse from our government.\" These statements cast doubt on whether any singular individual will succeed Musk as the DOGE chief. However, if Trump finds a DOGE successor necessary and decides to shift gears, who could fill Musk’s shoes? While Musk was never an official federal employee, Amy Gleason, a little-known government employee who also worked in the first Trump administration, has been serving as the official acting chief of the United States DOGE Service (USDS) since February. DOGE STAFFING SHAKEUP AS ELON MUSK HANGS UP HIS HAT, WHITE HOUSE CONFIRMS Amy Gleason has been serving as DOGE administrator.(Amy Gleason LinkedIn/Getty) If the president decides to steer clear of any public-facing DOGE chief, it seems likely that he will keep Gleason on as a more behind-the-scenes DOGE leader at USDS. Gleason, 53, is a career official who was recognized by theObama administrationas a \"champion of change\" for her work with several nonprofits researching and raising awareness about a rare autoimmune disorder known as Juvenile Myositis. Gleason previously worked in the first Trump administration in what was then called the U.S. Digital Service before leaving to work at Russell Street Ventures, which was founded by Brad Smith, another DOGE leader. Keeping Gleason on as DOGE chief would allow the president to keep the agency’s efforts alive while following the structure of each cabinet head leading their own waste-cutting programs. As director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought has already been a central figure in DOGE’s waste-cutting efforts. STATE DEPT SAYS DOGE'S CHANGES WILL BE PERMANENT AMID MUSK'S DEPARTURE Then President Donald Trump's nominee for Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought is sworn in during the Senate Banking Committee nomination hearing in the Dirksen Senate Building on January 22, 2025, in Washington, D.C.(Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images) The Wall Street Journal reported that Vought already has plans to continue Musk’s efforts, even in his current role as OMB head. Vought is a close ally of Trump and a much more subdued personality than Musk, making him appear as a likely pick to take over DOGE. However, Vought does come with his own political baggage, with many on the left labeling him a \"Christian nationalist\" and criticizing his role as a co-author of Project 2025. Still, he was successfully confirmed by the Senate in his current role as OMB director. A one-time GOP presidential candidate-turned key Trump ally, Vivek Ramaswamy, has been widely reported as a top contender to replace Musk at the helm of DOGE. Ramaswamy co-led DOGE alongside Musk for a short period at the start of Trump’s second term. However, he stepped down from his DOGE leadership role in February to begin his run for Ohio governor.

Speaking with members of the press on Friday afternoon, PresidentDonald Trumpfloated the possibility of issuing a presidential pardon to disgraced rapperSean \"Diddy\" Combs, saying \"it's not a popularity contest\" and \"I would certainly look at the facts\" if asked. In a federal indictment unsealed on Sept. 17,Combs was chargedwith racketeering conspiracy (RICO); sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion; and transportation to engage in prostitution. If found guilty, he faces a minimum of 15 years behind bars or a maximum sentence of life in prison. He has maintained his innocence throughout the ongoing trial in which witnesses have testified to alleged rape, sexual assault, severe physical abuse, forced labor and drug trafficking.

    "article_text": "White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller vowed that President Donald Trump's administration will bring an end to DEI ‘strangulation.’ PresidentDonald Trumpfired the director of the National Portrait Gallery, Kim Sajet, for being a \"strong supporter\" of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Trump announced the termination in a post on Truth Social on Friday afternoon. \"Upon the request and recommendation of many people, I am hereby terminating the employment of Kim Sajet as Director of the National Portrait Gallery,\" the president wrote. \"She is a highly partisan person, and astrong supporter of DEI, which is totally inappropriate for her position. Her replacement will be named shortly. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\" A White House official told Fox News Digital that Sajet had donated $3,982 to Democrats, including presidential campaigns for former President Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton. Sajet also reportedly donated to other Democrats, including former Vice President Kamala Harris.

The caption of the photo reads, \"Impeached twice, on charges of abuse of power and incitement of insurrection after supporters attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, he was acquitted by the Senate in both trials. After losing to Joe Biden in 2020, Trump mounted a historic comeback in the 2024 election. He is the only president aside from Grover Cleveland (1837-1908) to have won a nonconsecutive second term.\" The White House official also said it was ironic that Sajet said, \"We try very much not to editorialise. I don’t want by reading the label to get a sense of what the curator’s opinion is about that person. I want someone reading the label to understand that it’s based on historical fact.\" The National Portrait Gallery did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment on the matter.

Prior to taking the position, Sajet was the president and CEO of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, and held other positions at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Her biography notes that she was born in Nigeria, was raised in Australia and is a citizen of the Netherlands. She came to the U.S. with her family in 1997. DEFUNDING DEI: HERE’S HOW THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS UNDONE BIDEN’S VERY PRIZED PROGRAMS President Donald Trump announced the termination of National Portrait Gallery director Kim Sajet in a post on Truth Social on Friday.(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) While speaking at the Richardson Symposium: Racial Masquerade in American Art and Culture, at the National Portrait Museum on Nov. 4, Sajet told a crowd that she was asked what she spent most of her time on, to which she answered, \"identity politics.\" \"America has never been able to separate a person’s appearance from their potential,\" she said. \"Our history is filled, and continues to be, with examples of hatred, discrimination, fear, and alienation.\" She then talked about a moment on Dec. 7, 1972, when she \"suddenly felt\" the world was going to come together and do away with \"petty differences\" while thinking holistically about what it meant to be a human. That was the day astronaut Jack Schmidt of Apollo 17 snapped a picture of the earth and coined it the \"Blue Marble.\" \"Well, that utopian vision feels very, very far away today in the terrifying wake of the most uncivil, mistrustful, racially insensitive, sexually exploitative, factually untruthful, digitally manipulated, secretive and inflammatory election of the modern era,\" she said. \"The National Portrait Gallery, as I've mentioned, is all about identity politics, whether it is to defend the label text that says President Eisenhower was cautious on civil rights or explaining why only 25% of women were historically considered cool or standing firm or not, allowing Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, to be removed from the Smithsonian or even outlining why we show the portrait of Sylvia Rivera, the transgender activist in the galleries,\" Sajet later said during the same speech. Hours after taking the Oath of Office onInauguration Dayon Jan. 20, Trump signed an executive order to eliminate allDEI programsfrom the federal government. A day later, the president directed the Office of Personnel Management to notify heads of agencies and departments to close all DEI offices and place those government workers in those offices on paid leave. Earlier this month, Trumpfired Shira Perlmutter, who was in charge of the U.S. Copyright Office, which came just days after terminating the Librarian of Congress, Carla Hayden.

President Donald Trump said that he thinksJoe Bidendidn't really agree with many of his administration's lax border security policies, instead suggesting that those surrounding the former president took advantage of his declining faculties and utilized an autopen feature in the White House to pass radical directives pertaining to the border. The comments came during a press conference from the Oval Office on Friday, during which Trump signaled that investigators are zeroing in on exactly who authorized officials in the White House to sign important documents for Biden using the autopen. \"I think the autopen is going to become one of the great scandals of all time, because you have somebody operating it, or a number of people operating,\"Trump told reporters. \"I knew Joe Biden, Joe Biden wasn't in favor of opening up borders, letting 21 million people into this from prisons and mental institutions and gang members.

Comer said this week he was \"open\" to dragging Biden before the House to answer questions about the matter if need be. \"I understand he signed almost everything with an auto-pen.

    "title": "Two longtime House Democrats face primary challenges from younger opponents",
    "article_text": "Trump's SBA pick Kelly Loeffler goes toe-to-toe with Dem Sen. Ed Markey during her confirmation hearing over whether President Trump's federal funding freeze is \"unlawful.\" Two Democrats who've spent decades in Congress this week became the latest in their party to face primary challenges from much younger opponents. Longtime Democratic MarylandRep. Steny Hoyerhas yet to announce whether he will seek re-election next year for a 24th two-year term in Congress. If he does, he will face a primary challenger who is making Hoyer's age — the congressman turns 86 next month and would be 89 at the end of his next term — a centerpiece of his campaign. Meanwhile, 78-year-old Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts—first elected to Congress nearly half a century ago—announced last October that he would seek another six-year term in the Senate. He is now facing a primary challenger who has criticized what he calls the senator’s \"absence\" in pushing back against PresidentDonald Trump. DEMOCRATS' VICE CHAIR IGNITES CIVIL WAR, TARGETING ‘ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL’ INCUMBENTS IN PRIMARIES Democrat Harry Jarin, seen in a campaign launch video, is primary challenging longtime Democratic Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland in the 2026 elections.(Harry Jarin for Congress) Harry Jarin, 35, a volunteer firefighter and emergency services consultant, said Thursday in a new video announcing his candidacy, \"If you live here in southern Maryland, I want to ask you a tough question. Do you really think that Steny Hoyer, at 89-years-old, is the best person to represent us?\" \"Here's the bottom line: You don't put out a fire by sending in the same people who let it spread. Send in a firefighter,\" Jarin said. \"Maryland deserves a new generation of leadership, and I'm ready to take up the fight.\" And in an interview with Fox News Digital, Jarin said: \"I think we’re facing a really serious constitutional crisis… Congress has really declined as an institution over the last three or four years. Congress has surrendered a lot of its legislative power under the Constitution over to the executive branch. I think that’s been very corrosive to our political system.\" Asked about his motivation to primary challenge Hoyer, Jarin said, \"It’s not just about getting someone younger and fresher in. It’s getting someone in who understands the need to revitalize Congress as an institution.\" Fox News reached out to Hoyer's office for a response, but a spokesperson declined to respond. Hoyer, who first won his seat in Congress in a 1981 special election, from 2003 to 2023, was the second-rankingHouse Democratbehind Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. He served as House Majority Leader from 2007-2011 and from 2019-2023, when the Democrats controlled the chamber. Along with Pelosi, Hoyer stepped down from his longtime leadership position at the end of 2022 but remained in Congress. DEMOCRATS PREDICT HOUSE REPUBLICANS WILL PAY PRICE FOR PASSING TRUMP'S ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’ \"I think all of us have been around for some time and pretty much have a feel for the timing of decisions. And I think all three of us felt that this was the time,\" Hoyer told CNN at the time, as he referred to the moves by the top three House Democrats — Pelosi, Hoyer and Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C. — to step down from their leadership roles. Hoyer has long been a major backer of the Democrats' top issues, and during his second tenure as House majority leader, he played a crucial role in the passage of then-President Joe Biden's so-called American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Longtime Democratic Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, a former House majority leader, will face a primary challenge if he decides to seek re-election in 2026.(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) He represents Maryland's Democrat-dominated 5th Congressional District, which covers a region known asSouthern Maryland,and includes the suburbs south and east of Washington, D.C., a sliver of suburban Baltimore and Annapolis, as well as rural areas farther south. Hoyer, who suffered a minor stroke last year, is the latest high-ranking House Democrat to face a primary challenge from a younger opponent. Pelosi and Reps. Brad Sherman of California and Jan Schakowsky of Illinois have drawn primary challenges, with Schakowsky later announcing that she will no longer run for re-election. Jarin told Fox News that when he spoke with voters in the district about Hoyer, they had concerns about the incumbent's age. \"The main reaction I got when I asked people about Steny Hoyer was first and foremost his age,\" Jarin said. \"The idea that he would be close to 90 years old at the end of the next term is just a little bit nuts for people. I think people are starting to process how extreme a situation that is.\" The primary challenges come as Democrats are still trying to regroup following last November's election setbacks, when the party lost control of the White House and their Senate majority, and came up short in their bid to win back the House. The party's base is angry and energized to push back against the sweeping and controversial moves by Trump in the four months since he returned to theWhite House. Additionally, while much of that anger and energy is directed at fighting the White House and congressional Republicans, some of it is targeted at Democrats whom many in the party's base feel aren't vocal enough in their efforts to stymie Trump. Concurrently, other longtime and older House Democrats in safe blue districts are facing the possibility of primary challenges. Democratic National Committee Vice Chair David Hogg is pledging to support primary challenges against older House Democrats in blue districts.(Dominic Gwinn/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images) This, after newly elected Democratic National Committee Vice ChairDavid Hogglast month pledged to spend millions of dollars through his outside political group to back primary challenges against what he called \"asleep at the wheel\" House Democrats — lawmakers he argued have failed to effectively push back against Trump. The move by the 25-year-old Hogg, a survivor of the horrific shooting seven years ago at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in South Florida, to spend money against fellow Democrats ignited a firestorm within the party. Jarin said that \"we have reached out to David Hogg. We’ve been in communication.\" ButHogg toldThe Washington Post last month that he wouldn't support primary challenges against Hoyer, Pelosi or Clyburn. As for his ability to raise money for his campaign, Jarin said, \"I do come from a political family.\" He noted that his husband was a major donor and bundler for former President Joe Biden's successful 2020 campaign and also served as a DNC finance director, and that his uncle had \"been a big bundler for Democratic causes for a long time.\" \"I think a lot of donors realize that this is a problem but may not be able to say it out loud for fear of repercussions,\" he argued. Jarin said that he's received \"some pushback from donors for concerns of prioritizing more marginal districts\" instead of pouring resources into swing seats as the party aims to win back the House majority in 2026. \"My message to them has been that putting extremely elderly politicians like Steny Hoyer back into office for a 24th term sends a message to voters across the country that Democrats are just the party of status quo and clearly that message has not been working,\" he said. In Massachusetts,first-time candidate Alex Rikleen— a father, former teacher and fantasy sports writer, this week launched a primary challenge against Markey. While Rikleen didn't spotlight the senator's age, he did argue that \"Markey, like many other Democrats, has stood silently by as [Senate Democratic Leader] Chuck Schumer surrenders Democrats' leverage\" in battling Trump. Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, seen at the Democratic National Convention on Aug. 20, 2024, in Chicago, Illinois, is running for re-election in 2026.(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) Rikleen said that he is \"stepping forward to challenge an incumbent because Democrats have shown us that they are not going to change course on their own…in this perilous moment, I believe we need dramatic action now and we are not getting it from our current Democratic leaders.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And while he said that \"Sen. Markeyhas been a fantastic leader on progressive policy throughout my lifetime and he is better than most at standing up for others. In a normal political environment, I'd proudly continue voting for him,\" he argued that \"this is not a normal moment. Better than most is not good enough.\" But Markey has been very visible this year, as he attended protests and rallies across Massachusetts. And last month he traveled to Louisiana to urge the Trump administration to release Rumeysa Ozturk, a student at Massachusetts' Tufts University who was handcuffed while walking on a street by masked Department of Homeland Security agents and detained at an ICE facility. And Markey took to social media on Thursday to once again defend Harvard University in its battle with the Trump administration, pledging that \"Massachusetts will not be bullied.\" Paul Steinhauser is a politics reporter based in the swing state of New Hampshire.

    "title": "Unfinished Business: The budget cuts Musk couldn’t complete and what’s next for DOGE",
    "article_text": "Walter Isaacson, author of ‘Elon Musk,’ joins ‘America’s Newsroom’ to discuss Musk’s departure from the Department of Government Efficiency and what’s next for the billionaire entrepreneur. ThoughElon Muskleaves behind a legacy of massive cuts to government programs which left many members of the Washington, D.C., establishment enraged, he was not able to accomplish all the lofty goals he set at the beginning of his time as head of theDepartment of Government Efficiency. According to a May 26 update onDOGE’s website, the initiative has saved an estimated $175 billion through asset sales, contract cancellations, fraud payment crackdowns and other spending cuts. That translates to about $1,087 in savings per taxpayer. Though significant, the $175 billion is a far cry from the original $2 trillion–nearly a third of the federal government’s total spending–that Musk originally set out to cut. So, what went wrong? Richard Stern, an economics policy expert at the Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital that DOGE \"overestimated what legal flexibility they would have, and the agencies would have, to actually make good on that.\" PRESIDENT TRUMP TEASES ‘LAST DAY, BUT NOT REALLY’ FOR ELON MUSK AT DOGE: OVAL OFFICE PRESSER SET FOR FRIDAY Though Elon Musk leaves behind a legacy of massive cuts to government programs which left many members of the Washington, D.C., enraged, he was not able to accomplish all the lofty goals he set out to at the beginning of his time as head of the Department of Government Efficiency.(AP/Evan Vucci and AP Photo/Etienne Laurent, File) From the start, DOGE was hit with not only a tsunami of negative press and outraged Democratic lawmakers, but also a series of lawsuits, which bogged it down in protracted legal battles. This, coupled with the reality of most of the major end cuts requiring congressional approval to carry out, relegated DOGE’s impact on cutting around the edges of the big programs and agencies it likely would have liked to eliminate entirely. Despite Musk’s efforts, in many cases agencies such as theConsumer Financial Protection Bureaucould only be shrunk and limited, while total elimination requires an act of Congress. Just last week, U.S. District Court Judge Beryl Howell blocked the Trump administration’sdismantling of the U.S. Institute of Peace, writing in a ruling that the removal of its board members and the takeover of its headquarters by members of DOGE are actions that are \"null and void.\" Stern asserted that \"at the end of the day, they were just a little overzealous about how much legal authority they would ultimately have to be able to make this many cuts themselves,\" ELON MUSK 'DISAPPOINTED' BY TRUMP'S SPENDING BILL, SAYS IT UNDERMINES WHAT DOGE IS DOING A federal judge has blocked DOGE efforts to dismantle the US Institute of Peace (USIP), whose building is shown in this March 2025 file photo.(Getty Images) Where Stern believes DOGE can have the greatest impact is on focusing on the information-gathering and whistleblower aspects of its mission. \"You can kind of break down DOGE into two very large buckets,\" he posited. \"The first large bucket, which is the one that's mostly been not done, is actually making grand spending cuts themselves directly. I think the second one was identifying what cuts could be made.\" \"The original plan was that DOGE could come in and do both these things that they could find specific spending to cut … and then the other part of that was identifying this information and making it public that people didn't have that would allow for really thought-out spending cuts to comein from Congress,\" he explained. Though less flashy, Stern believes this is where DOGE, going forward, can have its greatest impact. WHITE HOUSE SENDING $9.4B DOGE CUTS PACKAGE TO CONGRESS NEXT WEEK Elon Musk, chief executive officer of Tesla Inc., arrives for the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland, on Thursday, Feb. 20, 2025. The Conservative Political Action Conference, launched in 1974, brings together conservative organizations, elected leaders, and activists. Photographer: Jason C. Andrew/Bloomberg via Getty Images(Getty) \"There's a lot of think tanks, including Heritage, that have put together lists for a very long time as to policies that we don't think are good, where you could cut spending. But I think what no one has a window into is the really deep mechanics of how a lot of these programs work. And so, because of that, it's actually been very hard in a really robust fashion to even know what programs you could cut spending from or how you would do it or what the ramifications would be,\" he explained. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"So, DOGE, by being in the administration, has been in and continues to be in a position to actually make that public, to actually put a spotlight on that in a way that really almost nobody else was in a position to do,\" Stern went on. \"That can feed rescission bills and congressional cuts down the road. But some admin needed to actually do that. And DOGE is finally doing that.\" Fox News Digital's Greg Norman contributed to this report. Peter Pinedo is a politics writer for Fox News Digital.",

    "title": "'American hero' or 'failure': Elon Musk's DOGE departure divides Capitol Hill",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy and Rep. Pat Fallon, R-Texas, discuss the future of DOGE as Elon Musk steps back from his government role on ‘The Faulkner Focus.’ Emotions are running high on both sides of the aisle on Capitol Hill asElon Muskmakes his way for the exit. Musk is stepping back from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which PresidentDonald Trumpappointed the tech billionaire to run for the first 130 days of his new administration. He's been a polarizing figure in Washington, and that has extended to his announcement earlier this week that he's returning to the private sector. Republicans cheered Musk's work, while Democrats celebrated the end of it. \"Exposing reckless, wasteful government spending isn’t about one individual — it’s about a lasting overhaul of Crazy Town,\"House DOGE CaucusChair Aaron Bean, R-Fla., told Fox News Digital. \"That’s why we’re working closely with the White House to ensure recession packages reflect DOGE’s critical findings.\" SCOOP: HOUSE GOP MEMO HIGHLIGHTS REPUBLICAN WINS IN TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., left, and Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, right, led very different reactions to Elon Musk's departure from the federal government.(Getty Images) And the White House has begun that work already, preparing a $9.4 billion package of spending cuts that's expected to hit Congress on Tuesday. But Bean's comments imply Republicans are going to seek more. It was a sentiment that appeared to be shared by Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., who said that Musk \"did a lot of what he came to do.\" \"A lot of the savingsthat he identifiedare things hopefully that we’ll be able to incorporate into bills that Congress passes. The work that he did was really important. It’s long overdue,\" Thune said. Senate DOGE Caucus Chair Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said she was \"honored\" to work with Musk but signaled he should not be needed for lawmakers to cut government waste. \"It has been wonderful having a willing partner in my decade-long work to make Washington squeal, but I was DOGE before DOGE was cool, and I’m not slowing down,\" Ernst told Fox News Digital in a statement. Other Republicans were more lavish in their praise, like Rep. Mike Haridopolos, R-Fla., who hailed Musk as an \"American hero.\" \"I'm absolutely sad to see him go,\" Haridopolos told Fox News Digital. \"He has given up a lot of time and wealth in order to bring the fiscal house of the United States in order, and he has done a great service to our country by bringing a heck of a lot more transparency of how we'respending money.\" And Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., compared the billionaire to the nation's revered first leaders. Rep. Aaron Bean, R-Fla., helped found the House's DOGE Caucus.(House of Representatives/Getty Images) \"He's kind of half Benjamin Franklin and half Thomas Jefferson. He had the inventiveness of Benjamin Franklin and the vision of a Thomas Jefferson, and I just remember all of our founding fathers were patriots, and they left their regular jobs. They gave up everything to come help found this country. And that's what Elon's [done],\" Marshall told Fox News Digital. On the other side of the aisle, Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., pointed out that as much as Republicans lauded Musk, he also dealt a blow to the House GOP earlier this week by criticizing their \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending bill. \"They brought Musk to DC to fight the deficit, and he left DC calling out how the reconciliation bill will blow the biggest hole in the deficit ever — adding more than $3 trillion in debt,\" Suozzi told Fox News Digital. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., told Fox News Digital he believed DOGE's efforts were misplaced in the end. MIKE JOHNSON, DONALD TRUMP GET ‘BIG, 'BEAUTIFUL’ WIN AS BUDGET PASSES HOUSE \"Initially, I said we should work with Musk to find common ground where there is real waste — like defense contractors, Medicare Advantage overpayments, and prescription drugs. It is sad that DOGE faced opposition in focusing on those issues, and that agencies like USAID and NIH are being dismantled,\" Khanna said. Others on the left unleashed on Musk directly. Democrats have held up the Tesla CEOas a boogeymansince he began campaigning for Trump, using him as a living example of the wealthy, out-of-touch people they believed the Republican White House was benefitting. \"Elon came to Washington thinking he could run the government like one of his companies—firing people left and right, gutting essential services, and tearing this s--- up from the ground up,\" Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, wrote on X, calling for an investigation into Musk's work. Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., pointed out that as much as Republicans lauded Musk, he also dealt a blow to the House GOP earlier this week by criticizing their \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending bill.(AP Photo/Stefan Jeremiah) House Progressive Caucus Chairman Greg Casar, D-Texas, meanwhile, took credit for Musk leaving despite his fixed tenure. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Musk’s exit is an enormous victory for Democrats and working people. This is a sign of how powerful the anti-corruption, anti-billionaire movement in American politics can be,\" Casar said in a statement. \"Musk did not choose to leave because Elon Musk likes to follow the rules. Musk will leave because the American people built enough political pressure that he had no choice.\" And Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J. considered a potential 2028 presidential candidate, wrote on X, \"Musk failed others and served himself.\" \"But there’s an irony in his failure: in his quest to destroy government, he reminded us why it matters. To look out for hungry kids, to keep planes safe, to deliver Social Security checks, and to do the quiet work to serve the common good,\" Booker said. When reached for comment on this story, White House spokesman Harrison Fields told Fox News Digital, \"DOGE is integral to the federal government’s operations, and its mission, as established by the President’s executive order, will continue under the direction of agency and department heads in the Trump administration. DOGE has delivered remarkable results at an unprecedented pace, and its work is far from complete.\" Fox News Digital also reached out to Tesla for comment from Musk. Trump, for his part, heaped praise on Musk at a joint press conference on Friday. \"Elon’sservice to America has been without comparison in modern history. He's already running one of the most innovative car companies in the world, if you look at his factories and compare them with some of the old factories we have, and it's a big difference. And the most successful space company, I guess in history, you would have to say. The largest free speech platform on the internet,\" Trump said. \"Yet, Elon, willingly, with all of the success, he willingly accepted the outrageous abuse and slander and lies and attacks because he does love our country.\" Elizabeth Elkind is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital leading coverage of the House of Representatives.

He served in the Delaware Army National Guard for more than 10 years, completing a tour in Iraq where he earned the Bronze Star for his service, and became the state’s attorney general before his death.

And then the doctor goes, 'Do you have any idea why you would have such a brutal infection on your kneecap?’\" Cyrus’ music video shoot put her in close contact with one of the busiest sidewalks in the country.(iStock) While the singer did not disclose a specific diagnosis, medical experts say her case is a reminder of how everyday public spaces can present hiddenhealth hazards. \"Strep or staph bacteria are common causes of skin infection like cellulitis.\" Dr. Marc Siegel, clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and Fox News senior medical analyst, noted that extremely aggressive bacteria are not common in urban settings. \"Flesh-eating bacteriaon city streets is very rare,\" Siegel, who did not treat Cyrus, told Fox News Digital. \"Rat urine can cause leptospirosis, a bacteria that causes flu-like symptoms.\" After filming a music video on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, Miley Cyrus said she was hospitalized with a knee infection.(iStock) The doctor said he believes the likely cause was a more typical bacterial infection rather than something exotic, althoughcommon bacteriacan cause serious skin reactions. \"Strep or staph bacteria are common causes of skin infection like cellulitis,\" said Siegel. \"Bacteria can be found [on streets], like E. coli, shigella and enterococci, which are from fecal matter, and may get onto the bottoms of shoes,\" he added. HODA KOTB REVEALS DAUGHTER'S CONCERNING DIAGNOSIS INFLUENCED HER EXIT FROM 'TODAY' These infections do not typically originate from the street itself, the doctor said, but can develop when skin comes in contact with bacteria, which can happen during close exposure to surfaces like sidewalks. The risk of infection often increases whenthe skinis broken or irritated, allowing bacteria to enter the body more easily. \"The best way to keep this from happening is to be fastidious with hygiene,\" said an emergency medicine physician.(iStock) Even minor cuts and scrapes can become gateways for infection when exposed to contaminated surfaces, according to Dr. Ken Perry, an emergency medicine physician in Charleston, South Carolina. \"For most patients, these infections are contracted from open wounds in the skin or some other breach in the skin barrier,\" Perry, who also did not treat Cyrus, told Fox News Digital. Such infections are usually easily treated withcommon antibiotics, according to the doctor. While most people do not make close bodily contact with sidewalks and busy streets, even limited exposure can sometimes pose a risk, experts say.(iStock) Cyrus’ shoot put her in close contact with one of the busiest sidewalks in the country, which doctors say can heighten the danger. \"In the case of Miley Cyrus, she states that she contracted this after rolling around on the ground during the filming of her music video,\" said Perry. AMERICAN HONEYMOON HOTSPOT HIT BY HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS ILLNESS, HEALTH OFFICIALS WARN \"The foot traffic could easily contaminate the area with bacteria from animal or even human sources,\" he hypothesized. \"For the majority of the population, rolling around on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is not common behavior, but even casual interaction could put an individual in contact withharmful bacteria,\" Perry added. Doctors agree thatbasic hygieneis one of the best ways to avoid infection, especially in public spaces. \"The best way to keep this from happening is to be fastidious with hygiene,\" said Perry.

    "title": "Smoking marijuana and eating cannabis gummies both linked to dangerous health risk, study finds",
    "article_text": "Pediatric emergency physician Dr. Caleb Ward explains the risks associated with marijuana use on ‘Fox & Friends.’ Long-termcannabis usein any form has been linked to a greater risk of heart disease. In a new study, researchers at UC San Francisco determined that eating edible cannabis, such as gummies, has the same impact oncardiovascular riskas smoking marijuana. The risk stems from reduced blood vessel function, according to the study, which was published in JAMA Cardiology on May 28. HEAVY CANNABIS USE COULD POSE THIS THREAT TO THE BRAIN The study included 55 people between 18 and 50 years of age who were \"outwardly healthy.\" The participants were divided into three groups: those whoregularly smokedmarijuana, those who ate edibles containing THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), and those who didn’t use cannabis, according to a UCSF press release. Long-term cannabis use in any form has been linked to a greater risk of heart disease, according to a new study.(iStock) The cannabis users had been consuming the substance at least three times weekly for at least one year. On average, the smokers had the habit for 10 years, while those consuming edibles had been doing so for five years, the release noted. In September 2024, the participants underwent testing to determine how well their blood vessels functioned and whether the cells lining the blood vessels were affected. DEMENTIA RISK CONNECTED TO CANNABIS-RELATED HOSPITAL VISITS, SAYS STUDY All cannabis users were found to have \"decreased vascular function,\" comparable to those who smoke tobacco. Their blood vessel function was roughly half compared to those who did not use cannabis. This side effect has been linked to a higher risk of heart attack,high blood pressureand other cardiovascular conditions, the researchers noted. Eating edible cannabis, such as gummies, has the same impact on cardiovascular risk as smoking marijuana, researchers say.(iStock) The participants who smoked marijuana were also found to have changes in their blood serum that harmed cells lining their blood vessels and lymphatic vessels, an effect that was not seen in those who ate edible cannabis. The researchers noted that while smoking marijuana and consuming edibles both affect vascular function, they likely do so for different reasons. SHINGLES VACCINE HAS UNEXPECTED EFFECT ON HEART HEALTH \"Chronic cannabis smoking and THC ingestion were associated with endothelial dysfunction [impaired functioning of the endothelial cells lining the inside of blood vessels] similar to that observed in tobacco smokers, although apparently occurring via distinct mechanisms,\" the researchers wrote. \"This study enhances the understanding of the potential risks to vascular health linked to cannabis use and provides more evidence that cannabis use is not benign.\" All cannabis users were found to have \"decreased vascular function,\" comparable to those who smoke tobacco.(iStock) Dr. Bradley Serwer, a Maryland-based cardiologist and chief medical officer at VitalSolution, an Ingenovis Health company that offers cardiovascular and anesthesiology services to hospitals nationwide, said he was not surprised by the study’s findings. \"We have known that the chronic use of THC-containing compounds can have negativehealth consequences— this study just reaffirms those prior studies,\" Serwer, who was not involved in the UCSF research, told Fox News Digital. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The study did have some limitations. \"Variability in cannabis strains complicates standardization,\" the researchers wrote. \"Self-reported cannabis use may introduce recall bias; thus, participants were queried at multiple points: in the online survey, at the eligibility interview and before each visit.\" \"This study enhances the understanding of the potential risks to vascular health linked to cannabis use and provides more evidence that cannabis use is not benign,\" the researchers said.(iStock) It was also challenging to determine whether blood vessel function could have also been affected by lifestyle factorslike stress, caffeine and secondhand smoke exposure, they noted. Serwer pointed out that this was a \"very small\" study of only 55 people, all living in the San Francisco Bay area. \"The decision to use or avoid it should be made with all benefits and risks in mind.\" \"The study did not allow for variability in the different strains of cannabis, and they used a self-reporting survey, which can be under- or over-reported,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"They looked for physiologic endpoints and not hard endpoints, such asheart attacks, strokesor death. We have to infer that the physiologic endpoints would result in cardiovascular events.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER The cardiologist said he agreed, however, with the conclusion that cannabis use is \"not benign.\" \"Chronic use does have potential cardiovascular risks,\" he warned. \"There are therapeutic uses of cannabis, and the decision to use or avoid it should be made with all benefits and risks in mind.\" \"We have known that the chronic use of THC-containing compounds can have negative health consequences — this study just reaffirms those prior studies,\" a cardiologist said.(iStock) In general, Serwer said he cautions all of his patients to avoid any unnecessary cardiac risks. \"As clinicians, we must weigh the benefits and the risks of amedicine/drugor intervention,\" he said. \"If the risks outweigh the benefits, it should be avoided.\" For more Health articles, visitwww.foxnews.com/health The study was funded mainly by the National Institute on Drug Abuse; the California Department of Cannabis Control; the California Tobacco-Related Disease Program; the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; and the FDA Center for Tobacco Products.

I think it's been amazing for women's sports.

And then in the midst of that I tore my right hamstring while I was sprinting, because I was overcompensating. I came back to the league for 11 games and then tore my groin. Isaac credited his faith, family, and support system for helping get past the string of injuries. \"(I) was able to get through it.

    "article_text": "Panelists Payton McNabb and Paula Scanlan discuss the political debate around transgender athletes in women’s sports on ‘The Ingraham Angle.’ A high school softball team in Minnesota is deep in the state playoffs and the political news cycle, both thanks to itsdominant transgender pitcher. Champlin Park High School in Minnesota defeated the defending state champions, Rogers High School, in the sectional final on Thursday by a score of 1-0. Thetrans pitcherthrew 14 shutout innings, bringing the athlete's season ERA down to 0.88. Three anonymous players who claim to have faced the pitcher filed a lawsuit against the state on May 20 for allowing the athlete to compete against female players. The situation has prompted national scrutiny amid the ongoing political divide over biological males in girls' and women's sports. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Champlin Park's school district provided a statement to Fox News Digital defending the decision to allow the athlete to compete on the softball team. \"Throughout the entire season, and as the Rebels advance to the state tournament, it is important to note that all of the student athletes participating for the Champlin Park Softball team are eligible to compete in compliance with Minnesota State High School League rules and applicable state law. Due to data privacy laws, the District is not able to provide public comment regarding a specific student athlete,\" a statement from the Anoka-Hennepin School District stated. \"In addition, the District is named in an active lawsuit which limits what information can be shared.\" The pitcher will now lead Champlin Park into the state tournament next week for the first time in program history. The lawsuit against Minnesota was filed by the religious law firm Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF). The defendants are Attorney General Keith Ellison, the Minnesota State High School League Executive Director Erich Martens, Minnesota Department of Human Rights Commissioner Rebecca Lucero and Minnesota Commissioner of Education Willie Jett. \"Minnesota is failing its female athletes. The state is putting the rights of males ahead of females, telling girls their hard work may never be enough to win and that they don’t deserve fairness and safety,\" Alliance Defending Freedom Legal Counsel Suzanne Beecher told Fox News Digital. \"By sacrificing protection for female athletes, Minnesota fails to offer girls equal treatment and opportunity, violating Title IX’s provisions. Our client, Female Athletes United, is right to stand up for its members by challenging the state’s discriminatory policy and advocate for true equality in sports.\" HOW TRANSGENDERISM IN SPORTS SHIFTED THE 2024 ELECTION AND IGNITED A NATIONAL COUNTERCULTURE Ellison's office has responded to the lawsuit in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"In addition to getting exercise and the fun of competition, playing sports comes with so many benefits for young people. You build friendships that can last a lifetime, you learn how to work as part of a team, and you get to feel like you belong,\" the statement read. \"I believe it is wrong to single out one group of students, who already face higher levels of bullying and harassment, and tell these kids they cannot be on the team because of who they are. I will continue to defend the rights of all students to play sports with their friends and peers.\" Ellison is also suing President Donald Trump and the Department of Justice to ensure transgender athletes can continue participating in girls' sports in the state. After Trump signed the \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports\" executive order, the Minnesota State High School Leagueannounced itwould defy federal law by allowing transgender athletes to continue playing in women's sports. Ellison then claimed at a press conference on April 22 that he received notice from the Department of Justice threatening legal action if the state did not follow the executive order, so the AG decided to sue first. The White House later responded to the lawsuit, condemning Ellison for taking legal action to enable trans inclusion.

This is creepy and anti-woman,\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields told Fox News Digital. Minnesota's state legislature failed to pass the \"Preserving Girls’ Sports Act\" in early March, which would have stated that \"only female students may participate in an elementary or secondary school level athletic team or sport that an educational institution has restricted to women and girls.\" Follow Fox News Digital’ssports coverage on X, and subscribe tothe Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

    "article_text": "'Fox News @ Night' panelists Kerry Wachter and Ryan Walters discuss a school board's fight to keep its Native American mascot. An investigation by theDepartment of Education’sOffice for Civil Rights (OCR) into two New York state agencies has found that both violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act over a ban on Native American-inspired mascots and logos – an issue thrust into the national spotlight because of one Long Island school district. The Department of Education released a press release of its findings on Friday, just a month afterfirst launching the probeinto the New York Department of Education and the New York State Board of Regents. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon testifies before a House Committee on Appropriations subcommittee budget hearing on the US Department of Education on Capitol Hill, Wednesday, May 21, 2025, in Washington.(AP Photo/Rod Lamkey, Jr.) \"The Trump Administration will not stand idly by as state leaders attempt to eliminate the history and culture of Native American tribes,\" U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, who visited Massapequa High School on Friday, said. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM \"Rather than focus on learning outcomes, the New York Department of Education and Board of Regents has set its sights on erasing Massapequa’s history – while turning a blind eye to other districts’ mascots that are derived from or connected to other racial or ethnic groups. We will stand with the people of Massapequa until commonsense is restored and justice is served, and until New York comes into compliance with federal law.\" The investigation was brought about when the Native American Guardians Association (NAGA) filed a complaint in April after claiming that the state agencies forced Massapequa School District, home ofthe Chiefs,to retire its mascot.

We call on federal and state leaders to help us defend these dwindling expressions or our presence and contributions,\" Vice President of NAGA Frank Blackcloud said in a statement at the time. TRUMP RIPS 'RIDICULOUS' CALLS FOR NEW YORK HIGH SCHOOL TO CHANGE NATIVE AMERICAN MASCOT \"Maintaining a respectable presence in NY State schools is vital to educational equity, historical truth, and the civil rights of all American Indians.\" The Department of Education  also found that while Native American-inspired mascots, names and logos were not permitted under the policy, others that \"appear to have been derived from other racial or ethnic groups\" were, making the policy \"discriminatory.\" The district sued the state in September, claiming its First Amendment rights were violated, but a federal judge ruled against it.

    "title": "California town rallies behind Trump as it hosts track and field championship amid trans athlete controversy",
    "article_text": "Clovis, California, Mayor Pro Tem Diane Pearce spoke to Fox News Digital about her city hosting the state track and field championships, which drew scrutiny from Trump’s administration over a transgender athlete competing in the girls' category. Clovis, California, will be the epicenterin the political battle over trans athletes in girls' sports this weekend. The town is set to host the state track and field championships, which has been thrust into the national spotlight amid a trans athlete competing in the girls' category after PresidentDonald Trumpcalled out the situation on Truth Social this week. Dianne Pearce, the town's mayor pro tem, told Fox News Digital she has been actively lobbying to make Trump aware of the situation for weeks and got her fellow local officials involved. \"I've been in touch with the White House legislative affairs office to kind of see what would be needed from this community, from the Clovis area to show our support for the Trump administration's efforts to get California to comply with Title IX and his [\"Keeping Men out of Women's Sports\"] executive order,\" Pearce said. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Pearce said her path to getting the White House involved was to \"amplify the voices\" of the town's residents, who only support female athletes competing in girls' sports. Pearce succeeded in that goal, which culminated in a press conference involving state and local leaders speaking out in support of Trump's executive order and against Democrats for enabling trans athletes to play inCalifornia girls' sportsahead of the championship meet. Pearce says Trump's post was a driving factor in driving enthusiasm for the cause. The press conference featured statements from Pearce, Clovis Unified School District board trustee Tiffany Stoker Madsen, state Assemblyman David Tangipa, who represents the district where Clovis is based, U.S. House Rep. Vince Fong, who also represents the district where Clovis is based, and Fresno County supervisors Gary Bredefeld and Nathan Maxson, all speaking in support of Trump's agenda on the issue. \"We must stand for what is true and what is fair, especially in areas where biological differences make a difference,\" said Stoker Madsen. \"What is happening in women's sports is wrong. These female athletes deserve a level playing field… I urge Governor Newsom and our California state legislatures to protect the women of California.\" Other residents and local officials, including Mayor Vong Mouanoutoua, stood behind the speakers in solidarity with the pro-Trump stance. While Mouanoutoua and Pearce are both Republicans, Clovis as a town has leaned left in recent years, albeit less left than other parts of the deep-blue state. The town's county of Fresno voted in favor of Trump in the 2024 election by a margin of 50.9% to 46.5%. However, the county voted Democrat in every prior presidential election dating back to 2008. Now, the issue of trans athletes appears to be potentially pushing the town, or at least its leadership, even further into Trump's corner. And residents will get an up-close look at the impact of the issue at this weekend's title meet. The state title meet will take place at Buchanan High School's Veterans Memorial Stadium, with the preliminary round on Friday and the finals on Saturday. The event is expected to feature protesters and security. California high school girls' athletes wear \"Protect Girls Sports\" shirts at a postseason track meet at Yorba Linda High School on Saturday, May 10, 2025.(Courtesy of Reese Hogan) In Trump's Tuesday Truth Social post, he claimed he would be \"ordering local authorities, if necessary, to not allow the transitioned person to compete in the State Finals.\" Pearce said she has no knowledge of this being communicated to the town's police force. \"As far as I know that has not occurred,\" she said. AClovis Unified Police Departmentspokesperson told Fox News Digital that they are also unaware of any communication with Trump involving security procedures for the event. Still, Pearce is expecting a vigilante police presence at the event. \"They are prepared to make sure that this weekend's state championships are a safe environment for our athletes and their families and those who choose to come out and support them this weekend,\" Pearce said. Once the competition begins, all eyes will be on the trans athlete, AB Hernandez of Jurupa Valley High School. Hernandez has dominated in girls' long jump and triple jump this postseason, taking first place in both events at the Southern Sectional finals on May 17 and the state qualifiers on May 24. TEEN GIRLS OPEN UP ON TRANS-ATHLETE SCANDAL THAT TURNED THEIR HIGH SCHOOL INTO CULTURE WAR BATTLEGROUND Hernandez has garnered scrutiny during the athlete's dominant postseason run, often getting heckled by spectators at the meets. Pearce hopes that spectators treat Hernandez with respect during the events on Friday and Saturday. \"I expect people to treat this athlete with compassion. I think, unfortunately, the failures of the adults who set this policy created this situation. They have allowed this particular athlete to be in a position where controversy surrounds him wherever he goes, and I think that's unfortunate,\" Pearce said. \"I don't think anybody should do anything to make him unsafe while he's here in Clovis competing, but again, it's unfair for him to be in the girls' division.\" Pearce said her \"worst-case scenario\" for this weekend's meet would be a lack of respect and security for any of the competitors involved. \"If there is anything that isn't respectful and challenges the safety and security of the environment and the atmosphere, that would be terrible,\" Pearce said. \"These kids deserve better than that. They've been failed by the adults already at the legislative level and the policy level by the CIF, I hope those attendants don't fail them as well.\" What Pearce does hope to see is the female athletes emerge victorious in their respective events. However, she is also prepared for more potential fallout from the meet after helping to summon Trump's attention to the situation. Trump's insistence on enforcing his executive order has already resulted in a months-long feud between his administration and the Democrat-controlled state of Maine. The feud has resulted in multiple funding freezes, which have already been reversed, and a lawsuit against the state by the U.S.Department of Justice. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP With the Justice Department launching an investigation against California this week after Trump's post, Pearce knows that her state could very well be next in line for funding cuts on the issue. Additionally, as a public employee, she knows that it could affect her and her colleagues, but Pearce would fully support any funding cuts to her state over the issue anyway. To her, it is not a hard decision to support. \"It's not a hard decision to come to, because more important to me is that our girls and that their spaces are respected and protected,\" Pearce said. \"If they have to threaten that type action against CIF, Governor Newsom and state legislature that they would pull federal funding from the state, again, the decision rests with those leaders. They can do the right thing and we don't even have to talk about this.\" Follow Fox News Digital’ssports coverage on X, and subscribe tothe Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

Tobin said he credits his wife for keeping him on track during his preparation for the challenging hike.(Mike Tobin) \"I was just trying to think, 'Keep your head about yourself.

    "article_text": "Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy shares why he is so adamant about pet adoption in honor of National Rescue Dog Day May 20 on 'My View with Lara Trump.' Once terrified of dogs, German adventurer Heike Pirngruber is nowwalking the globewith Butch, a flea-covered puppy she rescued in Mexico that's reportedly become one of the most well-traveled dogs on the planet. Together, the two have crossed continents by foot, canoe, motorbike and tuk tuk, news agency SWNS reported. Pirngruber, 53, adopted theAustralian cattle puppyin 2021 while she was staying in a beach hut in Baja California, Mexico. WORLD-TRAVELING COUPLE VISITS 197 COUNTRIES, REVEALS TOP DESTINATIONS Butch was just a month old, malnourished and alone when she found him. \"I never really liked dogs when I was a kid,\" Pirngruber of Heidelberg, Germany, told SWNS. \"But the first moment I had little Butch in my arms and knew he was mine now, I couldn’t believe how I felt.\" Heike Pirngruber adopted Butch in 2021 while she was staying in a beach hut in Baja California, Mexico. Her life changed from that moment, she said.(Heike Pirngruber / SWNS) Her fear of dogs came from years of solo travel — seven of them spent cycling around the world. She was often chased by aggressive strays, she said. But her perspective began to change after a chance encounter at the beach hut. She hadcooked grilled chickenwhen a street dog, later named Max, appeared at her door, SWNS reported. Initially hesitant, she was convinced by a friend to feed him. The next day, Max returned with two companions, Brownie and Pushy. \"I never really liked dogs when I was a kid,\" said Pirngruber. \"But the first moment I had little Butch in my arms … I couldn’t believe how I felt.\"(Heike Pirngruber / SWNS) She began feeding them regularly and slowly shed her fear. Later, when a local tried to give away a litter of flea-ridden puppies, Pirngruber made a life-changing decision. She chose Butch and took him on the road.

I have such a connection with him.\" But afteradopting Butch, she scrapped that plan and chose other ways to continue their journey.

    "article_text": "International researchers from the Noah's Ark Project have tested soil samples from the Durupinar site in eastern Turkey, which suggest that the boat-shaped site once harbored ancient wood. (Credit: NoahsArkScans.com) A 1,600-year-oldByzantine-eramosaic from a Christian monastery was recently put on public display for the first time, giving a glimpse into life during ancient times. The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs made a statement about the unveiling of the Be’er Shema mosaic earlier this week. The mosaic was officially opened to the public at the Merhavim Regional Council complex in the Southern District of Israel on Sunday. The ministry described the art piece as \"one of the most impressive mosaics discovered in the south of the country.\" ANCIENT JEWISH RITUAL BATH, OLDEST OF ITS KIND IN EUROPE, UNCOVERED BY ARCHAEOLOGISTS \"The approximately 1,600-year-old colorful mosaic presents 55 medallions decorated withhunting scenes, animals and scenes of everyday life,\" the statement also noted.

    "title": "5 AI prompts to put serious money in your pocket",
    "article_text": "A majority of small businesses are using artificial intelligence and finding out it can save time and money. So, you want to start making money using AI but you’re not trying to build Skynet or learn 15 coding languages first? Good, because neither am I. You don’t need to become the next Sam Altman or have a Ph.D. in machine learning to turnartificial intelligenceinto real income. What youdoneed is curiosity, a dash of creativity, and the right prompts. 💸 Enter to win $500 for youand$500 for your favorite person or charity in ourPay It Forward Sweepstakes. Hurry, ends soon! I’ve pulled together five powerful, practical prompts you can throw into ChatGPT (or your AI tool of choice) to help you start earning extra cash this week. These aren’t pie-in-the-sky dreams or $10K-a-month YouTube ad schemes. They’re doable, even if your calendar is already packed. 5-MINUTE CLEANUP FOR YOUR PHONE AND COMPUTER Let’s get to it. 1. Fast-Track Your Freelance Life Prompt to use:\"Act as a freelance business coach. Suggest 3 services I can offer on Fiverr or Upwork using AI tools like ChatGPT, Midjourney or Canva. I have [insert skill: writing/design/admin/accounting/managerial] experience.\" Why this works:Freelance work is exploding right now. Platforms like Upwork and Fiverr are filled withsmall businessesand entrepreneurs who need help—but don’t have the budget to hire full-time staff. If you’ve got any kind of professional background, you can use AI tools to turbocharge your services. Writing blog posts? ChatGPT can give you a draft. Creating logos or social media templates? Midjourney and Canva are your new best friends. You don’t need a team. You don’t need fancy software. You just need a good prompt and the confidence to say, \"Yes, I can do that.\" AI helps you scale what you already know how to do. A man is pictured with a smartphone and laptop computer on January 31, 2019.(Neil Godwin/Future via Getty Images) 2. Make Product Descriptions Sexy Again Prompt to use:\"Rewrite this Etsy or Shopify product description to make it more compelling and SEO-friendly. Target audience: [insert group]. Here’s the original: [paste description].\" Why this works:Let’s face it—most product descriptions online are a snooze. But good copy sells. Whether you’re running your own shop or helping someone else with theirs, compelling product descriptions convert clicks into customers. Use ChatGPT to punch up the language, fine-tune for SEO, and speak directly to your ideal buyer. DON’T SCAM YOURSELF WITH THE TRICKS HACKERS DON’T WANT ME TO SHARE Remember: people don’t just want to buy a weird mug. They want to buy what itsays about them. That’s where a smart rewrite can turn browsers into buyers. 3. Social Posts That Sell Prompt to use:\"Create 5 attention-grabbing Instagram captions to promote this [product/service]. Keep the tone [fun, confident, expert] and include a strong call to action.\" Why this works:We live in a scroll-happy world. Your social captions need to grab attention in less than three seconds. But not everyone’s a copywriter—and not everyone has time to be. AI can help you crank out engaging content in the tone and style that fits your brand. Add a great photo, post consistently, and you’re suddenly a one-person content agency without the overhead (or endless Zoom meetings). A photo taken on October 4, 2023 in Manta, near Turin, shows a smartphone and a laptop displaying the logos of the artificial intelligence OpenAI research company and ChatGPT chatbot.(MARCO BERTORELLO/AFP via Getty Images) If you’re managing social for clients or your own biz, this prompt is gold. Use it to build content calendars, writereels scripts, or even draft ad copy. 4. Polite Emails That Save You Money Prompt to use:\"Write a short, polite email to ask for a lower rate or discount on [tool/service/platform]. Mention that I’m a loyal customer comparing alternatives.\" Why this works:Negotiating discounts doesn’t always feel comfortable but it absolutely works. Companies often have unpublished deals, especially for longtime users or small businesses. And customer service reps? They're human beings. A kind,well-written emailmight be all it takes to get a discount on that software you’re using every month. 20 TECH TRICKS TO MAKE LIFE BETTER, SAFER OR EASIER I’ve personally saved hundreds of dollars just by sending quick, respectful emails like this. AI can help you strike the perfect tone confident but kind, assertive but not pushy. 5. Your Passive Income Kit Prompt to use:\"Give me 3 high-demand, low-competition ideas for a short e-book or low-content book I can sell on Amazon. I have experience in [insert topic].\" Why this works:You have knowledge people want. Package it. Sell it. Repeat. Whether it’s a short guide on starting a backyard garden or a workbook for productivity hacks, e-books and low-content books (like journals or planners) sell surprisingly well. And AI can help you brainstorm ideas, outline chapters, even draft content to polish up. In this photo illustration the logo of Apple Mail Programme Mail can be seen on a smartphone next to a finger on March 27, 2024 in Berlin, Germany.(Photo Illustration by Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images) Upload itto AmazonKDP or Gumroad, and now you’ve got a digital product that can earn money in your sleep. People pay for convenience, and you have life experience worth sharing. Final Thought You don’t need to master AI to start earning with it. You just need to startusingit. These five prompts are a low-risk, high-potential way to get your feet wet. And if you need a hand turning these sparks into something bigger, I’m here. I built my multimillion-dollar business with no investors and no debt. I’ve done this without a big team or expensive consultants. And I’d love to help you do the same. Drop me a note.

    "title": "Harvard vs. Trump: All the president wants is for the university to obey the law",
    "article_text": "Fox News' Chanley Painter provides details on a judges decision to block President Donald Trump's effort to ban foreign students' enrollments and the comments from Harvard President Alan Garber. \"It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future,\" America’s philosopher laureate Yogi Berra once said. Wise counsel, but it’s difficult to see how Harvard wins its war of wills withPresident Donald Trump. The oldest and most hallowed university in the country decided to fight Trump after he made a series of demands in April, most of which were reasonable. The reasons why they are fighting aren’t crystal clear, but they are discernable. One could be sheer hubris. Harvard is Harvard; it thinks Trump a rube and cannot give in to him. In that case, its fate is sealed. Hubris comes before fall. TRUMP RAMPS UP HEAT ON HARVARD: HERE ARE 5 REASONS FROM THE UNIVERSITY'S OWN INVESTIGATION It could also be that Harvard’s dons, and especiallyits president, Alan Garber,had had just about enough of being a punching bag for students. They knew that fighting a president who is disdained by students and its very leftist professoriate alike would win it accolades from both. The Trump administration announced it was freezing over $2 billion in grants and contracts after Harvard University said it would not comply with federal demands regarding antisemitism.(Reuters/Nicholas Pfosi) It did at this year’s graduation on May 29. The New York Times gleefully reported that \"The mood atHarvard’s graduation ceremonyis vastly different from the scene at last year’s, where the university’s leadership was frequently booed and hundreds walked out in protest over the university’s handling of Gaza protests. This year,Alan Garber, the school president,has received multiple standing ovations.\" But that also could be very short-sighted. Argentine military dictator General Leopoldo Galtieri also received the almost unanimous adulation of his countrymen when he invaded the Falkland Islands in 1982. Then when British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher took the islands back in a very short war, the national mood turned very ugly, and Galtieri was overthrown. Trump’s and Harvard’s war of words started with a letter the administration sent the university back on April 11, outlining 10 demands. TRUMP FROZE FUNDING FOR HARVARD. MONEY TO THESE UNIVERSITIES MAY ALSO BE ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK The administration, for example, asked that Harvard make \"meaningful governance reform.\" It also requested that it institute merit-based hiring, giving it an August deadline to \"cease all preferences based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin throughout its hiring, promotion, compensation, and related practices among faculty, staff, and leadership.\" In other words, the administration asked Harvard to abide by the law. It also saidthe universityhad to reform international admissions so as to exclude \"students hostile to the American values and institutions.\" Again, common sense. Why would a university admit foreign students who hate Americans and their values? TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S EFFORTS TO DEFUND HARVARD DIVIDES CONSERVATIVES Some civil libertarians may have more trouble with the demand for Harvard to audit \"the student body, faculty, staff, and leadership for viewpoint diversity.\" But Harvard is precisely in its current pickle because for years it has hired only liberal professors, producing the ideological imbalance we have now in the faculty lounge. And nobody could argue with such administration demands as auditing programs and departments \"that most fuel antisemitic harassment,\" or discontinuing diversity, equity and inclusion \"programs, offices, committees, positions, and initiatives.\" Harvard faculty and staff hold signs from inside Harvard Yard during a press conference by faculty supporters of the Harvard Out of Palestine coalition outside Harvard Yard on May 10, 2024.(John Tlumacki/The Boston Globe via Getty Images) But Harvard did argue. On April 14, Garber fired back by writinga messageto Harvard’s stakeholders refusing all the demands. \"No government—regardless of which party is in power—should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue,\" he wrote. That very evening, Trump responded by freezing $2.2 billion in multi-year grants. And he hasn’t stopped. WHITE HOUSE SLAMS IVY LEAGUE INSTITUTIONS FOR 'EGREGIOUS ILLEGAL BEHAVIOR' AMID TRUMP FEUD WITH HARVARD Since then, Trump’s Department of Homeland Security moved on May 22 to revoke Harvard’s ability to enroll foreign students.Harvard Professor Kirsten Weldcalled it \"an extinction-level event,\" and it is easy to see why. Foreign students account for almost 7,000 of Harvard’s students or 27% of the student body in 2024-2025. But the cost of tuition would be even higher. Foreign students, unlike American ones, tend to pay full freight. The hit to tuition could be as high as 40%. Again, Harvard has a tough case to make. DHS saysHarvardhas allowed \"anti-American, pro-terrorist agitators\" to make campus unsafe for Jews on campus. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION But Trump has kept punching. He has threatened to revoke Harvard’s tax-exempt status and threatened to cancel all federal contracts with Harvard — around $100 million. Obviously, Trump has many arrows in his quiver, and even Harvard’s gargantuan $50 billion endowment could be threatened. In an interview with the BBC recently, a reporter asked me why Trump was pursuing his crusade with Harvard. Doesn’t he have bigger things to do, like the economy and foreign policy? It also said the university had to reform international admissions so as to exclude \"students hostile to the American values and institutions.\" Again, common sense. Why would a university admit foreign students who hate Americans and their values? I answered her that Trump may not have read much cultural Marxism, but he understands that this woke mind virus started at our universities, and at the highest level. American taxpayers kept sending money to universities because they thought they were centers where culture would be transmitted to future generations. Instead, cultural Marxists used them as venues to kill the culture. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP His fight with Harvard is a crusade, all right.

    "title": "I'm a physician and I'm worried that our health agencies are facing increasing chaos",
    "article_text": "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. discusses alarming findings in the ‘Make America Healthy Again’ Commission report on ‘The Will Cain Show.’ The American health system is bleeding out, and it desperately needs a real doctor. Leading Health and Human Services (HHS) today is like navigating a chaotic hospital — patients in every hallway, monitors screaming, seconds ticking away. Yet, instead of a seasoned physician who triages and trusts proven protocols, that hospital is overseen by an activist named Robert F. Kennedy Jr. A patient’s oxygen level plummets; nurses turn toHHS Secretary Kennedy.Instead of orders, they get a lecture on conspiracies. Chaos follows. CDC REMOVES COVID VACCINE RECOMMENDATION FOR HEALTHY CHILDREN AND PREGNANT WOMEN That chaos is now national. Our health agencies are trying to perform open-heart surgery while debating the effectiveness of a scalpel. Scientists who should be developing next-generation cancer vaccines are, instead, defending 60-year-old elementary science. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testifies before the House Appropriations Committee in the Rayburn House Office Building on May 14, 2025, in Washington, DC.(Getty Images) Conspiracy ideology is beginning to take over, and we’re all going to pay the price. I’m a board-certified physicianand one of the most-followed online, and since Kennedy took office, I’ve been forced to swap from fact-checking Instagram influencers to fact-checking the nation’s top public-health official. RFK JR'S HIGHLY ANTICIPATED MAHA REPORT PAINTS DISMAL STATE OF CHILD HEALTH, NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS Our nation’s health system is in shambles, and the leadership of HHS plays a pivotal role in fixing this disaster. That’s why it’s deeply alarming that Kennedy, who continues to spread misinformation and denies the fundamentals of medicine, remains at the helm of the agency. Althoughhe claims he’s \"not anti-vaccine,\"his words and actions tell a different story. He recklessly attacks vaccine efficacy, spreads disproven theories linking vaccines to autism, and denies fundamental virology — from diseases like HIV, measles, and more. I’m all for healthy skepticism, but scientific skepticism means investigating data, not cherry-picking it … or making it up. These aren’t privately held beliefs either — a post on his active X account states that the HPV vaccine \"increases cervical-cancer risk\" all despite mountains of real-world data showing up to 88% drops in cancer among vaccinated teens. Sweden, England, and even the CDC surveillance report plunging pre-cancer rates. Recently, he claimed, \"50% of the population is diabetic\" and that \"one out of every three kids\" already has the disease. In reality, true estimates put China’s diabetes prevalence around 12%, and the U.S. pediatric figure closer to one in 300. If one of my interns inflated numbers by a factor of 10, they’d be sent back to remedial math. Kennedy does it regularly on primetime television. TRUMP CLAIMS 'I DON'T KNOW HER' AND 'LISTENED TO' RFK JR ABOUT SURGEON GENERAL PICK GETTING MAGA PUSHBACK Worse, he’s now canceled$12 billion in disease outbreak preventionprograms, proposed a 26% cut to the NIH budget, and pink-slipped roughly 20,000 public-health scientists and staff. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Those decisions have consequences: dozens of federally funded vaccine clinics in Arizona, Minnesota, Nevada, Texas and Washington were canceled just asmeaslescases blew past 1,000 — the worst surge in a generation. He’s dismantling the firehousewhile buildings are burning. Public health cannot survive an HHS head who guts the programs that keep us safe and then fans the very myths that make outbreaks explode. Kennedy's long record of undermining proven public health measures and spreading scientific falsehoods makes him a threat to millions of Americans. Certainly, he should never have been confirmed to lead the office in the first place, but choosing to leave him in charge is like handing the keys to a driver who continues to insist that stop signs and red lights are optional. BEN & JERRY'S CO-FOUNDER ARRESTED PROTESTING SENATE HEARING: 'RFK KILLS PEOPLE WITH HATE' Today, I say that Kennedy is the wrong person to lead HHS.The integrity of our nation’s health agencies demands leadership grounded in facts, research, and transparency — not misinformation.

    "title": "US trade with the EU is out of whack. Trump needs to stay tough on tariffs to fix it",
    "article_text": "Former U.S. trade representative Michael Froman unpacks the 'back and forth' over tariffs on 'The Story.' President Donald Trump is threatening50% tariffs on all importsfrom the European Union if a trade deal can’t be reached by July 9.  The recent ruling from the Court of International Trade is unlikely to slow down Trump’s efforts, given the multitude of loopholes and a possible Supreme Court reversal. The outcry from Europe is loud and multilingual — and we need to ignore it. Early in my tenure as ambassador to the EU during Trump’s first term, I invited members of the European Round Table to lunch. I asked these CEOs of the biggest companies in Europe if they owned property in the U.S. All said yes. \"But how do you eat in America?\" I asked. \"What do you drive? Do you bring your cars and food with you?\" They laughed and said that the reluctance for our products has nothing to do with U.S. food or manufacturing. That those closed doors are Europeanprotectionism.In short, our cars are reliable, our vegetables healthy, they just want to win. When it comes to trade, they have won for decades and that has to change. TRUMP'S TOUGH POLICIES PUSH UK, EU TO SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND TRADE AND DEFENSE When Trump spoke with EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on May 25, she called her conversation with him, a \"good call\" and promised that \"Europe is ready to advance talks swiftly and decisively,\" tacking on: \"To reach a good deal, we would need the time until July 9.\" The U.S. has a long history with the EU and that's why Americans expect a fair deal from them. FILE: Flags from the 27 countries of the EU fly in the wind in front of the European Parliament on April 5, 2025, in Brussels, Belgium.(Thierry Monasse/Getty Images) What the two in conversation means is that the U.S. is now asking them to dig deep into their red lines when it comes to us.Europeloves a show without a result. I know what it’s like to negotiate with them — that they can move slower than a French escargot — and the result is escargot-sized too. It’s nice. It’s cosmetic. It’s meaningless. We’ve gotten into trade talks many times before, with leaders like von der Leyen pleading for more time, promising they’ll get serious. The reality is that they will have meetings but they will refuse to eliminate or even budge their red lines on trade for the United States. They have to. MUSK SAYS HE HOPES FOR 'ZERO TARIFFS,' FREEDOM OF TRADE ZONE BETWEEN US AND EUROPE America deserves to be treated differentlythan any other trading partner, and this counts for our asks with respect to China as well. If we are going to take up the weapons, the EU needs to back us on sanctions. We want the EU to come down on the countries in their bloc that are operating in their self-interest as opposed to contributing to the alliance’s economic interests. We deserve reciprocity on trade with concessions that are deep and material. The U.S.trade deficit with the EUis ballooning. It has gone from $45 billion in 1999 to $235 billion in 2024. If we include services last year, the trade deficit only reduces to $161 billion. U.S. presidents from Clinton to Trump were slapped with significant trade resistance from the EU. Unwilling to concede, even under unilateral pressure, they cried out about what they perceived to be U.S. overreach and always chose multilateral solutions — like reinforcing the WTO — to find perceived stability and predictability. When Trump said recently, \"They’ve treated us very badly over the years,\" he was spot on. SOME COUNTRIES TARGETED BY TRUMP TARIFFS SEEK NEGOTIATIONS, CHINA SAYS 'NO WINNERS IN TRADE WARS' In 1999, when President Bill Clinton was busy with the \"banana wars,\" arguing that American fruit importers should havefreer access to the EU market,the overall U.S. globaltrade deficitwas at a then-record of nearly $170 billion, with over $43 billion coming from the EU. In 2002, George W. Bush imposed steel tariffs to protect domestic producers, during a year when our trade deficit with the EU had risen to $86 billion. During Trump’s first term, our trade deficit went from $151 billion in 2017 to $182 billion in 2020. Now at $235 billion, you can understand why he’s pissed off. Trump is not negotiating, he’s deadly serious. He wants a fair share of their market and for the EU to treat us completely differently than any other trading partner because we’ve earned it. Not just from a decades-long trade imbalance, but from the security guarantee America has provided for just as long. They need to get over their stringentvalue-added tax,health and digital regulations and make choices that reflect our shared history. President Donald Trump has criticized the ever-growing trade deficit with Europe. FILE: Trump speaks at AmericaFest, Sunday, Dec. 22, 2024, in Phoenix.(AP Photo/Rick Scuteri) Trump is doing something stark and immediate as the EU gets ready to play rope-a-dope with us yet again. He is saying you can have all your regulations and juicy red European tomatoes, but you have to pay 50% tariffs. Is that really worth it? CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Europeans should be exposed to American products. Trump is not forcing anyone to buy them, just to have access. If the way Americans do things don’t meet with European taste or sensibility, then let the market speak for itself. And vice versa. All we’re asking for is a fair shot. WHICH COUNTRIES IMPOSE THE HIGHEST TARIFFS ON THE US? I predict the EU will waltz us through their organic, manicured gardens again with no result. I think Trump predicts this too. July 9 will roll in with no substantial concessions made by the EU, forcing the president to impose significant tariffs. They will cause extreme pain on both sides, but negotiations between us are like breaking a horse. Trump is bound and determined to not have them bend the knee, but rather to treat us differently than other trading partners. And when they do, I’m sure we will listen. If Americans like European products better than ours, fine. American manufacturers will have to figure it out. The U.S. trade deficit with the EU is ballooning. It has gone from $45 billion in 1999 to $235 billion in 2024. If we include services last year, the trade deficit only reduces to $161 billion. Readjusting the trade imbalance is not a lot of money in the grand scheme of things, but it’s a sign of gratitude and respect for what the U.S. has done in the last 80 years. Many Europeans still claim that the Marshall Plan was sponsored by the U.S. for Europe’s benefit and ours. That’s preposterous. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Think of it this way. If two friends, one richer, one poorer, go out to dinner regularly and the richer one always pays, that makes sense. If the poorer friend needs surgery and the richer one offers to cover it, that still makes sense. Theirs is a valued meaningful friendship after all. But if one day, the poorer friend comes into wealth and has the opportunity to help the person who has supported him consistently for decades and then refuses, there is a major problem. The U.S. and the EU are those two friends. No one wants this relationship to crumble, and all eyes are on the EU, because the world knows how long the U.S. has been picking up the check. We’re asking a friend a favor because it’s simply their turn to pay. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM GORDON SONDLAND Gordon Sondland served as the 20th U.S. ambassador to the EU.

    "article_text": "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt weighs in on key economic indicators improving and demands answers about who led the previous administration on 'Hannity.' This is the season of PresidentDonald Trump,theRepublican Party,conservatism and the MAGA movement. The Democratic Party is in dire straits. They sit at 21% approval in some polls. They have reduced themselves to defending illegals, gang members and other forms of criminality and corruption. They present no new ideas, just obstructionism. DEM STRATEGY SESSION TO STOP HEMORRHAGING OF MALE VOTERS RIDICULED And with each issue they embrace, such as opposing cuts in federal spending or defending the waste, fraud and abuse of USAID or other federal agencies, for that matter, only drives them further down in the polls. President Donald Trump is putting Republicans on the path to long-term victory. FILE: Trump applauds after completing his address to supporters following his Iowa caucus victory party in Des Moines, Iowa, on Monday, January 15, 2024.(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) They are also the party of antisemitism, repellent to most Americans who cherish our longtime friendship with the Jewish state. They have no answers to the ills afflicting Americans. DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S IMAGE IN WEAKEST POSITION SINCE REAGAN-BUSH ERA, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST SAYS Meanwhile, Trump and his Republican Party have a corner on the marketplace of ideas. From the border to inflation, the GOP has it all over theSad Sack Democrats. Democrats must hate getting up in the morning. The newspapers and cable television only bring them more bad news, from the new charges against  Andrew Cuomo, former Democrat governor of New York, to fresh revelations about the scandal of COVID-19 and the alleged criminality of Dr. Anthony Fauci, former chief medical advisor to the president, to Minnesota Democrat Rep. Ilhan Omar’s complete indifference to the murder of two young Israelis in Washington at the Israeli Embassy. Democrats must be asking themselves, \"What fresh hell is this?\" Of course, the story with the most damaging, long-term effect is the cover-up of former PresidentJoe Biden’s incipient mental state.Were we a constitutional republic during his time? Or were we governed bya devious cabalarmed with an autopen? MELISSA DEROSA: DEMOCRATS FACE A PAINFUL QUESTION: WHAT WENT WRONG? Even worse, the entire Democratic Party establishment was in on the cover-up and conspiracy of defending an emperor that not only had no clothes, but apparently wasn’t even governing in the first place. The GOP is on offense, a good place to be in politics. Meanwhile, the Democrats are in a fox hole, fighting off incoming, completely on the defense. Joe Biden reacts after his wife Jill Biden defended his record on \"The View.\"(ABC / Screenshot) This all has long-term consequences. Just as President Abraham Lincoln kicked off a long period of Republican governance beginning in 1860, just as FDR and the Democrats initiated a long period of Democratic governance beginning in 1932, Trump could be kicking off a long period of Republican governance. Republicans are in motion. Trump is in motion. He knows politics is motion. DAVID MARCUS: TRUMP'S BIG WIN MEANS REPUBLICANS HAVE A REAL SHOT AT GENERATIONAL POWER. DON’T SCREW IT UP During the Lincoln era, Republicans reminded voters of the \"bloody shirt\" to drive home to them it was Democrats, the party of slavery, who instigated the Civil War. Republicans will, in the future remind voters of the Biden cover-upby yelling, \"Deceitful Democrats!\" Watergate was indeed just a \"third-rate burglary\" compared to this culture wide scheme to deceive. The tea leaves were already appearing before thisearthshaking scandal surrounding Biden.Look at the facts: Hispanic men shifted in large numbers toward the Republicans in the last election. So too did African American males. So too did young voters. White Americans held firm in almost all categories. Democrats often delude themselves. Case in point is the growing vegetative state of Biden. And I am sorry, Minnesota’s Caspar Milquetoast governor Tim Waltz is not the answer to recapturing the male vote. TRUMP VICTORY SLAMS DEMOCRATS' WOKE WORLD VIEW. HERE'S WHAT'S NEXT The irony is that the insider establishment told themselves an old, old, old man, who was on the wrong side of all the issues, could win until it became screamingly obvious he could not. They then told themselves a lightweight do-nothing vice president, chosen for her race and sex and not for her intellect, could win. Ironically, she was chosen as Biden’s insurance plan meaning there would be no way anyone would turn to Kamala Harris if and when Biden faltered. Everybody knew she was completely unqualified to be president. Lord Acton once cynically said, \"The danger is not that a particular class is unfit to govern. Every class is unfit to govern.\" Maybe so, but the Democrats, as decided by the voters, are indeed unfit to govern. President Donald Trump could set in motion years of Republican political dominance, as President Abraham Lincoln did in his time. FILE: The Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.(iStock) The GOP controls the majority of governorships. The GOP controls the majority of state legislatures. And, in 23 states, the GOP has total control. The other states are at best mixed. Conservatives control the Supreme Court. KEY BIDEN STAFFERS ASKED TO TESTIFY ON ALLEGED ROLE IN MENTAL DECLINE ‘COVER-UP’ Beyond the growing powers of Trump are the issues that favor the GOP, abortion is now off the table as conservatives acted on their federalism instincts and the Supreme Court sent the matter back to the states where behavioral issues like marriage, adoption and the death penalty belong. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Anybody who looks beyond the point of their own nose has to see this massiveBiden cover-upis not only the greatest scandal in American history, but it will have significant ramifications for our future. Liberal historians’ credibility is shot. Jon Meacham, Michael Beschloss and others like them have no more authority. This has a significant impact on the future. True journalists will not be turning to them for comment as they are seen simply as liberal lackeys, especially Meacham who authored Biden’s \"Nuremberg Speech,\" denouncing half of America, one of the two worst speeches in presidential history, ranking with President Jimmy Carter’s now notorious \"Malaise\" speech. The liberal media,too, is headed for the ash heap of history. Where will CNN’s and MSNBC’s ratings be in a year? Their viewership may be higher in Beijing than in Peoria. And, ironically, CNN anchor Jake Tapper, just as his book is topping the charts, has destroyed his credibility by being part of the original cover-up as a Biden apologist. Of course, the story with the most damaging, long-term effect is the cover-up of former President Joe Biden’s incipient mental state. Were we a constitutional republic during his time?

    "title": "Invisible tax: Government debt is crushing your finances",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on senators pushing for changes to the House-passed spending bill as it moves to the Senate for debate. Mortgage rates rose again this week, with the average 30-year fixed rate climbing past 6.8%. That’s not just a post-pandemic hangover; it’s a warning sign. Behind the scenes,rising government debtis putting steady upward pressure on borrowing costs. If your mortgage, car loan, or credit card payments are more expensive than they were a few years ago, you’re not alone — and despite what you may have heard, it’s not just because of inflation or Federal Reserve policy. The surge in federal borrowing is helping inflate interest rates across the board. Ifgovernment debthad stayed at 2015 levels, the typical family could be paying $222 less per month on their mortgage. Go back to 2005 debt levels and the number jumps to $536. That’s real money disappearing from household budgets not because of the jump in home prices, but because Washington can’t stop borrowing. DAVID MARCUS: WHY NOBODY WANTS TO CUT THE NATIONAL DEBT DESPITE EVERYONE SAYING THEY SHOULD For years, economists puzzled over why interest rates kept falling. Aging populations, slower productivity, and foreign demand for American debt were all cited as reasons. One result was that Uncle Sam took advantage and racked uplarger deficits and debt. After all, refinancing was affordable at low rates. Another was that Americans got used to lower monthly mortgage payments, auto loans, and other interest rate-related expenses. Now, we’re grappling with interest rates that have surged and stayed stubbornly high. The change followed a torrent ofunfunded federal spendingin 2020 and especially 2021 which exploded the deficit, shook investor confidence in America’s long-term fiscal stability, and caused bond markets to react to policymakers’ fiscal bravado. My new research for the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, along with a growing body of economic literature, shows the debt itself is pushing up long-term interest rates — and by more than some experts are willing to admit. While broader economic changes and policy decisions also play roles, this particular problem is too big to ignore. Over time, as trillions of dollars in debt compound, the Treasury shells out hundreds of billions more in interest payments. It’s not just a problem for Washington’s balance sheet. It’s a problem for yours. Economists have a term for what’s happening: \"crowding out.\" When the government borrows more, it competes with private borrowers for capital. And when two consumers want the same thing, the price usually goes up — in this case, the price of borrowing (interest rates). All kinds of important things become more expensive: mortgage payments, car loans, student loans, credit card debt. These are not abstract concerns. They determine whether plenty of families can afford to buy a home, send someone to college or buy a new car or truck. They determine whether someone can start or expand a business and provide more people with jobs. Take housing. Mortgage rates are now hovering near their highest levels in over 20 years. That’s not because lumber or labor costs spiked, but because of the effects of federal borrowing. Student loan interest rates are tied to Treasury yields, which means college graduates are now repaying debt at the highest rates in almost two decades. Auto loan rates are rising too, pricing out lower-income consumers. For Americans with credit card debt (almost half of U.S. households carry a balance) the average interest rate is now around 20%, driven in part by the same upward pressure caused by growing federal debt. Thesedebt-driven rate increasesare an invisible tax on all of us. Families feel the squeeze every month. Businesses delay investments. Budding entrepreneurs face higher hurdles. Why aren’t more economists talking about the problem? It’s complicated. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), for example, significantly underestimates the effect. Its latest projections assume long-term interest rates will stabilize at lower levels even as government debt as a share of the economy grows. But if debt pushes rates up more than the CBO predicts — as most empirical studies now show — then its rosy forecasts won’t reflect how much the federal government will pay just in interest. Beyond our own households, there are consequences for the whole economy and government. Higher interest costs mean less money for education, infrastructure, or tax relief. They increase the risk of a debt spiral in which interest payments themselves become the fastest-growing part of the budget. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Most people understand that the federal government’s borrowing binge can’t go on forever, and that it will burden future generations of taxpayers. But if you’re between the ages of 19 and 99, the tax is probably already hitting you in some way each and every month. The cost of inaction isn’t just abstract and long-term, it’s concrete and already being felt. Just check your mortgage statement.

This time, he’s on the other side, lobbying lawmakers on legislation related to autonomous vehicles, according to areport by Bloombergthat cited unnamed sources. Musk and others in his orbit have been calling members of Congress directly, according to Bloomberg. His efforts appear to be directed at a bill introduced May 15 called theAutonomous Vehicle Acceleration Act. Musk has bet much of Tesla’s future on AI, robotics, and autonomous vehicles. He has frequently tied the company’s value to its investment and eventual commercialization of autonomous vehicles. And next month, Tesla is expected to launch a small andgeofenced robotaxi servicein Austin, Texas. Tesla also wants to eventually roll out autonomous vehicles — branded Cybercabs — that don’t have a steering wheel or pedals. But today there are not clear federal rules or standards to allow such a vehicle to operate at scale. Topics Think you know AI? Prove it.

From what TechCrunch staff has witnessed firsthand, the X website and app still loaded, but various features were not functioning properly, and entire feeds — like X’s algorithmic For You feed — didn’t load any content.

X: the nothing apppic.twitter.com/6sD88Ldh5S Based on the timing of the user reports, the outage and errors seem to have begun just before 4 p.m. ET on Friday and seem to be resolving as of the time of writing. During the outage,thousands of users submitted reports to Downdetector,and others more directly complained in X posts and on other social networks, like Bluesky and Threads. This was the second outage for X in just over a week, as the service also failedon May 22,when X experienced a number of issues over a 24-hour period. During that time, messages wouldn’t load, timelines wouldn’t update, and some posts couldn’t be seen without refreshing the webpage. The current outage may be short-lived. We noticed that some features seemed to either be intermittently working, or worked on X’s mobile app but not on the desktop, for instance. Then, people began reporting that the service seemed to have come back up. The X Developer API v2 is stillshowingdegraded status, however. Just ahead of the outage, X beganrolling out its new DM feature, XChat, into beta afterpausing encrypted DMsas it worked to make improvements. It’s not clear if any of these changes impacted X’s stability, and the company no longer responds to press inquiries since Musk took ownership.

It might have been a short week, but there was still plenty of news, including anotherZooxrecall, an update on theStellantis-Amazonpartnership, and a few startup-funding deals. One item of note: This week, I wrote aboutCarma Technologyand itspatent infringement lawsuitagainstUber. This isn’t a patent troll situation, and the IP attorneys I have spoken with say it will be a challenging case for Uber. The gist? Carma, which was formed in 2007 by serial entrepreneur and SOSV Ventures founder Sean O’Sullivan, filed a lawsuit earlier this year against Uber, alleging the company infringed on five of its patents that are related to the system of matching riders (or packages) with capacity in vehicles. In other words, ride-sharing. IP attorney Larry Ashery provided the money quote that explains why this is such a complicated and challenging case. “What’s important to understand here is, Carma isn’t just asserting five patents. They have had a very sophisticated strategy of patent procurement that they’ve been working on for the past 18 years.”Carma’s five patents are part of a 30-patent family that are all related and connected to the original filing date. That matters because each of the five asserted patents contains multiple patent claims, which define the legal boundaries of the invention. These individual claims — not just the patents as a whole — are what Carma is asserting against Uber. That means Uber will have to address and defend against each asserted claim, making the litigation more complex and difficult to defeat, Ashery noted. Let’s get into the rest of the news. A few little birds have been chirping at us for months now about a new autonomous vehicle technology startup that has been quietly plugging along for a year. The interesting nugget about this startup — which is calledBedrock Robotics— is who is behind it:Boris Sofman, who ledWaymo’s self-driving trucks program and previously co-founded and led the popular consumer robotics companyAnki. The San Francisco-based startup is still in stealth, but my sources tell me it has raised considerable venture funds. Bedrock Robotics is working on a self-driving kit that retrofits onto construction equipment and other heavy machinery,according to a filingwith the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

Firefly Aerospacereceived a$50 million investmentfrom Northrop Grumman as part of its Series D round. This investment will further advance production of the startup’s  co-developed medium launch vehicle, now known as Eclipse. Pallet, a warehouse logistics software startup based in Fremont, California,raised $27 millionin a Series B funding round led by General Catalyst. Bain Capital Ventures, Activant Capital, and Bessemer Venture Partners also participated. Volteras, a London-based startup building virtual connective tissue that will allow plugged-in EVs to offer their batteries to support the grid, closed an$11.1 million Series Aled by Union Square Ventures, with participation from Edenred, Exor, Long Journey Ventures, and Wex. Way Data Technologies, a fleet management startup founded by veterans of Lucid Motors and Wolt,raised €2.6 million($2.95 million) in pre-seed funding led by Pale Blue Dot, with participation from 10x Founders and Greens Ventures. Rivr’sfour-wheeled, stair-climbing delivery robot— which its CEO and founder, Marko Bjelonic, describes as a dog on roller skates — will ferry packages fromVehovans directly to customers’ front doors as part of a pilot program in Austin, Texas. Both companies see this small pilot as a critical step toward solving a unique slice of the end-to-end autonomous delivery journey. TuSimple(now CreateAI)sent a trove of sensitive data— effectively the blueprint of an American-made autonomous vehicle system — to a Beijing-owned firm after committing to the U.S. government that it would cease such transfers under a national security agreement. The revelation, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, prompted numerous “not surprised” responses from several readers and sources within the industry. Zooxissued itssecond voluntary softwarerecall in a month, following a collision between one of its robotaxis and an e-scooter rider in San Francisco on May 8. The incident is notable, largely for what happened after the unoccupied Zoox vehicle operating at low speed was struck by the e-scooter after braking to yield at an intersection. According to Zoox, the e-scooterist fell to the ground directly next to the vehicle and the “robotaxi began to move and stopped after completing the turn, but did not make further contact with the e-scooterist.” In other Zoox news, the company announced it was the “official robotaxi partner of Resorts World Las Vegas.” As part of the deal, there will be a dedicated and Zoox-branded robotaxi pickup and drop-off location at Resorts World Las Vegas. TheTesla Cybertruckis having a rough time. Dozens of unsold Tesla Cybertrucks arepiling up at a Detroit shopping center parking lot. And while Cybertruck owners are now allowed by Teslato trade in their vehiclesfor the first time since they hit the market, they’ll face a steep depreciation hit. CarGurus recently showed depreciation rates of up to 45%. Meanwhile,Teslasales in Europe and the U.K.have fallen by nearly half, according to data released by the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. TheVolkswagenemissions cheating scandal of 2015 rippled through the automotive sector and prompted the company (and later followed by others) to shift away from diesel and toward hybrids and electric vehicles. Now, four former Volkswagen executives havereceived prison sentencesfor their role. Amazonis no longer working withStellantisto createin-car software for the automaker’s vehicles. The partnership, first announced in January 2022, was part of Stellantis’ plan to generate $22.5 billion annually from software.

The statement from the executive, George Moose, comes just a few days after a federal judgeruledthat DOGE’s takeover of the nonprofit was illegal. And this week, Musk has claimed he is stepping away from DOGE, although he and President Trump have said he will continue to advise the administration. DOGEstarted its takeoverof USIP in mid-March after a standoff that saw the nonprofit call the police on Musk’s government workers. Moose said at the time that DOGE staff had “broken into” the USIP headquarters in Washington, despite the fact that the nonprofit is not part of the executive branch and isn’t subject to the White House’s whims. “It was very clear that there was a desire on the part of the administration to dismantle a lot of what we call foreign assistance, and we are part of that family,” Moose said at the time, referencing the Trump administration’s and DOGE’s dismantling of the United States Agency for International Development. Moose initiallysaidthe nonprofit’s headquarters appeared to be in decent shape at a press conference on May 21, where he discussed the judge’s ruling. But one day later, according to the statement, members of Moose’s staff spent a day surveying the building and documenting the problems they found. Moose wrote in his statement that, ahead of the judge’s ruling, the headquarters had been “essentially abandoned for many weeks” before USIP regained control. He said that DOGE had failed to “maintain and secure the building,” including “evidence of rats and roaches.” “Vermin were not a problem prior to March 17, 2025, when USIP was actively using and maintaining the building,” Moose wrote. Staff also reported to Moose that the building’s vehicle barriers were poorly maintained and that they spotted water leaks and “missing ceiling tiles in multiple places in the building (which I have been told suggest likely water damage).” Now Moose said USIP has “engaged a private security firm to guard the building and premises” and “taken over responsibility for the building’s maintenance.” Topics Sr. Reporter, Transportation Think you know AI?

Venture capitalist Mary Meeker just droppeda 340-page slideshow report— which used the word “unprecedented” on 51 of those pages — to describe the speed at which AI is being developed, adopted, spent on, and used, backed up with chart after chart. “The pace and scope of change related to the artificial intelligence technology evolution is indeed unprecedented, as supported by the data,” she writes in the report, called “Trends — Artificial Intelligence.” There’s a certain poetic history to this person writing this kind of report. Meeker is the founder and general partner at VC firm Bond and was onceknown as Queen of the Internetfor her previous annual Internet Trends reports. Before founding Bond, she ran Kleiner Perkins’ growth practice, from 2010-2019, where she backed companies like Facebook, Spotify, Ring, and Block (then Square). She hasn’t released a trends report since 2019. But she dusted off her skills to document, in laser detail, how AI adoption has outpaced any other tech in human history. ChatGPTreaching800 million users in 17 months: unprecedented. The number of companies andthe rate at which so many othersare hitting high annual recurring revenue rates: also unprecedented. The speed at which costs of usage are dropping: unprecedented. While the costs of training a model (also unprecedented) is up to $1 billion, inference costs — for example, those paying to use the tech — has already dropped 99% over two years, when calculating cost per 1 million tokens, she writes, citing researchfrom Stanford. The pace at whichcompetitors are matching each other’s features, at a fraction of the cost, including open source options, particularly Chinese models: unprecedented. For example, she points out that Nvidia’s 2024 Blackwell GPU uses 105,000x less energy per token than the company’s 2014 Kepler GPU predecessor. Meanwhile, chips from Google, like its TPU (tensor processing unit), andAmazon’s Trainium, are being developed at scale for their clouds — that’s moving quickly, too. “These aren’t side projects — they’re foundational bets,” she writes. The one area where AI hasn’t outpaced every other tech revolution is in financial returns. WhileVCs are pouring moneyon the AI fire as fast as they can, AI companies and cloud service providers are also burning through cash. AI requires massive investments in infrastructure. That’s good for consumers and enterprises, the beneficiaries of fast improvements, while competition lowers costs, Meeker points out. But the jury is still out over which of the current crop of companies will become long-term, profitable, next-generation tech giants. “Only time will tell which side of the money-making equation the current AI aspirants will land,” she writes.

Large corporations and growing startups were caught up in the decision. Energy secretary Chris Wright said the moves were “due diligence” on the part of the Trump administration. His statement did not cite specific reasons why the projects were canceled, but pointed to amemorandumhe issued on May 15, which suggests that the department may attempt to use its audit powers to rescind the awards. In total, 24 projects are affected by the move, including ones being developed by oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil, food manufacturer Kraft Heinz, industrial heat startup Skyven, cement and alumina startup Brimstone, and cement startup Sublime Systems. Here’s a sampling of some of the awards in jeopardy: Sublime told TechCrunch that it was caught off guard. “Sublime was surprised and disappointed to receive the news about the termination of our Industrial Demonstrations Program award, given the clear progress we’ve made in scaling our American-invented technology, partnering with some of the Western World’s largest cement producers, and generating a bankable customer base,” spokesperson Rob Kreis said via email. The startup is evaluating its options to continue scaling up its operations. Brimstone is hopeful that things can be resolved with the DOE. “Given our project’s strong alignment with President Trump’s priority to increase U.S. production of critical minerals, we believe this was a misunderstanding. Brimstone’s Rock Refinery represents the only economically viable way to produce the critical mineral alumina in the U.S. from U.S.-mined rocks,” Brimstone spokesperson Liza Darwin told TechCrunch via email. “As the first U.S.-based alumina plant in a generation, our project — which would also make portland cement — would clear a ‘mine-to-metal’ path for U.S. aluminum production, fortifying the U.S. critical mineral supply chain and creating thousands of jobs,” she added.

Ina blog posttitled “Returning to Core” published Thursday evening, Automattic announced it will unpause its contributions to the WordPress project. This is despite having said only last monththat the 6.8 WordPress releasewould be the final major release for all of 2025. “After pausing our contributions to regroup, rethink, and plan strategically, we’re ready to press play again and return fully to the WordPress project,” the new blog post states. “Expect to find our contributions across all of the greatest hits — WordPress Core, Gutenberg, Playground, Openverse, and WordPress.org. This return is a moment of excitement for us as it’s about continuing the mission we’ve always believed in: democratizing publishing for everyone, everywhere,” it reads. Automattic says it’s learned a lot from the pause in terms of the many ways WordPress is used, and that it’s now committed to helping it “grow and thrive.” The post also notes that WordPress today powers 43% of the web. It’s unclear what has changed. However, according to sources who spoke to TechCrunch, Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg explained in an internal post published last night that he wants to get a 6.9 release out this year with an admin refresh and something from the “new AI team.” (The latter references this week’s announcement thatWordPress formed a new team to steward the development of AI projects.) “I don’t think that will happen without our contributions,” the post stated, according to a source familiar with the internal discussions. Insiders are speculating there’s more to it than that, and various theories are being floated. Some wonder if Mullenweg was pressured into this move or if he realized that pulling back wasn’t good for his business or its reputation? Others are debating if this change of heart has to do with Automattic’s ongoing litigation with WordPress’ hosting company, WP Engine, which Automattic has called a “threat” to the WordPress communityand a “cancer to WordPress.” No one knows what to believe, and none of these backchannel theories line up with the officially stated reason. Automattic was asked for additional comment. Since 2024, Automattic has been engaged in a legal dispute that has to do with how little, in Mullenweg’s opinion, WP Engine contributes to the WordPress project, despite its size and revenue. He sees the hosting company as profiting off the open source work WordPress is doing without giving back. Mullenweg also alleges that WP Engine benefits from the confusion between WordPress and commercial services like WP Engine. This led him to ban the company from accessing WordPress.org and sue in court forunauthorized trademark usage. Simply put, Mullenweg thinks WP Engineshould either paya direct licensing fee or up its contributions to the open source WordPress project, or shouldn’t be allowed to use its trademark. WP Enginerespondedthat it doesn’t think it needs a license and that Automattic misunderstands trademark law,suing Automattic in return. Last month,Automattic laid off 16% of staff,saying the restructuring was necessary to be more agile and improve its productivity and profitability.

This week brought more than justNvidia’s earnings reports; startups and VCs also had some news — quieter perhaps, but still worth paying attention to, especially where AI is involved. AI once again drove a large share of overall startup activity, including one acquisition, but this week also brought us a reminder that full M&A execution takes time — and that VC funding is not the only route. Good optics:AMDacquired Enosemi, a startup designing custom materials to support silicon photonics product development, under undisclosed terms. The goal of the acquisition is to “accelerate [AMD’s] co-packaged optics innovation for AI systems.” Onboarded:AI startup Anthropicadded Netflix co-founder Reed Hastingsto its board of directors. Hastings was appointed by Anthropic’s independent Long-Term Benefit Trust and already has experience sitting on the boards of Netflix, Bloomberg, Meta, and Microsoft.

But it’s not just him: Musk’s stint is alsocoming to an end. Bootstrapped:Ten-year-old cybersecurity company Thinkst Canary reached$20 million in annual recurring revenue without VC investment— an interesting story that seemed worth mentioning before diving into funding news. Funding news this week comes from a mix of announcements and rumors — unconfirmed but well-sourced. Let’s start with these before moving on to the more concrete updates. Musk again:Neuralink, Elon Musk’s brain implant startup, reportedly raised$600 million at a $9 billion pre-money valuation. Long arm: Samsung is said to be looking to invest ina $100 million round for medical device startup Exothrough its venture investment arm. New horizon: Filings revealed that cybersecurity startup Horizon3.ai isseeking to raise $100 million, out of which it has already secured at least $73 million. New bricks: Buildots, a Chicago-based startup leveraging AI and computer vision to improve construction progress tracking, raiseda $45 million Series D, bringing its total raised to $166 million. Adding up:Rillet, a startup using machine learning and generative AI to automate accounting reports,raised a $25 million Series Aled by Sequoia Capital, only 10 months after a $13.5 million seed and pre-seed round.

It would share similarities with the AI modelreleased by competitor Odysseythis week. Advanced grid: Gridcare, an AI-powered energy optimization startup, emerged out of stealth withan oversubscribed $13.5 million seed roundand said it’s ready to play matchmaker between data centers and utilities. Diversifying: State-owned Saudi AI company Humain is making progressto launch Humain Ventures, a $10 billion venture fund that will invest in startups in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. Kiwi startups: Auckland-based venture firm and incubator Outset Venturesclosed a second fundof approximately $25 million to invest in deep tech startups emerging out of New Zealand.

Carma Technology, a company formed in 2007 by serial entrepreneur andSOSVfounder Sean O’Sullivan, filed a lawsuit earlier this year against Uber alleging the company infringed on five of its patents that are related to the system of matching riders (or packages) with capacity in vehicles. In other words, ridesharing — a business Carma operated in some form for a decade until it changed its business model and applied its tech to road-pricing services like GPS tolling and HOV verification. Carma has requested a jury trial and is seeking a permanent injunction against the company, mandatory future royalties on any Uber products that infringe on those patents as well as damages, and other costs related to the lawsuit. The lawsuit, which has been quietly winding its way through the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, is relatively new. The allegations have been swirling for nearly a decade. Carma lawyers first contacted Uber about its ridesharing and ground transportation patents in 2016, according to the complaint. That was an auspicious time for Uber. The startup, which was founded just seven years before, had shot into the stratosphere — in terms of valuation, growth, and gravitas. Uber wasvalued at $66 billionat the time, and had a reputation for takingbig, legally sticky swingsinto new markets that helped it grow to hundreds of cities in the U.S., Europe, Canada, and the Middle East. It had raised more than $12.5 billion in venture capital, and was using it to launch new products and evenpush into autonomous vehicles. Uber might have had the business model and the market share, but it didn’t have the specific ridesharing patents, O’Sullivan told TechCrunch in a recent interview. Carma does — plus acouple dozen others. Uber was allegedly aware of that fact as early as 2015 when the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office rejected one of its applications because it ran up against existing patents held by O’Sullivan and Carma, according to the lawsuit. At least four of Uber’s patent applications — and in some cases numerous revisions to those patents — were rejected between 2016 and 2019 for the same reason. The rideshare giant would eventually abandon some of those applications. Uber still holds hundreds of other patents covering a broad swath of technology and ideas that have been applied to its business. O’Sullivan argues the core service of what Carma’s patents describe is exactly how the modern day ridesharing experience operates. And he contends that Uber is infringing on those patents even if the company’s business model operates more like a taxi business. The case is a complicated one, intellectual property attorney Larry Ashery told TechCrunch. (Ashery is not involved in the case.)“What’s important to understand here is Carma isn’t just asserting five patents,” said Ashery, whose practice is based in the Greater Philadelphia area. “They have had a very sophisticated strategy of patent procurement that they’ve been working on for the past 18 years.” He noted the five patents are part of a 30-patent family that are all related and connected to the original filing date. That matters because each of the five asserted patents contains multiple patent claims, which define the legal boundaries of the invention. These individual claims — not just the patents as a whole — are what Carma is asserting against Uber. That means Uber will have to address and defend against each asserted claim, making the litigation more complex and difficult to defeat, he noted. Ashery said Uber’s strategy will likely be to try to invalidate these patents, which will be a challenge. While Carma might have been armed with these specific patents, it took nine years for the company to actually sue Uber. Bunsow De Mory, a Redwood City-based law firm, is representing Carma in the case. “When any business starts, it’s all about just actually capturing the market and winning in the marketplace,” O’Sullivan said. “Patents are meant to protect against aggressors from stealing the idea, but it’s not the main focus of your business to get patent revenue. It’s more as a protective mechanism.” Carma, he said, has been “very busy building a multimillion-dollar business and getting to profitability.” But there are other reasons for that nine-year time gap, O’Sullivan explained. For one, the cost. “It’s incredibly expensive to sue a large company over IP and Carma is a relatively small organization,” he said in a recent interview. “To come up with the $10 million-plus to take on a big patent suit, which is what it takes these days, is not a small task.” O’Sullivan said the company did reach out to Uber as far back as 2016 “in the hopes that they would do the right thing and license our patents.” “It really took us a while to come to terms with the idea that we actually had to sue Uber in order for them to respond,” he added. Uber declined to comment on the lawsuit. Uber’s attorneys did make two procedural motions this week, including a sealed motion to dismiss for improper venue or alternatively to transfer venue for convenience. This procedural motion signals Uber’s desire for the case to be litigated in the Northern District of California, where it is based, rather than in Texas. Notably, the lawsuit is aimed at Uber, not Lyft or other companies using ridesharing. O’Sullivan explained Carma is “going after the biggest player first” and noted that about 60 other companies are likely infringing on its patents. The primary argument in the lawsuit ties back to five patents that have been granted to O’Sullivan and Carma, which was originally named Avego. It all started with O’Sullivan’s frustration with traffic congestion, which ultimately led to thoughts about carpooling and how an automated system using smartphones could help people coordinate rides. That idea would turn into the startup Avego and become the basis of the first patent —No. 7,840,427. The first patent, which O’Sullivan applied for in 2007 and was granted in 2010, created a shared transport system that matches empty space in a vehicle with riders or goods. The system established a set of pick-up and drop-off points and then matched users and drivers traveling along a similar route. Before the patent was granted Avego’s ridesharing app debuted on Apple’s App Store in 2008, the same year the iPhone launched. Avego showed off its so-calledShared Transport appat the DEMO conference in 2008, which showed how a driver with an iPhone 3G could use the app to accept or reject a ride request. Once accepted, the rider was notified as the driver approached and then was prompted to enter a pin code to prove their identity and authorize an electronic payment. Avego, which would later change its name to Carma, was focused on the promotion of ridesharing (as in carpooling) and not taxis, according to O’Sullivan. The company operated the carpooling business until October 2016, when the app was withdrawn from the App store. However, it still had other forms of ridesharing, like its partnership with Toyota, until phasing it out altogether in April 2018. “If you look at the definition of ridesharing in federal legislation, it is carpooling,” O’Sullivan said, noting that Carma built up a multimillion-dollar ridesharing business in its early days. When Uber and Lyft came in and tried to co-opt the term ridesharing to mean taxi-hailing it caused confusion in the market, prompting Carma to change its business model and apply its tech in new ways. “Uber and Lyft really took ridesharing in the direction of taxi services, but our company Carma didn’t want to,” O’Sullivan said. Carma is still focused on reducing traffic congestion, but its tech is applied to a different business model. Today, Carma uses its app to help transit authorities manage tolls and express lanes — a product line the company first rolled out in 2013. For instance, the app can be used by a driver on a toll road or even track vehicle occupancy for HOV lanes. The app is designed to get more riders into cars and reward those people by reducing tolls or giving drivers access to the HOV lane. The idea, O’Sullivan said, is to offer toll authorities a way to reduce capital expenditure by up to 20 times by not using large gantry-based infrastructure systems. And it has paid off. O’Sullivan says Carma is profitable, although pursuing this lawsuit will cut into its bottom line. Still, he said it’s worth the cost. “I think there’s a danger in society where we can’t rely on our patents to protect the rights of the inventors, and the patent system exists specifically to protect the rights of investors, not to reward copycats that just happen to have deeper pockets,” he said, pointing to Uber’s attempts at its own patents and the rejection of them by the USPTO. “We think it’s something that’s important to recognize that the rights of a relatively small inventor are being trampled upon. But it’s not just for Carma, really. We think of this as a problem for the entire system. It’s a test of whether the rule of law still applies when a powerful tech giant is involved.” Topics Transportation Editor Think you know AI? Prove it.

The ruling concluded a legal battle spanning more than five years, which started in October 2019 whenWhatsApp accused NSO Groupof hacking more than 1,400 of its users by taking advantage of a vulnerability in the chat app’saudio-calling functionality. The verdict came after a weeklong jury trial that featured several testimonies, including NSO Group’s CEO Yaron Shohat and WhatsApp employees who responded and investigated the incident. Even before the trial began, the case had unearthed several revelations, including that NSO Grouphad cut off 10 of its government customersfor abusing its Pegasus spyware,the locations of 1,223 of the victimsof the spyware campaign, and the names of three of the spyware maker’s customers: Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and Uzbekistan. TechCrunch read more than 1,000 pages of court transcripts of the trial’s hearings. We have highlighted the most interesting facts and revelations below. Thezero-click attack, which means the spyware required no interaction from the target, “worked by placing a fake WhatsApp phone call to the target,” as WhatsApp’s lawyer Antonio Perez said during the trial. The lawyer explained that NSO Group had built what it called the “WhatsApp Installation Server,” a special machine designed to send malicious messages across WhatsApp’s infrastructure mimicking real messages. “Once received, those messages would trigger the user’s phone to reach out to a third server and download the Pegasus spyware. The only thing they needed to make this happen was the phone number,” said Perez. NSO Group’s research and development vice president Tamir Gazneli testified that “any zero-click solution whatsoever is a significant milestone for Pegasus.” Following the spyware attack, WhatsApp filed its lawsuit against NSO Group in November 2019. Despite the active legal challenge, the spyware maker kept targeting the chat app’s users, according to NSO Group’s research and development vice president Tamir Gazneli. Gazneli said that “Erised,” the codename for one of the versions of the WhatsApp zero-click vector, was in use from late 2019 up to May 2020. The other versions were called “Eden” and “Heaven,” and the three were collectively known as “Hummingbird.” Contact UsDo you have more information about NSO Group, or other spyware companies? From a non-work device and network, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, oremail. For years, NSO Group has claimed that its spyware cannot be used against American phone numbers, meaning any cell number that starts with the +1 country code. In 2022,The New York Times first reportedthat the company did “attack” a U.S. phone but it was part of a test for the FBI. NSO Group’s lawyer Joe Akrotirianakis confirmed this, saying the “single exception” to Pegasus not being able to target +1 numbers “was a specially configured version of Pegasus to be used in demonstration to potential U.S. government customers.” The FBIreportedly chosenot to deploy Pegasus following its test. NSO’s CEO Shohat explained that Pegasus’ user interface for its government customers does not provide an option to choose which hacking method or technique to use against the targets they are interested in, “because customers don’t care which vector they use, as long as they get the intelligence they need.” In other words, it’s the Pegasus system in the backend that picks out which hacking technology, known as anexploit, to use each time the spyware targets an individual. Shohat disclosed a small but notable detail: NSO Group and its parent company, Q Cyber, have a combined number of employees totaling between 350 and 380. Around 50 of these employees work for Q Cyber. In a funny coincidence, NSO Group’sheadquartersin Herzliya, a suburb of Tel Aviv in Israel, is in the same buildingas Apple, whose iPhone customers are also frequently targeted by NSO’s Pegasus spyware. Shohat said NSO occupies the top five floors and Apple occupies the remainder of the 14-floor building. “We share the same elevator when we go up,” Shohat said during testimony. The fact that NSO Group’s headquarters are openly advertised is somewhat interesting on its own. Other companies that develop spyware or zero-days likethe Barcelona-based Variston, whichshuttered in February, was located in a co-working space while claiming on its official website to be located somewhere else. During their testimony, an NSO Group employee revealed how much the company charged European customers to access its Pegasus spyware between 2018 and 2020, saying the “standard price” is $7 million, plus an additional $1 million or so for “covert vectors.” These new details were included in a court document without the full context of the testimony, but offers an idea of how much advanced spyware like Pegasus can cost paying governments. While not explicitly defined, “covert vectors” likely refer to stealthy techniques used to plant the spyware on the target phone, such as azero-click exploit, where a Pegasus operator doesn’t need the victim to interact with a message or click a link to get hacked. Theprices of spyware and zero-days can vary dependingon several factors: the customer, given that some spyware makers charge more when selling to countries like Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates, for example; the number of concurrent targets that the customer can spy on at any given time; and feature add-ons, such as zero-click capabilities. All of these factors could explain why a European customer would pay $7 million in 2019,while Saudi Arabia reportedly paid $55 millionandMexico paid $61 millionover the span of several years. During the trial, Shohat answered questions about the company’s finances, some of which were disclosed in depositions ahead of the trial. These details were brought up in connection with how much in damages the spyware maker should pay to WhatsApp. According to Shohat and documents provided by NSO Group, the spyware maker lost $9 million in 2023 and $12 million in 2024. The company also revealed it had $8.8 million in its bank account as of 2023, and $5.1 million in the bank as of 2024. Nowadays, the company burns through around $10 million each month, mostly to cover the salaries of its employees. Also, it was revealed that Q Cyber had around $3.2 million in the bank both in 2023 and 2024. During the trial, NSO revealed its research and development unit — responsible for finding vulnerabilities in software and figuring out how to exploit them — spent some $52 million in expenses during 2023, and $59 million in 2024. Shohat also said that NSO Group’s customers pay “somewhere in the range” between $3 million and “ten times that” for access to its Pegasus spyware. Factoring in these numbers, the spyware maker was hoping to get away with paying little or no damages. “To be honest, I don’t think we’re able to pay anything. We are struggling to keep our head above water,” Shohat said during his testimony. “We’re committing to my [chief financial officer] just to prioritize expenses and to make sure that we have enough money to meet our commitments, and obviously on a weekly basis.” First published on May 10, 2025, and updated with additional details.

Wiles reportedly told people that her phone was hacked. The Wall Street Journalfirst reportedthe hack of Wiles’ phone. CBS Newsalso confirmedthe reporting. The hacker or hackers are said to have accessed Wiles’ phone contacts, including the phone numbers of other top U.S. officials and influential individuals. The WSJ reports some contacts received phone calls impersonating Wiles, which used AI to impersonate her voice and sent text messages from a number not associated with Wiles. White House spokesperson Anna Kelly would not say, when asked by TechCrunch, if authorities had determined if a cloud account associated with Wiles’ personal device was compromised, or if Wiles’ phone was targeted by a more advanced cyberattack, such as one that involves the use of government-grade spyware. In response, the White House said it “takes the cybersecurity of all staff very seriously, and this matter continues to be investigated.” This is the second time Wiles has been targeted by hackers. In 2024,The Washington Postreported that Iranian hackers had attempted to compromise Wiles’ personal email account. The Journal said Friday, citing sources, the hackers were in fact successful in breaking into her email and obtained a dossier on [Vice President] JD Vance, then Trump’s running mate. This is the latest cybersecurity incident to beset the Trump administration in the months since taking office. In March, former White House top national security adviser Michael Waltzmistakenly added a journalistto a Signal group of top White House officials, including Vance and Wiles, which included discussions of a planned military air-strike in Yemen.

The companyannouncedThursday that users no longer have to tap an option to summarize an email with AI. Instead, the AI will now automatically summarize the content when needed, without requiring user interaction. When Gemini launched in the side panel of Gmail last year, one of the features allowed users to summarize their long email threads, along with other tools like those to draft email messages or see suggested responses, among other things. Now, Google is putting the AI to work on your inbox, whether or not it’s something you want to use. The update is another example of how AI is quickly infiltrating the software and services people use the most, even though AI summariesaren’t always reliable. When Apple rolled out AI summaries for app push notifications, for example, the BBC found the feature made repeated mistakes when summarizing news headlines. Apple ended uppausing the AI summariesfor news apps. Google’sown AI Overviews feature for Search hasalso repeatedly mademistakes, offering poor quality and inaccurate information at times. With the new email summary cards, Gemini will list a longer email’s key points and will then continue to update that synopsis as replies arrive. The feature won’t replace the option to manually click a button to summarize an email, Google notes. That will still appear as a chip at the top of the email and in Gmail’s Gemini side panel. The feature is initially available only for emails in English. Depending on your region, the summary cards may beturned onor off by default. (For instance, smart features are turned off in the EU, the U.K., Switzerland, and Japan, Google’s help documentation notes.)

The Times reports that over the course of last year, his drug consumption went beyond recreational use. He reportedly carried a medication box with 20 pills, which included Adderall. Sources told the outlet that his use of ketamine was so rampant that it affected his bladder. Musk’s use of drugs like ketamine, psychedelic mushrooms, and ecstasy iswell-documentedand reportedly a source of concern for board members at the numerous companies he runs, like Tesla and SpaceX. The latter is a large government contractor and must maintain a drug-free workplace. The Times report claims Musk received advanced notice of drug tests. It’s not clear if his erratic behavior, like insulting cabinet members,doing the Nazi salute, andjumbled speechduring earnings calls and other events were directly correlated to his reported drug-taking. The report also details how Musk’s increasing embrace of right-wing politics coincided with family troubles, like his custody battle with the musician Grimes over their five-year-old son, known as X. Musk announced this week that he wasending his stintwith the government and stepping back from politics to focus on his businesses.

Siemens EDA, Cadence Design Systems, and Synopsys all confirmed that they have received notices from the U.S. Commerce Department about new export controls on electronic automation design (EDA) software to China. EDA tools are primarily used to aid with the design and validation of semiconductor manufacturing and testing, as well as for monitoring performance and quality. They are used by chip foundries, chipmakers, networking hardware companies, the automotive industry, and many more. Siemens EDA, a division of German tech conglomerate Siemens, told TechCrunch that it has received a notice from the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) last week about new export controls on EDA software to China and Chinese military end users. “Siemens has supported customers in China for more than 150 years and will continue to work with our customers globally to mitigate the impact of these new restrictions while operating in compliance with applicable national export control regimes,” the company said. U.S.-based Synopsys, which also makes EDA software,saidon Thursday that it had also received a similar letter from the BIS. The company also suspended its forecast for the third quarter and full-year 2025. Cadence alsoreceiveda notice from the BIS saying a license is now required for “the export, re-export or in-country transfer of electronic design automation software” to customers in China. The news was firstreportedby The Financial Times. The new export rules come as the U.S. ramps up its efforts to hinder Chinese companies as the battle for AI supremacy heats up. But these export controls are increasingly hurting the U.S. chip industry, which has long enjoyed significant market share in China. Nvidia alone hasincurred billions in lossesdue to restrictions on sales of its H20 and Hopper AI chips to Chinese customers. The company, along with rival AMD, is evensaid to beworking on selling lower-powered versions of its AI chips to Chinese customers. The U.S. Commerce Department did not immediately return a request for comment outside regular business hours. Topics Editor, TC+ Think you know AI? Prove it.

As a result of the deal, Misfits Market plans to take on over 250 items from The Rounds’ inventory. This allows the company to diversify into additional categories, such as household items, including cleaning supplies and paper products. In a bid to transition The Rounds customers to Misfits Market, the company is offering a $30 credit, along with a complimentary one-year subscription to its new Misfits+ membership, which includes exclusive weekly deals and free shipping. The company declined to disclose the terms of the deal. It also couldn’t confirm whether layoffs would be part of the acquisition, as decisions are still being finalized. The Rounds has raised a total of $66 million from investors such as Andrew Chen (Andreessen Horowitz), Annie Kadavy (Redpoint Ventures), Construct Capital, and First Round Capital. Along with diversifying its offerings, the deal will allow Misfits Market to collaborate with former partners from The Rounds, including major multifamily operators such as AvalonBay, Greystar, and Related. Misfits Market also aims to gain a stronger foothold in the industry as a result of the deal. Notably, the company will continue to pursue M&A as part of a broader growth strategy, especially at a time when consumer awareness of food waste and sustainability is on the rise. “This market is ripe for consolidation, and we are constantly looking at deals,” Misfits Market CEO Abhi Ramesh told TechCrunch. This marks Misfits Market’s second acquisition, following its purchase ofImperfect Foodsin 2022, another competitor in the market. Misfits Market, founded in 2018, offers produce that has been rejected by farmers and suppliers for being considered too “ugly” to sell in grocery stores, often due to being too small, oddly shaped, or having discoloration. The Rounds, meanwhile, has offered its sustainable grocery delivery service since 2019 that refills home essentials using reusable packaging. To date, Misfits Market has rescued more than 238 million pounds of food, according to the company. The Rounds has savedover 1 million poundsof packaging waste and estimates to save an average of 500,000 pounds of food each week. Topics Think you know AI? Prove it.

    "title": "Idyllic Swiss village stood for centuries - until a roaring glacier wiped it out",
    "article_text": "The village of Blatten has stood for centuries, then in seconds it was gone. Scientists monitoring the Nesthorn mountain above the village in recent weeks saw that parts of it had begun to crumble, and fall on to the Birch glacier, putting enormous pressure on the ice. Small rock and ice slides had begun to come down, and the village’s 300 residents, and even their livestock, were evacuated for their own safety. But everyone hoped the unstable rock would disperse incrementally over a few weeks, and that after that everyone could go home. On Wednesday afternoon, that hope was dashed. Nine million cubic metres of rock and ice came crashing down into the valley It was such a force that it registered on every geological monitoring station in Switzerland Barbara and Otto Jaggi, in the neighbouring village of Kippel, were getting their chimney fixed. The repairman was downstairs checking the system, when suddenly Barbara said: “There was loud banging, and the lights went out.” At first, she and Otto thought the repairman had broken something, but then the banging, and now roaring, got louder, and the repairman came running up the stairs to them shouting “the mountain is coming”. Kippel is over 4 km (2.5 miles) from Blatten. It and the entire valley were soon cloaked in dust. Blatten itself was completely destroyed; its homes, its church, its cosy Edelweiss hotel smashed to rubble. Geologists had been monitoring the situation; that’s why Blatten was evacuated. But no-one, not even the experts, expected such huge violence. Blatten's church andHotel Edelweisswere landmarks in the small village nestled in the Lötschental valley Both were destroyed by the tons of ice, rock and mud - the church buried and only the hotel's roof visible among the debris “I was speechless,” said Matthias Huss, a leading glacier specialist at Zurich’s Federal Institute of Technology. “It was the worst case that could happen.” Mr Huss had been aware of the situation in Blatten; he and his team check Switzerland’s glaciers all year round, and their annual reports show a clear, accelerated thaw, linked to global warming. Blatten is now buried in rock and mud, and the clean-up operation is on hold because the tonnes of debris have blocked the River Lonza, causing a flood risk. So it is too soon to do a complete analysis of how exactly this disaster happened. But Matthias Huss points out that while Blatten may be the biggest, most dramatic alpine disaster in recent years, it isn’t the only one. “We are seeing many,” he said, “and lots of these events in the last years in the Alps are linked to global warming. “There seems to be a link that's quite clear because the warming is affecting permafrost thaw and the permafrost is what stabilises these high mountains.” Blatten was evacuated before the landslide because of concerns about the glacier The nearby villages of Wiler and Kippel are now at risk of flooding from the melting ice Permafrost is often called the glue that holds the mountains together. When it thaws, the mountains crumble, and they start to break apart. At the same time, the glaciers are shrinking and, as they do, they uncover mountainsides that are unstable without their thick coat of ice. These hazards are not entirely new. Glaciers do grow, retreat, and then grow again over centuries. Seasonal avalanches and landslides tend to have their regular paths down the mountains. Alpine communities are used to this, and Switzerland has been extensively risk-mapped. One of the reasons villages like Blatten are where they are is precisely because they are not seen to be in the path of danger. But over the last 20 years there has been a fundamental change. The glaciers, and the permafrost, are melting faster than ever. The volume of ice is less than half what it was a century ago, and some glaciers have disappeared altogether, prompting alpine communities to hold funerals for them. If global warming does not stay within the 1.5C rise agreed in the Paris climate accord, glaciologists believe most of Switzerland’s glaciers will be gone by the end of this century. Until now the big worry has been the loss of a key, fresh water supply. Glaciers, often called the water towers of Europe, store the snow in winter, and release it gradually over the summer, filling rivers, and irrigating crops. But Blatten has sounded new alarm bells. Despite all the monitoring and risk-mapping, the rapid thaw is making it very hard to accurately predict the danger. Blatten’s residents were evacuated, but it was thought of as a precautionary measure, while the unstable rock and ice came down gradually. The authorities didn’t want anyone to get hurt. Although one man aged 64 is missing, the evacuation saved hundreds of lives. But Blatten’s people lost everything else. Barely a house has been left standing, everything is buried under tonnes of rock and mud. Mr Huss fears that Blatten may be a sign of things to come. “It really puts a question mark on living in the high mountains,” he says. “And I wouldn't exclude that in the future also other villages are going to be destroyed.” One day after the tragedy in Blatten, locals gathered at the church in the neighbouring village of Wiler to mark Ascension Day. Prayers were said for those who had lost their homes, and for the future of the community. “We all know each other around here,” said one woman. “Our valleys are small, that brings us closer together. There is real compassion.” Others though voiced the fear that has spread right across the country. “It's terrible. They've lost everything. There's nothing we can do,” said another woman. “We can cry, but we cannot cry forever,” added an elderly man. “We must believe in God, that He will help us, so that life can go on.” Or, as Matthias Huss put it, “This is really an event that will be quite decisive for Switzerland, and how we perceive the mountains.” Produced by Dominic Bailey, Mike Hills and Tom Finn.

    "title": "Taylor Swift buys back her master recordings",
    "article_text": "Taylor Swift has bought back the rights to her first six albums, ending a long-running battle over the ownership of her music. \"All of the music I've ever made now belongs to me,\" said the star, announcing the newson her official website.\"I've been bursting into tears of joy... ever since I found out this is really happening.\" The saga began in June 2019, when music manager Scooter Braun bought Swift's former record label Big Machine and, with it, all of the songs from Taylor Swift, Fearless, Speak Now, Red, 1989 and Reputation. Swift had personal objections to the deal, blaming Braun for complicity in the \"incessant, manipulative bullying\" against her by Kanye West, one of his clients. On her website, Swift said that reclaiming the rights to her music had, for a long time, seemed unimaginable. \"To say this is my greatest dream come true is actually being pretty reserved about it,\" she added, thanking fans for their support as the drama played out. \"I can't thank you enough for helping to reunite me with this art that I have dedicated my life to, but have never owned until now. \"I almost stopped thinking it could ever happen, after 20 years of having the carrot dangled and then yanked away,\" she wrote. \"But that's all in the past now.\" In the music industry, the owner of a master recording controls the way it is distributed and licenced. The artist still earns royalties, but controlling the masters offers protection over how the work is used in future. Swift responded to the original sale of her masters by vowing to re-record those records, effectively diminishing the value of those master tapes, and putting ownership back in her hands. To date, she has released four re-recorded albums - known as \"Taylor's Versions\" - with dozens of bonus tracks and supplementary material. In her letter, the star told fans she had yet to complete the project, after \"hitting a stopping point\" while trying to remake 2017's Reputation album - which dealt with public scrutiny of her private life, and the fall-out of her feud with Kanye West. \"The Reputation album was so specific to that time in my life,\" she explained. \"All that defiance, that longing to be understood while feeling purposefully misunderstood... \"To be perfectly honest, it's the one album in those first six that I thought couldn't be improved by re-doing it... so I kept putting it off.\" Last week, the star previewed the new version of Reputation's first single, Look What You Made Me Do, in an episode of The Handmaid's Tale - but her letter suggested that a full re-recording would be delayed or even scrapped. However, she promised that vault tracks from the record would be released at a future date, if fans were \"into the idea\". She also confirmed that she had re-recorded her self-titled debut, adding: \"I really love how it sounds now\". \"Those two albums can still have their moments to re-emerge when the time is right,\" she added. \"But if it happens, it won't be from a place of sadness and longing for what I wish I could have. It will just be a celebration now.\" As the name suggests, a master recording is the original recorded performance of a song. Whoever owns it controls all the rights to exploit the music. That includes distributing it to streaming services, pressing new physical CDs and vinyl, creating box sets, or licensing songs to movies or video games. Swift, as the writer or co-writer of her music, always maintained her publishing rights, which meant she was able to veto attempts to license songs like Shake It Off and Love Story to other companies. \"I do want my music to live on. I do want it to be in movies. I do want it to be in commercials. But I only want that if I own it,\" she told Billboard in 2019. It is not known how much it cost Swift to acquire her masters, but the catalogue previously sold for $300m (£222m) in 2020. The BBC understands that rumours she paid between $600m to $1bn are inaccurately high. When 14-year-old Taylor Swift moved to Nashville in 2004 to chase her dream of becoming a country pop star, she signed a record deal with Big Machine. Label boss Scott Borchetta gave the unproven singer a big cash advance in exchange for having ownership of the master recordings to her first six albums \"in perpetuity\". This was fairly common practice in the era before streaming, when artists needed record label backing to get played on the radio, and for the manufacture and distribution of CDs. Swift's deal with Big Machine expired in 2018, at which point she left and signed with Republic Records and Universal Music Group (UMG). A year later, Borchetta sold his label to Scooter Braun's Ithaca Holdings. Swift said she only learned about the deal when it was announced; characterising it as an act of aggression that \"stripped me of my life's work\". She labelled Braun - who rose to prominence as the manager of Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande - as \"the definition of toxic male privilege in our industry\". She also expressed frustration that she had been unable to make a counter offer for her music. \"I spent 10 years of my life trying rigorously to purchase my masters outright and was then denied that opportunity,\"she told Billboard, adding that: \"Artists should maybe have the first right of refusal to buy.\" Braun later told Variety that the dispute had \"gotten out of hand\" after he and his family received death threats. The music mogul later sold his stake in Swift's back catalogue to Shamrock Holdings, a Los Angeles investment fund founded by the Disney family in 1978, in November 2020. The multi-million dollar deal left Swift feeling betrayed again. \"This is the second time my music had been sold without my knowledge,\" she said in a social media post. While she was \"open to the possibility of a partnership with Shamrock\", she subsequently learnt that, under the terms of the sale, Braun would \"continue to profit off my old music\" for years. \"I simply cannot in good conscience bring myself to be involved in benefiting Scooter Braun's interests,\" she wrote in a letter to the company, which she posted on X. She began releasing her re-recorded albums in 2021, starting with her breakthrough, coming-of-age album Fearless. Produced with forensic attention to detail, they were often indistinguishable from the originals - albeit with slightly cleaner mixes, and greater separation between the instruments. But the big attraction was the bonus tracks, including the unabridged, 10-minute version of her break-up ballad All Too Well - described by Variety magazine as the \"holy grail\" of the star's back catalogue. The song went on to top the US charts, and made number three in the UK - where it is the longest song ever to reach the top five. In the meantime, the singer continued to release original material, including the Grammy Award-winning albums Folklore and Midnights. In 2023, Forbes magazine reported that Swift had become the first musician to make $1 billion (£740 million) solely from songwriting and performing. Half of her fortune came from music royalties and touring, while the rest came from the increasing value of her music catalogue, including her re-recordings. Revisiting the old material also inspired Swift's career-spanning Eras tour, which made more than $2 billion (£1.48 billion) in ticket sales across 2023 and 2024. In her letter, Swift said the success of the Eras tour \"is why I was able to buy back my music\". She added that she was heartened to see her struggle inspiring other artists. \"Every time a new artist tells me they negotiated to own their master recordings in their record contract because of this fight, I'm reminded of how important it was for all of this to happen. \"Thank you being curious about something that used to be thought of as too industry-centric for broad discussion. \"You'll never know how much it means to me that you cared. Every single bit of it counted, and ended us up here.\" The Colombian pop star says she is \"devastated\", after also cancelling her previous show in Boston. It was 25 years ago that the Dubliner's life changed forever when she shot to fame as a 17-year-old with debut single Gotta Tell You. Hull City Council hopes to submit another bid in 2027 to become a City of Music. St Peter's Church in Poole is hosting a concert series aimed at putting it on the live music map. The singer's music has been called delicate and otherworldly. Get to know them before everyone else.",

    "title": "Breakthrough cancer drug doubles survival in trial",
    "article_text": "Hundreds of thousands of people with advanced head and neck cancer could live longer without their cancer returning thanks to an immunotherapy drug, a clinical trial suggests. This is the first sign of a breakthrough for patients with this difficult-to-treat cancer for 20 years, say scientists behind the research. Laura Marston, 45, from Derbyshire, says she is \"amazed she's still here\" after being given \"dire\" chances of survival following a diagnosis of advanced tongue cancer six years ago. She received the immunotherapy before and after surgery, which researchers say helps the body learn to attack the cancer if it returns. Cancers in the head and neck are notoriously difficult to treat and there's been little change in the way patients are treated in two decades. More than half those diagnosed with advanced head and neck cancers die within five years. Laura was given only a 30% chance of surviving that long after her diagnosis in 2019, after having an ulcer on her tongue which wouldn't go away. The next step was major surgery to remove her tongue, as well as lymph nodes in her neck, and then she had to learn to talk and eat again. \"I was 39 and I was devastated,\" she told BBC News. As part of an international study into new ways to treat the cancer, involving experts from the Institute of Cancer Research in London, Laura was one of more than 350 patients given the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab before and after surgery to prime the body's defences. Prof Kevin Harrington, who led the trial in the UK, explains: \"We give the immune system the chance to have a good look at the tumour to generate anti-tumour immunity and then, after removal of the tumour, we continue to amplify that immune response by giving the drug continually for up to a year.\" A similar number of patients diagnosed with similar cancers received the usual care offered. They all had advanced head and neck cancers in one area, that had not spread to the rest of the body. The new approach showed positive results. It doubled the length of time patients were cancer free, on average, from around 2.5 years to five years. After three years, patients given pembrolizumab had a 10% lower risk of their cancer returning elsewhere in the body. Six years on, Laura is working full-time and says she's \"in a good place and doing really well\". \"It's been phenomenal for me, because I'm here, able to talk to you. \"I wasn't expected to come this far,\" Laura says. \"My prognosis was quite dire.\" She had muscle taken from her left arm and placed into her mouth to fill the void left by her tongue. It has been a tough journey. \"Just having this amazing immunotherapy has given me my life back again.\" The researchers say the key to their results was giving patients the drug before surgery, which trains the body to hunt down and kill the cancer if it ever comes back. Prof Harrington says immunotherapy \"could change the world\" for these patients. \"It significantly decreases the chance of cancer spreading around the body, at which point it's incredibly difficult to treat,\" he said. About 12,800 new head and neck cancer cases are diagnosed in the UK every year. The approach worked \"particularly well\" for some patients, but it was \"really exciting\" to see the treatment benefitting all the patients in the trial, Prof Harrington said. He added that it should now be made available on the NHS, . The study findings are being presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting. The trial, called Keynote, involved 192 hospitals in 24 countries, was led by Washington University Medical School in St Louis and funded by drug company MSD. The former president announced earlier this month he had an \"aggressive form\" of prostate cancer. The musician and charity fundraiser died last month aged 66 after living with cancer for 30 years. Szubanski is best known for her iconic role as Sharon Strzelecki in Australian sitcom Kath & Kim. The actress, 41, reveals she has had preventative surgery after learning she carries the BRCA gene. Castle Hill Hospital will now offer the use of VR headsets to cancer patients of any age.",

    "title": "UK taxpayers no longer own NatWest - but 17 years on, are banks safer from collapse?",
    "article_text": "The Treasury has announced the sale of its final shares in the NatWest Group. It means the bank will be under full private ownership, almost two decades after it was bailed out by the taxpayer amid the 2008 financial crisis. This marks a symbolic end to a dramatic chapter in British banking history. It was gone midnight – the early hours of Monday 13 October 2008 - when Chancellor Alistair Darling turned in for the night, leaving a team of officials, surrounded by curries and pizza boxes, finalising the detail of the biggest state intervention in the private sector since World War Two. The next morning he announced the first instalment of a rescue that would cost the taxpayer more than the entire defence budget. In total the government spent £45bn (£73bn in today's money), buying an 84% stake in the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), which now trades as part of the NatWest Group. At the time, RBS's balance sheet (outstanding loans) was bigger than the entire UK economy. Its collapse would have devastated it. The question is, why has it taken some 17 years for the Treasury to sell the last of its stake? And given that in the decades since fresh risks have emerged - including the threat of a cyber attack from a hostile state - how vulnerable does that leave UK banks today? Are they still \"too big to fail\", as they were widely described in 2008 - and were Britain to face another financial crisis, would the taxpayer have to step in once again to deliver a bailout? The current chair of NatWest group, Rick Haythornthwaite, has told the BBC that the bank and its employees remain thankful for that intervention in 2008. \"The main message to the taxpayer is one of deep gratitude,\" he says. \"They rescued this bank. They protected the millions of businesses and home-owners and savers.\" A lot has changed since 2008. Gone are £1.5 trillion in outstanding loans, gone are tens of thousands of employees in job cuts, and gone is around £10bn of taxpayers' money – never to be recouped. The amount spent by the government looks like a poor investment, but as Baroness Shriti Vadera – former senior adviser to the government and chair of asset manager Prudential - told the BBC, this wasn't an investment, it was a rescue. \"Nationalising RBS was hardly a voluntary investment,\" she says. \"What was important then was assessing the impact of RBS and other banks on the overall economy and in particular the ability to keep functioning – lending, putting cash in ATMs. \"It was never about saving the banks, it was about saving the economy from the banks.\" The consequences of a banking collapse would have been serious. The prime minister, Gordon Brown, even talked about putting soldiers on the streets. In a book by ex-Labour spin doctor Damian McBride, Brown is quoted as saying: \"If the banks are shutting their doors, and the cash points aren't working, and people go to Tesco and their cards aren't being accepted, the whole thing will just explode. \"If you can't buy food or petrol or medicine for your kids, people will just start breaking the windows and helping themselves.\" RBS was of course not the only bank that faced collapse. A tsunami of bad loans had been triggered by an earthquake in the US mortgage market. Risky loans to borrowers with low credit ratings had been packaged up and sold to banks around the world. By 2007, no-one knew exactly where these grenades were hidden in bank balance sheets, so they all stopped lending to each other – which saw the whole global financial system seize up. Northern Rock relied on borrowing funds to finance its own risky mortgages and in 2007, the BBC reported that it had turned to the Bank of England for help. This prompted a \"run on the bank\", which finally saw it fully nationalised in February 2008. Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, worked as the Bank's Chief Cashier during those turbulent months. He says if the state hadn't nationalised RBS, the costs would have been \"incalculable\". \"It would have been huge, because we were talking about the collapse of the banking system as we knew it at that time,\" recounts Bailey. US Banks were also in deep distress. In March 2008, Bear Stearns was absorbed by Wall Street rival JP Morgan. In September of that year, US mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were nationalised. Here in the UK, HBOS was absorbed by Lloyds and then of course, Lehman Brothers failed – defying expectations that the US government would step in to save it. But for the UK economy, RBS was the big one. The UK had a large banking sector, compared to the size of its economy; and within that mix, RBS was a particularly important bank. The once sedate RBS had become in some measure the biggest bank in the world. In 2000, it bought NatWest and just a year before the crash, it had bought Dutch bank ABN Amro. Its buccaneering boss Fred Goodwin had been knighted for his services to banking. But Mr Goodwin became a lightning rod for public outrage at the risks banks had taken and the bonuses their executives had collected. He left with an annual pension of £700,000 but was later stripped of his knighthood. The years following the rescue saw thousands of companies complain that the bankers RBS appointed to help them out of the crisis were driving them to the wall, forcing them into bankruptcy or selling their businesses at knock-down prices. RBS was the poster child for banking recklessness, hubris, greed and cruelty. Why then did it take so long for the government to sell out of RBS - at a loss of £10bn? At the same time the government took a stake in RBS, it also took a stake in Lloyds. But that was sold in May 2017, yielding a profit of £900m. RBS was infinitely more complicated than Lloyds as it had a large US business which was the subject of lengthy investigations by the US Department of Justice. The prospect of heavy fines hung over the bank for many years and proved well-founded when it was fined $4.9bn (£3.6bn) in 2018 for its role in the US mortgage crisis. RBS was also a pretty unattractive investment. It announced a £24bn loss for 2008 – the biggest loss in UK corporate history. It made losses every year until 2017. With the shares depressed by these concerns, the government was reluctant to sell its stake at low prices as it would crystallise a politically uncomfortable loss for the taxpayer. After all, following 2010, austerity was the name of the game and the then-Chancellor George Osborne could ill afford to be seen to be chalking up losses by selling RBS shares when he was making cuts elsewhere. But many think that was a mistake as – chicken and egg-like – it prolonged the reluctance of private shareholders to buy stakes in a company majority-owned by the government. As Baroness Vadera puts it: \"I'm not sure it was necessary to take 17 years to reverse out of the shares.\" Mr Haythornthwaite, who took on the role of NatWest Group chairman in April last year, describes the sale of the final shares as a \"symbolic\" moment for the bank, its employees, investors - but also on a wider scale. \"I hope it's a symbolic moment for our nation [too],\" he says. \"That we can put this behind us. It allows us to truly look to the future.\" But how exactly does that future look - and have lessons from the past really been learnt? Andrew Bailey certainly thinks so. He says that if a bank faces collapse now, it's less likely the taxpayer will have to step in. There are now alternative methods of rescuing a failing bank, he says, including buying assets and providing emergency cash. \"The big distinction is that we think we can handle [bank crises] without using public money,\" Bailey says. \"The critical thing is that we have to preserve the continuity of their activities, because they are critical to the economy … critical to people. \"When we say we've solved 'too big to fail', to be precise, I think what we mean is we don't need public money.\" It is true that the Bank of England now stress-tests banks much more rigorously to see how they would cope under pressures like a collapse in house prices, rocketing unemployment or rampant inflation. Sir Philip Augar, a veteran of the City of London and author of multiple books on banking, agrees that British banks are in a more resilient position now than they were in 2008 - essentially because they hold more cash in their coffers, rather than just relying on debt. \"What's happened to improve things since then is that the amount of leverage in the system has come right down, and the capital cushion that banks have to hold […] has increased substantially. So it's less likely now that a bank would collapse - but it's not impossible.\" Today, there are also new risks to consider. Take the series of cyber attacks that recently hit the systems of household names like Marks and Spencer, Co-op and Harrods. Should an attack take out critical banking functions like business lending, company payrolls and ATMs, it would be far more damaging. Indeed, in what he calls the \"league table\" of financial risks, Andrew Bailey identifies the threat of a cyber attack as a rapidly growing one. \"Of course you have to mitigate it, but [cyber] is a risk that will never go away, because it continually evolves,\" he says. \"We're dealing with bad actors who will continually refine the lines of attack. And I always have to say to institutions, 'You've got to continue to work at this'.\" Recent bank collapses in the US – like Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank - have highlighted another major risk. Customers don't have to queue round a block to get their money out; it can be done with the stroke of a key on a laptop or mobile in seconds. Banks are built on trust: customers put money in, believing they can get it out again whenever they want.  And a good old-fashioned bank run is now a modern digital bank run. But banks are still not like normal companies. They are not standalone entities but interconnected, and together they form the bloodstream of the economy. They are the arteries through which credit is extended, wages are paid, savings are stashed or withdrawn. And when those arteries get blocked, bad things happen. That is as true today as it was in 2008.

    "article_text": "Following some cooler and showery weather this week, temperatures are on the rise across England and eastern Wales to mark the end of May with a few locations expected to reach 26C (79F) on Saturday. Spring has already been confirmed as thesunniest on record, with temperature and rainfall close to record breaking levels too. Sunday 1 June marks the start of summer on the meteorological calendar. Warmer for much of England and Wales into this weekend Not all parts of the country will experience the warmth this weekend as high pressure will only influence conditions across parts of England and Wales. Meanwhile, low pressure systems will continue further north - bringing showers or longer spells of rain to northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland over the next few days, with maybe even an isolated thunderstorm. Despite this, temperatures will remain slightly above average, and it will feel pleasant whenever the sun breaks through the shower clouds. Warmth across the south will be short-lived with unsettled weather returning to all next week June is the first month of meteorological summer, so it is not unusual to have hot spells of weather. It's all down to the position of the jet-stream and ultimately the pressure pattern set up. Some computer models are hinting at a hotter spell unfolding towards the end of the first week of June, as we may import a plume hot air from the near continent. However, it's too early to say for certain. The chance of a hot, and potentially humid spell of weather could also come with the risk of some bigger thunderstorms which can often bring a lot of rain in a short space of time for some. The sun reaches the highest point in the sky and therefore its peak strength during June â especially around thesummer solstice.  Whatever the temperature, it's worth remembering thatUV levelscan still be high even on a cloudy June day. Grass pollen also peaks in June, often making this a miserable time of year for hay fever sufferers.The pollen count tends be lowerin cooler and showery weather conditions, so the lack of high temperatures and wall-to-wall sunshine could be a welcome relief to many.

    "article_text": "King Charles III received a Rolls-Royce as a coronation gift, an official register has revealed. Buckingham Palace has released records listing the official gifts received by members of the Royal Family from 2020 to 2023. The Rolls Royce Cullinan Series II motor car was given by the King of Bahrain Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa. It is thought to be worth at least £300,000, and will be used on official occasions and not for personal use. Other gifts on the list also included a feather crown from Amazonian Indigenous leaders, two gold Blue Peter badges and a tea set from Smythson of Bond Street. In April 2023, just before his coronation, the King received two gold Blue Peter badges, one each for himself and Camilla. They received the famous badges for their environmental work, support for young people through the Prince's Trust, now the King's Trust, and work highlighting the importance of literacy and reading from a young age respectively. For the coronation itself, alongside the Rolls-Royce, the Bahraini king gave Charles a decorative clock. Meanwhile, former President of the United States Joe Biden gave Charles a leather folder containing printed letters between Elizabeth II and President Dwight Eisenhower inviting him to the United Kingdom, with a photograph of the visit. The list also includes gifts presented to other members of the royal family including the Prince and Princess of Wales and the late Queen Elizabeth II. For her Platinum Jubilee, the late queen was gifted two lamp-posts which stand outside the Houses of Parliament in the form of bronze sculptures of heraldic beasts and a Cedar of Lebanon tree from Pope Francis. Official gifts can be worn and used, but are not considered the royals' personal property. The royals do not pay tax on them. Gifts cannot be sold or exchanged - though perishable official gifts with a value less than £150 can be given to charity or staff - and eventually become part of the Royal Collection, which is held in trust for successors and the nation. Usually the palace releases records listing the official gifts received by members of the royal family annually, however due to delays caused by the Covid pandemic, death of Elizabeth II and the coronation this is the first time a list has been published in the King's reign.

    "title": "M*A*S*H actress Loretta Swit dies aged 87",
    "article_text": "Loretta Swit, who won two Emmy awards for her role on the popular comedy TV series M*A*S*H, died on Friday, according to her representative. She died at her home in New York at age 87, her publicist Harlan Boll told the BBC. She likely died of natural causes, although a coroner's report is pending. On M*A*S*H, Swit played US Army nurse Major Margaret \"Hot Lips\" Houlihan. The series, which followed a mobile Army surgical hospital during the Korean war, ran for 11 seasons from 1972 to 1983. Swit was nominated for numerous awards, and appeared in nearly every episode of the series, including the finale which attracted a record 106m US viewers. The show remains one of the most successful and acclaimed series in US television history. Its season finale was the most watched episode of any TV series in history when it ended in 1983. As \"Hot Lips,\" Swit played a tough but vulnerable Army nurse who gained the nickname after having an affair with Major Frank Burns, who was played by Larry Linville. The show used comedy and pranks to tackle tough issues like racism, sexism and the impacts of PTSD within the military, at a time when US forces were withdrawing from Vietnam and dealing with the consequences of that conflict. It was based on the 1968 book, \"MASH: A Novel About Three Army Doctors,\" penned by a former Army surgeon. Swit was born Loretta Szwed in New Jersey and trained at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City. Along with M*A*S*H, she also appeared in numerous other TV shows, movies and even game shows over her career. She took to the Broadway stage in plays including Same Time, Next Year;  Mame; and Shirley Valentine - a role for which she won Chicago's top theatre prize, the Sarah Siddons Award. Her TV work included appearances on The Muppet Show, Mission: Impossible and Murder, She Wrote. In addition to her Emmys, Swit was nominated for four Golden Globe awards. \"Acting is not hiding to me, it's revealing. We give you license to feel,\" she said in an interview with the Star magazine in 2010. \"That's the most important thing in the world, because when you stop feeling, that's when you're dead.\" Speaking to an author about her character on M*A*S*H she said: \"Around the second or third year, I decided to try to play her as a real person, in an intelligent fashion, even if it meant hurting the jokes. ... She was a character in constant flux; she never stopped developing.\" Swit was also an artist and animal rights activist, and established a charity to campaign against animal cruelty, according to a statement from her publicist Mr Boll. Jamie Farr, who also starred in M*A*S*H as Corporal Klinger, called Swit his \"adopted sister\". \"From the first time I met her, on what was supposed to be a one-day appearance on M*A*S*H, we embraced each other and that became a lifetime friendship,\" Farr said in a statement. \"I can't begin to express how much she will be missed.\"",

    "title": "School leavers party for weeks on midnight buses, and Norway says it's gone too far",
    "article_text": "After 13 years of school, Selma Jenvin-Steinsvag and her classmate Aksel were running to catch the Oslo metro in red overalls. \"After that all our written exams will be done,\" said Selma, 18. The sight of school-leavers, known here asrusse, walking around in colourful overalls is something of a coming-of-age tradition that brightens up the weeks before Norway's national day on 17 May. That marks the day therussecan finally relax after their exams and have one final party. But for increasing numbers of young Norwegians, the parties have been starting weeks earlier, well before their exams have finished. And there is one side to the celebrations that has increasingly alarmed parents and politicians alike - therussebuss. \"It's a party bus! We go out every night for a month, we get drunk, we're partying with our friends and it's just fun!\" says 19-year-old Edvard Aanestad, who is finishing school on the west side of Oslo. The fear is that all the weeks of partying as well as the peer pressure involved are having a detrimental effect on teenagers' overall wellbeing, as well as their grades. A small fortune is often spent renting the buses and decking them out and many school-leavers go into debt to pay for it all. \"Arussebussdrives all night from around midnight until early morning. We play really, really loud music and party all night,\" says Edvard's friend, Henrik Wathne, who's 18. Alongside all the fun, there have been complaints that the celebrations result in heavy drinking, drug use and little sleep. There are also concerns that many teenagers feel left out because they cannot afford the cost. And all of it currently coincides with the exam period. Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store said last year that he too had enjoyed his graduation, but the party bus culture had spun out of control. His intervention followed years of public debate, with objections from authorities as well as many of the school-leavers and their parents. \"We are worried about some negative trends in our schools and neighbourhoods, and within Norwegian youth culture in general,\" says Solveig Haukenes Aase, whose eldest child is graduating this year. Her two younger children are yet to start high school and she complains that the culture affects younger teenagers too: \"In recent years, it has also started to have an impact on middle school kids.\" Together with other parents she formed a group aimed at making the environment for young people safer. \"The attitude of school authorities previously was that it's a private matter, that therussecelebration is something that happens in your spare time,\" she told the BBC. \"But there has been a change in mentality among teachers, principals and school authorities, and it's now widely acknowledged that the newrusseculture has a huge impact on the school environment.\" Norway's minister of education, Kari Nessa Nordtun, said it had been \"a problem for many years that the celebrations and the exam period have been intertwined\". She told the BBC that school-leavers had experienced difficulties in concentrating on exams because of the partying and that results had declined because of it. \"The celebration has also become highly commercialised and exclusionary, and we see that these negative effects are spreading all the way down to lower secondary school. \"We want to put an end to social exclusion, peer pressure and high costs for many young people. We are now working to create a new and more inclusive graduation celebration.\" The plan now is to ensure that from next year celebrations are moved to the post-exam period. The party bus tradition dates back to Oslo in the early 1980s and tends to be more prevalent among some of the more elite schools. But it has now become national in scale and Ivar Brandvol, who has written about the tradition, believes the whole point of the bus has now changed, so that the bus celebrations no longer involve the whole school class but a more select group instead. \"Another change is the amount of money you need to be a part of a bus-group. Some of the bus-groups will have a budget up to 3m krone (£220,000) even if they choose to just rent it,\" he says. \"Sound-systems are shipped from all over Europe. To pay the bills, the groups will often sell toilet paper to friends, family and neighbours for a little profit. But the kids have to sell tons of toilet paper to earn enough, and usually end up using savings and getting into debt.\" There is a broad acceptance in Norway that the school-leavers' party bus culture has to be scaled back. The government is also worried about potential risks to teenagers' safety, as they dance on buses that are driven around during the night. \"We want this year's graduating class to be the last class that is allowed to use converted buses with sideways-facing seats and standing room while driving,\" says Jon-Ivar Nygard, Norway's Minister of Transport. \"We can no longer send our young people off in unsafe buses.\" For many prospective school-leavers in Norway the government's plan goes too far. \"The government wants to take away the sideways seating on the buses and just have group seating. I think it's the wrong way to go,\" complains Edvard Aanestad. And when it comes to addressing problems of inclusivity on the buses, he and his friend Henrik believe the authorities are taking the wrong approach. Only half of the 120 school-leavers in his year were part of a party-bus group, and they agree part of the reason was the high cost.

    "title": "North and South Korea are in an underground war - Kim Jong Un might now be winning",
    "article_text": "Listen to Jean read this article The border between North and South Korea is swamped with layers of dense barbed-wire fencing and hundreds of guard posts. But dotted among them is something even more unusual: giant, green camouflaged speakers. As I stood looking into the North one afternoon last month, one of the speakers began blasting South Korean pop songs interspersed with subversive messages. \"When we travel abroad, it energises us\", a woman's voice boomed out across the border - an obvious slight given North Koreans are not allowed to leave the country. From the North Korean side, I could faintly hear military propaganda music, as its regime attempted to drown out the inflammatory broadcasts. North and South Korea are technically still at war, and although it has been years since either side shelled the other, the two sides are fighting on a more subtle front: a war of information. The South tries to get information into the North, and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un tries furiously to block it, as he attempts to shield his people from outside information. North Korea is the only country in the world the internet has not penetrated. All TV channels, radio stations and newspapers are run by the state. \"The reason for this control is that so much of the mythology around the Kim family is made up. A lot of what they tell people is lies,\" says Martyn Williams, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Stimson Center, and an expert in North Korean technology and information. Expose those lies to enough people and the regime could come crumbling down, is how the thinking in South Korea goes. The loudspeakers are one tool used by the South Korean government, but behind the scenes a more sophisticated underground movement has flourished. A small number of broadcasters and non-profit organisations transmit information into the country in the dead of night on short and medium radio waves, so North Koreans can tune in to listen in secret. Thousands of USB sticks and micro-SD cards are also smuggled over the border every month loaded with foreign information - among them, South Korean films, TV dramas, and pop songs, as well as news, all designed to challenge North Korean propaganda. But now those working in the field fear that North Korea is gaining the upper hand. Not only is Kim cracking down hard on those caught with foreign content, but the future of this work could be in jeopardy. Much of it is funded by the US government, and has been hit by US President Donald Trump's recent aid cuts. So where does this leave both sides in their longstanding information war? Every month, a team at Unification Media Group (UMG), a South Korean non-profit organisation, sift through the latest news and entertainment offerings to put together playlists that they hope will resonate with those in the North. They then load them onto devices, which are categorised according to how risky they are to view. On low-risk USBs are South Korean TV dramas and pop songs - recently they included a Netflix romance series When Life Give You Tangerines, and a hit from popular South Korean singer and rapper Jennie. High-risk options include what the team calls \"education programmes\" – information to teach North Koreans about democracy and human rights, the content Kim is thought to fear the most. The drives are then sent to the Chinese border, where UMG's trusted partners carry them across the river into North Korea at huge risk. South Korean TV dramas may seem innocuous, but they reveal much about ordinary life there - people living in high-rise apartments, driving fast cars and eating at upmarket restaurants. It highlights both their freedom and how North Korea is many years behind. This challenges one of Kim's biggest fabrications: that those in the South are poor and miserably oppressed. \"Some [people] tell us they cried while watching these dramas, and that they made them think about their own dreams for the very first time\", says Lee Kwang-baek, director of UMG. It is difficult to know exactly how many people access the USBs, but testimonies from recent defectors seem to suggest the information is spreading and having an impact. \"Most recent North Korean defectors and refugees say it was foreign content that motivated them to risk their lives to escape\", says Sokeel Park, whose organisation Liberty in North Korea works to distribute this content. There is no political opposition or known dissidents in North Korea, and gathering to protest is too dangerous – but Mr Park hopes some will be inspired to carry out individual acts of resistance. Kang Gyuri, who is 24, grew up in North Korea, where she ran a fishing business. Then in late 2023, she fled to South Korea by boat. Watching foreign TV shows partly inspired her to go, she says. \"I felt so suffocated, and I suddenly had anurge to leave.\" When we met in a park on a sunny afternoon in Seoul last month, she reminisced about listening to radio broadcasts with her mum as a child. She got hold of her first K-drama when she was 10. Years later she learnt that USB sticks and SD cards were being smuggled into the country inside boxes of fruit. The more she watched, the more she realised the government was lying to her. \"I used to think it was normal that the state restricted us so much. I thought other countries lived with this control,\" she explains. \"But then I realised it was only in North Korea.\" Almost everyone she knew there watched South Korean TV shows and films. She and her friends would swap their USBs. \"We talked about the popular dramas and actors, and the K-pop idols we thought were good looking, like certain members of BTS. \"We'd also talk about how South Korea's economy was so developed; we just couldn't criticise the North Korean regime outright.\" The shows also influenced how she and her friends talked and dressed, she adds. \"North Korea's youth has changed rapidly.\" Kim Jong Un, all too aware of this risk to his regime, is fighting back. During the pandemic, he built new electric fences along the border with China, making it more difficult for information to be smuggled in. And new laws introduced from 2020 have increased the punishments for people who are caught consuming and sharing foreign media. One stated that those who distribute the content could be imprisoned or executed. This has had a chilling effect. \"This media used to be available to buy in markets, people would openly sell it, but now you can only get it from people you trust,\" says Mr Lee. After the crackdown began Ms Kang and her friends became more cautious too. \"We don't talk to each other about this anymore, unless we're really close, and even then we're much more secretive,\" she admits. She says she is aware of more young people being executed for being caught with South Korean content. Recently Kim has also cracked down on behaviour that could be associated with watching K-dramas. In 2023 he made it a crime for people to use South Korean phrases or speak in a South Korean accent. Members of 'youth crackdown squads', patrol the streets, tasked with monitoring young people's behaviour. Ms Kang recalls being stopped more often, before she escaped, and reprimanded for dressing and styling her hair like a South Korean. The squads would confiscate her phone and read her text messages, she adds, to make sure she had not used any South Korean terms. In late 2024, a North Korean mobile phone was smuggled out of the country by Daily NK, (Seoul-based media organisation UMG's news service). The phone had been programmed so that when a South Korean variant of a word is entered, it automatically vanishes, replaced with the North Korean equivalent - an Orwellian move. \"Smartphones are now part and parcel of the way North Korea tries to indoctrinate people\", says Mr Williams. Following all these crackdown measures, he believes North Korea is now \"starting to gain the upper hand\" in this information war. Following Donald Trump's return to the White House earlier this year, funds were severed to a number of of aid organisations, including some working to inform North Koreans. He also suspended funds to two federally financed news services, Radio Free Asia and Voice of America (VOA), which had been broadcasting nightly into North Korea. Trump accused VOA of being \"radical\" and anti-Trump\", while the White House said the move would \"ensure taxpayers are no longer on the hook for radical propaganda\". But Steve Herman, a former VOA bureau chief based in Seoul, argues: \"This was one of the very few windows into the world the North Korean people had, and it has gone silent with no explanation.\" UMG is still waiting to find out whether their funding will be permanently cut. Mr Park from Liberty in North Korea argues Trump has \"incidentally\" given Kim a helping hand, and calls the move \"short-sighted\". He argues that North Korea, with its expanding collection of nuclear weapons, poses a major security threat - and that given sanctions, diplomacy and military pressure have failed to convince Kim to denuclearise, information is the best remaining weapon. \"We're not just trying to contain the threat of North Korea, we're trying to solve it,\" he argues. \"To do that you need to change the nature of the country. \"If I was an American general I'd be saying 'how much does this stuff cost, and actually that's a pretty good use of our resources'\". The question that remains is, who should fund this work. Some question why it has fallen almost entirely to the US. One solution could be for South Korea to foot the bill - but the issue of North Korea is heavily politicised here. The liberal opposition party tends to try to improve relations with Pyongyang, meaning funding information warfare is a no go. The party's frontrunner in next week's presidential election has already indicated he would turn off the loudspeakers if elected. Yet Mr Park remains hopeful. \"The good thing is that the North Korean government can't go into people's heads and take out the information that's been building for years,\" he points out. And as technologies develop, he is confident that spreading information will get easier. \"In the long run I really believe this is going to be the thing that changes North Korea\".

    "title": "The noise battle at the heart of Real Madrid's stadium",
    "article_text": "Last year, tens of thousands of 'Swifties' - Taylor Swift fans - thronged Madrid to watch back-to-back concerts at the Spanish capital's famous Bernabéu stadium, home to Real Madrid, who won Europe's Champions League final less than 24 hours later, on 1 June. The mega-concert was one of dozens of high-profile gigs staged at the newly renovated stadium in 2024 to boost the club's revenue. But the project was short lived. In September all gigs were cancelled after residents living within earshot of the music filed a legal complaint over the noise. Now, nine months later, Spanish pop singer Aitana is the latest artist to switch venues from the Bernabéu to the Metropolitano Stadium – home to rivals Atletico Madrid – as the court case rumbles on. \"In every concert it is exactly the same,\" says Enrique Martínez de Azagra, president of the neighbours' association. He and other locals say the sound from concerts like Taylor Swift's has become too much. \"It is impossible to suffer this kind of noise and it affects our health, it affects migraines, insomnia and heart attacks and it is a criminal offence in our laws,\" adds Enrique. In Madrid, the noise levels measured by the neighbours exceeded 90 decibels regularly during the concerts. Ian Marnane from the European Environment Agency says that in Europe any level of 55 decibels or above is considered to be harmful, and continued exposure can lead to increased blood pressure and cardiovascular disease such as strokes. There are also links between noise exposure and diabetes. Enrique says there is a significant difference between the noise from the concerts compared with that from football matches. He and most of his neighbours have lived in the area for decades. Many of them are life-long Real Madrid supporters and are on committees that represent the interests of the club. \"Football is a sport that lasts two hours, more or less. The noise is normal. Only when there is a goal, the passion surges,\" says Enrique. The problem he sees with the concerts is that they spew continuously high levels of noise for long periods of hours at a time. To reduce their exposure to these high levels of noise, Enrique and his neighbours took Real Madrid to court. Sports journalist Felippo Maria Ricci believes they have a strong case. \"The Bernabéu is right in the heart of Madrid. The neighbours who live there have good positions and know the right people,\" says Felippo. \"This battle for the concerts can be quite long but at the moment Real Madrid is losing this battle.\" The neighbours say the city government is hesitant to resolve the issue as it benefits from the tourism and the money the concerts generate. According to local media reports, tourists coming for the Taylor Swift concerts alone spent about €25m (£21m; $28m). Filippo says that the £1.1bn renovation to make the stadium multi-purpose was supposed to provide a huge financial boost to Real Madrid. They also signed a contract with a US company selling the commercial rights to the stadium. \"They spent a lot of money to develop a new system for the pitch, to take it off when they have the concerts,\" says Filippo. \"Now all this new super system is quite useless, at the moment, all that money is gone.\" Ed Sheeran, Imagine Dragons and AC/DC are among the acts playing at the rival Atlético stadium this summer. Madrid City Council, the Mayor's office and Real Madrid have not responded to requests for comment by the BBC. Real Madrid has previously said it is trying to sound proof the stadium. According to local reports the club hired a specialist company and windows were installed in the skywalk area. When I put to the neighbours that Real Madrid is trying to soundproof the stadium, they chuckled. Enrique works as an engineer and thinks it is \"quite impossible to soundproof the stadium\". While the Bernabéu's roof can close, the stadium is never completely closed, as there is an open gap between the roof and the facade all the way around the stadium. The neighbours say they are not against all concerts. \"We've had concerts in the past, but once a year,\" says Pablo Baschwitz, a lawyer and one of the neighbours campaigning for change. He recalls concerts with music legends such as Frank Sinatra and Julio Iglesias at the Bernabéu - but says having 20 concerts scheduled per year is just too much. From the roof terrace of one of the neighbours' flats the proximity to the stadium is plain to see. They point to a health centre that they say struggles to accurately measure patients' blood pressure at times because the sound waves from the concerts disturb the readings in their machines. Pablo says the concerts aren't the only problem – there are also rehearsals and sound checks during the day which disturb the local community, including schools. Luis Jordana de Pozas lives right across from the stadium, and some of the noise measurements were taken on the outside and inside of his flat. On his terrace overlooking the Bernabéu, he explains how newly added metal plates on the stadium's exterior have amplified the sound, and shows me recorded videos of the \"unbearable\" noise. In Madrid, the facades of the houses around the stadium are lined with banners. Draped from their windows, balconies and terraces the neighbours put their protest posters on display, reading \"conciertos no\" (no concerts) and \"ruído no\" (no noise). For now, while the case is in court, the music has stopped. The killing in a Madrid suburb has shocked Ukrainians, but has not triggered an outpouring of grief. Copper thieves halt services from Madrid to the southern region of Andalusia. Drivers in Guernsey with excessively noisy vehicles will in future be penalised under a new law. A man incurs thousands of pounds in court costs after losing an appeal over a noise abatement order. Governments are trying to work out what caused the outages in Spain and Portugal.",

    "title": "The police job that is beyond the stuff of nightmares",
    "article_text": "David Murray's office has a warning on its door: \"Please be aware: child sexual abuse material being viewed in this room.\" The detective constable spends hours examining pictures and watching videos, the worst of which are beyond the stuff of nightmares. He puts himself through it because he knows the job is important. The father of two young boys admits it takes its toll, yet he wishes he had started the job far earlier in his policing career to make a difference. He says it's worth it, because every week he and his colleagues are identifying young victims, and protecting them from further abuse. Earlier this week,Police Scotland invited BBC Scotland News to witness its workdemonstrating the change in offending behaviour since the Covid pandemic, revealing that paedophiles were making direct contact with children online within 30 seconds of trying. David was the first victim identification officer to work with Police Scotland's national child abuse investigation unit. After four years, he now has three colleagues and an ever increasing workload. The unit is conducting 700 inquiries a year and executing 15 to 20 search warrants every week, seizing dozens of devices from the homes of suspects. The job of the victim identification officers is to examine images and footage found on these phones and laptops, to try to find children who've been abused. According to Interpol, online child sexual abuse is one of the rare crime areas where police officers start with the evidence and work their way back to the crime scene. Once images are found, the victim identification specialists take over, combing through the images with the objective of removing the child from harm and arresting the abuser. But their workload is increasing as fast as they can get through them. David says: \"Four years ago we were identifying approximately 25 to 30 victims a year. We're doing more than ten times that now.\" Shockingly, the victims are close to home. \"Last year we identified nearly 400 victims and 90% of those children are from Scotland. \"When I started, I thought it was a problem that was far away, but it's on our doorstep. It's children in our community.\" The contents of the devices are uploaded to the UK-wide child abuse image database. If they've been discovered before, they don't have to be viewed again, but if they're new, they're classed as \"first generation\" images and checked by David and his colleagues. The grim reality of that is that much of the abuse takes place within households where the perpetrator knows the victim. That means devices can include pictures of normal family life, providing a horrifying contrast to the images of abuse and vital information for the detectives. \"Essentially we start looking for clues in the pictures as to where this footage was taken, things like plug sockets or bits of clothing, maybe school uniforms and football strips, anything that would perhaps indicate where the child lives,\" says David. \"A lot of our identifications are made from non-indecent images.\" One victim was recently traced in Glasgow after a detective recognised a water tower in the background of a selfie. Steps are taken to safeguard children who've been identified, in conjunction with outside agencies such as social work. The most extreme images and videos viewed by David and his colleagues plumb the depths of depravity.  He agrees they have to switch off their own emotions. Police Scotland monitors the wellbeing of officers in this type of work and there are strict rules to limit how much time they spend looking at the material. They're not allowed to view it in the first or last hour of their shift, and one day a week is spent working from home, catching up on admin and emails. \"It's just a case of prioritising and laying out your day,\" David says. \"We start with a briefing every morning and we've got quite a substantial workload, and we just work our way through it the best we can. \"There are wellbeing measures in place and talking to counsellors and other people about what you're feeling and seeing can help unlock things.\" Every week he and his colleagues walk past that warning on their office doors. \"We are reviewing footage of something that's already happened to these children,\" says David. \"But when we identify them and put the safeguarding measures in place, that's the most satisfying part of the job. \"I used to work in other areas of policing, like serious and organised crime and drug enforcement but I can honestly say that now kind of pales into insignificance. \"It doesn't compare to putting measures in place to make a child safe.\" Keith Warhurst is also accused of sending indecent images to a WhatsApp chat and making derogatory comments about a pregnant woman. When it was rescued in 2008 Royal Bank of Scotland had more than $2.2 (£1.63) trillion on its balance sheet.

    "title": "Why are disposable vapes being banned and how harmful is vaping?",
    "article_text": "From Sunday, it will be illegal for businesses to sell or supply disposable vapes. The government hopes the ban will reduce environmental damage caused by the devices and help cut the number of children and young people vaping. Disposable vapes ban From1 June 2025, businesses will bebanned from selling or supplying any single-use vapes, whether that's in shops or online. Retailers caught breaking the law in England face a minimum £200 fine, with a prison sentence of up to two years for repeat offences. Penalties are broadly similar in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Trading Standards will be able to seize any single-use vapes they find. Only devices considered to be reusable will be legal. That means that they must have a rechargeable battery, a replaceable coil, and be refillable. It won't be illegal to own a disposable vape after 1 June. Customers can still return them, and retailers have an obligation to get rid of them. Vaping tax Vaping products are already subject to 20% VAT but, unlike tobacco, they do not currently attract a separate additional tax. A new vaping duty will start on1 October 2026. It will be charged at a flat rate of £2.20 per 10ml vaping liquid. At the same time, tobacco duty will be increased to preserve the financial incentive for cigarette smokers to switch to vaping. Advertising and sponsorship ban The government's Tobacco and Vapes Bill - which is currently making its way through Parliament - will outlaw vape advertising and sponsorship. It will also restrict the flavours, packaging and display of vapes and other nicotine products. Children have beentargeted with colours, branding and flavours such as bubble gum or candy floss, to push a product that can lead to nicotine addiction, the British Medical Association has warned. Illegal vapes The government is also cracking down on iIlegal vapes, which are widely available and are much more likely to contain other harmful chemicals or drugs. More than six million illegal vaping products were seized by Trading Standards officers across England between 2022 and 2024, according to analysis by the BBC. The ban on disposable vapes was introduced to tackle their impact on the environment. Almost five million single-use vapes were thrown away each week in 2023, according to the Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs (Defra). As well as lithium-ion batteries, vapes also contain circuit boards. If these aren't not disposed of properly, they can leak toxic compounds such as cobalt and copper. That means fish, and marine mammals could mistake vapes for food and ingest poisonous chemicals. The Local Government Association (LGA), also says that single-use vapes are \"a hazard for waste and litter collection and causefires in bin lorries\". However, recycling disposable vapes is not straightforward because of their size and the way they are manufactured, which makes them difficult to take apart. These minerals and the lithium could - if recovered - be reused for green technologies such as electric car batteries or in wind turbines. There is currently no large-scale disposable vape recycling in the UK. There are so many different types of vape on the market that it is difficult to develop a standard recycling process. Around 18% of 11 to 17-year-olds (980,000 children)have tried vaping, according to a 2024 survey by health charity ASH (Action on Smoking and Health). About 7% (390,000 children) said they currently vaped, down from 8% in 2023, but still well above the 4% figure recorded in 2020. In contrast, just over 5% of 11 to 17-year-olds (280,000 children) said they currently smoked, while just under 3% (150,000 children) said they both smoked and vaped. Among all age groups over 16, the use of vapes has risen, with about 5.1 million people using a vape or e-cigarette in 2023. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) says 5.9% of people aged 16 and over vaped every day, up slightly from the previous year, while another 3.9% did so occasionally. The group with the highest rate of vape use - nearly 16% - was 16-24 year-olds. Vaping is nowhere near as harmful as smoking cigarettes, which contain tobacco, tar and a range of other toxic cancer-causing chemicals, and is one of the largest preventable causes of illness and death in the UK. But because vaping may itself cause long-term damage to lungs, hearts and brains, it is only recommended for adult smokers trying to quit as part of the NHS \"swap to stop\" programme. The vapour inhaled contains a small amount of chemicals, often including the addictive substance nicotine. \"Vapes can be an effective way for adult smokers to quit - but we have always been clear that children and adult non-smokers should never vape,\" the Department of Health and Social Care has said. More research is needed to fully understand the effects of vaping, but in December 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned \"alarming evidence\" was growing about the damage it causes. In February 2025, the government said a £62m research project would track 100,000 eight to 18-year-olds for a decade to better understand the risks. An international study found immunotherapy before surgery could give patients extra years of life. Etienne-Emile Baulieu created the pill to give women a safe alternative to surgical abortion. From Sunday, single-use disposable vapes will be banned in Wales - but what do people think of it? They warn some reusable vapes have \"identical\" packaging to single-use ones and are sold at the same price. Single-use vapes will be banned in Wales from 1 June amid part of health and environmental concerns.",

    "title": "Are you not entertained? 'Vintage England' deliver under pressure",
    "article_text": "Aggie Beever-Jones scored a 33-minute hat-trick for England All eyes were on goalkeeper Hannah Hampton after a rocky week for the England squad - but just half an hour in, it was someone else taking the spotlight at Wembley. Chelsea forward Aggie Beever-Jones was star of the show, scoring her first England hat-trick in the6-0 thumping of Portugalin the Women's Nations League. The 21-year-old's treble came in just 33 minutes. It was a scintillating performance from Beever-Jones and the Lionesses just five weeks out from Euro 2025 when they will attempt to defend their European title. Noise had been building pre-match following goalkeeperMary Earps' shock international retirement.How would they cope without one of their talismanic leaders? Could Chelsea's Hampton handle the pressure? Clearly, they coped extremely well, and newly confirmed number one Hampton barely had to move a muscle. \"Are you not entertained?,\" said former England goalkeeper Karen Bardsley on BBC Radio 5 Live. \"I'm running out of rubber on my eraser because I keep having to change [goalscoring] tally marks. \"It's been so fun to watch, with so much fluidity, and the enjoyment this England team has been playing with.\" Ex-England defender Lindsay Johnson described it as a \"Friday night funfest\" and even manager Sarina Wiegman celebrated more than usual in the dugout. With so much attention on matters off the pitch over the past week, this was a performance that emphatically shut out the noise and lifted the mood. It was \"back to business\" as Wiegman claimed afterwards. England and Spain set for shootout - how it stands in Nations League Beever-Jones stars as England thrash Portugal in Nations League Earps retires - where does that leave England? She had fielded questions regarding Earps' retirement on Thursday, admitting it had been a \"hard\" start to the week. Wiegman was visibly emotional, reflecting on the good times they shared together and unwilling to discuss how frustrating the sudden departure of the 32-year-old may be. With only 13 caps for Hampton prior to kick-off, and none for the other two goalkeepers in the squad, fears were raised about their inexperience. But when the team in front plays so well, it quickly becomes less of a concern. Hampton spent the majority of the second half stood still, watching on as her team-mates tried to add to their five first-half goals, managing one more through Chloe Kelly. Hat-trick hero Beever-Jones gave some insight into Wiegman's talk before the Group A3 tie: \"She said before the game, 'it's a new kit, it's a new England, we have a new squad'.\" But it wasn't a new England, it was a \"vintage\" England, according to Bardsley, who was waxing lyrical by the time the fifth goal came in only the 33rd minute, sealing a treble for Beever-Jones. Lucy Bronze nodded in England's second, while Beth Mead joined in on the action and substitute Kelly added the finishing touch with the sixth in the 62nd minute. \"This is reminding me of vintage England, casting myself back to 2022,\" said Bardsley, who made 81 appearances for the Lionesses. \"Portugal have been poor, but among the noise, it is so wonderful to see the girls with smiles on their faces.\" They were not the only ones with smiles on their faces as supporters danced and celebrated at full-time, clearly encouraged by what they had witnessed. England's form has dipped throughout the last 18 months. Just seven weeks ago they were beaten in Leuven by Belgium - who are bottom of the Women's Nations League group - and two months after picking up a victory over world champions Spain at Wembley. But the Lionesses showed they were up to the task when the pressure was on, buoyed by the return of key players Georgia Stanway, Lauren Hemp and Alex Greenwood from injury. \"There has been a lot of noise [this week] and players wanted to put that to bed,\" added Johnson. \"Questions in the press conference were relentless and they are going to be. They just want to talk about football and they made it all about the football. \"Mary [Earps] will be missed, but when you score six goals in the fashion they did, we are just talking about the football and how good England were.\" Aggie Beever-Jones is only the second female footballer to score an international hat-trick for England at Wembley, after Beth Mead \"Aggie Beever-Jones is a baller,\" was also Bardsley's statement at full-time as she lauded the matchwinner. The Chelsea forward has given her chances of selection for Euro 2025 a significant boost and Wiegman couldn't help but laugh when asked the question. \"I think she did really wellâ¦\" said the Dutchwoman with a smile. \"She is a goalscorer. She scores goals very easily and very well. She has such quick feet. She is also really tight on the ball, she played really relaxed.\" Team-mate Kelly said it was great to see Beever-Jones \"firing\" in an England shirt and Bardsley said she was a \"pesky\" forward to play against. Competition for a starting role will be hard to come by though. Arsenal's Alessia Russo was watching from the bench, rested for this match after picking up a minor calf injury, while Chelsea's Lauren James has still to return from injury. Hemp was impressive too on her first England game since knee surgery in November, while Mead was on the scoresheet and Kelly proved her worth off the bench. \"She really announced herself and put her case forward to Sarina Wiegman so she knows she is capable of starting at the Euros this summer,\" added Bardsley of Beever-Jones. \"Knowing there's that weapon, whether it's on the bench or from the start, is so lovely to know that she's in Sarina Wiegman's tool kit.\" Beever-Jones looked over to her family to celebrate and revealed the team had signed the match ball to take home afterwards. But whatever her role is at the Euros, she is ready to make an impact. \"In football it's never just a straight line. I've had to be patient in this set-up and that just shows the quality the team has,\" Beever-Jones told BBC Radio 5 Live. \"I got the opportunity and I am grateful to everyone who helped me get into this place. I couldn't have hoped for a better day. \"I wouldn't want anyone else for competition. Alessia [Russo] is an incredible player, I learn so much off her and the whole frontline. Hopefully I can contribute where I can. \"Whenever I'm playing for England I just hope I'm giving the right people the right headaches.\" Head here to get involved Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "'A footballing architect' - how Enrique led PSG to brink of glory",
    "article_text": "PSG head coach Luis Enrique is aiming to win the Champions League for the second time as a manager Paris St-Germain's journey to the brink of glory in the Champions League final started when the final giant symbol of the club's so-called \"bling bling\" era was swept away. Kylian Mbappe's decision to join Real Madrid last summer saw the only remaining member of the superstar attacking trio, which included Neymar and Lionel Messi, leave Paris, clearing the way for PSG's switch of strategy under coach Luis Enrique. Enrique, described by those within PSG as \"a footballing architect\", seized his chance, convincing club president Nasser al-Khelaifi and football advisor Luis Campos that he could build a younger, better, more cohesive side in the post-Mbappe age. And so it has proved, as now only a formidable Inter Milan team stand between this thrilling young PSG side and the crown they crave most, the Champions League. PSG, fuelled by brilliant young talents such as 19-year-old Desire Doue and Georgian genius Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, and inspired by Enrique, who has known such tragedy and triumph in his life, have become a genuine Champions League feel-good story on the pitch. Can they now provide a happy ending? Champions League winners? Best moment? Star player? Pundits' picks Pick your combined PSG and Inter Milan XI 'The league of farmers?' How PSG and Inter defied the odds Desire Doue has been one of PSG's star performers in the Champions League Luis Enrique walks barefoot on the grass of Campus PSG, the club's training ground 25 minutes away from their Parc des Princes home, every morning as part of his devotion to \"earthing\", believing it brings him closer to nature and helps fight off allergies. If the 55-year-old Asturian can bring the Champions League to Paris for the first time, PSG's fanatical ultras will be believe he can also walk on water. Enrique's appointment in July 2023 was a clear signal that PSG were moving away from the superstar culture, a dramatic change of direction which appealed to a coach bolted on to the team ethic. French football expert Julien Laurens told BBC Sport: \"They wanted someone to build something for the future, with patience. He was the best candidate. \"The considered people of the calibre of Antonio Conte and Jose Mourinho. These guys are winners but they win now. They don't really build anything. Luis Enrique fitted what PSG wanted.\" Former Brazil midfielder Rai, who was a member of the only PSG team to win a European trophy in the Cup Winners' Cup in 1996, is also an Enrique admirer. He told BBC Sport: \"Nowadays, for a team to be considered complete and with a good chance of winning major titles, they need not only talent, but 100% commitment from all players, at all times of the game, whether defending or attacking, with or without the ball. \"What is most impressive about Luis Enrique's management is the fact that he achieved this in such a short time, and especially with such young players. This shows that his tactical scheme was well understood, that the players believe in him, and that his system is very effective.\" Away from the pitch, the coach also demanded a level of control that had escaped predecessors such as Unai Emery, Thomas Tuchel, Mauricio Pochettino and Christophe Galtier. \"Luis Enrique is the leader of the club,\" said Laurens. \"For a long time it was run by the superstars. If they didn't want to do something they wouldn't do it. They would go straight to the president. It undermined the coach - not any more.\" Mauricio Pochettino, pictured with Kylian Mbappe, was one of several coaches who struggled to impose his will on PSG's superstar-filled dressing room Enrique's authority is absolute when it comes to playing matters at PSG. Pierre-Etienne Minonzio, based in Paris with influential sports paper L'Equipe, told BBC Sport: \"People at PSG understood there had been a problem of authority in the last few years. \"Galtier was a French manager, and a good one, but lacked the experience to impose his views. He was a very good manager, but not strong enough to face Mbappe and say things to him. \"It was the same with Mauricio Pochettino. It was always said his obsession was to have peace in the dressing room. He never took any decisions that went against Messi and Mbappe, \"Enrique was not having that. He told PSG clearly 'If I am the boss and I will be the boss'. He's now the guy who embodies the whole club, the whole team.\" Enrique is obsessive about PSG and his own self-discipline down to the finest details, with his watch even alerting him if he has not carried out any stretching or movement for 30 minutes. In 2007, he successfully took on the Frankfurt Ironman challenge - a 2.4-mile swim, a 118-mile cycle and a full marathon. In 2008, he ran the gruelling Marathon de Sables, a 155-mile race staged over six days in the Sahara desert. He is, however, someone with true perspective after losing his nine-year-old daughter Xana to a rare form of bone cancer in 2019. Enrique has said: \"Her body is gone, but she hasn't died. She's still with us. \"Physically, she may not be here, but spiritually she is. Because every day we talk about her, we laugh, and we remember because I think Xana still sees us.\" It enables him to reflect on the realities of football, once saying: \"I'm not afraid of the worst in football If they sack me, no problem. The next day, I'll go for a cycling trip.\" Should Enrique win his second Champions League, following a triumph with Barcelona in 2015, it will be a moment of history and high emotion in Munich. Mbappe's departure was PSG's clear the air moment. The French superstar may have added goals and a touch of genius, but the landscape shifted at Parc des Princes once he left. Enrique saw it as the opportunity to exert complete control on how PSG played, with brilliant, but ultimately individualistic, Mbappe gone. This control was over a new \"team\" - in the literal sense of the word - with Enrique focusing on young talent he could mould rather than established, often ego-driven, figures. Enrique believed it might take more than this season to challenge for the biggest prize, namely the Champions League, and a slow start to the campaign backed this view. He may regard reaching the Champions League final as being ahead of schedule. PSG's new era truly began when Premier League champions Manchester City were thrashed 4-2 on a rain-lashed night in Paris and the new brigade like Doue and Bradley Barcola came to prominence. Ousmane Dembele, restored from his Barcelona struggles, delivered a stunning cameo as substitute. And so it went on, as this trio helped PSG take a wrecking ball to the Premier League's elite, Liverpool, Aston Villa and then Arsenal beaten in the knockout stage to reach Munich. To add to their growing power, Kvaratskhelia arrived from Napoli in January for 70m euros (Â£59m) plus add-ons to complete the jigsaw. Former Scotland winger and BBC Sport pundit Pat Nevin is a long-time Kvaratskhelia fan saying: \"He has got everything I want from a winger, but a bit more as well. \"He always wants to take players on. He wants to attack players. He has lots of tricks and flicks. He does unusual things and he breaks lines. Never ever fearful, always positive and wants to entertain. \"You need two people to mark him. If he doesn't go by players, he draws players towards him, and then he slips others in because he has developed the space.\" Teenager Desire Doue is a shining symbol of PSG's new strategy of signing young stars with potential to grow Doue had a slow start but, along with Barcola and Dembele, was the beneficiary of Enrique's one-on-one attention, the coach utterly invested in the young talent that would decorate his new team. Rai said: \"What impresses me most about them [PSG's young forwards] is that they combine technical quality, tactical obedience and physical intensity with personality. All of them have an impressive ability to dribble and improvise.\" And there is no preferential treatment. All are equal in Enrique's eyes. Dembele was dropped before the Champions League game at Arsenal in October after Enrique expressed dissatisfaction with his work-rate in a Ligue 1 game against Rennes. Dembele returned transformed and freshly motivated, leading PSG's run to the Ligue 1 title, the Coupe de France - and now with the Champions League in their sights. Measured by average age, PSG are the youngest side to have progressed beyond the play-off round in the Champions League this season at 24 years 262 days. And their intense, high-pressing style is illustrated by the fact they rank first in the tournament this season for shot-ending high turnovers (37). They frequently turn high-presses into attacking opportunities. This will be a final of youth against experience, with the average age of Inter Milan's starting 11 in the Champions League this season 30 years and 19 days - the oldest among all 36 teams involved in the tournament. PSG will hope Enqrique's potent blend of youthful brilliance and more experienced figures such as captain Marquinhos and goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, who has had a superb Champions League campaign, will finally bring trophy back to Paris. The famous Virage Auteuil, where PSG's ultras gather at one end of Parc des Princes, will be transported to Munich for one night only for this final. To watch PSG cut a swathe through the Premier League's best on the way to Munich was to witness the dial of expectation turned up with every game in a kaleidoscope of colour and a wall of sound. PSG's followers were denied the chance to attend the club's only previous Champions League final, when they lost 1-0 behind closed doors to Bayern Munich at Lisbon's Stadium Of Light during the Covid pandemic. So a special welcome will await PSG's players of the sort that has become familiar at Parc des Princes. PSG's famous \"Ultras\" will be out in force in Munich for the Champions League Final against Inter Milan \"Beaten By The Waves, Paris Never Sunk\" read the tifo stretching along one end of Virage Auteuil before they beat Manchester City, while \"55 years of memory behind you to write history\" was the message before Arsenal were beaten in the semi-final second leg in Paris. There will, no doubt, be fresh motivational messages for PSG's players on Saturday night. In the previous 10 seasons, PSG have reached two semi-finals, two quarter-finals, the last 16 five times, and that one final under Tuchel. PSG's colourful fans have been flooding into Munich for the biggest night in their history, anticipation heavy in the air that Luis Enrique's emerging side can at last cross that elusive final frontier.

    "title": "Embarrassing defeat and bizarre parade - inside Man Utd's troubled trip",
    "article_text": "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim speaks to the media after his side's 3-1 win over Hong Kong \"As a player, and I have been there, they probably need this like a hole in the head.\" Hong Kong coach Ashley Westwood was blunt and to the point when speaking about Manchester United's post-season tour of Asia. As an FA Youth Cup winner with United in 1995 - and someone who worked for the club's in-house television channel MUTV during a recent pre-season trip to Perth - Westwood has an understanding of the pressures and demands associated with being a player for the 20-time English champions. While publicly United's players talked up their post-season trip to Asia and privately officials have praised the way they carried out a mountain of commercial demands, Westwood said no-one should be in any doubt about the reality of the situation. \"No-one says it on the record because they can't, but fans and sponsors pay wages and this trip is all about revenues,\" he said. At half-time in Hong Kong, as United trailed 1-0 to the national side 153rd in Fifa's rankings, the tour looked to be going from bad to worse. Two youngsters signed from Arsenal this season - striker Chido Obi and defender Ayden Heaven - scored the second-half goals that brought a below-capacity crowd at a rain-soaked Hong Kong stadium to life - and at least allowed United to head into the summer on a winning note. Whether the trip itself was a success is another matter. Manchester United forward Alejandro Garnacho arrives at the Bukit Jalil stadium in Kuala Lumpur in sunglasses United estimate they will generate about Â£10m from their 14,000-mile, six-day expedition. The payment is not connected to ticket sales, so it is guaranteed. At a time when their focus in pre-season - both commercially and from a player preparation perspective - is on the United States, where they will go for the third successive summer in July, United's presence in the region also allows them to 'service' existing big-money sponsorship deals with the likes of banking partner Maybank, airline partner Malaysia Airlines, beer partner Tiger and tyre partner Apollo. If evidence was needed for the real purpose of United's trip, it came from the knowledge goalkeeper Andre Onana and defenders Harry Maguire and Diogo Dalot had been substituted and were heading for the airport as their team-mates were being booed by a large percentage of a 72,550 crowd following their surprise 1-0 defeat by a South-East Asia select XI on Wednesday. The trio were boarding a private plane to Mumbai, where they would spend Thursday on a packed commercial programme arranged by Apollo, before getting home a day earlier than those who had gone to Hong Kong for the second game. As Westwood said, United's players had been given little choice about being on the trip. Departure immediately after the final Premier League game of the season against Aston Villa meant there was no opportunity to back out. Dutch defender Matthijs de Ligt was present, even though he was not fit enough to play. United wanted Christian Eriksen and Victor Lindelof there too but both had personal reasons to decline. So Ruben Amorim's squad opted to make the best of it. Unlike a focused and driven pre-season tour, it is fair to say their approach to this event was 'relaxed'. The scenes on the flight from Manchester to Kuala Lumpur were said to be like a party, with loud music and drinks. Some players and staff members were seen at a club on Monday, immediately after their arrival. There was also a chance to wind down after Wednesday's game. In the wake of their defeat in Kuala Lumpur, there was gallows humour among the squad when it was pointed out somewhat ironically that after the season they just had domestically, they had now managed to get booed by fans 6,600 miles away from home. Dutch striker Joshua Zirkzee nipped out - accompanied by security - to get some late-night food because room service was not to his taste. Amad Diallo, Heaven and Alejandro Garnacho tried to take an e-scooter ride, only to discover they did not have the money to pay for it. Garnacho does not appear to have been an enthusiastic participant. Told following Amorim's return from a post-Europa League final summit with Sir Jim Ratcliffe and other club executives in Monaco he could find a new club in the summer, the young Argentina winger remains popular among supporters, as evidenced by the raucous cheers for him in both matches. Yet there is evidence of a lack of engagement. After the ASEAN All-Stars defeat, Garnacho went straight past opposition captain Sergio Aguero - a 31-year-old Argentina-born naturalised Malaysian - despite promising him his shirt from the game. The damage was rectified by a United kitman, who grabbed Garnacho's shirt from the dressing room and handed it over. Thursday brought more negativity as pictures emerged on social media of Amadmaking a one-fingered gestureto a fan as he was leaving the team hotel. Amad subsequently said he was responding to abuse against his mum. He accepted his reaction was wrong but at the same time did not regret it. If specific behaviours raise an eyebrow or can be excused, from a corporate perspective, some of United's decisions have also been dubious. The context is clearly different but having ruled out having a parade if they won the Europa League final in Bilbao, to see a group of players - including Zirkzee - embark on a bus parade through Kuala Lumpur was bizarre. Some fans did turn out - and there remains enthusiasm for United in this region. But it is not on remotely the same levels as their last visit to Malaysia, in 2009, when they were Premier League champions, and had the likes of Ryan Giggs, Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney in their squad. At that time, they struggled to get around their hotel such was the constant presence of fans. Their first game attracted a crowd of 85,000 - and there were 30,000 at a second, arranged at 48 hours' notice after a terrorist attack in Jakarta, where they were supposed to be going. Nani was on that tour too and the Portuguese winger was part of a three-man team of 'legends' along with Wes Brown and John O'Shea who have been on this trip to push the club narrative. 'Why support a team that loses?' - how fans in Asia moved on from Man Utd Fernandes considers quitting Man Utd for Al-Hilal This video can not be played Amorim confident Fernandes wants to stay at Man Utd For Amorim, it has been another eye-opening crash course in what being a figurehead at United means. \"More than a manager\" was his assessment in Hong Kong on Thursday night. He was introduced to Anwar Ibrahim - the Malaysian prime minister, and a United fan - during his time in Kuala Lumpur. It is the kind of exposure you do not get at most clubs, even the size of his previous team Sporting in Portugal. Amorim knows, stripped away from the sideshow, he must deliver results. Somehow in Malaysia, after a season in which he described his team as \"probably the worst\" United have ever had, his side managed to lose against a team made up of players from a region with no history of making an impact on the global stage. United were booed off, Amorim claimed his side were \"chokers\" and he had to implore supporters to buy tickets for the Hong Kong game. It was a plea that went unheeded judging by the numbers of empty seats. The squad arrived in Hong Kong to a huge thunderstorm and a deluge that raised concerns the final match of the trip might not take place. The game went ahead, although it did so amid fresh speculation overthe future of skipper Bruno Fernandes, who has been the subject of a huge offer from Saudi club Al-Hilal, who want the Portugal midfielder to be part of their squad at the Club World Cup. Amorim believes Fernandes will stay, but until the 30-year-old or Al Hilal specifically state otherwise, nothing is certain. Eventual victory against Hong Kong was well received by the most of those there to witness it. But Amorim accepts the trip was missing something pretty important. Between June and August 2011, market research company Kantar conducted a poll of \"nearly 54,000 adults in 39 countries\" and concluded United had 659 million global \"followers\". In this period of brutal cost-cutting, it seems doubtful Ratcliffe will be commissioning an update any time soon. On theevidence here in Hong Kong and Malaysia, it is hard to imagine United have close to that number now. Where once they dominated the Premier League commercially, now they trail Manchester City, who have generated greater prize money over the past decade. United are not the draw they once were, despite the red shirts on show this week, which, in fairness to Fernandes, Garnacho and others, they spent time signing for fans before leaving for Hong Kong airport and home. It is not known when they will return to the region - but Amorim knows for certain what would make it a better experience than this one. \"We want to return but I would like to come back with better results,\" he said. \"The people are really lovely and respectful and we are grateful for everybody. But it would be so much fun to come here with titles.\" Latest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views Get Man Utd news notifications Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "'Relief' and 'pride' as Jones takes her chance",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played 'What a relief that must be' - Jones makes first career ODI century Amy Jones had waited a while for her first international century - 12 years, 225 matches and 190 innings, to be exact. Against a struggling West Indies at Derby, in England's first one-day international under the new leadership regime of Nat Sciver-Brunt and Charlotte Edwards, the wicketkeeper finally made it out of the 90s. Edwards' first tactical move in the 50-over format was to promote Jones back up the order after Maia Bouchier's omission from the side, and she repaid the faith immediately. Jones had opened for England 23 times previously between 2016 and 2019, but said the simplicity of Edwards' approach helped take the pressure off upon her return to the top. \"She said, 'you've scored big runs at county level opening and you did pretty well opening before so have a good go at it'. For it to be an option was really exciting for me,\" Jones told BBC Test Match Special. \"It feels really special [to make the century]. It feels like it has been a long time, especially with a bit of an opportunity to bat at the top of the order at the start of my career, so it just feels like a lot of relief and a huge amount of pride.\" New mum Sciver-Brunt was set to miss Windies series Beaumont and Jones tons set up crushing England win West Indies women in England 2025 The Ashes drubbing which started the year was one to forget for all of England's players, but Jones suffered a particularly painful experience in the second ODI at Melbourne which really kickstarted England's spiral. Tasked withchasing 181 to level the series, Jones was left unbeaten on 47 having failed to marshal the tail and miscounting the balls left in an over. Since that series, Edwards had made her intentions clear regarding England's \"smartness\" in 50-over cricket so it is fitting that Jones has immediately answered the call. Jones had made it past 90 three times in an England shirt before, making 94 against India in 2018, 91 v West Indies in 2019 and an unbeaten 92 against New Zealand in 2024 - and the nerves did seem to be kicking in when she was dropped on 92 and 93 in this knock. Tougher opposition will certainly come - in fact, rather soon, with India's arrival next month, but the smile on Jones' face as she embraced fellow centurion Tammy Beaumont in celebration indicated the sheer weight lifted from her shoulders. \"There would have been a few people scratching their heads on why she would be opening the batting,\" said former England seamer Katherine Sciver-Brunt on BBC Test Match Special. \"I never thought she lost that spot, so I am massively pleased. She didn't say to whoever was in charge, 'I want that spot back', she just took that she would be four, five or six. \"The last two years she has done that well. I am over the moon for her that she has got the first hundred out of the way under some pressure. \"I am mega happy for her but the ones that will stand out are the ones that really matter against the best teams in the world.\" This video can not be played Jones and Smith star as England seal comfortable WIndies win Get cricket news sent straight to your phone Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "Raised in Manchester, joining Liverpool - meet fun-loving Frimpong",
    "article_text": "Netherlands defender Jeremie Frimpong has spent the majority of his life in Britain \"You only live once, so while we're on this earth, just have fun, love others and just give it positive energy - and then life's good,\" says Jeremie Frimpong. Life is never dull when the Dutchman, who has completed aÂ£29.5m move to Liverpool from Bayer Leverkusen,is around. From entertaining goal celebrations, which include getting team-mates to shine his boots after scoring, to amusing post-match television interviews, right-sided defender Frimpong is all about fun. \"I like the pink by the way,\" he told German football expert Archie Rhind-Tutt, who was wearing a pink jacket, in one live post-match television interview. \"Very nice!\" \"Often in football it becomes so serious that player interviews can be a bit dull,\" former Germany midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger tells BBC Sport. \"Frimpong hasn't lost any of that freshness, that sense of 'I am enjoying what I am doing here'. He is different and he has such a refreshing tone.\" Another goal celebration with Leverkusen team-mate Amine Adli went viral on social media after Frimpong celebrated with asmoking gesture,,externaljust two days after Germanypartly decriminalised marijuana use. But don't be fooled by Frimpong's playful manner. Liverpool are investing in a serious talent, who started out in Manchester City's academy system, showed promise at Celtic before making a name for himself with Bayer Leverkusen. After four years in Germany, Frimpong is returning to England after helping Xabi Alonso's side break Bayern Munich's dominance and deliver a memorable league and cup double in 2023-24. Chris Sutton, a Premier League winner with Blackburn in 1994-95, adds: \"He's one who I think has been on the radar for a lot of the really high-profile clubs for a while now and now it is about him making that next step.\" Liverpool sign Frimpong from Leverkusen for Â£29.5m How does Liverpool target Frimpong compare with Alexander-Arnold? Frimpong (left) celebrates scoring for Bayer Leverkusen by placing his boot on team-mate Exequiel Palacios' knee Frimpong was born in Amsterdam - the fifth child of seven - although he has spent the majority of his life in Britain. He was seven when he arrived in England with his family and grew up in the east Manchester suburb of Clayton, playing for AFC Clayton on Saturday mornings before turning out for Clayton Villa a few hours later. Aged nine, he was scouted by Manchester City and placed in their academy, where he crossed paths with Jadon Sancho in the under-18s before the lattermoved to Borussia Dortmundin 2017. Frimpong went on to play for City's under-23s, played in the EFL Trophy at places like Rochdale, Crewe and Barnsley, and made appearances in the Uefa Youth League. But in 2019, at the age of 18, he left City for Celtic without playing a single minute of senior football. Celtic, who paid City Â£300,000, originally bought Frimpong to provide cover but within three months he played - and was sent off - in theScottish League Cup finalagainst Rangers, who were managed by former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard. Frimpong recovered from that red card to become a trusted member of the team, and just over a year later hesigned for Leverkusenin a deal worth around Â£10m. \"I've never seen a better kid than him,\" said Neil Lennon, his manager at Celtic. \"The quality of his play, the pace of his play, the end product.\" Former Celtic forward Sutton highlights Frimpong's electric pace as he adds: \"He was only at Celtic for a season or two and when he arrived you worried about him size-wise, but he gave the team such an attacking thrust. \"He is very small but size isn't everything. He is extremely quick, and definitely attack-minded. I think everyone viewed him as a better attacker than defender.\" Frimpong (right) has made 12 appearances for the Netherlands The arrival of Frimpong at Liverpool is intended to help soften the blow of losing Trent Alexander-Arnold, whowill become a Real Madrid playeron Sunday. According to his numbers, the 24-year-old is arriving at Anfield with serious potential. Frimpong was one of the strongest runners in the Bundesliga in 2024-25, making 1,021 sprints, 2,116 intensive runs, registered a maximum speed of 36.34 km/h, and covered a distance of 259.6km over 33 games. He is also versatile. In his final appearance of the season, a 4-2 home defeat by Borussia Dortmund on 11 May, he played as a midfielder and scored. It was Frimpong's 23rd goal in 133 Bundesliga matches. He also completed 38 sprints - more than any other player on the pitch. \"What I find phenomenal is his speed when he is standing still and those kind of first few steps,\" adds Hitzlsperger. \"That's what he's got and he loves going forward. So he is equipped to be a wing-back. \"Defensively he is still a very good player but he is not your typical right-back that you see playing for teams like Inter Milan who might defend for 90 minutes. \"Of course there is a lack of height with him. But with his pace, drive and determination to set goals up, to get to the byeline and pull balls back, then wing-back is probably his best position.\" Will Frimpong make an instant impact in the Premier League? With Netherlands team-mates Virgil van Dijk, Cody Gakpo and Ryan Gravenberch in the Liverpool dressing room, he will be surrounded by familiar faces as he looks to settle quickly. \"People are talking about Conor Bradley being Liverpool's first-choice right-back next season and I get that, but you need fierce competition and Frimpong would provide that,\" adds Sutton. \"I know what an attacking threat he is, how quick and dynamic he is, and how good he is in 1v1 situations.\" Frimpong has won two league titles - one with Celtic (2019-20) and one with Bayer Leverkusen (2023-24) Frimpong used the Bundesliga's 2024-25 winter break to visit Ghana, his parents' homeland, for the first time. \"It was English that was spoken in the house when I was growing up - that and the Ghanaian language called Twi,\" he said. \"My mum would normally speak that to me, but my brothers and sisters all speak English. I'm still working on my Dutch.\" While in Ghana, Frimpong visited an orphanage in the capital Accra and was moved by what he saw. \"I bought them food, we sat together and I asked lots of them what they would like to be,\" he added. \"The small children there didn't know me at all but they came straight to me and wanted me to take their hands. They showed me so much warmth. \"In spite of their situation and the whole environment, they were so full of joy. They smiled and we just played football and were happy.\" Thomas Hitzlsperger and Chris Sutton were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.

    "article_text": "More than 100 people have died and several others remain missing after a torrential downpour in the central Nigerian state of Niger, local authorities said on Friday. Floods submerged the town of Mokwa after the rains began on Wednesday night and continued into Thursday morning. Ibrahim Audu Hussein, a spokesperson for the state emergency management agency, said rescue efforts were still under way on Friday. “We have so far recovered 115 bodies and more are expected to be recovered because the flood came from far distance and washed people into the River Niger. Downstream, bodies are still being recovered,” Husseini told the AFP news agency. “So, the toll keeps rising.” More than 3,000 houses were submerged, he added. Mokwa, about 230 miles (370km) west of Nigeria’s capital, Abuja, is a commercial hub in Niger state, with many traders and heavy-duty vehicles often carrying goods to other regions. In Nigeria the rainy season usually runs from April to October. On Wednesday the Nigerian Meteorological Agency had issued aforecastof heavy storms for Abuja and 14 of the country’s 36 states including Niger. Niger, Nigeria’s largest state by landmass, is home to three major dams – Kainji, Jebba and Shiroro – which contribute significantly to the country’s electricity grid. A fourth dam is under construction. The state has beenprone to floodingin recent times. In April, water released from one of the dams destroyed more than 5,000 farms in 30 communities, including in Mokwa.Local news reportssuggested it was the sixth flood in the state this year. In 2022, floods in Nigeria killed more than 600 people, displaced about 1.4 million and destroyed 440,000 hectares of farmland. Experts havewarned of more extreme weather patternsdue to global heating.",

    "article_text": "The mother of the imprisoned British-Egyptian human rights activist Alaa Abd el-Fattah has been admitted to hospital after spending more than 240 days on hunger strike. Laila Soueif’s family said she had been admitted to St Thomas’ hospital in London on Thursday night with dangerously low blood sugar levels, but continues to refuse medical intervention that would provide her with calories. Soueif has been on hunger strike for 242 days in protest against the imprisonment of her son, who has been in jail in Egypt since September 2019. Last week, Souief told the Guardianshe weighed 49kgand had lost about 42% of her body weight since beginning the protest. In December 2021, Abd El-Fattah was sentenced to five years in prison for “spreading false news” and should have been released last year. His mother has not eaten any food since 29 September 2024, the date her son’s prison sentence was due to end. She had been surviving on herbal tea, black coffee, rehydration salts and 300-calorie liquid supplements. She resumed her full hunger strike on 20 May, saying: “Nothing has changed, nothing is happening.” UN investigators have declared Abd El-Fattah’s imprisonment in breach of international law. Earlier this year, Keir Starmer promised he would “do everything I can” to ensure his release. In a statement on Friday, Soueif’s family said she had received glucagon treatment, which induces the liver to break down stored fat to obtain glucose, but continued to refuse treatment that would provide her with calories. She was previously admitted to hospital in February, with doctors saying she was at “high risk of sudden death”. In March, she agreed to move to a partial hunger strike following a call between Starmer and the Egyptian president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.

For me and for my family the situation is urgent. We have used up more days than we ever thought we had. We need Alaa released now. We need Alaa with us now.

    "title": "Supreme court allows White House to revoke temporary protected status of many migrants",
    "article_text": "TheUS supreme courton Friday announced it would allow theTrump administrationto revoke the temporary legal status of hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan, Cuban, Haitian and Nicaraguan migrants living in the United States, bolstering the Republican president’s drive to step up deportations. The court put on holdBoston-based US district judge Indira Talwani’s order halting the administration’s move to end theimmigrationhumanitarian “parole” protections granted to 532,000 people by Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, potentially exposing many of them to rapid removal from the country, while the detailed case plays out in lower courts. As with many of the court’s emergency orders – after rapid appeals brought the case to their bench – the decision issued on Friday was unsigned and gave no reasoning. However two of the court’s three liberal-leaning justices,Ketanji Brown JacksonandSonia Sotomayor, publicly dissented. The court “botched” its assessment of whether the administration was entitled to freeze Talwani’s decision pending the litigation, Jackson wrote in an accompanying opinion. The outcome, Jacksonwrote, “undervalues the devastating consequences of allowing the government to precipitously upend the lives and livelihoods of nearly half a million noncitizens while their legal claims are pending”. Jackson also said that “it is apparent that the government seeks a stay to enable it to inflict maximum pre-decision damage.” She added that those living under parole protections in this case now face “two unbearable options”. One option is to “elect to leave the United States and thereby, confront ‘dangers in their native countries,’ experience destructive ‘family separation’ and possibly ‘forfeit any opportunity to obtain a remedy based on their … claims”, Jackson wrote. The other option is that they could remain in the US after parole termination and “risk imminent removal at the hands of government agents, along with its serious attendant consequences”. To Jackson, “either choice creates significant problems for respondents that far exceed any harm to the government … At a minimum, granting the stay would facilitate needless human suffering before the courts have reached a final judgement regarding the legal arguments at issue, while denying the government’s application would not have anything close to the kind of practical impact.” Immigration parole is a form of temporary permission under American law to be in the country for “urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit”, allowing recipients to live and work in the US. Biden, a Democrat, used parole as part of his administration’s approach to handling migrants entering at theUS-Mexico border. Such a status does not offer immigrants a long-term path towards citizenship but it can typically be renewed multiple times. A report from the American Immigration Councilfoundthat halting the program would, apart from the humanitarian effect, be a blow to the US economy, as households in the US where the breadwinners have temporary protected status (TPS) collectively earned more than $10bn in total income in 2021 while paying nearly $1.3bn in federal taxes. Trump called for ending humanitarian parole programs in an executive order signed on 20 January,his first day backin office. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) subsequently moved to terminate them in March, cutting short the two-year parole grants. The administration said revoking the parole status would make it easier to place migrants in a fast-track deportation process called “expedited removal”. The case is one of many that the Trump administration has brought in an emergency fashion to the nation’s highest judicial body seeking to undo decisions by judges impeding the president’ssweeping policies, includingseveral targetingimmigrants. The supreme court on 19 May also let Trump end TPS that had been granted under Biden to about 350,000 additional Venezuelans living in the United States, while that legal dispute plays out. Jackson was the only justice topublicly dissentthen, while House Democrats condemned the supreme court’s decision. In a bid to reduce unauthorized border crossings, Biden starting in 2022 offering limited extra pathways to come to the US legally, allowingVenezuelanswho entered the US by air to request a two-year parole if they passed security checks and had a US financial sponsor. Biden expanded that eligibility process to Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans in 2023 as his administration grappled with high levels of illegal immigration from those countries. The plaintiffs in this case, a group of migrants granted parole and Americans who serve as their sponsors, sued administration officials claiming they violated federal law governing the actions of government agencies. Talwani in April found that the law governing such parole did not allow for the program’s blanket termination, instead requiring a case-by-case review. The Boston-based first US circuit court of appeals declined to put the judge’s decision on hold and the government appealed. The justice department told the supreme court that Talwani’s order had upended “critical immigration policies that are carefully calibrated to deter illegal entry”, effectively “undoing democratically approved policies that featured heavily in the November election” that returned Trump to the presidency. The plaintiffs told the supreme court they would face grave harm if their parole is cut short given that the administration has indefinitely suspended processing their pending applications for asylum and other immigration relief. They said they would be separated from their families and immediately subject to expedited deportation “to the same despotic and unstable countries from which they fled, where many will face serious risks of danger, persecution and even death”. Speaking at the White House on Friday afternoon,Donald Trumppraised the decision, saying “a couple of hours ago we had a great decision from the supreme court that’s very important”.

    "title": "Google and Home Depot drop Pride Toronto sponsorship amid Trump’s DEI war",
    "article_text": "Inanother blowto one of the largest celebrations of LGTBQ+ people in North America,PrideTorontohas unexpectedly lost two more major corporate sponsors, just weeks before the festival in a setback the festival’s organizer says is direct result ofDonald Trump’s campaign to eradicate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in the US. GoogleandHome Depotboth announced their plans to abandon the festival in the form of one-line emails, said Kojo Modeste, the executive director of the Canadian event. Organizers have warned that the loss of sponsors will pose operational challenges for PrideTorontothat attracts 3 million attendees annually. Other organisations, including local trade unions, have stepped in to help make up the shortfall, but Modeste told the Guardian he was deeply worried about the celebration’s future. “Am I going to have to drastically cut what the festival looks like for 2026? This is not the place that I want to be in,” he said. Home Depot told the Guardian it continually reviews its non-profit giving and decided not to contribute this year. Google told the newspaper it would be supporting “Toronto Googlers” marching in the parade and “community moments” from Pride. The sudden exit of Google and Home Depot follows the departure in February ofthree other prominent sponsors. At the time, Modeste did not name them, but on Friday he revealed that they were Nissan, Adidas and Clorox. NissanCanadasaid it was unable to sponsor Pride in Toronto due to a “local decision” that it says was based on a reevaluation of marketing and media activities. Adidas and Clorox have been approached for comment. “These are American companies and they are showing their true colours,” said Modeste. “We thought they were with the community, but clearly, they’re not.” Corporate sponsorship not only goes towards paying staff, but hundreds of local artists and to keepPrideas a free event. Modeste said he grew up in a period before widespread Pride celebrations – and did not want that to be the experience of current younger generations. “I don’t want to be the one to have to make that decision, to take Pride away from the community,” he said. The White House’s condemnation of diversity and inclusion efforts has resulted in corporations shirking away from festivals that they once loudly supported, said Sui Sui, a professor at Toronto Metropolitan University whose research focuses on DEI initiatives. Sui said that the move also signals that commitments large sponsors made in the past were tenuous and motivated not because of genuine support, but because of the perceived profitability of aligning with such causes. Themonths-long purgeof US federal government workers by the Trump administration has resulted in the firings of tens of thousands of people, including those who worked in forwarding diversity and equity initiatives. Sui said that the chill aroundsponsors for pride eventshas also affectedNew York City and Philadelphia. Mastercard, Nissan, Pepsi, Garnier and more major backers have abandoned the New York celebration, while Target and Philadelphia Union exited Philly Pride 365. “Canada is following suit,” she said. For the future, Pride Toronto and other pride events may need to rely more significantly on grassroots efforts to keep events going, she said. “It’s for them to see who truly believes the importance of Pride.”",

    "title": "Recent Canadian wildfires are record-breaking – and will threaten US air quality for days",
    "article_text": "Enormous early-seasonwildfireshave erupted across the prairie provinces ofCanadathis week, taxing local emergency response and threatening a long stretch of dangerous air quality across eastern North America. The country’s largest fires – the Bird River fire and the Border fire – remain completely uncontainedin northern Manitoba. In Manitoba alone, wildfires have burned about 200,000 hectares already this year – already about three times the recent full-year average for the province. More than 17,000 people are in the process of being airlifted out of wildfire zones by the Canadian military, some of which now have no safe overland roads connecting them to the rest of the country. Wab Kinew, the Manitoba premier,declareda province-wide state of emergency on Wednesday, and Saskatchewan’s premier, Scott Moe,declared the sameon Thursday. “This is the largest evacuation Manitoba will have seen in most people’s living memory,” Kinew said at a press conference. “For the first time, it’s not a fire in one region, we have fires in every region. That is a sign of a changing climate that we are going to have to adapt to.” First Nations in Saskatchewanhave been particularly affectedby the fires this week, with some entire communities evacuated and occasionally trapped by road closures due to unsafe conditions.Drone footagecirculated by CBC showed towering flames and burned homes and cabins in northern Saskatchewan on Wednesday. Wildfires arealso burning in Alberta’s oil countryand have disrupted production and forced evacuations there this week. Satellite images captured over the past two weeks showed extreme fire behavior,including pyrocumulus clouds, that until recent years has been a rare occurrence in northern Canada – especially in the early days of the annual fire season. These clouds signify an especially hot and intense fire, and can help transport smoke high into the atmosphere where it can then travel long distances. In advance of the wave of wildfire smoke, the US National Weather Service has issued air quality alerts for parts of Minnesota between Lake Superior and the Canadian border. Weather forecasts show smoke continuing to billow across the border into the United States over the coming days, which could notably worsen air quality further downstream in cities such as Chicago, Detroit and Washington DC. Air quality in the worst-affected cities across the midwest and mid-Atlantic regions could reach the “red” category, signifying an air quality index exceeding 150 and unhealthy conditions for all groups. A prolonged period of unusually warm and dry conditions helped to intensify this week’s fires, continuing a trend worsened by climate change. The fire seasons of 2023 and 2024 were the worst two years in Canadian history. In June 2023, wildfire smoke transported southward from Canada turned skies orange over New York City, briefly making its airthe most unhealthy of any city in the world. The most recent assessments by Natural Resources Canada show that fire conditions arecurrently maxing out the scaleacross much of the regions where wildfires are now burning out of control. Government forecastersalso predictthat the fire seasons in the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia will all continue to be “well above average” for the remainder of the spring and summer. The health effects of wildfire smoke is an increasingly urgent area of medical research. Astudy published this weekfound for the first time that exposure to the fine soot particles of wildfire smoke can have adverse effects on the heart and lungs for months after the smoke clears. Otherrecent studieshave found that wildfire smoke worsens the risk of stroke, negatively impacts brain function, and can even interfere with fertility treatments. The worrying truth emerging from these studies is that there appears to be no safe level ofexposure to wildfire smoke, which can be up to 10 times more toxic than the soot and smog of typical urban air pollution.New datasuggest that thousands of people now die each year from wildfire smoke in the US, creating billions of dollars of additional costs to the economy. Expertsrecommendwearing a fitted N95 or similar mask if you are exposed to wildfire smoke outdoors, and using a portableair filtration systemif you are indoors.",

    "title": "Mexico steps into unknown with world’s first popular election of all judges: ‘A blind date with democracy’",
    "article_text": "On a heat-dazed afternoon in Culiacán, the capital of Mexico’s Sinaloa state, a speaker by the cathedral was droning through an advert for the judicial elections on loop when a plume of smoke appeared in the sky. A flicker of agitation ran through the plaza. Aftermonths of cartel conflict, Sinaloa is on edge. Yet on 1 June, it and the rest of Mexico will start to elect every judge in the country, from local magistrates to supreme court justices, by popular vote. It is a world-first democratic experiment, but one that has prompted warnings of low turnout, a political power grab and infiltration by organised crime. The reform is the most radical move made by the governing Morena party and its allies since theywon a congressional supermajoritylast year allowing them to change the constitution at will. Few disagree that Mexico’s judicial system needs change. Justice is inaccessible to many, corruption is commonplace and impunity is rampant. Morena claims its reform will address these issues by making the judiciary more responsive to popular opinion. But critics say it will bulldoze the separation of powers, and that by throwing the doors open to less qualified candidates whose campaigns may be backed by opaque interests – including organised crime groups – it could aggravate the very problems it seeks to solve. Delia Quiroa, a well-known advocate forMexico’s disappeared, is no fan of the reform. But she admits it has given her a chance to become a federal judge she would not otherwise have had. It is just the latest unexpected turn in a life that was shattered the moment her brother, Roberto, was disappeared on 10 March 2014. Though born in Culiacán, Quiroa moved to the border state of Tamaulipas when she was a child. She had been studying to become an engineer, but as the years stretched on with no sign of her brother, she retrained as a lawyer to force the authorities into action. Threats from criminal groups eventually displaced her family to Mexico City. Then last year they moved back to Sinaloa, which for years had been relatively calm owing to the dominance of the eponymous cartel. “People used to say that the narcos in Sinaloaleft the public out of [their fights],” Quiroa said, with a rueful smile. “Then this conflict began.” In July 2024, Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, who founded the Sinaloa cartel withJoaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, wasdetained by US authoritiesalong with one of Guzmán’s sons after a small plane touched down in Texas. El Mayoaccused El Chapo’s sonof betraying and delivering him to US authorities. Now a faction led by El Mayo’s son is waging war against another led by the two sons of El Chapo who remain free in Mexico. As the conflict enters a ninth month, it has left well over2,000 dead or disappeared. And it has made the judicial elections even more complicated. “The violence has hit the campaign,” said Quiroa. “You can’t always find people in the streets.” The city’s central market was Quiroa’s target for the day. Friends and family came along, handing out pamphlets with her logo: a spade and a gavel crossed over the scales of justice. “I try to explain that I have no political or economic interest in this,” said Quiroa. “That the only thing I want is a change in this country.” But as Quiroa bounced between market stalls, people’s responses did nothing to dispel fears of an uninformed vote come 1 June. Unlike in other elections, parties cannot support candidates, nor can candidates openly profess a partisan affiliation, even if theyclearly have one. Radio and TV spots are also banned, meaning largely unknown candidates are limited to handing out flyers and posting on social media. Then there is the sheer number of candidates. Voters will be faced with at least six ballot papers, some with dozens of names on them but little else. “It looks like an exam,” sighed Quiroa. Even an enthusiastic supporter of the reform – a butcher behind a pile of cow hooves, who celebrated the election as a chance for “the people to stop the robbery” – could not name a candidate. Others were sceptical, if not cynical. “I’m not going to vote for candidates I don’t know,” said one shoe shiner, who was reading a dog-eared biography of the 19th-century president Benito Juárez. “Just like I won’t eat a meal if I don’t know what’s in it. It’s common sense.” According to the president of the National Electoral Institute, voter turnout is expected to beless than 20%. Even though Morena is not allowed to back candidates, many assume the ruling party will use its unrivalled capacity to mobilise voters tohelp its preferred candidates– particularly for the supreme court, which has often acted as a check on Morena’s executive power, and a new disciplinary tribune, which will keep judges in line. “Morena wants to hoard all the power,” said the shoe shiner. “They don’t want to leave a crumb for anyone else.” But other interests, including organised crime, may also seize the opportunity. Defensorxs, a civil society organisation, has identified various “highly risky” candidates, including a lawyer who was counsel to El Chapo and a former state prosecutor in Michoacán accused of alleged involvement in the murder of two journalists. “I don’t think people have managed to find out who the candidates are and what each kind of position actually does,” said Marlene León Fontes of Iniciativa Sinaloa, a civil society organisation. “People will vote on the basis of personal connections or political parties. “It’s a blind date with democracy,” she said. If Quiroa emerges a judge, she says she will be an “iron fist” against corrupt and negligent authorities – not least when it comes to searching for the more than 120,000 people registered as disappeared, and identifying the72,000 bodies in Mexico’s morgues. “It was the feeling of being tortured by the authorities who should be protecting me that made me put myself forward as a candidate,” said Quiroa. Yet as far as Quiroa knows, she is the only candidate to have emerged from the many thousands searching for their relatives. “I’d have liked there to be more – and more victims of all kinds who are lawyers and human rights defenders,” said Quiroa. “But many people said they didn’t want to be part of the destruction of the judicial system.” Quiroa shares their anxiety. “This is an experiment,” she said. “And we don’t know how it’s going to go.”",

    "title": "Over a barrel: lack of sugar throws Cuba’s rum industry into crisis",
    "article_text": "It’s a crisis that would have sent a shiver down Ernest Hemingway’s drinking arm.Cuba’s communist government is struggling to process enough sugar to make the rum for his beloved mojitos and daiquiris. As summer rains bring theCaribbeanisland’s 2025 harvest to an end, a recent analysis by Reuters suggests that Cuba’s state-run monopoly, Azcuba, is likely to produce just 165,000 metric tonnes of sugar this year. That compares with harvests of 8m in the late 1980s. Michael Bustamante, chair of Cuban and Cuban-American Studies at the University of Miami, described the situation as “dismal”. “You have to go back to the 19th century to find numbers this low,” he said. Cuba is in the grip ofan all-encompassing economic crisis, and for the past few years has been importing sugar to feed its people, but rum producers do not have the luxury of importing. “The regulations provide that all the liquids have to come from within the country,” an industry executive said, speaking anonymously. It is particularly worrying because the island’s rum industry has been a rare bright spot in its economy. Big international luxury brands are involved, competing in world markets with distinctive Cuban spirits. Diageo, LVMH and Pernod Ricard all have ventures with the government in Havana, often involving tortuous legal structures to placate OFAC, the US Office of Foreign Assets Control, which polices Washington’ssix-decade-plus trade embargoagainst the island. These companies – and a small British/Norwegian upstart called the Island Rum Company – have invested heavily in their respective brands: Ron Santiago, Eminente, Havana Club and Black Tears. Now there are concerns about their prospects. “It is threatened,” said the executive. Rum as we know it was invented in Cuba in 1862 when a shopkeeper in the coastal city of Santiago thought he could do better than the rot gut then produced in pot stills on the country’s plantations worked by enslaved people. His name was Facundo Bacardí. He began using column stills to distill molasses, a byproduct of sugar refining, selecting theaguardienteliquor on the edge of the pure alcohol, before ageing it in oak. His family, and the rum they produced, became the most famous in Cuba, until they were forced out in the Castro brothers’ 1959 revolution. The Castros wanted Cuba to be financially independent of other countries, a never-ending issue for the island, and sugar was at the heart of their plans. In 1970, they mobilised 500,000 volunteers to create a 10m-tonne harvest. The effort fell short, but at least until the late 1980s Cuba produced around 8m tonnes a year. There was always a lack of investment in the machinery, though, which the government blames on the US embargo. Now the 133 mills at the time of the revolution have been reduced to 14, and only six reportedly still operate. “The sugar production numbers have been steadily decreasing for the better part of 20 years, but particularly over the last five,” said Bustamante. “I think it’s just as clear a signal as you can get over the dire straits of the economy overall.” The Enrique Varona sugar mill is in the settlement of Falla, around halfway along the island’s length. On a recent visit, the workers looked exhausted as they lathed a heavy bit of metal in the hope of keeping the great mill running. In contrast, Pernod Ricard’s distillery south of Havana is modern and slick. The French drinks company was the first of the big foreign operations to arrive, doing a deal with Corporación Cuba Ron, the state producer, in 1993. In return for an agreement not to allow other competitors in for 20 years, it took over the Havana Club brand, building sales from 300,000 cases to more than 4m. “They made a huge investment in a moment in which no one had the guts to invest in Cuba,” said Luca Cesarano, who until recently ran the rival brand of Ron Santiago. With the end of that agreement in 2013, others such as Diageo arrived. Unlike Pernod Ricard, they were not distilling themselves, but employing rum makers – known as maestros – to make specific spirits in Cuba’s state distilleries. They were also using historical collections of rum that the maestros had for years been storing in oak barrels across the country, even as the roofs of their bodegas grew full of holes. These high-end products have fed an international resurgence in rum. LVMH, the luxury powerhouse, arrived to make Eminente, creating the Hotel Eminente in Paris to promote it. The Island Rum Company has found a strong following in Cuba and abroad by associating itself with young Cuban musicians (its Black Tears brand takes its name from a Cuban song,Lagrimas Negras). But with the supply of molasses drying up, all this work is threatened. “I think the fourth quarter will be particularly tough,” said the executive. “There won’t be any alcohol.”",

    "article_text": "European and Asian countries should form a “positive new alliance” based on shared principles, security, defence and trade, away from the battling superpowers of the US and China,Emmanuel Macronhas said. Addressing the Shangri-La security dialogue in Singapore on Friday, the French president said the division between the US and China was the biggest threat in the world right now, but he also warned of thethreat from Russia and North Korea. He said it was crucial that allied nations act together to maintain credibility against aggressors. “We are living in a time of crisis and need new ways of cooperating,” he said in the keynote speech. “Our key challenge is how to preserve peace and stability and prosperity in this current environment. “We have a challenge of revisionist countries that want to impose – under the name of spheres of influence – spheres of coercion. Countries that want to control areas from the fringes ofEuropeto the archipelagos in the South China Sea … that want to appropriate resources, whether fishing or mineral, and crowd out others for their benefit.” Macron warned against a “division between the two superpowers and an instruction to all the others that you have to choose a side”. He said: “If we do this we kill the global order … all the institutions created after the second world war to preserve peace.” Macron’s pointed speech saidFrancewas and would remain a friend and ally of the US, but it did not want to be dependent, or affected “by the decisions of a single person”. “We live in a time of the erosion of longtime alliances,” he said. “The sense that their promise might not be so ironclad is ushering in a new instability. We see it every day.” However, he said the Trump administration’s request for other nations to take on more of the burden was a “fair” one and “we need Europeans to do much more for themselves”. Sitting in the audience for Macron’s speech was the US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, who in March accused Europeof being “pathetic”and “freeloading”, in a Signal chat with other Trump officials that was later published. Macron’s speech also warned that the failures of Europe and the US to end the Ukraine war, as well as double standards over Gaza that gave Israel a “free pass”, risked destroying the west’s remaining credibility. “What is at stake is the global order, and our credibility to protect the global order,” he said. Macron’s speech doubled down on comments earlier in the day calling for European countries to “harden their collective position” on Israel if there are not improvements to the humanitarian situation in Gaza, where the UN has said the entire population is at risk of famine. Israel accused Macronof a “crusade against the Jewish state” with his remarks. The defence minister, Israel Katz, said Israel vowed to build a “Jewish Israeli state” in the occupied West Bank, in a “clear message to Macron and his associates”. The Shangri-La dialogue draws senior officials from governments and militaries around the world for three days of speeches, expert panels and closed-door discussions. Hegseth is scheduled to speak on Saturday. Historically, the conference has hosted significant bilateral meetings, including one last year between Lloyd Austin, then the US defence secretary, and his Chinese counterpart, Dong Jun. However, this year Beijing sent just a single delegate, from the People’s Liberation Army National Defense University. It is the first time since 2019 thatChinahas not sent its defence minister. China-US relations have plummeted again since Trump took office this year, and many military-to-military channels have been suspended. Some analysts have suggested Dong’s absence is a missed opportunity for China, which could use the conference to further strengthen ties with nations that are perhaps more suspicious of the US. Others have noted that at previous conferences China has been criticised on panel after panel. Zhou Bo, a retired senior Chinese army colonel attending the conference, told the Guardian the absence was not unusual, as China had sent defence ministers only five times in the past. Zhou said he did not know why China had sent a smaller delegation, but he dismissed rumours that the minister was embroiled in corruption investigations, noting that Dong was traveling overseas. “Will the world change much because the Chinese defence minister will not come? Or are there not other occasions for China to talk about its own views? Yes, there are,” he said.",

    "article_text": "Donald Trumpdeclared that China has “totally violated its agreement” against the US on trade just two weeks after the countries reached a deal, raising fears that thetrade warwill continue to rattle the global economy. “I made a FAST DEAL withChinain order to save them from what I thought was going to be a very bad situation,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Friday morning. “Everybody was happy! That is the good news!!! The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US.” Trump’s post follows comments from the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, on Fox News that trade talks with China “are a bit stalled”, though he said that there will be more discussions with Chinese officials in the coming weeks. The White House has not offered any specific details on what has stalled trade talks. US stock markets turned negative after the news. The Dow ended the day up 0.13% while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq recorded small losses. It’s been nearly four months since Trump first put a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports in February, the start of the trade dispute that would escalate in the spring. After raising rates to 20% in March, a full-out trade war began with Trump imposing 145% tariffs on China, and China placing 125% tariffs on American goods in response. A truce was announced on 12 May, with Trump decreasing tariffs to 30% and China reducing US tariffs down to 10%. The White Housecalledthe deal “historic” and said it “set a path for future discussions to open market access for American exports”. But Trump’s post on Friday points to the continued instability amid the president’s trade war, which has shaken markets around the world for weeks. Investors appeared somewhat relieved by news late on Wednesday that a panel of judges on the US international court of tradeblockeda bulk of Trump’s broad tariffs, including country-specific import duties such as ones placed on China. But within 24 hours, a federal appeals courtpausedthe ruling, allowing Trump’s tariffs to stay in place.

    "title": "Hanoi bans The Economist’s issue featuring Vietnam’s leader on its cover, reports say",
    "article_text": "The latest print edition of the Economist, which features Vietnam’s top leader on its cover, has been banned in the country, the latest instance of media censorship in the communist, one-party state. The magazine carried an image of the Communist party General Secretary To Lam with stars on his eyes, alongside the headline “The man with a plan for Vietnam”, with an article carrying the subheading: “A Communist party hard man has to rescue Asia’s great success story”. Vietnamhas transformed over recent decades into a manufacturing powerhouse, and was one of Asia’s fastest growing economies last year. However, its export-reliant economy, which is heavily dependent on sending goods to the US, faces the threat of a 46% tariff announced early this year by Donald Trump. Noting the need for Vietnam to transform its economic strategy, the Economist article stated: “If Mr Lam fails, Vietnam will muddle on as a low-value-added production centre that missed its moment”, adding that reforms could, on the other hand, “propel 100m Vietnamese into the developed world, creating another Asian growth engine”. Reports by both Reuters and Bloomberg quoted unnamed distributors who said they could not obtain copies of the magazine or that it had been banned. An unnamed executive at distributor Ngay Moi told Reuters they had been ordered to “tear off” the cover and article about Lam, adding: “Later, we were ordered not to sell it at all.” An employee at a second distributor, Global Book Corporation, also told Reuters Vietnam’s ministry in charge of public information had banned the edition. Vietnam’s ministry of foreign affairs and the Economist did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Earlier this month, Vietnamese authorities ordered telecom providers to block the messaging app Telegram, accusing it of failing to cooperate with efforts to crack down on crime. An internal document reported by Reuters said that many Telegram groups “with tens of thousands of participants were created by opposition and reactionary subjects spreading anti-government documents”. Vietnam has little tolerance for dissent and maintains a tight control on the media, with press freedom groupReporters sans Frontièresranking it as among the worst in the world for media freedoms - at 173 place out of an index of 180 countries. The group describes Vietnam as “one of the world’s biggest prisons for journalists”. Aleksandra Bielakowska, advocacy manager for RSF said the decision to ban distribution of the Economist reflected the continued repression of press freedom in the country.“It is clear that the Vietnamese authorities consider a free press a challenge to its one-party rule, and will do anything in its power to silence independent voices,” Bielakowska said, citing the case of journalistPham Doan Trang, who has been detained for nearly five years by the regime. “While Vietnamese authorities seek rapprochement with democracies to boost its economy, the international community as a whole must seize this opportunity to put human rights and freedom of the press on the frontline of its negotiations,” she added.",

    "title": "Secret figures show Liberal party’s ageing membership in freefall in NSW and Victoria",
    "article_text": "The Liberal party’s ageing membership is in freefall in Australia’s two most populous states, according to multiple party sources, with one claiming their branch’s biggest expense in recent years has become “funeral wreaths”. The Liberals weredecimated in major cities at the federal election, losing the Victorian seats of Menzies and Deakin as well as Banks and Hughes in Sydney and possiblyBradfield, where the electoral commission is conducting a recount. The story in the other capitals was no better. Party membership numbers are closely guarded by office bearers, but Guardian Australia has spoken to several party sources in bothNew South Walesand Victoria, who were willing to disclosure figures on the condition they were not named. In Victoria, three sources said membership numbers were between 9,000 and 10,000, with the majority based in the federal electorates of Kooyong, held byteal independent Monique Ryan, and Goldstein, which willlikely be won by Liberal Tim Wilson. A former member of the Victorian Liberal executive said the division had about 15,000 members close to 20 years ago. The party has since shed members, according to the source, and the average age of those who remain has climbed to 68. “One of the biggest expenses we used to have [at our local branch] was on funeral wreaths,” they said. “We’d be down at the florist every week handing over $70.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Both state divisions are urging members to renew their annual memberships after a bruising federal election loss. One Victorian source said as of mid-May, about 30% of members had not renewed. In NSW, one Liberal source said party membership dipped below 10,000 after the state election loss in March 2023, before climbing to close to 12,000 by the end of the year. Another source said the current numbers were somewhere between 8,000 and 10,000. Earlier this month, NSW Liberal officials confirmed about 5,000 people had allowed their membership to lapse in recent years. Inan opinion piece in the Australian Financial Review,they blamed the decline on factional fighting in branches. “Our membership has declined by more than 1,000 in just a year, many branches refuse to support in any way their sitting MP not of their faction and we have lost successive state and federal elections,” three senior party elders wrote. Slightly more than 600 applicants have been refused membership, according to the party officials, due to concerns they may impact the power balance within branches. The NSW Liberal party’s annual disclosures to the state electoral commission also show a significant drop in revenue from members. In 2018-19, the party generated $1.38m from “paid individuals” who had either a membership, an affiliation or a party subscription. That figure dropped to $836,770 last financial year, according to disclosures. “We need to actively go out and seek people and build personal relationships with them in an organisation that isn’t transactional, but transformational,” said one NSW Liberal source. “It’s not about getting people to door knock or donate, it’s about working together to help change government policy.” Several Liberal sources in both states, including federal MPs, have complained about losing volunteers and donors to third-party groups, such as Advance Australia. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion In Victoria, Advance’s federal election campaign wasbankrolled by a $500,000 donationfrom the state branch’s nominated entity, the Cormack Foundation. When contacted for a response to these concerns earlier this month, Advance’s executive director, Matthew Sheahan,accused “bed-wetting anonymous Liberals”of “looking to blame everyone but themselves”. One former Liberal, who is now involved in political campaigns for third-party groups, said they used to direct members from seats such as Goldstein and Kooyong to other electorates in Victoria. But since the rise of teal independents, they were now required in their own seats. They said as a result, the party had become increasingly dependent on “non-cause actors”, who are not party members, to support them at other, marginal polling booths. They referred to reports that members ofthe Exclusive Brethren religious sectwere handing out how-to-vote cards before the 3 May poll, despite the church barring followers from voting. “Labor has the labour movement, the Greens the environment, Nationals the country,” the source said. “The Liberals aren’t a movement. Maybe, back in the day, they were an anti-communist movement but there are no communists in Labor any more.” One Victorian Liberal MP downplayed the drop in numbers and said a decline in volunteers was common across almost all community groups – not just political organisations. They said the cost of living had contributed to a “slight decline” in membership. Sussan Ley, onbeing elected as leader, pledged to rebuild the party in major cities and appeal to a broader subsection of Australian society. “If we stay focused, our political movement has the foundations to rebuild and once again guide Australians toward a better future,”Ley said earlier this month. “That starts with accepting the fact that Australians sent a clear message at the election. We must listen, change and develop a fresh approach.” With additional reporting by Anne Davies",

    "title": "After a week of spectacular self-sabotage, the Victorian Liberal party’s pain is only just beginning",
    "article_text": "It was meant to be the Victorian Liberals’ week. Instead, the party – now almost synonymous with political self-sabotage – has imploded once again. And it’s likely only going to get worse from here as the countdown officially begins for former leader John Pesutto topay the $2.3m in legal fees he owes Moira Deeming or face bankruptcyafter he was found in December to have defamed her. “The pain for John may be about to end, but the pain for others may be just about to begin,” one of Pesutto’s supporters warned. The week had started with a sense of optimism fromPesutto’s successor as opposition leader, Brad Battin, and his team. Aftermachete-wielding rival gangs sent a shopping centre into lockdownat the weekend, the Labor government on Mondayrushed to ban the sale of the kniveswithin 48 hours. It was a move the Liberals had advocated for since 2023, giving them a rare “we told you so” moment. They also had their budget reply on Tuesday, headlined by a policy designed to win back young voters: abolishing stamp duty for properties under $1m. But whatever momentum the Liberals were hoping to build vanished before the shadow treasurer stood up to deliver his speech. Earlier on Tuesday, a party room meeting was called to discuss what – if anything – was being done by Battin to avert a byelection in the seat of Hawthorn – which will occur if Pesutto is bankrupted and therefore disqualified from parliament. The issue of the byelection – which many Liberals believe the party would lose – was raised by the Sandringham MP, Brad Rowswell, who had attempted to discuss it during a shadow cabinet meeting on Monday but was told it was a matter for the broader party room. After facing criticism that such a discussion would distract from the party’s messaging, Rowswell deferred the discussion altogether. But the matter still made headlines and overshadowed the budget response. A Liberal MP loyal to Battin said it was an intentional move to “destabilise” the leader, while a detractor said it was a “valid question everyone has been asking”. It only got worse for Battin, when a letter from Deeming’s lawyers to Pesutto was leaked to the media on Wednesday. It suggested that in the event of Pesutto’s bankruptcy, Deeming would seek to recover her legal costs from those who contributed to his defence fund. The list includes three former Liberal premiers, Ted Baillieu, Denis Napthine and Jeff Kennett, two sitting MPs, Georgie Crozier and David Southwick, and other party figures who have supported the Hawthorn MP. According to one Pesutto supporter, the letter had the effect of “galvanising support” for the beleaguered former leader, as it “showed it won’t end with him if he is bankrupted”. “It will engulf the entire party with months of hearings and political bloodletting ahead.” Deeming’s lawyers are set to initiate bankruptcy proceedings on Monday, after Pesutto failed to meet Friday’s deadline. Pesutto will then have a further three weeks to pay the $2.3m owed, of which sources say he has raised around a third. Deeming’s lawyers have also applied to the federal court for leave to issue sub­poenas to obtain communications between Pesutto and those who donated to his unsuccessful legal defence. “It will be a shit show for all involved and a nightmare for the party,” another Pesutto supporter said. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email It’s no wonder Battin faced relentless questioning on the matter. On Wednesday, he repeated the same line that he would keep his conversations confidential and urged his colleagues to stay “on message”. But Southwick broke ranks, urging people to “step up” to prevent a Hawthorn byelection. “The fact that [Pesutto’s] fighting for his job, fighting for his livelihood – it is horrific, regardless of what people think about the situation,” he told reporters. As one Liberal MP privately quipped: “They were the type of comments Brad should have made a fortnight ago”. They weren’t alone in their criticism. Several Liberal MPs have expressed frustration that Battin failed to show leadership during a week when the party desperately needed him to. Even some who backed him in the December leadership spill are now questioning their decision. The Herald Sun has already reportedmurmurs of a leadership challenge– less than six months into Battin’s tenure. In a sign of how desperate the situation has become, one rumour doing the rounds is that former MP Matt Bach could be asked to return from the UK to lead. Other names being bandied about are Matthew Guy, in what would be his third go as leader, or Jess Wilson, who lost her leadership bid in December. If all this wasn’t enough, the cherry on top of a shocker week were several stories scrutinising expense claims by Battin’s deputy, Sam Groth, including allegations that he used a taxpayer funded, chauffeur-driven car – assigned to Crozier – to take himself and his wife from a fundraising event at the Australian Open to their home in Rye and spending $3,269 on hotel stays after sporting events. Groth, who is also the opposition spokesperson for tourism, sport and events, on Friday said his conduct “was and is above board”. “It has all been officially disclosed. There is nothing to hide,” he said. For her part, Croziertold the ABCshe was “incredibly disappointed” over the issue, and that “Victorians deserve a lot better”. “I think that Sam needs to explain his actions – I can’t,” she said. Again, Battin was forced to front the press on Friday on the defensive. “It’s pretty obvious we’ve had some tensions in the party at the moment. And I’m continuing to work through that,” he said. If anything this week is proof, yet again, that the VictorianLiberal partyis too often its own worst enemy. With additional reporting by Henry Belot This article was amended on 31 May 2025. Jess Wilson challenged for Victorian Liberal leadership, not deputy leadership as stated in an earlier version.",

    "title": "Australia’s emissions up slightly in 2024 as Labor faces heat over ‘climate-wrecking’ gas project",
    "article_text": "Australia’s climate-heating emissions increased fractionally last year as pollution from fossil fuel power plants rose for the first time in a decade, and domestic air travel and use of diesel-powered cars and trucks hit record highs. The jump in emissions was small – just 0.05% – due to falls in pollution from other sectors. But the direction was at odds with the Albanese government’s pledge to cut pollution to reach targets for 2030 and 2050. The data was released on Friday, two days after the environment minister, Murray Watt, announced he planned toapprove a 40-year life extension for one of Australia’s biggest fossil fuel developments– Woodside Energy’s North West Shelf liquified natural gas (LNG) processing facility in the Pilbara. Based on the Burrup peninsula, in Murujuga country, the North West Shelf is Australia’s third biggest industrial polluter,responsible for about 1.4%of the country’s annual climate pollution. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has rejected concerns about the facility’s emissions continuing for decades after 2050, saying the national goal was “net zero, not zero”, implying ongoing fossil fuel use could be justified by using acontentious carbon offset scheme. His comments echoed languageused in 2021by the Coalition’s then emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, when defending climate policies under Scott Morrison. Thequarterly greenhouse gas inventorysaid the increase in national emissions last year may be short-lived, with preliminary data suggesting they fell in the first quarter this year. Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletter Emissions last year were estimated to be 446.4m tonnes of carbon dioxide, 0.2m tonnes higher than in 2023. The increase is largely due to pollution from electricity generation rising by 2.2%, reversing a 10-year trend. Australians used more electricity overall, and there was less hydro power available than usual during winter. Solar use was up, but the extra demand was otherwise met by more coal and gas. Initial data for the March quarter suggest the long-term trend of pollution from electricity falling should restart this year. This has been backed bya separate report by the Australian Energy Market Operator. At the end of last year emissions from power generation was 23.7% lower than in 2005. Experts expect it to continue to fall as a government underwriting programannounced in November 2023supports an influx of new large-scale solar, wind and batteries. But emissions from transport continue to surge as Australians fly more and burn more diesel in bigger cars and trucks. Pollution from the transport sector was up 1.9% last year. It has skyrocketed 20.8% since 2005. Vehicle efficiency standards introduced last year require auto companies to reduce the average pollution from new cars each year, but they are expected to only gradually affect total transport emissions. Government officials estimated national pollution was 27% below 2005 levels, largely due to a change in the amount of carbon dioxidethat is absorbed by the land and forests. The Albanese government has a legislated target of a 43% cut by 2030 and has promised a 2035 target later this year. The climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, said Labor was on track to reach the 2030 target but there was “more to do” to get there. Sign up toClear Air Australia Adam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisis after newsletter promotion “Industrial emissions are now lower than they were during Covid-19, even as the economy has recovered,” he said. “We need to keep going, and ensuring we’re delivering downward pressure on emissions across the economy.” The Greens leader, Larissa Waters, said Labor had failed two climate tests: pollution was going up, and it had approved the “climate-wrecking North West Shelf dirty gas extension”. “During the last term of parliament Labor approved over 30 new coal and gas projects and it doesn’t look like they’re slowing down any time soon,” she said. Albanese this week defended the North West Shelf extension by saying gas was needed along with batteries and pumped hydro storage to “firm” renewable energy generation in the electricity grid. The government’s target is that 82% of electricity will come from renewable energy by 2030. “You can’t have renewables unless you have firming capacity. Simple as that,” Albanese said. “You don’t change a transition through warm thoughts.” Asked about the WA development, Albanese said the Tomago aluminium smelter in New South Wales’ Hunter Valley relied on gas to firm renewable energy, and WA’s main electricity grid would become more reliant on gas as the state closed its remaining coal-fired power plants. The prime minister did not say how much gas from the facility was destined to be used in Australia.According to analysis of recent data, the overwhelming bulk of the gas produced on the North West Shelf and elsewhere in WA – 81% – was exported. Another 7% was used by the gas industry as part of the production process. About 8% was used for gas-fired electricity generation in WA. None was used at Tomago. Critics have challenged the economic and climate basis for a decades-long extension of the processing facility’s life. Alex Hillman, from the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility and a former Woodside Energy climate change adviser, said analysts from the International Energy Agency had projected the world was heading foran “LNG glut” later this decade. “There is no commercial justification to add further LNG supply, and there is certainly no climate justification,” he said. “Whilst there is major flooding in New South Wales and a major drought in South Australia, these are emissions that are going to cause Australians and investment portfolios further harm as the physical impacts of climate change increase.”",

    "title": "Étienne-Émile Baulieu, French scientist who invented abortion pill, dies aged 98",
    "article_text": "French scientist Étienne-Émile Baulieu, the inventor of the abortion pill, has died at the age of 98 at his home in Paris. The doctor and researcher, who achieved worldwide renown for his work that led to the pill, had an eventful life that included fighting in the French resistance and becoming friends with artists such as Andy Warhol. “His research was guided by his commitment to the progress made possible by science, his dedication to women’s freedom, and his desire to enable everyone to live better, longer lives,” Baulieu’s wife, Simone Harari Baulieu, said on Friday. Baulieu’s most famous discovery helped create the oral drug RU-486, also known asmifepristone, which provided a safe and inexpensive alternative to surgical abortion to millions of women across the world. For decades, he pushed governments to authorise the drug, facing fierce criticism and sometimes threats from opponents of abortion. When Wyoming became the first US state to outlaw the abortion pill in 2023, Baulieu told AFP it was “scandalous”. Then aged 96, Baulieu said he had dedicated a large part of his life to “increasing the freedom of women”, and such bans were a step in the wrong direction. On news of his death, the French equality minister, Aurore Bergé, passed on her condolences to Baulieu’s family, saying on X he was “guided throughout his life by one requirement: human dignity”. Born on 12 December, 1926 in Strasbourg to Jewish parents, Étienne Blum was raised by his feminist mother after his father, a doctor, died. He changed his name to Émile Baulieu when he joined the French resistance against Nazi occupation at the age of 15, then later adding Étienne. After the war, he became a self-described “doctor who does science”, specialising in the field of steroid hormones. Invited to work in the US, Baulieu was noticed in 1961 by Gregory Pincus,known as the father of the contraceptive pill, who convinced him to focus on sex hormones. Back inFrance, Baulieu designed a way to block the effect of the hormone progesterone, which is essential for the egg to implant in the uterus after fertilisation. This led to the development of mifepristone in 1982. Dragged before the courts and demonised by US anti-abortion groups who accused him of inventing a “death pill”, Baulieu refused to back down. “Adversity slides off him like water off a duck’s back,” Simone Harari Baulieu told AFP. “You, a Jew and a resistance fighter, you were overwhelmed with the most atrocious insults and even compared to Nazi scientists,” the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said as he presented Baulieu with France’s top honour, the Grand-Croix de la Legion d’Honneur, in 2023. “But you held on, for the love of freedom and science.” In the 1960s, literature fan Baulieu became friends with artists such as Andy Warhol. He said he was “fascinated by artists who claim to have access to the human soul, something that will forever remain beyond the reach of scientists.” Baulieu kept going into his Parisian office well into his mid-90s. “I would be bored if I did not work any more,” he said in 2023. His recent research has included trying to find a way to prevent the development of Alzheimer’s disease, as well as a treatment for severe depression, for which clinical trials are under way across the world. “There is no reason we cannot find treatments” for both illnesses, he said. Baulieu was also the first to describe how the hormone DHEA was secreted from adrenal glands in 1963. He was convinced of the hormone’s anti-ageing abilities but drugs using it only had limited effects, such as in skin-firming creams. In the US, Baulieu was also awarded the prestigious Lasker prize in 1989. After his first wife, Yolande Compagnon, died, Baulieu married Simone Harari in 2016. He leaves behind three children, eight grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren, according to the statement released by his family.",

Earlier this month Damascus had announced indirect talks withIsraelto calm tensions, and the US called for a “non-aggression agreement” between the two countries, which are technically at war. “A strike from Israeli occupation aircraft targeted sites close to the village of Zama in the Jableh countryside south of Latakia,” state television said. State news agency Sana reported one civilian was killed “as a result of an Israeli occupation airstrike targeting the vicinity of Zama”. The Israeli military said it had “struck weapon storage facilities containing coastal missiles that posed a threat to international and Israeli maritime freedom of navigation, in the Latakia area of Syria”. “In addition, components of surface-to-air missiles were struck,” it said, adding it would “continue to operate to maintain freedom of action in the region, in order to carry out its missions and will act to remove any threat to the State of Israel and its citizens”.

    "article_text": "Gaza is “the hungriest place on Earth”, according to the UN, which has warned that the Palestinian territory’s entire population is at risk of famine. Jens Laerke, a spokesperson for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said the territory was “the only defined area – a country or defined territory within a country – where you have the entire population at risk of famine. One hundred per cent of the population at risk of famine,” he said on Friday. “Gaza is the hungriest place on Earth.” Laerke detailed the difficulties faced by the UN in delivering humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip. Nine hundred trucks of humanitarian aid had been authorised byIsraelto enter the strip since the blockade was partially lifted, but so far only 600 had been off-loaded on the Gaza side of the border, and a smaller number of shipments had then been picked up for distribution within the territory because of security considerations, he said. Laerke said the mission to deliver aid was “in an operational straitjacket that makes it one of the most obstructed aid operations not only in the world today, but in recent history”. Once truckloads entered Gaza, they were often “swarmed by desperate people”, he said. Daniel Meron, Israel’s UN ambassador, rejected the claim, saying UN agencies “cherrypick the facts to paint an alternative version of reality and demonise Israel”. “In a desperate effort to remain relevant, they lambast the best efforts of Israel and its partners to facilitate delivery of humanitarian aid to the civilian population. UN feedsHamas, we make sure aid gets to those in need,” he wrote on X. In a reflection of the increasingly dire conditions inside the territory, a UN spokesperson said late on Friday that “armed individuals” hadraided a warehouse at a field hospital in Deir al-Balah, “looting large quantities of medical equipment, supplies, medicines, nutritional supplements that was intended for malnourished children”. Hamas said on Friday it was“thoroughly reviewing” Israel’s responseto a US proposal for a Gaza ceasefire deal, although one of the militant group’s officials said the plan did not meet any of the Palestinians’ “just and legitimate demands”. Hamas has described the latest proposal as more biased in favour of Israel than previous versions. It said it was consulting other “Palestinian factions”, a term referring to other groups operating under Hamas’s rule in Gaza, such as Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Late on Thursday,Benjamin Netanyahutold the families of hostages held in Gaza that Israel had accepted the draft deal presented by Steve Witkoff, Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy. Deep differences between Hamas and Israel have stymied previous attempts to restore a ceasefire that broke down in March after only two months when Israel renewed its offensive. Israel has insisted that Hamas disarm completely and be dismantled as a military and governing force, and that all 58 hostages still held in Gaza be returned before it will agree to end the war. The Israeli government fears a lasting ceasefire and withdrawal would leave Hamas with significant influence in Gaza, even if it surrenders formal power. The Israelis are concerned that with time Hamas may be able to rebuild its military might and eventually launch more 7 October-style attacks. On the other hand, Hamas fears Israel could break the ceasefire again and resume the war, which the Israeli government would be permitted to do after 60 days under the deal. The militant group has rejected the demand to give up its weapons and says Israel must pull its troops out of Gaza and commit to ending the war. Netanyahu also faces political constraints: his far-right coalition partners have threatened to bring down his government if he ends the war too soon. That would leave the prime minister more vulnerable to prosecution on longstanding corruption charges and to investigations into the failures surrounding the Hamas attack in 2023. The far-right security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, said on Friday it was time to use “full force” in Gaza. “Mr Prime Minister, after Hamas rejected the deal proposal again – there are no more excuses,” Ben-Gvir said on his Telegram channel. “The confusion, the shuffling and the weakness must end. We have already missed too many opportunities. It is time to go in with full force, without blinking, to destroy, and kill Hamas to the last one.” The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a private logistics group backed by the US and endorsed by Israel, expanded its food distribution to a third site on Thursday. Heavily criticised by the UN and other aid groups as inadequate and flawed, the group’s operation began this week in Gaza after Israel’s 11-week blockade on aid entering the territory. Laerke said that by having people collect aid rather than delivering it to them where they are, they become a target for looters once they leave the site. “It is so desperate and tragic and frustrating, and wildly unhumanitarian,” he said. The launch was marred bytumultuous scenes on Tuesdaywhen Israeli troops opened fire on a large crowd, killing at least one civilian and injuring dozens. The chaotic start to the operation has raised international pressure on Israel to get more food in and halt the fighting in Gaza. GHF says it has so far supplied about 1.8m meals, and plans to open more sites in the coming weeks. Netanyahu has faced growing criticism from key international allies in recent days. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said on Friday that abandoning war-torn Gaza to its fate and giving Israel a “free pass” would kill the west’s credibility with the rest of the world. “If we abandon Gaza, if we consider there is a free pass for Israel, even if we do condemn the terrorist attacks, we will kill our credibility,” Macron told a top defence forum in Singapore, adding: “And this is why we do reject double standard.” Israel responded by accusing the French president of undertaking a “crusade against the Jewish state”. “There is no humanitarian blockade. That is a blatant lie,” Israel’s foreign ministry said in a statement, defending its efforts to allow in aid. “But instead of applying pressure on the jihadist terrorists, Macron wants to reward them with a Palestinian state. No doubt its national day will be October 7.” Macron said recognition of a Palestinian state with conditions was “not only a moral duty, but a political necessity”. A “hardened stance” would mean dropping an assumption that human rights were being respected, and applying sanctions, he said. Israeli jets continued to pound Gaza on Friday, killing at least 14 people in Jabaliya refugee camp, according to medics who received the bodies at al-Shifa hospital in northern Gaza. The previous day, Israeli strikes killed 45 people, including 23 in the Bureij camp in central Gaza Strip, Palestinian medical workers said. Israel launched its campaign in Gaza in response to the devastating Hamas attack in southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 hostages taken into Gaza, according to Israeli tallies. The campaign has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians, Gaza health officials say, and left the territory in ruins.",

    "title": "Trump and special envoy Witkoff stand to reap rewards from official business",
    "article_text": "President Trumpreceived plenty of attention this monthwhen he happily accepted a $400m Boeing 747 from the Persian Gulf emirate of Qatar. “Only a FOOL would not accept this gift on behalf of our country,” Trump posted on social media. But Trump and his golf buddy turned special negotiator Steve Witkoff landed a much bigger gift this month, likely to enrich them far more:a $2bn investmentin their new cryptocurrency venture from the emirate of Abu Dhabi. The investment by a firm controlled by Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund will go toWorld Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency firm whose biggest beneficiaries are the Trump and Witkoff families. Thanks to Abu Dhabi’s purchase of their “stablecoin”, the Trumps and Witkoffs will collect hefty fees and could reap hundreds of millions of dollars in interest payments. The deal isn’t as headline-grabbing as Qatar’s plane, but it’s a lot more valuable. It was the biggest single purchase of World Liberty’s cryptocoins yet – an immense injection of revenue into Trump’s most lucrative personal money-making scheme. None of this is normal. Presidents don’t usually maintain private businesses that sell investment vehicles to foreign leaders who seek favor with the United States. Nor do they appoint their private business partners as diplomatic envoys to negotiate with the same leaders over war and peace. But Trump and Witkoff have found a vastly rewarding way to straddle the line between public service and private profit. Abu Dhabi is the wealthiest and most powerful member of theUnited Arab Emirates, an oil-rich federation of seven Persian Gulf emirates. After Abu Dhabi invested $2bn in the Trump-Witkoff stablecoin, Trump agreed to allow the UAE to buy more advanced AI semiconductors from American companies. “It’s a very big contract,” the president observed. In 2023, the Biden administration sharply restricted exports of advanced chips to the UAE because of fears that some of the technology could leak to China, which has deep economic ties with the emirates. Witkoff and Trump first met in the 1980s, when Witkoff was a lawyer working on one of Trump’s Manhattan real-estate deals. Witkoff says he adopted Trump as a role model; “I learned the business from him,” he told Tucker Carlson in March. Over time, the two dealmakers became golf buddies, friends and business partners. After Trump lost the White House in 2020, Witkoff became one of his staunchest defenders, and testified as a character witness at Trump’s 2024 New York trial on business fraud charges. It was Witkoff who first alerted Trump to the opportunity to take over a fledgling cryptocurrency firm that their respective sons had discovered, World Liberty Financial. The two families negotiated equity interests in the venture, which now showcases Trump on its website as its “chief cryptocurrency advocate”. Witkoff is listed as a “co-founder”. A heroic photograph of Trump dominates the website. A Trump family subsidiary owns 60% of World Liberty and is entitled to 75% of net income from its coin sales, according to the website. A Witkoff family firm is entitled to 12.5%. The firm says it sold more than $550m in cryptocurrency “tokens” in its first five months of operation, generating undisclosed amounts of fees and profits for the Trump and Witkoff families. Most of the sales occurred after Trump’s election. Before Trump’s inauguration, when he wasthe president-elect’s personal envoy for Gaza, Witkoff promoted World Liberty at a crypto investors’ conference in Dubai. The meeting’s organizers billed him as both a co-founder of World Liberty and the incoming president’s key man for the Middle East. During the same period, Witkoff met – in his diplomatic role – Saudi Arabia’s Mohammed bin Salman, the UAE’s Mohamed bin Zayed, and Qatar’s Tamim bin Hamad, all of whom command enormous sovereign wealth funds. After Trump’s inauguration, Witkoff helped broker Qatar’s offer to donate a spare 747 to the president, according to the New York Times. Witkoff came equipped with plenty of experience doing business in the Gulf. He knew the heads of several sovereign wealth funds from earlier real-estate deals. A UAE-controlled fund invested in his purchase of New York’s Park Lane hotel in 2013; in 2016, the Qatari fund took the troubled property off their hands. When Russia’s Vladimir Putin sent a special envoy to Washington to talk with Witkoff about Ukraine, his emissary wasn’t a diplomat; it was Kirill Dmitriev, the head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund. Once Witkoff landed his government post as Trump’s all-purpose peace negotiator, he appears to have stepped back from active involvement in World Liberty. A Witkoff spokesman at the state department, Edgar Vasquez, said the envoy “does not discuss WLF [World Liberty Financial] or any other personal business while conducting his official duties”. His son Zach Witkoff has acted as the firm’s chief overseas salesman instead. The fact that Zach’s father is one of Trump’s closest confidants appears to have helped open doors. When Zach Witkoff visited Pakistan last month, he met the country’s powerful army chief and its prime minister, an unusual level of access for an obscure cryptocurrency firm. The prime minister’s officenoted in a news releaseon the meeting that Zach is “the son of Steve Witkoff”. No modern precedent exists for a US diplomatic envoy so deeply tangled in a president’s private business interests. “I can’t think of any parallel,” said Robert Dallek, a retired UCLA historian who has written biographies of Franklin D Roosevelt, John F Kennedy and Lyndon B Johnson. Presidents have sent special envoys abroad since the early days of the republic. George Washington sent Gouverneur Morris, a delegate to the constitutional convention, to London in 1789 to negotiate peace with Britain. Roosevelt sent investment banker Averell Harriman to Moscow in 1941 to talk with Stalin. But historians say they can’t think of any instance in which a special envoy was also the president’s partner in a private moneymaking venture. In more recent history, then secretary of state Hillary Clinton came under fire after foreign donors made big donations to the private Clinton Foundation, prompting allegations the family was mixing public and private interests. Trump and other Republicans denounced that arrangement as unethical. “It’s a criminal enterprise – Saudi Arabia giving $25m, Qatar,” Trump said in 2016. “These are people that kill women and treat women horribly. And yet you take their money.” “My goal is to keep foreign money out of American politics,” Trump said. This time it’s Democratic senators who are raising alarms. “The White House is open for business, and the Trump family is proudly advertising to the world where to send the check,” Chris Murphy of Connecticut told the Guardian. “The Trumps and the Witkoffs are in business together making money off their government positions,” he said. “It’s just plain as day.” Murphy charged that the administration’s announcement that it plans to relax restrictions on semiconductor exports to the UAE, a change the emirates have long sought, is a “quid pro quo” for Abu Dhabi’s investment in the Trump-Witkoff crypto venture. “You wouldn’t be investing in Trump stablecoin unless you want something from him,” Murphy said. “It’s all about getting access to Trump and ultimately getting favorable policy from the United States.” Murphy and other Democrats also charge that once the emirates have those chips, it will be difficult for the United States to prevent some of them from reaching China, which also has close ties to the emirates. “China will be right there waiting to get their hands on that technology,” he warned. Sign up toHeadlines US Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion To ethics officials from previous administrations, the Trump and Witkoff stakes in World Liberty raise red flags. By reaping income from the firm’s crypto sales, both Trump and Witkoff appear to be violating the US constitution’s emoluments clause, which prohibits federal officers from accepting payments from foreign governments, they said. “If Witkoff owns an interest in World Liberty and there is a UAE-controlled fund investment in World Liberty, that is likely a violation of the emoluments clause,” Richard W Painter, the top White House ethics official during the George W Bush administration, said in an email message. “His intentions don’t matter.” Witkoff is also subject to administrative regulations enforced by the office of government ethics, Painter and other former officials noted. “An employee may not use their public office for their own private gain, for the endorsement of any product, service, or enterprise … or for the private gain of friends, relatives, or persons with whom the employee is affiliated,” the OGE rules state. The regulations also admonish employees to “ensure that the performance of their official duties does not give rise to an appearance of use of public office for private gain”. Witkoff says he has begun the paperwork to divest his interest in World Liberty by transferring his interest to his adult sons. But that move, which he hasn’t completed, may not insulate him fully from the ethics laws. He has already collected substantial gains from his equity in World Liberty. And even after a divestment, if his sons profit thanks to his diplomatic post, that would appear to be a violation of the OGE regulations. Trump is exempt from all conflict of interest regulations, because Congress decided long ago that restricting a president’s authority because of his financial interests would be both impractical and a constitutional overstretch. The White House says Trump and Witkoff have done nothing wrong. “Despite dishonest claims from Democrats, there are no conflicts of interest,” deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said in a written statement. “Special Envoy Steve Witkoff is divesting from all of his assets, including WLF, and has no operational role in the company. These types of baseless accusations only serve to distract from all his incredible work in service to the country.” The same goes for Trump, she said. “The president’s assets are in a trust managed by his children” – a back-handed acknowledgement that Trump, unlike many of his recent predecessors, has neither divested nor placed his assets in a blind trust. “There are no conflicts of interest,” she repeated. But “no conflicts of interest” doesn’t square with the facts. World Liberty is openly using its association with the president to generate profit for the Trump and Witkoff families. Senator Murphy dismissed the White House’s defense as “absurd on its face”. “Everybody can see what’s going on,” he said. As for Witkoff’s day job – negotiating peace in Gaza, ending the war in Ukraine, and cutting a deal with Iran – it doesn’t appear to be going especially well. In Gaza, Witkoff helped to close Biden’s ceasefire deal in January by making the point that Trump wanted it, and by making sure Netanyahu got – briefly – on board. But he’s failed at several attempts to extend or renew the ceasefire. He won freedom for one Israeli-American hostage by going around Netanyahu, but not the 20 Israeli hostages who are still believed alive; he’s trying to negotiate another temporary ceasefire that would free about half of the captives. He and Trump appear to have misjudged how stubborn Netanyahu would be in his desire to continue the war. In Ukraine, Witkoff tried to win Putin’s confidence by pre-emptively endorsing some of Russia’s main demands, including its claim to five Ukrainian regions including Crimea. That hasn’t been enough; Putin still appears intent on pursuing his goal of controlling all of Ukraine. In a two-hour telephone call on 19 May, Trump tried to jawbone Putin into embracing a ceasefire, but the Russian leader merely agreed to hold more talks – during which he intends to continue the war. On Iran, Witkoff initially stumbled by publicly softening US policy, saying Iran could maintain a uranium enrichment program as long as it didn’t move toward weapons capability. After a storm of protest from US hardliners, he backed off and returned to the demand that Iran dismantle its entire enrichment program. Trump has given the US-Iranian negotiations a deadline of mid-June, but that’s unlikely to be enough to reach a result. Then secretary of state John Kerry needed 20 months to negotiate the 2015 agreement that Trump scrapped, and that was after years of preparatory work. What’s gone wrong? The answer from many foreign policy professionals is that Witkoff, a real-estate developer with no previous diplomatic experience, is in over his head. “He knows nothing about Russia, he knows nothing about Ukraine, he knows nothing about Iran, he knows nothing about nuclear weapons,” said John Bolton, who served as national security adviser for 18 months during Trump’s first term. “What could go wrong?” Witkoff readily acknowledges that he was naive when he started. “Of course I didn’t understand the dimensions of it,” he said of the Gaza conflict. “Now I do.” Witkoff says he’s fully devoted to his peacemaking mission and considers it more important than anything he accomplished in his real estate career. “The work is so worthy,” he told the Atlantic. Trump has long derided US diplomats as lousy negotiators and extolled entrepreneurs as master dealmakers. This month, at a belated swearing-in ceremony for Witkoff, Trump awarded his friend the highest compliment in his business-world lexicon: “He’s a killer.” Witkoff told the Atlantic that he’s been boning up on traditional diplomacy by reading books and watching Netflix documentaries. “I watched a ton of stuff on Henry Kissinger,” he said. But Kissinger never tried to negotiate three complex deals at the same time. Kissinger’s negotiations to withdraw US troops from Vietnam lasted more than three years. His talks to reopen US relations with China took more than a year. His disengagement agreements between Israel and Egypt took about 20 months. Witkoff has been on the job for only four months – six if you count his time as Trump’s pre-inaugural Gaza envoy. And he’s working for a president whose foreign policy decisions often appear erratic. So landing the Nobel peace prize, as Kissinger did, is likely to be a tall order. But Trump and Witkoff will have at least one consolation: By the end of Trump’s term, their families will be a lot richer.",

    "title": "Carbon footprint of Israel’s war on Gaza exceeds that of many entire countries",
    "article_text": "The carbon footprint of the first 15 months of Israel’s war on Gaza will be greater than the annual planet-warming emissions of a hundred individual countries, exacerbating the global climate emergency on top of the huge civilian death toll, new research reveals. A study shared exclusivelywith the Guardian found the long-term climate cost of destroying, clearing and rebuilding Gaza could top 31m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e). This is more thanthe combined 2023 annualgreenhouse gases emitted by Costa Rica and Estonia, yet there is no obligation for states to report military emissions to the UN climate body. Israel’s relentless bombardment, blockade and refusal to comply with international court rulings has underscored the asymmetry of each side’s war machine, as well as almost unconditional military, energy and diplomatic support Israel enjoys from allies including the US and UK. Hamas bunker fuel and rockets account for about 3,000 tonnes of CO2e, the equivalent of just 0.2% of the total direct conflict emissions, while 50% were generated by the supply and use of weapons, tanks and other ordnance by the Israeli military (IDF), the study found. Burning fossil fuels is causing climate chaos, with increasingly deadly and destructive extreme weather events forcing record numbers of people to migrate. The Gulf region is among the most vulnerable to extreme weather and slow-onset climate disasters including drought, desertification, extreme heat and erratic rainfall, as well as environmental degradation, food insecurity and water shortages. The research, published by the Social Science Research Network, is part of a growing movement to hold states and businesses accountable for the climate and environmental costs of war and occupation, including the long-term impact damage to land, food and water sources, as well as post-conflict clean-up and reconstruction. It is the third and most comprehensive analysis by a team of UK and US-based researchers into the climate cost of the first 15 months of conflict in which more than 53,000 Palestinians have been killed, in addition to widespread infrastructure damage and environmental catastrophe. It also provides the first, albeit partial, snapshot of the carbon cost of Israel’s other recent regional conflicts. Overall, researchers estimate that the long-term climate cost of Israel’s military destruction inGaza– and recent military exchanges with Yemen, Iran and Lebanon – is equivalent to charging 2.6bn smartphones or running 84 gas power plants for a year. This figure includes the estimated 557,359 tCO2e arising from the occupation-era construction of Hamas’s network of tunnels and Israel’s “iron wall” barrier. The killing and environmental destruction of Gaza resumed when Israel unilaterally violated the ceasefire after just two months, but the findings could eventually help calculate claims for reparations. “This updated research evidences the urgency to stop the escalating atrocities, and make sure that Israel and all states comply with international law, including the decisions from the ICC and the ICJ,” said Astrid Puentes, UN special rapporteur on the human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment. “Whether or not States agree on calling it a genocide, what we are facing is severely impacting all life in Gaza, and also threatening human rights in the region, and even globally, due to the aggravation of climate change.” The study, currently under peer review by the journal One Earth, found: Over 99% of the almost 1.89m tCO2e estimated to have been generated between the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack and the temporary ceasefire in January 2025 is attributed to Israel’s aerial bombardment and ground invasion of Gaza. Almost 30% of greenhouse gases generated in that period came from the US sending 50,000 tonnes of weapons and other military supplies to Israel, mostly on cargo planes and ships from stockpiles in Europe. Another 20% is attributed to Israeli aircraft reconnaissance and bombing missions, tanks and fuel from other military vehicles, as well as CO2 generated by manufacturing and exploding the bombs and artillery. Solar had generated as much as a quarter of Gaza’s electricity, representing one of the world’s highest shares, but most panels, and the territory’s only power plant, have been damaged or destroyed. Gaza’s limited access to electricity now mostly relies on diesel-guzzling generators that emitted just over 130,000 tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, or 7% of the total conflict emissions. More than 40% of the total emissions were generated by the estimated 70,000 aid trucks Israel allowed into the Gaza Strip – which the UN has condemned as grossly insufficient to meet the basic humanitarian needs of 2.2m displaced and starving Palestinians. But the most significant climate cost will come from rebuilding Gaza, which Israel has reduced to an estimated 60m tonnes of toxic rubble. The carbon cost of trucking out debris and then rebuilding 436,000 apartments, 700 schools, mosques, clinics, government offices and other buildings, as well as 5km of Gaza’s roads, will generate an estimated 29.4m tonnes eCO2. This is on a par with the entire 2023 emissions generated by Afghanistan. The reconstruction figure islower than previous estimates by the same research groupdue to a revision in the average size of apartment blocks. “This report is a staggering and sobering reminder of the ecological and environmental cost of Israel’s genocidal campaign on the planet and its besieged people,” saidZena Agha, policy analystfor Palestinian policy network Al-Shabaka. “But this is also the US, UK and EU’s war, all of which have provided seemingly limitless military resources to enable Israel to devastate the most densely populated place on the planet. This brings home the destabilising [regional] impact of the Israeli settler state and its inseparability from the western military-industrial complex.” The war on Gaza has also provoked bloody regional tensions. The study found: The Houthis in Yemen launched an estimated 400 rockets into Israel between October 2023 and January 2025, generating about 55 tCO2e. Israel’s aerial response generated almost 50 times more planet warming greenhouse gases. Aprevious studyfound that shipping emissions rose by an estimated 63% after the Houthis blocked the Red Sea corridor, forcing cargo ships to take longer routes. A conservative estimate of emissions from two large-scale exchanges of missiles between Israel and Iran topped 5,000 tCO2e, with more than 80% down to Israel. In Lebanon, more than 90% of the estimated 3,747 tCO2e generated by sporadic exchanges came from IDF bombs, with only 8% linked to Hezbollah rockets. The carbon cost of reconstructing 3,600 homes destroyed in southern Lebanon is almost as high as the annual emissions from the island of St Lucia. The study is based on evolving methodology known as a scope 3+ framework which seeks to capture direct and indirect wartime emissions currently missing from global climate and conflict audits. This can include soil degradation, fires, infrastructure damage, displacement of people, aid, rerouting cargo ships and civil aviation. Researchers relied on open-source information, media reports, and data from independent aid groups such as UN agencies. The true environmental costs are almost certainly higher given Israel’s media blockade, with data on razed farmland, desertification, remediation, and fires among other carbon-intense impacts hard to obtain. “This conflict in Gaza shows that the numbers are substantial, greater than the entire greenhouse gas emissions of many entire countries, and must be included for accurate climate change and mitigation targets,” said Frederick Otu-Larbi, co-author, senior teaching associate at Lancaster Environment Centre and lecturer at University of Energy and Natural Resources in Ghana. “Militaries need to reckon with the fact that their own national security and operational capacity is being compromised due to a changing climate of their own making,” said Ben Neimark, senior lecturer at Queen Mary University of London and study co-author. Previous research has found that military emissions rise with spending and buildup. Israel’s military budget surged in 2024 to $46.5bn – the largest increase in the world,according to theStockholm International Peace Research Institute. Based on one methodology, Israel’s baseline military emissions last year – excluding direct conflict and reconstruction climate costs – rose to 6.5m tCO2e. This is more than the entire carbon footprint of Eritrea, a country of 3.5 million people. Yet under current UN rules, reporting military emission data is voluntary and limited to fuel use, despite the fact the climate cost of the destruction of Gaza will be felt globally. The IDF, like most militaries worldwide, has never reported emission figures to the UN. Hadeel Ikhmais, head of the climate change office at the Palestinian Environmental Quality Authority, said: “Wars not only kill people but also release toxic chemicals, destroy infrastructure, pollute soil, air and water resources and accelerate climate and environmental disasters. War also destroys climate adaptation and hinders environmental management. Not counting carbon emissions is a black hole in accountability that allows governments to get away from their environmental crimes.”",

    "title": "Growing geopolitical uncertainty casts shadow over UK defence review",
    "article_text": "Britain may not be at war, but the backdrop to next Monday’s strategic defence review is the greatest geopolitical uncertainty since 1945. A set of loosely interconnected conflicts – led by Russia’s continued assault on Ukraine and its related shadow war in Europe, and Israel’s seemingly unending war on Hamas, which may lead to an attack on Iran – have not at all been restrained by a skittish White House with little interest in helping to promote peace in Europe. One of the three-strong review team is Fiona Hill, who was briefly and famously an adviser to Donald Trump in his first term. She is so worried about the disintegration of postwar norms that she believes the world is drifting towards a “scenario that you had in world war one” where, in the run-up to the war, “suddenly all these different interests and these different conflicts became, you know, basically intertwined with each other, [and] it becomes extraordinarily hard to disentangle”. Solving problems like these is likely to be beyond the ability of the 130-page document, jointly written by Hill, George Robertson, a former Nato secretary general, and Richard Barrons, a retired British army general. But its remit has been helped by the fact that difficult decisions about which equipment programmes to invest in and to cut have been deferred to a separate command paper in the autumn. Meanwhile, headline budgets to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027 have already been announced by the prime minister, in February. “What I’m expecting is that it’s basically going to be an essay,” said Lawrence Friedman, a military strategy expert and emeritus professor at King’s College London. Even so, the defence review has been rewritten several times since it was first completed in the spring, partly as a result of drafting battles across Whitehall. Another document – a national security strategy from Keir Starmer’s national security adviser, Jonathan Powell – is due out in June. In the past, defence reviews have done a poor job of prediction. Boris’s Johnson’s 2021 integrated review, published in the aftermath of Brexit, emphasised a British tilt to the far-off Indo-Pacific, supported by occasional flag-flying visits from the Royal Navy’s two new aircraft carriers that cost £6.2bn. But with Britain pouring more than £3bn a year of arms into Ukraine, the last review’s goal to have a “greater and more persistent presence” than any other European country in the Indo-Pacific looks irrelevant. This review’s principal task is likely to be descriptive, though it runs into two difficulties: people and money.Statistics out this weekshow again that more people are leaving the military than joining. Army numbers are at a 300-year low of 70,860, down 2.3% over the past year, despite the backdrop of the war in Ukraine. The numbers of RAF and naval personnel have fallen by similar proportions, meaning that, according to one naval source, the navy can crew only four of its six Type 45 destroyers. The news flow around service life is dominated by stories about rape, sexual harassment and sexism across the military. Internal reviews over the last two years acknowledged misogyny and misconduct in theRed Arrowsand thesubmarine service. In an inquest into the death of 19-year-oldGunner Jaysley Beckin February, the court found she killed herself after being assaulted and subsequently subjected to unwanted sexual attention. Itprompted an outpouring of reportson online forums and social media from mostly female soldiers describing similar negative experiences. A commitment will be made in the defence review to invest a further £1.5bn in military accommodation, including urgent renovation for the 1,000 worst homes, a longstanding source of complaint. But in recent years the British military has had relatively few positive stories to tell, not least because it has been relatively inactive on operations, with the fraught rescue from Kabul in August 2021 the most significant recent effort. It was followed by the smaller airlift of 2,450 Britons and other western nationals from Sudan in the spring of 2023 as a civil war broke out. Although Labour promised a modest increase in defence spending in February, amounting to £5.3bn a year in real terms when the increase from the current 2.33% of GDP to the promised 2.5% goes through, theMinistry of Defence(MoD) has an extraordinary capacity to soak up money. A former senior insider estimated that the MoD faced £5bn of cost pressures for next year, partly as a consequence of higher pay settlements announced by Labour, such as this year’s 4.5%. There remains £16.9bn of unfunded commitments in the MoD’s 10-year equipment plan. Spending on nuclear weapons is rising sharply: analysis by Steve Barwick, of Rethinking Security, concluded that the forecast cost of MoD’s Defence Nuclear Organisation’s 10-year equipment plan increased by 62% to £99.5bn in 2023. The most recent figure, for 2025, was more than £100bn, according to the MoD. At the same time, the challenge of maintaining the UK’s ageing fleet of Vanguard submarines, which carry the Trident nuclear armed missiles, means individual patrol boats are undertaking record missions underwater, the last of which was 204 days long – more than nine months. A more immediate problem for the British military is how to resource and sustain a commitment to participate in a European-led “reassurance force” for Ukraine, currently promised in the event of a durable ceasefire, if Russia can be persuaded to agree. A British contribution might amount to a brigade of a few thousand, as well as some command and control functions, though finding the troop numbers is likely to be a stretch, suggesting there will be more calls for extra spending. “To be credible, the defence review needs to be backed by a cast-iron commitment to take defence spending to 3% of GDP by a specific date and 3.5% by 2035,” argued Peter Ricketts, a former national security adviser. But while no extra money is expected immediately, the financial debate may be moved forward not by the review but by Nato and Trump by the end of the month. Alliance members are considering a proposal from Mark Rutte, Nato’s secretary general, to be tabled at its June summit in The Hague, to increase core defence spending to 3.5% by 2032, with a further 1.5% on cyber and transport and other military-related infrastructure. That would match Trump’s demand that Nato members spend 5% of GDP on defence. “I assume that in The Hague we will agree on a high defence spend target of in total 5%,” Rutte said this week.",

    "article_text": "Donald Trumpsays he is firing the first female director of theNational Portrait Gallery, which contained a caption that referenced the attack on the US Capitol that his supporters carried out in early 2021. The president announced the termination on Friday in aposton his social media platform that accused Sajet – born in Nigeria, raised in Australia and a citizen of the Netherlands – of being “a strong supporter” of diversity initiatives that his administration opposes as well as “highly partisan”. He cited no evidence for either claim. Legal experts, including Eric Columbus, a former litigator for the January 6 select committee,suggestedTrump does not have the power to fire Sajet, since the gallery is part of the Smithsonian, which is not run by the executive branch. In its collection of portraits of American presidents, the gallery had this text about Trump: “Impeached twice, on charges of abuse of power and incitement of insurrection after supporters attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, he was acquitted by the Senate in both trials. After losing to Joe Biden in 2020, Trump mounted a historic comeback in the 2024 election. He is the only president aside from Grover Cleveland (1837-1908) to have won a nonconsecutive second term.” Sajet arrived in the US with her family in 1997, held positions at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and the Historical Society of Pennsylvania andwas appointed directorof the National Portrait Gallery in 2013,according to a Guardian profile of her. The National Portrait Gallery is an art museum in Washington DC that opened in 1968 and is part of theSmithsonian Institution. It boasts the only complete collection of presidential portraits outside the White House. After beginning his second presidency in January, Trump issuedan executive orderdirecting the removal of “improper, divisive or anti-American ideology” from the institution’s storied museums. Sajet had said the gallery under her leadership tried “very hard to be even-handed when we talk about people and that’s the key”. “Everyone has an opinion about American presidents, good, bad and indifferent,” Sajet said. “We hear it all, but generally I think we’ve done pretty well.”",

    "title": "Trump praises Elon Musk for ‘colossal change’ as Doge adviser says farewell",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump saw Elon Musk off from the White House on Friday, as the Tesla chief concluded his more than four months leading the so-called department of government efficiency’s disruptive foray into federal departments that achieved far fewer cost savings than expected. Standing alongside Trump in the Oval Office, Musk, who faced a 130-day limit in his tenure as a special government employee thathad ended two days prior, vowed that his departure “is not the end” of Doge. “The Doge team will only grow stronger over time. The Doge influence will only grow stronger. I liken it to a sort of person of Buddhism – it’s like a way of life,” he said. Trump was effusive in his praise of the world’s richest man, saying Musk “delivered a colossal change in the old ways of doing business in Washington” and calling Doge “the most sweeping and consequential government reform program in generations”. The president presented Musk with a golden key to the White House to mark his service. “He willingly accepted the outrageous abuse and slander and lies and attacks, because he does love our country. I know that very much,” Trump said. Their joint appearance came hours afterthe New York Times publisheda story detailing Musk’s use of ketamine, ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms while campaigning for Trump last year. In the Oval Office, Musk wore a black cap and suit jacket over a T-shirt, while also sporting a bruise around his right eye he said was caused by his young son punching him while they were “horsing around”. Conceived on the campaign trail not long after Musk endorsed Trump’s bid to return to the White House, Doge wasestablished by an executive orderthe president signed hours after being sworn in. Its staffers, many who are young and have ties to Musk but little to no government service, then fanned out across federal agencies, cancelling out budget items and directing the terminations of employees. An initial goal to cut $2tn in government spending became $1tn by the time Trump was sworn in – nonetheless a hefty sum that the president characterized as a necessary component of his promised “golden age” of lower taxes, leaner government and stricter immigration enforcement. Labor unions and Democrats protested against Doge’s mass firings and warned that its unorthodox efforts to coax federal workers out of their jobs and gather information about their work would undermine government operations. The initiative made its presence known via emails that became infamous, such as the “fork in the road” deferred resignation offerings, or a short-lived demand that staff across departmentssubmit a detailed listof their accomplishments. Doge had a hand in the firings of thousands of probationary workers and the dismantling of US Agency for International Development (USAID), both actions sparking court challenges. As the initiative picked up steam in February, Musk appeared at a prominent conservative conference wielding a chainsaw that he declared “is for bureaucracy!” Yet the aggressive pace of cost-cutting sparked blunders, such as when the administrationscrambled to hire backprobationary employees let go from the agency overseeing nuclear weapons. Vandals motivated by antipathy towards Musk begantargeting Tesla vehicles and dealerships, and reports emerged that his romp through the federal government has enraged Trump’s newly confirmed cabinet secretaries. Doge’s public-facing website detailing its cuts became known for errors, but currently says it has only saved $175bn – much less than Musk’s goal. “We do expect to achieve over time the trillion dollars of savings,” Musk said in the Oval Office. “Say, by the middle of next year, with the support of the president and Congress, could we achieve a trillion dollars of savings? I think so. We’re on track to do so.” Republicans in Congress are expected to attempt to codify Doge’s cuts when they consider appropriations bills as part of the next federal fiscal year’s budget. As for Musk, he said he would “continue to be visiting here and be a friend and adviser to the president”.",

    "article_text": "Authorities investigating the apparent drugging death and robbery of a Telemundo reporter who was covering February’s Super Bowl have arrested a third suspect inthe case. On Friday, the Kenner police department in Louisiana announced the arrest of 33-year-old Christian Anderson on allegations that he had a role in the death of Adan Manzano, 27, whose body was found on 5 February in his hotel room in the city just west ofNew Orleans. Policeallegedthat Anderson “played an active role in a coordinated pattern of targeting victims, drugging them and stealing personal property including phones and financial account access”, the Louisiana news station WBRZ reported. Anderson’s arrest follows that of Danette Colbert, 48, and Rickey White, 34, in Manzano’s death. Colbert was charged with second-degree murder while White was arrested on robbery and fraud charges stemming from Manzano’s death. In a statement, Kenner police said that a car used by Colbert on the day of Manzano’s death had been rented under Anderson’s name. Police also said that additional evidence showed Anderson “provided logistical support, engaged in post-crime communication, and assisted in attempts to financially benefit from the victim’s stolen assets”, including Manzano’s credit card. Sign up toHeadlines US Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion After his arrest, Anderson was booked on counts including principal to simple robbery, purse snatching, access device fraud, illegal transmission of monetary funds, bank fraud and computer fraud. He was being held at the jail in Jefferson parish,Louisiana, which includes Kenner, alongside Colbert and White, according to lockup records. Manzano, a reporter based in Kansas City, Missouri, was found suffocated while lying face down on a pillow. Autopsy reports revealed that Manzano – who was in New Orleans to cover the Kansas City Chiefs football team’s participation in the 9 February Super Bowl – had alcohol and the depressant Xanax in his system. Later investigations showed that Colbert had been captured on security footage leaving Manzano’s hotel room. In May, Colbert wassentencedto 25 years in prison in an unrelated case that involved non-fatal drugging and robbery charges. “The evidence was overwhelming that this woman was a serial fraudster and took advantage of multiple tourists and innocent people over many years in the French Quarter” neighborhood in New Orleans, where she first met Manzano, Louisiana attorney general Liz Murrillsaid.",

    "title": "PBS sues Trump for stripping its funds",
    "article_text": "PBS has filed a lawsuit against United States President Donald Trump and other administration officials to block his order stripping federal funding from the 330-station public television system, three days afterNPR did the samefor its radio network. In its lawsuit filed on Friday, PBS relied on similar arguments, saying Trump was overstepping his authority and engaging in “viewpoint discrimination” because of his claim that PBS’s news coverage is biassed against conservatives. “PBS disputes those charged assertions in the strongest possible terms,” lawyer Z W Julius Chen wrote in the suit, filed in US District Court in Washington, DC. “But regardless of any policy disagreements over the role of public television, our Constitution and laws forbid the President from serving as the arbiter of the content of PBS’s programming, including by attempting to defund PBS.” It was the latest of many legal actions taken against the administration for its moves, including several by media organisations impacted by Trump’s orders. PBS was joined as a plaintiff by one of its stations, Lakeland PBS, which serves rural areas in northern and central Minnesota. Trump’s order is an “existential threat” to the station, the lawsuit said. A PBS spokesman said that “after careful deliberation, PBS reached the conclusion that it was necessary to take legal action to safeguard public television’s editorial independence, and to protect the autonomy of PBS member stations”. Through anexecutive order earlier this month, Trump told the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and federal agencies to stop funding the two systems. Through the corporation alone, PBS is receiving $325m this year, most of which goes directly to individual stations. The White House deputy press secretary, Harrison Fields, said the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is creating media to support a particular political party on the taxpayers’ dime. “Therefore, the President is exercising his lawful authority to limit funding to NPR and PBS,” Fields said. “The President was elected with a mandate to ensure efficient use of taxpayer dollars, and he will continue to use his lawful authority to achieve that objective.” PBS, which makes much of the programming used by the stations, said it gets 22 percent of its revenue directly from the feds. Sixty-one percent of PBS’s budget is funded through individual station dues, and the stations raise the bulk of that money through the government. Trump’s order “would have profound impacts on the ability of PBS and PBS member stations to provide a rich tapestry of programming to all Americans”, Chen wrote. PBS said the US Department of Education has cancelled a $78m grant to the system for educational programming, used to make children’s shows like Sesame Street, Clifford the Big Red Dog and Reading Rainbow. For Minnesota residents, the order threatens the Lakeland Learns education programme and Lakeland News, described in the lawsuit as the only television programme in the region providing local news, weather and sports. Besides Trump, the lawsuit names other administration officials as defendants, including Education Secretary Linda McMahon, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. PBS says its technology is used as a backup for the nationwide wireless emergency alert system. The administration hasfought with several media organisations. Government-run news services like Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty are struggling for their lives.The Associated Press has battled with the White Houseover press access, and the Federal Communications Commission is investigating television news divisions.",

    "title": "Abused, exploited: How two Africans became trapped in a cyber-scam in Laos",
    "article_text": "Bokeo province, Laos– Khobby was living in Dubai last year when he received an intriguing message about a well-paying job working online in a far-flung corner of Southeast Asia. The salary was good, he was told. He would be working on computers in an office. The company would even foot the bill for his relocation to join the firm in Laos – a country of 7.6 million people nestled between China, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Myanmar. With the company paying for his flights, Khobby decided to take the plunge. But his landing in Laos was anything but smooth. Khobby discovered that the promised dream job was rapidly becoming a nightmare when his Ghanaian passport was taken on arrival by his new employers. With his passport confiscated and threats of physical harm ever present, he endured months working inside a compound which he could not leave. The 21-year-old had become the latest victim ofbooming online cyber-scam operationsin Southeast Asia – an industry that is believed to have enslaved tens of thousands of workers lured with the promise of decently paid jobs in online sales and the information technology industry. “When I got there, I saw a lot of Africans in the office, with a lot of phones,” Khobby told Al Jazeera, recounting his arrival in Laos. “Each person had 10 phones, 15 phones. That was when I realised this was ascamming job,” he said. The operation Khobby found himself working for was in a remote area in northwest Laos, where a casino city has been carved out of a patch of jungle in the infamous “Golden Triangle” region – the lawless border zone between Myanmar, Laos and Thailand that has long been a centre for global drug production and trafficking. He said he was forced to work long days and sleep in a dormitory with five other African workers at night during the months he spent at the scam centre in the Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone. Khobby recounted the original message he received from an acquaintance encouraging him to take the job in Laos. “My company is hiring new staff”, he said, adding that he was told the salary was $1,200 per month. “He told me it was data entry.” The Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone (GTSEZ) where Khobby was lured to for work operates as an autonomous territory within Laos. Leased from Laotian authorities by Chinese nationalZhao Wei, whom the US government has designated the leader of a transnational criminal organisation, life in the GTSEZ is monitored by a myriad of security cameras and protected by its own private security force. Clocks are set to Beijing time. Signage is predominantly in Chinese, and China’s yuan is the dominant and preferred currency. Central to the GTSEZ city-state is Zhao Wei’sKings Romans casino, which the United States Treasury also described as a hub for criminal activity such as money laundering, narcotics and wildlife trafficking. During a recent visit to the zone by Al Jazeera, Rolls Royce limousines ferried gamblers to some of the city’s casinos while workers toiled on the construction of an elaborate and expansive Venice-style waterway just a stone’s throw from the Mekong river. While luxury construction projects – including the recently completed Bokeo International Airport – speak to the vast amounts of money flowing through this mini casino city, it is inside the grey, nondescript tower blocks dotted around the economic zone where the lucrative online scam trade occurs. Within these tower blocks, thousands oftrafficked workersfrom all over the world – just like Khobby – are reported to spend up to 17 hours a day working online to dupe unsuspecting “clients” into parting with their money. The online swindles are as varied as investing money in fake business portfolios to paying false tax bills that appear very real and from trading phoney cryptocurrency to being caught in online romance traps. Anti-trafficking experts say most of the workers are deceived into leaving their home countries – such are nearby China, Thailand and Indonesia or as far away as Nigeria, Ghana, Uganda and Ethiopia – with the promise of decent salaries. Khobby told how his “data entry” job was, in fact, a scam known in the cybercrime underworld as “pig butchering”. This is where victims are identified, cold-called or messaged directly by phone in a bid to establish a relationship. Trust is built up over time to the point where an initial investment is made by the intended victim. This can be, at first, a small amount of the victim’s money or emotions in the case of fake online relationships. There are small rewards on the investments, Khobby explained, telling how those in the industry refer to their victims as pigs who are being “fattened” by trust built up with the scammers. That fattening continues until a substantial monetary investment is made in whatever scam the victim has become part of. Then they are swiftly “butchered”, which is when the scammers get away with the ill-gotten gains taken from their victims. Once the butchering is done, all communications are cut with the victims and the scammers disappear without leaving a digital trace. According to experts, cyber-scamming inside the GTSEZ boomed during the 2019 and 2020 COVID lockdowns when restrictions on travel meant international visitors could not access the Kings Romans casino. In the years since, the cyber-scam industry has burgeoned, physically transcended borders to become one of the dominant profit-making illicit activities in the region, not only in the GTSEZ in Laos but also in neighbouring Cambodiaand in conflict-ridden Myanmar. Though not as elaborate as the GTSEZ, purpose-built cyber-scam “compounds” have proliferated in Myanmar’s border areas with Thailand. The Center for Strategic and International Studies estimates that cyber-scamming in Southeast Asia generates tens of billions annually, while the United States Institute of Peace equates the threat to that of the destructive fentanyl trade. “Cyber-scam operations have significantly benefitted from developments in the fintech industry, including cryptocurrencies, with apps being directly developed for use at [cyber-scam] compounds to launder money,” said Kristina Amerhauser, of the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime. “Victims and perpetrators are spread across different countries, money is laundered offshore, operations are global,” Amerhauser told Al Jazeera, explaining that the sophisticated technology used in cyber-scamming, along with its international reach, has made it extremely difficult to combat. About 260 trafficked scam-centre workers were recently rescued in a cross-border operation between Thailand and Myanmar. Yet, even in rare instances such as this when trafficked workers are freed, they still face complications due to their visa status and their own potential complicity in criminal activity. Khobby – who is now back in Dubai – told Al Jazeera that while he was coerced into working in the GTSEZ, he did actually receive the promised $1,200 monthly salary, and he had even signed a six-month “contract” with the Chinese bosses who ran the operation. Richard Horsey, International Crisis Group’s senior adviser on Myanmar, said Khobby’s experience reflected a changing trend in recruitment by the criminal organisations running the scam centres. “Some of the more sophisticated gangs are getting out of the human trafficking game and starting to trick workers to come,” Horsey said. “People don’t like to answer an advert for criminal scamming, and it’s hard to advertise that. But once they’re there, it’s like – actually, we will pay you. We may have taken your passport, but there is a route to quite a lucrative opportunity here and we will give you a small part of that,” he said. The issue of salaries paid to coerced and enslaved workers complicates efforts to repatriate trafficking victims, who may be considered complicit criminals due to their status as “paid” workers in the scam centres, said Eric Heintz, from the US-based anti-trafficking organisation International Justice Mission (IJM). “We know of individuals being paid for the first few months they were inside, but then it tapers off to the point where they are making little – if any – money,” Heintz said, describing how victims become “trapped in this cycle of abuse unable to leave the compound”. “This specific aspect was a challenge early on with the victim identity process – when an official would ask if an individual previously in the scam compound was paid, the victim would answer that initially he or she was. That was enough for some officials to not identify them as victims,” Heintz said. Some workers have also been sold between criminal organisations and moved across borders to other scam centres, he said. “We have heard of people being moved from a compound in one country to one in another – for example from Myawaddy to the GTSEZ or Cambodia and vice versa,” he said. Khobby said many of the workers in his “office” had already had experience with scamming in other compounds and in other countries. “Most of them had experience. They knew the job already,” he said. “This job is going on in a lot of places – Thailand, Laos, Myanmar. They were OK because they got paid. They had experience and they knew what they were doing,” he added. High-school graduate Jojo said she was working as a maid in Kampala, Uganda, when she received a message on the Telegram messaging app about an opportunity in Asia that involved being sponsored to do computer studies as part of a job in IT. “I was so excited,” Jojo recounted, “I told my mum about the offer.” Jojo told how she was sent an airline ticket, and described how multiple people met her along the way as she journeyed from Kampala to Laos. Eventually Jojo arrived in the same scam operation as Khobby. She described an atmosphere similar to a fast-paced sales centre, with Chinese bosses shouting encouragement when a victim had been ‘butchered’ and their money stolen, telling how she witnessed people scammed for as much as $200,000. “They would shout a lot, in Chinese – ‘What are we here for? Money!’” On top of adrenaline, the scam operation also ran on fear, Jojo said. Workers were beaten if they did not meet targets for swindling money. Mostly locked inside the building where she worked and lived; Jojo said she was only able to leave the scam operation once in the four months she was in the GTSEZ, and that was to attend a local hospital after falling ill. Fear of the Chinese bosses who ran the operation not only permeated their workstations but in the dormitory where they slept. “They told us ‘Whatever happens in the room, we are listening’,” she said, also telling how her co-workers were beaten when they failed to meet targets. “They stopped them from working. They stopped them from coming to get food. They were not getting results. They were not bringing in the money they wanted. So they saw them as useless,” she said. “They were torturing them every day.” Khobby and Jojo said they were moved to act in case it was their turn next. When they organised a strike to demand better treatment, their bosses brought in Laotian police and several of the strikers – including Jojo and Khobby – were taken to a police station where they were told they were sacked. They were also told they would not be paid what was owed in wages and their overseers refused to give their passports back. Khobby said he was left stranded without a passport and the police refused to help. “This is not about only the Chinese people,” Khobby said. “Even in Vientiane, they have immigration offices who are involved. They are the ones giving the visas. When I got to Laos, it was the immigration officer who was waiting for me. I didn’t even fill out any form,” he said. With help from the Ghanaian embassy, Khobby and Jojo were eventually able to retrieve their passports, and with assistance from family and friends, they returned home. The IJM’s Heintz, said that target countries for scammer recruitment – such as those in Africa – need better awareness of the dangers of trafficking. “There needs to be better awareness at the source country level of the dangers associated with these jobs,” he said. Reflecting on what led him to work up the courage to lead a strike in the scam centre, Khobby considered his childhood back in Ghana. “I was a boy who was raised in a police station. My grandpa was a police commander. So in that aspect, I’m very bold, I have that courage. I like giving things a try and I like taking risks,” he said. Jojo told Al Jazeera how she continues to chat online with friends who are still trapped in scam centres in Laos, and who have told her that new recruits arrive each day in the GTSEZ. Her friends want to get out of the scam business and the economic zone in Laos. But it is not so easy to leave, Jojo said. “They don’t have their passports,” she said.",

    "title": "UEFA Champions League final: PSG and Inter Milan ‘motivated’ and ‘happy’",
    "article_text": "Billions of dollars have been spent. Some of the world’s greatest players have come and gone. Yet the Champions League trophy has remained agonisingly out of reach for Paris Saint-Germain. That could be about to change. The Qatari-owned team is one game away from European club football’s most prestigious prize, with Inter Milan standing in the way inSaturday’s final in Munich. “The motivation for me is to win the Champions League title for the first time for PSG,” coach Luis Enrique said on Friday. “That is the gift I want to give the people, the club, the city.” PSG is the favourite, with a thrilling young team that has produced stunning performances to get past Manchester City, Liverpool andArsenal. It feels like its time has finally come. But Inter is a wily opponent that is in its second final in three seasons and cut down a rampant Barcelona in an epic semifinal —winning 7-6 on aggregate. “Our opponent, we hold the utmost respect for,” Inter captain Lautaro Martinez said. “But with the weapons we’ve got, we want to hit them where it hurts.” The warning signs are there for PSG. PSG’s run to the final has justified a shift in direction from the bling culture of superstar signings to focus more on young French talent. Owned by Qatar Sports Investments since 2011, PSG signed some of the biggest names in football, including Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Kylian Mbappe, Neymar and Lionel Messi without ever getting its hands on the trophy it craves most of all. Messi, Neymar and Mbappe have all gone, and without those iconic figures, PSG looks a more complete team. “It’s about being a team, not a group of individuals,” PSG captain Marquinhos said. “I’m in love with this team. It’s a delight to be part of the squad.” PSG’s transformation has still come at some cost. Players like Ousmane Dembele, Desire Doue and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia were signed for an estimated $240m combined in a squad assembled at spectacular expense. Meanwhile, Inter has been savvy in the market — signing older players and picking up free agents to put together a team that has reached two Champions League finals in three years —losing to Man City in 2023— and won an Italian title in that time. PSG’s only previous final was in 2020, a 1-0 loss to Bayern Munich. It was a semifinalist in 2021 and 2024. Elimination in the round of 16 in 2022 and 2023 preceded the decision by President Nasser Al-Khelaifi to change his transfer strategy. This year is only the second time since 2011 that three-time champion Inter has advanced beyond the round of 16. Inter last won the Champions League in 2010 under Jose Mourinho. Dembele has been one of the outstanding players in Europe this season with 30 goals in all competitions for PSG, including a run of 24 in 18 games from December to March. Kvaratskhelia was signed from Napoli in January and sparked a turnaround in PSG’s fortunes in the Champions League when it looked in danger of being eliminated at the league stage. The Georgian forward was long considered one of the brightest talents in Europe before making the move and has added another dimension to an already thrilling PSG attack. Midfielders Vitinha and Joao Neves are the engine, hungrily hunting down the ball when out of possession and springing attacks with the speed of their passing. World Cup winner Lautaro Martinez is Inter’s standout player and became the club’s all-time leading scorer in the Champions League this season. “I’ve won big trophies, but I’m missing the Champions League. I’m happy to be in another final. We want to have the perfect game and bring the trophy back to Milan,” the Argentinian forward said. Defender Denzel Dumfries played a huge role in beating Barcelona with two goals in the first leg at the Nou Camp and goalkeeper Yann Sommer pulled off a string of saves to keep Inter in the tie in the second leg. A Champions League winner with Barcelona in 2015, Luis Enrique has won 12 major trophies in spells with the Catalan club and PSG. If his club, the French champions, triumph on Saturday, he would become the seventh coach to win the Champions League or European Cup with two different teams. The list includes Carlo Ancelotti, Pep Guardiola and Mourinho. Victory would come 10 years after his previous title. “I have peace of mind. I’ve got 10 years more experience since the last time,” Luis Enrique said. “It’s a wonderful opportunity to play in a final and make history.” Inter’s Simone Inzaghi is hoping to win his first Champions League title at the second time of asking after the defeat to City two years ago. Then, as now, Inter was the underdog, and came close to upsetting Guardiola’s all-conquering City. “Matches don’t come down to wage bills or turnover, it’s the players on the pitch,” Inzaghi said. “We were huge underdogs two years ago and went toe to toe. “I dreamt of playing the Champions League final. I didn’t do it as a player, but thanks to this group of players, I’ve been in two finals as a head coach.” Inzaghi cannot match Enrique’s trophy count but has impressed at Inter where he won Serie A last year, and alongside two Italian Cups, it was his third overall. Only a week ago, Intersurrendered the Serie A titleby one point.",

    "article_text": "Israel has struck western Syria, the Israeli military and Syrian state media have reported, in the first such aerial attack on the country in almost a month, the day after the United States envoy to Damascus said conflict between the neighbouring countries is “solvable”. Syrian state media reported late Friday that one person was killed and three others injured by an Israeli air strike on the coastal city of Latakia. The SANA news agency said earlier that the Israeli military targeted three sites in the countryside of the Latakia and Tartous governorates. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also reported that jets likely to be Israeli struck military sites on the outskirts of Tartous and Latakia, on the Mediterranean coast. The Israeli strike follows Syria acknowledgingindirect talks with Israelearlier this month to calm tensions. The Israeli military claimed responsibility for the strike, saying it had “struck weapon storage facilities containing coastal missiles that posed a threat to international and Israeli maritime freedom of navigation, in the Latakia area of Syria”. “In addition, components of surface-to-air missiles were struck in the area of Latakia,” it said, adding that it would “continue to operate to maintain freedom of action in the region, in order to carry out its missions and will act to remove any threat to the State of Israel and its citizens”. The Israeli strike came a day afterUS envoy to Syria Thomas Barrack’s visit to Damascusaimed at rebuilding ties under Syria’s new administration, during which he said the conflict between Israel and Syria is “solvable” and needed to start with “dialogue”. “I’d say we need to start with just a non-aggression agreement, talk about boundaries and borders,” Barrack told journalists on Thursday. The two countries have technically been at war since the first Arab-Israeli war in 1948. A state of heightened tension and deep enmity between Israel and Syria accelerated during the 1967 war, which also drew in Egypt and Jordan, and Israel’s subsequent occupation of the Syrian Golan Heights. Israel has carried out frequent attacks in Syria both during the Bashar al-Assad rule and since his ouster. Shortly before the fall of al-Assad’s regime, Israel seized more Syrian territory near the border, claiming it was concerned about President Ahmed al-Sharaa’s interim administration, which it has dismissed as “jihadist”. During a meeting between US President Donald Trump and al-Sharaa in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, earlier in May, the US leader urged al-Sharaa to normalise relations with Israel. While al-Sharaa has not commented on possible normalisation with Israel, he has stated his support for returning to the terms of a 1974 ceasefire agreement that created a United Nations buffer zone in the Golan Heights.",

    "title": "UN says famine stalks all in Gaza; Israel shoots, wounds aid seekers",
    "article_text": "Gaza is the “hungriest place on Earth”, the United Nations has said, as Israel continues to block all but a trickle of humanitarian aid from entering the Strip, where famine stalks the entire Palestinian population, and the Israeli military relentlessly bombs the besieged enclave. Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), said on Friday that 100 percent of the 2.3-million population of Gaza is now on the verge of “catastrophic hunger”. The “limited number of truckloads coming in [Gaza] is a trickle – it’s drip-feeding food,” Laerk said. “The aid operation that we have ready to roll is being put in an operational straitjacket that makes it one of the most obstructed aid operations not only in the world today, but in recent history”, he added. What paucity of aid is entering the enclave is under the control of a new, shadowy NGO backed by Israel and the United States – theGaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). On Friday, sources at Gaza hospitals told Al Jazeera that 20 people were shot by Israeli troops as they desperately tried to get food at a GHF aid distribution point. That distribution site, located near Israel’s Netzarim Corridor bisecting the territory, is the third to have been set up, after two distribution points were established in the southern city of Rafah. Armed surveillance is administered around the clock. “People are telling us that the sites managed and operated by the GHF are metres away from where the Israeli military is stationed. They can see the tanks, they can see the armoured vehicles,” said Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Gaza City. Ten people were killed earlier this week trying toaccess food distribution points, and images showed many being herded into cage-like lines. Palestinians doing all they can to get hold of any aid for their families must risk Israeli fire and military forces. “There are also reports of enforced disappearances. A lot of families reported that many of their children, of their family members, who went to the sites … have gone missing as they were trying to get food,” Mahmoud said. The aid delivery scheme has been roundly condemned by UN officials and the humanitarian community, who have accused the group of aiding Israel’s war objectives by forcibly displacing Palestinians under the guise of aid. Critics maintain that the currently inadequate aid could be safely scaled up in Gaza, if Israel would allow access to aid and let the organisations that have decades of experience handle the flow. “Through this dangerous and reckless approach, food is not being distributed where it’s needed most but is instead directed only to areas where Israeli forces choose to amass civilians,” said Doctors Without Borders Secretary-General Christopher Lockyear. “This means the most vulnerable – especially the elderly and people with disabilities – have virtually no chance of accessing the food they desperately need.” Famine is declared in an area where at least 20 percent of households face an extreme lack of food. At famine levels of deprivation, 30 percent of children suffer from acute malnutrition, and at least four children in every 10,000 die each day from starvation or malnutrition-linked disease. OCHA said at least 1 in 5 people in Gaza is currently facing starvation. Michael Fakhri, the UN special rapporteur on the right to food, says it’s “safe to say there is famine” in Gaza. Fakhri told Al Jazeera that Israel is using aid “as bait to corral people” and push them out of the north and into militarised zones”. The humanitarian situation in Gaza was already catastrophic when Israel imposed a total blockade on March 2, causing conditions to deteriorate even further. After growing international pressure, Israeli authorities said they would allow minimal supplies of food and medicine into the Strip, but critical supplies are still not reaching the people. The chorus of condemnation against Israel was underscored by France’s President Emmanuel Macron on Friday. The French leader warned that Paris could “apply sanctions” unless the Israeli government responds to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Speaking during a visit to Singapore on Friday, Macron said the international community could not remain passive while Palestinians in Gaza face a deepening hunger crisis that is “untenable”. “If there is no response in the coming hours and days in line with the humanitarian situation, we will have to harden our collective position,” he added, suggesting that France may consider applying sanctions against Israeli settlers. At least 30 people have been killed since dawn on Friday in attacks in southern Deir el-Balah, northern Jabalia and on eastern Khan Younis. The Israeli army has also been expanding its military operation on the ground, issuing new forced displacement orders for five areas in northern Gaza. According to a UN spokesperson, nearly 200,000 people have been displaced in Gaza in the last two weeks by Israel’s displacement orders. Meanwhile, hopes for an elusive truce remained unrealised. Hamas said on Friday it iscurrently reviewinga new US ceasefire proposal that Washington says has been signed off on by Israel, but that in its current form will only result in “the continuation of killing and famine” in Gaza. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Thursday that Israel had “signed off” on the ceasefire proposal, and the Trump administration’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, had submitted it to Hamas for consideration. Trump said he believes his administration will have an announcement later on Friday, “or maybe tomorrow”. “We have a chance of that,” he told reporters from the Oval Office. The details of the new proposal have not been made public, but senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told the news agency Reuters that, crucially, it did not contain commitments from Israel to end its war on Gaza, withdraw from the enclave, or allow aid to freelyenter the war-torn territory.",

    "title": "‘Not really leaving’: Trump bids goodbye to Elon Musk at White House event",
    "article_text": "United States President Donald Trump has bid goodbye to Elon Musk at a White House event marking the billionaire’sdeparturefrom his role in government. Speaking from the Oval Office on Friday, Trump showered Musk with praise for his work as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an initiative to reduce federal bureaucracy and spending. “ I just want to say that Elon has worked tirelessly helping lead the most sweeping and consequential government reform programme in generations,” Trump said. He credited Musk with delivering “a colossal change in the old ways of doing business in Washington” and called Musk’s service “without comparison in modern history”. Still, the president also assured reporters that DOGE would continue its work even after Musk is gone. “With Elon’s guidance, [DOGE is] helping to detect fraud, slash waste and modernise broken and outdated systems,” Trump said. The joint appearance comes as the two men seek to downplay reports of a growing rift, particularly after MuskcriticisedTrump’s signature budget bill on CBS News. It also coincides with the publication of a New York Times report alleging that Musk has struggled with increasing drug use and personal turmoil behind the scenes. Musk declined to comment on the Times report during his Oval Office appearance. He also avoided remarking on speculation that his departure was connected to tumbling sales at hiscar company, Tesla. Instead, he pointed out that, as a special government employee, he cannot work in the Trump administration for a period exceeding 130 days without facing stricter disclosure and ethics requirements. He also focused on promoting his work with DOGE and criticising those on the political left who would impede Trump’s agenda. “This is not the end of DOGE, but really at the beginning,” Musk said, clad in a black T-shirt emblazoned with the phrase “The Dogefather”, written in the style of the gangster film The Godfather. “The DOGE team will only grow stronger over time.” Trump, meanwhile, emphasised that his relationship with the billionaire – a prominent backer of his 2024 re-election campaign – would continue. “Elon’s really not leaving. He’s going to be back and forth, I think,” Trump said. Despite White House claims about its efficacy, the extent of DOGE’s cost-savings has remained foggy. As of Friday, the panel claimed it had achieved an estimated $175bn in savings, made up of “asset sales, contract/lease cancellations and renegotiations, fraud and improper payment deletion, grant cancellations, interest savings, programmatic changes, regulatory savings, and workforce reductions”. But DOGE’s transparency and methodology have been repeatedly questioned. The only accounting made available to the public adds up to less than half of the claimed figure. Ananalysispublished on Friday by the news agency Reuters also suggests the actual sum is much lower. Using US Treasury summaries, Reuters found that only $19bn in federal spending had been cut, though it noted that some savings may require more time to be reflected in the Treasury Department’s data. Regardless, all of those figures fall far short of the goal of $2 trillion saved that Musk initially set out to achieve. When asked about the discrepancy on Friday, Musk maintained that $1 trillion in savings remained a long-term goal. “I’m confident that over time, we’ll see a trillion dollars of savings, a reduction – a trillion dollars of waste and fraud reduction,” he said. But critics have questioned if DOGE will continue with the same verve following Musk’s departure. Musk and DOGE have long been lightning rods for public criticism, as they implemented sweeping changes to the federal government. Since Trump started his second term as president in January, organisations like the US Agency for International Development (USAID) have seen their funding cut and their staffing slashed. As a result, employees, contractors, labour groups and state officials have sued to block DOGE’s efforts, with varying levels of success. Behind the scenes, there have also been reports that Musk clashed with members of Trump’s cabinet, who may seek relief from cuts to their departments after Musk’s exit. Musk’s foray into government has caused blowback for his companies as well, with protests at Tesla dealerships spreading across the country. Profits plunged 71 percent at Tesla in the first three months of the year, with shareholders calling for Musk to return to work. When asked by a reporter if Musk’s time in government was “worth it”, he was circumspect. He explained that he felt DOGE had become seen as a “boogeyman”, blamed for any effort to overhaul the federal government. But he reaffirmed his commitment to being a “friend and adviser to the president” and said the experience was worthwhile. “I think it was. I think [it] was an important thing,” he added. “I think it was a necessary thing, and I think it will have a good effect in the future.”",

    "title": "Pakistan beat Bangladesh by 57 runs to lead T20I cricket series",
    "article_text": "Pakistan beat Bangladesh by 57 runs in the second T20 international in Lahore to seal the three-game series 2-0. Opener Sahibzada Farhan was named Player of the Match after he top scored with 74 for the hosts, who won the toss at Gaddafi Stadium before posting 201-6. It was a fair fight back from Bangladesh to restrict the hosts after Hasan Nawaz recorded the best strike rate of the innings with an unbeaten 51 off 26 balls. Tanzim Hasan gave some respectability to the chase, which was reduced to 77-7, when, coming in at nine, the Bangladesh bowling allrounder added 50 off 31 balls. Abrar Ahmed’s off-break spin was key to restricting the tourists as he claimed 3-19 off his four overs to help Pakistan to their first T20 home series win since December 2021. “It feels very good … I didn’t know it was three and a half years,” the Pakistan captain Salman Agha said afterwards of the end of the barren run. “It was a complete performance, and that is way better than anything else. “Everyone is loving the team environment where everyone can come and enjoy playing for Pakistan.” Pakistan, whowon the first match by 37 runsat the same venue, brought in opener Sahibzada in place of Fakhar Zaman. The decision was fully repaid with six sixes and four fours recorded by the right-hander in his 41-ball innings. The match could not have got off to a worse start for Bangladesh with Shoriful Islam limping out of his first bowl. The left-arm seamer appeared to tweak a groin while fielding the ball in his follow-through and adds to a long list of absent pacers for the tourists. “When Shoriful was injured, the momentum shifted,” the Bangladesh skipper Litton Das said. “We have a lack of bowling, but we came back well because I would back our batters any day to chase 200 on this track. “Whoever is batting well has to keep going, for 13 or 14 overs, but after four overs we didn’t bat well and there were back-to-back wickets. “In cricket, you have to do the basics, we don’t do it at the moment.” Bangladesh had reached 44-0 in the fourth over of the chase before the collapse that ended their hopes of bouncing back from the opening defeat. Opener Tanzid Hasan struck 33 from 19 balls in the stand, but once he fell to the seam of Faheem Ashraf an inevitable end quickly formed. The last match is on Sunday, also in Lahore.",

    "title": "US government investigates attempt to impersonate Trump’s chief of staff",
    "article_text": "The United States government has opened an investigation into apparent efforts to impersonate White House chief of staff Susie Wiles in communications to politicians. On Friday, a White House official confirmed to The Associated Press that a probe had been opened, following a report about the impersonation in The Wall Street Journal a day prior. Anonymous sources told The Journal that governors, business leaders and senators had received messages and phone calls from someone posing as Wiles, who is aclose associateof President Donald Trump. Some recipients told the newspaper that the calls even appeared to replicate Wiles’s voice usingartificial intelligence. The giveaway, according to The Wall Street Journal, came when the messages asked about items Wiles should know or did not sound like her in other ways. For example, the newspaper reported that some messages were either too formal or had poor grammar. The phone number used was also not Wiles’s normal number. Still, some of the sources who spoke to The Journal said they interacted with the impostor before realising it was not, in fact, Wiles herself. On Friday, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Kash Patel, issued a statement denouncing any impersonation campaigns. “Safeguarding our administration officials’ ability to securely communicate to accomplish the president’s mission is a top priority,” said Patel. Earlier this month, the bureau had acknowledged that “malicious actors” appeared to be mimicking government officials through a “text and voice messaging campaign”. In Wiles’s case, sources close to the chief of staff told The Wall Street Journal that someone had hacked into her personal mobile phone, thereby accessing her contacts. A longtime Republican consultant, Wiles has her political roots in Florida, where she first served as chief of staff to a Republican mayor in the city of Jacksonville. She has since risen to higher echelons in the political sphere, helping to manage the gubernatorial campaign of Republican leader Rick Scott and later serving in a similar role in two of Trump’s presidential bids. In 2016, she led operations in Florida for Trump’s first successful election campaign, and in 2024, she served as his national campaign manager. Two days after his re-election victory, on November 7, Trumpannounced Wileswould be accompanying him to the White House as his chief of staff, a role that oversees daily activities for the president. The chief of staff also coordinates policy development and supervises White House staff. While the FBI has yet to confirm how Wiles’s personal contacts got into the hands of her impersonator, US media has noted that Trump’s presidential campaign announced in August 2024 that it had been hacked by Iran and that sensitive documents were stolen.",

    "title": "US gov’t and Google face off in search monopoly case",
    "article_text": "Google has been back in federal court to fend off the United States Department of Justice’s attempt to topple its internet empire at the same time it is navigating a pivotal shift to artificial intelligence (AI) that could undercut its power. On Friday, the legal and technological threats facing Google were among the key issues being dissected during the closing arguments of a legal proceeding that will determine the changes imposed upon the company in the wake of its dominant search engine being declared an illegal monopoly by US District Judge Amit Mehta last year. Brandishing evidence presented during a recent three-week stretch of hearings, Justice Department lawyers are attempting to persuade Mehta to order a radical shake-up that includes a ban on Google paying to lock its search engine in as the default on smart devices and an order requiring the company to sell its Chrome browser. Google lawyers say only minor concessions are needed, especially as the upheaval triggered by advances in artificial intelligence already are reshaping the search landscape, as alternative, conversational search options are rolling out from AI startups that are hoping to use the Department of Justice’s four-and-half-year-old case to gain the upper hand in the next technological frontier. Mehta used Friday’s hearing to ask probing and pointed questions to lawyers for both sides while hinting that he was seeking a middle ground between the two camps’ proposed remedies. “We’re not looking to kneecap Google,” the judge said, adding that the goal was to “kickstart” competitors’ ability to challenge the search giant’s dominance. After the daylong closing arguments, Mehta will spend much of the next several months mulling a decision that he plans to issue before Labor Day in the US (September 1). Google has already promised to appeal the ruling that branded its search engine as a monopoly, a step it cannot take until the judge orders a remedy. While both sides of this showdown agree that AI is an inflection point for the industry’s future, they have disparate views on how the shift will affect Google. The Justice Department contends that AI technology by itself will not rein in Google’s power, arguing additional legal restraints must be slapped on a search engine that’s the main reason its parent company, Alphabet Inc, is valued at $2 trillion. Mehta indicated in court Friday that he was still undecided on how much AI’s potential to shake up the search market should be incorporated in his forthcoming ruling. “This is what I’ve been struggling with,” Mehta said early in the hearing. Justice prosecutor David Dahlquist urged the judge to issue forward-thinking remedies that would “pry open” the search market to competition and not allow Google to use its search monopoly to unfairly benefit itself in the AI race. Google has already been deploying AI to transform its search engine into an answer engine, an effort that has so far helped maintain its perch as the internet’s main gateway despite inroads being made by alternatives from the likes of OpenAI and Perplexity. The Justice Department contends a divestiture of the Chrome browser that Google CEO Sundar Pichai helped build nearly 20 years ago would be among the most effective countermeasures against Google continuing to amass massive volumes of browser traffic and personal data that could be leveraged to retain its dominance in the AI era. Executives from both OpenAI and Perplexity testified last month that they would be eager bidders for the Chrome browser if Mehta orders its sale. Google’s lawyer John Schmidtlein said on Friday that AI companies should “get to work” on their own products rather than try to persuade the court to give them unfair access to Google’s innovations. The debate over Google’s fate also has pulled in opinions from Apple, mobile app developers, legal scholars and startups. Apple, which collects more than $20bn annually to make Google the default search engine on the iPhone and its other devices, filed briefs arguing against the Justice Department’s proposed 10-year ban on such lucrative lock-in agreements. Apple told the judge that prohibiting the contracts would deprive the company of money that it funnels into its own research, and that the ban might make Google even more powerful because the company would be able to hold onto its money while consumers would end up choosing its search engine anyway. The Cupertino, California, company also told the judge a ban would not compel it to build its own search engine to compete against Google. In other filings, a group of legal scholars said the Justice Department’s proposed divestiture of Chrome would be an improper penalty that would inject unwarranted government interference in a company’s business. Meanwhile, former Federal Trade Commission officials James Cooper and Andrew Stivers warned that another proposal, which would require Google to share its data with rival search engines, “does not account for the expectations users have developed over time regarding the privacy, security, and stewardship” of their personal information. The App Association, a group that represents mostly small software developers, also advised Mehta not to adopt the Justice Department’s proposed changes because of the ripple effects they would have across the tech industry. Hobbling Google in the way the Justice Department envisions would make it more difficult for startups to realise their goal of being acquired, the App Association wrote. “Developers will be overcome by uncertainty” if Google is torn apart, the group argues.",

    "title": "Supreme Court allows Trump to revoke humanitarian parole for 530,000",
    "article_text": "The conservative-dominated United States Supreme Court has handed President Donald Trump another major victory, allowing his administration torevokea temporary legal status from more than 500,000 immigrants as legal challenges continue in lower courts. Friday’s decision applies to hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan, Cuban, Haitian and Nicaraguan people who were granted humanitarian parole under the administration of former President Joe Biden. That parole status allowed them to enter the US due to emergencies or urgent humanitarian reasons, including instability, violence and political repression in their home countries. But the Supreme Court’s ruling means that the beneficiaries of humanitarian parole could be targeted for deportation prior to a final ruling on whether the revocation of their immigration status is legal. The ruling by the top court, which is dominated six-to-three by conservatives, reverses a lower court’s order temporarily halting the Trump administration from yanking humanitarian parole from Venezuelans, Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans. The Supreme Court’s decision was unsigned and did not provide reasoning. However, two liberal justices on the panel publicly dissented. The outcome “undervalues the devastating consequences of allowing the government to precipitously upend the lives and livelihoods of nearly half a million noncitizens while their legal claims are pending”, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote. She noted that some of the affected individuals had indicated in court filings that they would face grave harm if their humanitarian parole were cut short. Trump has targeted programmes like humanitarian parole as part of his efforts tolimit immigrationinto the US. His administration has accused Biden of “broad abuse” in his invocation of humanitarian parole: Trump has said Biden was lax on immigration and oversaw an “invasion” of the US from abroad. Since taking office in January, Trump’s administration has also indefinitely suspended applications for asylum and other forms of immigration relief. The plaintiffs in Friday’s humanitarian parole case warned the Supreme Court they could face life-threatening conditions if they were not allowed to seek other avenues for immigration and were forced to leave the country. If they were deported “to the same despotic and unstable countries from which they fled”, lawyers for the plaintiffs argued that “many will face serious risks of danger, persecution and even death”. Earlier in May, the Supreme Court also allowed Trump toendTemporary Protected Status (TPS) — another temporary immigration pathway — for about 350,000 Venezuelans living in the US. TPS allows non-citizens to remain in the US while circumstances in their home countries remain unsafe or unstable. As with Friday’s case, the Supreme Court’s ruling on TPS allowed the Trump administration to move forward with removals while a legal challenge to Trump’s policy plays out in lower courts. Biden had encouraged the use of programmes like TPS and humanitarian parole as alternatives to undocumented immigration into the US. Humanitarian parole, for instance, allowed recipients to legally live and work in the US for two years. Trump’s efforts to end the programme would cut that timeframe short. The countries in question — Nicaragua, Venezuela, Cuba and Haiti — have all experienced significant economic and political crises in recent years. In Venezuela, for instance, critics have accused President Nicolas Maduro of detaining and disappearing political dissidents and activists, and an economic collapse caused hyperinflation that put basic necessities beyond the means of many Venezuelans. Millions have fled the country in recent years. One of the other countries, Haiti, has been ravaged by a spike in gang violence since the assassination of President Jovenal Moise in 2021. Federal elections have not been held since, and gangs have used violence to fill the power vacuum. As much as90 percentof the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, has fallen under gang control, according to the United Nations, and thousands have been killed.",

    "article_text": "Pakistan has announced it will designate an ambassador to Afghanistan, the first since the Taliban re-entered andcaptured Kabul in 2021, in a move aimed at improving previously strained relations between the neighbouring countries. In a statement on Friday, Pakistani Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan have improved since his visit to Kabul in April. “To maintain this momentum, I am pleased to announce the decision of the Government of Pakistan to upgrade the level of its charge d’affaires in Kabul to the level of ambassador,” he said. Dar’s announcement comes a week after he met his Afghan counterpart, Amir Khan Muttaqi, alongside their Chinese counterpart Wang Yi duringa trilateral meeting in Beijing. Dar expressed hope that the decision would strengthen economic cooperation, boost bilateral trade and enhance joint efforts to combat terrorism. Pakistan-Afghanistan relations are on positive trajectory after my very productive visit to Kabul with Pakistan delegation on 19th April 2025. To maintain this momentum, I am pleased to announce the decision of the Government of Pakistan to upgrade the level of its Chargé… — Ishaq Dar (@MIshaqDar50)May 30, 2025 Tensions between the two countries have long been strained over Pakistan’s accusations that Kabul provides a haven to the Pakistan Taliban, who are known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan or TTP and are allies of the Afghan Taliban. TTP is a separate group and has been emboldened since the Afghan Taliban returned to power four years ago. There was no immediate comment from Kabul on the latest development. However, Pakistan had earlier signalled that the two sides were considering an upgrade in diplomatic relations. Another critical dynamic is the presence of Afghan refugees and migrants in Pakistan. Islamabad has ramped up forced mass deportation, with some tens of thousands having crossed the border, in April, back to an uncertain future in Afghanistan, the United Nations International Organization for Migration (IOM) reported. Nearly three million Afghansin Pakistan, many who have been there for decades as wars plagued their nation, face deportation after Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif announced in October a three-phase plan to send them back to their home country. Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban currently have embassies in each other’s capitals, but they are led by charges d’affaires, a lower level than an ambassador. Pakistan has become the fourth country to designate an ambassador to Kabul, after China, the United Arab Emirates and Uzbekistan. No country has formally recognised the Taliban administration, with foreign powers saying they will not do so until it changes course on women’s rights. Diplomats and experts say, however, that having an ambassador officially present their credentials represents a step towards recognition of the Taliban’s government.",

    "title": "OpenAI wants ChatGPT to be a ‘super assistant’ for every part of your life",
    "article_text": "An internal strategy document lays out OpenAI’s ambition to build “your interface to the internet.” An internal strategy document lays out OpenAI’s ambition to build “your interface to the internet.” byAlex Heath If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Thanks to the legal discovery process, Google’s antitrust trial with the Department of Justice has provided a fascinating glimpse into the future of ChatGPT. An internal OpenAIstrategy documenttitled “ChatGPT: H1 2025 Strategy” describes the company’s aspiration to build an “AI super assistant that deeply understands you and is your interface to the internet.” Although the document is heavily redacted in parts, it reveals that OpenAI aims for ChatGPT to soon develop into much more than a chatbot. “In the first half of next year, we’ll start evolving ChatGPT into a super-assistant: one that knows you, understands what you care about, and helps with any task that a smart, trustworthy, emotionally intelligent person with a computer could do,” reads the document from late 2024. “The timing is right. Models like 02 and 03 are finally smart enough to reliably perform agentic tasks, tools like computer use can boost ChatGPT’s ability to take action, and interaction paradigms like multimodality and generative UI allow both ChatGPT and users to express themselves in the best way for the task.” The document goes on to describe a “super assistant” as “an intelligent entity with T-shaped skills” for both widely applicable and niche tasks. “The broad part is all about making life easier: answering a question, finding a home, contacting a lawyer, joining a gym, planning vacations, buying gifts, managing calendars, keeping track of todos, sending emails.” It mentions coding as an early example of a more niche task. Even when reading around the redactions, it’s clear that OpenAI sees hardware as essential to its future, and that it wants people to think of ChatGPT as not just a tool, but a companion. This tracks withSam Altmanrecently sayingthat young people are using ChatGPT like a “ life advisor.” “Today, ChatGPT is in our lives through existing form factors — our website, phone, and desktop apps,”another partof the strategy document reads. “But our vision for ChatGPT is to help you with all of your life, no matter where you are. At home, it should help answer questions, play music, and suggest recipes. On the go, it should help you get to places, find the best restaurants, or catch up with friends. At work, it should help you take meeting notes, or prepare for the big presentation. And on solo walks, it should help you reflect and wind down.” At the same time, OpenAI finds itself in a wobbly position. Its infrastructure isn’t able to handle ChatGPT’s rising usage, which explains Altman’s focus on building data centers. In a section of the document describing AI chatbot competition, the company writes that “we are leading here, but we can’t rest,” and that “growth and revenue won’t line up forever.” It acknowledges that there are “powerful incumbents who will leverage their distribution to advantage their own products,” and states that OpenAI will advocate for regulation that requires other platforms to allow people to set ChatGPT as the default assistant. (Coincidentally, Apple is rumored to soon let iOS users also select Google’s Gemini for Siri queries. Meta AI just hit one billion users as well, thanks mostly to its many hooks in Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook.) “We have what we need to win: one of the fastest-growing products of all time, a category-defining brand, a research lead (reasoning, multimodal), a compute lead, a world-class research team, and an increasing number of effective people with agency who are motivated to ship,” the OpenAI document states. “We don’t rely on ads, giving us flexibility on what to build. Our culture values speed, bold moves, and self-disruption. Maintaining these advantages is hard work but, if we do, they will last for a while.” “The way we do ranking is sacrosanct to us.” - Google CEOSundar PichaionDecoder, explaining why the company’s search results won’t be changed for President Trump or anyone else. “Compared to previous technology changes, I’m a little bit more worried about the labor impact… Yes, people will adapt, but they may not adapt fast enough.” - Anthropic CEODario AmodeionCNNraising the alarm about the technology he is developing. “Meta is a very different company than it was nine years ago when they fired me.” - Anduril founderPalmer LuckeytellingAshlee Vancewhy he is linking up withMark Zuckerbergto make headsets for the military.

    "title": "Young people sue Donald Trump over climate change",
    "article_text": "A new lawsuit says Trump’s executive orders boosting fossil fuels are ‘unconstitutional.’ A new lawsuit says Trump’s executive orders boosting fossil fuels are ‘unconstitutional.’ byJustine Calma A group of young people — as young as 7 and as old as 25 — aresuingthe Trump administration to stop itsassault on renewable energyand climate action. Executive orders President Donald Trump signed to promote fossil fuels amount to an “unconstitutional” overreach of power, they allege in acomplaintfiled Thursday at a US District Court in Montana. The 22 plaintiffs also claim that by increasing pollution and denying climate science, the president’s actions violate their Fifth Amendment rights to life and liberty. It’s the latest high-profile case brought against governments by youth concerned about how fossil fuel pollution and climate change poses risks to their health and ability to thrive as they grow up. Two brothers, aged 11 and 7, “were born into climate change-induced smoke seasons that did not exist for older generations” Two brothers, aged 11 and 7 and named “J.K.” and “N.K.” in the suit, “were born into climate change-induced smoke seasons that did not exist for older generations and which compromise their health,” thecomplaintsays. They grew up mostly in Montana but now live in Southern California, and the suit says wildfire smoke has encroached on their lives from state to state. J.K. was born with an abnormal mass of lung tissue and “experienced nosebleeds, sore throats, headaches, tiredness, coughing, trouble breathing, and eye irritation from wildfire smoke,” according to the suit. N.K. has “frequent” upper respiratory infections that have led to emergency room visits. They’ve both missed school days and camp because of feeling sick from smoke and soot in the air from wildfires, it says. Greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels trap heat, and rising temperatures havecontributed to longer fire seasonsin the western US.With hotter, drier conditions,the area burned by forest fires in the western USdoubled between 1984 and 2015. “Every additional ton of [greenhouse gas] pollution and increment of heat Defendants cause will cause J.K. and N.K. more days of poor air quality, more smoke, and thus, more harm to their lives, health, and safety,” the complaint adds. In recent years, scientists have been trying to better understand the long-term health impact of wildfire smoke, which previously hadn’t been studied as thoroughly as pollution from other sources thought to be more consistent problems, like factories and highways. Now, chronic exposure to wildfire smoke is agrowing concern. Wildfire smoke isconsidered a neurotoxinestimated to be more harmfulthan other common air pollutants, but its effects on the body can vary depending on what kinds of materials burn and how chemicals released by the fire interact with other substances in the atmosphere. After campaigning on a promise to “drill, baby, drill” andaccepting more than $75 millionin contributions from oil and gas interests, Trumpsigned executive orders on his first dayin office declaringa purported “national energy emergency,” directing federal agencies to“unleash” domestic fossil fuel productionand promote the use of gas-powered vehicles over EVs. He signed another executive order to“reinvigorat[e]” the coal industryin April. Coalreleases more planet-heating pollution when burnedthan other fossil fuels and hasstruggled to competewith cheaper sources of electricity. The plaintiffs are seeking injunctive relief to block implementation of those executive orders and to declare them unconstitutional. They also claim that Trump lacks the authority to erode environmental protections passed by Congress under theClean Air Act. The administration’s efforts toimpede scientific researchandremove climate informationfrom federal websitesamounts to “censorship” and denies plaintiffs access to resources they might otherwise be able to use to minimize risks they face from climate change, the suit alleges. In response to the lawsuit, White House assistant press secretary Taylor Rogers said in an email toThe Verge, “The American people are more concerned with the future generations’ economic and national security, which is why they elected President Trump in a landslide victory to restore America’s energy dominance. Future generations should not have to foot the bill of the lefts’ radical climate agenda.” The plaintiffs, who hail from Montana, Oregon, Hawai‘i, California, and Florida, are represented by the nonprofit law firm Our Children’s Trust, which has also represented young people in similar climate cases. A federal appellate court dismissed anothercasethat youth filed against the Obama administration in 2015 over fossil fuel pollution causing climate change, and the US Supreme Court ended that legal battle this year when itdeclined to hear an appeal. But there have also been some wins. A group of youthreached a settlement last yearwith the state of Hawai‘i and its Department of Transportation that commits them to a plan to reach zero greenhouse gas emissions from transportation by 2045. J.K. and N.K. were also plaintiffs in a climate suit filed against the state of Montana. Last year,Montana’s Supreme Court uphelda district judge rulingaffirming their right to a clean and healthy environmentand rejecting policies that had barred officials from considering the consequences of climate change when permitting new energy projects.

    "article_text": "Following a test run in select markets, Grindr’s social media-inspired Right Now functionality is rolling out globally. Following a test run in select markets, Grindr’s social media-inspired Right Now functionality is rolling out globally. byCharles Pulliam-Moore Grindr has always excelled at helping its users find folks looking to spend some quality time together, but the hookup app is looking to speed up the “looking?” process even more with its latest feature. Today, Grindr announced that Right Now, its social media-like live feed feature, is rolling out to all of the platform’s users followinga pilot test in select markets. Unlike Grindr’s traditional grid that shows you an array of other users’ profiles based on how far away they are, Right Now functions a bit more like X / Twitter and displays a stream of recent posts that can include both text and photos. Right Now posts disappear from the live feed after an hour, and while they don’thaveto be used for hookup purposes, posters can hit a toggle specifying whether they’re looking to host (read: have someone over for fun.) At launch, Grindr says users in certain locations “will receive a number of free hour-long Right Now sessions per week (refreshed every Friday)” meaning that the feed will only be accessible in hour-long windows. Down the line, the company also plans to make more sessions available to purchase. Ina press release about the new feature, Grindr’s chief product officer, AJ Balance, explained that Right Now was designed to help people “find exactly what they want, when they want it – without the guesswork.” “We built this intention-based feature based on feedback from our community so they can connect with like-minded people without wasting time on mismatched expectations,” Balance said. “The response to our initial March launch was so strong we accelerated the global rollout ahead of schedule because it’s clear people want this… well, right now.” Grindr is not the first app of its kind to introduce functionality clearly inspired by social media platforms. Sniffies, a more cruising-focused Grindr competitor that doesn’t require signing up for an account and allows users to post sexually explicit photos on their public profiles, has had a feature similar to Right Now for some time. But Right Now’s widespread launch is the latest phase ofGrindr’s larger plan to roll out a series of new features— many of which are powered by generative artificial intelligence — meant to boost revenue and make users see the app as “the Global Gayborhood in Your Pocket™.” Previously, Grindr introduced A-List, a tool that uses Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 3.7 model and Amazon Web Services’ Bedrock to summarize chats with the intention of helping users rekindle “meaningful past connections” and pursue “high-potential matches.”Bloombergreportsthe same platform is now underpinningGrindr’s Wingman, a generative AI assistant that can draft chat responses for users who can’t think of things to say for themselves,provide sex tips, and give suggestions about places that might make for good dates. Some of Grindr’s AI features are free to try, but for continued access to them, the company requires users to sign up for its monthly subscription plans. All of the features are part of Grindr’s effort to bring in more money and staunch the financial bleeding that came following its initial public offering in 2022. AsPlatformerreported last year, Grindr’s stock price plummeted by 70 percentfollowing its SPAC, and the company has been scrambling to establish new revenue streams amid employee unionization efforts and internal concerns that Grindr “was losing its progressive culture.” At theWall Street Journal’s Future of Everything conferencethis week, Grindr’s CEO George Arison spoke about how AI has changed his own productivity, and his desire for the company to start thinking about how the technology can be more deeply integrated into its services. “For all the new things that we build, I want them to be built as if we are an AI-native startup,” Arison said. “If you’re going to do marketing for this, great; start thinking with AI first and then go to people because that’s how I think companies are going to be built moving forward and that’s what we should be doing as a business as well.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

    "article_text": "Musk said DOGE will live on despite his departure. His DOGE-related problems are likely to persist too. Musk said DOGE will live on despite his departure. His DOGE-related problems are likely to persist too. byAndrew J. Hawkins Elon Musk appeared alongside President Trump for a press conference in the Oval Office Friday,perhaps for the last time, with a noticeable black eye that he says he got from his young son. ”I said, ‘Go ahead, punch me in the face.’ And he did,” he said. Musk is emerging fromhis five-month stint as head of DOGE, or Department of Government Efficiency, with more than just a shiner. His company, Tesla, ishemorrhaging market sharein key countries around the globe and recorded its first year-over-year quarterly sales decrease in almost five years. His reputation has plummeted,with a majority of US residents saying they dislike him. And his claims to have saved the government a trillion dollars by slashing “waste, fraud and abuse” seem to have mostly been a failure.One researchertied Musk’selimination of humanitarian aidfunding to 300,000 deaths overseas, mostly children. Musk has been feeling the blows, too. Sources in the Trump administrationtoldReutersthat the billionaire has been “exhausted and exasperated,” especially by the blowback against his companies. Tesla’s board reportedlyinitiated a search for a replacement CEO, a claim the directors have denied. But in his Oval Office visit, Musk attempted to cast his Washington adventures as largely successful. He noted that as a special government employee, he was statutorily limited to 130 days in the position. But he vowed that even while he left his perch, DOGE will continue its work. “This is not the end of DOGE, but really the beginning,” he said, wearing a t-shirt that said “The Dogefather”. “The DOGE team will only grow stronger over time. The DOGE influence will only grow stronger. I liken to a sort of Buddhism. It’s like a way of life.” “This is not the end of DOGE, but really the beginning.” Musk claimed that over time, the group would be able to achieve his stated goal of $1 trillion of funding cuts — even while falling far short of that. DOGE slashed $160 billion to date, Musk said, but expertsbelievethe real number is significantly lower. And DOGE’s legacy of firings and rehirings, its use of paid administrative leave, and the associated loss of productivity may have actually cost the government upwards of $135 billion,according to the Partnership for Public Service. After delivering a rambling introduction, Trump thanked Musk for his service and presented him with a golden key emblazoned with the White House insignia. He also cast doubt on those who are hoping that Musk would be riding off into the sunset for good. “Elon gave an incredible service. Nobody like him,” Trump said. “And he had to go through the slings and the arrows, which is a shame because he’s an incredible patriot.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

    "article_text": "Notepad is getting italic and bold styling, alongside support for hyperlinks, lists, and Markdown. Notepad is getting italic and bold styling, alongside support for hyperlinks, lists, and Markdown. byTom Warren Microsoft is adding text formatting to its Windows Notepad app. The significant Notepadupdate is availablefor Canary and Dev Channel testers on Windows 11, and introduces bold and italic styling, alongside hyperlinks and even Markdown support. The addition of text formatting in Notepad means there’s now a formatting toolbar at the top of the app, alongside the existing File, Edit, and View options. The toolbar includes access to bold, italic, and hyperlink options, but it also includes support for lists and headings. “The experience supports Markdown style input and files for users who prefer to work directly with the lightweight markup language,” explains Dave Grochocki, principal product manager lead for Microsoft’s Windows inbox apps. “You can switch between formatted Markdown and Markdown syntax views in the view menu or by selecting the toggle button in the status bar at the bottom of the window.” Since Notepad is usually used with plain text, you can also easily clear all formatting from the formatting toolbar or from the edit menu in the app. If you’re not a fan of the lightweight formatting options, you can also fully disable this new support in the Notepad app settings. This formatting addition to Notepad comes just a week after Microsoft started testing a new feature in the app thatcan generate text for you using AI. The new Write feature in Notepad can be used to “quickly draft text based on your prompt,” and alongside these formatting options Notepad is starting to look a lot more like Microsoft Word. Like I wrote inmyNotepadnewsletter earlier this week, it’s amazing that Microsoft barely touched Notepad for decades, and now it’s gone from basic log file reader to writing messages itself. A lot of Notepad’s new features have arrived since Microsoft decided toremove WordPad from Windows, after nearly 30 years.

    "article_text": "The law will require platforms to let users opt out of features linked to prolonged screen time, such as recommendation algorithms. The law will require platforms to let users opt out of features linked to prolonged screen time, such as recommendation algorithms. byEmma Roth Nebraska Governor Jim Pillenhas signed a billthat cracks down on social platforms’ features that could keep kids online for longer. Under the Age-Appropriate Online Design Code Act (LB504), major platforms must let users choose to see a chronological feed, rather than one provided by a recommendation algorithm,which experts have foundcould negatively affect children’s mental health and development. In addition to pausing potentially disruptive notifications at nighttime and during school days, platforms must offer users the option to voluntarily limit how much time they spend on the services. Online services are required to let users limit certain categories of content from getting recommended, too. The law also places several limitations on user tracking and requires platforms to apply strict privacy settings to users identified as minors by default. These settings allow platforms to only collect the “minimum” amount of data from young users, block targeted advertising,and limit the use of dark patterns. ThoughCaliforniaandMarylandhave passed similar laws, NetChoice is fighting them in court over claims they violate the First Amendment. NetChoice is a technology trade group that includes Meta, Google, Amazon, Reddit, X, Snap, and other tech giants. In February,NetChoice sued Marylandto block its Age-Appropriate Design Code Act, whilea judge sided with NetChoicein a ruling that blocked California’s version of the rule in March. Amy Bos, NetChoice’s director of state and federal affairs,wrote in a letter toGovernor Pillen that Nebraska’s design code law could impose age verification requirements “onmostwebsites available to Nebraska users, including news sites, popular blogs, and certain online retailers,” potentially posing a security risk. Bos also argues that tracking requirements conflict with existing requirements under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). NetChoice similarly believes that Nebraska’s design code law violates the First Amendment, though this particular bill doesn’t include limits on the types of content children can access. States that have more recently introduced design code laws haveoverhauled the legislation in an attempt to harden itagainst potential lawsuits from such trade groups and companies. Nebraska’s design code law goes into effect on January 1st, 2026. Companies that violate the law could face an up to $50,000 fine for each violation starting July 1st, 2026.

    "title": "The best Nintendo Switch controllers to buy right now",
    "article_text": "Our picks include pro-style controllers, Joy-Con alternatives, plus a cheap dongle for connecting Xbox/PS controllers. Our picks include pro-style controllers, Joy-Con alternatives, plus a cheap dongle for connecting Xbox/PS controllers. byQuentyn KennemerandCameron Faulkner Photography byAmelia Holowaty Krales If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. The Nintendo Switch 2 is here, but we can’t just forget about the original Switch. We’ve still got love for the console, and its many millions of owners, so we’ll keep recommending the best controllers for the Switch right here. Now, you may already know that the best Switch controllers aren’t the ones that come with the console. The removable Joy-Cons included with all non-Lite Switch consoles are convenient, given they can be detached for wireless use, but their tiny shape doesn’t do them many favors. They aren’t comfortable to hold for long gaming sessions — especially if you have large hands. In this buying guide, we’ll focus on wireless controllers that are both comfortable and reliable, as well as a few options that come with unique features designed that may match your unique play style. We’re not covering wired controllers that plug into the Switch’s dock, as they’re mostly similar to each other and don’t offer substantial savings in many cases. (PowerAandPDPmake decent ones that will do in a pinch, but they’re very basic. Unless you detest recharging your controllers, it makes more sense to go wireless.) Also, if you buy a third-party wireless controller (as in, one not made by Nintendo), it likely won’t support HD rumble, motion controls, NFC for Amiibo, or be able to turn on the Switch remotely. However, there are exceptions, which we feature below. If you’re playing your Switch while docked, it’s hard to go wrong with the officialNintendo Switch Pro Controller. It’s the only traditional gamepad that includes every feature mentioned above, and it’s one of the most satisfying controllers to use that we’ve tested. TheGuliKit KingKong 3 ProandMax, meanwhile, offer more exhaustive customization, while theHori Split Pad Prois a Joy-Con upgrade for those who prefer to play in handheld mode. Then there’s8BitDo’s PC-friendly Ultimate Bluetooth ControllerandDualShock-esque Pro 2 controller, both of which are worth checking out. The Switch Pro Controller remains tough to beat, even to this day. It offers an unmatched set of features — including motion controls, NFC, and HD rumble — and is one of the most comfy gamepads available. The Split Pad Pro is Hori’s take on the Switch Pro Controller, one that splits into two separate pieces. It’s a great Joy-Con alternative for people who primarily play their Nintendo Switch in handheld mode. The KingKong 3 Pro is a Switch controller with Xbox-like appeal. It features drift-free Hall effect sticks and triggers, removable back buttons, HD rumble support with motion controls, and so much more. The 8BitDo’s latest adapter resembles a flash drive, but once connected to your Switch’s dock, it allows you to wirelessly pair it with a variety of PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo controllers. We test Nintendo Switch controllers by playing with them with a standard grip — the same way most gamers do. We test how easy they are to connect to the Switch, as well as how reliably they stay connected. Then, we jump into a game. Since some controllers are better suited to specific genres than others, we try a variety of titles, including fighting games likeSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate, racers likeMario Kart 8 Deluxe, and shooters likeOverwatch 2. We pay attention to how everything feels — buttons, triggers, analog sticks, the D-pad — noting whether anything seems off. Does it support Bluetooth? Can you use it in wired mode? Are there alternate wireless modes, such as 2.4GHz? Ideally (but not always), a controller we recommend is compatible with other platforms, too. Do the buttons, sticks, and triggers feel good and sturdy? Does the controller have a satisfying, well-balanced weight? Does it use premium materials for the casing and grips? Any connection issues or glitches? Are there rear-facing buttons? Does it support macro settings? Can you remap buttons? Is there software support for tweaking controller settings? Does it have interchangeable buttons or sticks? Can you fine-tune vibration and sensitivity? Is it priced fairly? Are the features and quality worth the money? High quality, sturdy buildSupports HD rumble, gyro motion, and NFCLong battery lifeMobile and PC compatibility On the pricier side Supported platforms:Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV /Connectivity:Bluetooth, wired /Connector type:USB-C /Mappable rear buttons:No /Software customization:No /Rumble:Yes, HD /NFC:Yes /Motion:Yes /Power:Built-in rechargeable /Console Wakeup:Yes Ever since the Switch launched, Nintendo’s first-party Pro controller has been the best gamepad for the console. In many ways, it rivals the standard models from Sony and Microsoft in terms of comfort and build quality. And, it’s compatible with the Switch 2. Aside from the Joy-Cons, the Switch Pro Controller is the only wireless option that includes HD rumble, gyroscopic movement support, and an NFC reader for Amiibo cards and figurines. It’s one of a few controllers we’ve tested (aside from the Joy-Con and 8BitDo’s Ultimate series) that can power on the Switch without being plugged into it. The gamepad is built like a tank, and its battery life is so good that it sometimes seems like it’ll never run out. Nintendo says that it lasts around 40 hours per charge, so it’ll likely take casual gamers a long time to run down the battery. The buttons and triggers have a satisfying bounce, while its directional pad is responsive and clicky enough to satisfy retro gamers. The controller charges via USB-C, just like the Switch, and it’s compatible with a slew of other platforms you might game on, aside from Xbox and PlayStation. Given the high price, we wish that it had other features, like programmable buttons or a 3.5mm headphone jack for audio, even if wireless audio transmission from the Switch to a controller isn’t possible. If you really want the ability to listen via wired headphones without connecting your controller with a wire, you’ll need to get the Switch 2 and itsPro 2 controller. Better ergonomics than Joy-ConsAdds rear buttonsUsable as a wired controller with attachment set Lacks motion, NFC, and rumbleCan’t use wirelesslySize is clunky for travel Supported Platforms:Switch, Switch OLED /Connectivity:Wired /Connector type:Joy-Con slots /Mappable rear buttons:Yes /Software customization:No /Rumble:No /NFC:No /Motion:No /Power:via Joy-Con slots /Console Wakeup:No I’m sure there are some people who enjoy using Joy-Con controllers, but kids and small-handed folks aside, most people probably wouldn’t say they’re the most comfortable option. If you struggle with hand pain when you use the Switch, that’s where the Hori Split Pad Pro comes in. The Split Pad Pro comes in a variety of colorways, and it both looks and feels like a Switch Pro Controller that’s split in half. One half slides into each side of the Switch console like Joy-Cons, but unlike Nintendo’s default controllers, Hori’s gamepad features big, easy-to-reach buttons and generously sized triggers and analog sticks, all of which feel great in play. It also provides a lot of grip, which is particularly useful for people who need to get a better handle on the console for fast gameplay or stay comfy over longer play sessions. The Split Pad Pro doesn’t have batteries or sensors — or support for rumble, motion, IR, or NFC — so it’s completely useless when detached from the Switch. It’s only for handheld mode unless you purchase theSplit Pad Pro Attachmentseen above that turns it into a wired controller. We don’t recommend most people go that route since the attachment alone costs more than a Switch Pro Controller, which is a shame considering it doesn’t add any of the aforementioned elements (it does add a 3.5mm headphone jack, however). The company also sells theSplit Pad Compact, which is a smaller version of the Split Pad Pro that costs $50. It might be worth a look if you want something as functional as the Split Pad Pro but closer in size to a Joy-Con.

We tested them on the Nintendo Switch, PC, and mobile, but you can also use them with other Bluetooth devices, including the Steam Deck and Apple TV 4K. But there are several notable improvements and additions if you scratch deeper. They each have Hall effect dual-mode triggers (both can switch between analog and digital, but the KK3 Max exclusively adds physical trigger stops), in addition to RGB LED-surrounded Hall effect analog sticks. It should make them virtually impervious to drifting and waning responsiveness, asiFixit explains here. They each have GuliKit’s powerful magnetic vibration motors with two intensity levels and three distinct modes (including the Switch’s HD rumble). You can even customize the hot-swappable face buttons to match your preferred platform, and to the delight of tournament players, you can play with a 1,000Hz polling rate for reduced input lag on PC (wired or wireless via a dongle). Additionally, both controllers feature detachable rear-facing paddles. You get two metal moon-shaped paddles with the KK3 Pro that protrude further from the controller than the extra four you get with the KK3 Max, which are longer and curved to match the contour of the controllers’ rear grips. The latter are similar to the paddles on theXbox Elite Series 2and even borrow the same installation technique — just push them into the designated holes on the back. They require a lot more force, though they won’t easily dislodge. The longer paddles are comfortably reachable once installed, but if you have larger hands, you may need to make adjustments for the shorter variety. They only need a light tap, but since they occupy the space where your fingers usually rest, it can lead to increased misfires while gaming. You can map each back button to emulate any other button on the controller — including the rear triggers — but you can’t configure them to execute combo presses or macros. In summary, the KK3 Pro and KK3 Max offera lotfor the money. In fact, there may be no better option for interoperability and value in a single multiplatform controller right now. If we’re nitpicking, our biggest gripe is that GuliKit still hasn’t created an app to manage all of its settings more easily.

Both share Switch and Windows PC support, but 8BitDo gets a leg up with full Steam Deck compatibility. Its haptics are decent but not as good as Nintendo’s, and it’s missing Amiibo support, though it does feature customizable back paddles and motion controls — along with a hidden trick that allows you to wake a docked Switch by giving the controller a little shake. It also comes with a charging dock, which stores the 2.4GHz dongle when not in use. The included dock is handy for charging the battery. Speaking of, it typically lasts around 22 hours, which is still pretty generous but comes well short of the 40-hour mark set by Nintendo’s official controller. The Ultimate controller comes in several variants, but we recommend the Bluetooth model over the 2.4GHz or wired options for a couple of reasons. One because it’s the only version of the Ultimate that’s compatible with the Switch. Plus, it includes both 2.4GHz connectivity and GuliKit Hall effect sticks, which the 2.4GHz-only version lacks. The analog sticks offer just the right amount of resistance and sport a comfortable concave top, but they’re just a tad short on the sides. All of the buttons offer great travel, though, and the analog triggers have a satisfying amount of resistance when pulled. As for tweaks, you can customize button mapping profiles, macros, vibration intensity, and stick and trigger sensitivity using the Ultimate Software app on mobile or PC. The controller has a dedicated button that lets you swap between three profiles on the fly, plus an extra turbo button you can either reconfigure or remap. When it comes to Switch controllers, 8BitDo sets the standard for the breadth of these options and how to access them, which is another reason it’s high on our list. Nostalgic design and layoutHall effect analog sticksRemappable buttons, including back paddlesAvailable in a variety of translucent colors Lacks NFCLarger hands may feel cramped Supported Platforms:Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV, Raspberry Pi /Connectivity:Bluetooth, wired /Connector type:USB-C /Mappable rear buttons:Yes /Software customization:Yes /Rumble:Yes /NFC:No /Motion:Yes /Power:Built-in rechargeable /Console Wakeup:No The8BitDo Pro 2is another great option with Hall effect sticks for the Nintendo Switch, especially if your hands are happiest with a PlayStation-style controller layout. The Pro 2 has a comfortable grip, a crisper D-pad than the Switch Pro Controller, and two easy-to-press paddle buttons on the underside. It has rumble support (though not HD rumble) and motion control for games likeThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the KingdomandOverwatch 2, both of which allow for gyroscopic aiming. PlayStation gamers will also appreciate that the left analog stick is located toward the bottom — just like on Sony’s controllers — rather than above the D-pad as on the Switch Pro. With8BitDo’s Ultimate softwareon a mobile device or a Windows computer, you can customize the Pro 2’s button mapping and the sensitivity of its triggers and analog sticks. You can even save up to three control scheme profiles and cycle through them with a button located between the analog sticks. On its rear, there’s a switch that lets it toggle between Nintendo Switch, X-input for PC, DirectInput, and macOS modes, each with its own control customizations and Bluetooth profile. This controller offers a lot for around $40 (or slightly more if you want one of the incredibly cooltranslucent blue, purple, or greeneditions). InexpensiveAllows you to use any Bluetooth controller Requires sourcing your own controllerOnly works in docked mode There are manyotherdevicesthat allow you to use third-party controllers, but 8BitDo’s might be the best value. Instead of spending $70 on multiple Switch Pro Controllers, the$19.99 8BitDo Wireless Bluetooth USB Adapter 2lets you turn a Bluetooth controller you already own into a wireless Switch controller. It plugs into your Switch dock and supports a wide variety of models, from the latest Xbox and DualSense controllers to last-gen gamepads for the Wii and PlayStation 3. (Note: the first-gen model can’t connect to most Xbox Bluetooth controllers due to a Bluetooth incompatibility, so make sure you get the latest model.) To our surprise, the PS5 DualSense controller we tested it with worked incredibly well, with better-than-average rumble and more responsive motion controls than many dedicated Switch controllers offer. What’s more, so long as you’re using one of the newer Xbox Series X or S controllers, an Xbox One Bluetooth controller, a DualSense, a DualShock 4, or the Switch Pro Controller, you can customize their button mapping, analog stick sensitivity, and more within 8BitDo’s computer and mobile app. 8BitDo has an extensive support pagethat lists the steps required to set up your specific controller, as well as which features of those controllers it supports. That said, it’s best if you know the Switch’s button layout by heart if you plan to use either a PlayStation or Xbox controller with this adapter, as the layout on your controller will not match the on-screen prompts in games. If you already have a controller you really like and don’t mind jumping through a few small hoops to connect it, 8BitDo’s affordable adapter deserves a spot in your entertainment center. If you plan to use more than one third-party controller at a time, you’ll need an adapter for each controller (and a USB hub), but if you have a lot of controllers sitting around, it might be worth it. We like CRKD’sNitro Deckaround here. It’s a cradle-style controller that holds the Switch between a pair of Hall effect sticks, outfitting it with a standard array of face buttons, four programmable back buttons, turbo functionality, gyro motion controls, and rumble. It has passthrough charging, though not passthrough video, which would allow it to double as a dock for TV gameplay. The step-upNitro Deck Plusadds said functionality (with a USB-C to HDMI adapter), along with Bluetooth connectivity and adjustable vibration intensity / analog sensitivity. We’ve found these to be notable improvements, but we wish the passthrough solution was more elegant and that CRKD could solve the ergonomics (particularly on the right side, where the analog and button placement can cause discomfort). We recently tested theGameSir T4 Cyclone Pro($45.99) for consideration. It offers a few of the same functions as theGuliKit KingKong 3— including remappable buttons, Hall effect sticks, and two distinct macro buttons — along with dedicated vibration motors in the triggers, which is something the GuliKit doesn’t match. That said, it falls just short due to mushy-feeling buttons. GameSir considers the extra padding under the buttons a feature that makes the impact softer, but we felt it takes away from the experience. Also, although it’s perfectly usable with the Switch, the Pro’s button labeling takes after Microsoft’s, which may not be ideal for those who have trouble memorizing inputs. We also found resyncing with the Switch to be a chore after switching from a mobile device or a Windows PC. We also recently tried several wireless PowerA controllers, including theGameCube Style Wireless Controller($38.99) and a Pikachu-themed version of the standardPowerA Enhanced Wireless($44.99). We like the fun design of PowerA’s controllers, but they don’t live up to the quality of the models we recommend above, which is a shame considering some cost nearly as much. The GameCube-style wireless controller is a pretty faithful recreation of the original if you fancy a pureSuper Smash Bros.experience, but it’s barebones with no rumble, NFC, or IR. It’s an easy way to get the old-school feeling back if you don’t already have a Bluetooth-based alternative to use with 8BitDo’s USB Adapter 2. TheSwitch 2is what’s coming next. Nintendo’s new consolelaunches on June 5, and it’s both bigger and more powerful than the original model. Suffice it to say, there will be many new accessories at launch, including newJoy-Con 2 controllers, plus arefreshed Switch Pro Controllerthat features customizable rear paddles. There’s also aSwitch 2-exclusive wireless GameCube controllerreleasing that Switch Online subscribers have a chance to buy. That brings into question whether existing Switch controllers will work with the Switch 2 at all. Thankfully, Nintendo haspublished an in-depth support pageregarding the Switch 2’s compatibility (or lack of compatibility) for original (and official) Switch accessories. Good news: most of them will work just fine. They just won’t have the C button. However, compatibility with third-party products may be hit-and-miss. As for new controllers for the original Switch, we’re in a bit of a holding pattern, since most manufacturers are likely at work on Switch 2 controllers. 8BitDo has announced aSwitch-compatible Ultimate 2 controller with TMR analog sticksthat costs $69.99. There’s nothing else notable on the immediate horizon, however, and that probably won’t change until the Switch 2 arrives in June. Update, May 30th:Updated to reflect current pricing / availability. Also, we added that the Switch Pro is compatible with the Switch 2. It’s the only controller in this list that has been confirmed to work wirelessly with the new console. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

    "article_text": "The tentative contract includes provisions for wage increases and crediting procedures.﻿ The tentative contract includes provisions for wage increases and crediting procedures.﻿ byAsh Parrish The over 300 quality assurance workers of the ZeniMax Workers United-CWA union have reached a tentative contract agreement with Microsoft. It is the first contract agreement at Microsoft since the concerted effort to unionize the video game industry began roughly four years ago. “This is a monumental victory for all current video game workers and for those that come after,” said Page Branson, a senior QA tester at ZeniMax,in the press release announcing the agreement. A ratification vote for the contract will take place in late June. The union, organized by the Communications Workers of America (CWA), was formed in 2023 and was voluntarily recognized by Microsoft as a part of the company’slabor neutrality agreement with the CWA. In the two years since, the union and Microsoft engaged in contract negotiations that precipitateda one-day striketo protest return to office and outsourcing policies and, in April, astrike authorization vote. The contract details offer up a glimpse of what workers across the industry are fighting for and what they can win. According to CWA’s press release, the contract guarantees wage increases — a big deal considering QA workers are some of the lowest-paid workers in the industry. The contract will also include protections against arbitrary dismissal, as well as crediting guidelines — another big deal, as there are numerous ways a person who worked on a video gamecan get left off its credits. While the industry’s organization efforts are ongoing, there’s been a surge in activity over the last four years. Workers at Raven Software, which was then a subsidiary of Activision Blizzard before its acquisition by Microsoft,organized the first video game union at a AAA publisher in 2022. That win kicked off a series of other high-profile unionization efforts across the industry but concentrated primarily within Microsoft — ostensibly to take advantage of the labor neutrality agreement that states that Microsoft will voluntarily recognize union efforts within the company. With ZeniMax workers finally winning a contract agreement at Microsoft, the industry has another first — one that will set a precedent for future negotiations.

Swift has purchased the masters of her first six albums back from Shamrock Capital, which owned them after entertainment executive Scooter Braun sold them to the company. “All I’ve ever wanted was the opportunity to work hard enough to be able to one day purchase my music outright with no strings attached, no partnership, with full autonomy,” Swift says. “I will be forever grateful to everyone at Shamrock Capital for being the first people to ever offer this to me.” Swift says she was able to buy back the music because of the support for her re-recorded Taylor’s Versions albums and forThe Eras Tour concerts. She also now owns her music videos, concert films, album art and photography, and unreleased songs. “I can’t thank you enough for helping to reunite me with this art that I have dedicated my life to, but have never owned until now,” Swift says. Braun took ownership of the masters when he acquired The Big Machine Label Groupin 2019, which Swift at the time called her“worst case scenario.”Swift said that “for years” she had “asked” and “pleaded” for “a chance to own my work,” but Big Machine said that she could “earn” one album back for each new one she completed. Braun sold the masters to Shamrock Capital in 2020 for around $360 million, which is “relatively close” to what Swift paid to buy them back,Billboardreports. “I am happy for her,” Braun says in a statement.

Ryan Gilliam and Jeffrey Parkin are launching Big Friendly Guide. byJay Peters A lot ofPolygon’s staff was laid off following Vox Media’s sale of the publication to Valnet, but two of its former guides writers are launching their own guides-focused website:Big Friendly Guide, which you can find atbigfriendly.guide. Ryan Gilliam and Jeffrey Parkin founded and are co-owners of the site. Guides make Gilliam “feel like I’m helping someone enjoy something that’s very important to me and I know is important to them,” he tellsThe Verge. “And so when I lost the opportunity to do that at my usual 9-to-5, I wanted to continue it.” “I hate sounding immodest or bragging, but what Ryan and I got really good at was helping people play video games,” Parkin says. Their work on guides helps people have fun with games, he adds — and assists with things likegetting a giant horse inZelda. Big Friendly Guidewill make most of its content available for free, and the guides themselves won’t be paywalled. But Gilliam and Parkin will also be opening a Patreon for the site as a way for people to support the work, which will also give people access to a Discord. There will be a weekly podcast that’s free for everyone and a monthly subscriber-only podcast where Gilliam and Parkin will discuss their coverage plans. There will be ads on the site to start. “For now, at least, we’ll run ads to keep the lights on,” according to the site’sAbout Us page.) But the focus is more on building a community that trusts Gilliam and Parkin’s work and pays to support it. In addition to working on guides for games that interest them, Gilliam and Parkin want the community to make suggestions for guides that they can consider and respond to. The release ofBig Friendly Guideis just the latest outlet fromPolygonstaffers: former editor-in-chief Chris Plante launchedthePost Gamespodcastand former curation editor Pete Volk launchedthePV Guidenewsletter. The new outlets follow the rise of other indie gaming publications likeAftermathandGame File.

    "title": "Trump administration ending multiple HIV vaccine studies",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 30, 2025 / 7:37 PM EDT/ CBS News The Trump administration has moved to end funding for a broad swath of HIV vaccine research, saying current approaches are enough to counter the virus, multiple scientists and federal health officials say. Notifications that the funding would not be extended were relayed Friday to researchers, who were told byNational Institutes of Healthofficials that theDepartment of Health and Human Serviceshad elected \"to go with currently available approaches to eliminate HIV\" instead. The cuts will shutter two major HIV vaccine research efforts that were first funded by the NIHin 2012at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute and the Scripps Research Institute, multiple scientists said. A spokesperson for Moderna said the vaccine manufacturer'sclinical trialsthrough the NIH's HIV Vaccine Trials Network have also been put on pause. One senior NIH official said the HHS had also instructed the agency not to issue any more funding in the next fiscal year for HIV vaccine research, with only a small handful of exceptions. A budgetary rule change specifically targeted at HIV vaccine research is also expected to lead to another cut to the NIH's awards for studies initiated by scientists, an official said. The change, to be finalized shortly, inflates the accounting for the upfront cost of studies into HIV vaccines funded by the agency. Instead of the cost of a five-year grant being spread out over five years, the NIH plans to make HIV vaccine dollars from multi-year grants all count toward a single year, the official said, making it harder for them to get funded. A spokesperson for HHS told CBS News that \"complex and duplicative health programs have resulted in serious duplication of efforts,\" saying that \"27 separate programs that address HIV/AIDS\" had spent $7.5 billion. \"The Administration believes the United States should have the best medical research in the world. To that end, we are advancing policies to maximize the impact of every federal taxpayer dollar and ensure proper oversight of this funding,\" HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard said. Hilliard claimed \"critical HIV/AIDS programs will continue\" under the new agency that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has proposed creating, dubbed the Administration for a Healthy America. \"For HIV vaccine design and development, we've begun to see light at the end of the tunnel after many years of research. This is a terrible time to cut it off. We're beginning to get close. We're getting good results out of clinical trials,\" saidDennis Burton, an immunology professor at Scripps Research. Burton warned that their HIV vaccine research could not simply be turned back on, even if a future administration decided to change course on HIV funding. He said ongoing experiments would be shuttered, and researchers assembled to study the issue would be forced to refocus their careers on other topics. \"This is a decision with consequences that will linger. This is a setback of probably a decade for HIV vaccine research,\" Burton said. The cancellation of the funds comes weeks ahead of the Food and Drug Administration's June 19deadlinefor deciding on approval of lenacapavir, a twice-yearly injectable drug to prevent HIV. The drug, which is being brought to the commercial market by drugmaker Gilead Sciences, builds on NIH-backedresearchinto earlier HIV medications. The drug's availability could lead to a significant drop in HIV cases worldwide, sincea study foundit was 100% effective in preventing transmission. An NIH official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, rebuked the claim that the effectiveness of current HIV prevention strategies meant a vaccine was no longer needed. \"The only way of ending the HIV epidemic in the U.S. and AIDS pandemic worldwide\" is with a vaccine, they said. Developing an effective HIV vaccine has been an elusive target for researchers, though scientists have hailed recent breakthroughs in the field. \"HIV has established roadblocks to us fighting it off, which are unparalleled in vaccinology. We've had to learn what each of the roadblocks are and to devise ways to overcome it. This virus mutates so quickly,\" said Duke professor of medicine Dr. Barton Ford Haynes, who is part of the Duke Human Vaccine Institute. Haynes said their work was essentially combining multiple different vaccines as part of their approach to designing an effective HIV vaccine. He praised lenacapavir as a \"wonderful development for the field,\" but said there was still a need for a vaccine. Lenacapavir requires injections every six months to remain effective, a challenging proposition even before steep cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's domestic HIV programs and U.S.-backed HIV/AIDS foreign aid programs. \"The hope was that adding an HIV vaccine to all the preventive measures that we have would finally allow us to end the pandemic,\" Haynes said.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 30, 2025 / 7:16 PM EDT/ CBS News A bipartisan group of more than 130 retired judges filed a brief Friday urging a federal court to drop charges againstWisconsin judge Hannah Dugan, saying her arrest undermines \"centuries of precedent on judicial immunity.\" Dugan, a Milwaukee County circuit court judge, was arrested April 25 by FBI agents on federal allegations she prevented the arrest of a man by immigration authorities during a federal law enforcement operation at her courthouse. The man, Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, was arrested and detained at an immigration detention center. In an amicus brief filed Friday, the group of judges argue that Dugan shouldn't be prosecuted because \"she is entitled to absolute immunity for her official acts.\" \"This bar on prosecution is the same absolute immunity that is given to members of the legislative and executive branches for their actions taken in an official capacity,\" the brief read. The group of 138 former state and federal judges called the prosecution of Dugan,who was indictedby a grand jury earlier this month on one count each of concealing an individual to prevent arrest and obstruction, an \"egregious overreach by the executive branch\" that \"threatens public trust in the judicial system and the ability of the public to avail themselves of courthouses without fear of reprisal.\" \"Allowing prosecution of Judge Dugan for the alleged actions would create a chilling effect on judges that would stifle independent decision-making and cast doubt on the universal recognition that judges are in charge of maintaining order and decorum in their courtrooms and courthouses,\" the group of judges wrote. They also argued that prosecuting Dugan \"threatens to undermine centuries of precedent on judicial immunity, crucial for an effective judiciary.\" Dugan, who was released from custody following her arrest, pleaded not guilty earlier this month. A federal judge set her trial to begin the week of July 21. Dugan has served as a judge in Milwaukee County Circuit Court since 2016, after she was elected withabout 65% of the vote. She was reelected in 2022 after running unopposed. Scott  MacFarlaneandJacob  Rosencontributed to this report. Kierra Frazier is a news editor for CBS News & Stations. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "Trump praises DOGE, says Musk will return to help after last official day",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 30, 2025 / 7:10 PM EDT/ CBS News Washington —President Trump praised Elon Musk for his work through the White House's Department of Government Efficiency as the billionaire's tenure as a \"special government employee\"comes to an end, saying his work \"has been without comparison in modern history.\" \"He's one of the greatest business leaders and innovators the world has ever produced,\" the president said, with Musk standing next to him. \"He stepped forward to put his very great talents into the service of our nation, and we appreciate it.\" The president said that through his work with DOGE, his cost-cutting task force, Musk and his team have overhauled the work of the federal government, calling it \"the most sweeping and consequential government reform program in generations.\" But while Musk came into the second Trump administration with a lofty promise of cutting $1 trillion from the federal budget — and even wielded a \"chainsaw for bureaucracy\" on stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February — he leaves with a tally falling far short of that goal. The White House has said that DOGE's government-slashing efforts have saved roughly $170 billion in spending, but the initiative's \"wall of receipts\" documenting spending cutscontained a number of errorsandmiscalculations. And an analysis from the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service estimated that DOGE's actions could actuallycost the government $135 billionas a result of lost productivity and changes in the status of federal workers. Some have beenmistakenly fired, only to be rehired again. As a special government employee, Musk was limited to working 130 days in a 365-day period, and May 30 was his 130th day. But Mr. Trump indicated Musk will remain involved. \"Many of the DOGE people\" are staying on, Mr. Trump said, \"And Elon's really not leaving. He's going to be back and forth, I think, I have a feeling. It's his baby, and I think he's going to be doing a lot of things.\" During the Oval Office meeting, Mr. Trump also praised a recent,temporary decisionfrom a federal appeals court that reinstated most of his tariffs imposed under an emergency powers law. A three-judge U.S. trade court panel unanimously ruled Wednesday that the 10% tariffs, levied against nearly every U.S. trading partner, were anunlawful exercise of the president's authority. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit temporarily halted that decision while it takes more time to consider an appeal by the Justice Department. \"The tariffs are so important, and that's why we were so happy with the decision yesterday where the tariffs continued, because without the tariffs, our nation would be in peril,\" he said. Earlier this week, Musk announced on X, the social media site he owns, that he would be finishing his time at the White House and thanked Mr. Trump for \"the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,\" an initiative led by DOGE. He predicted DOGE's mission \"will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout government.\" The president had confirmed on social media that Musk's last day would be Friday but added the caveat that \"he will, always, be with us, helping all the way.\" A senior administration official said Musk was set to begin his offboarding process Wednesday night. His departure marks his return to the private sector. Mr. Trump said his administration is \"committed\" to making the cuts made by DOGE permanent and will seek codification by Congress. In his time serving as a senior adviser to the president and leading DOGE, Musk roiled Washington through his team's unsparingcuts to the federal workforce,cancellation of billions of dollarsin federal grants and contracts, anddismantling of several agencies, even if some of those actions have been blocked by the courts. DOGE's cuts have reverberated far outside the nation's capital, withfood banks,nonprofit organizationsandchild abuse prevention programs, among others, impacted. Aid organizationswarned earlier this yearthat the administration's slashing of foreign aid from the U.S. Agency for International Development threatened to exacerbate the devastating famine in Sudan. Musk, speaking in the Oval Office, defended DOGE's work and when pressed on the cuts the task force identified, said he expects it will achieve the $1 trillion goal he touted \"over time.\" \"The DOGE team will only grow stronger over time,\" he said. For his Oval Office appearance, the Tesla CEO wore a DOGE baseball cap and black blazer over a \"DOGEfather\" t shirt.

    "title": "Army circulates guidelines for expelling transgender troops from military",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 30, 2025 / 6:56 PM EDT/ CBS News Washington— Transgender military service members must come forward and voluntarily leave active-duty service next week, by June 6, according to Defense Departmentguidanceissued by Secretary Pete Hegseth. After that, the military is expected to begin involuntary separations for active-duty trans service members who remain. One of the service branches, the Army, on Wednesday issued more guidanceabout how it will identify and interact with soldiers with gender dysphoria, according to documents obtained by CBS News. Although Hegseth had made formal assurances in a Februarymemothattransgender service memberswould be treated with dignity, the Army's new internal directives to units instruct personnel to intentionally address transgender troops — even superior officers — in accordance with an individual's medical assignment at birth rather than by their preferred pronoun. When the military startsforcing outtransgender troops through involuntary separations, soldiers will identify fellow service members suspected of having gender dysphoria following a list of criteria outlined in the guidance. The markers include past requests for grooming standard exemptions tied to medical assignment at birth or the initiation of a medical treatment plan tied to gender dysphoria. \"Overt conduct,\" either on social media or in person, of gender identity differing from assigned sex at birth and even a commander's \"private conversation\" where a soldier disclosed gender dysphoria are considered relevant under the guidance. The commander is expected to initiate a medical record review if aware of any of the criteria above, and service members will also be asked during routine medical check-ups about their identity as a result of the Defense Department's new policy. In a Februarymemofiled with the U.S. District Court in Washington, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said transgender troops will be \"treated with dignity and respect.\" But in public, the Army veteran and former Fox News host has instead railed against transgender service members,sayingat a Special Operations Forces military conference in Florida in May, \"No more dudes in dresses, we're done with that s***.\" The Army guidance also instructs soldiers to use the \"utmost professionalism and treating all individuals with dignity and respect,\" but the policies run counter to transgender social norms, like addressing transgender troops by the pronouns they prefer. ArmyMaj. Kara Corcoran, a transgender infantry officer and Afghanistan veteran with 17 years of military service, now faces separation from the armed forces. She defended the service of transgender troops when contacted Friday by CBS News. \"By implementing this guidance…you're making it worse than the 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy, because you're overtly hunting down and trying to identify transgender service members or anybody that…exhibits symptoms of gender dysphoria,\" Corcoran said. She added: \"Transgender service members have served openly since 2016 without adverse impacts on readiness or unit cohesion. Thousands of transgender troops are combat-tested, having deployed to war zones and executed missions with distincction.\" The Defense Department defines gender dysphoria as a \"marked incongruence between an individual's experienced or expressed gender and their assigned gender, lasting at least six months, as manifested by conditions causing clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\" The Army guidance issued to units on Wednesday begins with the suggestion that identifying with a gender different from one's sex assigned at birth is at odds with the values of truthfulness and discipline expected of service members — even beyond the uniform they wear. The guidance echoes the statements in President Trump's Januaryexecutive orderstating the values of transgender service members represent a departure from the \"humility and selflessness required\" of military members and are \"inconsistent with\" the \"cohesion\" the armed forces demand. Contacted by CBS News on Thursday, an Army spokesperson at the Pentagon said that since May 8, additional guidance has been issued as the service continues to voluntarily separate service members. When asked about soldiers being directed to misgender transgender soldiers, the Army spokesman, who did not want to be identified while speaking on behalf of the service, repeated what was in the guidance obtained by CBS News: \"Pronoun usage when referring to Soldiers must reflect their biological sex. In keeping with good order and discipline, salutations (e.g., addressing a senior officer as \"sir\" or \"ma'am\") must also reflect an individual's biological sex.\" The Army spokesman added, \"The Army recognizes the selfless service of all who have volunteered to serve our great nation. We are in the process of ensuring the Army is aligned with recent policy changes to Soldier requirements. Regardless of potential outcomes, every Soldier will be treated with dignity and respect.\" Commanders have also been instructed to revise official records to reflect service members' sex at birth, rather than their gender identity. In the interim, transgender troops are expected to comply with policies aligned with biological sex—ranging from physical fitness standards to uniform requirements, sleeping quarters and access to restrooms and showers. Under current policy, decisions to separate soldiers outside standard regulatory grounds rest solely with the secretary of the Army — a power typically reserved for exceptional circumstances. Enlisted transgender soldiers will be separated under the Secretarial Plenary Authority, a mechanism the Army itselfacknowledgesis \"exercised sparingly.\" Historically, this little used authority has surfaced during politically fraught chapters of military policy — from discharges over COVID-19 mandate refusals to the now-defunct \"Don't ask, Don't Tell\" era. While both enlisted and officer transgender troops will receive an honorable discharge unless their service warrants a lower characterization, they will also receive an RE-3 enlistment code, meaning they are not eligible to rejoin the Army or any other U.S. military service without a waiver. Army military officers will be separated on the basis that \"their continued service is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\" CBS News has not yet seen directives from the other service branches and whether they mirror the Army's policies. Under the Army guidance obtained by CBS News, transgender officers will receive what's known as a \"Code JDK\" upon separation. The JDK code is for the Military Personnel Security Program, and is typically applied to discharge paperwork where a service member is being separated from the U.S. military for a security reason. Cody Harnish, a former Army Judge Advocate General officer and now a private defense attorney for U.S. service members, told CBS News by phone on Thursday that a JDK separation code is a red flag and signals to other government agencies that the service members were separated for \"national security interests.\" \"This can be a serious roadblock to keeping or transferring a security clearance to future employment requiring a clearance,\" said Harnish. He said under President Trump's executive order revoking gender identity discrimination protections, if a transgender veteran's separation from the military bears this code and is vetted for a job requiring a security clearance, \"being transgender can again be viewed as a security concern.\" Harnish said that having the JDK separation code on their record may be interpreted by future employers \"as evidence of heightened risk, severely complicating or blocking clearance maintenance or transfer after military service.\" But amid the crackdown and political rhetoric surrounding the service of transgender service members, Maj. Corcoran offered a pointed reflection on patriotism, duty, and shared sacrifice. \"It's simple, we transgender service members believe in the same American values you do—liberty and freedom,\" said Corcoran. \"The nation's strength comes together for a common purpose in the face of the ever-increasing hostile global environment. It is in the blood of the warrior spirit that we all stand ready to fight, and if need be, die in the defense of the cherished institutions of America. Let us embody this by serving.\" James LaPorta is a national security coordinating producer in CBS News' Washington bureau.

    "title": "U.S., Israel waiting for Hamas to respond to ceasefire proposal, White House says",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 30, 2025 / 4:45 PM EDT/ CBS News The United States and Israel are waiting forHamasto respond to a 60-dayGaza ceasefireproposal, the White House said Thursday. Israel signed off on a proposal that special envoy Steve Witkoff and President Trump submitted, and it's been sent to Hamas, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. During the proposed 60-day ceasefire, a draft of the deal obtained by CBS News indicated that Hamas would release 10 living hostages and the remains of 18 dead hostages. Israel would release 125 \"life sentence\" prisoners and 1,111 Palestinian detainees as part of the deal, as well as 180 deceased Palestinians. Five living hostages and nine deceased from the \"list of 58\" remaining hostages would be released on the first day of the agreement, while a second group would be released on the seventh day, according to the document. According to the document, humanitarian aid will be sent into Gaza immediately once Hamas agrees to the deal, and it will be distributed through \"agreed upon channels that will include the United Nations and Red Crescent.\" \"I can confirm that special envoy Witkoff and the president submitted a ceasefire proposal to Hamas that Israel backed and supported,\" Leavitt said Thursday. \"Israel signed off on this proposal before it was sent to Hamas. I can also confirm that those discussions are continuing, and we hope that a ceasefire in Gaza will take place so we can return all of the hostages home.\" Leavitt said Hamas hasn't accepted the deal, to her knowledge, but if there is a deal, the public will hear so directly from her, Witkoff or the president himself. Bassem Naim, a senior Hamas official, said in a statement Thursday that the proposal \"fails to meet any of our people's demands, foremost among them an end to the war and famine,\" but the \"movement's leadership is studying the response with full national responsibility, in light of the genocide our people are facing.\" A senior Hamas figure closely involved in negotiations told CBS News they are studying the proposal and don't feel there are a lot of options. Hamas is asking the U.S. for clear guarantees that Israel is not going to attack Gaza within the 60 days of the ceasefire, the senior Hamas figure said. The proposal obtained by CBS News outlines that all Israeli offensive military activities in Gaza will cease once the deal is agreed upon, and that during the 60 days, there will be a cessation of aerial movement in the Gaza Strip for 10 hours daily, or 12 hours daily when the exchange of hostages and prisoners take place. Negotiations for a permanent ceasefire would begin on the first day of the agreement and would include discussing the exchange of the remaining hostages, issues relating to redeployment and withdrawals of Israeli forces, and long-term security within Gaza. President Trump, who on Friday told reporters in the Oval Office that they are \"very close to an agreement on Gaza,\" will personally announce the ceasefire agreement, the proposal says. A source familiar with the U.S. outreach to Hamas tells CBS News that a deal is close, and once a response is received, it will be transmitted directly to Mr. Trump and Witkoff. Mr. Trump has expressed optimism recently that there would be a deal. Hamas still holds 58 hostages, roughly one-third of whom are believed to still be alive, out of about 250 who were taken during the group's terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The rest have either been released during earlier pauses in fighting or have been confirmed dead. An earlier two-month ceasefire between Israel and Hamasended in Marchafter the two sides failed to agree on terms for extending it, and Israel resumed strikes on the Gaza Strip. During that temporary truce, dozens of hostages were released by Hamas in exchange for Israel freeing some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Earlier this month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahusaidhe was open to a temporary ceasefire deal to release more hostages, but \"there will be no way we will stop the war\" until Hamas is defeated. Some 1,200 people were killed in Hamas' 2023 terrorist attack on Israel, mostly civilians. Since then, about 54,000 people have been killed in Israel's war in the Gaza Strip, most of whom are women and children, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health, which does not distinguish between civilian and combatant deaths. Aid deliveries to the Gaza Stripresumed earlier this monthafter a more than two-month blockade. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a controversial new U.S.- and Israeli-backed aid group,began distributing foodthis week.

    "title": "Student visa applicants advised to censor their social media posts",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 30, 2025 / 2:48 PM EDT/ CBS News Counselors who work with foreign students eager to attend college in the U.S. are advising them to purge their social media accounts of posts that could attract the attention of U.S. State Department officials. \"Any new student who comes on board — especially an international student who doesn't have a U.S. passport — we would be going through their social media with them and talk to them about what they are saying on Snapchat, in group chats,\" said Kat Cohen, founder and CEO of IvyWise, an educational consultancy firm for college admissions. \"Because, if the information comes off as being radical or anti-American in some way, it is not going to help them.\" The focus on international students' online profiles follows a new push by the Trump administration toscrutinize social mediaaccounts as part of the evaluation process for student visa applications. In a cable dated May 27 and obtained by CBS News, the State Department said it was preparing to expand social media screening and vetting. The agency did not specify exactly what type of content it would be looking for. \"President Trump will always put the safety of Americans first, and it is a privilege, not a right, to study in the United States,\" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement. \"Enhanced social media vetting is a commonsense measure that will help ensure that guests in our country are not planning to harm Americans, which is a national security priority.\" The new vetting measures build upon an Aprilstatementfrom United States Citizenship and Immigration Services announcing that the agency will be taking into account \"antisemitic activity on social media\" as \"grounds for denying immigration benefit requests.\" Advisers who cater to international students applying to U.S. schools told CBS Moneywatch they are reluctant to advise them to delete their social media accounts outright. But they are urging students to eliminate political-themed posts, especially if they relate to controversial topics such as the wars in Gaza and Ukraine. IvyWise also discourages foreign students from reposting any information they haven't verified themselves, given that it might be inaccurate. \"We don't think students should delete their social media accounts completely,\" Cohen said. \"But we do need to make sure we go through their social media accounts with them to make sure that they are presenting themselves in the best possible light.\" Mandee Heller Adler, founder of International College Counselors, also recommends that students weed out potentially controversial posts, including any opinions or content related to politics. \"I'm not saying that they have to get rid of the whole thing altogether, but certainly delete any political posts,\" Adler told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This is kind of an easy way for kids to protect themselves.\" Sasha Chada, who has led Texas-based college admissions counseling group Ivy Scholars for over a decade, said that asking students to delete their social media would be a \"tall order\" given how deeply ingrained the platforms are in their lives. People aged 18 to 24, for example, make up the largest share of Instagram users worldwide, at 32%, according toSprout Social, a social media management platform. Some critics think the State Department's scrutiny of international students' social accounts will inhibit their freedom of expression. \"While social media vetting of visa applicants isn't new, should the administration's 'expanded vetting' consider political viewpoints, it will certainly scare some would-be applicants into silencing themselves on any topic they feel might contradict the views of President Trump, or his successors,\" said Robert Shibley, special counsel at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, which promotes free speech on college campuses. The State Department did not respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment. \"We take very seriously the process of vetting who it is that comes into the country, and we're going to continue to do that,\" State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters this week, when asked about student visas. Mahsa Khanbabai, an immigration attorney based in Massachusetts whose firm assists with student visas, said she has spoken to dozens of foreign students — both overseas and in the U.S. — some of whom have decided to delete their social media accounts or change them from public to private for protection. Students, she said, are not just concerned about posts on political flashpoints like Gaza, but also their personal views on topics like climate change and reproductive rights advocacy. Recent consultations Khanbabai has had with foreign students have been focused, she said, on helping them determine how strongly they feel about publicizing their views, and giving them a sense of the potential trade-offs when deciding to post or not to post. \"I meet with students to ask them, 'Are you willing to pause engagement on social media to achieve longer-term goals like your career and education, knowing that in the short term you're ultimately kind of maybe sacrificing some of your ethical or moral values?'\" she said.

    "title": "CDC now says kids \"may receive\" COVID-19 vaccines",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 30, 2025 / 2:38 PM EDT/ CBS News The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now says that kids with no underlying health conditions \"may receive\"COVID-19vaccines, dropping a broad recommendation for all children to get vaccinated against the virus. Updates to the CDC'schildhood immunization schedulewere published late Thursday, followingan announcementearlier this week by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that the agency would stop recommending COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and healthy pregnant women. \"Where the parent presents with a desire for their child to be vaccinated, children 6 months and older may receive COVID-19 vaccination, informed by the clinical judgment of a healthcare provider and personal preference and circumstances,\" the CDC says in its new guidance. Thursday's change to what the CDC calls\"shared clinical decision-making\"recommendations for children means that health insurance companies will continue to be required to broadly cover the shots for now in this age group. The agency still broadly recommends COVID-19 vaccines for moderately or severely immunocompromised children, in addition to mostadultsfor now. COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy are now listed as \"No Guidance/Not Applicable,\" where they were previously recommended for all pregnant adults. While Kennedy said inhis video announcementthat healthy pregnant women were also being removed from the CDC's recommended immunization schedule for COVID-19 vaccines, several pages of agency guidance saying that pregnant women are recommended to get vaccinated because of their higher risk of severe disease remain on the CDC's website as of Friday. \"Studies including hundreds of thousands of people around the world show that COVID-19 vaccination before and during pregnancy is safe, effective, and beneficial to both the pregnant woman and the baby. The benefits of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine outweigh any potential risks of vaccination during pregnancy,\" one CDCwebpagestill reads. Health authorities and experts closely watch changes to the CDC's recommendations, usually updated through open meetings of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, since they are tied to policies like liability protections and insurance coverage requirements. The CDC also deleted a statementpreviously onthe childhood immunization schedule that the guidance had been recommended by the committee, approved by the CDC and backed by a number of outside medical groups. So far, the CDC's changes echo what the committeehad already beenconsidering voting on next month: narrowing COVID-19 vaccine recommendations to only older adults and younger ages with risk factors, but still allowing for permissive coverage of others getting vaccinated. The CDC has used \"shared clinical decision-making\" guidance in the past to allow for federal requirements guaranteeing insurance coverage and access to some vaccines, while stopping short of full-throated recommendations for everyone eligible to get a shot. At its last meeting in April, the committee had not signaled that they were planning to lift the recommendation for pregnant women to get vaccinated. Instead, pregnancywas listedduring the meeting as among the underlying conditions that might warrant a continued recommendation for vaccination. Multiple CDC officials said the change came after the agency received a directive signed by Kennedy, shortly after he posted his announcement to social media. Kennedy's memo cited \"a review of the recommendations\" of the Food and Drug Administration and National Institutes of Health, saying that the risks of the COVID-19 vaccine for healthy children \"do not outweigh the purported benefits of the vaccine.\" The directive also cited \"the lack of high-quality data demonstrating safety of the mRNA vaccines during pregnancy combined with the uncertainty of the benefits\" for pregnant moms and their baby. \"Truly the death of expertise. This would be like the secretary of transportation directing that all planes must fly 5,000 feet higher than current. It's vibe-based decision making,\" one federal health official said of the directive. Agency officials overseeing immunization recommendations said they were surprised by Kennedy's move. The Washington Postpreviously reportednews of the directive. \"As you might be aware, the HHS Secretary issued a directive to CDC to update COVID-19 vaccine recommendations on the child and adult immunization schedules. In accordance with that instruction, CDC last night posted updated versions,\" agency officials wrote in an email to staff Friday. Margaret  Brennancontributed to this report.

    "title": "Supreme Court lets Trump end program protecting Haitians, Venezuelans, others",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 30, 2025 / 1:46 PM EDT/ CBS News Washington —The Supreme Court said Friday that it will allow the Trump administration toterminate a programthat allowed more than 500,000 Cubans, Nicaraguans, Haitians and Venezuelans to temporarily live and work in the United States while a legal battle over the effort to end the legal protections proceeds. The high courtagreed to granta request for emergency relief sought by the Justice Department in response to afederal district court orderhalting Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem's decision to revoke en masse a grant of humanitarian parole to migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela through a special program. The parole program, known as CHNV, temporarily protected roughly 532,000 people from the risk of deportation. Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented. Jackson, joined by Sotomayor, wrote that pausing the lower court's order \"would facilitate needless human suffering before the courts have reached a final judgment regarding the legal arguments at issue,\" and she lambasted the majority for determining that it is \"in the public's interest to have the lives of half a million migrants unravel all around us before the dissenting courts decide their legal claims.\" Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said the administration is confident in the legality of its actions and believes the Supreme Court will rule in its favor if it is asked to decide the merits of the Homeland Security secretary's blanket termination of parole. \"Just as we always said, President Trump and Secretary Noem acted within their legal authority to revoke temporary status granted to hundreds of thousands of individuals during the Biden administration,\" she said in a statement. \"The Biden administration's program violated black letter immigration law, incentivized additional illegal immigration, and President Trump fulfilled his promise by eliminating it.\" The Department of Homeland Security said it can now \"once again\" begin removing migrants who received humanitarian parole under the CHNV program. President Trump's administration has been steadily turning to the Supreme Court for emergency relief as it fights more than 200 lawsuits targeting many policies from the president's second-term agenda, though many of the court fights involving his efforts to crack down on immigration into the U.S. have led to heightened tensions with the federal judiciary. The dispute over the administration's attempt to revoke the temporary legal status granted to 532,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans is separate from other challenges to Mr. Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act todeport Venezuelan migrants, which has been blocked by some courts. The high court has alsoallowed the Department of Homeland Securityto revoke protected status for roughly 350,000 Venezuelans for now. Since 1952, federal immigration law has allowed the executive branch to grant noncitizens parole for humanitarian reasons. The Department of Homeland Security created parole processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans during the Biden administration in late 2022 and early 2023, which required migrants seeking parole to apply through a sponsor who is in the U.S. lawfully and authorized them to work in the U.S. for two years. The Biden administration created the programs to address the growing number of migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border and said the protections promoted legal immigration. Itdid not allowthose who came to the U.S. with the temporary protections to renew their parole beyond the two-year period. But soon after Mr. Trump began his second term, he issued an executive order directing the Homeland Security secretary to terminate all parole programs, including CHNV. Acting on the executive order, Noem in March announced the Department of Homeland Security would be ending the CHNV program, with any grants of parole still in effect expiring by April 24. The move is part of the president's broader efforts to tamp down on immigration into the U.S., an issue that emerged as a centerpiece of his 2024 campaign for a second term in the White House. A group of 23 individuals, including several CHNV parolees, and a nonprofit organization challenged Noem's termination of the program, and a federal district court judge in Massachusetts agreed to halt Noem's blanket revocation of migrants' temporary legal status. U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani found that the secretary could not categorically terminate the grants of parole because federal law required parole to be exercised on a case-by-case basis. The Trump administration appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit, which declined to pause the district court's order pending appeal. The Justice Department then sought the Supreme Court's intervention. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued incourt filingsthat the district court's injunction nullifies \"one of the administration's most consequential immigration policy decisions.\" He wrote that order had the effect of \"needlessly upending critical immigration policies that are carefully calibrated to deter illegal entry, vitiating core Executive Branch prerogatives, and undoing democratically approved policies that featured heavily in the November election.\" But lawyers for the parole beneficiaries warned that absent the relief granted by the district judge, roughly half-a-million Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans lawfully in the U.S. \"would have become undocumented, legally unemployable, and subject to mass expulsion on an expedited basis at midnight on April 24.\" \"The secretary is admittedly under no obligation to continue the CHNV parole process that brought class members here, but she nonetheless must respect required procedures and apply the law correctly before revoking their parole and upending their lives and causing mass disruption to their families, employers, and communities,\" they told the justices in afiling, adding that allowing the Trump administration to move forward with its mass termination of parole \"would cause an immense amount of needless human suffering.\" Camilo  Montoya-Galvezcontributed to this report.

    "title": "Facing sky-high medical bills? Your hospital may have overcharged you",
    "article_text": "After Blake Pfeifer, a veteran plumber in Colorado Springs, Colorado, underwent emergency stomach surgery at a nearby nonprofit hospital in 2022, he struggled to understand the bills flooding in for his weeklong stay. The initial charge for the procedure at the University of Colorado Health Memorial Hospital Central was $104,000, his records show. Because Pfeifer had no insurance and would be paying out of pocket, he was quoted a discounted price of $58,124. He said he called the hospital to get clarity on the bills but got nowhere. He began paying some of them and was pursued by a collection agency on others. Then he sought the help of a patient advocacy group. “I’ve always paid my bills,” Pfeifer, 63, said. “I wanted a little better explanation.” The group he worked with,Patient Rights Advocate.org, found that some of his charges were far higher than the amounts UCHealth reported under a federal price transparencyrulethat went into effect in 2021. And that wasn’t the only notable finding: Only 25% of Pfeifer’s charges showed up on the hospital’s required price list and therefore could not be compared at all. Pfeifer’s experience is not uncommon, according to patient advocates, public interest lawyers and Medicare data. The burden of medical debt, a problem faced by 100 million Americans, has pushed many to delay medical care and even file for bankruptcy, research shows. Making these obligations even more ruinous, patient advocates say, is that many may be based on inaccurate health care bills. These discrepancies occur even as hospitals must list prices for care on their websites. The price transparency rule,initiated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, requires facilities to “establish, update, and make public a list of all standard charges for all items and services.” Implemented under the first Trump administration, it aims to help consumers shop for care and compare prices before they go to the hospital. Now, four years after the rule went into effect, hospital billing seems “intentionally complex,” said Cynthia Fisher, founder ofPatient Rights Advocate.org. “Hospitals and insurance companies alike have even hired many middle-player firms to be able to maximize their margins and profits at every single patient encounter,” she added. “Sometimes what we’re finding is the charges like Blake’s that are billed are far beyond even the highest rate that they have within their hospital pricing file.” It adds up to an increasingly costly health care experience for Americans. A West Health-Gallupsurveypublished April 2 found that 35% of respondents said they could not access high-quality, affordable health care — a new high since 2021. UCHealth is a nonprofit hospital system with 14 hospitals in Colorado, southern Wyoming and western Nebraska. In its financial filings, UCHealth says its discount program for self-pay patients like Pfeifer “reduces uninsured patients’ liabilities to a level more equivalent of insured patients.” Some of Pfeifer’s records conflict with this description. Pfeifer received 10 common blood tests, known as a metabolic panel, and was billed $104 for each. By comparison, UCHealth’s public price data shows it charged insured patients between $6.52 and $52.89 for each test in 2022. In another case, Pfeifer was charged $99 for a blood culture to measure bacteria, the records show, while UCHealth’s pricing data listed a range of charges for insured patients of between $8 and $61. For a phosphate level blood test, Pfeifer was billed $30, while insured patients at UCHealth were charged between $3.72 and $22.02. Under Coloradolaw, violations of hospital price transparency requirements are a deceptive trade practice. Dan Weaver, a UCHealth spokesman, said in a statement that the health system “does everything possible to share prices and estimates with our patients, encourage insurance coverage, assist patients in applying for Medicaid and other programs that may offer coverage.” Regarding Pfeifer’s case, Weaver said he could not comment because the hospital had received notice from a lawyer representing Pfeifer that he may file a claim against it. He said the hospital disputes what is in the lawyer’s notice, but he declined to specify what exactly it disputes. Weaver pointed to thestate of Colorado’s 2024 report stating that UCHealth hospitals “are fully compliant with transparency requirements.” For 2022, when Pfeifer received care at UCHealth, the document showed the hospital providing his care received a “fair” transparency rating by the state, above “poor” but below “good.” Weaver added that CMS, which determines hospital compliance with transparency requirements, “has not cited UCHealth or our hospitals for noncompliance.” Enforcement actions are exceedingly rare. CMS’ website listsmonetary penaltiesagainst only 27 hospitals in the four years since the requirements began. (There are 6,000 hospitals nationwide, according to theAmerican Hospital Association.) A December 2024reportfrom the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General found that nearly 40% of the 100 hospitals it studied were not complying with the price transparency requirements. Coloradolawallows patients to sue a hospital bringing a debt collection proceeding against them when they believe the facilities have violated price transparency requirements. Steve Woodrow, a Democratic member of the Colorado House of Representatives and a lawyer at the firm Edelson in Denver, represents Pfeifer. “What happened to Mr. Pfeifer unfortunately repeats itself and plays out across the country thousands of times every year,” Woodrow told NBC News in an interview. “We now have a situation where people are afraid to get medical care because of the financial ramifications.” Last November, the Justice Departmentallegedthat UCHealth had overbilled Medicare and TRICARE, the health insurer for U.S. service members and their families. Between November 2017 and March 31, 2021, the government alleged, providers at UCHealth hospitals submitted inflated Medicare and TRICARE claims for “frequent monitoring of vital signs” among patients in the emergency department. UCHealth agreed to pay $23 million to settle the allegations without an admission of liability. Weaver, the UCHealth spokesperson, said the hospital system settled to prevent a lengthy and costly legal dispute. “UCHealth firmly denies these allegations,” he added, “and maintains that its billing practices align with the guidelines set forth by the American College of Emergency Physicians.” While UCHealth is a nonprofit, it has generated rising revenues and earnings recently. Net patient revenues at UCHealth, itssecuritiesfilings show, totaled $8 billion in fiscal 2024, 17% higher than the previous year. Operating income was $523 million, an increase of 58% over 2023. UCHealth’s charges for care are higher than most other nonprofits’, Medicaredatashows. In fiscal 2022, the most recent figures available, UCHealth charged patients 6.6 times the hospital system’s costs for care. That is far higher than the 4 times, on average, that U.S. nonprofit health systems charged for care that year, according to Ge Bai, a professor of health policy and management at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Weaver, of UCHealth, said the hospital system’s charges are competitive with others. “Last year alone, UCHealth provided $1.3 billion in total community benefits including about $570 million in uncompensated care,” his statement said. It’s problem enough for patients who are overcharged or billed incorrectly for health care. But when hospitals sue to receive payment for those bills, such lawsuits often result in default judgments, legal experts say, issued to patients who don’t appear in court or respond. Default judgments can have dire consequences, including wage garnishments. UCHealth has sued thousands of patients using third parties or debt collection middlemen in recent years, a practice that is examined in new research by academics at theGeorge Washington University Law School, Stanford University’sClinical Excellence ResearchCenterand Fisher’s group. The study, “Hospitals Suing Patients:The Rise of Stealth Intermediaries,” found UCHealth and one debt collection firm brought 12,722 lawsuits against patients from 2019 to 2023. Legal records analyzed by the authors suggested “many of the collection efforts were based on unsubstantiated and inaccurate billing records.” The use of legal middlemen is a national trend and allows hospitals to hide their involvement, avoiding the bad publicity these lawsuits can bring, the research contends. Last year, Colorado lawmakers enactedlegislationbarring hospitals from suing patients under debt collectors’ names, after aninvestigationinto the practice by 9News, an NBC affiliate, and The Colorado Sun. Barak Richmanis the Alexander Hamilton professor of business law at George Washington Law School and a co-author of the study. “What this research shows is people are being pulled into court where a power imbalance takes advantage of them,” he said. “There needs to be a lot of deliberative thought into what to do about courts as it relates to medical debt.” In a statement about the study, UCHealth’s Weaver said those suits make up a “tiny fraction of our patient care — in fact, more than 99.93% of all patient accounts are resolved without a lawsuit.” He added: “This study, based on older data, does not reflect the changes put in place in recent years to minimize billing errors, ensure patients are aware of our financial assistance options, and are well informed of their medical bills.” Damon Carson, a small-business owner in Longmont, Colorado, was sued by a collection company after he received an outpatient endoscopy at a UCHealth hospital in his town. The suit came while he was disputing the hospital’s charges as excessive. A self-pay patient along with his wife, Traci, Carson tried to be a savvy shopper before he went in for the procedure in 2021. He asked for price estimates from several providers, and the nearby UCHealth facility provided one totaling $1,448, according to a court document. Carson paid upfront. “I had the procedure and everything was fine,” Carson told NBC News. “Then the bills started rolling in.” Additional charges of $4,742 drove the total cost for the procedure to around $6,200, a court document shows. Carson said that when he questioned the bills, noting the far lower original estimate, the hospital told him the add-on costs reflected the removal of growths found inside him during surgery. A UCHealth spokesman said the original estimate for Carson’s care was accurate and that he was told there might be additional charges and signed an acknowledgement of that, which the hospital provided to NBC News. (Carson says he recalls no discussion of the potential for additional charges.) When Carson refused to pay, he was sued by Collection Center Inc., a debt collection firm that has often filed lawsuits against patients on behalf of the hospital, the academic study shows. In 2023, Carson and the collection firm conducted a mediation, according to court documents. Carson wound up paying only one-third of the additional charges to settle the case. “I was surprised they caved that fast,” Carson told NBC News. “Traci and I could easily have paid the $4,000 and our lives gone on. But this was a principle thing.” Fisher, the patient advocate, said the outcome of Carson’s case is revealing. “No one should ever pay that first bill,” she said. “The onus of proof needs to be on the hospital and the insurance company to prove that they have not overcharged us.”",

    "title": "At 71, Jackie Chan still does all his own stunts",
    "article_text": "There won't be any simulated roundhouse kicks from Jackie Chan in the new \"Karate Kid\" movie. The legendary actor returns to the big screen as he reprises his role as the wise instructor, Mr. Han, in “Karate Kid: Legends,” in theaters Friday. And it draws on Chan’s legacy. This meant choreographed fight scenes and, most importantly, a lack of CGI. Chan, 71, emphasized the importance of authentic action sequences in martial arts movies. “People definitely don’t like to see Jackie Chan with CGI, of course,” Chan told NBC News. The movie features kung fu prodigy Li Fong entering the ultimate karate competition, guided by Mr. Han and the legendary Karate Kid, Daniel LaRusso. Mr. Han is a counterpart to the beloved Mr. Miyagi from the original 1984 movie. “Karate Kid: Legends” director Jonathan Entwistle said he had a clear vision for the project and wanted it to feel like an early Jackie Chan movie. Chan first played Mr. Han, a maintenance worker and kung fu master, in the 2010 remake of the original film. The veteran actor said he’s happy to be in on the action regarding his stunts and admitted that it has been “easy” for him to adapt as he gets older because it’s all “muscle memory” for him. Chan also said “Karate Kid: Legends” is somewhat of a full circle moment for Asian culture Mr. Han will be mentoring the first Asian American karate kid, portrayed by “American Born Chinese” star Ben Wang. Chan expressed how proud and impressed he was by the young actor as he added a new dimension to the franchise. “Before I met him, I was wondering, ‘What did he do right to get this part?’ There were so many audition tapes!” Chan said. “But when I actually saw him, I knew. His dedication and humbleness and just how much he put into work on this movie, I was definitely impressed.” Pat Morita, who played the iconic Mr. Miyagi in the original “Karate Kid” movie in 1984, was the only Asian American cast member at the time. The lack of representation and some of the plot points have drawn criticism from fans and the Asian community over the years. Despite an imperfect record on representation, Chan said he thinks the movies have helped make strides for cultural awareness. The original “Karate Kid” movie became a cultural phenomenon in the 1980s, known for its underdog story and eventually helping popularize martial arts across the United States. “It gave people a [new] way of looking at Asian culture, not just kung fu or karate, which are typical practices in Asian countries but that’s just [scratching the] surface,” Chan said. “What’s more important is for the audience to know more about Asian culture, or at least part of it.” Chan’s career spans six decades, including memorable roles in “Rush Hour,” “Shanghai Noon” and “Police Story.” The actor became a household name in the United States in the 1990s and 2000s after he brought kung fu and death-defying stunts to the masses. However, his journey to stardom wasn’t always smooth, as his 1980 Hollywood debut, “The Big Brawl,” didn’t quite hit. “To be honest, I was frustrated when I was making ‘The Big Brawl,’ since it wasn’t very much of a success. That’s why I went back to Hong Kong then and continued making my own movies,” Chan said. “But it’s the first time for me to get to know Hollywood filmmaking. I learned a lot and tried to take the stuff I learned back to my crew so we can work better.” He added: “I didn’t know anything back then, I was just a kid. It was all fresh to me. Although it wasn’t very much of a success, it taught me some lessons which I later on put into my own filmmaking.” Chan believes that the upcoming movie captures the true essence of what made the original so popular. “[This movie has] a lot of good and real action in it and you get to feel it only on the big screen. This is also a movie about love, affection, friends and family,” Chan said.",

    "title": "Trump throws another punch at Harvard — demands more social media vetting of visa applicants",
    "article_text": "The Trump administration is escalating its social media vetting of visa applicants seeking to travel to Harvard University, a State Department cable sent to diplomatic posts Friday shows. The cable signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio instructs all U.S. missions and consulates abroad to immediately enhance the vetting of such visa applicants, with the intention of expanding the scrutiny process over time. The vetting will go beyond student applicants, according to the cable seen by NBC News, as it also includes faculty, employees, contractors, guest speakers and tourists. The stepped-up vetting is intended to \"address acute concerns of violence and anti-Semitism at Harvard University\" and calls for vetting of \"any nonimmigrant visa applicant seeking to travel to Harvard University for any purpose,\" the cable states. Non-immigrant visas are for temporary entry to the U.S. In response to an NBC News request for comment on the cable, a  State Department spokesperson said, “The Department does not comment on internal communications.” NBC News also has contacted Harvard for comment. For the expanded social media screening, consular offices have been told to identify applicants with “histories of anti-Semitic harassment and violence, and to duly consider their visa eligibility under U.S. immigration law.” In those instructions, the cable criticizes what the administration described as Harvard’s failure to maintain a campus environment “free from violence and anti-Semitism.\" The cable instructs U.S. consular officers to ask visa applicants to set all their social media accounts to public in the event that they need to be reviewed as part of the vetting. The State Department also instructed officers to “consider whether the lack of any online presence, or having social media accounts restricted to 'private' or with limited visibility, may be reflective of evasiveness and call into question the applicant’s credibility.” On Tuesday, the administrationstopped scheduling new interviews for international studentsseeking visas to study in the U.S. The halt on interviews was intended as a precursor to the expanded social media screening, allowing diplomatic and consular posts to prepare for the larger and adjusted workload. The vetting  is another volley by the administration in itsongoing battle with Harvardand other universities. Harvardhas fought backagainst the administration's attempts to control the university's hiring and admissions, diversity outreach and initiatives and foreign student enrollment. The administration has cut billions in research to pressure Harvard to cede to its demands. On Thursday, a court extended its bar on the Trump administration'sattempt to revoke Harvard's ability to enroll international students. The administration said in its cable that the stepped-up social media vetting of visa applicants to Harvard is a pilot program that could be expanded. Other groups of visa applicants could be included later, the administration said in its cable. Foreign students have been targeted by the administration, stripped of visas and arrested, detained and deported, including those who protested Israel's military response since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel. Rubio said on Wednesday that the State Department would work with the Department of Homeland Security to \"aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students.\"",

    "article_text": "A semi-truck carrying 250 million bees and their hives overturned on a Washington state roadway on Friday, unleashing an ominous cloud of unhappily buzzing insects. But more than two dozen volunteer beekeepers from the region of Whatcom County, snuggled along the U.S.-Canada border, may have saved the day, the Whatcom County Sheriff's Office said. They helped restore hives that had become dislodged in the crash, it said. \"Hive boxes from the overturned truck were recovered, restored and returned to use,\" the sheriff's office said in an update Friday afternoon. \"By morning, most bees should have returned to their hives and those responsible for their delivery will be in charge.\" The workday started with more uncertainty than optimism, as the crash shut down a roadway and inspired the sheriff's office to warn residents it could take a few days to corral the escapees. \"The plan is to allow the bees to re-hive and find their queen bee,\" the office said in an earlier statement. \"That should occur within the next 24-48 hours. The goal is to save as many of the bees as possible.\" Katie Buckley, the pollinator health coordinator for the Washington State Department of Agriculture, indicated many of the bees will not only survive but reconnect with their hives and travel on to their destination. \"Bees are actually surprisingly sturdy,\" she told NBC affiliate KING of Seattle. People should still avoid the bees, and the area of the overturned semi-truck, because they're probably unhappy about being ejected, even if separation from their hives is temporary. \"They're also probably having a bad day,\" she said. The sheriff's office, meanwhile, said the roadway could reopen Saturday morning, when the insects' owners will most likely take over, according to a statement. KING said it was working to determine where the bees were headed. The sheriff's office didn't say. The cause of the crash was not available. The sheriff's office thanked \"the wonderful community of beekeepers,\" saying that its members \"showed up to help ensure the rescue of millions of pollinating honey bees would be as successful as possible.\"",

The crew was still at work Friday after clearing out numerous downed trees to give the family a path out from their home in the community of Blanco, the Oklahoma Department of Corrections said. About a dozen tornadoes touched down in Oklahoma on May 19 assevere storms movedacross the state. J.B. Sharp, a Pittsburg County road foreman, said the inmate crew was “a great help to us.” Margaret Green, warden at the Mack Alford Correctional Center, said she put the crew together after seeing a post on social media saying the county crews needed help. Nearly a dozen minimum-security inmates volunteered to join the cleanup, keeping at it for nearly a week so far. Inmates on such crews are supervised and only inmates who meet specific security and behavior standards can participate, the department said. “I just feel like it was giving back to the community,” Green said. “The inmates felt the same way.

    "title": "Sean Combs' ex-assistant faces aggressive cross-examination from his team",
    "article_text": "This is a free article forDiddy on Trialnewsletter subscribers.Sign upto get exclusive reporting and analysis throughout Sean Combs’ federal trial. Diddy’s former personal assistant, a woman identified in court by the pseudonym “Mia,” returned to the witness stand for another day ofdetailed testimony. Mia has accused Diddy of sexual assault and other physical violence, but her allegations of forced labor are especially crucial for the U.S. government’s racketeering conspiracy case against the rapper. Mia was aggressively cross-examined byBrian Steel, one of Diddy’s lawyers. Steel attempted to undermine Mia’s account, confronting her with pictures and social media posts that appeared to show the ex-assistant enjoying her years working for the wealthy mogul. Mia pushed back, insisting seemingly carefree Instagram photos didn’t reflect her “misery.” Here’s what you need to know about today’s testimony: ALSO: President Donald Trump isn’t ruling out a pardon for Diddy. Trump, asked today whether he would consider taking that step, told reporters in the Oval Office that “nobody’s asked” but that he would “certainly look at the facts.” He went on to say that he hadn’t seen or spoken to the rapper in years, and that he wasn’t following the trial closely. Mia, facing a forceful cross-examination, struck a respectful but defiant tone. She readily acknowledged that she lavished praise and adoration on Diddy in emails, texts and photo captions over the years, even after he allegedly abused her. She came across as confident, far less subdued than she was during pivotal parts of yesterday’s testimony. Diddy seemed especially interested as Steel led Mia through various Instagram posts, at one point putting on his glasses and leaning toward the monitor to get a closer look. The defense pressed Mia on her social media posts and communications in which she complimented Diddy as a “mentor and inspiration.” When she was fired, she was crestfallen, texting, “I’m going to kill myself, my life is over,” and “I’m so heartbroken I can’t breathe.” She confirmed that after leaving Diddy’s employ, she obtained a severance of $400,000. This is all fair game for cross-examination. In fact, it’s essential. So far, a few of the government’s witnesses have described what a horrible person Diddy was — but then testified that they couldn’t bring themselves to walk away from him. The government called an expert to testify that victims of domestic violence find it difficult to extricate themselves from a romantic partner. But is that the same for employees who work for a tyrant? Are they also unable to leave? Maybe. Perhaps members of the jury identify with Mia — perhaps they also once had a horrible boss but felt they couldn’t leave their job. Or maybe they see Mia as less credible because, in their minds, no matter how bad the job is, you can always choose to leave. And it seems no one wanted to leave Diddy, no matter how despicably he behaved. Next week: Diddy’s defense team is expected to continue cross-examining “Mia” on Monday. PSA: Every night during Diddy’s trial, NBC’s “Dateline” will drop special episodes of the “True Crime Weekly” podcast to get you up to speed. “Dateline” correspondentAndrea Canningchats with NBC News’Chloe Melasand special guests — right in front of the courthouse.Listen here. 🎧",

    "article_text": "President Donald Trump has nominated Paul Ingrassia, a former podcast host with a long history of inflammatory remarks, to head the U.S. Office of Special Counsel. “Paul is a highly respected attorney, writer, and Constitutional Scholar, who has done a tremendous job serving as my White House Liaison for Homeland Security,” Trump said in a post on his social media platform Truth Social announcing the nomination Thursday night. Ingrassia is a far-right former podcaster and commentator with a lengthy list of incendiary comments. He has called for Jan. 6 to bedeclared a national holidayto honor the “peaceful protest against a great injustice affecting our electoral system” and dismissed the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel as a “psyop.” He has worked for and praised “manosphere” influencerAndrew Tate, who’s facing rape and human trafficking charges, calling him an “extraordinary human being.” He has referred to Tate as “adissident of authoritarianism”— a title he has said applies as well to white nationalistNick Fuentes, the rapper Ye and Trump. He has also called for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to be jailed, and referred to former Vice President Mike Pence as an “FBI asset.” Ingrassia graduated from Cornell Law in 2022, joined conservative think tank The Claremont Institute later that year, became a leader in the New York Young Republican Club, and then went on to be a frequent presence at Trump rallies andMar-a-Lagoin 2023 and 2024. He’s currently working as the White House liaison to the Department of Homeland Security and was formerly the administration’s liaison to the Justice Department, where he’d been seen walking the halls, touting the president’s agenda and telling people he was acting as the “eyes and ears” of the White House. His post at the Office of Special Counsel will require Senate confirmation. The OSC is an independent federal investigative and prosecuting agency, tasked with shielding federal employees from prohibited personnel practices, including retaliation for whistleblowing. The agency head is confirmed to a five-year term, but Trump fired then-OSC headHampton Dellingerearlier this year. Dellinger, a Biden nominee who was confirmed to the post last year, fought his dismissal in court but eventuallydropped the suit. Ingrassia thanked Trump for nominating him in a post on X. “As Special Counsel, my team and I will make every effort to restore competence and integrity to the Executive Branch — with priority on eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal workforce and revitalize the Rule of Law and Fairness in Hatch Act enforcement,” he wrote.",

    "title": "NAACP calls for emergency shutdown of Musk's supercomputer in Memphis",
    "article_text": "Local regulators should immediately stop Elon Musk’s supercomputer project from operating in South Memphis because it's out of compliance with environmental rules, the NAACP wrote in aletter sent Thursdayto Shelby County officials. The civil rights group addressed the request to Dr. Michelle Taylor, director of the Shelby County Health Department, and to the commissioners of Memphis Light Gas and Water. The health department is responsible for implementing federal air regulations in Shelby County, which encompasses Memphis. “Being the world’s richest man doesn’t give you the right to pollute Black communities and jeopardize the health of its residents,” NAACP president and CEO Derrick Johnson said in a statement to NBC News. “We urge the health department to step in immediately.” When contacted, a spokesperson for Memphis Light Gas and Water said it had not received the NAACP letter and could not comment on it. Neither the health department nor xAI immediately responded to questions aboutthe letter, which was also signed by the presidents of the Tennessee and Memphis chapters of the NAACP. In a previous statement to NBC News, xAI said its \"operations comply with all applicable laws” and that it “works collaboratively with County and City officials, EPA personnel, and community leaders regarding all things that affect Memphis.” xAI hascome under scrutinyin recent months for operating methane gas turbines at its Memphis facility to meet the electricity needs of the supercomputer Colossus. The turbines emit pollutants, including nitrogen oxides and formaldehyde, according to their manufacturer. Environmental groups and the NAACP believe the turbines required permits under the Clean Air Act; the city’s health department, the mayor and the Chamber of Commerce have said permits were not required for the turbines’ first year of use. xAI, which is now seeking a permit for 15 permanent turbines, said those would be equipped with pollution controls and only be used as backup once other energy options are available. Earlier this month, NBC News reported on a South Memphis neighborhood called Boxtown, about two miles from xAI’s facility, where residents are concerned that Musk’s project will harm the area’s already poor air quality. “They got money. And they can do what they want to do, you know, without consulting us,” said Easter Knox, who has lived in the area since 1977. Knox told NBC News she and her husband both struggle with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which can be exacerbated by pollution. Health department officials have been limited in their comments about the project. On Friday, news broke that Taylor, the department head, would beleaving Shelby Countyto oversee the Baltimore City Health Department. Colossus, which xAI calls the world’s largest supercomputer, came online in September 2024 to train Grok, the company’s chatbot. But critics say the project’s potential economic benefit to the community is outweighed by environmental concerns. “While we applaud research and innovation,” the NAACP letter states, “there must be limits that ensure that communities are healthy and alive to enjoy the benefits of any potential innovation.” Shelby County health officials are expected to make a decision on xAI’s application in the coming weeks. Memphis Mayor Paul Young previously told NBC's \"Nightly News\" that the city plans to work with a researcher to implement air monitoring in the months ahead.",

    "title": "A third person has been arrested in the death of a Super Bowl reporter in New Orleans",
    "article_text": "A third person was arrested in thedeath of a Super Bowl reporter in New Orleans, providing fresh evidence of what authorities described Friday as an organized plot to drug and rob people. Police in Kenner, just west of New Orleans, accused Christian Anderson of renting the car used by Danette Colbert,one of two suspects previously charged with second-degree murder, fraud and theft crimes in the Feb. 5 death of Adan Manzano, 27. Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill has described Colbert, 48, as a \"serial fraudster.\" In a news release, the Kenner Police Department said that Anderson, 33, allegedly provided logistical support and spoke extensively with Colbert after Manzano was found dead in a Kenner hotel. The department also accused Anderson of seeking to benefit from Manzano’s stolen assets. Investigators reviewed text messages and digital communications showing that Anderson allegedly “played an active role in a coordinated pattern of targeting victims, drugging them, and stealing personal property, including phones and financial account access,” the department said. Anderson was arrested on suspicion of simple robbery, purse snatching, access device fraud, illegal transmission of money, bank fraud and computer fraud, the department said. It wasn’t immediately clear if he has a lawyer to speak on his behalf. Manzano, a Telemundo reporter, was in New Orleans to cover the Super Bowl. He was last seen entering his hotel room with Colbert on the morning of Feb. 5, Kenner police officials have said. Authoritieshave partly blamed Manzano’s deathon the combined toxic effects of alprazolam, an anti-anxiety drug often sold under the brand name Xanax, and ethanol. It isn't clear how the drug, which Manzano did not have a prescription for, got into his system. A device believed to be Manzano’s cellphone was found at Colbert’s home, police officials have said, and she allegedly used his credit card at a New Orleans-area store. The third alleged accomplice, Rickey White, 34, was arrested in Florida in March on fraud and theft charges. He was extradited to Louisiana andcharged with second-degree murder earlier this month. An attorney for White has denied the charges. Lawyers for Colbert have not responded to requests for comment but have said in court that she should not be judged on her criminal history. Colbert has previously been charged in several other similar fraud cases, some of which included allegations of drugging.In one case,the victim accused her of drugging him, leaving him for dead and stealing tens of thousands of dollars through accounts linked to his iPhone. Colbert was convicted of computer fraud and other charges in October. Despite pleas from the victim, David Butler, that Colbert be given the maximum penalty for what he described in an impact statement as her “continued disregard for others,” she was sentenced to five years of probation in December, two months before Manzano’s death. After NBC News reported on Butler’s case, the Louisiana Attorney General Office intervened and sought a tougher penalty for Colbert. Earlier this month, the judge who imposed probation found Colbert to be a “habitual offender” and sentenced her to 25 years in prison, the prosecutor’s office said. “Danette Colbert will finally be held accountable, and she will no longer be free to continue preying on innocent people,” Butler said afterward. “I sincerely hope this decision brings some peace to other survivors and helps restore their faith in the justice system.” A lawyer for Colbert did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "title": "What's next as Trump vents fury at Vladimir Putin: From the Politics Desk",
    "article_text": "Welcome to the online version ofFrom the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail. In today’s edition, Elon Musk and Donald Trump bid farewell from the Oval Office on live TV. Meanwhile, Kristen Welker digs into Trump’s latest social media salvos at Vladimir Putin and what they could mean for the Russia-Ukraine war. And senior Supreme Court reporter Lawrence Hurley answers a reader question about a notable provision tucked into the House budget bill that passed recently. Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. — Scott Bland Elon Musk stood next to President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Friday, but the physical proximity belied a growing philosophical divide between two of the world’s most powerful men, resulting in the tech mogul’s abrupt announcement that he is departing Washington — without having achieved his goal of decimating the federal government. “He came, he saw, he folded,” Steve Bannon, a senior White House adviser during Trump’s first term who is influential with the working-class wing of Trump’s MAGA base, said in a text exchange with NBC News. Musk, who stood with his arms folded across his chest as he and Trump took questions, sported a bruise near his right eye — an unmistakable metaphor for his tumultuous government service — that he said was incurred while playing with his 5-year-old son X. Trump took a more charitable view of Musk’s tenure during a sprawling news conference in which he also declined to rule out pardoning Sean “Diddy” Combs, who is standing trial on charges of sex trafficking and other alleged crimes; said he dislikes “the concept” of former first lady Jill Biden being forced to testify before Congress about her husband’s mental fitness; and predicted again that Iran is on the cusp of making a deal that would suspend its pursuit of nuclear weapons. “He had to go through the slings and the arrows, which is a shame because he’s an incredible patriot,” Trump said of Musk. Trump and Musk both contended that DOGE will continue to wring out savings by rooting out waste and fraud without Musk as its face. “This is not the end of DOGE, but really the beginning,” Musk said, vowing to reach the trillion-dollar mark in cutsby the middle of next year. At the same time he spoke of cutting government spending, Musk lauded Trump’s remodeling of the Oval Office. “I love the gold on the ceiling,” he said. Musk has argued that inertia throttled his efforts to reduce government spending — a conclusion that raises questions about whether he was naive about the challenge of the mission he undertook. “The federal bureaucracy situation is much worse than I realized,” he toldThe Washington Post this week. “I thought there were problems, but it sure is an uphill battle trying to improve things in D.C., to say the least.” Read more → President Donald Trump has ramped up the rhetoric attacking Russian President Vladimir Putin, but so far there’s no teeth behind it. After months of cutting Putin slack on the world stage and clashing with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Trump has undergone a stark rhetorical shift in recent days. He’s taken to social media to blast Putin for having gone “absolutely crazy” and for “needlessly killing a lot of people” including Ukrainian citizens “for no reason whatsoever.” Hehas warnedthat “what Vladimir Putin doesn’t realize is that if it weren’t for me, lots of really bad things would have already happened to Russia, and I mean REALLY BAD. He’s playing with fire!” Trump appears to now be warming to the belief many Western leaders have held for years — that Putin isn’t seriously pushing for peace, outside of total Russian victory. In recent weeks, we’ve seen some of the biggest bombardments of the entire war, includinga massive drone attack in Kyivthat came in the shadow of a prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine. None of this means Trump is buddy-buddy with Zelenskyy now, and he criticized the Ukrainian as “stubborn” during Friday remarks in the Oval Office, even as he underscored his disappointment with Putin. Meanwhile, the issue of sanctioning Russia and sending aid to Ukraine obviously splits the GOP, and it doesn’t necessarily sit well with the “America First” wing of the GOP that Trump commands. But if Trump wants to act, as former Vice President Mike Pence told me he recommended duringour conversation earlier this month, he has arrows in his quiver. Earlier this week on “Meet the Press Now,” former U.S. ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul told us that the only way to convince Putin to come to the negotiating table is to convince him he can’t advance on the battlefield. While one might think the West is tapped out when it comes to sanctions, McFaul said there’s a lot more on the table, including seizing more assets or banning Russia’s “shadow fleet” that ships oil from docking at Western ports. And just a few days ago, Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley, an elder statesman in the Senate, called on Trump to be as “decisive” in new sanctions against Russia as he’s been in his push against Harvard University. So if Putin has run out of leash with Trump, then what’s the president waiting for? Join us Sunday when we talk about this and a flurry of other important domestic and international issues with House Speaker Mike Johnson and Georgia Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock. Thanks to everyone who emailed us! This week’s reader question is on an under-the-radar provision in Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill.” “I heard that the bill contains language that takes away a judge’s authority to hold someone in contempt when they don’t comply with the court’s orders. Is that true? I’ve seen a lot about the financial implications but nothing on this.” To answer this, we turned to senior Supreme Court reporterLawrence Hurley. Here’s his response: The House bill does indeedinclude a provisionthat would limit the ability of federal judges to hold people in contempt for violating court orders.(Read it here.) The Republican-backed measure comes amidconsiderable pushback on the rightagainst a number of judges who have not only blocked Trump administration policies but have also questioned whether the administration is complying with rulings and at least consideredcontempt proceedings. The provision in question would seek to limit the ability of judges to pursue contempt findings by withholding federal funds that could be used to enforce such a ruling unless the plaintiff posted a bond when seeking a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction. But there is no guarantee the Senate will include the language in its version of the bill, in part because it may fall foul of rules intended to ensure budget bill provisions have a direct link to federal revenues.

    "title": "Influencer drops lawsuit alleging rival creator copied her videos",
    "article_text": "Influencer Sydney Nicole Gifford said in aTikTok videoon Thursday that she has withdrawn her lawsuit against fellow content creator Alyssa Sheil, ending a case that had become closely watched over its possible ramifications for the broader internet content ecosystem. The move comes more than a year after Gifford first sued Sheil, claiming that Sheil had not just stolen the look and style of her videos but sometimes copied them down to the shot. “She would change her hair soon after I changed mine and even got a similar tattoo after I posted mine, so in mirror photos where our faces were covered, it all of a sudden looked even more similar to me with that tattoo,” Gifford said in her TikTok video. “I believe her intention was to look so similar to me and copy my posts so similarly so she could profit off my business.” She also clarified her intention was not to sue simply over aesthetics, but rather over alleged “copyright infringement, Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) violation, trade dress infringement, misappropriation, and vicarious copyright infringement.” Arguments between influencers copying or stealing content from each other typically play out in the digital court of public opinion and rarely, if ever, make it to the actual judicial system. Aesthetics on social media are recycled and reinterpreted so often that it’s nearly impossible to lay claim to owning a look or style online. Gifford’s lawsuit sought to take the issue into the courtroom, attempting to apply laws typically used by traditional media to the relatively lax world of influencer content. The look at the heart of the now-dismissed suit is a minimalist, polished style that is sometimes referred to as the “clean girl” aesthetic. Gifford, whose videos touch on everything from being a mother to fashion and shopping, has amassed more than 956,000 followers between her Instagram and TikTok accounts. Sheil, who posts similar content, has more than 162,000 followers across her Instagram and TikTok. Gifford said she sent many requests for Sheil to stop — from emails to cease-and-desist letters — before suing Sheil in April 2024. Shahmeer Halepota, an attorney for Sheil, said Gifford walked away from the case with no settlement or financial compensation. “Ms. Gifford’s surrender and settlement for $0 confirms that her allegations were meritless and her claims of inventorship were worthless,” Halepota said. Thomas Frashier, another attorney for Sheil, said his client has set a “major precedent” for influencers and social media personalities. “This is a huge win for content creators everywhere who shouldn’t have to fear about being bullied out of the industry by the threat of meritless lawsuits like this one,” he said. However, Gifford’s attorney Kirsten Kumar said her client’s case was not without merit, but that she simply didn’t have the bandwidth to continue with the litigation. “I have been working with Sydney since nearly the beginning of this case,” Kumar said. “I know how strongly she feels about her claims and that the decision to stop litigating is not a reflection of their merit. But priorities can change: Since filing suit, she has gotten married, welcomed her first child and moved out of state.”",

    "title": "Former Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez is still pushing for a Trump pardon before reporting to prison",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump has not ruled out pardoning or commuting the sentence of former Sen. Bob Menendez, though allies believe there is only a small chance that the New Jersey Democrat will receive clemency before he’s scheduled to report to prison next month, according to a White House official and three additional people familiar with the discussions. Menendez allies have made multiple overtures to the White House since Trump took office to request either a pardon or a commutation of his11-year prison sentencefollowing his conviction on bribery and corruption charges, according to four people familiar with the efforts. After one such overture, some of Menendez’s allies were convinced Trump will not grant the New Jersey Democrat clemency, people familiar with the efforts said. But a White House official says Trump has not made a decision on the matter. Earlier this year, Menendez appealed to Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a former Senate colleague and a Trump ally, to request a pardon or sentence commutation on his behalf, according to three people with direct knowledge of that effort. Graham and Menendez have long had a close relationship, with Graham standing by the Democrat during Menendez's first indictment a decade ago on federal corruption charges. But Graham has declined to get involved. Menendez has also tried to use his longtime connections to Jewish leaders in New York and New Jersey as a different avenue to get to Trump, according to two people familiar with those discussions. Menendez was a fierce advocate for Israel during his time in office and has attempted to leverage his ties to prominent Jewish groups and key stakeholders,as NBC News previously reported. Menendez had also reached out to the family of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner for help securing a pardon, but he was rebuffed, according to one source familiar with the attempt. Menendezsought and failed to obtain clemencyfrom President Joe Biden before he left office earlier this year. Menendez pleaded not guilty on federal bribery and corruption charges but was convicted in July and resigned from the Senate in August. Menendez’s wife, Nadine Menendez, was convicted on similar charges in a separate trial. In attempt to appeal to Trump, Menendez has argued that he was politically targeted by the Justice Department.In a Friday post on X, Menendez accused Democrats of “weaponizing the Justice Dept.” against him when he was first indicted in 2015. The Justice Department ultimately dropped that case in 2018. “When, as the Chairman of the [Senate Foreign Relations Committee], I didn’t go along with Obama’s Iran deal, I was indicted, and the next day after being stripped of my position, Obama announced the Iran deal,” Menendez wrote. Despite his appeals to Trump, Menendez does not have a close relationship with the president and has been an adversary at key moments. Menendez joined all Senate Democrats in voting to convict Trump during his two impeachment trials, for instance — an act a person close to Trump previously told NBC Newswould weigh against him.",

    "title": "Indiana woman made Monster Energy bombs she planned to use at her old high school, police say",
    "article_text": "An Indiana 19-year-old was arrested and charged on Thursday after authorities discovered homemade explosive devices in Monster Energy drinks she planned to detonate at her old high school, police said. Ahnna Tipton was being transported by an Evansville police officer to a hospital for evaluation on Thursday, when officials found a suspicious item in Tipton's backpack during intake, according to anEvansville Police Department press releaseFriday. \"The object appeared to be a pill bottle wrapped in duct tape, with a matchstick protruding from the lid and a piece of cloth attached,\" the release stated. An aluminum pipe was also found in the backpack, with both ends sealed with duct tape, authorities said. Hospital officials identified flammable materials inside the pipe and noted a strong chemical odor. The Evansville Police Department Bomb Technicians arrived at the scene and examined the materials, determining they were improvised incendiary devices, officials said. Authorities said Tipton admitted in an interview with technicians that she assembled the devices and revealed there were more located at her home in Warrick County, neighboring Evansville on the Kentucky border. A search warrant was executed at the residence, where the Evansville Hazardous Devices Unit found two more explosive devices concealed in Monster Energy drink bottles, officials said. The construction of the devices and materials matched those found in Tipton's backpack. \"During a post-Miranda interview, Tipton revealed that she had planned to deploy the devices at the high school she previously attended, with the intent to cause harm to others,\" the release stated. Tipton was arrested on a charge of possession of a destructive device and booked in the Vanderburgh County Jail on Thursday evening, according to the jail's recent booking records. It is not clear if she has an attorney. Tipton's bond was set at $50,000 on Friday, according to online Vanderburgh Circuit Court records. Her initial hearing is scheduled for June 4.",

    "title": "Summer rentals in the Hamptons are down 30%",
    "article_text": "Summer rentals in the Hamptons are off to a chilly start to the season, as unrented homes start to pile up and sales slow, according to brokers. Hamptons rentals are down 30% from the same period in previous years, according to Judi Desiderio of William Raveis Real Estate. Brokers who focus on ultra-high-end rentals say their rental business is down between 50% and 75%. “People are holding on to their money,” said Enzo Morabito, head of the Hamptons-based Enzo Morabito Team at Douglas Elliman. “They don’t like uncertainty.” Of course, Hamptons renters often wait until the last minute to book July and August rentals. Brokers say this year may be starting even later due to cold, rainy weather in May. Some renters may also be holding out for better deals in a Hamptons market that has become far more expensive after Covid. Yet brokers and renters say privately that the volatility in the stock market and economic uncertainty sparked by the ever-changingtariff landscapehas made some affluent renters and even some buyers hold off on a pricey Hamptons vacation this summer. After the post-election euphoria in markets at the end of last year, brokers saw a surge in interest from potential renters in January and February. But as spring arrived, along with the April tariff announcements, the early interest didn’t translate into rentals. Morabito said he represents several homeowners with large waterfront and luxury properties that typically would have been rented by March or April. Today, they’re still available. He said some homeowners who rent out three or four homes in the Hamptons during the summer may start to question their investments after this summer if renters don’t start emerging. On the plus side, the rise in unrented inventory means potential bargains and choice for renters. Brokers say some listings have started lowering their prices by 10% to 20% in hopes of saving the summer. Some homeowners are adding more flexibility, allowing for shorter one- or two weeks stays in hopes of getting renters. Gary DePersia of My Hampton Homes said the best houses in the Hamptons typically get rented early in the year. “But this year I have great rentals available in every town, from Southampton to Montauk.” While tariffs and economic uncertainty may play a role in the slump, he said renters seem to have been waiting longer and longer every year, perhaps holding out for better deals. Eventually, he said, they end up renting. “I think a number of people have deferred decisions, or they weren’t sure what [they were] going to do, go to Europe or the West Coast,” he said. “They will realize they want to be in the Hamptons; they have lot of friends and colleagues here and then they start scurrying around for rentals.” Desiderio said the combination of weather and grim economic headlines made for a slow start that will quickly reverse. “I believe this year there was so much ‘dark noise’ out there financially, and geopolitically, and the weather was not conducive to thinking of summertime,” she said. “There’s no doubt that by the time July 1 is upon us, all of the rentals will be taken this year.” When it comes to home sales, the Hamptons real estate market remains fairly strong, despite relatively low inventory. Sales in the first quarter were down 12% from a year ago, although the median sales price jumped 13% to a record $2 million. Brokers say when a quality home in the Hamptons is priced right, it sells immediately. They add that the surge in high-end sales in Manhattan over the past two months could also lift the Hamptons market. “I just had two Canadians put a bid on an $18 million house, sight unseen” Morabito said. “When Manhattan comes alive, we always follow.” This 11,000 square-foot home in Bridgehampton in the Hamptons has slashed its rental price from $450,000 to $375,000 for August through Labor Day.Credit: Courtesy of Corcoran.",

    "title": "CDC says parents can decide with doctors if healthy kids get Covid shots",
    "article_text": "The nation’s top public health agency posted new recommendations that say healthy children and pregnant women may get Covid vaccinations, removing stronger language that those groups should get the shots. The change comes days after U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that Covid vaccines will no longer berecommended for healthy children and pregnant women. But theupdated guidance on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’swebsite sends a more nuanced message, saying shots “may” be given to those groups. “The announcement from earlier this week sounded like CDC was going to fully withdraw any statement that could be construed as a recommendation for these vaccines in these populations,” said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher. “It’s not as bad as it could have been.” Kennedy announced the coming changes in a58-second videoposted on the social media site X on Tuesday. No one from the CDC was in the video, and CDC officials have referred questions about the announcement to Kennedy and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. On Thursday, the CDC updated its website. The agency said that shots may be given to children ages 6 months to 17 years who do not have moderate or severe problems with their immune systems. Instead of recommending the shots, the CDC now says parents may decide to get their children vaccinated in consultation with a doctor. A subtle update to a CDC page on the adult immunization schedule indicated a similar change for the recommendation for pregnant women, excluding them from the routine recommendation made for other adults. “The old COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for healthy children under 18 and for pregnant women have been removed from the CDC vaccine schedule,” a HHS spokesperson said in a statement. “The CDC and HHS encourage individuals to talk with their healthcare provider about any personal medical decision.” That kind of recommendation, known as shared decision-making, still means health insurers must pay for the vaccinations,according tothe CDC. However, experts say vaccination rates tend to be lower when health authorities use that language and doctors are less emphatic with patients about getting shots. Childhood vaccination rates for Covid are already low — just 13% of children and 23% of adults have received the 2024-25 Covid vaccine,according to CDC data. Talk of changing the recommendations has been brewing. As the Covid pandemic has waned, experts have discussed the possibility of focusing vaccination efforts on people 65 and older — who are among those most as risk for death and hospitalization. ACDC advisory panel is set to meet in Juneto make recommendations about the fall shots. Among its options are suggesting shots for high-risk groups but still giving lower-risk people the choice to get vaccinated. A committee work group has endorsed the idea. But Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine advocate before becoming health secretary, decided not to wait for the scientific panel’s review. The new vaccine recommendation changes, their timing and the way there were announced have created confusion that can be “incredibly harmful to the success of vaccination programs,” Schwartz said. “It would be understandable if the public is completely baffled in terms of what the federal government thinks and what the science suggests ... about the evidence for the safety and value of these vaccines,” he added.",

    "title": "Ultramarathon runner breastfeeds her baby 3 times on her way to a surprise win",
    "article_text": "By Bill Chappell Stephanie Case won an ultramarathon race in Wales, running more than 60 miles over rough terrain — and stopping three times to breastfeed her 6-month-old baby, Pepper.Rich Gillhide caption In the sport of ultrarunning, athletes often defy human limits. But at a recent 100-kilometer race in Wales, one runner took it to another level. As seen in photos that quickly went viral, runner — and new mom — Stephanie Case sat down at three points along the demanding race course to breastfeed her six-month-old daughter. Case not only finished the race; she placed first among the female competitors. \"Well that was a surprise,\" Casewrote on Instagram, posting photos of herself feeding her daughter while wearing her racing bib and gear. \"I WON?!?\" Case had no idea victory awaited her at theUltra-Trail Snowdoniarace in Northern Wales. After a three-year break from competing, she was just happy to be running again. And to have a daughter, Pepper, after a long journey that included two miscarriages. \"I think the response has been overwhelmingly positive,\" Case, 42, tells NPR, adding that the reaction \"has shown me that we still have these ideas in our head culturally about what a new mom should look like.\" To her, the photos show \"an athlete being a mom at the same time, and those things not actually competing with one another.\" \"We don't have to lose ourselves in becoming a mom and we can keep setting big goals for ourselves,\" she says. On a practical level, Case's feat raises a key question: How did she make sure to get enough calories to power herself and a whole other human during an ultramarathon? \"It's not just during the race,\" she says. \"It's also in training, to make sure that my milk supply wasn't affected. It's not easy. I feel like I am eating all the time, but actually becoming a mum has made me a lot more efficient in both my training and in my fueling strategies.\" Case, a Canadian human rights lawyer currently based in Chamonix, France, says her coach, Dr. Megan Roche, helped to hone those strategies. \"During the race I was taking in about 80 to 100 grams of carbohydrates an hour,\" she says. \"And I kept that up until about 65K, and then I had to pull back a bit because I was getting quite nauseous. And then I ramped it back up again and was kind of done at 95K. \"That's when I started gettingreallynauseous,\" she says with a laugh. \"It's surprisingly technical,\" Case says of the Snowdonia course, which organizers say has6,500 meters of elevation gain(21,325 feet). Ultrarunners must traverseSnowdon(known in Welsh as Yr Wyddfa), the highest mountain in Wales, and navigate rugged terrain, from boggy fields to craggy ridges and hard shale. \"It's not what you would think of as a typical running race,\" Case says. In some sections, she adds, \"really it's almost like scrambling or climbing, where you're going up kind of a vertical wall of rock.\" Case finished with a time of just over 16 hours and 53 minutes. But she initially had no idea where she hadplaced in the race. Since she hadn't competed in recent years, Case didn't run with the main group of elite female runners — she started 30 minutes later — and had no sense of their pace. Case's partner brought Pepper to the 20-, 50- and 80-kilometer checkpoints. She got special permission for the rendezvous at 50 kilometers, on the stipulation that she couldn't receive aid during the stop. It wasn't until race officials confirmed the time recorded by her tracking chip that the wildly unexpected results emerged: A new mom in her early 40s — who stopped to breastfeed her baby along the grueling course — placed first among the more than 60 female finishers. Stephanie Case says she wondered after she had her daughter, \"Can I still call myself an athlete?\"Rich Gillhide caption Case won the ultramarathon while on parental leave from her job working for the United Nations as a human rights lawyer. Her career has previously taken her to countries such as Afghanistan and South Sudan — places where running long distances helps Case cope with the stress of working in a humanitarian crisis. The experiences  inspired her to foundFree to Run, a nonprofit that empowers girls and young women's in conflict areas through running and other outdoor activities. For Case, the Welsh race in mid-May was her first big competition since the summer of 2022: the Hardrock Hundred Mile Endurance Run in Colorado. \"I got second in that race, and I was just really happy,\" she recalls. Then Case learned she was pregnant — \"and unfortunately, it wound up in a miscarriage,\" she says. \"People questioned whether it was the running that had actually caused the miscarriage,\" she says. \"And there's no science or medical research to indicate that link, but it planted a seed of doubt in my head.\" Once a sanctuary from stress, Case began to wonder if running was \"something that was actually not beneficial for me or helpful for my attempts to have a family.\" She began to withdraw from running. But when she got pregnant and miscarried again, \"people questioned whether it was the stress of my job that caused the miscarriage,\" she says. \"I felt like I was just lost without answers, without a clear path forward of what to do,\" Case says. \"When I lost the running part of me, that was a core part of my identity. That was who I was, how I identified myself, how I kind of moved through the world. And suddenly I didn't have that.\" \"I was dealing with the grief and all of the emotions around pregnancy loss and infertility,\" Case says. \"So when I was finally able to get a successful pregnancy through IVF, I started running again in my second trimester, not in my first trimester at all.\" She felt more confident about her pregnancy, she says — up to a point. \"Even at like 39 weeks, I just couldn't fully relax. Once you've gone through a miscarriage, it doesn't matter what the stats say. It doesn't matter if every doctor in the world tells you, 'You'll be fine.' You don't really believe it until you actually see that baby.\" As a new parent, Case has been wrestling with a new question: How should she see herself? \"You know, do I identify now as a mom?\" she recalls wondering. \"What's going to happen with my career? Can I still call myself an athlete?\" It was a joy, she says, to return to running, to rekindle part of her identity that had gone dormant. \"Once I started training, I really started upping my goals,\" she says. Her initial hope was simply to finish a race. But that was soon replaced by larger ambitions. \"You know, why not set big goals?\" Case says. \"And if I don't do well, I don't do well. But let's see what we can do.\" With that question now answered, Case is preparing for a familiar event: the Hardrock 100. \"In about six weeks I'll be going back to do that same race that kind of set me down this journey\" in 2022, Case says. This time, she'll have Pepper with her. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "The conflict between Israel and Palestinians — and other groups in the Middle East — goes back decades. These stories provide context for current developments and the history that led up to them. By Jane Arraf Displaced Palestinians, including women and children living in tents, receive food distributed by aid organizations in al-Mawasi district of Khan Younis, Gaza, on May 30. In Jordan, tens of thousands of boxes of food aid for Gaza are moldering in warehouses.Abed Rahim/Anadolu via Getty Imageshide caption AMMAN, Jordan — The main warehouse of UNRWA, the United Nations Palestinian refugee agency, is stacked high with tens of thousands of cardboard boxes packed with food meant to avert malnutrition in Gaza. Prevented by Israel since March from entering Gaza, some of it is going bad. \"Some of the food we have is arriving at expiration in July,\" said Jonathan Fowler, anUNRWAspokesperson. That includes 200,000 metric tons of flour. And while some will be distributed if needed to Palestinian refugees in Jordan, \"some of it will have to be dumped,\" he says. He pulls out Turkish chickpeas from a box that also includes packages of yeast, lentils, canned fish and sugar. The tens of thousands of boxes are calibrated for balanced meals and enough to feed 200,000 people for a month. All are moldering in warehouses along with even bigger quantities of food and medicine loaded on trucks that have now waited for months at Israeli border crossings. The United States and U.S. military helped establish Jordan as the main hub for humanitarian aid to Gaza after the war between Israel and the militant group Hamas started in 2023. The kingdom is a U.S. security ally which made peace with Israel decades ago, and the Gaza border is just three hours' drive from Jordan. In the face of increasing malnutrition in Gaza, Israel this week debuted a new mechanism to deliver limited amounts of aid to a small number of locations located in the south of Gaza. And U.N. officials say Israel has made it clear to them that it will no longer allow in aid from Jordan or neighboring Egypt. \"One of the restrictions this last week has been to only bring in goods from Israel,\" said Jonathan Whittall, head of the U.N.'s Office for Humanitarian Affairs in Gaza. \"We haven't been able to bring our goods from Egypt and from Jordan, which has limited on the medical side specifically, what we can bring in and how quickly.\" The move leaves humanitarian goods valued by aid officials in the hundreds of millions of dollars stranded in overheated warehouses and at border crossings. Many of the aid organizations are now paying monthly storage fees for the supplies obtained through public and private donations. Israel has alleged that Hamas was stealing aid. The U.N. — including Cindy McCain, a former U.S. ambassador and now the head of the World Food Program — along with other aid officials say Israel produced no evidence of systematic diversion of aid by Hamas. Many of the groups use proven distribution systems within Gaza built over decades. The new aid organization, called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, has been widely criticized by aid officials. Few details about how the group is financed, or who works for it, have been made public. \"When you have armed personnel manning humanitarian sites, and you have people desperately hungry and in need of aid and not enough aid to meet the need, that's a very volatile combination,\" said Sean Carroll, president and CEO of ANERA, the biggest U.S.-based nongovernmental aid group operating in Gaza. The first head of GHF, Jake Wood, resigned last Sunday,saying the organization was unable to operate according to humanitarian principles. Carroll says aid groups have a combined total of more than 10 million meals waiting in trucks at Israel's Kerem Shalom border crossing with Gaza. Some are actually on the Gaza side but prevented by Israel from going further. Israel has blamed the United Nations for not picking it up and distributing it. GHF's food distribution requires Palestinians in Gaza to travel to one of only a handful of access points in the south of Gaza, in contrast to aid groups that used a variety of distribution methods to deliver food throughout communities. The halt in aid shipments into Gaza has severely curtailed that. \"We've continued to make meals and deliver them, but instead of 100,000 to 150,000 a day, we've been doing 1,000 or 2,000 a day,\" Carroll says. UNRWA, established after the 1948 creation of Israel to care for 700,000 Palestinian refugees forced to flee their homes by war, is the primary provider of primary health care in Gaza. Fowler said their stocks of medical supplies, including basic items such as burn ointments, had been cut to half of needed supplies in the last two months. Rachel Norris, Gaza director for Doctors Without Borders, which operates emergency and other health care facilities, said the months-long ban on aid shipments has left them rationing items like antiseptics, gauze, gloves and painkillers. \"Not only have all our trucks in Jordan gone through the right approval processes but now they've been sitting for so long we are worried that some stock will expire,\" she said. \"Even the most very basic medical supplies that are critical when we're doing wound care and surgery are missing,\" she said by video call from Gaza. \"You know it's heartbreaking when I'm in the hospital like I was today and you see children in agony.\" The Israeli military agency overseeing access at the Gaza border told NPR it had no details on restrictions on aid from Jordan and Egypt. A State Department spokesperson, when asked about U.N. and aid group comments that Israel was barring aid from Jordan and Egypt, said the reports were \"absolutely false.\" The spokesperson insisted on remaining anonymous in line with department policy. Aid groups say aside from the ban on all aid currently stored in Jordan and Egypt is the cumulative effect of Israel's rejection of items it considers of possible military use, such as water treatment chemicals.

    "title": "PBS and Minnesota public TV station sue Trump White House",
    "article_text": "David Folkenflik President Trump issued an executive order directing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and public television stations to withhold funds from PBS. On Friday, PBS — led by Paula Kerger (right) — and Lakeland PBS of Minnesota sued.Andrew Harnik/Getty Images, Nathan Posner/Anadolu via Getty Imageshide caption PBS and a public television station in rural Minnesota filed suit on Friday against President Trump over his executive order demanding that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting kill all funding for the network. The suit allegesTrump's orderis unlawful, exceeding his authority as president and violating Constitutional protections of free speech because he has made clear he doesn't like PBS's news coverage and programming. \"This action challenges an unprecedented presidential directive attacking PBS and its member stations… in a manner that will upend public television,\" the lawsuit states. It continues: \"The EO makes no attempt to hide the fact that it is cutting off the flow of funds to PBS because of the content of PBS programming and out of a desire to alter the content of speech. That is blatant viewpoint discrimination and an infringement of PBS and PBS Member Stations' private editorial discretion.\" PBS President and CEO Paula Kerger declined comment Friday. In a statement, the network said, \"After careful deliberation, PBS reached the conclusion that it was necessary to take legal action to safeguard public television's editorial independence, and to protect the autonomy of PBS member stations.\" The Minnesota station echoed PBS' logic, saying it joined the lawsuit \"to underscore the dire consequences on local member stations and our programming.\" In response, the White House said CPB is \"creating media to support a particular political party on the taxpayers' dime.\" \"Therefore, the President is exercising his lawful authority to limit funding to NPR and PBS,\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in a statement. \"The President was elected with a mandate to ensure efficient use of taxpayer dollars, and he will continue to use his lawful authority to achieve that objective.\" Trump's executive order accuses NPR and PBS of failing to provide \"fair, accurate, unbiased and nonpartisan news.\" He asserts that there are plenty of media options for people to choose from nowadays. \"Government funding of news media in this environment is not only outdated and unnecessary but corrosive to the appearance of journalistic independence,\" the order states.It bans CPB from sending any money to PBS and NPR, and bars local stations from sending the networks any federal money. On social media platforms, Trump hasblastedthe networks in capital letters: \"REPUBLICANS MUST DEFUND AND TOTALLY DISASSOCIATE THEMSELVES FROM NPR & PBS, THE RADICAL LEFT 'MONSTERS' THAT SO BADLY HURT OUR COUNTRY!\" The two networks reject that characterization. Beyond that, the lawsuit filed by PBS and Minnesota affiliate Lakeland PBS argues, \"regardless of any policy disagreements over the role of public television, our Constitution and laws forbid the President from serving as the arbiter of the content of PBS's programming, including by attempting to defund PBS.\" PBS' legal action follows parallel litigation filed on Tuesday by NPR and three Colorado public radio stations against the Trump administration on the same grounds. The public television court filings say PBS would lose $81 million per year in federal grants and \"a substantial portion\" of the $227 million that public TV stations pay it in order to run programs that range from children's shows to Ken Burns documentaries. A day after Trump issued his order, the U.S. Education Department cancelleda grant to CPBand PBS that paid for a major educational initiative - about $31 million annually. Lakeland PBS, serves a region in Northern and central Minnesota that includes some of the state's poorest counties and several tribal reservations. The station offers the only nightly television news program covering the region and offers curricular videos, lesson plans and other resources for local educators, according to the lawsuit. While PBS member stations receive, on average, about 15% of funding directly from CPB, Lakeland PBS relies on federal grants from CPB for 37% of its annual revenues. It says that all of the money it pays PBS for programming and other services comes from those federal funds. PBS shows make up more than half of Lakeland PBS's lineup. The lawsuit contends that Lakeland PBS does not have enough unrestricted funds simply to shift other money over to pay for the cost of PBS programs. And it says that financial support from local companies is declining, not increasing. Locally based philanthropic money has been hard to come by. \"Lakeland PBS cannot readily or affordably replace such content and services,\" the lawsuit states. \"The EO's indirect funding bar thus poses an existential threat to Lakeland PBS, the only local source of television programming for hundreds of thousands of Minnesotans.\" The suit was filed by Akin Gump Strauss, a major Washington-based law firm. Trump's order, issued on May 1st, has been rejected by the board of the privately incorporated CPB, through which federal money allocated by Congress flows to public broadcasters, primarily local stations. CPB has not adopted the president's decree. It is suing him over another executive orderpurporting to fire three of its five members. Like the NPR and PBS lawsuits, CPB's suit points to protections written into law by Congress safeguarding CPB and public broadcasters from political pressure applied by federal officials. They argue that includes the president. According to House Speaker Mike Johnson and other lawmakers, Trump is intending to send a formal request to Congress in early June to rescind the $1.1 billion it has allocated for public broadcasting for the next two years. That spending was approved by the Republican-led U.S. House and Senate earlier this year and signed into law by Trump. It's unclear when the House and Senate will take up the measure, but Johnson recently mentioned the rescissions package as part of a focus on enacting more spending cuts. He vowed to \"act quickly.\" Congress would have 45 days to approve the rescission request, once received, for it to take effect.

    "title": "Trump nominates official with ties to antisemitic extremists to lead ethics agency",
    "article_text": "Tom Dreisbach Paul Ingrassia, who is currently serving as the White House liaison to the Department of Homeland Security, has been nominated to the lead the U.S. Office of Special Counsel.Tia Dufour/U.S. Department of Homeland Securityhide caption President Trump has nominated 30-year-old conservative lawyer Paul Ingrassia, to lead the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, a government ethics office, despite Ingrassia's ties to multiple antisemitic extremists. If confirmed by the Senate, Ingrassia would oversee the agency that enforces the Hatch Act, which limits government employees from engaging in certain partisan political activities, and provides protections to whistleblowers. (The agency is separate and distinct from special counsels appointed by the Department of Justice, such as Robert Mueller or Jack Smith, who investigate sensitive cases.) As NPRreported earlier this month, Jewish civil rights leaders have raised concerns about Ingrassia's ties to extremists, particularly in light of the administration's stated commitment to fighting antisemitism. The Trump Administration recently promoted Kingsley Wilson to the role of Pentagon press secretary over theobjection of the American Jewish Committee, which said Wilson was \"unfit\" for government service, because she shared \"antisemitic conspiracy theories lifted right out of the neo-Nazi playbook.\" The White House has justified the attempted deportation of international students and the withholding of billions of dollars in funding to universities as parts of a plan to combat antisemitic hate. \"Appointing someone to a senior administration role despite their documented support for antisemites seriously conflicts with and undermines ongoing efforts to combat antisemitism at this critical moment,\" the Anti-Defamation League said in a statement in response to Ingrassia's nomination. In contrast to prior leaders of the Office of Special Counsel, who typically had years of legal experience, Ingrassia has only briefly worked as a lawyer. He graduated from Cornell Law School in 2022 and became a registered attorney in New York less than a year ago, in July 2024. He caught the eye of the president through his pro-Trump blog posts during the 2024 presidential campaign and joined the administration in January 2025. \"Paul is a highly respected attorney, writer, and Constitutional Scholar, who has done a tremendous job serving as my White House Liaison for Homeland Security,\" Trump posted on his social media platform, Truth Social. \"Paul holds degrees from both Cornell Law School and Fordham University, where he majored in Mathematics and Economics, graduating near the top of his class. Congratulations Paul!\" In response to NPR's inquiry regarding Ingrassia's ties to extremists, the White House said it stands by the nomination. \"Paul Ingrassia is a respected attorney who has served President Trump exceptionally well and will continue to do so as the next head of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel,\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in an emailed statement. \"The eleventh-hour smear campaign will not deter the President from supporting this nomination, and the administration continues to have full confidence in his ability to advance the President's agenda.\" In recent years, Ingrassia worked on the legal team for Andrew Tate, the \"manosphere\" influencer and self-described \"misogynist\", who has facedallegations of rape and human traffickingin both the United Kingdom and Romania — charges Tate denies. According to theAnti-Defamation League, Tate has also promoted \"Holocaust revisionism\" and antisemitism, and uses \"Jew\" as an insult on social media. Ingrassia has not only assisted in Tate's legal defense, but also praised him as an \"extraordinary man\" and \"the embodiment of the ancient ideal of excellence,\" who has been unjustly targeted by \"the global elites.\" Until recently, Ingrassia's Instagram accountfeatured a pinned photoof him posing with Tate. (The photo remains on his Instagram account, but is no longer pinned to the top of his page.) Ingrassia's ties to antisemitic extremists extend beyond Tate. In June 2024, Ingrassia appeared in the crowd at an impromptu rally for Holocaust denier and white nationalist Nick Fuentes after Fuentes was ejected from a gathering of the young conservative group Turning Point USA. Ingrassia condemned Turning Point for removing Fuentes from their conference, calling it an \"awful decision.\" \"Conservatives should always uphold the First Amendment and allow for dissident voices,\"Ingrassia postedon X. At the Fuentes rally, supporters chanted \"down with Israel,\" and Fuentes told the crowd, \"calling Donald Trump a racist only makes me like him more.\" Ingrassia also wrote aSubstack postcalling on X to remove its ban on Fuentes for promoting hate speech. (Fuentes' account was later restored.) Ingrassia has also attended events supporting defendants charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, including a defendant with a history of extreme antisemitic and racist rhetoric who gave himself a \"Hitler mustache.\" In response to NPR's questions earlier this month, Ingrassia said in an email, \"This narrative you're trying to attach to me that I'm some sort of extremist is lacking in all credibility.\" Ingrassia claimed that he inadvertently attended Fuentes' rally. \"I had no knowledge of who organized the event, observed for 5-10 minutes, then left,\" he wrote to NPR. He did not address Fuentes' well-documented history of antisemitism and racism. Ingrassia also avoided questions about Tate's antisemitic rhetoric. He did denounce the \"hateful or incendiary\" remarks of the Jan. 6 defendant, insisting \"my advocacy for J6ers is not based on any particular remark, but on the principle that all Americans are entitled to due process and free speech.\" Someconservative commentatorshave alsocriticizedIngrassia's social media posts about Israel. Shortly after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing approximately 1,200 people,Ingrassia posted, \"I think we could all admit at this stage that Israel/Palestine, much like Ukraine before it, and BLM before that, and covid/vaccine before that, was yet another psyop.\" (The term \"psyop\" is short for \"psychological operation.\") Despite Ingrassia's extremist ties, Leo Terrell, the leader of the Trump administration's antisemitism task force, praised Ingrassia's nomination to lead the Office of Special Counsel. \"Perfect Choice!\"Terrell wrote. Terrell himself hasfaced criticismfor sharing a social media post by a prominent white supremacist that said, \"Trump has the ability to revoke someone's Jew card.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Billowing smoke from Canadian wildfires wafts into the U.S.",
    "article_text": "By Alana Wise Clouds of wildfire smoke like this one in Flin Flon, Manitoba, are wafting into the Northern Plains and Midwest.Government of Manitoba/Anadolu via Getty Imageshide caption Thick, billowing clouds of smoke are sweeping south from wildfires ravaging the central Canadian province of Manitoba into parts of the United States, compromising air quality for millions of Americans across several northern states. The Manitoba wildfires have forced 17,000 people to flee the province, according to Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew, who called the evacuation the largest in recent history. \"With the wildfires in northern Manitoba intensifying, our government has triggered a provincewide state of emergency to help us through this crisis,\" Kinew saidin a statementon Wednesday. The state of emergency will last 30 days and can be extended as needed. \"This is the largest evacuation Manitoba will have seen in most people's living memory.\" As the out-of-control blazes continue to ravage the province's prized wildlands, heavy clouds of smoke from the fires are making their way into the United States. Meteorologists report that the smoke will waft into the Northern Plains and Midwest. The states most heavily impacted — Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota — have all issuedair quality alertsfor their residents. Alerts in Wisconsin and Michigan counties are in effect until Saturday, with both states warning that the quality of air will become unhealthy for sensitive groups, including children, anyone with respiratory issues and older people. In Minnesota, where the entire state is under alert for compromised air quality, the state's Pollution Control Agency warned that air quality was expected to reach the red category — impacting both sensitive groups and some members of the general public. The Minnesota alert is in effect until Monday. Recent studies have underscored the health dangers of breathing in wildfire smoke. This week, an analysis published in the journalEpidemiologyfound that the risk of going to the hospital for cardiorespiratory problems like hypertension or heart attack rose for months after exposure to smoke — showing that the health effects can linger long after the fires themselves have been put out. This crop of wildfires has struck an already fire-weary nation, after two consecutive years of some of the most destructive wildfires on record. The deadly 2023 wildfire season was the worst in Canada's history, affecting all 13 of the country's provinces. In 2024, while still dealing with fires carried over from the previous year, the nation fared only slightly better, experiencing its worst outbreak of wild blazessince 1995, excluding 2023. Like in 2023, the impacts of the wildfires aren't confined to Canada. Wildfire smoke is pouring over the border into the U.S., impacting air quality and health hundreds of miles from the fires themselves. The U.S. has also battled increasingly devastating wildfires over recent years asclimate changehas made larger wildfires more likely and more intense. Earlier this year, a deadly blaze ripped through Los Angeles for the month of January, killing at least29 peopleand destroyingmore than 12,000homes and buildings.

    "title": "Former Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams wins libel case against BBC over spy murder claim",
    "article_text": "By Fatima Al-Kassab Former Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams leaves the court in Dublin on Friday after winning one of Ireland's highest-profile cases.Charles McQuillan/Getty Imageshide caption LONDON —  Gerry Adams, the former president of Sinn Fein, the Irish republican party, has won his libel case against the BBC over a documentary that claimed he sanctioned the 2006 murder of a British spy. This was one of Ireland's most high-profile lawsuits, pitting the U.K. national broadcaster against the man who transformed Sinn Fein, once the political wing of a group designated as a terrorist organization by the United States and U.K. — the Irish Republican Army —into a modern political party. The jury at the High Court in Dublin returned a verdict after almost seven hours of deliberations, awarding Adams damages of 100,000 euros ($113,000). The four-week trial covered Adams' alleged membership in the IRA and his role during the decades of Roman Catholic and Protestant fighting in Northern Ireland known asthe Troubles. Adams, 76, was the president of Sinn Fein from 1983 to 2018. He has always denied being a member of the IRA militant group. The jury decided that the BBC had defamed Adams in a 2016 episode of the BBC Northern IrelandSpotlightdocumentary series and in an accompanying online story. Adams said the BBC had wrongly claimed, based on an anonymous source, that he authorized the murder ofDenis Donaldson, a British MI5 spy and former Sinn Fein official who was shot in the head in 2006. The jury rejected the BBC's defense that its journalism was fair, responsible and in the public interest. Outside the court, Adams spoke to reporters in both Irish and English and said the case was about \"putting manners on the BBC.\" He said the BBC \"upholds the ethos of the British state in Ireland\" and that it \"was out of sync\" with theGood Friday Agreement, the 1998 peace deal that formally ended the Troubles in Northern Ireland. \"It hasn't caught on to where we are on this island as part of the process, the continuing process, of building peace and justice, and harmony, and, hopefully, in the time ahead, unity,\" he said. The director of BBC Northern Ireland, Adam Smyth, told reporters outside the court he was disappointed by the verdict, saying, \"We believe we supplied extensive evidence to the court of the careful editorial processes and journalistic diligence applied to this program and the accompanying online article.\" The BBC argued the claims made in theSpotlightdocumentary — that Adams had sanctioned the murder of Donaldson — were couched as allegations. Adams argued they were presented as fact. Donaldson was shot dead in County Donegal months after admitting he had been a spy for British intelligence, working for the police and MI5 inside Sinn Fein for twodecades. TheSpotlightprogram featured an anonymous source who claimed that Adams had sanctioned Donaldson's killing, saying murders had to be approved by the leadership of the IRA. When the presenter of the program asked the anonymous source whom he was specifically referring to, he replied, \"Gerry Adams. He gives the final say.\" A main issue in the trial was Adams' alleged past as an IRA leader — a claim that Adams has always rejected. No one has ever been convicted in connection with Donaldson's death. The Real IRA — a dissident republican group that was born out of a split in the Provisional IRA, the group that participated in Northern Ireland's peace process —claimed responsibilityfor his killing. An investigation by the Irish police is still ongoing. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "French health ministry extends smoking ban",
    "article_text": "Eleanor Beardsley A man smokes a cigarette outside a brasserie, in front of a sticker on a window reading: \"Smoking is forbidden.\"Jacques Brinon/APhide caption PARIS — France will ban smoking on beaches, in public gardens and near schools starting from July 1st in an effort to protect young people from tobacco and limit the influence of smokers upon them. \"Tobacco must disappear where there are children,\" said Health Minister Catherine Vautrin, in an interview with French newspaperOuest-Franceon Thursday. Vautrin emphasized that the freedom to smoke \"ends where children's right to breathe clean air begins.\" Middle and high schools will also be affected by the ban, particularly to prevent \"students from smoking in front of their schools,\" said Vautrin. Any American visitor to France will be struck by the number of smokers in general and especially the number of young peoplepuffing awayon café terraces. But tobacco use in France has actually been on thedeclinein recent years. Smoking is at its lowest level since the 1990s with 23% of the adult population reporting lighting up every day. Tobacco use is also declining among young people — only 16% of 17-year-olds report smoking, whereas six years ago it was 25%. The expansion of smoke-free zones is one of the measures outlined in a national plan to reduce tobacco use and achieve a tobacco free generation by 2032. Failure to comply with the ban could result in a fine of €135. Nearly 7,000 smoke-free zones have already been created by 1,600 volunteer cities and towns, including beaches, parks, ski slopes and areas around schools. The new measure has strong public support. According to a survey conducted for theFrench League Against Cancer, 78% of respondents wanted to do away with cigarettes in new public spaces. Speaking to newspaper Le Monde, Daniel Thomas, a spokesperson for the French Society of Tobacco Studies called it \"an excellent measure\" that \"widens the space for denormalizing tobacco use.\" France first banned smoking inside public buildings in 2007, a ban that wasextendedto cafés, restaurants and nightclubs in 2008. Many thought the ban would be difficult to enforce considering the place the smoky café holds in French cultural lore. While it was immediately successful, smokers simply migrated outside, turning the sidewalk into the place to avoid if you're a non-smoker. The French health ministryattributes around 200 deaths per day to tobacco use, making it the leading preventable cause of death. The societal cost of tobacco is estimated at €156 billion a year. It is also a major pollutant, with 20,000 to 25,000 metric tons of cigarette butts discarded annually. The city of Paris has just launched a new campaign to reduce the 2 billion cigarette butts left on its streets every year. The new ban will not apply to e-cigarettes, which have been on the rise in the past five years with 6% of adults saying they now use them. On a park bench under a tree in Paris 15th arrondissement, 26-year-old student Ouadere Thevet is enjoying a smoke. Kids play on a jungle gym nearby. Even though he won't be able to do this after June, Thevet says he's for the measure. \"We can always find other smoking spots like outdoor cafés,\" he says. \"This hurts kids so we shouldn't do it around them.\" Thevet says he became a smoker after fooling around with cigarettes with his friends in his teens. He thinks the measure could have a big impact. \"I think restricting the places where you can smoke might actually push a lot of people to quit.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Supreme Court allows Trump administration to end humanitarian status for some migrants",
    "article_text": "Nina Totenberg The U.S. Supreme CourtDrew Angerer/Getty Imageshide caption The Supreme Court on Fridayallowed the Trump administration to temporarily pause a humanitarian program that has allowed nearly half a million people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela to enter the U.S. and remain here legally for two years. The move to grant a stay in the case means that the Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who were granted temporary parole under the program known as CHNV would lose their temporary legal status to be in the U.S. — and could potentially be deported while the case plays out in the lower courts. The court did not give a reason in its brief order. But in a lengthy dissent from Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor joining, Jackson wrote that the court \"has plainly botched this assessment today\" in causing irreparable harm for everyone admitted under the program. \"It undervalues the devastating consequences of allowing the Government to precipitously upend the lives and livelihoods of nearly half a million noncitizens while their legal claims are pending,\" Jackson wrote in the dissent. The program, put in place by the Biden administration in 2021, and then again in 2023, has allowed individuals from the four countries to enter the U.S. temporarily for humanitarian reasons, usually because conditions in their home country pose a threat to their safety. Karen Tumlin, co-counsel for the immigrants, fought back tears, as she described the effects of what she said was the largest mass deportation in the nation's history. These people, she said, played by the rules to enter the country legally, with the promise of being legal immigrants for two years. \"The Trump administration unilaterally and prematurely reneged on that promise, ordering a termination of their lawful status and clawing back their work permits,\" she said. This, she said, is a sad day, \"not just sad for our clients, but for the hundreds of thousand of other people—Ukrainians fleeing Russian invasion, Afghans who assisted our U.S. military service members—whose parole status has also been threatened who may now suffer the exact same fate.\" The federal law authorizing such humanitarian \"parole\" dates back to the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act. It was first used to provide temporary entry for some 30,000 Hungarians fleeing their country after a failed attempt at overturning Soviet rule and a crackdown that followed. In the decades since then, every administration, including the first Trump administration, has used the parole program to meet some emergency immigration need, allowing individuals who have been screened and approved to enter the U.S. if they have a U.S. sponsor willing to provide financial and other support. Individuals granted such temporary status can, once here, apply for asylum or some other more permanent status. The Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela parole program, known as the CHNV program, is similar to programs created in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine when some 200,000 people were granted temporary parole, and the U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan, when more than 76,000 Afghanis fled, many of them people who worked to assist U.S. forces there. So far, the Trump administration has not tried to end the Ukraine programs, but it has terminated the Afghan program, effective July 14. President Trump, however, on the day he took officesigned an executive orderdirecting the Department of Homeland Security to end \"all categorical parole programs.\" In March, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem formally announced the termination of the CHNV parole process, declaring that it was being terminated immediately, and that the cessation would apply to all people currently enrolled in the program. It was the first en masse termination of such a program on record. Noem's order said that the interests of the parolees, and their reliance on the government's promise of protection for two years, were outweighed by the government's \"strong interest\" in deporting them through expedited removal, rather than normal removal proceedings under the Immigration and Nationality Act. A group of individuals whose temporary protection had been guaranteed for two years, and their sponsors, challenged Noem's order in court, and a federal district court judge in Massachusetts ruled in their favor. Judge Indira Talwani said that the secretary had erred in seeking to expedite removal of individuals who still had time left on their promised two-year protection in the U.S. The judge also said that the secretary's en masse ending of the two-year term violated the statutory requirement that parole be determined only on a case-by-case basis. For these and other reasons, the judge ordered DHS to pause the truncation of all the existing CHNV paroles pending further review. The First Circuit Court of Appeals refused to immediately intervene, but directed the government to seek expedited appeal on the merits of the case if it wished to. Instead, however, the government appealed directly to the Supreme Court seeking reversal of the district court order. It argued that the secretary's decision to truncate the two-year term set out by the Biden administration is not reviewable by the courts. It contended that nothing in the statute requires a case-by-case treatment of parolees, and that requiring such a case-by-case termination would be extremely burdensome for the government. Indeed, the government contended that all it was doing was modifying the two-year term extended by the Biden administration and in its place putting a shorter term of protected status. Finally, the government argued that actions related to the parole program are not reviewable by the courts. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Google and DOJ tussle over how AI will remake the web in antitrust closing arguments",
    "article_text": "Google and the DOJ get one last chance to make their cases. From its humble beginnings in the late 20th century, Google has come to dominate online searches, putting it squarely in the US government's antitrust crosshairs. The ongoing search antitrust case threatens to upend Google's dominance, giving smaller players a chance to thrive and possibly wiping others out. Afterwrapping up testimonyin the case earlier this month, lawyers for Google and the Department of Justice have now made their closing arguments. The DOJ won the initial trial, securing a ruling that Google used anticompetitive practices to maintain its monopoly in general search. During the time this case has taken to meander its way through the legal system, the online landscape has been radically altered, making it harder than ever to envision a post-Google Internet. To address Google's monopoly, the DOJ is asking United States District Judge Amit Mehta to impose limits on Google's business dealings and order adivestment of the Chrome browser. Forcing the sale of Chrome would be a major penalty and a coup for the DOJ lawyers, but this issue has been overshadowed somewhat as the case drags on. During closing arguments, the two sides dueled over how Google's search deals and the rise of AI could change the Internet as we know it. This case has examined the myriad ways Google used its influence and money to suppress competition. One of the DOJ's main targets is the placement deals Google signs with companies like Apple and Mozilla to be the default search provider. Google has contended that people can change the defaults anytime they wish, but the DOJ produced evidence at trial that almost no one does, and Google knows that. During closing arguments,  Mehta asked both sides about testimony from a Mozilla executive alleging that losing the Google search deal could destroy the company. Similarly, Apple's Eddie Cue said he loses sleep over the possibility oflosing the Google revenue—unsurprising as the arrangement is believed to net the company $20 billion per year. The DOJ's David Dahlquist admitted that there could be some \"private impact\" but contended Apple and Mozilla are overestimating the risk. Mehta didn't seem totally satisfied with the government's position, noting that he didn't want to damage other markets in an effort to fix search. Google's counsel also went after the government on the privacy front. One of the DOJ's proposed remedies would require Google to license its search index and algorithm, which CEO Sundar Pichai claimed wasno better than a spinoffof Google's core product. Google also claims that forcing it to license search would put everyone's privacy at risk because it has a vast amount of user data that fuels search. Google attorney John Schmidtlein said the DOJ's treatment of user privacy in the remedies was a \"complete failure.\" Mehta questioned the government lawyers pointedly on the issue of privacy, which he noted was barely addressed in the remedy filings. The DOJ's Adam Severt suggested an independent committee would have to be empaneled to decide how to handle Google's user data, but he was vague on how long such a process could take. Google's team didn't like this idea at all. During testimony in early May, Mehta commented that the role AI plays in the trial had evolved very quickly. In 2023, everyone in his courtroom agreed that the impact of AI on search was still years away, and that's definitely not the case now. That same thread is present in closing arguments. Mehta asked the DOJ's Dahlquist if someone new was just going to \"come off the sidelines\" and build a new link-based search product, given  the developments with AI. Dahlquist didn't answer directly, noting that although generative AI products didn't exist at the time covered by the antitrust action, they would be key to search going forward. Google certainly believes the AI future is already here—it has goneall-in with AIsearch over the past year. At the same time, Google is seeking to set itself apart from AI upstarts. \"Generative AI companies are not trying to out-Google Google,\" said Schmidtlein. Google's team contends that its actions have not harmed any AI products like ChatGPT or Perplexity, and at any rate, they are not in the search market as defined by the court. Mehta mused about the future of search, suggesting we may have to rethink what a general search engine is in 2025. \"Maybe people don’t want 10 blue links anymore,\" he said. At times during the case, Mehta has expressed skepticism about the divestment of Chrome. During closing arguments, Dahlquist reiterated the close relationship between search and browsers, reminding the court that 35 percent of Google's search volume comes from Chrome. Mehta now seems more receptive to a Chrome split than before, perhaps in part because the effects of the other remedies are becoming so murky. He called the Chrome divestment \"less speculative\" and \"more elegant\" than the data and placement remedies. Google again claimed, as it has throughout the remedy phase, that forcing it to give up Chrome is unsupported in the law and that Chrome's dominance is a result of innovation. Credit:\n\n          \n          Aurich Lawson Even if Mehta leans toward ordering this remedy, Chromium may be a sticking point. The judge seems unconvinced that the supposed buyers—a group which apparentlyincludes almost every major tech firm—have the scale and expertise needed to maintain Chromium. This open source project forms the foundation of many other browsers, making its continued smooth operation critical to the web. If Google gives up Chrome, Chromium goes with it, but what about the people who maintain it? The DOJ contends that it's common for employees to come along with an acquisition, but that's far from certain. There was some discussion of ensuring a buyer could commit to hiring staff to maintain Chromium. The DOJ suggests Google could be ordered to provide financial incentives to ensure critical roles are filled, but that sounds potentially messy. A Chrome sale seems more likely now than it did earlier, but nothing is assured yet. Following the final arguments from each side, it's up to Mehta to mull over the facts before deciding Google's fate. That's expected to happen in August, but nothing will change for Google right away. The company has already confirmed it will appeal the case, hoping to have the original ruling overturned.

    "title": "Amazon Fire Sticks enable “billions of dollars” worth of streaming piracy",
    "article_text": "Research firm blames outdated DRM tech, Facebook ads, Amazon hardware, and more. Amazon Fire Sticks are enabling “billions of dollars” worth of streaming piracy, according to a report today from Enders Analysis, a media, entertainment, and telecommunications research firm. Technologies from other media conglomerates, Microsoft, Google, and Facebook, are also enabling what the report’s authors deem an “industrial scale of theft.\" The report, \"Video piracy: Big tech is clearly unwilling to address the problem,\" focuses on the European market but highlights the global growth of piracy of streaming services as they increasingly acquire rights to live programs, like sporting events. Per theBBC, the report points to the availability of multiple, simultaneous illegal streams for big events that draw tens of thousands of pirate viewers. Enders' report places some blame on Facebook for showing advertisements for access to illegal streams, as well as Google and Microsoft for the alleged “continued depreciation” of their digital rights management (DRM) systems, Widevine and PlayReady, respectively. Ars Technica reached out to Facebook, Google, and Microsoft for comment but didn’t receive a response before publication. The report echoes complaints shared throughout the industry, including by the world’s largest European soccer streamer, DAZN. Streaming piracy is “almost a crisis for the sports rights industry,” DAZN’s head of global rights, Tom Burrows,saidat The Financial Times’ Business of Football Summit in February. At the same event, Nick Herm, COO of Comcast-owned European telecommunication firm Sky Group, estimated that piracy was costing his company “hundreds of millions of dollars” in revenue. At the time, Enders co-founder Claire Enders said that the pirating of sporting events accounts for “about 50 percent of most markets.” Friday's Enders report named Fire Sticks as a significant contributor to streaming piracy, calling the hardware a “piracy enabler.” Enders’ report pointed to security risks that pirate viewers face, including providing credit card information and email addresses to unknown entities, which can make people vulnerable to phishing and malware. However, reports of phishing and malware stemming from streaming piracy, which occurs through various methods besides a Fire TV Stick, seem to be rather limited. Still, at the February Financial Times event, Herm said that Fire Sticks account “for about half of the piracy in the UK.” “People think that because it’s a legitimate brand, it must be OK. So they give their credit card details to criminal gangs. Amazon is not engaging with us as much as we’d like,\" he said. In the UK, there has been a push tocrack downonillegal usageof Fire Sticks. For example, in November 2024, a man received athree-year, four-month sentencefor hacking Fire Sticks. In June 2024, another man got atwo-year suspended sentenceafter a police raid found jailbroken Fire Sticks in his home. In the US, however, there aren’t nearly as many publicized efforts to combat illegal streaming on Amazon devices. While Enders’ report accuses Amazon of contributing to the piracy problem, as the owner of its own streaming service, Prime Video, Amazon has an incentive to fight piracy. Amazon’s streaming business includes selling streaming hardware, but the business is more centered on getting people to sign up for Amazon services (like Prime Video), data collection, and ad sales. When reached for comment, an Amazon spokesperson told Ars Technica: Pirated content violates our policies regarding intellectual property rights and compromises the security and privacy of our customers. We work with industry partners and relevant authorities to combat piracy and protect customers from the risks associated with pirated content. Our Appstore prohibits apps that infringe upon the rights of third parties, and we warn customers of the risks associated with installing or using apps from unknown sources. Amazon’s representative also told Ars that Amazon works with industry partners to break up piracy networks and has assisted law enforcement efforts, including thePolice Intellectual Property Crime Unitin London andUK IP Crime Group. Enders’ report also blamed poorly updated DRM systems, especially from Google and Microsoft, for contributing to streaming piracy. Google’s Widevine and Microsoft’s PlayReady \"are now compromised across various security levels,” the report said, pointing to a lack of upkeep. Microsoft issued its most recent big update to PlayReady,version 4.6, in December 2022. The report authors wrote: Over twenty years since launch, the DRM solutions provided by Google and Microsoft are in steep decline. A complete overhaul of the technology architecture, licensing, and support model is needed. Lack of engagement with content owners indicates this a low priority. Outside of Enders' report, Google was criticized by the Italian government earlier this year for allegedly failing to block pirate websites identified by Italy’s communication regulator, AGCOM. In March, the Court of Milan ordered Google topoison its public DNS serverswith the goal of blocking illegal soccer streams. And beyond the aforementioned tech giants, earlier this month, France ordered five VPN providers (NordVPN, ExpressVPN, Surfshark, Proton VPN, and CyberGhost) to block illegal sports streaming sites. Unsurprisingly, the move has beenslammed by VPN providersas setting “a dangerous precedent,\" per i2Coalition, an Internet infrastructure trade association that manages the internationalVPN Trust Initiativeconsortium of VPN providers. As the Internet solidifies its position as the primary method for watching shows, movies, and, increasingly, live events, it presents new challenges to content distributors and owners seeking to curb online piracy. In the case of sports, especially, the distribution of sports rights across various linear networks and streaming services often means signing up for multiple services in order to watch a single team’s season. For some fans—includingNFL players themselves—that's financially and/or logistically impractical. Simultaneously, anti-piracy advocates argue that piracy could lead to higher subscription fees for streaming services. As legislation and rights holders become more stringent about piracy, we can expect more effort from tech providers and law enforcement to block piracy, while hackers also seek new ways to enable illegal streams.

    "title": "CDC updates COVID vaccine recommendations, but not how RFK Jr. wanted",
    "article_text": "Mixed messages only add to uncertainty about vaccine access for kids, pregnant individuals. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday updated its immunization schedules for children and adults topartiallyreflect the abrupt changes announced by health secretary and anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. earlier this week. Ina 58-second videoposted on social media on Tuesday, May 27,Kennedy said he was unilaterally revoking the CDC's recommendationsthat healthy children and pregnant people get COVID-19 vaccines. \"I couldn’t be more pleased to announce that, as of today, the COVID vaccine for healthy children and healthy pregnant women has been removed from the CDC recommended immunization schedule,\" Kennedy said in the video. The health agency's immunization schedules were not, in fact, updated at the time of the announcement, though.The Washington Post subsequently reportedthat the CDC was blindsided by the announcement. Five hours went by after the video was posted before CDC officials said they received a one-page \"secretarial directive\" about the changes, which was signed by Kennedy and puzzlingly dated May 19, according to the Post. Late Thursday, the CDC updated the immunization schedules. Contradicting what Kennedy said in the video, the CDC did not remove its recommendation for COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children inthe child and adolescent immunization schedule. Instead, it added a stipulation that if a child's doctor agrees with the vaccination and parents \"desire for their child to be vaccinated,\" healthy children can get vaccinated. In practice, it is unclear how this change will affect access to the vaccines. Health insurers are required to cover vaccines on the CDC schedules. But, it's yet to be seen if children will only be able to get vaccinated at their doctor's office (rather than a pharmacy or vaccine clinic) or if additional consent forms would be required, etc. Uncertainty about the changes and requirements alone may lead to fewer children getting vaccinated. In the adult immunization schedule, when viewed \"by medical condition or other indication\" (table 2), the COVID-19 vaccination recommendation for pregnancy is now shaded gray, meaning \"no guidance/not applicable.\" Hovering a cursor over the box brings up the recommendation to \"Delay vaccination until after pregnancy if vaccine is indicated.\" Previously,COVID-19 vaccines were recommended during pregnancy. The change makes it less likely that health insurers will cover the cost of vaccination during pregnancy. The change is at odds with Trump's Food and Drug Administration, which just last week confirmed thatpregnancy puts people at increased risk of severe COVID-19and, therefore, vaccination is recommended. Medical experts have decried the loss of the recommendation, which is also at odds withclear datashowing therisks of COVID-19 during pregnancyand the benefits of vaccination. The President of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) put out a statement shortly after the Tuesday video, saying that the organization was \"extremely disappointed\" with Kennedy's announcement. \"It is very clear that COVID-19 infection during pregnancy can be catastrophic and lead to major disability, and it can cause devastating consequences for families,\" ACOG President Steven Fleischman said.

    "title": "Spy-catcher saw “stupid” tech errors others made. FBI says he then made his own.",
    "article_text": "The wrong way to get out of Trump's America. Twenty-eight-year-old Nathan Laatsch was, until yesterday, a cybersecurity employee at the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). He had a Top Secret clearance and worked in the Insider Threat Division. Laatsch spent his days—you'll understand the past tense in a moment—\"enabling user monitoring on individuals with access to DIA systems,\" including employees under surreptitious internal investigation. Given that Laatsch was one of those who \"watched the watchers,\" he appears to have had supreme confidence in his own ability to avoid detection should he decide to go rogue. \"Stupid mistakes\" made by other idiots would \"not be difficult for me to avoid,\" he once wrote. DIA couldn't even launch an investigation of Laatsch without him knowing that something was up. The Greeks had a word for this:hubris. Laatsch, who earned a cybersecurity degree from Florida Polytechnic in 2018, soon found himself with access to serious government secrets at DIA, which he joined in 2019. He eventually had not only a Top Secret clearance but was also read in to various \"special access programs\"—some of the government's deepest secrets. He appears to have been relatively gruntled about his work, but the political upheavals of the last decade shook his faith in what America stood for and the objectives his work was serving. By March 2025, Laatsch achieved full disgruntlement and allegedly sent an anonymous email to a \"friendly foreign government,\" offering to share classified information with them. The email said that the \"recent actions of the current administration are extremely disturbing to me... I do not agree or align with the values of this administration and intend to act to support the values that the United States at one time stood for.\" The FBI was soon \"provided with\" this email, and it quickly found out that Laatsch was not nearly as good at security as he thought he was. Let's count the \"stupid mistakes\" here: 1) REDACTION FAIL:The anonymous email included two photos showing the front and back of a US government ID card of the kind used in the intelligence community. The name and photo of the bearer were redacted.According to the FBI, however, \"through other information that was not redacted on one of the US Government IDs, law enforcement was able to determine that the US Government ID belonged to Laatsch.\" 2) EMAIL ADDRESS FAIL:The FBI quickly gained access to the \"anonymous\" email account used to send the message. They found that, on the day that this account was set up, it received a message from a second email account—possibly as a test—which turned out to be one of Laatsch's and contained his name as part of the email address. 3) EMAIL ACCOUNT FAIL:This second email account, when the FBI examined it, had been set up using Laatsch's full name, date of birth, and phone number. 4) IP ADDRESS FAIL:Both the first and second email account had been logged into from the same IP address, suggesting they were controlled by the same person. And the IP address that was used for them both resolved to... Laatsch's residence. The leaker did suggest moving the conversation to an encrypted messaging platform, but the damage was already done. The FBI immediately began a sting operation, posing as the \"friendly country,\" asking Laatsch to copy some juicy data and provide it in a \"dead drop\" at a park in northern Virginia. Laatsch allegedly then went in to work at DIA, using his deep knowledge of DIA computerized tracking systems to avoid detection by... copying secret documents into notebooks by hand, then ripping out the sheets of paper and stuffing them in his socks. This appears to have worked well enough—except for the fact that internal DIA \"video monitoring\" was watching him do it, with FBI agents noting even the ways Laatsch tried to \"hide his notebook\" when co-workers walked by. Whether Laatsch was aware of this video monitoring system is unclear. On May 1, 2025, Laatsch allegedly wrote up his notes, stored them on a thumb drive, and dropped them as requested at an Alexandria park. The drive was later retrieved by the FBI. On May 8, Laatsch told his contact that he wasn't seeking money but \"citizenship for your country\" because he didn't \"expect things here to improve in the long term, even in the event there is a change in the future.\" Laatsch wasarrested yesterday, May 29.

    "title": "Texas AG loses appeal to seize evidence for Elon Musk’s ad boycott fight",
    "article_text": "Judge notes \"irony\" in Texas AG's attempt to silence watchdog for Musk's X. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has failed to reverse a preliminary injunction currently blocking him from probing Media Matters for America (MMFA) in defense of Elon Musk's social media platform X. On Friday, a US appeals courtupheldthe injunction. In his opinion, senior Circuit Judge Harry T. Edwards wrote that there was \"ample\" evidence that Paxton \"pursued a retaliatory campaign\" against MMFA \"because they published an unfavorable article about X.com.\" And MMFA has standing to raise a First Amendment defense, because \"the First Amendment generally 'prohibits government officials from subjecting individuals to retaliatory actions after the fact for having engaged in protected speech,\" Edwards wrote. Edwards noted that the day afterX sued MMFAover reporting on antisemitic posts appearing next to big brands' ads on X—alleging the report fraudulently spawned an ad boycott—Paxton announced a broad probe into MMFA that, he confirmed in a press release, was directly due to X's lawsuit. Edwards found Paxton’s \"contention\" that MMFA's \"articles were deliberately designed to mislead consumers about X\" was \"meritless,\" noting, \"the record is utterly devoid of evidence to support such a claim.\" But Paxton claimed in the press release that he was \"extremely troubled by the allegations that Media Matters, a radical anti-free speech organization, fraudulently manipulated data on X.com\" and wanted to \"ensure that the public has not been deceived by the schemes of radical left-wing organizations who would like nothing more than to limit freedom by reducing participation in the public square.\" Seemingly intent on doing Musk's dirty work after Musk indicated it would be \"interesting\" if state attorneys general joined his\"thermonuclear\" fight, Paxton sought a wide range of MMFA documents and communications dating back to January 1, 2022. He apparently hoped to uncover facts establishing MMFA's alleged bias against X and Musk, collusion with advertisers, or funding sources, all of which might support X's claim that MMFA manipulated X with the goal of tanking the platform. Paxton also encouraged other states to join him investigating MMFA, which notably resulted in apreliminary injunction against Missouri AG Andrew Baileylast August. All of this, Edwards said, provides sufficient evidence of Paxton's retaliatory motive. If MMFA is made to endure Paxton's probe, the media company could face civil penalties of up to $10,000 per violation of Texas' unfair trade law, a fine or confinement if requested evidence was deleted, or other penalties for resisting sharing information. However, Edwards agreed that even the threat of the probe apparently had \"adverse effects\" on MMFA. Reviewing evidence, including reporters' sworn affidavits, Edwards found that MMFA's reporting on X was seemingly chilled by Paxton's threat. MMFA also provided evidence that research partners had ended collaborations due to the looming probe. Importantly, Paxton never contested claims that he retaliated against MMFA, instead seemingly hoping to dodge the lawsuit on technicalities by disputing jurisdiction and venue selection. But Edwards said that MMFA \"clearly\" has standing, as \"they are the targeted victims of a campaign of retaliation\" that is \"ongoing.\" The problem with Paxton’s argument is that\" it \"ignores the body of law that prohibits government officials from subjecting individuals to retaliatory actions for exercising their rights of free speech,\" Edwards wrote, suggesting that Paxton arguably launched a \"bad-faith\" probe. Further, Edwards called out the \"irony\" of Paxton \"readily\" acknowledging in other litigation \"that a state’s attempt to silence a company through the issuance and threat of compelling a response\" to a civil investigative demand \"harms everyone.\" With the preliminary injunction won, MMFA can move forward with its lawsuit after defeating Paxton's motion to dismiss. In her concurring opinion, Circuit Judge Karen L. Henderson noted that MMFA may need to show more evidence that partners have ended collaborations over the probe (and not for other reasons) to ultimately clinch the win against Paxton. In a statement provided to Ars, MMFA President and CEO Angelo Carusone celebrated the decision as a \"victory for free speech.\" \"Elon Musk encouraged Republican state attorneys general to use their power to harass their critics and stifle reporting about X,\" Carusone said. \"Ken Paxton was one of those AGs who took up the call, and his attempt to use his office as an instrument for Musk’s censorship crusade has been defeated.\" MMFA continues to fight against X over the same claims—as well as arecently launched Federal Trade Commission probe—but Carusone said the media company is \"buoyed that yet another court has seen through the fog of Musk’s ‘thermonuclear’ legal onslaught and recognized it for the meritless attack to silence a critic that it is,\" Carusone said. Paxton's office did not immediately respond to Ars' request to comment. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "article_text": "The HopeJR will compete with Unitree's G1 and other early offerings. Hugging Face is best known as a platform for machine learning and AI development, but it has also been dabbling in the world of robotics. This week, the company revealed two new robots it plans to bring to market—including a humanoid one that it would sell for around $3,000, far less than many of the other options that have been floated, like Unitree's $16,000 G1. Dubbed the HopeJR, Hugging Face's robot has up to 66 actuated degrees of freedom. According to Hugging Face Principal Research Scientist Remi Cadene, it can walk and manipulate objects. As shown ina short X video, it has an accessible look that reminds us a bit of Bender fromFuturama. (It's the eyes.) Co-designed with French robotics company The Robot Studio, HopeJR will be open source. \"The important aspect is that these robots are open source, so anyone can assemble, rebuild, [and] understand how they work, and [they’re] affordable, so that robotics doesn’t get dominated by just a few big players with dangerous black-box systems,\" Hugging Face CEO Clem Delanguetold TechCrunch. You may have noticed he said \"robots\" plural—that's because there's a second one. It's called Reachy Mini, and it looks like a cute, Wall-E-esque statue bust that can turn its head and talk to the user. Among other things, it's meant to be used to test AI applications, and it'll run between $250 and $300. You can sort of think of these products as the equivalent to a Raspberry Pi, but in robot form and for AI developers—Hugging Face's main customer base. Hugging Face has previously released AI models meant for robots, as well as a 3D-printable robotic arm. This year, it announced an acquisition of Pollen Robotics, a company that was working on humanoid robots. Hugging Face's Cadene came to the company by way of Tesla. For context on the pricing, Tesla's Optimus Gen 2 humanoid robot (while admittedly much more advanced, at least in theory) is expected to cost at least $20,000. There is a lot of investment in robotics like this, but there are still big barriers—and price isn't the only one. There's battery life, for example; Unitree's G1 only runs for about two hours on a single charge. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Why incels take the “Blackpill”—and why we should care",
    "article_text": "A growing number of incels are NEET (Not in Education, Employment, or Training). That should concern us all. The online incel (\"involuntary celibate\") subculture is mostly known for its extreme rhetoric, primarily against women, sometimes eruptinginto violence. But a growing number of self-identified incels are using their ideology as an excuse for not working or studying. This could constitute a kind of coping mechanism to make sense of their failures—not just in romantic relationships but also in education and employment, according toa paperpublished in the journal Gender, Work, & Organization. Contrary to how it's often portrayed, the \"manosphere,\" as it is often called, is not a monolith. Those who embrace the \"Redpill\" ideology, for example, might insist that women control the \"sexual marketplace\" and are only interested in ultramasculine \"Chads.\" They champion self-improvement as a means to make themselves more masculine and successful, and hence (they believe) more attractive to women—or at least better able to manipulate women. By contrast, the \"Blackpilled\"incelcontingent is generally more nihilistic. These individuals reject the Redpill notion of alpha-male masculinity and the accompanying focus on self-improvement. They believe that dating and social success are entirely determined by one's looks and/or genetics. Since there is nothing they can do to improve their chances with women or their lot in life, why even bother? \"People have a tendency to lump all these different groups together as the manosphere,\" co-author AnnaRose Beckett-Herbert of McGill University told Ars. \"One critique I have of the recent Netflix showAdolescence—which was well done overall—is they lump incels in with figures like Andrew Tate, as though it's all interchangeable. There's areas of overlap, like extreme misogyny, but there are really important distinctions. We have to be careful to make those distinctions because the kind of intervention or prevention efforts that we might direct towards the Redpill community versus the Blackpill community might be very different.\" Incels constitute a fairly small fraction of the manosphere, but the vast majority of incels appear to embrace the Blackpill ideology, per Beckett-Herbert. That nihilistic attitude can extend to any kind of participation in what incels term \"Soyciety\"—including educational attainment and employment. When that happens, such individuals are best described by the acronym NEET (Not in Education, Employment, or Training). \"It's not that we have large swaths of young men that are falling into this rabbit hole,\" said Beckett-Herbert. \"Their ideology is pretty fringe, but we're seeing the community grow, and we're seeing the ideology spread. It used to be contained to romantic relationships and sex. Now we're seeing this broader disengagement from society as a whole. We should all be concerned about that trend.\" The NEET trend is also tied to the broader cultural discourse on how boys and young men are struggling in contemporary society. While prior studies tended to focus on the misogynistic rhetoric and propensity for violence among incels, \"I thought that the unemployment lens was interesting because it's indicative of larger problems,\" said Beckett-Herbert. \"It's important to remember that it's not zero-sum. We can care about the well-being of women and girls and also acknowledge that young men are struggling, too. Those don't have to be at odds.\" Beckett-Herbert and her advisor/co-author, McGill University sociologist Eran Shor, chose the incels.is platform as a data source for their study due to its ease of public access and relatively high traffic, with nearly 20,000 members. The pair used Python code to scrape 100 pages, amounting to around 10,000 discussion threads between October and December 2022. A pilot study revealed 10 keywords that appeared most frequently in those threads: \"study,\" \"school,\" \"NEET,\" \"job,\" \"work,\" \"money,\" \"career,\" \"wage,\" \"employ,\" and \"rot.\" (\"They use the phrase 'lie down and rot' a lot,\" said Beckett-Herbert.) This allowed Beckett-Herbert and Shor to narrow their sample down to 516 threads with titles containing those keywords. They randomly selected a subset of 171 discussion threads for further study. That analysis yielded four main themes that dominated the discussion threads: political/ideological arguments about being NEET; boundary policing; perceived discrimination; and bullying and marginalization. Roughly one-quarter of the total comments consisted of political or ideological arguments promoting being NEET, with most commenters advocating minimizing one's contributions to society as much as possible. They suggested going on welfare, for instance, to \"take back\" from society, or declared they should be exempt from paying any taxes, as \"compensation for our suffering.\" About 25 percent—a vocal minority—pushed back on glorifying the NEET lifestyle and offered concrete suggestions for self-improvement. (\"Go outside and try at least,\" one user commented.) Such pushback often led to boundary policing. Those who do pursue jobs or education run the risk of being dubbed \"fakecels\" and becoming alienated from the rest of the incel community. (\"Don't work for a society that hates you,\" one user commented.) \"There's a lot of social psychological research on groupthink and group polarization that is relevant here,\" said Beckett-Herbert. \"A lot of these young men may not have friends in their real life. This community is often their one source of social connection. So the incel ideology becomes core to their identity: 'I'm part of this community, and we don't work. We are subhumans.'\" There were also frequent laments about being discriminated against for not being attractive (\"lookism\"), both romantically and professionally, as well as deep resentment of women's increased presence in the workplace, deemed a threat to men's own success. \"They love to cherry-pick all these findings from psychology research [to support their position],\" said Beckett-Herbert. For instance, \"There is evidence that men who are short or not conventionally attractive are discriminated against in hiring. But there's also a lot of evidence suggesting that this actually affects women more. Women who are overweight face a greater bias against them in hiring than men do, for example.\" Beckett-Herbert and Shor also found that about 15 percent of the comments in their sample concerned users' experiences being harassed or bullied (usually by other men), their mental health challenges (anxiety, depression), and feeling estranged or ostracized at school or work—experiences that cemented their reluctance to work or engage in education or vocational training. Many of these users also mentioned being autistic, in keeping with prior research showing a relatively high share of people with autism in incel communities. The authors were careful to clarify, however, that most people with autism \"are not violent or hateful, nor do they identify as incels or hold explicitly misogynistic views,\" they wrote. \"Rather, autism, when combined with other mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and hopelessness, may make young men more vulnerable to incel ideologies.\" There are always caveats. In this case, the study was limited to a single incel forum, which might not be broadly representative of similar discussions on other platforms. And there could be a bit of selection bias at play. Not every incel member may actively participate in discussion threads (lurkers) and non-NEET incels might be less likely to do so either because they have less free time or don't wish to be dismissed as \"fakecels.\"However, Beckett-Herbert and Shor note that their findings are consistent with previous studies that suggest there are a disproportionately large number of NEETs within the incel community. Is effective intervention even possible for members of the incel community, given their online echo chamber? Beckett-Herbert acknowledges that it is very difficult to break through to such people. \"De-radicalization is a noble, worthy line of research,\" she said. \"But the existing evidence from that field of study suggests that prevention is easier and more effective than trying to pull these people out once they're already in.\" Potential strategies might include fostering better digital and media literacy, i.e., teaching kids to be cognizant of the content they're consuming online. Exposure time is another key issue. \"A lot of these young people don't have healthy outlets that are not in the digital world,\" said Beckett-Herbert \"They come home from school and spend hours and hours online. They're lonely and isolated from real-world communities and structures. Some of these harmful ideologies might be downstream of these larger root causes. How can we help boys do better in school, feel better prepared for the labor market? How can we help them make more friends? How can we get them involved in real-world activities that will diminish their time spent online? I think that that can go a long way. Just condemning them or banning their spaces—that's not a good long-term solution.\" While there are multiple well-publicized instances of self-identified incels committing violent acts—most notablyElliot Rodger, who killed six people in 2014—Beckett-Herbert emphasizes not losing sight of incels' fundamental humanity. \"We focus a lot on the misogyny, the potential for violence against women, and that is so important,\" she said. \"You will not hear me saying we should not focus on that. But we also should note that statistically, an incel is much more likely to commit suicide or be violent towards themselves than they are toward someone else. You can both condemn their ideology and find it abhorrent and also remember that we need to have empathy for these people.\" Many people—women especially—might find that a tall order, and Beckett-Herbert understands that reluctance. \"I do understand people's hesitancy to empathize with them, because it feels like you're giving credence to their rhetoric,\" she said. \"But at the end of the day, they are human, and a lot of them are really struggling, marginalized people coming from pretty sad backgrounds. When you peruse their online world, it's the most horrifying, angering misogyny right next to some of the saddest mental health, suicidal, low self-esteem stuff you've ever seen. I think humanizing them and having empathy is going to be foundational to any intervention efforts to reintegrate them. But it's something I wrestle with a lot.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Testing a robot that could drill into Europa and Enceladus",
    "article_text": "We don't currently have a mission to put it on, but NASA is making sure it's ready. Europa and Enceladus are two ocean moons that scientists have concluded have liquid water oceans underneath their outer icy shells. The Europa Clipper mission should reach Europa around April of 2030. If it collects data hinting at the moon’s potential habitability, robotic lander missions could be the only way to confirm if there’s really life in there or not. To make these lander missions happen, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory team has been working on a robot that could handle the search for life and already tested it on the Matanuska Glacier in Alaska. “At this point this is a pretty mature concept,” says Kevin Hand, a planetary scientist at JPL who led this effort. There are only a few things we know for sure about conditions on the surface of Europa, and nearly all of them don’t bode well for lander missions. First, Europa is exposed to very harsh radiation, which is a problem for electronics. The window of visibility—when a potential robotic lander could contact Earth—lasts less than half of the 85 hours it takes for the moon to complete its day-night cycle due to the Europa-Jupiter orbit. So, for more than half the mission, the robot would need to fend for itself, with no human ground teams to get it out of trouble. The lander would also need to run on non-rechargeable batteries, because the vast distance to the Sun would make solar panels prohibitively massive. And that’s just the beginning. Unlike on Mars, we don’t have any permanent orbiters around Europa that could provide a communication infrastructure, and we don’t have high-resolution imagery of the surface, which would make the landing particularly tricky. “We don't know what Europa's surface looks like at the centimeter to meter scale. Even with the Europa Clipper imagery, the highest resolution will be about half a meter per pixel across a few select regions,” Hand explains. Because Europa has an extremely thin atmosphere that doesn’t provide any insulation, the temperatures on top of its ice shell are estimated to vary between minus-160° Celsius during the daytime maximum and minus-220° C during the night, which means the ice the lander would be there to sample is most likely hard as concrete. Hand’s team, building their robot, had to figure out a design that could deal with all these issues. The work on the robotic system for the Europa lander mission began more than 10 years ago. Back then, the 2013–2022decadal strategy for planetary sciencecited the Europa Clipper as the second-highest priority large-scale planetary mission, so a lander seemed like a natural follow-up. The robot developed by Hand’s team has legs that enable it to stabilize itself on various types of surfaces, from rock-hard ice to loose, soft snow. To orient itself in the environment, it uses a stereoscopic camera with an LED light source for illumination hooked to computer-vision algorithms—a system similar to the one currently used by the Perseverance rover on Mars. “Stereoscopic cameras can triangulate points in an image and build a digital surface topography model,” explains Joseph Bowkett, a JPL researcher and engineer who worked on the robot’s design. The team built an entirely new robotic arm with seven degrees of freedom. Force torque sensors installed in most of its joints act a bit like a nervous system, informing the robot when key components sustain excessive loads to prevent it from damaging the arm or the drill. “As we press down on the surface [and] conduct drilling and sampling, we can measure the forces and react accordingly,” Bowkett says. The finishing touch was the ICEPICK, a drilling and sampling tool the robot uses to excavate samples from the ice up to 20 centimeters deep. Because of long periods the lander would need operate without any human supervision, the team also gave it a wide range of autonomous systems, which operate at two different levels. High-level autonomy is responsible for scheduling and prioritizing tasks within a limited energy budget. The robot can drill into a sampling site, analyze samples with onboard instruments, and decide whether it makes sense to keep drilling at the same spot or choose a different sampling site. The high-level system is also tasked with choosing the most important results for downlink back to Earth. Low-level autonomy breaks all these high-level tasks down into step-by-step decisions on how to operate the drill and how to move the arm in the safest and most energy-efficient way. The robot was tested in simulation software first, then indoors at JPL’s facilities, and finally at the Matanuska Glacier in Alaska, where it was lowered from a helicopter that acted as a proxy for a landing vehicle. It was tested at three different sites, ranked from the easiest to the most challenging. It completed all the baseline activities as well as all of the extras. The latter included a task like drilling 27 centimeters deep into ice at the most difficult site, where it was awkwardly positioned on an eight-to-12-degree slope. The robot passed all the tests with flying colors. And then it got shelved. Hand’s team put their Europa landing robot through the Alaskan field test campaign between July and August 2022. But when the newdecadal strategyfor planetary science came out in 2023, it turned out that the Europa lander was not among the missions selected. The National Academies committee responsible for formulating these decadal strategies did not recommend giving it a go, mainly because they believed harsh radiation in the Jovian system would make detecting biosignatures “challenging” for a lander. An Enceladus lander, on the other hand, remained firmly on the table. “I was also on the team developingEELS, a robot intended for a potential Enceladus mission, so thankfully I can speak about both. The radiation challenges are indeed far greater for Europa,” Bowkett says. Another argument for changing our go-to ocean world is that water plumes containing salts along with carbon- and nitrogen-bearing molecules have already been observed on Enceladus, which means there is a slight chance biosignatures could be detected by a flyby mission. The surface of Enceladus, according to the decadal strategy document, should be capable of preserving biogenic evidence for a long time and seems more conducive to a lander mission. “Luckily, many of the lessons on how to conduct autonomous sampling on Europa, we believe, will transfer to Enceladus, with the benefit of a less damaging radiation environment,” Bowkett told Ars. The dream of a Europa landing is not completely dead, though. “I would love to get into the Europa’s ocean with a submersible and further down to the seafloor. I would love for that to happen,” Hand says. “But technologically it’s quite a big leap, and you always have to balance your dream missions with the number of technological miracles that need to be solved to make these missions possible.” Science Robotics, 2025.  DOI:10.1126/scirobotics.adi5582 Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "After Supreme Court loss, ISPs ask Trump admin to block state affordability laws",
    "article_text": "New York mandates $15 low-income plans; other states may impose similar laws. Broadband lobby groups asked the Trump administration to block state laws that require Internet service providers to offer cheap plans to people with low incomes. The biggest lobby groups for the cable, telecom, and mobile industries made the request in afilingwith the US Department of Justice this week. The groups want Trump's Justice Department to sue states such as New York, which requires ISPs to offer broadband for$15 or $20 a monthto people who meet income eligibility requirements. \"The Antitrust Division should work with other components of the Department of Justice to consider bringing affirmative preemption litigation against the harmful state laws already on the books or soon enacted—particularly those that directly regulate broadband rates,\" the lobby groups said. The lobby groups also said the Justice Department should collaborate with the Federal Communications Commission \"to thoroughly examine every possible tool in the federal government's toolbox, including any and all ways in which the Commission can take regulatory action to preempt harmful state regulations.\" The filing was submitted by CTIA-The Wireless Association, NCTA-The Internet & Television Association, and USTelecom-The Broadband Association. The groups made the submission to the Justice Department's new Anticompetitive Regulations Task Force, which itcreated\"to advocate for the elimination of anticompetitive state and federal laws and regulations that undermine free market competition and harm consumers, workers, and businesses.\" The Trump administration task force asked for public comments on state and federal laws that should be eliminated. A Justice Department lawsuit against states wouldn't necessarily get ISPs what they want. The lobby groups already sued New York themselves andlostin a federal appeals court. The Supreme Courtrefused to hearthe groups' challenge in December 2024 andrejected a follow-up requestby the ISPs in February. New York'slawrequires ISPs with over 20,000 customers in the state to offer $15 broadband plans with download speeds of at least 25Mbps, or $20-per-month service with 200Mbps speeds.ISPs fearedthat their court loss would lead many other states to impose similar requirements, and some states are now considering legislation modeled on New York's. A California bill wouldrequire$15 plans with download speeds of 100Mbps and upload speeds of 20Mbps. The broadband lobby groups' filing said ISPs are also worried about \"unnecessary anticompetitive regulations\" proposed in Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and West Virginia. Not all the pending state bills are specifically about prices charged to low-income users. Some would impose net neutrality requirements or classify ISPs as utilities, the filing said. Preempting state laws while simultaneously avoiding federal regulation has been a long-held dream for the broadband industry. During the first Trump administration, then-FCC Chairman Ajit Pai led a vote to eliminate the FCC's net neutrality rules and preempt all 50 states from passing their own net neutrality laws. But the FCC's broadpreemption attempt failedin court. When challenging the New York affordability mandate, ISPs claimed the state law was preempted by the Pai FCC's decision to deregulate broadband. But this argument failed for the same reason that Pai's earlier preemption attempt failed—the FCC decision to deregulate removed the FCC's strongest regulatory authority over broadband, and courts have ruled that the FCC cannot preempt state laws in an area that it is not regulating. The Pai FCC's \"order stripped the agency of its authority to regulate the rates charged for broadband Internet, and a federal agency cannot exclude states from regulating in an area where the agency itself lacks regulatory authority,\" the US Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuitsaidin the ruling that upheld New York's law last year. ISPs still aren't giving up on the argument, as they hope a court might someday rule differently. The lobby groups' filing reminded the Department of Justice that during the first Trump administration, the governmentbrought a preemption suitagainst California's net neutrality law. \"The Department unfortunately dropped out of the litigation after the change in Administration,\" the filing said. \"But as then-Attorney General [Jeff] Sessions explained in initiating the action, California had 'enacted an extreme and illegal state law attempting to frustrate [the] federal policy' of an unfettered market for broadband, and the Justice Department had a 'duty to defend the prerogatives of the federal government and protect our Constitutional order.'\" ISPs kept challenging the California net neutrality law well into the Biden administration butcouldn't find any judgeswho would vote to overturn it. They say the wave of state legislation currently under consideration would be more harmful to their businesses than California's net neutrality law. \"Many of the state laws that are now being enacted are far more intrusive than the California law the Department challenged in 2018. These new state broadband regulations are flatly illegal under established preemption principles,\" the filing said. With multiple federal courts having ruled that the state laws are not preempted by existing US laws and regulations, ISPs' best chance at preemption is probably for Congress to implement a nationwide preemption law. ISPs claim that states are defying Congress' will as specified in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, whichsaidthat it \"is the policy of the United States... to preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists for the Internet and other interactive computer services, unfettered by Federal or State regulation.\" ISPs told the Justice Department that this was \"an intentional and preemptive decision by Congress to embrace the free market\" that is now being thwarted by states \"adopt[ing] their own utility-style regulations of broadband.\" But the ISPs' filing doesn't point to any US law that would specifically preempt the New York affordability mandate or similar proposals being considered in other states. Even if the US doesn't bring lawsuits against states that impose new mandates on broadband providers, the industry itself will continue to file such cases. The lobby groups' filing asked the Justice Department to support those lawsuits even if the Trump administration doesn't file any itself. \"The Department should defend Congress's carefully calibrated judgment that the Internet 'has flourished,' and will continue to flourish 'to the benefit of all Americans, with a minimum of government regulation,'\" the filing said. \"At a minimum, if the Department does not ultimately decide to pursue litigation itself, it should support challenges by industry throughamicusbriefs or statements of interest.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "article_text": "Workspace users will be seeing a lot more of Google's AI summaries soon. Using Google products in 2025 means using (or avoiding) AI features, which are becoming a core part of the experience across the board. Last year, Gmail gained the ability tosummarize emailson demand. Now, Google says AI summaries will be generated and displayed automatically in the Gmail app for Android and iOS. Before this latest change, you had to tap the \"Summarize this email\" chip at the top of the screen to generate an AI summary of the message contents.Google has decidedto make this automatic for emails \"where a summary is helpful.\" That means messages that are longer or threads that contain multiple replies. The announcement is a bit vague about how much detail will trigger a summary, but it probably won't take much, as Google wants people interacting with AI features as much as possible. Gmail's AI summaries use Gemini to generate a brief list of bullet points that break down the content of the thread. It appears at the top of the app, which may not be ideal. In the same way that AI Overviews appear at the top of search results andpush the actual search results farther out of reach, Gmail's AI summaries take up valuable real estate at the top of the screen. The summaries will appear automatically for English-language emails, but it may take up to 15 days for this change to roll out to everyone. The automatic summaries will appear for all paid Workspace accounts, as well as individual accounts with Google AI Premium subscriptions. It's unclear whether standard Gmail accounts will get the expanded summaries, but the move appears to be a step toward making summaries the default for everyone. Likewise, Google could easily expand the use of summaries in the web version of Gmail at any time. Summarizing content is one of the more judicious applications of generative AI technology, dating back to the 2017 paper on the transformer architecture. Generative AI has since been employed to create chatbots that will seemingly answer any question, despite their tendency to make mistakes. Grounding the AI output with a few emails usually yields accurate results, but do you really need a robot to summarize your emails? Unless you're getting novels in your inbox, you can probably just read a few paragraphs. If you're certain you don't want any part of this, there is a solution. Automatic generation of AI summaries is controlled by Gmail's \"smart features.\" You (or an administrator of your managed account) candisable that. Open the app settings, select the account, and uncheck the smart features toggle. For most people, Gmail's smart features are enabled out of the box, but they're off by default in Europe and Japan. When you disable them, you won't see the automatic AI summaries, but there will still be a button to generate those summaries with Gemini. Be aware that smart features also control high-priority notifications, package tracking,Smart Compose,Smart Reply, andnudges. If you can live without all of those features in the mobile app, you can avoid automatic AI summaries. The app will occasionally pester you to turn smart features back on, though.

    "article_text": "The glitch lasted a few hours but caused traffic jams on alternate routes. On Thursday, a Google Maps glitch accidentally made it appear that the most desirable routes on German autobahns and highways were shut down, The Guardianreported. It remains unclear what exactly unleashed a flood of stop signs on Google Maps in the area just ahead of a four-day holiday break when many drivers had travel plans. Maps of roadways in Belgium and the Netherlands were also affected. In ganz DeutschlandChaos bei Google Maps: Dienst zeigt unzählige falsche Sperrungenhttps://t.co/qEfIRrIHx3 If drivers had stopped to check alternative apps, they would have learned that traffic was flowing normally and may have avoided clogging traffic on alternative routes or wasting time speculating about what could have happened to close so many major roads. Apple Maps and Waze accurately charted traffic patterns, and only Google Maps appeared to be affected. Instead, Google Maps loyalists learned the hard way that Google doesn't know everything, as the misinformation reportedly caused traffic jams rather than helping drivers avoid them. Some drivers trusted Google so much that they filed reports with police to investigate the issue, with some worrying that a terrorist attack or government hack may have occurred. On social media, others vented about what they assumed was correct information about supposed closures, The Guardian reported, with one person fuming, \"They can’t have closed ALL the motorways!\" Another joked that the Google Maps glitch made it look like the autobahn system was suffering \"an acne outbreak.\" Ars contacted Google to see if the glitch's cause has been uncovered. A spokesperson remained vague, only reiterating prior statements that Google \"investigated a technical issue that temporarily showed inaccurate road closures on the map\" and has \"since removed them.” Apparently, Google only learned of the glitch after users who braved the supposedly closed roads started reporting the errors, prompting Google to remove incorrect stop signs one by one. Engadgetreportedthat the glitch only lasted a couple of hours. Google's spokesperson told German media that the company wouldn't comment on the specific case but noted that Google Maps draws information from three key sources: individual users, public sources (like transportation authorities), and third-party providers. It wasn't the first time that German drivers have encountered odd roadblocks using Google Maps. Earlier this month, Google Maps \"incorrectly displayed motorway tunnels\" as closed in another part of Germany, MSNreported. Now, drivers in the area are being advised to check multiple traffic news sources before making travel plans. While Google has yet to confirm what actually happened, one regional publicationnotedthat the German Automobile Club, Europe's largest automobile association, had warned that there may be heavy traffic due to the holiday. Google's glitch may have been tied to traffic forecasts rather than current traffic reports. Google alsorecently addedartificial intelligence features to Google Maps, which could have hallucinated the false traffic jams. This story was updated on May 30 to include comment from Google.

    "article_text": "The modeling estimates don't account for other costs, like parents' lost work. Once hailed as a triumph of public health, water fluoridation is now under intense attack in the US. Despite decades of data proving its efficacy at protecting teeth from decay—particularly children's teeth—two states have now banned the use of fluoride in public water, and communities around the country have followed suit or are considering doing the same. The current US health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is known for his anti-vaccine advocacy and for peddling conspiracy theories, has pledged to remove fluoride from US water. Now, a pair of researchers at Harvard—Sung Eun Choi and Lisa Simon—have modeled exactly what will happen in the US if Kennedy follows through on his pledge: The number of cavities and decayed teeth in American children and teens (ages 0–19) will increase by an estimated 7.5 percentage points over the first five years. That means there will be 25.4 million more rotten teeth in the mouths of children and teenagers. The dental bills for the added decay will total at least $9.8 billion in that time. Other costs, such as loss of work among parents, were not included, making the financial estimate conservative. But children will also be more miserable, with an estimated loss of 2.9 million quality-adjusted life years. After 10 years, the number of additional decayed teeth would be 53.8 million at a cost of $19.4 billion. The analysis,published Friday in JAMA Health Forum, drew from real-world dental utilization and oral health data from a national health survey. It also modeled tooth decay as a function of age, sex, race, ethnicity, and income. The model was calibrated against real dental decay prevalence. Costs for dental work were based on standard rates from the American Dental Association, insurance claims, and prior analyses. In all, the increased decay and boosted dental costs would disproportionately affect children who are in low-income families, in rural areas, and/or on public health insurance. The study's findings are likely unsurprising to those in the public health community, who have consistently supported fluoridation. The practice, however beneficial, has a long history of being under attack. After its introduction in the US in 1945, conspiracy theorists claimed fluoridation was a communist plot and a form of government mind control. More recently, critics have claimed that fluoridation lowers IQ. The data linking water fluoridation to low IQ is controversial. Many of the studies on the topic are of poor quality and have numerous confounding factors and flawed methods. Many compare IQ levels in communities in China and other countries, where there are areas with water that is naturally high in fluoride—much, much higher than what is intentionally added to US water. Further,a federal meta-analysis—a type of study that aggregates and reanalyzes data from independent studies—has been plagued by criticism for bias, poor statistical methods, and a lack of data transparency. But despite the controversy, one thing is clear in all the data and debate: Any possible association with low IQ and fluoridation only occurs at excessive levels—levels more than twice the amount used in the US and recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC recommendation for water fluoridation levels is 0.7 mg/L, while potential harms are not observed until water levels exceed 1.5 mg/L. Some areas in China have natural levelsas high as 11.8 mg/L. The authors of the new study conclude that, at current US levels, the benefits are clear. \"These findings suggest that, despite the potential harms of excessive fluoride exposure, fluoridation at safe levels offers both individual and societal benefits that would be at risk.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "2025 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 first drive: Engineered for insane speed",
    "article_text": "Now that Chevrolet can fit turbos to the Corvette, it's gone and done just that. AUSTIN, Texas—By just my third lap in the top-spec 2025 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1, I glanced down at the speedometer toward the end of the Circuit of the Americas' long back straight and spied 181 mph (291 km/h) displayed for a split second. Not bad for Chevy’s newest flagship sports car, especially given that the $174,995 ZR1’s twin-turbocharged V8 pumps all 1,064 horsepower to the rear wheels only. The US’s only purpose-built F1 track made for an excellent setting to taste Corvette’s latest; the ZR1 also commanded your attention while conquering the steep uphill toward the first corner, then winding through a series of challenging corners with plenty of elevation change. Luckily, the car itself is an engineering marvel, and Chevy brought along a team of engineers to explain exactly how the total package comes together to enable such a breathtaking pace, as well as how Chevy can responsibly sell such a powerful car to the general public at all. The entire point of switching the Corvette’seighth generation to a mid-engine layoutwas to improve weight distribution and allow the Corvette to compete against much more exotic competition from European OEMs like Ferrari. The front-engined car's engine bay also lacked the width to add a pair of turbos, due to the suspension and tire orientation, which dictated the use of a supercharger that kept peak power to “just” 755 hp (563 kW) in the last Corvette to wear the ZR1 badge. COTA reveals the ZR1's excellent balance, especially when specced with the optional aero package, carbon fiber wheels, and Michelin’s Cup 2 R tires. The tires—in effect, grooved slicks—allow for improved lateral acceleration but also the ability to consistently put the four-figure horsepower down to the asphalt. Yet Chevy’s engineers readily admitted the original target for ZR1 was just 850 hp (634 kW), until 1,000 came into sight and required some serious creativity to reach reliably. The ZR1’s engine, dubbed LT7, shares much with the 5.5 L naturally aspirated LT6 engine in the less-powerful, cheaper Z06. It’s still a flat-plane crank with dry-sump oiling, even if clever eyes inspecting an LT6 might have noticed that the dry-sump oil tank allowed for the placement of turbos all along. The dual 76-millimeter turbos, the largest ever fitted to a production car, required new intake routing, and computer control of the wastegate actuation maintains an anti-lag boost of 6 to 7 psi even under a closed throttle. Turbo speed sensors allow the turbines to spin closer to maximum speed before the vanes physically break apart—a mechanical system typically needs to maintain a 7 percent margin of error, but the ZR1’s is more like 2–3 percent. The eventual power output actually wound up breaking two of Chevrolet’s dynos during early testing, we're told. So the C8’s eight-speed dual-clutch transmission also needed beefing up with physically wider gears that were shot-peened for additional strength, plus a revised lubrication system. The engine, meanwhile, creates enormous cooling demands when running at full throttle, which plays hand in hand with the downforce requirements of hitting such high speeds. Consequently, the ZR1 sacrifices its usable frunk in favor of a massive radiator, while the hood’s heat extractor also releases trapped air and feeds it over the roofline. This freed up more space for additional cooling via the front fascia, which further benefits from canard spat dive planes. On the sides, an additional inlet on the side strakes complements the enormously wide scoops that debuted on the Z06. Coupes then get a split rear window—which harks back to Corvettes of old, while releasing hot air from the engine bay—plus new shoulder NACA intakes that directly feed the air box with cooler oxygen that even creates a ram air effect akin to mild supercharging. Cooling for the ZR1 became an even higher priority, because the LT6 and LT7 employ extremely tight tolerances between the crankshaft and connecting rods, which mandates keeping the 5W-50 oil below 120° C (248° F) at all times. And the system simply works, as even on a hot and humid Texas day, I only noticed oil temperatures cresting above 104° C (220° F) occasionally. The hardtop convertible ZR1 lacks the split-engine venting and shoulder intakes, while cutting into headroom so much that I skipped out while wearing a helmet. Other journalists noticed a drop-off in performance for the convertibles, and probably more so than the mild weight gains of just about 100 lbs (45 kg) might suggest. Instead, temperatures probably came into play, as the ECU drew back timing and instead allowed mild overboost of 24–25 psi to compensate for the Texas day. Even so, an engineer admitted he thought the engine was probably down 5–10 percent on power. The fact that I hit my highest-ever top speed despite the ZR1 potentially giving up somewhere between 53 to 106 hp (40–80 kW) only makes this Corvettes sound even more insane. But I essentially wound up driving the turbos, since the DCT’s gear ratios carry over from the Stingray and therefore drop out of peak power when shifting from second to third and third to fourth. I suspect nothing short of an F1 racecar feels this fast on a circuit of this size. A track designed for corner exit speeds double my pace in the ZR1 helps explain why Chevrolet declined to set us loose on public roads behind the wheel. That’s a concern for potential buyers, though, and why the ZR1’s electronics undoubtedly ratchet back the insanity. Chevy still uses Bosch’s ninth-generation traction control, which debuted on C7 and operates on a 10-millisecond loop, even if the ABS runs at 5 milliseconds—while the ESC is at 20 milliseconds. I suspect this computerized nannying slowed me down a fair amount, in addition to the torque-by-gear restrictions in first and second that purposefully protect driveline components. We’ve probably reached peak internal-combustion Corvette, which is something of a hint about the all-too-real question of where Chevy can go from here. If so, this car reaches a new level of unfathomable American ingenuity, combined with a newfound level of refinement and traction management that attempts to belie the undeniable absurdity to a minimal, arguably necessary, extent.

    "title": "Elon Musk counts the cost of his four-month blitz through US government",
    "article_text": "Term at DOGE did serious damage to his brands, only achieved a fraction of hoped-for savings. Elon Musk’s four-month blitz through the US government briefly made him Washington’s most powerful businessman since the Gilded Age. But it has done little for his reputation or that of his companies. Musk this week formally abandoned his role as the head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), which has failed to find even a fraction of the $2 trillion in savings he originally pledged. On Thursday, Donald Trump lamented his departure but said Musk “will always be with us, helping all the way.” Yet the billionaire will be left calculating the cost of his involvement with Trump and the meagre return on his $250 million investment in the US president’s election campaign. “I appreciate the fact that Mr Musk put what was good for the country ahead of what was good for his own bottom line,” Tom Cole, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee, told the Financial Times. After Doge was announced, a majority of American voters believed Musk would use the body to “enrich himself and undermine his business rivals,” according to a survey, instead of streamlining the government. Progressive groups warned that he would be “rigging federal procurement for billionaires and their pals” and cut regulations that govern his companies Tesla and SpaceX. Democratic lawmakers said Doge was a “cover-up” of a more sinister, self-serving exercise by the world’s richest person. Early moves by the Trump administration suggested Musk might get value for money. A lawsuit brought by the Biden administration against SpaceX over its hiring practices was dropped in February, and regulators probing his brain-implant company Neuralink were dismissed. Musk’s satellite Internet business Starlink was touted by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick as a potential beneficiary of a $42 billion rural broadband scheme. An executive order calling for the establishment of a multibillion-dollar Iron Dome defense system in the US looked set to benefit Musk, due to SpaceX’s dominance in rocket launches. The gutting of various watchdogs across government also benefited Musk’s businesses, while a number of large US companies rushed to ink deals with Starlink or increase their advertising spending on X. Starlink also signed agreements to operate in India, Pakistan, and Vietnam, among other countries it has long wished to expand into. But while Doge took a scythe to various causes loathed by Musk, most notably international aid spending and government contracts purportedly linked to diversity initiatives or “woke” research, it also caused severe blowback to the billionaire’s businesses, particularly Tesla. At one point during his Doge tenure, Tesla’s stock had fallen 45 percent from its highest point last year, and reports emerged that the company’s board of directors had sought to replace Musk as chief executive. The 53-year-old’s personal wealth dropped by tens of billions of dollars, while his dealerships were torched and death threats poured in. Some of the brand damage to Tesla, until recently Musk’s primary source of wealth, could be permanent. “Eighty percent of Teslas in the US were sold in blue zip codes,” a former senior employee said. “Obviously that constituency has been deeply offended.” Starlink lost lucrative contracts in Canada and Mexico due to Musk’s political activities, while X lost 11 million users in Europe alone. Probes of Tesla and SpaceX by government regulators also continued apace, while the Trump administration pressed ahead with plans to abolish tax credits for electric vehicles and waged a trade war vehemently opposed by Musk that threatened to further damage car sales. In the political arena, few people were cheered by Doge’s work. Democrats were outraged by the gutting of foreign aid and by Musk’s 20-something acolytes gaining access to the Treasury’s payment system, along with the ousting of thousands of federal workers. Republicans looked askance at attempts to target defense spending. And true budget hawks were bitter that Musk could only cut a few billion dollars. Bill Gates even accused Musk of “killing the world’s poorest children” through his actions at Doge. Musk, so used to getting his way at his businesses, struggled for control. At various points in his tenure he took on Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Transport Secretary Sean Duffy, and trade tsar Peter Navarro, while clashing with several other senior officials. Far from being laser-focused on eliminating waste, Musk’s foray into government was a “revenge tour” against a bureaucracy the billionaire had come to see as the enemy of innovation, a former senior colleague of Musk’s said, highlighting the entrepreneur’s frustration with COVID-19 regulations in California, his perceived snub by the Biden administration, and his anger over his daughter’s gender transition. Trump’s AI and crypto tsar, David Sacks, an influential political voice in the tech world, “whipped [Musk] up into a very, very far-right kind of mindset,” the person added, to the extent that was “going to help this administration in crushing the ‘woke’ agenda.” Neither Musk nor Sacks responded to requests for comment. Musk, who claimed Doge only acted in an “advisory role,” this week expressed frustration at it being used as a “whipping boy” for unpopular cuts decided by the White House and cabinet secretaries. “Trump, I think, was very savvy and allowed Doge to kind of take all those headlines for a traditional political scapegoat,” said Sahil Lavingia, head of a commerce start-up who worked for Doge until earlier this month. Musk, he added, might also have been keen to take credit for the gutting of USAID and other moves but ultimately garnered unwanted attention. “If you were truly evil, [you] would just be more quiet,” said Lavingia, who joined the initiative in order to streamline processes within government. “You would do the evil stuff quietly.” The noise surrounding Musk, whose ability to dominate news cycles with a single post on his social media site X rivaled Trump’s own hold on the headlines, also frustrated the administration. This week, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller took to X to indirectly rebut the billionaire’s criticism of Trump’s signature tax bill, which he had lambasted for failing to cut the deficit or codify Doge’s cuts. Once almost synonymous with Musk, Doge is now being melded into the rest of government. In a briefing on Thursday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that following Musk’s departure, cabinet secretaries would “continue to work with the respective Doge employees who have onboarded as political appointees at all of these agencies.” She added: “The Doge leaders are each and every member of the President’s Cabinet and the President himself.” Doge’s aims have also become decidedly more quotidian. Tom Krause, a Musk ally who joined Doge and was installed at Treasury, briefed congressional staff this week on improvements to the IRS’s application program interfaces and customer service, according to a person familiar with the matter. Other Doge staffers are doing audits of IT contracts—work Lavingia compares with that done by McKinsey consultants. Freed from the constraints of being a government employee, Musk is increasingly threatening to become a thorn in Trump’s side. Soon after his Doge departure was announced, he again criticized the White House, this time over its plan to cancel clean energy tax credits. “Teddy Roosevelt had that great adage: ‘speak softly but carry a big stick’,” Fred Thiel, the chief executive of Bitcoin mining company MARA Holdings, told the FT. “Maybe Elon’s approach was a little bit different.” © 2025 The Financial Times Ltd.All rights reserved.Not to be redistributed, copied, or modified in any way.

    "title": "Blue Origin boss: Government should forget launch and focus on “exotic” missions",
    "article_text": "\"There's not yet a commercial reason only to go to the Moon with humans.\" Eighteen months after leaving his job as a vice president at Amazon to take over as Blue Origin's chief executive, Dave Limp has some thoughts on how commercial companies and government agencies like NASA should explore the Solar System together. Limp had no background in the space industry before taking the helm of Jeff Bezos' space company in December 2023. He started his career as a computer scientist at Apple, took a stint at a venture capital firm, andjoined Amazon in 2010, where he managed development of consumer devices like Alexa, Kindle, and the Fire TV. \"I had no thoughts of ever running a space company,\" Limp said Thursday at a space conference in Washington, DC. \"I've done consumer electronics my whole life. Started at Apple and did a bunch of other things, and so when I decided to retire from Amazon, I was looking for something that I could give back a little bit, be a little bit more philanthropic in the sort of second half of my career. I didn't want to stop working, just wanted to do something different. And about that same time, Jeff was looking for a CEO.\" While he's still a relative newcomer to the space business, Limp's views align with those of many policy wonks and industry leaders who have the ears of senior officials in the Trump administration, including Jared Isaacman, President Trump's nominee to become the next NASA administrator. Limp's long tenure at Amazon and his selection as Blue Origin's new CEO demonstrate that he also has the trust of Bezos, who was dissatisfied with his company's slow progress in spaceflight. \"I think Jeff convinced me, and he's very persuasive, that Blue didn't need another rocket scientist,\" Limp said. \"We have thousands of the world's best rocket scientists. What we needed was a little bit more decisiveness, a little bit more ability to think about: How do we manufacture at scale? And those are things I've done in the past, and so I've never looked back.\" In remarks Thursday at theHumans to the Moon & Mars Summit, Limp advocated for commercial companies, like his own, taking a larger role in developing the transportation and infrastructure to meet lofty national objectives established by government leaders. In some ways, NASA has long been moving in this direction, beginning with initiatives ceding most launch services to private industry in the 1990s. More recently, NASA has turned to commercial companies for crew and cargo deliveries to the International Space Station and cargo and human-rated Moon landers. However, NASA, with the backing of key congressional leaders, has held an iron grip on having its own heavy-lift launcher and crew capsule to ferry astronauts between Earth and destinations beyond low-Earth orbit. Now, these vehicles—the Space Launch System and Orion spacecraft—may be canceled if Congress agrees withTrump's proposed NASA budget. Commercial rockets close to matching or exceeding the Space Launch System's lift capability are available for purchase or likely will be soon. These includeSpaceX's Starship mega-rocketandBlue Origin's New Glenn launcher. Both are already key elements of NASA's Artemis program, which aims to land US astronauts on the Moon as a stepping stone toward human expeditions to Mars. But NASA still plans to use its government-owned Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft to transport astronauts out to the Moon, where they will rendezvous with a Starship or Blue Origin's Blue Moon lander to fly to and from the lunar surface. SLS and Orion are expensive vehicles, costing more than $4 billion per launch for the initial set of four Artemis missions, according to a report by NASA's inspector general. While commercial companies like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman build elements of SLS and Orion, NASA acts as the prime integrator. The agency signed cost-plus contracts with the companies building SLS and Orion, meaning the government is on the hook for cost overruns. And there have been many. NASA's robotic science probes are also getting more expensive, even when accounting for inflation. Given the way NASA procures science probes, it would cost NASA more today to send an orbiter to Mars than it did for a similarly sized spacecraft a quarter-century ago. This has to change in order for NASA and private companies like Blue Origin and SpaceX to make their ambitions a reality, Limp said Thursday. \"I think commercial folks can worry about the infrastructure,\" he said. \"We can do the launch. We can build the satellite buses that can get you to Mars much more frequently, that don't cost billions of dollars. We can take a zero, and over time, maybe two zeros off of that. And if the governments around the world leave that to the commercial side, then there are a lot more resources that are freed up for the science side, for the national prestige side, and those types of things.\" Limp followed these comments with a dose of realism you don't often hear from space industry executives. While there's a growing list of commercially viable markets in space (things like Starlink and satellite servicing wouldn't have been money-makers 20 years ago), the market for human spaceflight still requires some level of government commitment. \"I think the thing about bringing commercial aspects to exploration, to science, to the Moon, to Mars, is that we have to see a business prospect for it,\" Limp said. \"We have to turn it into a business, and that benefits American taxpayers because we will use that capital as efficiently as we can to get to the Moon, to get to Mars in a safe way, but in a way that's the most efficient. \"We're committed to that, no matter what the architecture looks like, but it does take the US government and international governments to have the motivation to do it,\" he continued. \"There's not yet a commercial reason only to go to the Moon with humans. There are lots of commercial reasons to put robotics on the Moon and other types of things. So, we do need to have conviction that the Moon is important and Mars is important as well.\" Trump and Musk, an ally and advisor to the president, rekindled the question of Moon or Mars in a series of remarks during the early weeks of the new Trump administration. The Artemis Moon program began during the first Trump administration, with the goal of returning astronauts to the Moon for the first time since 1972. NASA would establish a sustained presence at the Moon, using our nearest planetary body as a proving ground for the next destination for humans in Solar System exploration: Mars. SpaceX's Starship, while capable of one day landing on the Moon, was designed for long-duration cruises to Mars. Blue Origin's Blue Moon is tailored for lunar landings. “As an American, I don't want another Sputnik moment,\" Limp said. \"From my standpoint, getting boots on the Moon and setting the groundwork for permanence on the Moon is of national importance and urgency. Rest assured, Blue will do everything in its power to try to make that happen, but in a cost-effective way.\" Since retaking office in January, Trump has mentioned human missions to Mars multiple times, but not the Moon. Isaacman, who may be confirmed as NASA administrator by the Senate as soon as next week,told lawmakers in Aprilthat the agency should pursue human missions to the Moon and Mars simultaneously. The details of how that might work haven't been released but could come out in the White House's detailed budget proposal for fiscal-year 2026. Ablueprint of Trump's spending proposalreleased May 2 includes a 25 percent cut to NASA's overall budget, but the plan would provide additional money for human space exploration at the Moon and Mars. \"The budget funds a program to replace SLS and Orion flights to the Moon with more cost-effective commercial systems that would support more ambitious subsequent lunar missions,\" the White House budget office wrote. This part of the budget request is not controversial for industry leaders like Limp. On the other hand, the budget blueprint proposes slashing NASA's space science budget by nearly $2.3 billion, Earth science by almost $1.2 billion, and space technology by $531 million. While Limp didn't directly address these budget proposals, these parts of NASA are largely focused on research projects that lack a commercial business case. Who else but a government space agency, or perhaps an especially generous type of philanthropic multi-billionaire, would pay to send a probe to study Jupiter's icy moon Europa? Or a robot to zip by Pluto? Or how about amission like Landsat, which documents everything from water resources to farms and urban sprawl and makes its data freely available to anyone with an Internet connection? Most experts agree there are better ways to do these things. Reusable rockets, mass-produced satellite platforms, and improved contracting practices can bring down the costs of these missions. Bezos' long-term goal for Blue Origin, which is to move all polluting factories off the Earth and into space, will be easier to achieve with government support, not just funding, Limp said. “Getting up there, building factories on the Moon is a great step, and the government can really help with research dollars around that,\" he said. \"But it still does need the labs. The science missions need theJPLs [Jet Propulsion Laboratory]of the world. To make the human experience right, we need the Johnson Space Centers of the world to be able to kind of use that gold mine of institutional knowledge. \"I would say, and it might be a little provocative, let's have those smart brains look on the forward-thinking types of things, the really edge of science, planning the really exotic missions, figuring out how to get to planetary bodies we haven't gotten to before, and staying there,\" Limp said. For the first decade after Bezos founded Blue Origin in 2000, the company operated under the radar and seemed to move at a glacial pace. It launched its first small rocket in 2006 to an altitude of less than 300 feet and reached space with the suborbital New Shepard booster in 2015. Blue Origin finally reached orbit in January of this year on the debut test flight of its heavy-lift New Glenn rocket. Meanwhile, Blue Origin inked a deal with United Launch Alliance to supply a version of its New Glenn main engine to power that company's Vulcan rocket. The next big mission for Blue Origin will be the first flight of its Blue Moon lander. The first version of Blue Moon, called MK1, will launch on a New Glenn rocket later this year and attempt to become the largest spacecraft to ever land on the Moon. This demonstration, without anyone onboard, is fully funded by Blue Origin, Limp said. A future human-rated version, called MK2, is under development with the assistance of NASA. It will be larger and will require refueling to reach the lunar surface. Blue Moon MK1 can make a landing on one tank. These are tangible achievements that would be the envy of any space industry startup not named SpaceX. But Musk's rocket company left Blue Origin in the dust as it broke launch industry records repeatedly and began delivering NASA astronauts to the International Space Station in 2020. My colleague, Eric Berger,wrote a story in Januarydescribing Blue Origin's culture. For much of its existence, one former employee said, Blue Origin had \"zero incentive\" to operate like SpaceX. To ensure he would be in lock-step with his boss, Limp felt he had to ask a question that was on the minds of many industry insiders. He got the answer he wanted. \"The only question I really asked Jeff when I was talking about taking this job was, 'What do you want Blue to be? Is it a hobby, or is it a business?'\" Limp said. \"And he had the right answer, which is, it's a business, because I don't know how to run a hobby, and I don't think it's sustainable.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

Originally built by Masten Space Systems, the suborbital Xodiac rocket had flown 175 successful missions before a flight from Mojave, California, on Wednesday. But now, it will fly no more. \"While the vehicle remained within its planned flight envelope, it detected an anomalous condition and commanded a flight termination,\"said Astrobotic, which acquired Masten a couple of years ago. \"This resulted in a rapid descent and caused a loss of the vehicle upon impact with its launch pad.\" Now entering the Xogdor waiting room... There were no injuries or significant damage to the company's infrastructure in Mojave. The vehicle is essentially a hopper and has been used in recent years by various customers, including companies building commercial lunar landers, to test their hazard-detection systems. Astrobotic has been working on a larger version of Xodiac, which it is calling Xogdor. Chinese firm tests Grasshopper-like rocket. Chinese private rocket firm Space Epoch said Thursday it had successfully run a flight recovery test,Reuters reports. Beijing-based Space Epoch, or SEPOCH, said its Yuanxingzhe-1 verification rocket was launched at 4:40 am from a sea-based platform off the waters of the eastern province of Shandong. The rocket soared upward, its engines briefly shutting down after the peak of its trajectory, then reigniting as it began its vertical descent to enter the Yellow Sea in a circle of fire, a video posted on Space Epoch's WeChat account showed. Chasing the Falcon 9... The flight lasted 125 seconds, reaching a height of about 2.5 km (1.6 miles), the company said.

Based upon the information in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company is considering both a suborbital and orbital launch capability for small satellites, which would fly to space on a small rocket deployed from the F-4 Phantom. In my experience, air-based launch systems always seem like a better idea on paper than in reality. Perhaps there is some potential for hypersonics here, but I would be shocked to ever see a satellite launched into orbit from a fighter jet. (submitted by Biokleen) Rocket Lab acquires Geost. Rocket Lab is expanding deeper into the defense sector with the acquisition of Geost, a supplier of electro-optical and infrared sensor payloads used in US military satellites,Space News reports. In a deal announced Tuesday, Rocket Lab will acquire Geost from the private equity firm ATL Partners for $125 million in cash and $150 million in stock, with an additional $50 million in potential cash payments tied to revenue targets in 2026 and 2027. Seeking mil money... The acquisition gives Rocket Lab access to satellite sensor technology used by the US Department of Defense for missile-warning systems and space surveillance—capabilities that could help it win lucrative Pentagon contracts. \"The acquisition of Geost will bring on board critical technology and payloads that are relied upon by the Department of Defense,\" said Rocket Lab’s chief executive, Peter Beck. Rocket Lab has been seeking to expand its military contracts in recent years, and this move is consistent with that. Northrop names rocket, invests in Firefly. Northrop Grummanannounced Thursdaythat it is investing $50 million into Firefly Aerospace to further development of a medium-lift rocket. The company also revealed that the rocket will be named \"Eclipse.\" The rocket will be capable of launching up to 16,300 kg of cargo to low-Earth orbit or 3,200 kg of cargo to geosynchronous transfer orbit, and initially it will likely be used for Cygnus cargo missions to the International Space Station. A match made in heaven? ... Eclipse will use the same first stage Firefly is developing for the Northrop Grumman Antares 330 rocket. Both launch vehicles will use seven of Firefly’s Miranda engines. The new rocket is expected to make its debut no earlier than 2026 (and, if history is any guide, probably later). \"Eclipse gives customers the right balance of payload capacity and affordability,\" Northrop Vice President Wendy Williams said in a statement. \"Our partnership with Firefly builds on our capacity to provide crucial space-based communication, observation, and exploration for civil and national security customers.\" China launches asteroid mission. A Chinese spacecraft built to collect specimens from an unexplored asteroid and return them to Earth launched Wednesday from a military-run spaceport in the country's mountainous interior,Ars reports. The liftoff aboard a Long March 3B rocket from the Xichang launch base kicked off the second mission in a series of Chinese probes to explore the Solar System. This mission, designated Tianwen-2, follows the Tianwen-1 mission, which became the first Chinese spacecraft to land on Mars in 2021. Sending samples home... China has two objectives for Tianwen-2. First, Tianwen-2 will fly to a near-Earth asteroid designated 469219 Kamoʻoalewa, or 2016 HO3. Once there, the spacecraft will retrieve a rocky sample from the asteroid's surface and bring the material back to Earth in late 2027 for analysis in labs. After the spacecraft releases its sample carrier to land on Earth, Tianwen-2 will change course and head to a mysterious comet-like object found between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Next Kuiper launch gets a June date. United Launch Alliancesaid Thursdaythat an Atlas V rocket will launch its second batch of Amazon's Project Kuiper satellites next month. The Atlas V 551 rocket launch is planned for 2:29 pm ET on June 13 from Space Launch Complex-41, pending range approval. A speedy turnaround... Amazonalso confirmedthat it has finished processing the Kuiper satellites for the launch, saying all 27 spacecraft have been integrated onto the rocket. Getting to space in June with this mission will mark an impressive turnaround from Amazon, given that its KA-01 mission, also with 27 Internet satellites, launched on April 28. SpaceX set to launch another GPS satellite. SpaceX is gearing up to launch a Global Positioning System satellite for the US military on Friday from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, marking another high-profile national security mission that shifted from United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan to the Falcon 9 rocket,Space News reports. The launch of GPS III SV-08—the eighth satellite in the GPS III constellation—was originally assigned to United Launch Alliance but was switched to SpaceX as the military prioritizes getting advanced anti-jamming capabilities into orbit as quickly as possible. Gotta go fast... This marks the second consecutive GPS III satellite to be switched from ULA to SpaceX, following December’s launch of GPS III SV-07. ULA’s Vulcan, which received certification to launch national security missions, continues to face delays and has accumulated a backlog of military launches. In a press call this week, Space Force officials said the mission was executed on an unusually accelerated timeline. Launch planning for GPS III SV-08 kicked off in February, with Lockheed Martin receiving a formal request on February 21 and SpaceX following on March 7, just under three months ahead of liftoff. That’s an extraordinary pace for a national security launch, they said, which typically takes 18 to 24 months from contract award. Another Starship launch, another second-stage issue. SpaceX made some progress on another test flight of the world's most powerful rocket Tuesday, finally overcoming technical problems that plagued the program's two previous launches,Ars reports. But minutes into the mission, SpaceX's Starship lost control as it cruised through space, then tumbled back into the atmosphere somewhere over the Indian Ocean nearly an hour after taking off from Starbase, Texas, the company's privately owned spaceport near the US-Mexico border. During the rocket's two previous test flights—each using an upgraded \"Block 2\" Starship design—problems in the ship's propulsion system led to leaks during launch, eventually triggering an early shutdown of the rocket's main engines. Not great, not terrible... On both flights, the vehicle spun out of control and broke apart, spreading debris over an area near the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands. The good news is that that didn't happen on Tuesday. The ship's main engines fired for their full duration, putting the vehicle on its expected trajectory toward a splashdown in the Indian Ocean. For a short time, it appeared the ship was on track for a successful flight. The bad news is that Tuesday's test flight revealed more problems, preventing SpaceX from achieving the most important goals Musk outlined going into the launch, including testing Starship's reentry tiles. Elon Musk talks Starship version 3. Inan interview with Ars Technica, SpaceX founder Elon Musk said he expects that an upgraded version of Starship—essentially Block 3 of the vehicle with upgraded Raptor engines—should fly before the end of the year. The business end of the rocket will have a sleek look: \"The upgraded Raptors have a complete redesign of the aft end of the booster and the ship,\" Musk said. \"So, because we don't need the heat shield around the upper portion of the engine, it greatly simplifies the base of the booster and the ship. It'll look a little, frankly, naked, especially on the booster side, because the engines will just be there, like, not with stuff around them.\" A difficult upgrade to work through... \"This is a design change that I really had to push the team very hard to do, to get rid of any secondary structure, and any parts that could get burned off because there will be no heat shield,\" Musk added. \"So it'll be very clear when we have a Raptor 3. Version 3 of the Ship and Booster has quite a radical redesign.\" Given the challenges that version 2 of Starship has faced with its recent flights, an upgrade in the overall design appears to be much-needed.

    "title": "Marvel Will Skip San Diego Comic-Con’s Hall H Again This Year",
    "article_text": "Doctor Doom isalready destroying thingsin the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He’s got his eyes set on the Fantastic Four, Avengers, and now with his movie,Avengers: Doomsday,having been pushed until December 2026, he’s taken a big bite out of San Diego Comic-Con too. Marvel Studios won’t have one of itssignature Hall H panels this year. The news was first reported by theHollywood Reporterwhich io9 then confirmed with a source at Marvel Studios. The reasoning is all pretty understandable.Avengers: Doomsdaywas supposed to come out in May 2026 but is now coming out in December 2026. That means there will be a whole other Comic-Con before its release. With the cast now filming that movie, the studio must have felt like it simply couldn’t deliver on the blockbuster panels of the past. And so, it’s taking the year off. This isn’t the first time Marvel Studios has skipped Hall H either. In 2011, 2015, 2018, and2023, the studio skipped becauseeither movies were too busy with production or there simply wasn’t enough concrete news to share in order to live up to the studio’s standard. And make no mistake,Marvel has high standards when it comes to Hall H. Anytime there is a panel, it becomes the biggest event of the weekend, and after last year’s panel that culminated in the reveal of theRussos coming backfor twoAvengersmovies, as well as Robert Downey Jr. as Doctor Doom, that would’ve been a hard to follow no matter what. So that’s the case here. There’s just one movie in production, which was already delayed to give the filmmakers more time, so taking a week off to promote a movie 18 months away without footage certainly seems excessive. Especially when it could come back next year with footage, cast members, and maybe even news about what the future holds, too. That’s not to say Marvel won’t be at Comic-Con at all in 2025. Other branches of the company will have panels for comics, games, and moreâand withThe Fantastic Four: First Stepsopening in theaters during Comic-Con, there will be a large presence on the convention floor, including an immersive booth. Marvel is also promising “other surprises,” which could mean almost anything. Don’t forget, last year,Deadpool & Wolverineopened during Comic-Con so the studio showed the movie in Hall H. Maybe that could happen again? Plus, fans looking for Marvel convention news won’t have to wait long. It’ll be at CCXP in Mexico this weekend with news and footage on Fantastic Four. Are you bummed Marvel won’t be at Hall H this year? Do you expect to DC to fill that slot? Let us know below. Want more io9 news?

    "article_text": "io9 recently sat down withHow to Train Your DragonfilmmakerDean DeBloisto chat about being the steward of DreamWorks and Universal Pictures’ dragon franchise. In our conversation, when discussing how awesome it was to see Gerard Butler reprise his role as Hiccup’s dad Stoic, we brought up other actors we’d like to see reprise roles or cameo in live-action, including original stars Jay Baruchel, America Ferrera, and Cate Blanchett. DeBlois revealed to io9 that he hopes Academy Award winner Cate Blanchett will reprise her role as Valka in theannounced upcoming live-action adaptation ofHow to Train Your Dragon 2. “We are keeping our fingers crossed,” he said, “But yeah, I don’t know… it’s a little early to tell because I’m just writing the script.â Fans of the animated film know how big of a deal it would be to see Blanchett return to the franchise in the pivotal role. It’s an early reveal in the sequel that Hiccup’s mom Valka, who is mentioned a few times in the live-action film, is alive. And it’s a twist that propels the stakes in the animated sequel which picks up five years after the events of the first film. Like Butler, Blanchett could easily slip back into the role and give us another undisputed fantasy genre queen performance to followThe Lord of the Rings‘ Galadriel andThor: Ragnarok‘s Hela. However, we will note that Blanchett has recently talked about wanting to retire, telling theRadio Timeslast month she has stopped referring to herself as anactress: âItâs because Iâm giving upâ¦ My family roll their eyes every time I say it, but I mean it. I am serious about giving up acting. [There are] a lot of things I want to do with my life.â As far as the original Hiccup and AstridâJay Baruchel and America Ferreraâcoming back, that would have to be more of a cameo situation. They’re older than the characters they played, and Hiccup and Astrid were re-cast with Mason Thames and Nico Parker for the live-action movie. âWe’ll see what happens. Jay and America have been really supportive; in fact they weighed in on the casting when I was down to my top three Astrids and Hiccups. I shared them [with Jay and America], just to hear what they had to say, so they’ve been super supportive,” DeBlois said. “But I think for their schedules it just wouldnât work out for this movie, but maybe in the future.â How to Train Your Dragonopens June 13.

    "title": "You Might Catch the Northern Lights This Weekend If You Live in One of These States",
    "article_text": "A geomagnetic storm is predicted to hit Earth tonight after the Sun hurled a massive solar flare in our direction. Aside from a potential radio blackout, the storm may also bring with it a dazzling display of aurora borealis over parts of North America. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)forecastÂ that the Northern Lights will appear in North America on Friday night and last from Saturday night into early Sunday morning. Sky watchers in northern Canada and Alaska have the highest chances of seeing the auroral display, while parts of northeastern Washington, northern Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, northern Minnesota, Upper Michigan, northern Wisconsin, and northern Maine have a smaller chance of spotting it. NOAA’s aurora prediction appears on a forecast, or view line, map, showing the brightness and location of the aurora as a green oval centered on Earthâs magnetic pole. The green areas shift to red where the aurora is expected to be more intense. Geomagnetic storms can trigger auroras on Earth when radiation from the Sun interacts with the planet’s atmosphere, producing large light displays in the sky. Earth has recently been hit by a surge of strong solar events, including solar flares and coronal mass ejections, as the Sun reaches solar maximumâa period of heightened activity in its 11-year cycle. Just this week, a strong G3 storm on Wednesdaytriggeredauroras across parts of the U.S., followed byanotherG3 on Thursday. The Northern Lights cannot be seen during daylight hours. Instead, nature’s light show is best seen between the hours of 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. You should also head to a high, north-facing vantage point to be able to spot them, and try to get as far away as possible from any sources of artificial light. In order to be prepared for this weekend, check outNOAA’s 30-minute forecast page, which provides a 30 to 90 minute forecast of the location and intensity of the auroras. auroraaurora borealisNorthern Lights Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

A surprise solar storm also came with a baffling phenomenon that left people in the inland U.S. scratching their heads. Scientists used cameras aboard NASA's Perseverance rover to capture unprecedented views of the Red Planet's green glowing sky. An uncommon double solar eruption has sent two coronal mass ejections towards Earth, which are expected to arrive Wednesday. Captured by Webb, it's the first direct evidence of auroras on the most distant planet from the Sun. A newly compiled dataset of nearly one billion images of auroras is helping researchers categorizeâand perhaps ultimately anticipateâthe Northern Lights. A fresh outburst from the Sun may trigger auroras in parts of the northern United States and Canada. We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.Â©2025 GIZMODO USA LLC.

    "title": "Trump Admits ‘Elon’s Really Not Leaving’ During DOGE Press Conference",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump held a bizarre press conference with Elon Musk in the Oval Office of the White House on Friday, ostensibly to wave goodbye to the leader of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). But both Trump and Musk essentially admitted that the billionaire oligarch wasn’t really going anywhere, at least when it comes to his influence on the federal government. “This is not the end of DOGE. This is only the beginning,” Musk said, explaining that his time as a Special Government Employee (SGE) was limited. SGEs canât legally work for more than130 daysin any 365-day period, and that period is indeed coming to an end for Musk. But these guys aren’t exactly known for following the rules, and it seems like a convenient way to lower Musk’s profile while maintaining his influence. The billionaire has apparently been getting oneveryone’s nerves, but Musk’s exit appears to be largely symbolic, given that many of the young men he’s installed throughout the government are still in their positions. And President Trump admitted as much during the press conference. “Many of the DOGE people, Elon, are staying behind too, so they’re not leaving,” Trumpsaid. “And Elon’s really not leaving. He’s going to be back and forth.” Trump gave Musk a golden key in a box, something he said he only gives to “very special people,” and rattled off a list of things DOGE had canceled, including “making mice transgender” and “Arab Sesame Street.” Musk has taken credit for cancelling countless programs he had no legal authority to cancel, including all of USAID. “I look forward to continuing to be a friend and advisor to the president, and I look forward to continuing to support the DOGE team,” Musk said. During the press conference, Musk referred to the “banal evil of bureaucracy,” a dig at the normal functions of the government that don’t benefit him. Musk is a federal contractor, and not a single dollar allocated to his companies has been cut during his tenure taking a chainsaw to the government. Researchers estimate Musk’s cuts with DOGE have killed at least300,000 peoplearound the world and will kill millions more in the coming years, as vital public health services now go unfunded. Musk, who started Trump’s second term by giving twoNazi-style salutes, tried to make jokes when asked questions by reporters and whined incessantly after someone mentioned the New York Times. Musk made a big show of denouncing the newspaper in front of Trump, saying they might have to give back their Pulitzer Prize for reporting on the president’s ties to Russia, something he referred to as the Russia hoax. Katie Miller, the wife of Stephen Miller who had been working as a spokesperson for DOGE, was spotted in the room during the press conference by a photographer for Getty Images. Miller is leaving her government role to follow Musk in the private sector, though it’s not yet clear what role she’ll be playing at any of his companies. The Millers have an odd relationship with Musk, according to reports, and people on social media have joked that it may be sexual in nature, given the way Wired magazine characterized itback in February. The official X account for the Democratic Party evenshared a photoof a hotel “cuck chair” while quote-tweeting a story about Katie Miller on Friday. The account tagged Stephen Miller in the tweet. Trump also rambled Friday about his personal grievances and “transgender for everyone,” a phrase he uses frequently on Truth Social, though it’s not clear what he means. The Trump regime has persecuted trans people in a sadistic campaign that shows no sign of ending. Musk is also an anti-trans bigot who claims that words like cisgender are slurs. Musk, who had a black eye, was often gazing at the ceiling and into the distance, sometimes rolling his neck in circles and generally acting very strangely. Asked about the black eye by a reporter, Musk joked that he wasn’t in France, a reference to a viral clip of French President Emmanuel Macron who was recently pushed in the face by his wife. Musk said that he told his 5-year-old son X to punch him in the face. “I said, go ahead, punch me in the face. And he did. Turns out even a 5-year-old punching you in the face actually does…” Musk said,trailing off. Trump laughed, asking if it was really X who had done that. The Tesla CEO confirmed that’s what happened with a laugh. “But I didn’t really feel much at the time,” Musk continued. “And then I guess it bruises up. But I was just horsing around with the kids.” The Daily MailreportedFriday that Musk had an encounter with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that turned “violent,” citing an interview with Steve Bannon. The article quotes Bannon as saying “Elon basically shoved him,” referring to the 62-year-old Bessent, though the exact timing of the confrontation wasn’t revealed. It’s not clear if Musk’s black eye may have been a result of the fight, and Bannon doesn’t say Bessent fought back, which seems like it would have been an important part of the story if that really was the explanation for Musk’s shiner. The incident and Musk’s odd behavior in the Oval Office are sure to increase speculation about Musk’s purported drug use. The New York Times published anew reporton Friday that alleges Musk has been using a number of illicit drugs, including ketamine, ecstasy, and psychedelic mushrooms. Those allegations have been long-standing ever since the Wall Street Journal reported that story inearly 2024. The real revelation from the NYT seems to be that Musk has been getting advance notice of drug tests, something he needs to do to maintain his security clearance as a federal contractor for SpaceX. NASA claimed in 2024 there has been “no evidence” of drug use by Musk, but there might be a very good reason for the lack of evidence if advance warning was given to the billionaire. Musk has previously said he is prescribed ketamine for depression, but the new report from the NYT calls into question the dosing and frequency of his use. Musk’s alleged drug use would be ironic, of course, given the way that Trump and his supporters insist the country is being overrun by drugs and drug addicts.

Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs are starting to bite. Apparently Tesla's robotaxi reveal is upon us, which is either a watershed moment for self-driving or a total flop. The SpaceX CEO outlined upcoming changes to the rocket while staying committed to a 2026 mission to the Red Planet. How many DOGE boys are still rooting around in the federal government?

    "title": "A Brief History of the ‘Galaxy Quest’ TV Show",
    "article_text": "It’s just a passing nugget in a new interview with producer Mark Johnson. But since it’s been 10 years since we first heard about a potential TV show based on themuch-loved1999 cult classicGalaxy Quest, any update at all is worth seizing upon. Speaking toDeadline, Johnson was asked about the most recent iteration of the project. In 2023, we learned it was still in the works at at Paramount+, the home ofStar Trek‘s recent TV renaissance. He couched his response in a way that also covered a TV show based on the recent Oscar-winning dramaThe Holdovers: “Both are being written, so weâll see.” At least he didn’t say “theGalaxy QuestTV show is dead in the water,” which might be what some fans had started to think. The show was first announced a decade ago; a briefVarietyarticle published April 21, 2015, wrote that “Robert Gordon, who co-wrote the DreamWorks feature with David Howard, is in negotiations to work on the TV adaptation, as are original director Dean Parisot and executive producers Mark Johnson and Melissa Bernstein.” No further details were given, but the trade speculated it would be a re-telling of the movie’s story spread out across a season of episodes. (For the three people who haven’t seenGalaxy Quest, it’s about the washed-up stars of a cult-beloved sci-fi series; aliens, believing the show to be real, recruit the actors to help win a real-life intergalactic conflict.) A few months later, in August 2015,Entertainment Weeklyreported theGalaxy QuestTV show was in development at Amazon. By 2017,comedian Paul Scheer had come aboardthe project. He spoke about it toSlashfilmthen and explained a bit more about his vision. “Right now, I just handed in my first script to Amazon, so I’m in that zone. I’m excited about it … The thing I keep on saying about it, without giving too much awayâbecause it’s going to be so long before people get to see it, I don’t want people to get too burnt out on me telling you what it’s about before it gets to that pointâ but for me, it was really important to do service to aGalaxy Queststory that gives you everything that you want and indoctrinates people who have never seen Galaxy Quest into what the fun of that world is … and also to continue the story of our original characters and have consequences from the first film.” He also noted that the show would be “mixing two casts. It’s separate kind of adventures that kind of merge, and I’m looking at this first season not as episodic, but as a serialized story. So, the only way I’ve been looking at it is, using everything from the first movie and making the reasons for everything not justâI want to avoid anything that could be viewed as a reboot for reboot’s sake. There are real reasons behind these choicesâmaybe too much so.” Talking tothe WrapÂ in 2018, Scheer said it would be a good-natured spoof not just ofStar Trek, but alsoStar Warsand nerdy fandom at large. “My pitch forGalaxy Questwas, âHow can we kind of blow this out and pay off things for the fans that loveGalaxy Quest, but more importantlyâand the thing that I really wanted to do isâappeal to the âmeâ of now. Whoâs the 18-year-old version of me that lovedGalaxy Questnow? What would they want to see? Because I think that that is a movie that we havenât really made yet: theTropic Thunderin the world of modern-day science fiction … WhenGalaxy Questcame out, it was a niche thing,Star TrekÂ fandom is a niche thing. Now it is selling out Hall H in Comic-Con, so thatâs kind of the impetus for the continuation.â That all sounded very promising, but after 2018,Galaxy Questmore or less went radio silent. Then in 2023âafter covid, but just before the summer of industry strikesâfans got a fresh update. Varietywrote that the show had shifted to Paramount+, with only Johnson still attached. That article also noted that the original push to adapt the movie had faded after the death of Alan Rickman, but he passed in early 2016âlong before Scheer, who is seemingly no longer involved, was talking about his pitch for the show. Variety’s 2023 story said Paramount+ and Paramount Television Studios were “in the nascent stages of adapting the cult classic comedy film into a television show.” It also noted “there have [since 2015] been various writers attached to the project, though none of their versions have ultimately gone forward.” Today’s Deadline interview with Johnson notes that Paramount Television Studios is no more, but by Grabthar’s Hammer, theGalaxy QuestTV show is seemingly still holding on. If there are any future developments besides the fact that it’s “being written,” we will certainly keep you posted.

    "title": "Haunting Deep-Sea Footage Reveals U.S. Submarine Lost During WWI",
    "article_text": "On December 17, 1917, the U.S. Navy submarine USSF-1, crashed off the coast of San Diego. Now, more than a century later, researchers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI) have collected the first high-definition visuals of the wreckage. During a series of seven dives conducted earlier this year, researchers employed the crewed underwater vehicleAlvinand autonomous underwater vehicleSentry, both based on the WHOI research shipAtlantis,to snap close-ups of the sunken submarine. Since 1917,ÂF-1has been resting approximately 1,300 feet (400 meters) underwater. A Navy underwater vehiclelocatedit by accident in the 1970s, but this expedition is the first to capture detailed images of the lost sub. TheF-1wasbuiltin 1901 and launched in 1911. The crash occurred during a training mission, during which theF-1collided with another submarine, sinking in mere seconds. Nineteen crew members lost their lives, but five escaped and survived. By the time of the 1917 crash, the U.S. had been at war with theCentral powersfor seven months. âAdvanced ocean technology and simple teamwork played a big part in delivering these new images,â Bruce Strickrott, manager of theAlvinGroup at WHOI and the subâs senior pilot who helped lead the expedition, said in astatement. “Once we identified the wreck and determined it was safe to dive, we were able to capture never-before-seen perspectives of the sub.” The team used multi-beam sonar systems onAtlantisandSentryto produce maps of theF-1and surrounding areas. Then, high-resolution cameras onÂAlvinpicked up photos and videos of the wreck. The researchers stitched these images together to create detailed 3D photogrammetric models. The images showed that theF-1is lying on the seafloor on its starboard (right) side, facing northwest, and is âremarkably intact,â Strickrott toldLive Science. The researchers left the war grave site untouched, however, “to preserve its condition and be respectful of its legacy,â Bradley Krueger, an underwater archaeologist for the Naval History and Heritage Command who participated in some of the dives, told Live Science. During the series of dives, the researchers also surveyed a Navy torpedo bomber training aircraft that crashed nearby in 1950. The dives were part of a training and engineering mission to provide theAlvinpilots with experience controlling the submersible and employing deep-sea imaging technologies. The research was conducted as a collaboration between the U.S. National Science Foundation, University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System and the U.S. Navyâs Office of Naval Research and Naval History and Heritage Command. After the dives, the researchers held a remembrance ceremony aboard theAtlantis, ringing a bell 19 times, once for each of theF-1âs crew members who died in the crash. “As a U.S. Navy veteran, it was a profound honor to visit the wreck of theF-1with our ONR and NHHC colleagues aboardAlvin,”ÂStrickrott said in a statement.

Users of the online platform Polymarket have bet more than $220,000 on whether the OceanGate submersible with five passengers would be found before Friday.

    "title": "Lego’s June Releases Tremble Before Galactus",
    "article_text": "Summer is well and truly upon us, and what better way to beat the heat than to be inside building Lego based on the movies you could beÂoutin that heat going to watch? Afterlast month’sÂStar Warsbonanza, in June Lego’s opening up to a whole host of other franchises to get in on the fun with new sets, including the very firstÂFantastic FourLego set, a return toÂFortnite, and yes… the arrival of the world’s most famous Australian dog. LegoÂBlueyis arguably going to beÂthebig drop of the month, but it is one among many highlights in a bumper month for Lego. The aforementionedFantastic Four: First Stepsset finally brings Marvel’s first family to the physical world of Lego, theJurassic Worldline is all in onÂRebirthahead of its arrival in cinemas, and LegoÂSimpsonsmakes a triumphant return. But that’s not all, there’s plenty to tempt your wallet this monthâand yes, even a little moreStar Wars, too. Check out the lowdown on the biggest Lego releases of June 2025 below! This month Lego is launching a new line of designs featuring a series of foldout display pieces that can also serve as themed book nooks in your shelf space. So far the company is sticking to novel-themed ideas, like the debut Sherlock Holmes set and aÂLord of the Ringsencounter between Gandalf and the Balrog (albeit inspired by its rendition in the Peter Jackson films), but who’s to say where the line goes from here? The kids cartoon sensation is now ready to bring Australian dominion to the world of Lego too, with a series of sets explicitly aimed at young builders in both the Duplo series and Lego’s 4+ sets (although the young-at-heart adultBlueyfans will no doubt find some enjoyment with the latter, too). Whether you want something small with Bluey and her friends, or the whole Heeler household in one set, there’s plenty for everyone. Lego City is usually only in io9’s proverbial wheelhouse when it comes to the line’s myriad space exploration sets, but this new tower display is a celebration of all sorts of aspects of Lego Cityâspace included! There’s a rocket launch, a train, mirrored police and fire stations, a construction crane, and even a skate ramp for good measure. It’s a peculiar mashup, but a fun way to make a Lego City set that reflects much of the line’s mainstays. ($210, availablehere) Star Warsgot all the fun last month, but that doesn’t mean there’sÂnothingfrom the galaxy far, far away coming in June. It is a smorgasbord of smaller sets though, from a Plo Koon microfighter, a Darth Maul mini-mech, and anÂAhsoka-inspired battle pack that gives you a squad of Night Troopers to add to your legions. Rebirthis the name of the game this month in the land ofÂJurassic World, with a whole host of sets inspired by the new movie. The time is now for your Jonathan Bailey minifigure! But honestly, the star of the show might be the smallest set on offer: the adorable Dolores, a baby Aquilops. The Lego Art series expands with an original artpiece, recreating a dazzling tiger head surrounded by florals, which can be customized or even enhanced with flowers from the Lego botanicals range. ($65, availablehere) The firstÂFantastic Four: First Stepsset (and firstFantastic Fourset outright!) might be the draw here, despite Mr. Fantastic’s distressing legs, but it’s not the only Marvel set we’re getting this month, as Iron Spider swings into the Marvel bust line. After a brief bout ofÂMinecraft Moviemania, Lego’s back to the regular gaming-inspired sets for the survival crafter, with a variety of builds. The standout, however, is a wonderfully pixelated buildable Creeperâwho is not only about as articulated as a Creeper can get, but even can have TNT hidden in its head for an explosive easter egg. Lego returns toÂThe Simpsonsfor the first time in a decade with another iconic Springfield locale in the form of Krusty Burger. Alongside most of the Simpsons family in Homer, Bart, and Lisa (complete with an appropriate clown-car variant of the family car from Homer’s tenure in Clown College), there’s a host ofÂSimpsonsstalwarts, including Sideshow Bob, a new Krusty farmer inspired by the season 20 episode “Coming to Homerica”, and, of course, the squeaky-voiced teen. ($210, availablehere) Lego’s ongoing digital-physical collaboration withÂFortnitecontinues with a series of sets inspired by theÂFortniteLego Odyssey mode, including a giant-sized Klombo beast. There’s only one bit of Stitch-adjacent fever from Lego this month to tie-into the new movie in the form of a buildable Angel, Stitch’s cutesy companion from the mid-aughts TV show, but the standout is a huge buildable (and customizable) Dalmatian pup from101 Dalmatians. Check the price tag before attempting to buy 101 of them, though. Disney-adjacent, but actually from Lego’s crowdsourced Ideas series, this adorable replica of the iconic Pixar mascot from the studio’s very first short even includes the iconic Pixar ball too, packed with hidden references to a litany of animated classicsâplus, you can even pose Luxo Jr. balancing on it for good measure.

    "title": "A Definitive ‘Jaws’ Documentary Is Coming Very Soon—Here’s the Trailer",
    "article_text": "In the history of movies, only a select few have hadan impact likeJaws. Impact that doesn’t just reverberate through film history, but culture at large.Jawssupercharged the careers of iconic directorSteven Spielberg, composerJohn Williams, and others, giving us so much magic in the decades that followed. It changed the way Hollywood made and marketed movies and inspired an entire new generation to make movies themselves. Plus, who hasn’t had the movie on their mindas they tiptoe into the ocean? All of that and so much more promise to be part of a brand new documentary coming this summer, and it’s completely official. Directed by Spielberg’s longtime collaborator Laurent Bouzereau (Music by John Williams,Timeless Heroes), the 90-minute documentary is calledJaws @ 50: The Definitive Inside Story. It’s premiering on July 10 on National Geographic as part of Sharkfest and will debut the next day on Disney+, Hulu, and Nat Geo. Spielberg’s Amblin Documentaries produced it in conjunction with Wendy Benchley, a renowned shark and ocean advocate, who also happened to be married to the late, great, author ofJaws, Peter Benchley. In addition to Spielberg and Benchley, the film promises a who’s who of people who worked on the film (such as Williams; cast members Jonathan Filley, Lorraine Gray, and Jeffrey Voorhees; Ian Shaw, the son of the late Robert Shaw;screenwriter Carl Gottlieb; and others), as well as a laundry list of superfans. Among those are J.J. Abrams, Emily Blunt, James Cameron, Cameron Crowe, George Lucas, Greg Nicotero, Jordan Peele, Steven Soderbergh, Guillermo del Toro, and Robert Zemeckis, to name a few. Here’s the trailer for the documentary, which not only teases that we’ll get to see a lot of fantastic footage from the actual production of the film, but also Spielberg diving deeper than ever before into his feelings about it. If you’ve seen any of Bouzereau’s other films with Spielberg connections, such as his documentaries onHarrison FordandJohn Williams, you know he has an incredible ability to be honest about the subjects, but also remind you why you care about them in the first place. And if you haven’t seen those, watch them ASAP. We can’t wait to see how that carries over toJaws,one of the most important movies in history. Here’s the awesome poster for the doc.

    "title": "The Films and Shows You Should Be Streaming in June 2025",
    "article_text": "A whole new era continues.For the past several years,Â our monthly column the Nerdâs Watch has been the place to find out all the best genre titles coming to the biggest streaming services. It wasnât a complete list. We just posted the titles we think youâd care about, but it was still long and frankly, hard to pick out the best of the best. Well,Âover the past few months,Âthat changed. What follows isnât a list of all the best stuff streaming on all the big streaming services. Weâve looked at all those lists and come up with a few dozen titles that we think arenoteworthy this month. Some are new,Âsome are old, but either way, weâll tell you why you should care. Or at least joke about it. So sit back, grab your remote, and get ready for the new and improved Nerdâs Watch, highlighting the best movies and shows coming to streamers this month. I usually try to keep this list organized by streamer, but sometimes, you have to break tradition to get a point across.Anna and the Apocalypseis quite possibly one of my favorite, most underrated genre films in recent memory. It’s a Christmas high school zombie musical and every bit as entertaining as that sounds. Now, it loses some steam in the back half but the songs are so freaking good and characters so endearing that it’s a film I revisit often, and a soundtrack I listen to even more often. So, if you’ve never seen it, I implore you to check it out on Peacock this month. With Zach Cregger’s new movie,Weapons, opening later this summer, now is the perfect time to brush up on the film that put him on the map.Barbarianis a completely awesome and off-the-wall movie that starts in the most normal, relatable way, when two people realize they’ve been booked in the same Airbnb. But where things go from there needs to be seen to be believed. David Lynch’s take onDuneis always worth a watch but it’s even more interesting now in the wake of the Denis Villeneuve films. Lynch’s film does such a great job of telling the first part of this story, only for it to barrel through the second half with reckless abandon. It’s really something. Three of the best thrillers ever made, period, are all coming to Netflix in June, all from the same man: Alfred Hitchcock. Many would sayThe Birds,Rear Window, andVertigoare three of Hitchcock’s best, so if you’ve never seen them or just want to watch them again, now is the time. If you’ve listened to any popular music in the past 30 years, you know the work of Pharrell Williams. You may not know you know it, but you do. And seeing his story unfold, told completely with Lego animation, was some of the most fun I had watching a movie back in 2024. If you missed it, check it out. Netflix’s most popular series comes to its conclusion. Fingers crossed it sticks the landing. With the delays of the next twoAvengersmovies, new Marvel content is going to be at a premium in the coming months. And while there are a few movies scheduled, this show aboutBlack Panther: Wakanda Forevercharacter Riri Williams, now back in the U.S, is the only one coming immediately. We sincerely hope it’s good. Yes, all of them.Alien, Aliens, Alien 3, Alien Resurrection, Prometheus,andAlien Covenantare all coming to Hulu. Almost like Hulu is doing its ownAlienshow later this summer. Which, of course, it is. (Alien: Romulusis already on there too.) Yes, all of them.Preyis already on there but also now we’ll getPredator, Predator 2, Predators,andThe Predator, as well asAliens vs. PredatorandAliens vs. Predator: Requiem. Almost like there’s a newPredatormovie, or two, coming out. Which, of course, there are. Case in point… The director ofPrey, Dan Trachtenberg, has a theatrical movie coming in a few monthsâbut before that, he’s got this animated anthology showing thePredatorthroughout history. I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again. IfEdge of Tomorrow, the incredible Tom Cruise sci-fi time loop movie, is announced as returning to a streaming service, you can guarantee I’ll let you know. Every time. Independence Dayis the kind of movie we all dream about. It’s a simple, awesome concept, executed beautifully, with a scope and resonance that you remember long after the film ends. One of the most fun movies of its eraand still a certified banger. In 2025, the idea of aStar Warsspoof is almost clichÃ©.Star Warsis so incredibly prevalent in every aspect of pop culture, it seems too easy to joke about it. But in 1987, years afterReturn of the Jediand without another film anywhere near reality, Mel Brooks’ send-up of the franchise wasn’t just amazing and hilarious, it scratched a franchise itch we take for granted these days. Keeping a spoiler secret is all but impossible these days, but a few years ago, M. Night Shyamalan was able to do just that in the best possible way withSplit. Now, of course, we all know thatSplitis a sequel to the 2000 filmUnbreakableâbut that reveal, at the time,was a massive cherry on top of an already awesome, scary film. We all know Vin Diesel from theFast and Furiousmovies, but never forget he’s got at least one other really fantastic franchise:Riddick.Pitch Black, The Chronicles of Riddick,andRiddickare all coming to Peacock and they’re super moody, interesting, action-packed sci-fi spectacles. Before they shared the screen together in the upcomingBallerina, Keanu Reeves and Ana de Armas starred in this very intense, uncomfortable, but fantastic home invasion film. Not for the faint of heart, but very worth watching. Punch! That! Shit! The amazing, awesome, hilarious classicsShaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz,andThe World’s End are all coming to Peacock and there’s no better way to spend a day than in the world of Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and the crew. Yes, there is a “Jawsfranchise.” Though, to be fair, it’s notgreat. Only one of them is truly, undeniably great. But if you still want to hunt a killer shark after watching the Steven Spielberg masterpiece,Jaws 2, Jaws III,andJaws the Revengeare right there. Perfect for a nice summer day. There are tons of found footage movies out there but only a handful of really good ones. AndCloverfieldis, undoubtedly, one of those. It will always be incredibly fun to watch New York City get destroyed by a giant kaiju through the lens of a camcorder. Most of them.Raiders of the Lost Art, Temple of Doom, Last Crusade,andCrystal Skullare all popping back on Paramount for the summer, and now you don’t have to perform archeology to find them. Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Angelina Jolie star in this effects-heavy sci-fi period film that we still can’t believe exists. Nothing before it, or after it, has quite looked like it, and while the movie isn’t as wonderful as you hope it’ll be, you can’t take your eyes off it. I am not usually a huge fan of Warner Bros. DC animated films but one that I very much love isTeen Titans Go! To the Movies.It’s so fun, so funny, and so, so smart. Easily one of the best animated superhero movies we’ve seen in a long time. Before Edgar Wright and Glen Powell unleash their reimagining, check out the original Arnold Schwarzenegger sci-fi satire about a killer reality game show. Horror is hotter than ever, and that audience appetite makes a film likeInsidiousfeel even more miraculous. It’s a terrifying, original idea that did a lot of world-building and made us all want to come back again and again. Which, of course, has happened. But the first one is still the best. Aaron Paul and Eiza GonzÃ¡lez star in this new sci-fi thriller about a woman stranded on an alien planet, and the stranger who may or may not be there to save her. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "U.S. Imports Drop 19.8% in April (Yes, That’s a Record)",
    "article_text": "Imports of goods into the U.S. dropped a record 19.8% in April, according to estimates released by the U.S. Commerce Department on Friday. That drop is in sharp contrast to a 5.7% uptick of goods imported in March, widely believed to be driven by U.S. retailers and consumers buying in advance of President Donald Trump’s tariff threats, which are expected to cause prices to soar. The new estimates show that America’s trade deficit with the rest of the world narrowed by 46% to $87.6 billion, according toMarketwatch, much lower than the $143 billion projected by economists. And that should make President Trump very happy, since he’s obsessed with the trade deficit. But that’s not how any mainstream economist values the health of the U.S. economy. As countless economists have pointed out, the average consumer has a trade deficit with their barber or their local grocery store, but that doesn’t mean your barber is stealing from you, as Trump has characterized global trade relations. It just means that you’ve purchased something and, presumably, you’re better for it. President Trump first announced incredibly high tariffs onApril 2, which he dubbed “Liberation Day,” including a 10% universal tariffs across the board on all goods coming into the country. Trump’s tariffs on goods coming from China soared to 145% at one point, but that was reduced to about 30% on most goods recently after the president and negotiators from China agreed to a framework for negotiations to continue. But Trump reversed his position again on Friday, accusing China of violating the agreement without providing evidence. “Two weeks ago China was in grave economic danger!” Trump wrote on Truth SocialFriday morning. “The very high Tariffs I set made it virtually impossible for China to TRADE into the United States marketplace which is, by far, number one in the World. We went, in effect, COLD TURKEY with China, and it was devastating for them.” Trump went on to claim that “many factories” had been closed and there was “civil unrest” in China over the trade war, neither of which is true. But Trump insisted he made a deal to help China in this situation. “I saw what was happening and didnât like it, for them, not for us. I made a FAST DEAL with China in order to save them from what I thought was going to be a very bad situation, and I didnât want to see that happen,” Trump wrote. “Because of this deal, everything quickly stabilized and China got back to business as usual. Everybody was happy! That is the good news!!! The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!” Again, Trump did not explain how China had supposedly violated the deal. But U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told theWall Street Journalon Friday the administration believes China has been “reluctant” to approve exports of rare-earth materials. The president’s tariffs have not only changed based on how he’s feeling on any given dayâthey’re also currently being litigated. On Wednesday, the Court of International Trade ruled that Trump’s tariffs wereinvalidbecause only Congress has the power under the U.S. Constitution to impose tariffs. Trump argues that he has emergency powers to enact tariffs, and on Thursday an appeals court ruled the tariffs could remain while the case is heard. Trump is also trying to get his budget bill passed through the Senate, with a very ambitious goal of having it signed on July 4. But the bill, which has already passed the House, includes a $800 million cut to Medicaid and would be a handout to the wealthy, as most analysts believe. The Senate is also resistant to raising the SALT deduction, which occurred at the last minute in the House bill thanks to blue state Republicans who don’t like that constituents in higher tax states like California and New York aren’t allowed to write off more of their state and local taxes on their federal returns. The bill will also add to the federal deficit, but the White House insists the economic “growth” that will be unleashed by the bill will pay for itself in that regard. Trump whined about the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on Friday, claiming it was “controlled” by the Democrats and that its assessment of the bill didn’t account for all this promised growth. “The information they recently released is even more absurd and indefensible,” Trump wrote about the CBO estimates onTruth Social. “I predict we will do 3, 4, or even 5 times the amount they purposefully ‘allotted’ to us (1.8%) and, with just our minimum expected 3% Growth, we will more than offset our Tax Cuts (which will, in actuality, cost us no money!).” Wall Street has come up with a new acronym this week called TACO (“Trump Always Chickens Out”) a reference to the president’s habit of making wild threats about tariffs and ultimately scaling them way back. Trump was asked about TACO at a press conference this week, and it clearly got under his skin. “Don’t ever say what you said,” Trump said tothe reporter. “That’s a nasty question.” ChinaDonald TrumpeconomyTariffsTruth Social Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Worrying Covid-19 Variant Hits the U.S. Just in Time for Summer",
    "article_text": "A new variant of covid-19, NB.1.8.1, is stirring up trouble. The variant, already linked to recent surges in parts of Asia, has now been spotted in the U.S. as well. The World Health Organization singled out the growing emergence of NB.1.8.1 in itsÂlateststatus report on covid-19 Wednesday. Scientists have also recentlydetectedNB.1.8.1 in California and other states. Though NB.1.8.1 isn’t dramatically different from existing variants, the WHO warns that covid-19 remains a high public health risk. A New Covid Variant Is Rising Fast. Hereâs What We Know About NB.1.8.1 So far, fewer than 20 NB.1.8.1 cases in the U.S. have beenreported, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told NBC News this past Wednesday. But the variant is linked to a spike in cases and hospitalizations in other countries like China. And compared to other current variants, NB.1.8.1 may possess some mutations that could increase its transmissibility. The WHO first recognized NB.1.8.1 as a variant under monitoring last week, though it was first detected in late January. More recently, it’s become an increasing threat. As of mid-May, just about 10% of all cases reported worldwide to the WHO have come from NB.1.8.1 (up from 2% just four weeks earlier). Covid-19 activity in general has been on the upswing, with a worldwide test positivity rate of 11% as of May 11âa level not seen since July 2024. That said, NB.1.8.1 is genetically still within the same broad lineage of covid-19 viruses that first began with Omicron in late 2021. That means it’s very unlikely to spark the sort of massive outbreaks that Omicron initially did when it arrived. The WHO also hasn’t found any evidence yet that NB.1.8.1 is causing any more severe illness than current variants. “Evaluation of…the most recently designated VUM,Â NB.1.8.1, suggests no increased public health risk posed by these variants compared to other circulating variants,” the WHO stated in its report. But covid-19 itself still poses a very real public health problem, even if its overall danger has significantly declined since 2022. From October 2024 through May 2025, covid-19 isestimatedto have killed between 30,000 and 50,000 Americans and hospitalized up to 430,000 people, a burden on par with the average flu season. And the recent emergence of NB.1.8.1 could certainly fuel a new peak of cases in the U.S. and elsewhere, just in time for summer. Adding to the danger is rock-bottom vaccination rates as of late, even among older adults who are most vulnerable to severe illness. According to the WHO, just 1.68% of older adults across 75 countries received a booster covid-19 shot in 2024. While the original covid-19 vaccines continue to ensure a lower risk of death and severe illness from covid-19, booster doses further reduce this risk. And the situation in the U.S. isn’t looking to get better anytime soon. Under the reign of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has long spread misinformation about vaccine safety, the CDC recentlyremovedits recommendation that pregnant women and young children receive covid-19 vaccines, for instance. Trump-era health officials have alsosignaledtheir plans to only recommend covid-19 vaccines for older Americans in general, and the new regime hasalready impededthe development of newer, possibly more effective vaccines for both flu and covid-19. While covid-19 is no longer the world-shaking threat it once was, it isn’t gone, and variants like NB.1.8.1Âcould soon painfully teach us that lesson again. “As per the latest WHO global risk assessment, covering the period July-December 2024, the global public health risk associated with COVID-19 remains high,” the WHO said in its report.

Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. continues his anti-vax crusade by cancelling million-dollar bird flu vaccine deal with Moderna. A new Omicron offshoot is spreading fast across Australia and Asia, prompting renewed concerns about the covid-19 pandemic. Trials suggested the dual shot was as or more effective than separate vaccines. There's no evidence the covid-19 vaccines cause cancer. A new trial suggests a combination vaccine may offer equal or better protection against both flu and covid-19 compared to current vaccines. Even if measles vaccination rates stay the same, there could still be over 850,000 cases according to new research.

    "article_text": "One of the many, many things that makesAndorso great is that it’s uninterested in fan service. There are nogratuitous cameos. No wild, broad connections. First and foremost, creator Tony Gilroywanted to tell an emotional, impactful, and timely story ofheroism and hope, which just so happened to be in the world ofStar Wars. But that doesn’t mean other members of his team didn’t want to have a little fun, and the set and prop designers did just that. In the first season ofAndor, fans instantly noticed that Luthen Rael’s shop on Coruscant was filled with recognizable and clever winks and nods toStar Warsand Lucasfilm projects of the past. The most famous, of course, were theSankara stones fromIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, but Luthen also had Sith artifacts, Mandalorian armor, and more. All of which made sense. Luthen, after all, does deal in rare artifacts and antiquities, so he would be interested in acquiring and selling things of this nature. This season, that was taken up a notch, and theofficialStar Warswebsitehas a post breaking it down. Like, for example, Luthen has a Sith Chalice on display, much like the one Palpatine had in his office inRevenge of the Sith. There’s a Kalikori, a prized Twiâlek family heirloom, much like the one we’ve seen from the Syndullas inStar Wars Rebels. There’s a Royal Naboo headdress that looks very similar to one Queen Amidala wore in The Phantom Menace(shouldn’t Bail Organa have picked this one up to hold for his daughter?). Finally, there’s even a Gungan skull. Which Gungan? We don’t know, but I’m sure many of us have a few top choices. You can see images of those and more all over atStarWars.com. The same article also reminds us of everything fromAndorseason one, including a Jedi Temple Guard mask, like the ones fromStar Wars: The Clone Wars;a Gungan shield as seen inThe Phantom Menace; and another Naboo headpiece, this one resembling one Padme wore inAttack of the Clones. Again, Bail, why didn’t you buy these? The best part about all of this is it has nothing to do with the story. There’s no impact on Luthen and Kleya’s work in the shop. No smoking gun to solve a problem. It’s just there to remind you this story is happening in a world where all of this other stuff happened too. Both seasons ofAndorarestreaming on Disney+. You can see the above artifacts most specifically in episodes five and 10 of season two, as well as four, five, and seven of season one. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Tesla’s Robotaxi Could Self-Drive Your Faith in Autonomous Cars Right Off a Cliff",
    "article_text": "It’s been a long time coming for Tesla’s robotaxi, but it looks like the company’s firstÂtrulyÂdriverless vehicle may be ready for a road test.According to Bloomberg, Tesla is set toreveal its robotaxias soon as June 12, whichâif you have a calendar and/or a cursory concept of time and spaceâyou may note is pretty damn soon. While that reveal may be around the corner, the journey for Tesla’s robotaxi to become a real thing you can plant your butt in has been long and winding. Elon Muskâand this is trueâfirst mentioned the idea of Tesla-made robotaxisin *drumroll, please* 2016. That’s right, it’s been nearly a decade since Musk put self-driving taxis on our radar. Feel old yet? I sure do. BREAKING: Tesla launching robotaxi service in Austin on June 12thpic.twitter.com/ifV18fTSFv — Tesla Owners Silicon Valley (@teslaownersSV)May 28, 2025 While it’s impossible to say whether June 12 will for sure be the big reveal, there is at least some evidence to support that the alleged robotaxi reveal is upon us. Some people have already reported seeing Tesla robotaxis being tested on the streets of Austin, Texas, where the driverless car is supposed to be unveiled. Musk has alsotaken to X, his favorite platform for saying dubious stuff, to confirm that big things are underway in Austin and that the company has been testing self-driving Model Ys, which are allegedly “a month ahead of schedule.” For the past several days, Tesla has been testing self-driving Model Y cars (no one in driverâs seat) on Austin public streets with no incidents. A month ahead of schedule. Next month, first self-delivery from factory to customer. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk)May 29, 2025 So, maybe thisisthe moment for Tesla robotaxis. I’m leaving space for Musk to actually deliver this time. It’s hard to say for sure, but we’ll only have to wait about two weeks to find out. One thing is for damn sure, though: whenever the moment comes, it will be just thatâamoment, and a big one at that. If Tesla thinks its Full Self-Driving (FSD) beta is really ready for the big leagues, then Tesla’s robotaxi will be the real test. I personally have my doubts that FSD can deliver. Tesla’s beta, while functional in a lot of ways, has also been linked to quite a few controversies, includingtwo fatal accidents, and Autopilot, its driver-assist software, has beenlinked to hundreds of non-fatal accidentsover the past five years. That being said, I’m open to the possibility that FSD has dramatically improved over time. Tesla has pushed its software out to more and more people, which means it’s collecting more and more data that could further train and refine the software. While Tesla’s robotaxi test will likely be small at first, the stakes are still much higher since there won’t be anyone at the wheelâor at least technically.According to one Morgan Stanleyanalyst who allegedly saw a preview of the robotaxi operation, the vehicles will be heavily teleoperated, meaning there will be a human monitoring the trips and capable of intervening if need be. Even with teleoperations, though, the risks are high, not just from a human safety perspective, but also for Tesla’s reputation as a force in the self-driving world. As you may have noticed lately, Tesla, thanks in large part to Musk’s politics and general Trump brown-nosing,hasn’t really been doing so hot as a company lately,and a big flop in the self-driving arena probably won’t help that. Nor will it instill much faith in the EV company’s promise of bringing fully autonomous driving to the masses. Compounding those stakes is the fact that competitors like Waymo are nipping at Tesla’s heels, having launched their own robotaxi programs in San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and Austin. So, this is your moment, Musk, time to put all that hype to the testâor potentially crash and burn trying.

    "title": "Trump Scraps $766 Million Moderna Deal for Bird Flu Vaccine",
    "article_text": "The Trump administration has canceled a $766 million contract with Moderna for the development of a human bird flu vaccine, the pharmaceutical companyannounced Wednesday. The Biden administration signed a $176 milliondealwith Moderna last year for the development of an mRNA-based shot targeting the virus that causes bird flu, H5N1. Then, earlier this year, Bidenâs Department of Health and Human Servicesawardedthe drugmaker an additional $590 million for late-stage development of the vaccine and to support clinical trials for five additional H5N1 subtypes. Health Secretary and noted vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy hasrepeatedly expressed concernsÂ over the safety of mRNA vaccines, despite theirsaving millions of lives.Just a week ago, Moderna withdrew its application for approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for a hybrid covid-flu vaccine, said to be more effective than either shot on its own. The CDC has alsoended vaccine recommendationsfor children and pregnant women. Since 2022, over148 million birdshave been culled, and the virus has spread to other wildlife, cows, and humans. So far, H5N1 has infected 70 people in the U.S.âmost of them farmworkersâand killed one, according to the U.S.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Worldwide, the virus has a case fatality of roughly 50%, according to theWorld Health Organization. “The cancellation means that the government is discarding what could be one of the most effective and rapid tools to combat an avian influenza outbreak,” Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, toldReuters. He added that the Trump administration is taking the opposite approach to Operation Warp Speed, which it launched to combat the covid-19 pandemic. In a statement Moderna said it plans to explore alternatives for late-stage development of the vaccine. On Wednesday, the company also announced positive interim trial data for its late-stage clinical study of the shot against a subtype of H5N1. bird fluvaccinationvaccines Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

In just four weeks time, NB.1.8.1 has shot up the list of variants to be worried about, according to a new WHO report. Trials suggested the dual shot was as or more effective than separate vaccines. There's no evidence the covid-19 vaccines cause cancer. A new trial suggests a combination vaccine may offer equal or better protection against both flu and covid-19 compared to current vaccines. A new study has found that shingle vaccination is associated with a lower risk of heart attacks and other cardiovascular disease.

    "title": "If you want to play Elden Ring Nightreign in a duo, the Seamless Co-op mod is already out, dead simple to use, and it won't mess up your vanilla save",
    "article_text": "A bafflingly good mod, out less than a day after launch. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. FromSoftwareis apparently reserving the right toadd an official two-player modeto Elden Ring Nightreign⁠—right now you can only play solo or in a trio. But Yui, the modder behind theSeamless Co-opseries of Souls multiplayer hacks, has alreadydone it again with Elden Ring Nightreigna mere day after launch. PCG senior editor Wes Fenlon and I hopped in for a round, and it works exactly like you hope it would⁠—it's even slightly more buttoned up than the already-great original Seamless Co-op, won't mess up your game by drawing Easy Anticheat's Eye of Sauron, and even opens up Nightreign for further modding. To install Seamless Co-op, you just have to whack thefiles from Nexus Modsinto yourElden RingNightreign/Gamefolder. It runs from its own .exe, does not interact with FromSoft's official servers, and creates separate save files from the original game, keeping EAC out of things. That does lead to a lone hitch for you to consider, though: Any progress you've made so far won't carry into Seamless Co-op, and vice-versa. Wes and I had to chop through the tutorial Margit encounter again before queueing up. This seems to be the cost of doing business, but worth keeping in mind. Otherwise, though, it runs exactly like the official game⁠—you can even invite friends to group up through Steam still. It also worked perfectly in our run: No hitches, glitches, or connection issues to speak of. It just works. If you don't mind the split progression, have a special Elden someone in mind to play the game with, and can't stand a third wheel tagging along, this is the mod for you. I thought the first Nightlord felt easier than I remembered, but that was just 30 hours of experience talking: Yui told us that she hadn't touched difficulty balancing in any way for two-player. That may be the lone exculpatory factor in a modder whipping up a two-player mode so quickly when FromSoftware did not. In FromSoft's defense: It's still clearlyfinding the balance for Nightreign's solo mode, while Wes and I saw the potential for some lopsided, frustrating gameplay when one player goes down and the other has to revive them in a duo⁠—you no longer have the sturdy tripod of a third player taking aggro. All the same, Yui's work remains, as ever, incredibly impressive, and it'll be interesting to see how Seamless Nightreign develops, especially if FromSoft ever comes up with its own two-player solution.

    "title": "Ubisoft marks 10 years of trolling Splinter Cell fans with a new tease and I can't believe I'm saying this but they used the wrong picture of Sam Fisher",
    "article_text": "That's not Chaos Theory! When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Summer Game Fest season is almost upon us, and you know what that means. That's right, it's time forUbisoftto once again disappoint Splinter Cell fans by reminding us that it's been almost four years since the remake was announced. \"Splinter Cell fans are getting excited about a possible update on the remake in June,\"I wrote in April—except that was April 2024, not 2025, and June 2024 ultimately brought us nothing. We did hear about aSplinter Cell animated serieson Netflix, not featuring the voice of Michael Ironside, and then in November of that year theSplinter Cell movie starring Tom Hardythat was announced, appropriately, in 2012 was officially given the Sam Fisher handshake. Prior to that? The \"full remake\" of Splinter Cell was revealed in December 2021, a year later we were told it was being re-written \"for a modern day audience,\" and then a month after thatthe director quit. So, not exactly setting the world on fire there. And what do we have today? Blasted across the Ubisoft social media accounts, complete with emoji and #SplinterCell hashtag, it's Sam Fisher himself! And boy, he looks none too happy. The obvious implication is that Ubisoft has some sort of Splinter Cell news cooking for the near future, perhaps to be revealed at the Summer Game Fest showcase, or a Ubisoft Forward event that hasn't yet been announced. But I have concerns that we are in fact being set up for yet more disappointment, and not just because Ubisoft has been pulling this shit for the better part of a decade now. (PC Gamer's Fraser Brown said he was convinced \"Ubisoft is just tormenting fans\" with elaborate trolling all the way back in 2020.) The real reason I expect this to end badly springs directly from the image Ubisoft shared today. Here's the alt-text: \"Close-up of Sam Fisher from Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, showing a stern expression with focused eyes, short dark hair, and a rugged beard, set against a blurred high-tech background. He's locked in.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. There's just one, well,wee tiny little problem:As sharp-eyed fanNaveen Chandarpointed out, \"Isn't that from the opening cinematic of Pandora Tomorrow, and not Chaos Theory?\" And you know what? It absolutely is. Here's Sam from the Pandora Tomorrow cinematic—it's cropped, and lower resolution, butit's the same picture. Look, mistakes happen, I get that. And honestly, at this point I kind of love the idea that this is all just an incredibly long-game troll—that somebody on Ubisoft's social media team hates Splinter Cell with a blazing-hot passion that's driven them to run a decade-long guerrilla harassment campaign against fans of the series purely out of spite. That would be funny! (Never forget that Julian Gerightyliterally did this,in 2019.) But more pragmatically, man, if Ubisoft doesn't even know which game their teaser images come from, I can't say it gives me great faith in its ability to put together a whole actual game within the span of years I have left on this Earth. This is Chaos Theory Sam, by the way: So that's where things stand: The summer showcase season is almost here, Ubisoft is teasing Splinter Cell again, it's not sure which game is which, and optimistically, maybe we'll see Sam Fisher in Fortnite before the year is out. Or,maybe, we'll get a whole new game—maybe this time it'll actually happen! Look, I might be jaded and cynical, but I'm also a sucker.

    "title": "Path of Exile 2 director says GGG is learning from its mistakes while supporting 2 games at once: 'If you want to lock the date, you can't lock the features'",
    "article_text": "Path of Exile is moving to a four-month update cycle. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. When Grinding Gear Games first announced Path of Exile 2, it made a promise: PoE1 wasn't going anywhere, and development on both titles would continue in parallel. Ten months after the last Path of Exile league, it's clear that the studiobit off a bit more than it can chew, but game director Jonathan Rogers was optimistic in anew interviewwith YouTuber Talkative Tri this week that things are close to being back on track. One of the main problems, as he sees it, was that GGG veered from a development philosophy it'd had for a long time. \"If you want to lock the features, you can't lock the date,\" he said. \"And if you want to lock the date, you can't lock the features. In the past, we were always locking dates, but then as we had PoE2 in development, we got to the point where we were locking features instead and I think honestly that wasn't the best.\" Path of Exile 2's most recent update was called Dawn of the Hunt, and it's clear that the focus was squarely on a new class, the Huntress. This painted GGG into a bit of a corner—you can't really have a hunt dawning without, you know, someone to do the hunting. They couldn't make announcements about it until they were sure that she was ready, let alone start talking about anything they had cooking with PoE1. As a result, the update felt rushed, and personally I think that was a big contributor to its cool reception. Moving forward, Rogers said, this uncertainty will be a thing of the past. \"We're doing four months, it's going to be consistent, it's always going to be the case. We don't wanna have this kind of uncertainty around this any more,\" he declared, to the resounding cheers of grinders everywhere. With the new 3.26 league comingJune 13for PoE1, this puts us squarely on the release cadence initially promised. A new league or major patch every two months sounds like a dream come true for aPoE sickolike myself, but after over 300 days of radio silence on PoE1's 3.26 update I think you'd forgive me for being just a touch skeptical. I'm thinking we might see that number stretch a little bit, particularly at first. Rogers was adamant, though: \"With the new development model, like the date is fixed and the content is not, that might mean that the class we're planning to add might not make it. Now I think it will, but if it had to not make it in order to make it so all the other classes we already have are good, then we will do that tradeoff and that is not the mindset we were in for 0.2.0.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. He added that their primary focus for PoE2's 0.3 update was making sure that existing classes felt good to play, and if that came at the expense of the new one, so be it. The willingness to make cuts in the name of deadlines tells me that GGG is serious about sticking to the schedule, which is something the community's been clamoring for since the usual release window for PoE1 came and went half a year ago. We'll have to see how things shake out with the schedule, but for now at least thecontentis heading in the right direction. There have been a number of patches to Path of Exile 2 even in this interstitial time between major updates, improving some of the loot issues and other problems that Dawn of the Hunt had.Patch 0.2.1should be dropping any second now, which has further loot improvements, a whole-ass Expedition revamp, and new chase uniques. It also fixes some major issues—I knew Hidden Grotto was a pain, but did you know that it was 37.5% of all maps on the atlas? And apparently the chaos flowers in Ritual were responsible forfifty percentof player deaths in the endgame? Yeesh. GGG is hosting a livestream with details for the new PoE1 league on June 5, where we'll learn more about the patch.

    "article_text": "Former employees began sharing reports of cuts at Playtonic last week. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Yooka-Layleedeveloper Playtonic Games has laid off an undisclosed number of employees, confirming reports of cuts shared by former employees on social media over the past week. \"We've all seen in recent years how the games industry has been changing, resulting in studio after studio finding themselves in situations where to continue to exist, they must make painful decisions—decisions that impact the lives of so many individual talented developers,\" Playtonic said in today'sstatement. \"Like others, we've felt the knock-on effects and after exploring every possible avenue, we've had to make the incredibly heartbreaking decision to say goodbye to some truly brilliant members of the Playtonic team. \"This isn't simply a difficult moment, it's a period of profound change in how games are created and financed.

    "title": "If you're playing Elden Ring Nightreign solo, every merchant carries a revive item, you can carry two at once, and there are more solo QoL changes coming next week",
    "article_text": "The first patch already made a world of difference. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Yesterday,FromSoftwareput out anunexpected day one patch for Elden Ring Nightreignthat already included balance changes for the roguelike soulslike. The patch notes were characteristically terse, but they've already overhauled the solo experience, and we can expect another patch next week with further adjustments. But if you're playing Nightreign solo right now, here's the tldr: Most (all?) merchants now carry aWending Graceitem that revives you to full health when you die at a night boss. This is only in singleplayer, you can carry two at a time, and you should buy one whenever you see it. The following improvements for solo expeditions will be added to the game:- The effect \"Automatic Revival Upon Defeat\", which allows revival once per night boss battle, will be added to solo expeditions.- The amount of runes gained will be increased.Thank you for your support.May 30, 2025 On Twitter, the officialElden Ring account revealedthe two big changes we can expect next week. First, we'll get one free revive for each of the climax night bosses, and we'll also accrue runes faster than in co-op. This addresses two of solo play's biggest pitfalls: Not having allies to revive you when you go down, making any mistake extremely punishing, along with not being able to clear camps and level up as quickly as a trio. But the first, 1.01 patch already quietly improved solo play relative to its frustrating pre-release state. Lacking real patch notes, I can't say for certain everything that was tweaked, but I'm absolutely doing much more damage now than in pre-launch singleplayer. Even bigger though is that aforementioned Wending Grace change. In co-op, it's an exceedingly rare drop that can only be acquired from certain high-level bosses. In pre-release solo play, the final merchant before the Nightlord was the only one guaranteed to carry a Wending Grace. Now it's a Wending Grace-a-palooza. If every merchant doesn't sell one in singleplayer, it's certainly most of them⁠—I've got confirmed sightings at the settlement and fort merchants so far. That helps make up for not having friends to revive you in solo play, and coupled with the upcoming free revive in patch 1.02, we'll be able to have up to three chances to get back up and keep fighting against Nightreign's toughest bosses. Nightreign is still best enjoyed in co-op, but now its singleplayer feels like less of a compromised, frustrating experience⁠—and it's still plenty challenging, don't worry, fellow Souls sickos. Perhaps the most surprising thing here is how quick FromSoftware was to roll out a patch addressing player critiques⁠—far from a given with the infamously withdrawn studio, which typically operates at an imperious remove from the hoi polloi.

    "article_text": "Two months after voting to authorize a strike, the finish line is in sight. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Just two months after voting toauthorize a strike actionover stalled negotiations with Microsoft, ZeniMax Workers United-CWA has announced a tentative contract agreement that includes \"substantial across-the-board wage increases\" along with new minimum salaries for employees, protections against arbitrary dismissal, grievance procedures, and a new policy for game credits \"that clearly acknowledges the QA workers' contributions to the videogames they help create.\" \"QA workers from across the country continue to lead the charge for industry-wide change,\" senior QA tester and ZeniMax Workers United-CWA bargaining committee member Page Branson said in theannouncement. \"Going toe-to-toe with one of the largest corporations in the world isn’t a small feat. This is a monumental victory for all current videogame workers and for those that come after.\" ZeniMax Workers United was formed in January 2023 and negotiations for a first contract began shortly thereafter, but made limited headway over the following two years. In April 2025, members voted to authorize union leadership to call for a strike if negotiations continued to drag on with no progress. \"If Microsoft and ZeniMax continue to demonstrate at the bargaining table that they're unwilling to pay us fair wages for the value our labor provides to our games, we'll be showing them just how valuable our labor is,\" ZeniMax Workers United-CWA Local 6215 member and senior QA tester Zachary Armstrong said at the time. Microsoft, however, said \"substantial progress\" had been made over the course of the negotiations, adding that it had presented a \"fair\" proposal to the union that \"if accepted it would result in immediate compensation increases, even more robust benefits and is in alignment to the company's hybrid model of three days in office.\" This isn't the end of the process: \"Contract explanation meetings\" for the union's more than 300 members will take place over the next few weeks, and a ratification vote is expected to be concluded by June 20. Assuming the union votes in favor (and I think that's a pretty safe assumption), this will be the first game industry contract of its kind in the US, but it surely won't be the last.

If you've been craving a choice-driven narrative experience with a supernatural kick, you might have your weekend plans set: Tell Me Why, an adventure game from the studio behind Life Is Strange, is free to keepon Steamright now. There didn't seem to be an explanation on Dontnod's socials, but it follows a pattern that's persisted thelast five years. When Pride Month rolls around, Tell Me Why goes free to keep. In apost on Xlast year, the studio asked that players spend what they might have on the game giving to a trans-inclusive charity. A couple you might consider are theTrevor ProjectorTransActual. As for the game, it's an episodic story about Tyler Ronan, a trans man, and his sister Alyson. They have a psychic bond which proves crucial in investigating their mother's death in \"small-town Alaska.\" It's the sort of thing you'll be familiar with if you playedLife is Strangeor the more recentLost Records: Bloom & Rage; as adventure games go, it's less about neuron-searing puzzles and more about watching your narrative choices ricochet off each other. Its apparent themes of self-discovery seem a prudent fit for Pride; telepathy aside, it's a rare game with a trans character front and center in a grounded, contemporary story. It enjoys a Very Positive user review rating on Steam, thoughour reviewwas a little cooler on it, scoring it a 69; writer Sam Greer said the game had \"craft and heart\" despite feeling \"at odds with itself.\" If you're keen to give the game a shot, all three episodes can be added to your library fromthe store page.

Elden RingNightreign is here, and as I write this there arenearly 300,000 playersroaming Limveld in pursuit of statistically-unlikely success in FromSoft's roguelike remix. The launch hasn't been without criticisms, many of which we shared in ourNightreign review, but that apparently hasn't slowed the influx of newly-christened Nightfarers. In a tweet from theofficial Elden Ring X account, Bandai Namco announced that two million people have played Elden Ring Nightreign in its first 24 hours. \"Darkness fell over Limveld, and two million Nightfarers rose up against it,\" Bandai Namco said. \"Thank you for your support.\" The spinoff title might have only reached a third of Elden Ring's day one player count, but that's still a huge number of players, equating to sales that many games published on Steam would be thrilled to attract in total across their entire lifespans. Not all those Nightfarers are thrilled with their early runs, however. Citing brutal singleplayer difficulty, struggles to coordinate in matchmade parties, and arbitrarily punishing difficulty tuning, early Steam reviewers have left the game at a \"Mixed\" rating, with only 64% leaving positive reviews. As a result, Nightreign has the unfortunate honor of being FromSoft'sworst-reviewed game launch on Steam. It's worth noting that this isn't the first time we've seen a less-than-stellar Steam reception for an Elden Ring release. When the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC launched in 2024,it quickly fell to a similar \"Mixed\" ratinga day after its release, with just 61% of reviews coming in positive as players slammed headfirst into its seemingly vertical difficulty curve. A year later, that DLC is generally held in high regard by Elden Ring sickos: Shadow of the Erdtree currently sits at an overall Steam review rating of \"Mostly Positive.\" Clearly, FromSoft's stumbles are capable of redemption arcs, but we'll have to see whethersingleplayer balance patchesand apotential duos modeearns Nightreign a lasting place in the community's good graces.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. CD Projektisn't quite finished withThe Witcher 3: Wild Huntjust yet. The studio announced today that it's got \"one more patch\" in the works for Geralt's big adventure that will add cross-platform mod support across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S through mod.io. \"Creating, sharing, and enjoying mods will be easier and more accessible, as players on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S will be able to share a modding ecosystem,\" CD Projekt said in theannouncement. There will be some limitations to mod support on consoles. Amod.ioaccount, connected to a CD Projekt Red account, will be required to access cross-platform mod support, and not every mod will be available on all platforms. \"Due to specific content guidelines and selection criteria for each platform, it may not be possible to bring every mod uploaded on PC to console,\" CD Projekt explained in an FAQ. \"Mods available on mod.io must also adhere to our Fan Content Guidelines and CD Projekt Red User Agreement.\" (So probably notVaginas for Everyone, I'm guessing.) Witcher 3 fans will also not be able to actually create mods on consoles—that will remain the exclusive purview of PC. Using CD Projekt's Redkit modding tools will not be mandatory for making cross-platform mods, but is recommended. This is a pretty big deal. Mods can extend a game's lifespan far beyond what it would normally be, and that'sas true for The Witcher 3 as it is for any game. (It also bears remembering that The Witcher 3 only got full-on mod support with therelease of Redkitlast year—prior to that, modders had to make do with the much more limitedModkit.)

The Witcher 3 hit50 million copies soldin May 2023, meaning it's moved another 10 million copies in two years, a number that would be enviable for just about any game, let alone one that's been around since 2015—and a pretty good reason to keep the support coming.

    "article_text": "Kill the goat-headed Libra, Creature of Night, to tick another Nightlord off your list. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. TheEquilibrious Beastexpedition is undoubtedly one of the coolest—but also seemingly most challenging—inElden Ring Nightreign, at least if you don't knowhow to beat Libra. Once you understand his mechanics, he's actually one of the easierNightreign bosseson your hitlist, if you can believe it. Like other Nightlords, your work starts right away as you enter the expedition, where you should visit thebest rune farming routesand hunt forlegendary weapons. However, as I'll go over later, this goat-headed beast actually offers various deals before the fight that you might want to accept. Here's how to best prepare for Libra throughout the Equilibrious Beast expedition: Despite this beast dealing madness damage, it's actually weak to it as well. In fact, dealing madness damage can temporarily make Libra enter a frenzy where it'll attack with a staff, rather than its terrifying AoE spells. Plus, Libra creates madness-repelling crystals that help keep both the madness buildup from its attacks or any of your spells under control. Unfortunately, madness gear is among the rarest to find in Limveld. Nevertheless, cross your fingers and use the map overlay to find locations that reward madness affinity gear, or you can visitmerchant locationssince they sell at least one item with the boss' weakness. Since madness weapons are rare, you'll likely need to rely on holy and fire damage, which Libra is also partially susceptible to. You won't be able to cause the unique frenzy interaction, but you'll still deal bonus damage. These weapons are much easier to find during expeditions, and you can also get relics that apply them to your starter weapon, which you can upgrade by findingsmithing stone locations. Thebest Wylder buildis also fantastic for dealing fire damage thanks to various unique relics that affect his abilities, while thebest Recluse buildmasters all kinds of magic and incantations. Libra deals hefty madness damage almost constantly from its wide array of spells. No matter how good you are at dodging, you're likely to take a hit at some point. As well as picking up the madness-reducing crystals Libra creates, you'll also want to pick up any madness-resistance gear you find on the expedition. Like most bosses, you'll want to be at least level ten before fighting Libra. With how oppressive this boss can be, I'd even suggest aiming for level 12 or more if you can, just to speed things up. Earn as many runes as you can and take out expedition bosses along the way for passive upgrades. You should also pick up as many flask charges as you can by visiting all the churches. Even more so than most Nightlords, your team composition is vital in beating Libra, at least in any kind of efficient manner. This is largely due to a move that allows it to buff its defences if you fail to interrupt it properly. It's pretty in line with the best characters in ourElden Ring Nightreign tier list, but here's who I recommend for Libra: Now that you've got an optimal team assembled, get to a Libra-ry because it's time to study its moveset. More so than most bosses, you won't be able to brute force the Equilibrious Beast; you effectivelyhaveto counter certain attacks to beat him. Unlike other Nightlords, Libra is also a one-phase fight, so he won't change his moveset. Before you get too happy, it's not really giving you less to remember, as the Equilibrious Beast has a stacked list of abilities that it'll quickly swap between. Libra is incredibly oppressive at all ranges. Throughout the fight, Libra also periodically creates crystals that reduce your madness buildup. Be sure to pick these up to avoid going mad, as you'll take damage and enrage the boss. I'm repeating this point for a good reason: in my experience, it's pretty much game over if Libra successfully completes its meditation, as the defensive boost lasts a significant amount of time and drastically reduces the damage you can deal. Whether you break the sigils or use an ultimate, stop this attack at all costs. When you enter Libra's arena, it'll actually be a rare peaceful encounter. Instead of outright attacking you, you can speak to it, where you'll be offered a series of random trades, but each one comes with a catch. These can range from surviving death once but reducing your max health, to gaining bonus levels but having each flask use reduce your level by one. Most of the time, I recommend refusing a deal altogether. While some can be great boosts, the drawbacks are large and not easily avoided. If you're a very skilled player and can avoid taking damage, then sure, getting bonus levels or tweaking your stats is a good choice, but otherwise it's a death sentence. While Libra's arsenal is almost entirely made up of large AoE attacks, the safest place to be is at close to medium range, where it's easier to kite around the boss. This is also where a mix of melee and ranged Nightfarers comes in handy, so you can have the likes of Wylder or Raider brawling while Ironeye or Recluse chip away slightly further back.

    "title": "This underwater city builder had me more emotionally invested in my corals than SimCity does in my human citizens, and you can try it at the next Steam Next Fest",
    "article_text": "Trade those traffic meters for filter feeders in Life Below. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I love metropolitan city builders, but once I'm done turning fertile riverside plains into a mess of eight-lane highways and coal plants, I can't help but wonder if I've maybe been a net negative for the world around me. When I sawLife Below on Steam—a city builder all about constructing reefs that opens its Steam description with \"the ocean is dying\"—I was flooded with the exact blend of guilt and intrigue I look for in my entertainment. After trying a demo build, I walked away pretty taken with its marine premise. The basics are similar to something like SimCity; you walk that line of territory expansion and resource management, mitigating random disasters while making sure your populous has a stable income of food, energy, and housing. Instead of electricity and traffic stops, though, you're working with fish, the algae they eat, the anemones that shelter them, and various resource-rich corals. The science isn't one-to-one with reality: resources are distributed by magic water spirits cultivated from stray souls, and you play as a tentacled ocean guardian called Thalassa. But it's just rooted in reality enough that when a heatwave hit my reef, I was scrambling to cool it down so my clownfish population weren't all rendered homeless. As you monitor pH levels, expand to new zones, and watch as new schools of fish dance around your base, it feels grounded enough to make sense of while retaining a sort of magical sensibility befitting the briny deep. In a press release Q&A, game director Lise Hagen Lie said it's all meant to foster a nurturing sensibility rather than an exploitative, imperial one: \"We want to show the spectacle of underwater life on nature's own basis, subverting the materialistic and human centred focus of traditional city builders … We had, for instance, workshops with marine biologists, who helped us make sure we had a certain amount of 'reality' in the game.\" The full game promises a narrative focus that, despite all the magic and spirits, is ultimately about the fragility of underwater ecosystems. Hagen Lie gave an example in the Q&A: \"The player might, for instance, experience lionfish infestations, where the here-invasive species infests a zone, causing devastating wildlife death. The fish living in that area will be eaten by the lionfish as it spreads, taking over neighboring areas until dealt with by the player. The loss of wildlife is devastating to the area, the coral structures and the reef itself—slowly killing the Reef Heart and the foothold the player has made.\" That might sound sort of intense, but the demo I played had a mostly languid pace and a pause button. It's hard to tell without a full gamut of zones how deep the city simulation goes, but the foundations are there for a robust, quirky take on the genre. If Life Below has piqued your interest, you won't have to wait long to give it a spin.

    "title": "SteelSeries Rival 3 Gen 2 Wireless review",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. This mouse is great if you want a reasonably priced Jack of all trades, thanks to its compatibility with removable, rechargeable batteries and its dual Bluetooth and 2.4 GHz connectivity. Unfortunately, however, it's a little too weighty and has a mushy, squeaky scroll wheel which, when combined with its mediocre sensor, makes it a less than ideal pick for gaming. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. I really wanted to love the SteelSeries Rival 3 Gen 2 Wireless, and in some ways, I do. It's very versatile, sturdy, and has reminded me of the veryreal benefits of removable batteries in gaming mice. It's also pretty well priced. Because of all this, I reckon it's ideal for some select use cases. However, I can't recommend it for use as a primary gaming mouse, not when there are cheaper options that do similar, such as the Logitech G305 Lightspeed, or better options for a little more cash, such as theTurtle Beach Burst II Airor even theLogitech G Pro X Superlight. But let's start off with the good. The SteelSeries Rival 3 Gen 2 Wireless shares many of the benefits of theoriginal Rival 3, and the main allure—apart from its striking 'Aqua' and 'Lavender' colour options that you can choose instead of plain black or white—is that it has dual wireless connectivity and removable batteries. This makes for an incredibly versatile mouse that's a great Jack of all trades. It has some other upgrades compared to the first edition—better battery life, PTFE feet, and click latency—but the main one is that it now supports rechargeable batteries. Buttons:6Connectivity:2.4 GHz, BluetoothSensor:TrueMove Air OpticalMax DPI:18,000Weight:106 g (2 x batteries), 95 g (1 x battery), 83.5 g (no batteries)Max acceleration:40 GMax speed:400 IPSPolling rate:Up to 1,000 HzBattery life:Up to 200 hours (2.4 GHz) / 450 hours (Bluetooth)RGB lighting:No (except on scroll wheel to highlight DPI/connection changes)Price:$60/£55 I've been a massive defender of wireless mice over the last few years, but I've always gone for the baked-in type. Now, after using the Rival 3 Gen 2 Wireless for a while, I must say I see the appeal. That's not only because you get some fantastic battery life out of removable batteries (up to 200 hours at 1,000 Hz polling with 2x AAA batteries, here), but also because you never have to plug your mouse in again if they're also rechargeable. The main benefit of removable, rechargeable batteries in your gaming peripherals is one we discovered with theSteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro headset: It allows you to keep one set of batteries charging while the other one's in use, then swap them over when the battery gets low. This means you can essentially have infinite battery life, without ever having to plug in your mouse. Of course, you'll have to have your batteries plugged in and charging somewhere, but that's more convenient. That kind of setup is possible with the SteelSeries Rival 3 Gen 2 Wireless, but only if you sort out your own rechargeable batteries and charging station. The mouse itself only comes with two single-use AAA batteries. Which means, of course, that if you want one of the main benefits of this mouse, you have to spend a bit extra. In practice, I found battery life to match up to what's claimed on the spec sheet. I used just one battery at a time to keep the mouse weight a little lighter at 95 g, and I found that to last me just over a week of daily use for work and gaming. Then I just popped off the top and swapped in the new AAA battery. The main downside to this setup is that 95 g weight. Stacked against some current competition, such as the aforementioned Turtle Beach Burst II Air orRazer DeathAdder V3 HyperSpeed, it's just far too heavy. It's par for the course for removable battery mice, sure—just ask the G305 Lightspeed—but it's a drawback nonetheless, unless you're one of the few to prefer a heavier rodent. It's not just the weight itself, either; it's the distribution. Because the batteries sit more towards the back of the mouse, there's a definite drag at the rear end. I found this very noticeable, and while I've become familiar with it over the last couple of weeks of use, I still notice it. It's not an uncomfortable mouse to use, mind. Far from it. The textured plastic surface feels very nice under my fingertips, and it feels incredibly comfy under my hybrid palm-claw grip. It's pretty shallow, though, so don't expect the pinnacle of hand support for all you palm grippers. It's sturdy, too, and certainly feels worth its $60 MSRP price tag on the build quality front. That is, in all but one area, this being the scroll wheel. Unfortunately, this mouse's wheel suffers (although not quite as badly) from what I distinctly remember my very first Razer DeathAdder mouse suffering many, many years ago: It's got a distinctive kind of mushiness to it that makes it feel a little…unsettledon its notches. As if it could slip into that no-go 'between the notches' zone at any moment. It's a difficult sensation to describe, but it suffices to say that it's not the best scroll wheel I've used. And I'm glad I didn't get around to writing this review until a few weeks in with the mouse, because until now, that was the only complaint I had about the mouse wheel, but as of today, it's started occasionallysqueaking, too. It doesn't happen all the time, but it's a particularly grating sound to my ears, and it's not a good sign that this has started after just a couple of weeks of use. The other thing that bugs me about the Rival 3 Gen 2 Wireless is its bottom switch that allows you to toggle between Bluetooth, 2.4 GHz, and Off. It's pretty difficult to switch between 2.4 and Bluetooth, and God help you if you want to switch it to the middle Off position. To get enough pressure on the tucked-in little bugger to get it to actually move, that's then so much pressure that it overshoots the middle. It's a good job the sleep functionality works a charm for that reason, because otherwise this thing's battery would drain a whole lot quicker. This can be toggled in the app settings, and I don't have any complaints on this front, really. You get plenty to fiddle with: polling, DPI, wireless stability enhancement (at the cost of battery life), and so on. When it comes to gaming, I had no issues with the mouse other than occasionally being a little bothered by its rear weighting. I'm used to lightweight mice like theLogitech G Pro X Superlight, though, and not everyone might find that as big of a deal. If maximising competitive performance is what you're going for, though, you're probably better off looking elsewhere. This mouse is still using the same TrueMove Air 18K sensor that the original used, and while 18,000 DPI and 400 IPS should be plenty for most people, it's often more about what those low numbers say about the sensor quality in general than the actual numbers they reach. Tested at 1,000 Hz and 800 DPI — The closer the dots are together, the more consistent a mouse is reporting movement. More variation or stray dots makes for a less accurate sensor. Tested at 1,000 Hz and 800 DPI — The spikes represent an increase in velocity, with more erratic spikes showing tracking going haywire. Tested at 1,000 Hz and 800 DPI — Each dot represents an update, which corresponds to the polling rate. Every 1 ms should mark a single update on a 1,000 Hz mouse. In the case of the SteelSeries Rival 3 Gen 2, my testing showed the sensor to be a little below average compared to some other gaming mice on the market right now. This primarily shows in the MouseTester sensor consistency results—there's a higher amount of tracking deviation than what you might want out of a sensor for, say, high-level gaming in pro shooters. ✅You want dual 2.4 and Bluetooth connection:This is a pretty well-priced gaming mouse to have such a feature. It's great if you switch between devices a lot. ❌ You want the best gaming performance:The Rival 3 Gen 2's sensor isn't as good as what you can get in some other gaming mice today, and the mouse weighs more than many, too. I didn't run into any problems clicking heads inCounter-Strike 2or tracking enemy Pharahs with Soldier's rifle inOverwatch 2(well, no more problems than usual, anyway), but better-performing hands and eyes than mine might be able to notice the difference between this and a top-tier sensor. So, with all this being said and done, why would one pick up a Rival 3 Gen 2 Wireless? Well, as I said at the start, I think this mouse is great as a Jack of all trades kind of deal—perhaps if you want to use it not primarily for gaming but for work and travel, too. Its ability to run off rechargeable, removable batteries makes it attractive on the battery life front, and its dual 2.4 GHz and Bluetooth modes make it very versatile. Apart from the slight fiddliness of actually flicking the switch, swapping between the two connections is a breeze, and it allows me to go back and forth between using it with my gaming PC and my laptop at will, instantly. If all of that is specifically your jam, then have at it. Just remember that you have to spend extra for rechargeable batteries and a battery charger if you want one of this mouse's main benefits. For me, the weightiness, the mediocre sensor, and most importantly, the squeaky and slightly mushy scroll wheel make it a no-go, considering there are other great options on the market for a similar price. It's a shame, because it'd have been nice to keep on the rechargeable, reusable battery bandwagon more permanently, but the drawbacks aren't worth it here. This mouse is great if you want a reasonably priced Jack of all trades, thanks to its compatibility with removable, rechargeable batteries and its dual Bluetooth and 2.4 GHz connectivity. Unfortunately, however, it's a little too weighty and has a mushy, squeaky scroll wheel which, when combined with its mediocre sensor, makes it a less than ideal pick for gaming.

    "title": "The Kingmakers system requirements show that the hardest part of running the game may be finding 80 GB free for the install",
    "article_text": "A surprise, and a pleasant one at that. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Kingmakers system requirements have just been revealed, and it is looking incredibly easy to run. Given how ambitious the game is, and the fact that it's built in Unreal Engine 5 despite those specs, I can only hope it runs as easily as it is to play. As spotted byPCGamesN, you have to go somewhere no person should ever set foot in to find the Kingmakers system requirements: theEpic Games Store. Notably, theSteam page for the gamedoesn't have system requirements yet. To run Kingmakers on Minimum settings, you need a 10th Gen Intel Core i5 processor or better. This could be a chip like theIntel Core i5 10600K, a relatively modest chip from 2020 we rather liked. Alongside this, you will need at least anRTX 2060. These two specs aren't too tough at all, given a budget to mid-range rig from 2020 can run Kingmakers. The biggest problem many rigs from that era will have is finding the 80 GB of storage to actually download the game. Whereas the 8 GB memory requirement feels almost unheard of for a game of its size launching later this year. Minimum Recommended OS Windows 10 x 64 Windows 10 x 64 CPU 10th gen Intel i5 10th gen Intel i7 GPU RTX 2060 RTX 3070 Memory 8 GB 16 GB Storage 80 GB 80 GB Even running the game on Recommended settings isn't too bad. You will need a 10th Gen Intel Core i7 processor, or better, and anRTX 3070to run the game. The RAM requirement jumps to a still pretty decent 16 GB, and, as is to be assumed, the storage requirements stay the same. There are a few things worth noting about the way these system requirements are set up. For one, they're only available in the Epic Games Store, and before release, so they are subject to change. No commitment to system requirements on Steam is certainly a strange choice. It also lacks AMD in both the CPU and GPU categories (sorry team red), but I'm hoping we get clearer spec requirements closer to its release. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Kingmakers feels like a game conjured up by 12-year-old me. You play a soldier in the middle of a medieval battle, except you now have a gun, and there's also a time-bending element, explaining where you got all that gear from. It's part action game, part RTS, and built in Unreal Engine 5. This is a bit of a strange choice, as strategy games need to produce a high density of bodies, and UE5 shines in those close-up environments.Early trailerscertainly look a tad grainy, but that could be down to any number of post effects or even (shudders) motion blur. The game launches into early access on October 8, so we're hoping for a little more information on how the game runs, what it's about, and if we need to do any more upgrades to get it running. As the requirements look right now, there's a good chance you don't. I may just have to delete one or two things.

    "title": "FromSoftware's clunky UI and coy descriptions are keeping me from truly loving Elden Ring Nightreign",
    "article_text": "Let me love you the way I want to. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Elden Ring Nightreignis quickly proving itself to be a bitmarmitein reception—at least, on first blush. It's my opinion that the game'll likely pick up in opinion as the playerbase, like me, gets used to this bizarre, experimental, and harsh co-op game's eccentricities. Now that I'm well and truly submerged in the Nightreign soup, I'm having a grand old time. I'm familiar with theExecutor's ins and outs, what thebest relics and relic ritesare for it, and so on—but there's just one problem.FromSoftware's infamously obtuse UI design and coy descriptions, part of the charming and occult vibe ofits previous games, are a massive obstacle to enjoying Nightreign. Before I have a big gripe, though, I want to talk about why FromSoftware's tendency to hide knowledge behind a layer of mist works in its other titles. An archetypal souls game is, in part, characterised by mystery and discovery. For example: What lies in the serpent-filled Sen's Fortress is an intimidatingmysteryyou want to solve—and you quicklydiscoverthat swinging axe traps are very good at cutting you in half. Games like Dark Souls andElden Ringare intimidating mountains to climb, with hidden pitfalls and secret mechanics, but they're ones you can tackle at more-or-less your own pace. There's a deep satisfaction to be found in inching around corners, building out a mental map of your surroundings so that you can deepen your understanding of them. Learning boss movesets off by heart. This sense of mystery and discovery is preserved in item descriptions and UI elements. How a weapon passive improves your ability to survive in a harsh and unyielding world isn't always clear—and you get to feel a sense of mastery over not just the environment, but your own arsenal as you come to understand how weapons affect your stats. The act of humbly muddling through item descriptions has the same feel as casting Identify in a TTRPG. It's clunky, but it works to sell you on a feeling of oldschool RPG grit. A community is built up around this mystery, too. Builds are formulated, theories are crafted, and everyone generally has a good time. When the build maestros stumble upon something busted and broken, it's an event—folks get to venture back into the world armed not just with skill, but with knowledge and ambition. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Nightreign does have this to a certain extent. I like knowing a shortlist of clutch item interactions. I enjoyed discovering that the \"X while walking\" passives worked hand-in-hand with the Executor's Cursed Sword stance, and I feel more powerful now that I understand the most lucrative parts of each biome and building. But I wish the game would just say what it means from time to time. While I also play a lot of souls games, I happen to enjoy a roguelike on occasion. The reason I like roguelikes is because I get to feel clever when I stumble across an unexpected build path that turns me into a living god—a build I pieced together on the fly from the scraps I've been given by the game. A roguelike, however, needs to clearly and cleanly communicate what a given item or passive you're picking up is going to do. And itespeciallyneeds to do this if you're on a time limit. The problem with Nightreign's attitude towards this is twofold. First up, when you look at a weapon, you're only given a brief description of its passive traits—if you want to learn more, you need to go through the laborious process of opening up your inventory screen, clicking in your stick, and flicking through the passives. This becomes even worse when you realise that you can't inspect items unless they're already in your bags, turning decisions that could be quick, simple deliberations into laborious inventory jenga—jenga you don't have time for, given the rains are closing in, and every second you spend not farming runes or clearing out camps is a second you're falling behind. The core experience of kill, loot, repeat might be improved just a smidge by telling you what something does without awkward fumbling.\" Then there's the descriptions themselves. While most passives are self-explanatory percentage boosts, some pretentious sod at FromSoftware decided \"Power of the Dark Moon\" was an apt descriptor for just about anything. \"The Executor's Grief\"? I'm feeling pretty aggrieved over these UI decisions! Imagine me slapping my knee and having a sensible chuckle. And, yes, you can get more detailed explanations by picking the item up, opening your equipment screen, yada yada. But, also, have we considered that they could just not make you do that? That the core experience of kill, loot, repeat might be improved just a smidge by telling you what something does without awkward fumbling? This even extends to relics. \"Improved madness resistance\" is a prime example. Typically, talismans give you a percentage damage resistance, but not here, and I couldn't tell you why not. \"Taking attacks improves attack power.\" What's considered 'taking' an attack? Hell if I know. \"Ultimate Art Gauge +1\"—am I getting a new Ultimate Art Gauge charge, is my gauge charging faster, and what does the +1 mean? What's the difference between a +1 and +2 of this relic? The meaning is lost to time. And sure, you can equip these relics and do a run to find out, but I don't know if that lends itself to a feeling of eerie mystery. It's more like opening Wikipedia and being given directions to your local library instead of, you know, a description of the thing you're looking up. Except your local library is filled with monsters who want to stab you very much. All of these design decisions—which work just fine in a game where you have all the time in the world to experiment and theorycraft—immediately crumple upon impact like a car made out of tinfoil when they hit Nightreign's time pressure. A time pressure I don't have any issue with in isolation, to be clear. I'm one of the sickos who enjoys having to speedrun a boss, feeling the light breeze from the swaying of Damocles' sword overhead as I wonder when the next tightening of the rope will occur. The oppressive drone of the encroaching storm, the purple flames licking at your heels, it all works great when you aren't playing freaking ARPG build Tetris with your goddamn swords because of some obstinate UI design that hasn't been upgraded in however-many games. My reward for efficiently cleaning up a camp, every time, is a session of literal item juggling and squinting at my screen. It's a huge issue, a thorn in the side of the game's dopamine loop. I want to git gud at fighting, not navigating menus—and FromSoftware has really made almost no effort to improve how it imparts all of this info to me. I hope future patches consider increasing the readability of the UI—otherwise, this one unfortunate snag is going to stop me from well and truly loving Elden Ring Nightreign, and it just didn't have to be this way. FromSoftware: I beg of thee, give me just a little bit more knowledge. I promise I'll use it well.

    "title": "Update: The Elden Ring Nightreign Duos mod from the creator of Seamless Co-op is already available to download and play",
    "article_text": "\"There's also potential for a player cap increase in the future.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. 5/30/25:Well that didn't take long at all. We reported this morning that modder Yui of Seamless Co-op fame already had a Nightreign prototype in the works, one that would most notably allow for two-player co-op in addition to triples and solo. Now it's alreadyup and available for download on the Elden Ring Nightreign Nexus. We'll be checking it out ourselves to see how Yui's effort improves on FromSoft's co-op-focused roguelike. Original Story:FromSoftware, I love thee dearly—but I think we can all agree that your multiplayer elements are always a little goofy. In the Dark Souls games andElden Ring, the laborious process of summoning phantoms to your world is kinda part of the charm: a diegetic way to invite spirits beyond the rift into your RPG. Elden Ring Nightreign, on the other hand, has straight-up matchmaking. And even then, FromSoftware found a way to make it more complex than it needs to be, withtwo-player games completely overlookedbecause of reasons, I guess. While good ol' FromSoft is busy \"considering [it] for post-launch support\" or whatever, the genius behindElden Ring's game changing seamless co-op mod, LukeYui, simply waltzed on in, took one look at Nightreign, and said: Yep, I can fix 'er up. On ablog postto their Patreon, LukeYui writes: \"Elden Ring: Nightreign was released today. I played a little bit this evening and managed to get together a functional multiplayer system without connecting to the matchmaking servers (and therefore not needing to run EAC).\" I want to take a moment and note that this blog post was, at the time of writing, made 12 hours ago. Nightreign was released approximately 16 hours ago on PC as of me penning this article. That means it took LukeYui all offour hoursto get a working prototype for a seamless, EAC-free multiplayer mod up and running. \"The benefit to this of course is you can opt to play with just 2 players (instead of matchmaking with a random) and also being able to play mods when they are eventually made for more replayability and customisation,\" then, to put a cherry on top, LukeYui hints at a banger upgrade that I'd love to play someday: \"There's also potential for a player cap increase in the future.\" The elephant in the room is that, while FromSoftware isn't actively opposed to stuff likethe seamless co-op modin Elden Ring, its tune might change a tad for Nightreign. It's not a competitive multiplayer game, mind, but I can imagine the studio will want to keep its online elements free of hackers who might spoil the intended sense of progression for others. There's a reason why the game has an anti-cheat. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. LukeYui isn't \"committed to making this a public mod as of yet, however if people would like it just let me know and I'd get a release ready. If not, then I'll just keep it as a WIP project on the side.\" I, for one, would love to attend a Limgrave rave with 50Guardians dive-bombing the everloving crud out of Margit. It's what he deserves.

    "title": "Civilization 7's senior historian once deleted Civ 6's massive Civilopedia, replacing every entry with a single warmongering emperor: 'The entire folder just went, and I looked, and it was just my one little entry'",
    "article_text": "How Emperor Basil II conquered all of history. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Byzantine emperor Basil II had an illustrious career. He ruled for almost 50 years, stood fast during a time of perpetual civil war, subjugated the First Bulgarian Empire and won a large number of military campaigns. And thanks to Dr. Andrew Alan Johnson, he briefly conquered history, replacing every single entry inCivilization 6's meaty Civilopedia. Johnson is an associate professor at Stockholm University and a historical consultant. He's worked with Firaxis since Civilization 6—specifically the New Frontier Pass, which introduced Byzantium, along with Basil II. Johnson is a cultural anthropologist working at Stockholm University as an associate professor in the department of social anthropology where he focuses on Southeast Asia. He also serves as an anthropological and historical consultant for popular media, particularly games. You can find out more about his work on hiswebsite. \"So I come to Firaxis, and they tell me, 'OK, so first couple of days, just play the game; get really familiar with the game.' And that wasn't hard, because I was a fan long before I was an employee there,\" Johnson tells me. \"And then let's write some entries.\" Johnson has been responsible for everything from achievement names to helping the art team get the outfits for historical leaders just right, but he also wrote a lot of entries for Civ's mammoth compendium of knowledge—the aforementioned Civilopedia. \"I think they were entries for people like Bà Triệu, for Basil, the New Frontiers Pass civilisations, leaders and wonders,\" he recalls. \"And then here we upload it onto the database. And I just uploaded it over every other file. The entire folder just went, and I looked, and it was just my one little entry on Basil II. That's it. That's the Civilopedia. Archer? Basil. Egypt? Basil.\" After turning the Civilopedia into a monument to Basil II's achievements, he thought his time at Firaxis had come to an end. \"It was a good week that I had in game dev. I'm going to go and, I don't know, maybe be a nomad or something like that, raise sheep in Montana.\" Luckily, being a shepherd was not on the cards. \"There are measures that a company like Firaxis has to prevent this, so going to IT, saying my mea culpa, they were able to rescue it [by] rolling it back to the previous version. But that was my first real experience getting into game design.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. While it might have felt like a harrowing trial by fire at the time, the experience emphasises how different it is to work on a team project when compared to Johnson's other life, in academia, where everything falls on his own shoulders. \"Especially in my field, in anthropology, I am the data collection tool,\" he says. \"I'm the person who writes the thing. And when I send something out, it is all me that is in there. And so if I screw something up conceptually, or if I lose my field notes—there's stories of anthropologists who have lost all their field notes in some disaster, and a friend of mine had all his field notes taken by the police—if you lose something like that, that's on you. You have to rewrite the entire thing.\" Clearly Firaxis was prepared for these kinds of mistakes, and the studio continued to work with Johnson, who also wrote theCivilization 7Civilopedia among other things. Chatting to him, it's just really fascinating to hear how he approached it, echoing what he told us earlier in the year, where he said he wantedCiv 7 to be a \"gateway drug\" into history. The Civilopedia is a platform where Johnson can educate, can share his passion for history and anthropology, and use his expertise to enlighten gamers. \"I don't need to explain what archery is, so this gives me the opportunity to take a page, or take a few paragraphs and tell the story and talk about how, actually, archery radically predates anything in Civ. \"You can make bows out of horn. You can make bows out of wood. You've gotta think about tensile strength. You've gotta think about power versus mobility. So a longbow is good because of the grain of the wood and a particular kind of a tree. You can get better power in a smaller space if you mix materials and glue things together with bone and wood and then use that on top of a horse. But if you go to a warm, wet climate, as the Mongols found out, all those bows are going to break.\" So Johnson was able to tell you all about technology that \"you think you know already\" and then reveal how \"accidents, unexpected consequences or unseen factors, like material, play into the way history plays out\". While I went into our conversation looking to hear more about how Johnson deleted the Civilopedia, we ended up having a wide-ranging chat about AI, history, academia and how it intersects with game development, so keep an eye out for more articles from this interview over the next few days.

    "article_text": "No one can get enough of looting valuables and running from monsters. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In arecent video published by semiworkaboutREPO's first update, developers shared a little insight into how they've responded to the sudden success of their co-op horror game. As it turns out, its popularity took the team by complete surprise and in a way was the saving grace semiwork needed to continue as a game studio. In previous videos shared to both social media and YouTube, semiwork have already expressed their gratitude toward everyone taking the time to play REPO, alongside sharing how overwhelming the sudden success has been. However, in the most recent video, developers say the game \"literally made semiwork as a studio survive. One day we were crossing our fingers for rent money, and the next we had millions of players storming our servers to play our game.\" Even though semiwork are proud of REPO's popularity, they reiterate that it hasn't exactly been smooth sailing and a lot of work has come alongside the rapid increase of players. \"This sudden and explosive success for our little indie game studio came with massive mountains of paperwork, preventing hackers from destroying the game too much, bug squashing, and all of this pulled our tiny team away from all the fun stuff,\" semiwork continued. \"Which is to create actual content for the game.\" Fortunately, it seems as if semiwork are finally pulling themselves out of this neverending to-do list now and the entire team can start dedicating more time to the content of the game rather than the grind behind the scenes. With the upcoming update already drumming up plenty of excitement, and a handful of videos showing off a plethora of new content for us to sink our teeth into, I can only imagine REPO's popularity continuing. To reassure players who have patiently been waiting for this update since it was first announced on March 7, semiwork concluded, \"We are finally punching through that long to-do list, so future updates won't take this long. We cannot wait to truly create content for REPO. As promised, there will be new monsters, new valuables, new items, and other surprises along this journey. So stay tuned for that.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Kara is an evergreen writer.

Users with both ASRock motherboards and AMD 9000-series chips found that something in that specific combination was causing CPUs to die. In an interview withGamers Nexus, Chris Lee, the VP of motherboards at ASRock, explained the three central cases they found when analysing the problem. The first, which is said to be a \"small percentage\", was simply down to user error. Debris finding its way into the socket or getting thermal paste in the wrong place are just some of the cases where user damage can be attributed to. In \"a lot of cases\", after sending CPUs to AMD, it was found out that the CPUs were actually still operational. The cause for this problem is reportedly a mixture of memory compatibility issues and a BIOS problem. BIOS update 3.25 launched just a few weeks ago (and can be accessed via theASRock site), and Lee claims this fixes a problem where the Thermal Design Current (TDC) and Electric Design Current (EDC) were set too high for some AMD chips. The memory compatibility issue was reportedly fixed with the previous BIOS update, 3.20. This was explained a few days ago as a PBO (Precision Booster Overdrive) issue, as the two currents are linked to that mode, but it wasn't made clear which company was actually responsible. In the latest video, ASRock notably states it is not AMD's fault. However, this does not account for users who don't have PBO active running into those problems, or claims thatsome userswith the recommended BIOS update are still running into the same problem. As it's all still developing, those cases could be outliers, but users will need time with the new BIOS to see what issues it fixes. Notably, this update will be present on motherboards manufactured in the future, but not those that are already at retail. If you have an ASRock motherboard, make sure you're on the latest version of the BIOS. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Lee tells Gamers Nexus that if there's a problem with the CPU, ASRock will send it back to the user to go through the RMA process with their retailer. ASRock can't replace failing chips, but it could function as a middleman to retailers, which it is currently refusing to do. Notably, though, Lee says this is the case with defective CPUs, so there's a chance he could have misunderstood Gamers Nexus' question as one pertaining to already failing CPUs. In the interview, Lee claims that ASRock did manage to get its hands on a CPU with scorch marks (indicating faults due to voltage shortage), and it has been sent off to AMD, but analysis has not yet come back. Despite months of back and forth, it seems this story isn't quite complete, but either way, now is a good time to get that BIOS update, if you have aRyzenX3D chip in an ASRock motherboard.

    "title": "A graphical history of id Tech: Three decades of cutting-edge graphics and game engine technologies",
    "article_text": "It's not just about Doom. Okay, it's mostly about Doom. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Over 30 years ago, way back in 1992, developers id Software launched Wolfenstein 3D on PCs. Unbeknownst at the time, it also kick-started an evolutionary tree for a series of game engines that are not just synonymous with id Software's subsequent Doom and Quake franchises, but are also famous for pushing the boundaries of graphics rendering. Yes, we're talking about id Tech, and with Doom: The Dark Ages, we've now reached version eight. Of course, game engines are more than just about graphics, but it's arguably what made id Tech as famous as it is. So let's take a journey through each successive version of the evergreen game engine, looking at the first game to use it, what made it stand out from the crowd, and take a quick browse through the work of other developers that licensed id Tech for their own projects. In 1992, id Software's programming duties were handled by just three people: John Carmack (graphics and runtime code), John Romero (tools used to make the game), and Jason Blochowiak (sub-routines). Together, they created what would eventually be called id Tech 0, though at the time, it was simply labelled 'Wolfenstein 3D engine'. It wasn't the first game that Carmack coded to use 3D graphics, though he chose an unusual method for rendering the three-dimensional world: ray casting. In some ways, ray casting is similar to the ray tracing we see in the very latest games, but due to the limitations of gaming PCs in the 1990s, Carmack was forced to keep it very simple. In Wolfenstein 3D, the graphics rendering starts with the engine creating the ceiling and floor via a flood fill, as two blocks of colour. Then one ray is cast or 'marched' out for every vertical line of pixels—for a resolution of 1080p, that would be a total of 1920 rays. Of course, in 1992, we're only talking about 320 or so rays! Each ray traverses a two-dimensional map of the world and travels until it reaches an object, such as a wall or door. From how far the ray has travelled, the object's size is calculated and appropriately scaled, to give the impression of depth. A spot of clever math is also used to correct the perspective of the objects, otherwise, everything would look warped, fisheye lens style. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Once this is all done, the engine then colours and textures the column of pixels, before moving on to the next ray. After all of this has been achieved, objects such as enemies, ammo, and food are rendered in the form of 2D sprites. We've skipped over a lot of the technical details, but if you're interested in understanding exactly how it all works, then grab a copy ofWolfenstein 3D Game Engine Black Bookby Fabien Sanglard. id Tech 0 would be licensed by a handful of other developers, with the most notable being Apogee Software, which created theRise of the Triad, a game that we reckon everyone should play at least once. For id Software's 1993 follow-up, the seminal Doom, Carmack created an improved rendering algorithm he developed for the SNES version of Wolfenstein 3D. Instead of using ray casting to calculate what should be displayed, Doom's engine (aka id Tech 1) handles all of this through a BSP tree or binary space partitioning tree. Just like its predecessor, Doom's levels are all 2D maps, and a BSP algorithm is used to split them up into a data structure that makes it super quick to work out if something is visible or not. Vertical surfaces are rendered first, such as walls and doors, by working through the BSP tree. This is followed by all the horizontal surfaces—ceilings and floors—that don't get rendered during the 'vertical' phase. 2D sprites are handled next, to fill the world with monsters, weapons, and ammo, before the final effect—the game's head-up display. Just as for Wolfenstein 3D, Fabien Sanglard has written a superb breakdown of the making of Doom and how its engine fundamentally works. If you want to know exactly how BSPs are used in the game, then theDoom Game Engine Black Bookis a must-read. Doom's impact on the world of gaming is hard to overstate—not just in terms of shaping genres and game design, but also in how its engine would be licensed by other developers to create very successful games. Wolfenstein 3D and Doom's engines would only be used in a handful of other games, though the latter would be used to create the fantastic Heretic and its sequel, Hexen. But things really changed for id Software's next big release. Given Doom's rampant success, it was always going to be a challenge to come up with something better. Fortunately, 1996'sQuakewould turn out to be just as influential as its predecessor. This was in no small part due to the new game engine that Carmack and co created, as id Tech 2 sported an entirely new renderer. Instead of flat maps drawn to mimic three dimensions, then overlaid with 2D pre-rendered sprites, Quake's engine handled everything in true 3D. Just like most games do today, arrays of vertices were used to generate polygonal meshes, where the engine transforms and lights them, before rasterising them into pixels. Textures are then applied to each polygon in one rendering pass, with pre-rendered lightmaps blended in a second pass. The result was a world that you could look at and move in any direction, with surfaces no longer constrained to be full vertical or horizontal. Those pre-rendered lightmaps did a great job of giving a sense of realistic lighting and shadowing—for 1996, of course! 1997'sQuake 2's engine was more of the same (i.e. still essentially id Tech 2), just with sensible improvements all around, such as using the OpenGL API for rendering, allowing for better graphics and performance on graphics cards that supported it. But perhaps what made the engine really stand out is the number of other developers who licensed either and used it to create some outstanding games.Hexen 2and Heretic 2, Malice,SiN, Kingpin, Soldier of Fortune, andAnachronoxwere all great games in their own right, though the real star has to beHalf-Life. Admittedly, Valve rewrote an awful lot of id Tech 2 for its masterpiece, as well as created its own tools and additional sub-routines, but if it didn't exist in the first place, would Half-Life have been as good as it was? With Doom sidelined in favour of Quake, id Software chose a multiplayer focus for 1999's Quake 3 Arena, but that didn't mean Carmack gave up pushing the graphics envelope to new heights. Quake 3 Arena's engine (they still weren't being labelled as id Tech at this stage) introduced three big improvements for graphics: spline-based curved surfaces, shaders, and a fast inverse square root function. The first one solved the problem that 3D polygonal games suffered from at the time: how to make a surface look curved instead of angular. This was done by using Bézier patches to tessellate, or split up, a mesh into dozens more smaller triangles, which together give the impression of a curved surface. Today's graphics cards can handle billions of triangles, but back then, it was a major breakthrough in producing ever-more realistic graphics at a playable frame rate. That said, Quake 3 Arena could still bring the most powerful of gaming rigs to its knees once the resolution and graphics settings were maxed out. The shader system used in Quake 3 Arena was very much a precursor to the shaders used in today's games. Rather than just applying a base texture and lightmap to a polygon, the engine used small scripts to describe the properties of a surface. In this file, there would be information about textures, blending, volumes, emissivity, and even what audio files should be played if the player interacts with the surface. And while he didn't invent the technique itself, Carmack's implementation of calculating the inverse square root of a number—that is, one divided by the square root of something—became famous in programming circles for being a masterpiece in optimisation and speed. But what truly made id Tech 3 stand out was the sheer number of games created with it, and the list reads like a 'Who's Who?' of gaming. The two Star Trek: Elite Force shooters, two Medal of Honor games, the original Call of Duty, the Star Wars Jedi Knight duo, Soldier of Fortune's sequel, Return to Castle Wolfenstein, andAmerican McGee's Alice,to name but a few!For its next big release, though, id Software decided it was time to return to an old classic. Doom 3appeared in 2004, and once again, id Software used a new engine, id Tech 4, to raise the graphics bar to a new level. Texturing was now far more advanced, supporting the use of normal and specular maps to improve the level of fine detail on surfaces. To make this even better, though, Doom 3's renderer calculated all of the lighting on a per-pixel basis, rather than just colouring a triangle's corner (a vertex) and then interpolating that across the rest of the polygon. Doom 3 also used stencil buffers for its shadow volumes, and together with the per-pixel lighting, the game's visuals were second to none. However, the game's performance wasn't so great. The original Doom was all about frantic, fast-paced action, whereas Doom 3 was considerably slower—almost like an action, survival-horror game. But even so, the use of stencil buffers and the lighting algorithm demanded the very latest GPU features, leaving a lot of older hardware unable to run the game, and even with a high-end graphics card, the performance was never great. id Tech 4 was less popular with other developers, too, and compared to Quake 3 Arena, only a small number of studios used it for their games. Still, it gave us the much-malignedQuake 4, the original Prey, Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, and the underratedBrink. Five years after the launch of Doom 3, id Software was acquired by ZeniMax Media, which also owned Bethesda Softworks, and from that point onwards, id Software's engines would only be used by itself and ZeniMax's other studios. Doom 3's engine would also be the last one that id Software ever released the source code for. In 2011, id Software once again introduced a new engine with a new name, and even a new game IP.Ragewas powered by id Tech 5 (the older engines were then retrospectively renamed in the same manner), and its main standout rendering feature was a technology called MegaTexture. Technically known asvirtual texturing(pdf warning), the method involves using incredibly large textures, up to 128,000 pixels square, where sections would be sampled to be applied to a polygon mesh. The idea behind this is that the main, massive texture would stay in system memory and only the parts required would be streamed into the GPU's local memory. The benefit of this is that id Software could make one renderer that would work exactly the same, regardless of the hardware platform. Unfortunately, the reality was a whole heap of bugs and rendering glitches at launch, though when everything did work well, the texture quality was certainly better than many other PC games at that time. It helped that id Tech 5 was packing a whole raft of other graphics tricks, such as soft shadows, HDR rendering, volumetric lighting, screen space reflections, depth of field, and motion blur. ZeniMax Media had two of its developers use id Tech 5. MachineGames created the Wolfenstein reboots ofThe New OrderandThe Old Blood, and Tango Gameworks madeThe Evil Withinseries, albeit heavily rewriting id Tech 5 for the second title. In 2013, John Carmack left id Software for new ventures, the last of the original team to leave, joining Oculus VR to help develop its virtual reality hardware and software. It was a bold move to reboot such a well-known franchise, but that's exactly what id Software did, and in 2016,Doomreturned and with one hell of an engine. While he was still at id Software, John Carmack explored the use of ray tracing and voxels for the next id Tech iteration, but when he left, the developers stuck to a traditional polygonal mesh renderer with standard rasterisation to create id Tech 6. MegaTextures were still in full use but higher in quality, and along with the entire dictionary of modern rendering techniques, the new Doom not only looked extremely good, but it ran very well, too. It also had a couple of new tricks up its sleeve, such as temporal anti-aliasing, or TAA. This had already been around for a while, but id Tech 6 added the use of super-sampling of motion data to remove the shimmering and blurring that TAA is well-known for. While it might sound like id Tech 6 didn't bring anything significant to the world of rendering,Adrian Courrèges' breakdownof the graphics in Doom (2016) shows just how complex and multifaceted everything is behind the scenes.Sadly, id Tech 6 would only be used two more times, by MachineGames again, for two more Wolfenstein games —The New ColossusandYoungblood. The latter was later patched to support Nvidia'sRTX technology, though, as it was an early implementation of ray tracing, the results didn't justify the performance hit. For 2020's Doom Eternal, id Software took id Tech 6 and gave it a thorough overhaul, removing the OpenGL code in favour of Vulkan-only, as well as dropping MegaTextures. By now, id Tech was running as a heavily multi-threaded engine, and instead of using a primary thread to handle the rendering, multiple threads were tasked to operate in parallel, handling shaders, asset streaming (geometry and textures), and data decompression. The end result is a game that has vastly more detail than its predecessor and even more accurate lighting and shadows, and countless more particles for explosions and gore. And remarkably, it runs even faster than id Tech 6. A year after launch, Doom Eternal was updated to support Nvidia's DLSS AI-powered upscaler and frame generation technologies, along with ray-traced reflections, to allow all surfaces to reflect the environment correctly. Ray tracing would be used exclusively for lighting and shadowing in the only other game to use id Tech 7,Indiana Jones and The Great Circle—MachineGames, once again—and this almost certainly laid the foundation for the next iteration of id Tech. And so we come toDoom: The Dark Agesand its id Tech 8 engine—a prequel to the 2016 Doom game but with all the graphical enhancements that MachineGames' Indiana Jones offered. With ray tracing used all the time, and with no shader-based fallback system for GPUs without ray tracing hardware, id Tech 8 was never going to be as speedy as its predecessor, but it still runs pretty well, all things considered. We're still learning more about what id Tech 8 has underneath the hood, as id Software has been pretty quiet about its new engine, but we do know that Doom: The Dark Ages will be patched in the near future to support path tracing. This is a method of ray tracing that produces the most physically accurate lighting, shadows, reflections, and refractions, but as any PC gamer who's tried will tell you, the hardware demands are incredibly high. Naturally, it will mean that upscaling—and perhaps even frame generation—will be an absolute must, and it also means that id Software will need to ensure id Tech 8's denoiser algorithm is top-notch, too. The slower pace of Doom: The Dark Ages compared to Doom 2016 and Doom Eternal means that the outright frame rate won't be quite as important as it is in those games, but given id Software's track record of developing extremely performant engines of late, we're pretty confident that path tracing will be worth enabling. Assuming you have the PC hardware for it, of course! With a gap of four to five years between each release of a new id Tech engine, we're obviously not going to see another one until the end of this decade. That's sufficient time to allow for two more generations of new GPUs, and if you compare today's graphics processors to those from 2020, we can maybe judge what id Tech 9 will bring to the table. AMD and Nvidia's latest chips directly use AI to improve performance and image quality, through upscaling, frame generation, and denoising, but the latter also introduced the concept ofneural renderingwith the launch of its RTX 50 series. Five years ago, AMD launched its first ray-tracing capable GPUs—the Radeon RX 6000 series—and Nvidia released its second generation of RTX chips, the 30 series. Back then, there was no frame generation, no AI-based denoising. Neural rendering was still in its infancy of research. This suggests that by 2030, id Tech 9 could be making use of AI to improve the quality of its graphics, to make them ever more realistic, all while keeping the performance as high as possible. The next Doom or Quake game could be permanently path-traced, perhaps always using upscaling, too. But whatever we do get, id Software's long history of creating graphically-intensive games means that we can be sure that we'll be in for a visual treat. Although the id Tech engine is no longer the one to watch fornewrendering technologies—everything in Doom: The Dark Ages has been done before—it still sets the bar when it comes to optimised performance. Now, how many game engines can you saythatabout? Nick, gaming, and computers all first met in 1981, with the love affair starting on a Sinclair ZX81 in kit form and a book on ZX Basic. He ended up becoming a physics and IT teacher, but by the late 1990s decided it was time to cut his teeth writing for a long defunct UK tech site. He went on to do the same at Madonion, helping to write the help files for 3DMark and PCMark. After a short stint working at Beyond3D.com, Nick joined Futuremark (MadOnion rebranded) full-time, as editor-in-chief for its gaming and hardware section, YouGamers. After the site shutdown, he became an engineering and computing lecturer for many years, but missed the writing bug. Cue four years at TechSpot.com and over 100 long articles on anything and everything. He freely admits to being far too obsessed with GPUs and open world grindy RPGs, but who isn't these days?

    "article_text": "Take down Caligo, Miasma of Night, to finish the Fissure in the Fog expedition. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. WhileFissure in the Fogis at the bottom of the expeditions list inElden Ring Nightreign, you might want to tackle it right after Tricephalos or Gaping Jaw, as it's on the easier side. That's not to say it's easy, though—it'sFromSoftware, did you expect anything less than cruel? To tick off another of theElden Ring Nightreign Nightlord bossesoff your hitlist, you'll need to knowhow to beat Caligo. You'll need to prepare a few things to face this ancient ice dragon, which I'll go over below, but getting to grips with thebest rune farming routesandlegendary weaponsis a good place to start. Before I get into tips for beating Caligo specifically, here's how to best prepare for him during the first two sections of the Fissure in the Fog expedition: Caligo is an ice dragon, so—if you know anything about the elements in games—this beast is weak to fire damage. Getting a fire damage weapon should be your top priority, since you'll deal bonus damage. Being a dragon, Caligo is also weak to items that increase dragon damage, such as Dragonwound Grease. The good news is that fire weapons are generally the easiest to come by. You can use the map overlay to find locations that reward fire affinity gear, or you can visitmerchant locationssince these vendors are guaranteed to sell at least one item with the boss' weakness. You can also get relics that apply fire to your starter weapon, including the unique relic you get for beatingGladius, and upgrade them by findingsmithing stone locations. Thebest Wylder buildis also very good at dealing fire damage, thanks to various unique relics that affect his abilities. On the other hand, you could use thebest Recluse buildand make the most of fire spells, incantations, and Magic Cocktails. Shifting Earth events can be tricky to guarantee and pin down, but the Mountaintop variation is tailor-made for taking down Caligo. By fighting (or running) through the many dragon bosses on the way up the freezing peaks (which are weak to fire as well), you can earn the Favor of the Mountaintop blessing. This halves frostbite damage and frost buildup, while nearby frostbite boosts your own attack power. In other words, it makes Caligo's main strength much less scary. It also adds a bonus damage effect to attacks against dragons. Being a frost dragon, Caligo deals a lot of frost damage, which can lead to frostbite, removing a significant chunk of your health. To counter this, alongside the Mountaintop blessing mentioned above, you should also pick up any items or buffs that increase your resistance to frost damage, such as Thawfrost Boluses, or the Stalwart Horn Charm if you find it as a talisman. You'll want to be at least level ten, if not more, before you fight Caligo, so earn as many runes as you can and take out expedition bosses along the way for passive upgrades. You should also pick up all the flask charges you can by visiting churches. Beating the Miasma of Night starts with your choice of Nightfarer. Despite having four wings, Caligo isn't nearly as mobile as other bosses; it'll often stay in one place for a bit before moving. Because of this, melee characters can be a good choice, but Caligo's ice powers also make that tricky if you're not careful. I'd recommend the following characters: With the right team assembled and the correct gear gathered, it's time to face the Miasma of Night. Here are some tips to beat Caligo in Fissure in the Fog: Alongside the usual whacks and bites, Caligo has five main attacks that you'll need to counter: Staying near Caligo's head makes it much easier to avoid a rogue wing attack, while also giving you a clear view of the boss so you can avoid breath attacks and tail whips more easily. However, in phase two, Caligo introduces more AoE ice attacks that cover the ground, so you'll have to move around a bit more to avoid them. Whatever you do, avoid standing directly underneath Caligo, as this often causes it to fly into the air or use ice breath to force you away, risking frostbite. As mentioned earlier, Caligo is weak to fire. Given its massive health bar, this is more a fight of endurance than anything else, so passively boosting your damage is much-needed to wrap it up quicker. The longer you're fighting, the more opportunities to mess up and the more flasks you'll use. With tons of AoE damage, especially in phase two, ranged weapons are the way to go since you can chip away at Caligo without as much risk. However, keep in mind that Caligo will use more ranged attacks if you're further away, so having one melee character to keep the boss grounded is a smart move.

    "article_text": "It sounds like we are almost there. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In a completely unsurprising turn of events, Semiwork haspublished another video about REPO's first update. With that said, it looks like these video diaries are coming to an end, since this week's episode began with an apology directed toward players voicing their desperation for any sort of release date, and the caption \"we are in the home stretch now\" on Steam. Not long after REPO's release on February 26, videos regarding the game's first update started being published to the semiwork YouTube channel, with the first rolling out on March 7. At first these videos were exciting little looks at new content, like the cart cannon,expressions, and even the announcement of anopen beta test for the update. However, despite all these chances to give us a date to look forward to, semiwork has always avoided providing an answer to the question we've all been asking: When's it coming? After nearly two months of weekly updates, I'm happy to report that we, uh, still don't know. But hey, here's some more upgrades to get excited about! The first of which being Tumble Wings. If you equip this upgrade andtumble launchfrom a high place, your semibot will sprout two little fairy wings, carrying you slowly to the ground to avoid taking any fall damage. For levels like the museum, which is being rolled out as part of the update, this will be incredibly helpful given how many high platforms you'll need to parkour up to gather valuables. The second upgrade touched on was stamina regeneration when crouching. This has been a highly requested feature since the game was released, so most players will be thrilled. As confirmed in the video, you'll also be able to buy upgrades for this in the shop, which I imagine speeds up your regeneration even further. Another new item was introduced as well, called the Phase Bridge. Although it wasn't shown in too much detail, it looks to be an extendable bridge you can use to finally step foot in those hard-to-reach places around levels. When showing off this feature, Semiwork gave players a full licence to mess around \"we are very excited to see how you might break the game using it. So go wild with it.\" In case you didn't fancy continuing to wait for the update, all of these features are available in the open beta too, alongside things like team discounts for health packs and energy crystals. Hopefully, these features won't be confined to the open beta for long. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Kara is an evergreen writer.

    "article_text": "With two cities remaining, Helldivers have held the line. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's official—grab your special someone and fill out your C-01 permit—Super Earth is saved. After a gruelling 11-day campaign, the players of Helldivers 2 have finally emerged victorious in a pitched battle against the Illuminate. As an official in-game announcement reads, Prosperity City and Equality-on-Sea were the last bastions to remain—the latter of which caused somebizarre review bombingsfrom players who, best I can tell, didn't understand that the objective was toholdplanets until the major order was over. The fact that players managed to cap Equality-on-Sea's liberation percentage at 99.9783% is mightily impressive, but I don't know if it was grounds for Arrowhead to completely change how its event was designed in the 11th hour. The heart of democracy was held over almost two straight weeks of fighting, which saw the loss of the cities Eagleopolis, Remembrance, York Supreme, Port Mercy, and Administrative Centre 02 (just down the road from Administrative Centre 02 Final Ver). This included jaunts to Automaton-controlled planets to secure scrap for the Democratic Space Station, as well as a brief defense of a Terminid-infested planet to make sure some malware could make its way into the Illuminate fleet. You can see a full play-by-play, shared by Arrowhead in-game, below. Oh—also, the Super Earth president died, apparently while \"defending the Presidential Security bunker with only a pistol against waves of Illuminate foes\". Don't worry, though, Super Earth has elected a new one in short order via the dystopian wonders of managed democracy. As someone who has very muchenjoyed getting my boots on the ground(I am, as they say, doing my part) it really is cool to see Arrowhead finally delivering on the promise of the Galactic War. Desperate last stands, keeping one planet alive through the entire invasion against all odds, and plenty of meme-able hijinks, plus the actual, genuine threat of Super Earth falling. What comes next, though, is anybody's guess, now that Arrowhead's able to set the stakes this high. Will the Automaton fleet come for Super Earth next? Might we lose the Galactic War in the future and, if so, what then? One thing's for certain, as the Super Earth news broadcast shown above states: Aliens aren't scary.

    "title": "How to emote in Elden Ring Nightreign",
    "article_text": "Emotes and Prattling Pates are your only form of communication. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Although it's a dedicated multiplayer game,Elden Ring Nightreignoddly overlooks all the bells and whistles that you'd expect; there's no voice or text chat whatsoever. However, Nightreign also doesn't skimp on the challenge, so communication is key. Like a caveman, you're going to have to knowhow to emoteand use gestures to get your point across. Maybe you're trying to tell your team to take thebest rune farming route? You could point forward. Or perhaps you've finally managed to beat one of theNightreign bossesand want to celebrate? Celebrate with triumphant delight or even jump for joy. You can use gestures and emotes in Nightreign byopening your inventory and pressing \"1\" on keyboard or triangle/Y on controller. This'll open the emote tab, where you can select from a bunch of different gestures (just by clicking on them or pressing cross/A) to fit your mood. Since emotes play a short animation, just be careful when you use them—it would be rather embarrassing to die while emoting. You canget more gestures by visiting the Small Jar Bazaarin the Roundtable Hold. While buying thebest relicsis certainly a higher priority, for 200 Murk each, you can also buy a handful of emotes and even Prattling Pates, which make your character speak in a funny voice and convey vital information such as \"Please help!\" and \"You're beautiful\". While they are generally dangerous to use in combat, I've found a rare occurrence where emotes are actually beneficial. Yeah…it's as weird and awkward as it sounds. The Night of the Demon unique relic you'll earn for beating Libra in the Equilibrious Beast expedition, builds up madness when you use the crossed legs gesture. This plays into various madness-related builds you can do, if you're up for emoting in combat Monster Hunter-style.

    "title": "Elden Ring Nightreign's best feature is its extra mobility—but it's not even that good, and Sekiro does it better",
    "article_text": "Also, I really miss my dumb goat-horse. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Elden Ring Nightreignhas a few fans in the hallowed halls of PC Gamer, but I confess that I am not among them. It's a rare fail forFromSoftware—a studio that almost exclusively designs games that I should hate, as a lazy man with a low tolerance for adversity, but which I usually end up loving. What I have been kinda enjoying, though, is the extra mobility this spin-off affords us. Nightreign lets you sprint like an only slightly more sluggish version of the Flash, jump up walls, jumpoffwalls, and in the case of the Wylder, you can use your grappling hook to quickly close the gap when engaging in combat. It is a brisker, more agile version ofElden Ring, but rather than being empowering this feels like an absolute necessity. Nightreign swaps the thoughtful, slow-burn pace of its originator for the hectic speed of a battle royale, complete with shrinking battlefield and that perpetual sense that, whenever I am not moving, I am just wasting time. I've found this to be an absolutely terrible way to experience Elden Ring's tricky bouts and savage boss fights. There were multiple times while playing with colleagues where we had to give up on a fight we were absolutely winning, not because we were out of flasks or close to death, but because of some arbitrary bullshit: a big blue wall was heading our way. The one enemy we could not defeat. Plenty of folk will vibe with this. Our reviewer Tyler Colpfound a lot to love about it. But lots of people also really vibe with mods that utterly ruin games I love unmodified. And this is what Nightreign feels like: a bad mod that craps all over a previously refined experience. And all the bits that I have to acknowledge I do quite like, such as the enhanced mobility, come with so many caveats. We don't have Torrent now, for instance. So while, yes, you can run around at breakneck speeds, it doesn't feel quite as speedy as when you were charging around on your goat-horse hammering the dash button. \"Feel\" is the operative word here. We've gone back to Elden Ring to compare the speeds, and the Nightreign sprint might actually be faster, or at least comparable. But there's an exhilarating sense of speed that Torrent provides that's not quite matched in Nightreign. And Torrent was more than a means of transport—he changed the way you could enter combat, giving you more tactical options like cool dismounting jump attacks and driveby swipes that we've now lost in his absence. Torrent was more than a means of transport. Regardless, it's nice to be able to sprint like an absolute maniac. The jumping, though, makes me a different kind of maniac. An angry, infuriated one. The wall jumping is janky and inconsistent, and while that wouldn't be too much of an issue in vanilla Elden Ring, in Nightreign, where you've got a blue wall of death nipping at your heels, it becomes more serious and more frustrating. When every second counts, the last thing you need is for your bird-man with useless wings to get stuck trying to jump up a wall that's only slightly taller than himself. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. When it does work, though, it's actually quite exhilarating. You've got seconds to get to another flask, or another boss, both of which are necessary to get you all set for your final encounter at the end of the three days; so you're sprinting across the plains, weaving between trash mobs, leaping up cliffs, relentless in your pursuit of more power. There are times when the race, and the tools you've got at your disposal to help you win it, offer a sense of excitement that's entirely different from the traditional FromSoftware experience. And that's a thrill. But those moments are rare. FromSoftware has already experimented with action like this previously, and with better results. Sekiro, for instance, gives you an infinite sprint and a frankly ridiculous amount of mobility. The joy I feel from grappling away from an enemy, leaping from trees to rooftops to reposition and find a new angle of attack, or simply to escape an encounter I'm not ready for, it's like nothing else in the realm of soulslikes. Sure, the Wylder's grappling hook feels novel in Elden Ring, but it's got nothing on its counterpart from Sekiro. It's a much simpler tool, and while you can use it on terrain as well as enemies, you ain't no ninja. You'll be using it to quickly reposition in a pinch rather than constantly deploying it to get around the world. Here's the thing: Nightreign isn't FromSoftware running a bold experiment. Thatwould beexciting. In reality, it features a bunch of things that both the team's done before and better, while awkwardly jamming in some Fortnite junk. Beyond the extra mobility, everything it does well belongs to Elden Ring, and most of the enjoyment it provides stems from the fact that it's actually pretty hard to have a shit time playing a game with your buds. Co-op is just inherently fun. But Nightreign isn't. Fraser is the UK online editor and has actually met The Internet in person.

    "article_text": "Bold of you to assume I have friends, From. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Is this a safe space? Can I make a confession? I still haven't finishedElden Ring. In fact, I've yet to make much further than Margit. For all the hours I sunk into The Lands Between, it never quite got its hooks into me. I'll go back and give it another shot some day, but there's a part of me that wonders if I might just be kind of done with Souls-style games for a while. Sekiro 2, though? I'd eat that up in a nanosecond. But I don't think most people are with me in that regard. I wonder if most people would much rather FromSoft stuck to making what it does best. That'd certainly explain the current Steam reviews for Elden Ring Nightreign, which came out yesterday and quickly became FromSoft's worst-reviewed game on Steam. Now, don't get too alarmed, we're not talking the doldrums of an Overwhelmingly Negative score here or anything; Nightreign is currently Mixed, with 66% of its user reviews coming in positive. Not terrible by any stretch, but lower than any other game in the FromSoft catalogue. Only one thing under its name—Dark Souls 3's Ashes of Ariandel DLC—scores lower: 59% positive. As full games go, Nightreign is bottom of the table. It's not surprising. I've not touched Nightreign myself, but it's been controversial here on the PCG team. Some of us are dead keen, others are iffy, and even those in the former camp took a little while to come around. Our reviewer, Tyler Colp, was positive in hisElden Ring Nightreign review, but admitted its experimental, multiplayer-focused gameplay made it a stranger, messier thing than its predecessors. It's no shock to see that same division play out on Steam. \"This is not the Elden Ring game you are looking for,\" reads one. \"Immediately got crushed by Fell Omen in under a minute. 10/10 Elden Ring experience,\" says another. I'll be curious to see if opinion turns more positive as people get some time to adjust to the game, or if From stalwarts just won't take to its co-op trappings like they have to the studio's previous work. Perhaps it's fated to be bottom of the leaderboards forever. Well, unless and untilDuskbloodsgets a PC release.

    "title": "Phanteks Eclipse G400A review",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A great PC case for a beginner to PC gaming, or just someone who cares about maximising airflow on a budget. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. Phanteks has put together a mighty strong proposition in the Phanteks Eclipse G400A. It's affordable, easy to build into, and importantly comes with four large fans for plenty of airflow. To give the Eclipse G400A a proper test, I set about building an affordable PC inside it. Easier said than done in today's economy, but I just about managed to get it done for areasonablebudget. You can read all about that in ourbudget build guide, but I took away from that experience a very positive outlook on everything the Phanteks G400A has to offer. The G400A's frame is machined well with few sharp edges and clean corners. The case I received had no visible marks on any of the panels, which you'd think would be a given with a brand new case, but scratches can and do happen in transit with poor packaging. There's only a small box of accessories included with the G400A, though Phanteks has been extremely generous by putting 30 zip-ties in there—count 'em, 30! It also has the prerequisite screws for the motherboard, PSU, HDD, and a couple extras. It's a similarly priced unit, at $110/£85, to theCorsair Frame 4000Dwith fans. Both have their pros and cons. The Corsair is a better-looking case in my opinion, though it also has panel flex (which I'm told might go away soon as Corsair moves to thicker metal). The Phanteks is built like a tank and has one more fan than Corsair and they're all the larger 140 mm variety. Form factor:Mid-towerMotherboard support:E-ATX (up to 280 mm), ATX, Micro-ATX, Mini-ITXStorage bays:2x 2.5-inch, 2x 3.5-inchFront IO:2x USB Type-A, 1x USB Type-C, 3.5 mm, power + resetFan support:7x 120 mm/6x 140 mmRadiator support:360 mm max (top), 120 mm max (rear)GPU clearance:415 mmWeight:8.63 kgDimensions:495 L x 230 W x 522 H mmPrice:$110/£85 Where this case really shines as an affordable, almost budget, chassis is in fan selection. There are four M25-140 Gen2 D-RGB fans included on the G400A. These are not your basic case fans. Case in point, a single fan would cost you around £10 if you were to buy it separately. These are some of Phantek's latest, with strong stats and lit up to the nines with RGB-lit blades and an infinity mirror effect on the central fan hub. These fans are connected together using a proprietary connector, which combines PWM fan control and RGB control together. It's pretty easy to daisy chain more of these fans together, terminating in the standard PWM and A-RGB headers using an adapter cable, though you shouldn't have to worry about that. The case comes pre-wired and ready to go, and the four fans fill out the case with enough cooling that you shouldn't have to worry about installing any more. A dust filter covers the front of the case for all three fans. It has a relatively small impact on the airflow through the front of the case when installed, however, once combined with the mesh front panel does stack up to become a bit more of a hindrance. Using an anemometer, I measured airflow to be at around 1.9 m/s with the dust filter and front panel fitted, 2.2 m/s with only the dust filter, and 2.3 m/s without either. That's more than some I've tested, but even so, I'm not too worried about airflow in this case with those three 140 mm fans loaded in the front. I opted for an air cooler for my test build,Arctic's Freezer 36, though you could just as easily fit up to a 360 mm radiator inside the top of the Phanteks G400A, and without moving around any fans. The top mesh panel pops off the case for easier access and there's easily enough room for a standard thickness radiator between it and the top of the motherboard once fitted. The Phanteks is quite generously sized all-round at 495 L x 230 W x 522 H mm. It didn't feel quite as spacious as theBe Quiet! Shadow Base 800 FX, but it's as easy to build into. Along the bottom of the case is a PSU shroud with plenty of room for cables. The PSU sits in the rear and in front of it is the storage bracket for any 2.5-inch or 3.5-inch drives you might have. I didn't have any, which means I could have removed this storage bracket entirely if I wanted to, but I had such a gluttony of room under the shroud that I left it in. The PSU shroud is where Phantek's sought to apply the only dab of flair to the entire build, bar the RGB fans. There's a light strip that runs the length of the PSU shroud. It's diffused, which looks so much better than a strip with obvious LEDs, and it's easily controllable in-line with the fans through the motherboard. In my case, via ASRock's RGB software. The cable management on the rear is a real boon to the G400A, too. It's a smart system that ditches the usual channels and ties for a velcro loop system. It sounds pretty pedestrian, but the way the velcro loops around makes it much easier to thread through new cables or remove it and replace, without undoing all your hard work cable managing. This is great for beginners, especially if you're prone to running a few extra cables or reworking your system to get it just right. ✅ You want top airflow for less:This case comes with four M25-140 Gen2 D-RGB fans, and if you ignore most of that name, the important bit is the '140', for 140 mm. That means slower spinning fans, less noise, but plenty of airflow. ❌ You want the *aesthetic*:The G400A is a pretty standard-looking case. There's an RGB light strip, sure, but otherwise it's something you stuff parts into and game on. No frills, no shiny glass box, both of which you could get for a little more money. My only concern with the rear cable management is that the right-most side of the chassis, traditionally where your CPU power cables go, only offers a few tabs to loop a zip-tie around to secure any cables going that way. But it's times like these where it's important not to forget the 30 zip-ties included in the box of those in the box so you can cut and reconnect many times over without running out. The G400A is certainly not the flashiest case on the market. You could spend a similar amount on just a case, no fans, on the likes of thePhanteks Evolv X2orLian Li O11 Vision Compact. Both of which are some of the best-looking glass boxes around. But you won't quite get the affordability of four 140 mm fans included in the box, and that's what Phanteks has got absolutely right with the G400A. It's a wonderfully easy option for first-time buyers. That's really the strongest argument for the G400A: if you're set to brave your first PC build ever (don't worry, it's not that bad), this is a superb choice. You have all the case cooling you need already wired up and ready to go, there's ample room for a power supply and no tight connections or corners to work with in the rare occurrence you have to troubleshoot. A great PC case for a beginner to PC gaming, or just someone who cares about maximising airflow on a budget. Jacob earned his first byline writing for his own tech blog.

    "article_text": "The mad lads are gonna do it. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Modding project Tamriel Rebuilt's quest to make therestof Morrowind continues apace, even over two decades after it began. The team has just releasedGrasping Fortune, its biggest expansion yet, bringing with it the sprawling city of Narsis. As House Hlaalu capital, Narsis took years to put together and features over 600 interiors, which means itdwarfs every other playable city in every Elder Scrolls game. So, obviously, it's nearly time to make an even bigger city. TR's next expansion will \"start introducing parts of the Indoril heartland right outside of [Morrowind's capital] Almalexia,\" says TR senior dev Cicero in a chat with PCG, \"And I think Almalexia might be on the cards of opening up development really soon as well… I think we might be doing it in the next few years.\" As Morrowind's capital and home to the mortal-turned-goddess who shares its name, Almalexia makes even Narsis look like some podunk hamlet. \"Almalexia is kind of like two cities,\" says Cicero, \"and just looking at our math, it's about twice the size of Narsis. It might not be quite as dense as Narsis, just for our sanity and also for performance, but it's gonna be twice as widespread, and it will have more buildings, for sure.\" Of course, an interesting wrinkle is that Almalexia—part of Almalexia—is already in the base game. Morrowind's Tribunal expansion takes place in Mournhold, located in Almalexia, which means the TR team will have to do a touch of light surgery to integrate that official content into its eventual expanded version of Almalexia as a whole, raising questions about preserving Bethesda's work and intent. \"The idea is we wouldn't delete anything,\" says Cicero, but Mournhold as it stands is built in a finicky way: \"Mournhold itself is in what's called a fake exterior… it's just meshes in an interior cell with a skybox.\" In other words, it's an inside pretending to be an outside. \"You can't really have that if you want to incorporate it into the actual mainland… it has to be implanted into Almalexia within the same worldspace, and things would have to be spread around.\" So a bit of Bethesda's work might end up shuffled—King Helseth's castle might have to take a jaunt to a new bit of the province, some NPCs would have to be scattered around, farther apart. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. One of the things I admire about TR is its determination to expand Morrowind just as Bethesda would have done it, so I'm very curious to see how it navigates transplanting Mournhold into its expanded Almalexia. As creature animator Grumbling Vomit told me, even on such a venerable and large project: \"The biggest challenges are always interpersonal. The talent is present, but the talent doesn't always agree. Even something small like the name of a city can cause debates… it shows just how much care is put into even the smallest of details.\" When it comes to Morrowind's capital, there are a whole bunch of small details to consider. I'm excited to see how TR approaches them.

This was announced in a recentWeChat post, alongside additional guarantees to \"carry out detailed and comprehensive software and hardware testing and driver optimization work.\" According toTom's Hardware, the 6 nm GPU chip is targeting RTX 4060-level performance, and is currently titled the G100. Lisuan has reportedly been working on the G100 since 2023, with plans to launch it in 2023, so there is a level of skepticism around whether or not it can actually hit thatRTX 4060performance level. Despite being a budget card from the last generation, the RTX 4060 is still an impressive card, built on the 5 nm process from TSMC. The smaller the process, the higher the density of transistors, and this results in better performance and efficiency. Effectively, it's harder (and sometimes impossible) to get the same performance out of older processes. The G100 powering on is a good sign for the card, but it's the first of many steps before it can actually see a launch into the Chinese market. Further optimising and just plain testing is needed, especially as it's targeting \"the needs of desktops, notebooks, graphic workstations and other devices.\" Huang tellsBloomberg, \"The Chinese competitors have evolved\" and Huawei, with its new AI chips, has become \"quite formidable.\" Given that the domestic ability to create processes for the G100 is quite limited, it is likely that Huawei's Ascend 920 and Lisuan's G100 are using silicon from the same Chinese foundry: SMIC. This is all according to estimations from Tom's Hardware. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. According to Huang, “Like everybody else, they [Chinese companies] are doubling, quadrupling capabilities every year.\" This is all to build towards a central point that Huang wants \"all of the world's AI researchers and all of the world's developers to be building on American stacks\". This is reportedly \"irrespective of the near-term revenue success that we have\", though opening up sales to a bigger market surely can't hurt the hardware giant.

    "title": "A game claiming the backing of Russia's military just popped up on Steam: 'I understand Ukrainian players don't like us'",
    "article_text": "Many are calling for Squad 22: ZOV to be pulled from Steam. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A new game hit Steam yesterday—Squad 22: ZOV. Claiming to be \"officially recommended by the Russian Military for use as a basic infantry tactic manual for cadet and Yunarmy [Russia's state organisation for young army cadets] training\" and set in the ongoing war in Ukraine, Squad 22 puts you in command of teams of Russian troops as they fight the Ukrainian Armed Forces, take prisoners, and rescue hostages. It is the only release by either developer SPN Studio or publisher Zarobana Entertainment, and claims to present \"history as it is,\" inviting potential players to \"delve into the complexities of the 2014 and 2022-2024 events [the annexation of Crimea and invasion of Ukraine, respectively] through compelling campaigns.\" The developer says it has designed the game based on \"insights from Russian veterans and active soldiers,\" some of whom it names on theSquad 22 website. The Russian military is currently subject to an International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine. Russian president Vladimir Putin is subject to an ICC arrest warrant for the unlawful deportation of Ukrainian children. As you might imagine, the apparently sanitised view of Russia's role in the war that Squad 22 depicts has stirred controversy. Ukrainians and non-Ukrainians alike have denounced the game as Russian war propaganda that should have no place on Steam. The Ukrainian state's Centre for Countering Disinformation called the game \"Russian propaganda\" as long ago as last year, while the game's Steam reviews currently sit at a Mixed rating, asusersdescribe it with phrases like \"an ethical abomination that deserves universal condemnation.\" More than a few users on social media call forSquad 22 to be removed from Steamand, indeed, ask how it ever got there in the first place. I reached out to SPN to ask about the process of getting onto Steam, and lead dev Alexander Tolkach told me that the game \"went through [a] very long moderation process. Valve's team literally requested access to all in-game content and checked it for about 60 days,\" as compared to what Tolkach calls a more usual \"5-7 days' timing.\" Tolkach says the devs were careful to \"feature only legal things inside—after all, it is just a tactical game, not a long text-rich quest, and all our art is checked not to feature any extremes of violence,\" so it passed. I've reached out to Valve to ask if that's a fair description of the process, and I'll update this piece if I hear back. Tolkach told me that the idea for Squad 22 \"came from GVPU,\"Russia's Military-Political Directorate, but says funding came from \"our own savings and in majority by a private investor. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"I was contacted by a GVPU representative, saying they are looking for a team who would dare to try such a project. I said that I have a number of ideas in my head, but we'd need to find money for that to set up a studio. They answered they can't help us with money, but will help [by] providing any meaningful info for the game. Well, in the end… that helped to find a sponsor.\" Tolkach also claims that money spent on Squad 22 doesn't filter back to the Russian military: \"All proceeds from the game go to pay out team salaries while continuing to improve the game. If we earn more than needed, we will invest in a new game project.\" I find that a little hard to believe, personally, but without a dev or member of the Russian military saying otherwise, it's all we have to go on. At the very least, you'd think Russian members of the dev team are going to be paying income tax to the state. Regardless, all of these details just elide the issue that the game is set in an ongoing war that's destroyed huge swathes of Ukraine and harmed millions of Ukrainians. It might not technically violate Steam's terms of service, but it certainly leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Tolkach says he understands that: \"Of course it is problematic. I understand why 99% of game developers stick to either long past (up to WWII) or fictional settings. And I understand Ukrainian players don't like us. \"Maybe it'd be logical if Steam closes game sales for Ukraine, as they, by the way, did for Russia… But we have the right to tell the stories of our people. As a game designer and producer I always took maximum care to verify as much as possible that we put in only facts and ideas we know are real. \"I don't think you can deny that Western media are flooded with [a lot of] disinformation… So, we have all rights to defend our dignity and show the world how we see this conflict and, more importantly, why it actually began.\" True or not, I doubt many players will be willing to take the word of a game that claims the backing of Russia's own military at face value.

    "article_text": "Sif's looking a little more yoked nowadays. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Elden Ring Nightreign's not debuting to the best of review scores from users—which is hardly surprising. I'm really starting to rather enjoy myself after 19 hours, but it took a minute to get adjusted to the sheer, unrestrained chaos ofFromSoftware's most experimental game to date. That hasn't stopped it from hitting the Steam concurrent charts like Radahn doing his terrifying meteor move, though. PerSteamDB,Elden RingNightreign debuted to a massive 300,000 players. It's since dwindled to 150,000, though some fluctuation is to be expected. Mind, that is a pretty considerable drop. If I'm to compare that to Helldivers 2 at the peak of its heyday, it took over a month for the game's concurrent player count to halve. So what gives? In ourElden Ring Nightreign review, PC Gamer's Tyler Colp aptly calls it one of FromSoftware's most peculiar and abrasive games since the '90s—and I'd concur with that assessment. Nightreign doesn't permit the slow, patient, methodical digestion of mechanics you'd get in any mainline souls game, where you're given the blessed opportunity to to fight, die, repeat against a mountain until it finally crumbles before you. Instead it's more of a pressure cooker—especially if you're playing solo, which I don't recommend unless you're a complete masochist. My first few games of Nightreign were infuriating, confusing, and felt like a complete mess. It took me a few goes around on FromSoftware's wild ride before I started to actuallygetit. I'm not shocked that 150,000 people have (temporarily) bounced off. It doesn't help that a lot of the things that help the game's progression makesense—new bowls for your relics, remembrance challenges, and so on—are gated behind knocking over the firstNightlord. Whether they dust themselves off and go in for another round, though, remains to be seen.

    "title": "This movie is fully AI-generated and has a fully SAG-AFTRA cast – here’s 3 things you need to know about Echo Hunter",
    "article_text": "Virtual films made real When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There’s a memorable moment in the new sci-fi short filmEcho Hunterwhere a clone hunter starts questioning his place in a morally bankrupt world with blurred lines between man and machine. It feels particularly pointed since AI models generate all of the footage forEcho Hunter. Echo Hunterwas created by Arcana Labs and written and directed by filmmaker Kavan Cardoza (better known as “Kavan the Kid”). However, unlike any other major AI-produced film, it features a fully unionized cast of SAG-AFTRA actors. You can see a bit of how it came together in the behind-the-scenes video below, but there are a few key things to know aboutEcho Hunterand its AI origins. Clocking in at under 30 minutes, Echo Hunter isn’t just a tech demo; it's an actual story with a narrative, cohesive visual style, and directorial control. The plot isn't exactly unique; shades ofBlade Runner, Ghost in the Shell,andThe Matrixare hard to avoid in a story about a clone hunter in a dystopian future who begins to unravel when memories of a forgotten life start surfacing. Existential thrillers with sci-fi flavor and a moody synth score are familiar, but the entire thing being generated using AI models is not. Arcana Labs developed the eponymous AI model behind the film. The idea was to demonstrate that a high-quality movie could be made without hundreds of millions of dollars and a year in Atlanta. The director and his team fed performance data, audio, and prompts into the system, and Arcana AI did the heavy lifting of designing visuals, rendering scenes, and creating a coherent movie. Echo Hunter's producers are keen to say they aren't trying to replace actors or sidestep their union. Breckin Meyer leads a fully paid-up group of union performers, including Taylor John Smith, Danielle Bisutti, Gedeon Burkhard, Hanna Balicki, and Xander Bailey. Their voices, performances, and likenesses are central to the experience. Their voices are attached to AI-generated virtual versions of themselves. If Kavan the Kid rings any bells, you may be familiar with his pioneering experiments with AI-produced short films. He's gone viral with very unauthorized but still impressive-looking shorts likeStar Wars: The Ghost ApprenticeandBatman: A Face of Clay, each seen by millions of people and propelling him to notoriety for AI-based filmmaking, for better or worse.Echo Hunterfits well with both his style and technical expertise, which makes sense since he both directed and wrote the film. But it's far from a one-man show this time. Arcana producedEcho Hunterin collaboration with Phantom X, with Arcana co-founder Jonathan Yunger as executive producer. Counting them and the cast, it's still a fraction of the hundreds of people necessary for an equivalent production without AI. Arcana argues this is a positive as it reduces the amount of money and resources that prevent filmmakers from making the kinds of movies they want to make. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. But, while it's good that the cast is unionized and paid and treated accordingly, it raises questions about the future of the many other hard-working and talented people who make epic, large-scale films. That's something to consider, even if AI flawlessly executed filmmaking requests every time without plenty of the finessing and fine-tuning that madeEcho Hunterlook as good as it does. AndEcho Hunter, flaws and all,shows that this isn't a far-off theoretical question to consider. Studios won't shut down all their productions in favor of AI-created films (with or without human actors) tomorrow or even in the next few years, but there's no way meetings about doing so aren't happening. The ethical implications are real and worth wrestling with, but on the optimistic side, smaller, independent creators now have a lot more options for making films without spending half a million dollars for a five-second shot of a futuristic skyline. And lack of corporate coffers doesn't have to stop a Phoenix-based director from adding rain-slicked streets to their noir film. Including real actors in the union does show that synthetic productions aren't automatically soulless. The human performances, writing, and direction are what make the film engaging. Some might argue that AI just helps fill in the blanks between the dream and the budget. And no AI could perfectly mimic how one of the stars fromFranklin & Bashdelivers an emotional monologue about lost identity in a clone apocalypse.

    "article_text": "Silicon Motion SM2324 simplifies SSD design with fewer components When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Silicon Motion has revealed a potentially transformative piece of storage tech at Computex 2025: theSM2324, a single-chip USB4 SSD controller aimed at powering external drives with up to 32TB of storage and read speeds of 4,000MB/s. The company says the SM2324 combines native USB4 support with an integrated Power Delivery controller, meaning fewer parts, reduced costs for OEMs, and more compact SSD enclosures. This could, in theory, usher in a new class of ultra-high-capacity portable drives -though affordability and availability are still big questions. Unlike multi-chip designs, it’s built to simplify production without compromising on performance, thanks to sequential write speeds that can reach 3,809MB/s -assuming cooling is adequate. It also offers full support for 3D TLC and QLC NAND, as well as compatibility with Power Delivery 3.1, and is built using TSMC’s 12nm low-power node to keep power demands reasonable. With support for up to 32TB and compatibility with Windows, macOS, Linux, and evenAppleProRes workflows on iPhones, the controller clearly targets a wide market -everyone from mobile filmmakers to enterprise backup users. Whether it ends up in the drives competing forbest portable hard driveorbest SSDstatus depends not just on its specs, but on how it's implemented. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Still, there are caveats. While single-chip simplicity lowers BOM costs, there's no promise that 32TB USB4 SSDs based on the SM2324 will be priced for mainstream users. NAND prices, thermal management requirements, and power delivery constraints could all push the final product into specialist territory. So while it might eventually sit alongside thebest external SSDoptions in performance, it may not do so in price. This device comes with security features which include support for AES 128/256-bit encryption, hardware SHA-384, a TRNG, and full TCG Opal 2.0 compliance. There’s even optional support for fingerprint-based authentication, though integration details are vague. It also integrates Silicon Motion’s NANDXtend LDPC ECC engine, improving endurance and reliability for both TLC and QLC memory. In terms of design, the chip is compact, just 9mm by 9mm, and includes an aluminum heat spreader, making it viable for slim external enclosures. \"At Silicon Motion, we're focused on delivering SSD controller solutions that lead in both performance and power efficiency,\" said Nelson Duann, Senior VP of Client & Automotive Storage Business at Silicon Motion. \"…the SM2324 redefines portable storage with a fully integrated single-chip USB4 solution.

    "title": "Some data centers are deliberately slowing possibly tens of thousands of AI GPUs to avoid blackouts - but this company may have a solution",
    "article_text": "GPU power spikes are burning your energy bill When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. As artificial intelligence systems grow more demanding, manydata centershave found themselves consuming nearly twice the energy they technically need. This overuse isn’t due to system flaws or outdated hardware, it’s rooted in how GPUs behave, as their power demand can swing drastically within seconds, from full throttle to idle. To cope, operators often deploy dummy loads, deliberate energy wasters, to maintain a stable power draw - but these data centers deliberately slow the performance of tens of thousands of GPUs to prevent power outages While this avoids damage and blackouts, it means up to 45% of energy is lost as heat, performing no useful computation. Skeleton Technologies now claims it may have a more efficient alternative, one that allows GPUs to run at full capacity without overwhelming the grid. The Estonian company developed GrapheneGPU, a peak-shaving system using proprietary Curved Graphene supercapacitors. Unlike lithium-based systems, these capacitors can respond in just 10 microseconds, absorbing energy during idle periods and discharging it instantly when GPU loads spike. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The result, according to Skeleton, is the ability to maintain consistent GPU performance without stressing the grid or resorting to throttling. Their tests suggest the system can deliver up to 40% more FLOPS - floating point operations per second - using the same GPUs, simply by removing the performance penalties associated with thermal de-rating and power instability. “GrapheneGPU delivers up to 40% more computing with the same energy footprint, while cutting both capital and operating costs by reducing grid upgrade needs, energy waste, and cooling,” said Taavi Madiberk, CEO of Skeleton Technologies. “Powered by our patented Curved Graphene, this is a fundamental shift in how AI infrastructure can scale - sustainably and economically”. The company also reports up to a 44% reduction in the power capacity that data centers must reserve from the grid. The core unit, the GrapheneGPU PCS 50, delivers up to 80 kW of peak power in a standard 1OU form factor, compatible with existing infrastructure and cooled by air or liquid. Importantly, it avoids lithium entirely, using Skeleton’s patented graphene-based material instead. According to Skeleton, this technology has been tested under rigorous hyperscaler-grade GPU workloads with positive results. However, it has not been independently tested for real-world performance and durability. The first shipment of this technology will commence in Germany by June 2025. The company also has a U.S. production site planned for early 2026.

ClickFix, an infamous hacking technique that tricks people into runningmalwarethinking they’re fixing a problem on their computer, has evolved, experts have warned. New research from c/side has revealed what used to be a Windows-only attack method is now capable of targeting macOS, iOS and Android devices, as well. In ablog postanalyzing the evolution, the researchers said the new attack starts with a compromised website. The threat actors would inject JavaScript code which redirected users to a new browser tab when they clicked on certain elements on the page. The new tab then displays a page that looks like a legitimate URL shortener, with a message to copy and paste a link into the browser - and doing so triggers yet another redirect, this time to a download page. Here is where the technique diverges, depending on theoperating systemof the victim. On macOS, the attack leads to a terminal command that fetches and executes a malicious shell script, already flagged by multiple antivirus programs. OnAndroidand iOS, things are even worse, since the attack no longer requires any user interaction. “When we tested this on Android and iOS, we expected a ClickFix variant. But instead, we encountered a drive-by attack,” the researchers explained. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! “A drive-by attack is a type of cyberattack where malicious code is executed or downloaded onto a device simply by visiting a compromised or malicious webpage. No clicks, installs, or interaction required.” In this case, the site downloads a .TAR archive file, holding malware. This one, too, was flagged by at least five antivirus programs already. “This is a fascinating and evolving attack that demonstrates how attackers are expanding their reach,” c/side explained. “What started as a Windows-specific ClickFix campaign is now targeting macOS, Android, and iOS, significantly expanding the scale of the operation.” Sead is a seasoned freelance journalist based in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.

It can handle power loads up to 600W and includes real-time power monitoring and an advanced dual-fan cooling system with programmable smart fan control for thermal issue alerts. There is also a back-panel mute button in case the audible alerts get too chatty. Its dimensions are 370mm x 170mm x 88mm, which makes it large enough to house an RTX 5090-class card, but still compact enough not to overwhelm a desk. This setup is aimed at workflows where stability and zero-configuration environments are mandatory - think AI model training,8Kediting, or enterprise-grade rendering pipelines. But in a world where laptops are increasingly equipped with powerful built-in GPUs, this enclosure feels more like a fix for edge cases. A creator looking for thebest laptop for video editingor thebest laptop for Photoshopwill likely find plenty of capable systems that don’t need such a setup, particularly when portability, price, and simplicity are taken into account. That said, as integrated GPUs and compact systems improve, the necessity of such a solution narrows, and the cost significantly increases. You’ll need a PCIe slot in your system, a matching full-power GPU, and a compelling reason to justify the cost - but if you’re dead-set on hauling RTX 5090-class power around without a tower, this might be the only hardware currently up to the job.

    "title": "It’s official, Android users: Instagram is draining your battery, but there's now a fix",
    "article_text": "Don’t let your addiction the ‘Gram suck your phone dry When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Think your Android smartphone’s battery life has been dropping faster than normal recently? The culprit may have been identified. Noticing excessive battery drain in recent weeks, Android users onReddithave been speculating that the Instagram app is responsible. In battery drain comparisons with other apps, Meta’s social media app appeared to be consuming far more of their capacity than it should for the amount of usage. One Redditor, using aSamsungGalaxy A53, noticed that 54 minutes of Instagram screen time used 12.4% of their battery capacity, while 49 minutes ofWhatsAppscreen time used only 2.4%. Google has now stepped in to apparently confirm what many suspected. In anadvisory postentitled “Battery drain on Android devices”, posted on the Android support site, a Google community manager identified Instagram as the cause of said drain, and urged Android users to immediately update their Instagram app. The latest build of the app at the time of writing (build 382.0.0.49.84) appears to resolve the issue, so if you’ve been noticing your smartphone losing battery power faster than expected, it’s well worth ensuring that you’ve downloaded this update. Of course, there are lots of other ways to extend your battery life. These range from putting unused apps to sleep (go to Settings > Battery > Background Usage Limits) to turning on Power Saving or using Dark Mode. So if you’re still having power problems after the update (or if you don’t even use Instagram) check out our guides below to keep things ticking along on your Android phone for as long as possible.

    "article_text": "Convenience has come at a cost When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. New research fromNordVPNhas revealed cookies, the small information files generated from web servers and sent to web browsers, are being leaked and exploited on the dark web in huge numbers. The findings calculate there to be around 94 billion cookies circulating on the dark web, with almost 42 billion of these originating from Redline, a notorious infostealer malware - although only 6.2% of these were still active, meaning they have a relatively short lifespan. In fact, most were inactive, with only 7.2% of the 10.5 billion cookies identified from Vidar showing as valid, alongside 6.5% of LummaC2 - a newer infostealer service - which has collected a total of 8.8 billion stolen cookies. There is one outlier though, with CryptBot proving by far the most effective malware given that 83.4% of the 1.4 billion cookies stolen are still active.

This isn’t the first time NordVPN has warned that cookies are being abused, withmillions of stolen UK consumers internet browser cookies leaked on the dark webin 2024, although globally the total for 2024 was 54 billion - outlining an increase year-on-year. These cookies from the dataset contained a range of different information types, with the most common keywords being “ID” (18 billion), alongside “session” (1.2 billion), “Auth” (292 million), and “login” (61 million) - this is particularly worrying, as it suggests that they could be used “hijack live sessions without a password”. The researchers warn; “Cookies may sound sweet, but sometimes they can leave a bad taste. The truth is, even the most seemingly unimportant cookies can do a lot of damage to you or your business. Once one door is open, it isn’t that difficult to open others. Session cookies, especially active ones, are a goldmine. They let attackers skip login pages altogether.” That’s not all though. These cookies could allow attackers to take over social media accounts, bypass two-factor authentication, launch social engineering attacks, or even access sensitive financial information.

    "title": "This worrying Apple Safari security bug could leave users wide open to cyberattacks",
    "article_text": "However Apple doesn't think it's worth addressing When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Fullscreen API, a functionality in theAppleSafaribrowserwhich allows web developers to present specific elements in fullscreen mode, has a vulnerability that is being abused in convincingpasswordtheft attacks, experts have warned. Security researchers SquareX claim to have observed an increase in use in this type of attack, which leverages the browser-in-the-middle (Bitm) technique. Essentially, victims get tricked into interacting with a remote browser that’s under the attackers’ control. Since the browser is in full-screen mode, user interface (UI) and system elements are hidden, making spotting the attack somewhat more difficult. As a result, the victims log into different accounts in a remote browser, thinking they’re doing it on their own device. They still log in, but the process is done on the attacker’s machine, which allows them to harvest login credentials, authentication cookies, and more. “SquareX’s research team has observed multiple instances of the browser’s FullScreen API being exploited to address this flaw by displaying a fullscreen BitM window that covers the parent window’s address bar, as well as a limitation specific to Safari browsers that makes fullscreen BitM attacks especially convincing,” the researchers said in the report. The “limitations specific to Safari browsers” the researchers mentioned are apparently about notifications, since the Apple browser allegedly doesn’t properly alert users when a browser window enters fullscreen mode. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The researchers said that competing browsers, such as Chromium-based ones, or Firefox, show an alert whenever fullscreen is active. While they might still miss the alert, the chances are smaller compared to Safari, where there is no alert. Instead, the only signal is a swipe animation that, as the researchers claim, can easily be missed. \"While the attack works on all browsers, fullscreen BiTM attacks are particularly convincing on Safari browsers due to the lack of clear visual cues when going fullscreen,\" SquareX concluded. The researchers also said they reached out to Apple, who decided not to pursue it further - as apparently, the animation is signal enough.

    "title": "Yes, I surrendered to Bono's immersive Vision Pro documentary, and I didn't get Vertigo",
    "article_text": "A first for Vision Pro and all in the name of love When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Bono has been a ubiquitous presence for most of my adult life. I was just coming up in the world when U2's break-out album,War, arrived, and by 1987's Joshua Tree, Bono and lead guitarist Edge felt inescapable. In other words, I saw U2 frontman Bono as less of an enigma and more of a contemporary. We're both old-ish men now, licking our psychic wounds and (in Bono's case) enigmatically revealing them to the world in, first, 2022'swell-received memoir,Surrender:40 Songs, One Story,and now as an unusual spoken and musical journey,Bono: Stories of Surrender –the first immersive video feature-length film ever released onVision Pro. It's a joyous, funny, sad, sometimes frustrating, and often intense guided tour back through Bono's life and career. Mostly, though, it's a story of Bono (Paul Hewson) and \"Da\" his deeply Irish dad, Bob Hewson. Appleprovided me with a preview of the film, which I viewed almost entirely through Apple's $3,499 mixed-reality headset. There were, because of the way Apple insisted I access the video, some tech glitches (occasional freezing), but it was generally an immersive and often moving experience. Shot almost entirely in stark black and white, the film is both a one-man oratory and an occasional musical performance. Director Andrew Dominik uses the Vision Pro's expansive, almost 360-degree canvas to literally paint scenes around Bono as the singer tells particularly Irish tales about, for instance, his mother dying suddenly when he was just 14, and his father never speaking his wife's name again. The stage is spare, featuring little more than a few chairs, a table, and a fake pint of Guinness. But Dominik uses the Vision Pro's native 3D immersive capabilities to embellish the stage and imagery. Using 3D line drawing, Bono is, even as he performs or talks in front of a live audience, surrounded at points by lyrics, hand-drawn audience members, or boxes and papers that seem to reach to the sky above you. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. This is not a concert or a U2 performance. Early on, Bono admits that it's \"almost transgressive,' to be on stage without his bandmates. Instead, Bono is backed by the Jacknife Lee ensemble, which features an electronic drum kit and a harpsichordist/backup singer. That doesn't sound like a lot, but it works. In fact, Bono, now 65, is in fine voice, which is clear, loud, and agile. This becomes less surprising when you learn that his father was a gifted tenor. Late in the film, Bono does some of his own operatic singing, clearly an homage to his late father. There are some musical performances and even a few moments in the Vision Pro experience where you feel as if you're nose-to-nose with the iconic lead singer (it's unnerving), but most of the singing is done in support of the stories, or rather, the stories explain the origins of songs likePride,With or Without You, andSunday, Bloody Sunday. There's a decent amount of humor, especially a story aboutLuciano Pavarotti, but more importantly, you do get the origin story of Bono's musical interests and the formation of the band, which coincided with meeting his wife of more than 40 years, Ali Hewson. The documentary does start off a little slowly and perhaps melodramatically, with Bono's 2016 heart surgery, and while I am deeply grateful Bono survived, I worried that the whole roughly 90-minute doc might be a bit of a slog. Fortunately, that harrowing tale was just the preamble, and soon, Bono was weaving an entertaining tale of hubris, struggles, and epiphanies. It was, though, frustrating to hear the story behindI Will Followand not get a full performance of the song. I'll admit that I wanted more of U2's discography, though Bono's fresh interpretations, like the almost a cappellaSunday, Bloody Sunday,were stunning. In the end, thisBono: Stories of Surrendergoes too fast, and it ends just as you feel you were finally getting to know the real Bono, a short singer with big tales and, I think, an even bigger heart. He's still not an enigma, but for the first time in 40 years, I feel as if I might just want to hang out with him. As for the Vision Pro, it did a brilliant job. 90 minutes is a long time to wear the mixed reality headset (it was down to 10% battery by the end), so make sure you have a comfortable fit. Mine is good (I use the dual-loop band), though I did take a few breaks. You can watchBono: Stories of Surrenderstarting today on either the Vision Pro (for the special immersive experience) or on Apple TV+, where I suspect you'll enjoy it just as much.

    "article_text": "A doughnut hole in a doughnut hole? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Netflixsleuths appear to have unraveled the mystery ofKnives Out 3's release date ahead of its likely reveal at Netflix Tudum 2025. This year's edition of Netflix's annual fan celebration, which will take place on Saturday, May 31 – in the US, anyway – is set to unveil plenty about numerousnew Netflix moviesand the forthcoming seasons of some of thebest Netflix shows. FromStranger Thingsseason 5toWednesdayseason 2, there'll be a truck-load of release date announcements, trailer reveals, and more to pore over very soon. Knives Out 3– or, to give it its full title,Wake Up, Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery– is also part of this year's line-up. Indeed, whenTudum 2025's date and slate were announcedin April, the thirdKnives Outfilm was among the projects confirmed to appear. It won't be making up the numbers at Tudum 2025, either. After months of radio silence, the Knives Out X/Twitter account has not only *ahem* come back to life, but also heavily implied that a trailer and release date announcement are imminent. \"The wicked desire the stronghold of evildoers, but the root of the righteous endures.\" pic.twitter.com/EYTtLlcYUXMay 28, 2025 Two days ago (May 28), a spooky new teaser, which you can view above, was uploaded to said social media account. The footage, which simply shows a camera panning up to look at a church while its bells ring, doesn't give much away. However, the accompanying caption, which reads \"The wicked desire the stronghold of evildoers, but the root of the righteous endures\", does. Before I explain the significance behind that, though, another sinister teaser, which you can watch below, was posted on the same account yesterday (May 29). This time, the camera slowly crawls through a graveyard and comes equipped with the caption \"The devil has gone down to you! He is filled with fury, because he knows that his time is short\".

He is filled with fury, because he knows that his time is short.\" pic.twitter.com/WyrQJJuCHyMay 29, 2025 Alright, what has this duo got to do withKnives Out 3's possible release date? On theKnives Out Movie Subreddit, detectives have noticed that these captions are actually passages from the Bible. The first is taken from the Book of Proverbs, while the second is directly lifted from the Book of Revelation. That's not all. As Reddit user Avalon3071 points out, these sentences are taken from specific chapters and verses in their respective tomes. On both occasions, it's 12:12. You don't need to be a sleuth on the level of Sherlock Holmes, Hercule Poirot, Miss Marple, or Benoit Blanc to deduceWake Up, Dead Man's likely launch date from that. But, if you're really struggling to work it out, let me spell it out for you: People thinkKnives Out 3will make its debut on the world'sbest streaming serviceon December 12, 2025. Of course, all of this could be a mere coincidence but, if we've learned anything about teasers of this ilk, there's always a secret hidden within. ConsideringGlass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, aka the series' second installment, made its Netflix debut in December 2023, the streaming titan could look to replicate the success it had with that festive hit with the franchise's third entry. In short: don't be surprised ifWake Up, Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery's release date is confirmed to be December 12 at Tudum 2025.

That email would carry a link to the invoice which, when hovered (or clicked) would point to script[.]google[.]com. That way, the criminals would create a false sense of legitimacy with the victims who might think the invoice was actually coming from Google or a Google-affiliated service. Clicking on the link opens a small landing page stating “you have one pending download available” and a “preview” button. # The button leads to the actual malicious page, which mimics the Microsoft 365 login page, almost to the last detail. Those who don’t spot the trick and try to log in, end up relaying their login credentials straight to the attackers. To better hide their tracks, the crooks set up the page so that it redirects back to the actual Microsoft 365 site, as soon as the login credentials are provided.

    "title": "Bridging the AI skills gap: the role of businesses, academia, and mainstream education",
    "article_text": "How to overcome the AI skills gap When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The UK is experiencing anAIboom, fueled by the government’s AI Opportunities Action Plan, and over £14 billion in private investment. This surge in funding is accelerating AI adoption across industries, driving innovation, boostingproductivity, and creating significant job opportunities. Fueling innovation, and economic growth, AI is transforming industries, driving productivity and creating a number of job opportunities. However, while businesses are racing to adopt and implement AI, the workforce skillset is struggling to keep pace. AI skills now account for 40% of the UK’s most pressing tech talent shortages, making it one of the largest gaps in the sector. This highlights a growing challenge: education and training programs simply aren’t evolving fast enough to meet the demands of an AI-driven economy. CTO for Kyndryl United Kingdom and Ireland. Traditional education systems cannot keep pace with AI's rapid evolution. Waiting for universities to modernize their AI curricula is not a viable strategy forbusinesses. Instead, companies must take proactive steps to upskill their workforce, ensuring they have the necessary AI expertise to remain competitive. Some organizations are already progressing in this direction, establishing in-house AI training programs, ranging from foundational AI literacycoursesto specialized technical training for employees in data science, machine learning, and AI applications. These programs can be delivered through online modules, workshops, and mentorship. Businesses should also collaborate with AI education platforms, boot camps, and certification programs to offer employees structuredlearningopportunities. Industry-recognized certifications can help workers gain relevant, up-to-date skills that align with real-world applications. Encouraging AI-skilled employees to mentor colleagues can accelerate knowledge transfer. Taking mentorship one step further, organizations can create AI centers of excellence, where experts guide teams on AI best practices, ethical considerations, and emerging trends. Offering incentives such as financial support for AI-related courses, internal recognition, and career progression opportunities can motivate employees to upskill. Embedding AI expertise into performance evaluations can also reinforce its strategic importance. By investing in AI upskilling today, businesses can bridge the talent gap, drive innovation, and future-proof their workforce. The disconnect between higher education and industry needs is a persistent issue in the AI skills debate. Universities and technical colleges often struggle to keep up with the rapid pace of AI advancements, meaning graduates enter the workforce with outdated skills or theoretical knowledge that lacks real-world applicability. Businesses have a responsibility to actively engage with universities and technical colleges to help shape educational programs. By integrating real-world AIapplications, case studies, and industry projects into coursework, students can develop job-ready skills. But collaboration must go beyond one-off partnerships. Establishing long-term advisory relationships between businesses and academia can ensure that curricula evolve alongside technological advancements. Beyond this, businesses can work with academic institutions to develop AI certification programs that validate students’ expertise in key areas such as machine learning, natural language processing, and AI ethics. These certifications should be recognized across industries to standardize AI proficiency levels and extend beyond the classroom into the workplace. Practical, hands-on experience is also essential. Companies should provide structured mentorship and opportunities for students to work on real-world AI challenges. Offering experience through internships, apprenticeships, and AI research collaborations ensures students gain practical exposure. I would add that it’s not just about training individuals. The UK’s AI adoption efforts are also hindered by outdated IT infrastructure, making it harder for organizations to implement AI effectively. Without a modernized digital ecosystem, even a well-trained workforce will struggle to deploy AI solutions at scale. Businesses and academia must work together not only to prepare the next generation of AI talent but also to modernize digital infrastructures so that organizations can scale AI solutions efficiently. AI is no longer just for data scientists. How can we integrate AI fundamentals into both higher education and professional development programs? AI’s impact is broad and far-reaching, spanning a huge swathe of industries, job roles, and everyday decision-making. To capitalize on AI’s impact, we must ensure AI knowledge and proficiency become mainstream and integrate AI fundamentals into both higher education and professional development programs. AI education should start early, with foundational courses integrated into university and college curricula across disciplines. Business, healthcare,finance, and law students, for example, should be equipped with AI knowledge relevant to their fields. Many professionals interact with AI-driven tools but lack a deep understanding of how they work. Companies should offer AI literacy programs tailored to non-technical employees, covering topics such as responsible AI use, bias mitigation, and automation. Governments, businesses, and educational institutions ideally collaborate to promote AI literacy at a societal level. This can include free AI learning resources, workshops, and public discussions on AI’s ethical and economic implications. AI education should be accessible and flexible. Short, modular AI courses delivered through online platforms can help professionals upskill at their own pace without committing to full-time study. Crucially, AI literacy isn’t just about ensuring businesses see returns on AI investments, it’s about empowering individuals to participate in an AI-driven economy. Without widespread AI knowledge, the risk is that AI remains an exclusive tool wielded by a few, rather than a democratized force that benefits society as a whole. The AI skills gap is a multi-faceted challenge requiring a coordinated response from businesses, academia, and education systems. Businesses must take responsibility for upskilling their workforce, while academic institutions must adapt curriculums to align with industry needs. At the same time, AI literacy must become a mainstream priority, ensuring workers across all sectors are equipped for an AI-powered future. If these gaps are not addressed, the UK risks stagnating in its AI ambitions, with organizations struggling to implement AI effectively and workers left behind in the digital transformation. If businesses, educators, and policymakers act now, they have the opportunity to create a more inclusive, AI-ready workforce that drives sustainable innovation and economic growth. Only through a collaborative, proactive approach can the UK ensure that AI’s benefits are widely distributed rather than concentrated in a select few industries or regions.

    "title": "5 ridiculous myths that businesses hold on Agentic AI",
    "article_text": "How to maximize Agentic AI benefits When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The pace of digital innovation has never been faster, yet outdated ideas aboutAIpersist across boardrooms. One area that suffers the most from this confusion is Agentic AI. Businesses stand on the brink of a transformative era, but many are still paralyzed by misconceptions. This gap between potential and perception leaves businesses lagging, even when the tools for transformation are within reach. Agentic AI is not just another chapter in the tech story. It represents a fundamental shift. Businesses that see it as merely another tool will miss the extraordinary opportunities it offers for real autonomy, innovation, and growth. Founder of the AI Speakers Agency. In just one year, AI and machine learning has soared to new heights with the emergence of advanced large language models, and domain specificsmall language modelsthat can be deployed both on the cloud and the edge. While this kind of intelligence is the new baseline for what we expect in ourapplications,the future of enterprise AI lies in complex, multi-agent workflows that combine powerful models, intelligent agents and human guided decision-making. This market is moving fast. According to recent Deloitte research, 50% of companies using generative AI will launch agentic AI pilots or proofs of concept by 2027. The AI landscape is in constant transformation, fueled by breakthroughs in AI agents, cutting-edge platforms like Azure AI Foundry, andNVIDIA’s robust infrastructure. As we journey through 2025, these innovations are reshaping technology and revolutionizing business operations and strategies. Here are five myths businesses still cling to about Agentic AI, and why believing them could cost you: Agentic AI isn’t about fine-tuning responses or making marginal improvements. It’s about setting objectives, planning workflows, executing tasks, adapting independently, and continuously optimizing outcomes. Unlike traditional AI models that wait for prompts, agentic systems act with autonomy to achieve dynamic goals. Treating these systems like polishedchatbotsseverely underestimates their strategic value. When implemented correctly, agentic systems can offer a step-change in how businesses manage complexity, decision-making, and scale. Many organizations are already acknowledging the potential and implementing the technology for maximum efficiency. Agentic AI isn't just another tool you plug in and walk away from. It reshapes how work gets done.Businessesthat don’t revisit how decisions are made, how teams collaborate, and how data flows will struggle to unlock any meaningful value. Successful agentic AI deployments begin with a fresh look at business workflows, not just system integrations. This technology doesn’t simply automate tasks. It redefines them, forcing leaders to rethink how work gets done. Agentic AI enhances autonomy but doesn’t eliminate the need for human oversight. Escalation points, governance checks, and decision reviews remain essential. Without smart orchestration and clear accountability, businesses risk decision bottlenecks or poorly aligned actions from their AI systems. It’s not about letting AI take the wheel. It’s about designing smarter systems where humans steer the mission and agents drive the momentum. Success will depend not on trusting AI blindly, but on orchestrating smart human-machinecollaborationat every critical juncture. Many businesses still box Agentic AI into the operations category, useful for support tickets, workflows, and back-office automation. That’s a mistake. Agentic AI is moving into sales, marketing, strategic planning, and product innovation. Its ability to plan, reason, and act independently is increasingly being used to augment revenue-generating andcustomer-facing roles. Leaders who confine it to \"process improvement\" risk overlooking its broader potential to drive competitive advantage, transform customer journeys, and unlock growth. Agentic AI success is a marathon, not a sprint. While some tools offer quick wins, full-scale value takes time. Hidden costs related to integration, orchestration, retraining, and long-term optimization often catch businesses off guard, especially those chasing quick wins. Adoption is accelerating across industries, but true ROI depends on a thoughtful, staged rollout, not just enthusiasm. This means staged deployment, continuous learning, and long-term operational alignment. The payoff is significant, but not instant. Businesses that expect overnight gains without the legwork are setting themselves up to be disappointed. Autonomy:Agentic AI systems can operate independently, making decisions and taking actions without constant human supervision. Adaptability:They can adjust their behavior and strategies in response to changing conditions and new information. Goal-driven behavior:They are designed to achieve specific objectives and can learn and improve their performance over time. Complex problem-solving:Agentic AI systems can tackle multi-step problems and situations that require reasoning and planning. Improved efficiency:By automating tasks and making decisions autonomously, agentic AI can streamline workflows and reduce human error. Scalability:Agentic AI systems can be deployed at scale to handle large volumes of data and complex processes. Collaboration with humans:While autonomous, agentic AI can also work collaboratively with humans, leveraging their expertise and knowledge. We've featured the best AI website builder.

    "title": "Trump comments on Macron wife slap",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has said Emmanuel Macron is“fine”following an incident in which his wife Brigitte appeared to slap her husband aboard their plane. The footage, which quickly went viral, was filmed as the French first couple arrived in Hanoi, Vietnam, on May 25 to begin a Southeast Asia tour. As the aircraft door opened, Macron was seen speaking to someone off-camera. Two arms in red sleeves then reached out and pushed his face, covering his mouth and jaw. He stepped back, smiled, and waved after noticing the cameras. Brigitte, wearing a red jacket, soon appeared beside him. Macron offered his arm, which she declined, and the two walked down the stairs together. Asked on Friday if he had any marital advice for Macron, Trump quipped,“Make sure the door remains closed.” He added,“That was not good,”and said he had spoken to Macron after the incident.“He’s fine, they’re fine,”Trump said. “They’re two really good people I know very well,”he added.“I don’t know what that was all about.” Macron has downplayed the incident, telling reporters the moment was simply the two of them“having fun.” He also addressed two other recent viral clips.“A lot of lunatics are spending their days interpreting all these videos,”he said. One clip, filmed on a train to Ukraine, showed Macron with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. The French president briefly hid a small object, prompting online rumors of drug use, which the Elysee palace called baseless. Another, from the European Political Community summit in Albania two weeks ago, showed Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan gripping Macron’s finger while seated, a gesture some interpreted as a power play. Macron confirmed all three videos were genuine but dismissed the narratives around them. He and Brigitte have been married since 2007. The couple met when he was a student and she was a teacher at his high school in Amiens. She is 24 years older than her husband.",

    "title": "Moscow questions Macron’s commitment to Ukraine peace",
    "article_text": "French President Emmanuel Macron’s statements in support of the Ukraine peace process are not credible, according to Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova. In a Telegram post on Friday, Zakharova cited a recent France Info article about a Ukrainian intelligence unit known as the ‘International Revenge’ tactical group, where foreign fighters, including French nationals, are training for frontline operations. French citizens“were taken aback by a blunt publication”that the country’s soldiers are already“serving the Kiev regime,”Zakharova wrote. According to the report, the unit includes both civilians and military personnel from France. Some told the outlet they had already been deployed to the front. Zakharova pointed to what she described as the unit’s neo-Nazi ideology, saying that its name was no coincidence. “The group’s symbols bear all the hallmarks of neo-Nazi revanchism,”she wrote, citing skull insignias, dark imagery, and the Latin slogan ‘Memento Audere Semper’ (‘Remember to dare always’). The motto is known to have been used by Italian fascist and Mussolini ally Gabriele D’Annunzio in reference to the MAS, or ‘Motoscafo Armato Silurante’ – a class of fast torpedo boats used by the Italian Royal Navy in both World Wars. “These French revanchist neo-fascists are not even hiding,”Zakharova added.“They openly talk about coming from France to fight Russians “without sparing bullets” and say they hope to one day face Russia in battle.” Zakharova said the revelations cast doubt on Macron’s talk of commitment to the peace process. France has provided more than €3.7 billion ($4.1 billion) in military aid to Ukraine since the escalation of the conflict in February 2022, according to the Kiel Institute. Macron has advocated deploying French troops to Ukraine in the event of a peace deal between Kiev and Moscow, arguing that it could help deter Russia. In March, he announced a French-British plan to prepare such a“reassurance force”in the event of a ceasefire. The announcement sparked protests in Paris against what demonstrators called NATO’s militaristic stance. Moscow has repeatedly warned it will not accept any NATO presence in Ukraine, citing the military bloc’s expansion in Europe as a core reason for the conflict. Russian and Ukrainian delegations met in Istanbul on May 16 for their first formal talks since 2022. The meeting led to the largest prisoner exchange to date and an agreement to draft written proposals ahead of the next round of talks, which Russia proposed for June 2.",

    "title": "What is Trump’s game in Syria?",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump’s recent announcement that he intends to lift all sanctions on Syria stands as one of the most unexpected and controversial foreign policy moves Washington has made in the past decade. Declared during Trump’s Middle East tour at the US-Saudi Investment Forum in Riyadh, the decision marks a dramatic shift in America’s approach to the region – one that could reshape the strategic landscape for both allies and adversaries. The sanctions on Syria, first imposed in 1979, were progressively tightened over decades in response to accusations of sponsoring terrorism, human rights abuses, and close ties with Iran. Their full repeal is an unprecedented gesture, especially considering that Syria’s current president, Ahmed Hussein al-Sharaa, was until recently regarded by the US as a senior figure in Al-Qaeda – with a $10 million bounty once placed on his capture. In return, Damascus has made a series of strategic commitments. According to Trump, al-Sharaa has pledged to prevent the resurgence of Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS), bring all jihadist detention camps under state control, and expel all foreign terrorist formations from Syrian soil. This latter promise is particularly significant, as these militant units – many of them composed of fighters from Central Asia – played a pivotal role in the collapse of Bashar Assad’s regime and the rise of the current leadership. Many of these same groups are also responsible for large-scale ethnic purges, including the massacres of Alawites and other religious minorities earlier this year. Thus, Trump’s proposal does more than legitimize al-Sharaa’s regime – it places on it the mantle of a regional stabilizer, albeit one whose legitimacy remains heavily disputed. The decision to lift sanctions cannot be divorced from Washington’s broader economic and strategic interests. That the announcement came in Saudi Arabia is no coincidence – it signals a broader understanding with Riyadh, which is eager to deepen its footprint in post-conflict Syria. From the US perspective, the Syria deal is a building block in a new Middle Eastern architecture – one dominated by pro-Western governments and designed to neutralize Iranian influence. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have long viewed Syria’s reconstruction as an opportunity to entrench themselves politically and economically. US sanctions had previously prevented them from acting overtly, and the lifting of restrictions may now be part of a grander bargain: Riyadh receives a green light to invest in Syria, while Washington secures massive financial commitments. On May 14 – the day of Trump’s announcement – Saudi Arabia signed a $142 billion arms deal with the US and pledged an additional $600 billion in American investments. At first glance, Trump’s move might appear as a betrayal of Israeli interests – an accusation made in several media commentaries. Yet in practice, Israel gains a neighbor that, while unpredictable, is now positioned to suppress Islamist radicals within its borders. This allows it to refocus on countering Iran and Hezbollah without the added distraction of threats emanating from Syria. The lifting of sanctions also aligns with Türkiye’s strategic goals. President Erdogan, just prior to the Trump-al-Sharaa meeting, personally urged the US president to dismantle the sanctions. Türkiye is a key partner of Syria’s new leadership but has been constrained by its own economic crisis. Moreover, the sanctions hindered Ankara’s allies – particularly Qatar – from taking part in Syria’s postwar reconstruction. In sum, Trump’s Syrian deal represents more than just a diplomatic maneuver; it is a bold attempt to reengineer the regional balance of power. Whether it brings long-term stability or fuels new fault lines remains to be seen – but its impact on the Middle East is already unmistakable. The developments unfolding in Syria following the rise to power of Ahmed al-Sharaa increasingly evoke the atmosphere of 2011 – the era of the Arab Spring, when the Middle East fractured into two ideological and geopolitical camps. At the time, Türkiye and Qatar actively championed the cause of ‘political Islam’, seeking to expand their influence through the emergence of Islamist-oriented governments. In contrast, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates perceived Islamist forces as a direct threat to regional stability and the survival of their monarchical order. Today, under al-Sharaa’s leadership, Syria once again reflects that same fault line. A sense of déjà vu looms: The region’s main players find themselves navigating renewed tensions, caught between the desire to preserve influence and the necessity of adapting to a rapidly evolving reality. Ankara and Doha, both instrumental in al-Sharaa’s ascent, view his leadership as an opportunity to reclaim their diminished standing in the Levant. Despite its internal economic turmoil, Türkiye continues to position itself as a regional arbiter, relying on a network of loyal political and military actors within Syria. Qatar, for its part, is providing financial and diplomatic support, effectively replicating the strategy it previously deployed in Libya, Egypt, and Tunisia. Yet the current landscape differs markedly from that of 2011. Al-Sharaa, though buoyed by Turkish support, has signaled a desire for greater autonomy from the outset. His first official foreign visit was not to Ankara, but to Riyadh – a symbolic gesture toward Saudi Arabia and the UAE, whose economic power is now essential for Syria’s reconstruction. It was also a clear signal that Damascus is open to dialogue, even with those who once backed the opposing side in the civil war. For Saudi Arabia and the UAE, the resurgence of politically motivated Islamist forces is a source of deep concern, though their response has remained deliberately muted. Rather than overt confrontation, these Gulf monarchies have opted for economic engagement, believing that financial leverage will grant them influence while curbing radicalization. They also see the new Syrian leadership as a potential partner in shaping a new Middle Eastern order – provided that Damascus does not become an instrument of Turkish expansionism. This explains al-Sharaa’s active display of ‘independent maneuvering’, as he skillfully balances between centers of power – from the Gulf to Ankara, from Washington to Moscow. Amid this geopolitical mosaic, the US has crafted a new strategic vision. Under Trump’s leadership, US policy increasingly focuses on economic leverage and security cooperation while moving away from direct military engagement in the Middle East. Trump proposes a new model: ‘Regional self-sufficiency’ under an American umbrella. The essence of this model is to arm and equip regional actors, enabling them to maintain stability independently, with the US acting as a supplier of advanced technology and a guarantor of balance. In return, Washington demands loyalty, political restraint, and – crucially – substantial financial contributions. This underpins the strategic alignment with Gulf monarchies, who possess the means and motivation to counterbalance Iran. At the same time, Trump is attempting to bridge the divide between Türkiye and Israel, laying the groundwork for an economic partnership despite ideological differences. The goal is to prevent friction among US allies and to forge a unified front against Iran and other hostile forces. Syria, in this context, becomes a testing ground for America’s new security architecture – a controlled regional equilibrium maintained without the Pentagon’s direct footprint. If successful, this model could be replicated in other crisis zones. A potential next step is the normalization of relations between Syria and Israel – a previously unimaginable prospect, now discussed as part of a broader settlement. In parallel, Trump plans to introduce a new Middle East peace framework that includes recognition of Palestine in exchange for diplomatic and economic incentives from Arab states. This scenario may also presage political change in Israel: If Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu resists the plan, centrist alternatives like Yair Lapid or Benny Gantz – more amenable to compromise – could come to the fore. All of this unfolds against the backdrop of a fundamental reordering of US global priorities. Washington is increasingly pivoting toward the containment of China, its primary strategic rival in the 21st century. The Middle East is no longer seen as a vital sphere; the new approach favors balance over expansion, mediation over presence, partnership over intervention. Thus, US regional strategy is evolving from rigid control to a more adaptive configuration – one in which local actors are granted greater autonomy, though still within an overarching framework engineered in Washington. Syria may well serve as the first case study of this new era – an era in which the return to the logic of 2011 unexpectedly becomes the launchpad for a very different Middle East. The US decision to lift sanctions on Syria following the rise of al-Sharaa to power marks a pivotal moment for a country that has endured over a decade of devastating war, international isolation, and socioeconomic collapse. This move not only removes one of the most significant external constraints on the Syrian leadership, but also opens a window of opportunity to construct a new model of governance – one grounded in pragmatism, economic rationality, and cautious multilateralism. Al-Sharaa now faces a critical choice: To use this opportunity to consolidate centralized authority and restore effective governance – or, through missteps or weakness, to allow Syria to fragment further into a collection of ethno-regional entities devoid of a unifying national project. The World Bank has cleared over $15 million of Syrian debt, once again making the country eligible for participation in international financing programs. This development was made possible through targeted financial contributions from the Gulf states – particularly Saudi Arabia and Qatar – signaling their intention to take the lead in Syria’s reconstruction. Following this, the IMF expressed its readiness to provide technical assistance, while the Syrian authorities issued a series of statements inviting investment in agriculture, energy, transportation infrastructure, and tourism. These actions indicate the new regime’s ambition to craft an economic model that not only addresses the war’s legacy but also generates employment, stabilizes the currency, boosts public revenues, and – most importantly – restores public trust in the institution of the state. However, economic recovery is only feasible if accompanied by the genuine restoration of governance. Syria remains deeply fragmented. Kurdish regions in the northeast are governed by a de facto autonomous administration with its own armed forces and international channels. In the south, the Druze community in Suwayda exhibits growing political and organizational independence, alongside protest movements and local defense initiatives. Along the coastal regions – home to significant Alawite and Christian minorities – distrust toward centralized power continues to grow, especially amid persistent ethno-sectarian tensions. These communities, should the center weaken, may gravitate toward political separatism or at least self-organization into autonomous administrative structures. If the al-Sharaa government fails to propose a coherent model of political integration – one that includes power-sharing, resource distribution, and the participation of regional elites in governance – Syria could enter a new phase of ‘soft disintegration’: A de facto federalization where unity is maintained in name only. In this context, foreign policy becomes critically important. Fully aware of the dangers of unilateral alignment, Ahmed al-Sharaa is pursuing a balanced external strategy. Unlike the previous era, which was defined by dependence on a narrow circle of allies, Syria’s new president is embracing a diversified diplomatic approach. He seeks to build relations with the West and the US – especially in the context of economic recovery and Syria’s international rehabilitation – without abandoning existing strategic ties. It is within this framework that Russia remains a key partner to Syria across several strategic domains. Russia continues to play a central role in Syria’s security architecture and diplomatic positioning, including defending Syrian interests at the UN Security Council and engaging in technical, military, and energy cooperation. Its presence in Tartus and Khmeimim, involvement in humanitarian initiatives, and potential contributions to infrastructure reconstruction ensure its continued relevance in any long-term settlement scenario. At the same time, Damascus under al-Sharaa is also looking to build stronger ties with other non-Western power centers – including China, India, and Brazil – while deepening economic engagement with the Arab world. This will help Syria avoid overdependence on any single actor and enhance its strategic flexibility amid global uncertainty. This approach reflects a clear-eyed understanding of Syria’s geopolitical reality: The country can no longer afford to be part of rigid geopolitical axes. Its survival now depends on its ability to navigate between competing powers – leveraging their rivalry for national benefit without becoming anyone’s pawn. Maintaining cooperative relations with Russia and expanding dialogue with non-Western powers is not just a matter of foreign policy – it is a means of preserving autonomy in a context of limited sovereignty. The lifting of sanctions and al-Sharaa’s ascent have opened a potential path toward stabilization. But the durability of this trajectory depends on the regime’s ability not only to harness economic resources but also to execute a complex, multi-layered political and diplomatic agenda. Domestically, this means launching mechanisms of integration and decentralization; externally, it requires deft maneuvering between Western and non-Western actors. In this evolving environment, Russia remains an important partner for Syria – not as an exclusive ally, but as a key component in the multifaceted diplomacy that al-Sharaa will seek to construct in order to reinforce not just his own authority, but the very foundations of the Syrian state.",

    "title": "Trump hesitant to confront Putin over Ukraine – Politico source",
    "article_text": "EU officials are reportedly concerned that US President Donald Trump is reluctant to pressure his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, over the Ukraine conflict, according to Politico. Earlier this week, Trump said Putin is“playing with fire”after Russia launched large-scale strikes on Ukrainian military-related facilities. The attacks came in response to a sharp increase in Kiev’s drone raids targeting civilian areas in Russia. Despite his tough rhetoric, Trump has so far held back from approving what Senator Lindsey Graham called“bone-crushing”sanctions against Moscow. In an article on Thursday, the outlet cited an unnamed EU official who said it is“very clear there is something holding him [Trump] back from actually putting more pressure on Putin.” “He may want the reset with Russia most of all, more than peace. If he just wants to get the war ended so he can do these deals [with Putin], then he may be weighing the cost of poisoning their potential relationship,”the source suggested. Asked on Thursday if he still believes that Putin is interested in finding a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine conflict, Trump said:“I will let you know in about two weeks. We are going to find out whether or not he is tapping us along or not. And if he is, we will respond a little bit differently.” According to White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, Trump is waiting for the outcome of potential talks between delegations from Moscow and Kiev in Istanbul on Monday. On Thursday, Moscow’s envoy to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, reiterated Russia’s readiness to continue“serious direct negotiations”with Kiev in order to find a solution to the Ukraine conflict that addresses the root causes. He warned, however, that if Ukraine“tries to prolong the war… neither new anti-Russian sanctions, nor arms supplies to Ukraine, nor other hostile steps vis-a-vis Russia will be able to prevent the inevitable military defeat of the [Vladimir] Zelensky regime.”",

    "title": "EU state sentences teacher for ‘pro-Russian’ views",
    "article_text": "A Czech court has handed a former teacher a seven-month suspended sentence for expressing pro-Russian views during a school lesson, local media reported on Thursday. Martina Bednarova was also banned from teaching for three years and ordered to complete a media literacy course, according to the Ceska Justice news portal. The court reportedly said Bednarova misused her role by presenting“misleading information”to students. The incident occurred in April 2022, shortly after the escalation of the Ukraine conflict, during a Czech language lesson at an elementary school in Prague. According to media reports, Bednarova described Russia’s military action of Ukraine as a“justified way of resolving the situation”and cast doubt on Czech television’s coverage. She also said“Nazi Ukrainian groups”had been killing Russians since 2014, apparently referring to Ukrainian nationalist battalions such as Azov, which Moscow has accused of committing atrocities against ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine, and which the Kiev authorities dispute. Students recorded the class and alerted school officials, leading to Bednarova’s dismissal. Judge Eliska Matyasova claimed Bednarova was not simply expressing personal views but delivering false information in a classroom where students could not question it. Bednarova said her remarks were part of a media literacy lesson and called the case politically driven. The verdict is not final, as she has the right to appeal. The District Court initially acquitted Bednarova twice, with an appeals chamber backing the second ruling on free speech grounds. In January, however, the Supreme Court overturned the decisions and ordered a new review to assess whether her actions met the criteria for a criminal offense. Prague has taken a strongly anti-Russian stance in recent years, especially in response to the Ukraine conflict, becoming one of Kiev’s staunchest supporters. In its 2023 human rights report, the Russian Foreign Ministry labeled the Czech government’s actions as“Russophobic”and expressed concern over freedom of speech in the country. It also raised concerns over the functioning of media in the Czech Republic and noted what it called a steady drift toward anti-Russian sentiment. Russian will also be phased out as a second language by 2034 under new Czech education reforms, with students limited to German, French or Spanish. As of late 2023, over 40,000 Russian nationals lived in the country, making them the fourth-largest foreign community. The Czech Republic, once part of communist Czechoslovakia and a Soviet-aligned Eastern Bloc member, became independent in 1993 after the 1989 Velvet Revolution and the Soviet Union’s collapse. Since then, the country has removed or altered hundreds of Soviet-era monuments, with another wave of removals following the 2014 Western-backed coup in Kiev and the escalation of the Ukraine conflict.",

    "title": "Veto ban would mean the end of EU – Fico",
    "article_text": "A reported EU plan to scrap member states’ veto power on matters of foreign policy would spell the end of the bloc and could become“the precursor of a huge military conflict,”Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has warned. Slovakia and its Central European neighbour Hungary have long opposed the EU’s approach to the Ukraine conflict, criticizing military aid to Kiev and sanctions on Russia. Both governments have repeatedly threatened to use their veto powers to block EU actions they view as harmful to national interests. To bypass dissent, Brussels is reportedly weighing a shift from unanimous voting, a founding principle of EU foreign policy, to qualified majority voting (QMV), arguing that it would streamline decision-making and prevent individual states from paralyzing joint actions. Fico, however, condemned the proposal on Thursday during the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Hungary. “The imposition of a mandatory political opinion, the abolition of the veto, the punishment of the sovereign and the brave, the new Iron Curtain, the preference for war over peace. This is the end of the common European project. This is a departure from democracy. This is the precursor of a huge military conflict,”he said. EU sanctions on Russia currently require unanimous renewal every six months, with the current term set to expire at the end of July. Brussels is also preparing an 18th package of sanctions aimed at tightening restrictions on Russia’s energy sector and financial institutions. Earlier this month, during a visit to Moscow for Victory Day commemorations, Fico assured Russian President Vladimir Putin that Slovakia would veto any EU-wide attempt to ban imports of Russian oil or gas. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has taken a similar stance. While Hungary has not formally blocked a sanctions package, it has delayed several rounds to extract concessions. Orban has also warned that removing the veto would strip smaller nations of their sovereignty. “We want Brussels to show us, as all other member countries, the same respect, not only symbolically, but also by taking our interests into account,”he said last month. Both Slovakia and Hungary have resisted increased military support to Kiev, with Budapest blocking several key decisions citing concerns over national interests and the potential for escalation. Fico has emphasized the need for peace negotiations over continued military engagement.",

    "title": "Elite Western universities form a corrupt and parasitic empire",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has banned international students from attending Harvard University, citing national security concerns. The move has sparked widespread condemnation from academics and foreign governments, who warn it could damage America’s global influence and reputation for academic openness. At stake is not just Harvard’s global appeal, but the very premise of open academic exchange that has long defined elite higher education in the US. But exactly how ‘open’ is Harvard’s admissions process? Every year,highly qualified students– many with top-tier SAT or GMAT test scores – are rejected, often with little explanation. Critics argue that behind the prestigious Ivy League brand lies an opaque system shaped by legacy preferences, DEI imperatives, geopolitical interests, andoutright bribes. George Soros, for instance, once pledged$1 billionto open up elite university admissions to drones who would read from his Open Society script. China’s swift condemnation of Trump’s policy added a layer of geopolitical irony to the debate. Why would Beijing feign concern for“America’s international standing”amid a bitter trade war? The international standing of US universities has long been tarnished by a woke psychosis whichspread like cancerto all branches of the government. So, what was behind China’s latest gripe? The answer may lie in the unspoken rules of soft power: Ivy League campuses are battlegrounds for influence. The US deep state has long recruited foreign students to promote its interests abroad – subsidized by American taxpayers no less. China is apparently playing the same game, leveraging elite US universities to co-opt future leaders on its side of the geostrategic fence. For the time being, a judge has granted Harvard’s request for atemporary restraining orderagainst Trump’s proposed ban. Come what may, there is one commonsense solution that all parties to this saga would like to avoid: Forcing Ivy League institutions to open their admissions process to public scrutiny. The same institutions that champion open borders, open societies, and open everything will, however, not tolerate any suggestion of greater openness to its admissions process. That would open up a Pandora’s Box of global corruption that is systemically ruining nations today. Speaking of corruption – how is this for irony? Astar Harvard professorwho built her career researching decision-making and dishonesty was just fired and stripped of tenure for fabricating her own data! The Ivy League has a vested interest in perpetuating rising wealth and educational inequalities. It is the only way they can remain atop the global rankings list at the expense of less-endowed peers. Elite universities like Harvard, Stanford, and MITdominatelists of institutions with the most ultra-wealthy alumni (net worth over $30mn). For example, Harvard alone has 18,000 ultra-high-net-worth (UHNW) alumni, representing 4% of the global UHNW population. These alumni networks provide major donations, corporate partnerships, and exclusive opportunities, reinforcing institutional wealth. If the alma mater’s admissions process was rigged in their favor, they have no choice but to cough it up, at least for the sake of their offspring who will perpetuate this exclusivist cycle. The total endowment ofPrinceton University– $34.1 billion in 2024 – translated to $3.71 million per student, enabling generous financial aid and state-of-the-art facilities. Less prestigious institutions just cannot compete on this scale. Global university rankings (QS, THE, etc.) heavily favor institutions with large endowments, high spending per student, and wealthy student bodies. For example, 70% of the top 50 US News & World Report Best Colleges overlap with universities boasting the largest endowments and the highest percentage of students from the top1% of wealthy families. According to theSocial Mobility Index(SMI), climbing rankings requires tens of millions in annual spending, driving tuition hikes and exacerbating inequality. Lower-ranked schools which prioritize affordability and access are oftenovershadowed in traditional rankings, which reward wealth over social impact. Besides, social mobility these days is predetermined at birth, as the global wealth divide becomes unbridgeable. Worse, the global ranking system itself thrives on graft, with institutions gaming audits, inflating data, and even bribing reviewers. Take the case of a Southeast Asian diploma mill where some of its initial batch of female students had been arrested for prostitution. Despite its flagrant lack of academic integrity, it grew rapidly to secure an unusually high QS global ranking – ahead of venerable institutions like the University of Pavia, where Leonardo da Vinci studied, and which boasts three Nobel Laureates among its ranks. Does this grotesque inversion of merit make any sense? Government policies increasingly favor elite institutions. Recent White House tax cuts and deregulation may further widen gaps by benefiting corporate-aligned universities whilereducing public fundingfor others. This move was generally welcomed by the Ivy League until Trump took on Harvard. With such ominous trends on the horizon, brace yourselves for an implosion of the global education sector by 2030 – a reckoning mirroring the 2008 financial crisis, but with far graver consequences. And touching on the 2008 crisis, didn’t someone remark that“behind every financial disaster, there’s a Harvard economist?” Nobody seems to be learning from previous contretemps. In fact, I dare say that ‘learning’ is merely a coincidental output of the Ivy League brand When Lehman Brothers and its lesser peers collapsed in 2008, many Singapore-based corporations eagerly scooped up theirlaid-off executives. The logic? Fail upward. If these whizz kids were truly talented, why did they miss the glaring warning signs during the lead up to the greatest economic meltdown since the Great Depression? The answer lies in the cult of credentialism and an entrenched patronage system. Ivy League MBAs and Rolodexes of central banker contacts are all that matters. The consequences are simply disastrous: A runaway global talent shortage will hit$8.452 trillionin unrealized annual revenues by 2030, more than the projectedGDP of Indiafor the same year. Ivy League MBAs often justify their relevance by overcomplicating simple objectives into tedious bureaucratic grinds – all in the name of efficiency, smart systems, and ever-evolving ‘best practices’. The result? Doctors now spend more time on paperwork than treating patients, while teachers are buried under layers of administrative work. Ultimately, Ivy League technocrats often function as a vast bureaucratic parasite, siphoning public and private wealth into elite hands. What kind of universal socioeconomic model are these institutions bequeathing to the world? I can only think of one historical analogue as a future cue: Colonial India, aka the British Raj. This may be a stretch, but bear with me. Lessons from the Raj AsNorman Daviespointed out, the Austro-Hungarians had more bureaucrats managing Prague than the British needed to run all of colonial India – a subcontinent that included modern-day Pakistan and Bangladesh. In fact, it took only 1,500-odd white Indian Civil Service (ICS) officials to govern colonial India until WWI. That is quite staggering to comprehend, unless one grasps how the British and Indian societies are organized along rigid class (and caste) lines. When two corrupt feudal systems mate, their offspring becomes a blueprint for dystopia. India never recovered from this neo-feudal arrangement. If the reader thinks I am exaggerating, let’s compare the conditions in the British Raj and China from 1850 to 1976 (when the Cultural Revolution officially ended). During this period, China endured numerous societal setbacks – including rebellions, famines, epidemics, lawlessness, and a world war – which collectively resulted in the deaths of nearly 150 million Chinese. The Taiping Rebellion alone – the most destructive civil war in history – resulted in 20 to 30 million dead, representing 5-10% of China’s population at the time. A broad comparison with India during the same period reveals a death toll of 50-70 million, mainly from epidemics and famines. Furthermore, unlike colonial India, many parts of China also lacked central governance. Indian nationalists are quick to blame a variety of bogeymen for their society’s lingering failings. Nevertheless, they should ask themselves why US Big Tech-owned news platforms, led by upper-caste Hindu CEOs, no less, showed a decidedly pro-Islamabad bias during the recent Indo-Pakistanimilitary standoff. Maybe, these CEOs are supine apparatchiks, much like their predecessors during the British Raj? Have they been good stewards of the public domain (i.e. internet)? Have they promoted meritocracy in foreign lands? (You can read some stark exampleshere,hereandhere). These Indian Big Tech bros, however, showed a lot of vigor and initiative during the Covid-19 pandemic, forcing their employees to take the vaccine or face the pink slip. They led the charge behind the Global Task Force on Pandemic Response, which included an“unprecedented corporate sector initiative to help India successfully fight COVID-19.”Just check out thecredentialsof the ‘experts’ involved here. Shouldn’t this task be left to accomplished Indian virologists and medical experts? A tiny few, in the service of a hegemon, can control the fate of billions.India’s income inequalityis now worse than it was under British rule. As global university inequalities widen further, it is perhaps time to rethink novel approaches to level the education field as many brick and mortar institutions may simply fold during thevolatile 2025-30 period. I am optimistic that the use ofAI in educationwill be a great equalizer, but I also fear that Big Tech will force governments into using its proprietary EdTech solutions that are already showing signs of runawayAI hallucinations– simply because the bold new world is all about control and power, not empowerment. Much like the British Raj, I would say.",

    "title": "Russian security chief reacts to German missile claims",
    "article_text": "Moscow has the means to respond to Berlin’s decision to lift the range restrictions on Ukrainian strikes with missiles provided by Germany, Russian Security Council Secretary Sergey Shoigu has said. Earlier this week, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz claimed that“there are no longer any range restrictions on weapons supplied to Ukraine, neither from the British nor the French, nor from us, nor from the Americans.” In a separate interview on Wednesday, Merz said deliveries of German Taurus missiles – which have a range of 500km and could potentially reach Moscow – to Kiev is“in the realm of possible.” Speaking at a conference on Thursday, Shoigu highlighted the inconsistency of Ukraine’s Western backers regarding the use of long-range weapons. The administration of former US President Joe Biden lifted the restrictions on long-range attacks last November, with the UK and France following suit shortly afterwards. Since then, the Russian military has repelled a number of strikes against its territory, which included US-supplied ATACMS and British Storm Shadow missiles. Former German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was reluctant to approve deep strikes into Russia or to supply Ukraine with Taurus missiles over fears of escalation. “There are many statements. They are all different. First, they say that they had lifted it, then they say that they did not. Then they say that they did it long ago… So, did you lift it or not?”Shoigu said, adding:“we can also lift limitations on some things. I will not expand on this, but we have our own restrictions that we can remove in response.” The chancellor, who welcomed Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky in Berlin on Wednesday, also said Germany will help Kiev with the production of long-range weaponry inside Ukraine. According to the German Defense Ministry, a large part of the country’s newly announced €5.2 billion ($5.6 billion) military aid for Ukraine will be allocated for the project. High-ranking Russian diplomat Rodion Miroshnik stressed on Friday that any weapons production facilities in Ukraine are legitimate targets for the Russian military, and are subject to“unequivocal destruction.” Miroshnik, the Russian Foreign Ministry’s ambassador-at-large tasked with documenting Kiev’s alleged war crimes, also said Berlin’s recent moves show that they“are not looking for peace, [but are] trying in every possible way to continue the Ukraine conflict, to continue the bloodshed”in order to distract the people from the problems in their own country.",

    "article_text": "US authorities are investigating an individual who has allegedly been impersonating White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. The impersonator has been attempting to deceive prominent Republican senators, governors and business leaders over the past several weeks, by pretending to be Wiles, sources familiar with the investigation have told the newspaper. The individual has reportedly used text messages and phone calls using a voice likely generated by AI. Some of the targets interacted with the imposter, but others found the messages immediately suspicious as they contained grammatical errors and used an overly formal tone that did not align with Wiles’ style. Some recipients were asked questions Wiles would be expected to know, and in at least one case, the caller solicited a money transfer. Sources told the WSJ that Wiles suspects her personal phone may have been hacked and her contact list compromised, but investigators have yet to confirm that theory. The FBI does not believe a foreign government is behind the scheme, according to the report. While Wiles’ contacts have been notified, fraudulent messages were sent as recently as this week, including while she was accompanying Trump on a trip to the Middle East, sources told the outlet. In May, then-national security adviser Mike Waltz became embroiled in a separate communications mishap after mistakenly adding a senior editor with The Atlantic to a private Signal group chat. Trump later stated that Waltz had“learned a lesson,”though media reports claimed that internal pressure mounted for his removal. His resignation wasannouncedearlier this month.",

    "title": "Trump’s trade war has cost firms $34 billion – Reuters",
    "article_text": "Multi-national companies have suffered $34 billion in losses due to tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump, according to a Reuters analysis. The measures have disrupted businesses and heightened tensions with Washington's key allies, notably the EU. The report, based on disclosures from 56 firms across the US, Europe, and Japan, attributes the losses to higher input costs, revenue losses, and supply chain uncertainty. Economists have warned the real cost could be far higher, owing to ripple effects including weaker investment, reduced consumer spending, and rising inflation risks. Trump has rolled out sweeping duties since returning to office in January, in the name of protecting US manufacturing which culminated in his“Liberation Day”tariffs on April 2 that included a universal 10% levy on all imports and a threatened 50% rate on EU goods. “The Administration has consistently maintained that the United States, as the world’s largest economy, has the leverage to make our trading partners ultimately bear the cost of tariffs,”said White House spokesperson Kush Desai. However, data suggests American businesses are footing the bill, while relations with Washington’s allies have grown increasingly strained. The EU prepared countermeasures targeting €100 billion worth of American goods, including cars, medical devices, and plastics. After a call between Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the 50% duties were delayed until July 9 to allow room for negotiation. Apple, Ford, Kimberly-Clark, Walmart, and others have warned of rising costs and lowered their own forecasts, blaming Trump’s“erratic”trade approach, Reuters reported. One of the few to endorse the measures is General Motors, which has backed the auto tariffs, arguing they allow US automakers to compete more fairly. Trump has defended his tariff strategy as a way of reshoring jobs and reducing the trade deficit.“We’re going to raise hundreds of billions in tariffs; we’re going to become so rich we’re not going to know where to spend that money,”he said in March. According to the Tax Foundation, tariffs imposed and scheduled for 2025 are projected to raise $152.7 billion in federal revenue, equivalent to 0.49% of GDP, the largest tax increase since 1993.",

    "title": "Importing crime: Angela Merkel started the EU’s migrant crisis, and she wants it to continue",
    "article_text": "The former chancellor is back in the news, lecturing her fellow citizens to allow more asylum seekers into their country even as Germany is plagued by rampant crime and dismal economic factors. If it is true that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again but expecting different results, then we can say with some degree of certainty that Angela Merkel is suffering severely on the mental front. The four-term leader of the Christian Democratic Union (2005-2021) has gone down in the history books as the person most responsible for the greatest upheaval of German society in modern times, and she shows no sign of letting up. Without ever asking the German electorate what they wanted, Merkel in 2015 opened her country’s borders to over one million illegal immigrants, while holding out cash incentives and other handsome benefits for those who made the difficult journey. Merkel was of the opinion that Germany had the economic strength to handle the influx of migrants and reiterated that there was no legal maximum limit on the number of migrants the country could take. Unfortunately, she was seriously mistaken. And her views on the matter – despite serious cultural, societal and political repercussions – have not changed. During this week’s presentation of her memoir, ‘Freedom,’ Merkel, 70,spoke outon migration, warning that without it“we could see Europe destroyed.” “I do not believe we can decisively combat illegal migration at the German-Austrian or German-Polish border… I have always advocated European solutions,”Merkel said when asked about the latest measures adopted by Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who faces an uphill battle in the Bundestag, the federal parliament, to incorporate more anti-immigration policies. As for Merkel the diehard globalist, who oncelamentedthe failure of multiculturalism, she fails to understand that the German people are desperately holding out hope for a real change of political course. The fact is Germany is no longer a safe place to do simple everyday things, like take a casual stroll down the street or to raise a family, without an unhealthy degree of fear and apprehension. That is because an entirely new phenomenon of knife attacks is now plaguing the streets of every German city as the migration crisis has spiraled into a crime crisis. Statisticsshowthat such heinous criminal acts, overwhelmingly committed by individuals of foreign origin, are getting worse, with a shocking 79 knife attacks per day on average now recorded, according to some German media. Last year, there were 29,014 cases involving a crime where a knife was used, of which, 15,741 were knife attacks. Physical harm involving a knife surged by 10.8 percent in 2024 compared to 2023. Here is just a glimpse of the recent violence that has plagued Germany. In January, a two-year-old boy and a 41-year-old man were killed in astabbing in a parkin Aschaffenburg, with several others wounded. One month later, a Spanish tourist wasstabbedat Berlin’s Holocaust Memorial. This month, a 35-year-old Syrian asylum seekerstabbedfive youths in an unprovoked knife attack outside a popular student bar in Bielefeld, Germany. Not all of the migrant violence was the result of a knife attack. Last December, six people were killed and hundreds were injured after a carplowed into a crowd at a Christmas marketin the eastern city of Magdeburg. Such indiscriminate attacks must be taking a heavy toll on the German psyche. Meanwhile, otherstatisticsreveal the state of mind of the average German voter and the real consequences of Merkel’s reckless policies. Die Welt has reported, citing a new survey by YouGov, that 31% of those surveyed said they would“definitely”move abroad if they were entirely free to choose. Another 27% of respondents said they would“probably”leave. Within this group, 61% identified the country’s immigrant situation as a major factor influencing their decision, while 41% cited Germany’s ongoing economic recession. Speaking of the economy, Merkel’s continual promotion of open borders is coming at a time when Germany has been enduring its longest phase of economic stagnation in post-war history. The country’s struggling economy shrank for a second year in a row in 2024, as gross domestic product (GDP) declined by 0.2% compared to the previous year. Germany’s central bank, the Bundesbank, has lowered its forecast for the economy and only expects very modest growth of 0.2% for 2025. In other words, it may be simply asking too much of the German people to continue supporting asylum seekers at a time when so many are feeling the sting of economic uncertainty. For many Germans, their only hope is for a major change in the political landscape. Thus, many citizens have thrown their support behind the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), the biggest opposition party, which came in second in the February general election with just over 20% of the vote. That was the best national result for a hard-right party in Germany since the Second World War, and despite being designated as an“extremist”organization by Germany’s domestic intelligence service. US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, described the ruling as“tyranny in disguise”. Posting on social media, Rubio said:“What is truly extremist is not the popular AfD – which took second in the recent election – but rather the establishment’s deadly open border immigration policies.” Angela Merkel would do well to heed the opinion of the average German voter, who seems to be running out of patience, and support a pause in the influx of asylum seekers at this dangerous juncture.",

Nathan Vilas Laatsch, 28, of Alexandria, Virginia, was charged on Thursday with trying to share classified information with someone he believed represented a foreign government. He was detained following an FBI sting operation. Laatsch, who has worked as an IT specialist in the DIA’s Insider Threat Division since 2019, allegedly expressed intent to share classified materials due to ideological differences with the Trump administration. “The recent actions of the current administration are extremely disturbing to me,”he said in an email reportedly intercepted by the FBI.“I do not agree or align with the values of this administration and intend to act to support the values that the United States at one time stood for.” The DOJ said the FBI had initiated an investigation in March after receiving a tip about Laatsch’s intentions. Undercover agents, posing as representatives of a foreign government, communicated with Laatsch, who began transcribing classified information onto a notepad at his desk over a three-day period. He then allegedly concealed the notes in his socks and lunchbox to remove them from the facility. On May 1, Laatsch reportedly left a thumb drive containing documents marked ‘Secret’ and ‘Top Secret’ at a prearranged drop-off location in a public park in northern Virginia. He later expressed interest in obtaining citizenship from the foreign country, stating he did not expect“things here to improve in the long term,”the prosecutors said. Laatsch was arrested at a subsequent drop-off location on Thursday. He is scheduled to appear in court in Alexandria. The identity of the foreign government involved has not been disclosed, but the DOJ described it as a US ally. “This case underscores the persistent risk of insider threats,”FBI Director Kash Patel wrote on X on Friday.“The FBI remains steadfast in protecting our national security and thanks our law enforcement partners for their critical support.” The arrest of Laatsch adds to a series of high-profile cases involving US intelligence personnel leaking classified information. In August last year, Pentagon employee Gokhan Gun was arrested while trying to travel to Mexico with ‘Top Secret’ documents. Gun, 50, was charged with unauthorized retention of classified materials. In 2023, Air National Guardsman Jack Teixeira, 21, was sentenced to 15 years in prison after pleading guilty to leaking hundreds of classified Pentagon documents on Discord. The files included intelligence on the Ukraine conflict and other sensitive matters.",

    "title": "Ukraine trying to trick Trump – Moscow",
    "article_text": "Ukraine is trying to trick US President Donald Trump, who wants to achieve peace in the ongoing conflict, into returning Washington to an anti-Russian stance, Vassily Nebenzia, Moscow’s envoy to the UN, has said. During his speech at a UN Security Council briefing on Ukraine on Thursday, Ambassador Nebenzia reminded of the intensification of Ukrainian drone incursions into Russia over the past week. A total of 1,465 drones had been shot down by air defenses, but nonetheless led to civilian casualties and deaths, including among children, he said. Kiev and its NATO backers“are trying to make us believe that Russia is deliberately shelling residential areas of Ukrainian cities”during its retaliatory strikes, the envoy stressed. Moscow’s attacks“target exclusively objects related to Ukraine’s military-industrial complex, and we are successfully destroying them or rendering them inoperable,”Nebenzia said, reiterating the stance consistency voiced by the Russian Defense Ministry throughout the conflict. “The plans concocted by [Vladimir] Zelensky and his posse are way too plain and clear. Their task is to trick and mislead American President Donald Trump, who is taking decisive steps toward peace; they are ready to go to any lengths only to return the US – which has already wasted hundreds of billions of dollars helping Ukraine – to an anti-Russian and Russophobic course,”he insisted. However, the envoy stressed that“promoting Ukrainian and Western lies about Russia is becoming increasingly difficult, since the actual steps of the Kiev regime, its deliberate choice in favor of war and the further suffering of its citizens speak volumes.” Moscow is eager to continue“serious direct negotiations”with Kiev in order to find a solution to the Ukraine conflict that would address its root causes, he said. He reminded that Russia has invited the Ukrainian delegation to Istanbul on Monday to discuss the memorandums on approaches to negotiating peace prepared by the sides. “The ball is in Ukraine’s court: either talks followed by peace or imminent defeat on the battlefield with different conditions for ending the conflict,”the envoy insisted.",

    "title": "Russia has ‘fair concern’ about NATO expansion – Trump envoy",
    "article_text": "Russia’s long-standing security concerns regarding NATO expansion are reasonable, US presidential envoy Keith Kellogg said Thursday in an interview with ABC News He was responding to a question about reports that Moscow wants NATO leaders to issue a written commitment halting further enlargement – particularly the inclusion of Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia into the US-led military bloc. “It’s a fair concern and we’ve said that repeatedly … that to us Ukraine coming into NATO is not on the table,”he said. “We’re saying: okay, comprehensively we can stop the expansion of NATO coming close to your border,”Kellogg added, noting that such a move would ultimately require a presidential-level decision. Towards the end of the Cold War, senior US officials gave assurances to the Soviet Union that NATO would not expand eastward, in exchange for support for German reunification. Since the 1990s, Moscow has cited the alliance’s expansion to Russia’s borders as evidence of Western duplicity. NATO’s insistence on admitting Ukraine to the bloc is a key factor which led to the current conflict with Russia. In 2021, Moscow offered a diplomatic proposal to ease tensions, but the US and other bloc members insisted its open-door policy was non-negotiable, describing Ukraine’s path to membership as“irreversible.” Moscow hopes to hold a new round of negotiations with Kiev on Monday in Istanbul, where both parties would exchange draft memorandums on the next steps in the peace process, including a conditional cease-fire. Ukrainian officials have expressed frustration at not receiving the Russian draft in advance and said they might boycott the meeting. “I always caution [Kiev’s chief negotiator Rustem Umerov]: don’t say things like that,”Kellogg said.“Part of life is showing up, and you need to show you’re serious.” Russia and Ukraine reached a preliminary peace agreement in Istanbul in 2022, but Kiev later withdrew from talks, aiming for a military breakthrough with support from Western nations. Moscow sees the renewed talks launched earlier this month as a chance to revisit the proposal, which involves Ukraine adopting a stance of neutrality and limiting its military. The interviewer pressed Kellogg on whether those terms were“pretty extreme,”suggesting they were proof that Russia does not seek peace. Kellogg responded that ending the conflict was in Moscow’s interest.",

    "title": "How to manage your blood sugar with exercise through strength and interval training",
    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Women People Women Women Wellness Wellness Wellness Women Living Singapore Singapore Living Style & Beauty Obsessions Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Experiences Travel Dining Dining Travel Experiences Singapore Experiences Wellness Wellness Movement can be a powerful medicine for people with diabetes and other forms of insulin resistance. But intensity and timing can make a difference. (Art: The New York Times/Jiaqi Wang) These days, more and more of us have to worry about our blood sugar. Some38 million Americans have diabetes, and more than two times that number have pre-diabetes. Many millions more have some form of insulin resistance, which can make you tired, irritable and even dizzy. And all of these conditions becomemore common as we age. The good news is that exercise can help. It’s at least as important as your diet for preventing and treating insulin resistance and diabetes. It can also help youlose weight, which is often the most important step in levelling out blood sugar. Exercise has several unique ways to help your body process glucose, said Dr Donald Hensrud, a specialist in preventive medicine and nutrition and medical editor of The Mayo Clinic Diet. And while any exercise is good for you, the type of movement you choose and when you do it can play a big role in how much it helps. Here are some things you should think about when planning workouts, according to experts. The causes of diabetes are complex. Family history, genetics, weight and diet certainly play a role. But it’s clear that exercise can dramatically lower your blood glucose, regardless of your diagnosis, and improve how well your body uses insulin. In fact,research has shownthat exercise is generallymore effectiveat preventing diabetesthan medication(though it is important touse all types of treatment). During exercise, your muscle cells can more easily use the glucose in your blood. This lowers blood sugar directly and can also reducethe fat around your organs, an important risk factor for diabetes and insulin resistance, said Dr Gerald I Shulman, a professor of medicine and physiology at the Yale School of Medicine. In particular,studies showthat regular high-intensity interval training or moderate continuous exercise can make a difference, reversing pre-diabetes in almost 40 percent of the participants–although it could take months or even years for many people to see long-lasting changes. Any movement is better than none, and simply going for a walk can have benefits. But according to research, the two most effective ways to lower your blood sugar through exercises arehigh intensity workoutsandstrength training. A recent studyfound strength training was significantly more effective for controlling blood sugar levels than aerobic exercise for people with Type 2 diabetes, and this likely holds true for other peopleworried about their blood sugar, Dr Shulman said. Also, both aerobic exercise and strength training create more mitochondria,which can help fight Type 2 diabetes, but weight lifting appears to be slightly more effective than aerobic exercise, assuming you are pushing yourself, Dr Shulman said. Strength training is especially important for older people,since insulin resistanceand Type 2 diabetesacceleratethe normal loss of muscleand strength that comes with age, particularly for women. And while walking is good exercise for the heart, it generally won’t build much muscle, said Michael Joseph Gross, author of Stronger: The Untold Story of Muscles in Our Lives. The way you strength train is also important, he added. To be most effective, theweights should feel heavy. Asystematic reviewof the research found lifting challenging weights helped lower blood sugar more effectively than low-intensity strength training. Consider alternating your strength training session withhigh-intensity interval training, which has been shown to beespecially effectivein man ageingblood sugar for people with pre-diabetes andType 2 diabetes. If you have diabetes, consult a doctor before radically changing your fitness regimen. If you do not have insulin resistance, the time of day you work outdoesn’t mattermuch. But for people with pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes,studies suggestthatafternoon exercisetends tohelp reduce blood sugar levels. This is because blood sugar rises and falls in regular patterns over the course of the day, and as the day goes on, the body becomes less insulin sensitive. Thus afternoon exercise is typically less likely to cause dangerous glucose spikes. Expertsrecommend working outat least three days per week with no more than two days in a row without activity. For people with insulin resistance, including diabetes, the best time to exercise is about30minutes afterstartinga mealto prevent blood sugar spikes. If morning workouts fit better with your schedule, try not to eat too many carbohydrates beforehand and start the day with a small meal ofprotein andhealthy carbohydrateslike fruit, vegetables and whole grains. Pre-diabetes and new-onset diabetes are much more responsive to lifestyle changes like diet and exercise than longer-term cases, Dr Hensrud said, so it’s important to address insulin resistance as soon as possible. “I tell people with new diabetes they’re in control,” he said, “and the most important thing to do is decrease weight through dietary changes and exercise.” By Hilary Achauer © The New York Times Company The article originally appeared inThe New York Times.

    "title": "The unexpected symptoms of OCD beyond hand-washing and light-switch rituals",
    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Women People Women Women Wellness Wellness Wellness Women Living Singapore Singapore Living Style & Beauty Obsessions Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Experiences Travel Dining Dining Travel Experiences Singapore Experiences Wellness Wellness Disturbing thoughts and social fixations are among the many manifestations of obsessive-compulsive disorder. (Art: The New York Times/Vanessa Saba) When most people think of obsessive-compulsive disorder, they may picture behaviours they’ve seen on TV–like repetitive hand-washing, flicking light switches on and off and meticulously arranging small items over and over. But the disorder manifests in many other ways. Some patients obsess over thoughts that they might hurt someone, while others fixate on certain aspects of their personal relationships. The comedian Maria Bamford, for example, hascalled her OCD“unwanted thoughts syndrome.” On The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, she shared a story about how she couldn’t stop thinking horrific thoughts about her family members. On social media, people describe many types of obsessions and compulsions: “Relationship OCD,” “sexual orientation OCD” or “emotional contamination OCD”. These aren’t separate diagnoses, but rather they are different expressions of the same disorder–much like how people with phobias can suffer from different fears, said Dr Carolyn Rodriguez, an OCD expert and a professor of psychiatry and behavioural sciences at Stanford Medicine. Understanding these distinctions can help clinicians tailor a precise treatment plan, she added. And they’re important for the public to grasp as well. Otherwise, people who experience the disorder might not even recognise they have it, Dr Rodriguez said. People who are fearful of harming others might think, “Maybe I am a murderer,” she added. “If I tell anybody these things, I’m going to be put in jail.” Here’s what to know about the diverse ways that OCD shows up. OCD involves a set of obsessions and compulsions that cause great distress and affect people’s quality of life. Obsessions can include unwanted intrusive thoughts, images or urges that dominate the mind. Compulsions are the repetitive actions that people take in response to their obsessions to try to help themselves feel better. These OCD symptoms can be time consuming, lasting for at least an hour a day, according to the diagnostic manual used by mental health practitioners. If someone worries excessively that they will set the house on fire by accidentally leaving the stove on, for instance, they might check again and again to make sure the knobs are in the off position. About2.3 per centof American adults are estimated to have had OCD at some point in their lifetime, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Women are more likely to receive a diagnosis than men are. More research is needed to further understand the origins of OCD, which is thought to have genetic and environmental causes. While all of those with the disorder have obsessions and compulsions, “OCD across patients is almost never exactly the same,” said Jeremy Tyler, co-chief of ambulatory psychiatry at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. People with OCD can differ in many ways, including whether or not they have tics (involuntary, repetitive movements or vocalisations). Patients also vary in their degree of “insight,” which is their level of awareness of being ill, as well as in how they feel when their symptoms are triggered. Another way patients differ is in the content of their obsessions and compulsions. Concerns about contamination, a need for symmetry or order, forbidden or taboo thoughts and a fear of harming others or yourself are common themes, said Dr Helen Blair Simpson, a psychiatry professor and OCD researcher at Columbia University. TheInternationalOCDFoundationlists other themes as well, including sexual thoughts; fixations on relationships; worries that tie into responsibility, like being responsible for something terrible happening; or fears related to perfectionism, like showing excessive worry over making mistakes. Patients and therapists have labelled some of these themes in online forums, coining terms like “symmetry and order OCD” and “perfectionism OCD”. Creating names for different expressions of OCD may help sufferers feel less alone, Dr Rodriguez said. Often, more than one theme can be present at the same time, and the content of a person’s obsession or compulsion can change over the course of the illness, the experts said. OCD is typically treated with an antidepressant, exposure and response prevention therapy, or both. Therapy involves asking patients to experience their stress and anxiety without performing a compulsion in response. Therapists will also encourage patients to allow their obsessions to surface rather than continually try to push them away. It’s particularly important for therapists to know someone’s “type” when carrying out exposure and response prevention therapy, because clinicians can then ensure that their patients are being exposed to the precise types of situations that typically stir up their obsessions, Dr Tyler noted. “I eat food off the ground with people; I hold knives with people,” he said. It may sound “wild,” he added, but in the process, patients learn that the thing they fear the most isn’t likely to happen.

    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Women People Women Women Wellness Wellness Wellness Women Living Singapore Singapore Living Style & Beauty Obsessions Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Experiences Travel Dining Dining Travel Experiences Singapore Experiences Travel Travel A culinary road trip through Okinawa reveals an eclectic cuisine shaped by centuries of cultural exchange. From Blue Seal ice cream to Okinawa soba from Susuriba, Okinawa's eclectic cuisine has been shaped by centuries of cultural exchange. (Photos: Lam Shushan) This audio is generated by an AI tool. You walk into a local restaurant in Okinawa, and on the menu are its bestsellers: Okinawa soba, a dish that feels unmistakably Japanese; chanpuru, a stir-fry of bitter melon, egg, and tofu – also a common South China or Southeast Asia dish; and then, oddly, a Tex-Mex style taco rice. To the uninitiated, it might come across as a cuisine with no clear identity, but this culinary mash-up has deep roots. Okinawa was once the independent Ryukyu Kingdom, a prominent trade partner with imperial China and Southeast Asia for centuries, before it was annexed by Japan, then later occupied by American forces after WWII. Each era left its mark in the language, the culture, and especially the food. Today, Okinawa is Japan’s most popular domestic holiday spot, and an increasing number of travelers from East Asia and Southeast Asia are making their way there too, thanks to more direct flights (Jetstar flies direct from Singapore three times a week). Part of the allure? Subtropical weather, some of the best dive spots in the world, pristine, uncrowded beaches next to five-star resorts – no wonder it’s called the “Hawaii of Japan” by some. But if you ask us – start with the food. Because not only is it a delicious, underrated side of Japanese cuisine with tropical twists and turns, it’s also an easy way to get acquainted with the island’s layered history and culture. So if you’re planning a trip, let this culinary guide be your way in. ROYAL COURT CUISINE Back in the days of the Ryukyu Kingdom, Okinawa was a tributary state of Ming China, and food played a diplomatic role. Royal chefs were sent to China to train, returning with refined dishes meant to impress visiting envoys. Served in elegant lacquerware, these became the foundation of Ryukyu court cuisine. After the kingdom was abolished by Imperial Japan in the late 1800s, these once-exclusive dishes gradually made their way to the masses. A post shared by 琉球料理 ぬちがふぅ (@nuchigafu) Today, you can still taste that royal heritage in Naha city.Ryukyu Cuisine Miestands out for its traditional, pared-back style, whileNuchigafuin the quaint pottery neighbourhood of Tsuboya andOmoro Dun-chijust outside the center offer a more homely take in charming, old-style settings. IZAKAYAS For a more casual take on Okinawan food, hit up a local izakaya. The lively atmosphere in these eateries are perfect for sharing small plates over drinks. One staple to try is goya chanpuru – a bitter melon stir-fry with egg and tofu. Variations may include ingredients like okra or even Spam, a pantry staple dating back to the American postwar era. The word chanpuru means “something mixed,” and is said to originate from the Malay word “campur” – a nod to the multicultural influence on Okinawa’s cuisine. A post shared by Adam Liaw (@adamliaw) Other favourites include a mochi-textured peanut tofu, tender pork belly simmered in local rice wine and squid ink somen – a thin noodle alternative to soba, usually served stir fried. Popular izakayas in Naha includeYunangiandDachibin, both local favourites known for their buzz and variety. If you spot Agu pork on the menu, order it. This Okinawan native breed is prized for its marbled richness, often dubbed the wagyu of pork. For a dedicated experience, head toShima Buta-ya, a restaurant that specialises in all things Agu.Not to be missed are the black sesame pork and side dishes like peanut tofu and fried yam. Tip:These places fill up fast – go early or make a reservation to avoid the queue. OKINAWA SOBA Okinawa soba is to the islanders what ramen is to the mainland Japanese – an everyday staple with countless variations, but the fun is in trying them all. Typically, expect thick, chewy wheat noodles in a clear, light broth, topped with sweet-savoury pork belly, fishcake and ginger slices. In Naha, try the Insta-famousEibun(expect to queue), or go hyper-local atSusuriba Okinawa Soba, where ordering is done vending-machine style – no-frills and tucked in a nightlife-heavy neighbourhood of Matsuyama. For something different, head toRestaurant Arinkayain Minatogawa Stateside Town – a repurposed American military housing area now home to indie boutiques and cafes. The chef, originally from Yonaguni Island, brings a southern twist to the classic bowl. MAKISHI PUBLIC MARKET Located along the main Kokusaidori Street, this 74-year-old establishment is a great sampling ground for fresh Okinawan produce, from tropical fruit to fresh seafood which can be purchased and prepared on the spot at one of the restaurants on the second level. You’ll also find stalls selling traditional fare like fishcakes – a delicacy enjoyed during Shimi, Okinawa’s tomb-sweeping festival. Much like Qing Ming in Chinese culture, families gather at ancestral graves to offer food and share a meal together. Keep an eye out too for traditional snacks like Okinawan donuts – a treat with roots in South China.Nansei Donuts(previously located opposite the market, with plans to relocate as of April 2025) is known for frying them fresh to order, offering contemporary flavours like lemon, mugwort, and brown sugar. Tip:For a food-focused stay in Naha, consider OMO5 Okinawa Naha, located in the heart of Matsuyama, Naha’s buzzing nightlife and dining district. In the lobby, you’ll find an interactive map of top local eats curated by insiders – or enjoy Okinawan dishes at the in-house cafe, which serves dishes from beloved neighbourhood restaurants. The hotel also offers daily Awamori (a local rice wine) tastings and English-language market tours for a deeper dive into local food culture. After Japan’s surrender in WWII, Okinawa came under US administration until 1972. During this time, the island became home to one of the most strategic American military bases in the Asia-Pacific – and with it, a wave of American cultural influence that still lingers today. Nowhere is this more visible than in Okinawa’s love for American-style diners. In Chatan, you’ll findRuler’s Taco Rice, a diner dedicated to the dish that defines Okinawa’s East-meets-West culinary identity. Taco rice – ground beef and salsa over fluffy Japanese rice, topped with shredded lettuce, cheese, and other fixings – was born out of the island’s military presence but is now beloved by locals. Be sure to order a side of their onion rings. Blue Seal Ice Cream, a local institution, began in 1948 as a dairy supplier to the US military. While you’ll find outlets all over Okinawa, the newly-renovatedMakiminato branchis worth a visit. Styled like a 1950s diner straight out of Grease, it features a small exhibit on the brand’s history and the full lineup of flavours. This writer’s top picks: Strawberry cheesecake and Okinawan salt cookies. If you're road-tripping up north, swing bySea Side Drive-In– Okinawa’s oldest drive-in, opened in 1967 by a refrigerator mechanic who once worked with the American military and was inspired by the diner-style restaurants on base. This roadside institution is loved by locals for its order-at-the-window charm and hearty fare: Think oxtail stew, cream of mushroom soup, and a surprisingly great club sandwich. The vibe is reminiscent of a Hainanese-Western cafe one would find in Singapore. Another worthwhile stop if you’re heading north toward Cape Zanpa isCape Zanpa Drive-In, known for its crispy chicken burgers. Add a side of homemade slaw and freshly fried sweet potato chips. This humble diner is also the perfect spot to kick back and enjoy the sunset after a day of road tripping and sight-seeing. Okinawa is one of the world’s five Blue Zones – regions with the highest concentration of centenarians. One village in particular stands out: Ogimi, in the island’s north, where it’s not uncommon to see old folks tending to their vegetable gardens with quiet vitality. Many elderly folk are self-sufficient and aging healthily. Ogimi is also famed for another powerhouse of longevity – Shikuwasa, a local citrus rich in Nobiletin, a compound known for its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties, particularly in combating Alzheimer’s. Two stops not to miss: EMI NO MISE For lunch, head to Emi no Mise, a humble eatery where you’re served a longevity meal in the owner’s own home. Expect a nourishing spread of homegrown, home-pickled, mostly plant-based dishes — all prepared with care and tradition. Seating is very limited, so reservations are essential. A post shared by 金城笑子 (@eminomise) SHIKUWASA PARK While you will find Shikuwasa juice all over Okinawa, here you’ll get to taste it right at the source. The park offers English-language tours that take you through the production process and highlight the fruit’s health benefits. Don’t leave without stocking up on some Shikuwasa produce, with everything from cakes, sweets, and juice concentrates. A post shared by 大宜味シークヮーサーパーク | 沖縄 | やんばる | シークヮーサー専門店 (@shikuwasa_park_ogimi) Long before sake or shochu, there was awamori – Japan’s oldest distilled rice liquor, with roots tracing back to Okinawa’s trade with Thailand and China in the 15th century. The technique eventually made its way to mainland Japan, evolving into the sake and shochu we know today. Yet despite its heritage, awamori remains under the radar, often dismissed as an \"old man’s drink\" by younger generations. Now, a new wave of bartenders and distillers is breathing fresh life into this forgotten spirit. In Naha, make a beeline for El Lequio – the city’s only mixology bar and a proud entry on Asia’s 50 Best Bars extended list (2023). Portuguese for “the Ryukyu,” El Lequio champions Awamori through inventive cocktails that spotlight local ingredients – think bitter gourd-infused spirits and house-made awamori blends. Behind the bar is Satoshi Sugiura, a visionary bartender who partners with local farmers and producers to craft his own spirits. His efforts have taken Okinawan liquor to new heights – including guest shifts around some of Asia’s top bars.

    "article_text": "Experiences Experiences Experiences Experiences Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions People People People People Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Experiences Experiences Istanbul offers an extraordinary array of eating options, from roadside stalls to elegant dining rooms, local smoky grills to cutting-edge neo-Turkish bistros. Istanbul, Türkiye’s largest city – once known as Constantinople and famous for straddling both Europe and Asia – also marks a culinary crossroads. (Photo: Chris Dwyer) This audio is generated by an AI tool. Türkiye’s largest city, once known as Constantinople and famous for straddling both Europe and Asia, also marks a culinary crossroads. The remarkable diversity of influences and people who have called it home ensure that it is one of the world’s most thrilling places to dine out. Such a metropolis – more than 15 million people call it home – offers an extraordinary array of eating options, from roadside stalls to elegant dining rooms, local smoky grills to cutting-edge neo-Turkish bistros. Here are six spots for guaranteed deliciousness, authentic hospitality and windows on Turkey’s remarkable, multi-layered culinary culture. Taking up the ground floor of a modest Novotel hotel, Karakoy Cafe is an unassuming spot but a surefire winner for those seeking real-deal Turkish cuisine. Bookings are essential as it fills up quickly with local families and larger groups enjoying impeccable plates, while the interiors and design are elevated and elegant, the service warm and the prices distinctly fair. The eyes are immediately drawn to a long, refrigerated counter, not unlike those in tapas bars, filled with a tempting array of mezze which are also listed on a long menu. Muhammara has long been a personal favourite, a sweet and spicy paste of peppers, walnuts and herbs, but the version at Karakoy is also cut through with fresh parsley for added freshness. A roasted aubergine salad, patlican salatasi, is another notch above the normal thanks to the smoky char on the vegetables, slowly blistered on the restaurant’s vast grill. Oven-baked sheep’s cheese with spices marked the final mezze, a simple but excellent addition, especially with their addictive breads hot from the oven. An extensive wine and raki list accompany the food, along with plenty of no-alcohol choices. Fatih Tutak is arguably Türkiye’s most famous celebrity chef, a regular sight on TV and someone who proudly flies the flag for his country’s cuisine. He boasts a distinguished resume which includes Türkiye’s only two Michelin-starred restaurant, Turk Fatih Tutak, as well as the highly acclaimed Gallada at The Peninsula Istanbul. The hotel is an absolute beauty, sweeping along The Bosporus riverfront, featuring three separate buildings, including an Art Deco pearl which was once a ticket office for a ferry company. Another is crowned by Gallada with its vast terrace, incredible views over Hagia Sofia mosque and generous tables decked in pristine white linen. Every seat is taken, and the room buzzes with energy and a United Nations of accents. As the plates begin to arrive, it’s clear why. Perfect batons of pickles are joined by Sichuan peanuts and a Turkish pinot noir, before the first course of lamb’s liver with Kesan pepper and crispy potato, to be wrapped in gossamer-thin bread. Surely Istanbul’s most elegant lamb shashlik kebab comes next, with vinegary onion, cumin and paprika, then Black Sea turbot with superior soy and morel mushrooms reflecting chef Fatih’s years spent in Asia, in cities including Hong Kong and Bangkok. Frozen chocolate mousse with Madagascar vanilla rounds out a spectacular a la carte dinner. It’s probably unsurprising that Istanbul’s Bank Hotel was once a bank, one where sublime originalinteriors and architecture have been highlighted and restored with true style. One of its restaurants sits up on the sixth floor, with romantic views over the mosques of Sultanahmet and beyond. Serica’s cuisine is neo-Turkish, namely rooted in tradition but unafraid to experiment and innovate. It also reflects regions including Anatolia, the Black Sea coast and Cappadocia. Dinner started with bread from a tandoor style oven, served volcanically hot with basil and herb butter. A crunchy rectangle of bread was then topped with anchovies, bottarga and aioli, a trio of powerful ingredients which nonetheless complimented one another well. The tandoor came to the fore again with fall-apart tender lamb shoulder, slow cooked and served with stuffed onion and apricot puree. More excellent Turkish wines paired perfectly. Open-fire grills called mangal proudly define Turkish cuisine more than any other. Always smoke-filled, invariably involving a wait to get a table, their friendly, communal atmosphere celebrates kebabs beautifully kissed by charcoal-fuelled fire in a tradition known as Ockabsi. There are thousands of them across Istanbul, but one of the best we encountered was Adana Ockabsi in the Osmanbey neighbourhood. Taking inspiration from the culinary traditions of Adana on Türkiye’s Mediterranean coast,go with as many people as possible to enjoy as wide a spread of dishes as your table can hold. Wood-fired breads are dangerously addictive, especially swept through rich and creamy meze dips. Fragrant hand-chopped kebabs are moulded around huge sword-like skewers, while some offer kokorec, made from lamb or goat intestines wrapped around seasoned offal such as sweetbreads, hearts or lungs. To drink, the aniseed flavours of the strong national liquor raki are an acquired taste but an important communal toasting tradition. Just be warned that after a few shots you may find yourself wanting to hit another bar to carry on well into the night. Kumpir – a unique Turkish take on baked potatoes – is seen all over Istanbul, but the riverside district of Ortakoy is particularly famed for them, with lanes dotted with dozens of vendors trying to outdo one another with eye-catching displays of dozens of toppings. There’s no science or culinary wizardry at work, just huge fluffy spuds, cleaved open and spread with liberal amounts of butter. The only challenge comes in choosing what to fill them with. Red cabbage, chopped olives, sweetcorn, pickled vegetables, chopped eggs, sausage, pepper, tuna, cheeses like kasar or mozzarella – the only limit is your imagination and appetite. The best bit? They’re more than enough for a meal, perfect eaten al fresco in the gardens around Ortakoy Bridge – and run no more than US$3 (S$3.85) to US$4. At weekends, you can expect large crowds as the treat is understandably popular with families wandering the pedestrianised streets. Just look for a street known as Kumpir Sokak by the Ortakoy mosque and get stuck in. Incredible produce is piled high on low tables across Istanbul’s hundreds of neighbourhood food markets. The freshest fish and seafood, incredible fruit and vegetables and fascinating local characters make for a great culinary cocktail. Have a look online to see what’s on and don’t be afraid to jump on a ferry to head out into the depths of the city, away from the tourist traps. I found artichoke hearts floating in red buckets of water, ruby-red beetroot, massive mountains of aubergines, carefully arranged pyramids of tomatoes and beautifully fragrant herbs as just some of the tempting ingredients. Dried fruit and nuts are another specialty, with tables covered in walnuts that are carefully picked through by discerning local grandmothers. Simply follow your nose for something delicious to chew on as you wander. Simit are the ubiquitous sesame-flecked rings of bread, sold from portable carts. Stalls sell all manner of homemade borek, the addictive layered pastry with salty white cheese, while whorls of pastry are stuffed with nettles, spinach, herbs and more cheese to be washed down with a glass of strong and sweet Turkish tea.

    "title": "Commentary: Trump’s unpredictable tariffs leave US trade partners in limbo",
    "article_text": "Commentary Commentary Governments have no clarity when President Donald Trump's tariffs may be overturned by US courts in weeks or months, says Deborah Elms of Hinrich Foundation. US President Donald Trump delivers remarks on tariffs in the Rose Garden at the White House in Washington DC, Apr 2, 2025. (Photo: Reuters/Carlos Barria) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: The past few days have provided another reminder of the unusual and rapidly changing nature of US President Donald Trump’s signature trade agenda. Two courts have struck downthe use of tariffs as a policy tool. A quick appeal has, in turn,temporarily allowed the administrationto continue to collect tariffs on imports. Fentanyl-related tariffs and the universal application of 10 per cent reciprocal tariffs are still in effect. The sudden legal uncertainty has thrown foreign trade partners into disarray. On Apr 2, Mr Trump imposed reciprocal tariffs on all US trade partners at levels between 10 to 50 per cent. One week later, the White House paused tariff collection above 10 per cent for 90 days to allow time for negotiations. This window is expiring in early July, leaving governments scrambling to find a deal to keep higher assessments from taking effect. The only constant in this volatile situation isMr Trump’s love for tariffs. His justification for using tariffs has varied. He likes that tariffs result in revenue flowing into the US federal budget. He thinks tariffs will encourage foreign firms to invest in the United States and return domestic manufacturing jobs back to a heyday of the 1950s. He believes that tariffs provide leverage to get foreign governments to negotiate over a range of trade and economic irritants. On his first day in office, Mr Trump used a specific domestic tool, called the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), to impose tariffs against China, Canada and Mexico for failure to effectively manage fentanyl. He used the same statute on Apr 2 to introduce reciprocal tariffs. But on May 28, the Court of International Trade (CIT), a specialised court system in the United States to manage economic cases, ruled against the president for his use of IEEPA. In the eyes of the court, IEEPA was incorrectly used because neither fentanyl nor bilateral trade deficits in goods constitutes an emergency, and IEEPA does not allow the president to impose tariffs as a remedy. Another court in the District of Columbia reached similar conclusions. Both courts asked that tariffs be removed within 10 to 14 days and that presidents refrain from the use of IEEPA in such a manner in the future. Both legal cases have been unfolding largely behind the scenes for months. Observers were caught off guard, however, by the speed with which both delivered verdicts. The unanimous verdict of the CIT panel, which included judges appointed by three different US presidents, strengthened the impact of the court’s assessment. While some of Mr Trump’s inner circle have argued that the decisions should be seen as a minor bump in the road, the willingness of the legal establishment to take on the executive branch and deliver a sweeping verdict suggests that checks and balances against the president’s power on trade and economic policy still exist. The Trump administration quickly filed an appeal and asked for a stay of the lower court decision pending legal outcomes in the case. This stay has been granted and the examination of IEEPA authority is likely to end up before the Supreme Court. Given that these IEEPA-imposed tariffs may be overturned in a few weeks or months, it is not clear whether governments should continue to negotiate, slow the process of talks, or simply wait until there is greater clarity on the future application of reciprocal tariffs. Regardless, tariffs will continue to be applied by Mr Trump. The courts have ruled on IEEPA, but have left in place Section 232 tariffs for national security and Section 301 tariffs for unfair trade practices. Section 232 tariffs are already in place for products with metals, autos and auto parts. Seven more categories of goods, including pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, are waiting to be rolled out. Section 232 cases are global in nature, affecting all US trade partners. Section 301 is in effect with China from Mr Trump’s first term in office, with a new use of the legal provision recently for shipbuilding. The administration also has a range of other domestic trade tools that could be tried, such as Section 122, which allows the use of 15 per cent tariffs for a limited time period. Even the withdrawal of all IEEPA tariffs would leave the US with significantly elevated tariffs in place. Prior to Mr Trump’s return to the White House, average tariffs were approximately 2 per cent. They have now soared to 18 per cent largely because of Section 232 tariffs. The past few days have highlighted the highly unusual and uncertain nature of trade, with US tariff policies that can be applied, suspended or postponed in a matter of hours. The uncertainty surrounding trade and tariffs is, unfortunately, set to continue. Deborah Elms is Head of Trade Policy at Hinrich Foundation.

    "title": "Commentary: The world of work is much more pleasant than we expected",
    "article_text": "Commentary Commentary Longer effective working lives have so far offset ageing populations, says Chris Giles for the Financial Times. This audio is generated by an AI tool. LONDON: There is a market for sweeping economic analyses, generally predicting that the sky is about to fall on our heads. Thomas Malthus arguably started it with his 18th-century prediction that population growth would always run ahead of food production. He was unlucky in having his conjecture picked over for centuries. Normally, economists get away with it. Before reading the IMF’s recent long-term prediction of global labour markets, therefore, I felt the need to go back a quarter of a century to see what similar organisations were forecasting. The OECD’s 2000 report on “reforms for an ageing society” is representative of the thinking at the time and its logic remains sound. Baby boomersin middle age would start to retire in the 2000s, it predicted, ensuring that total employment as a proportion of the population would start falling from 2010. This drop would be mitigated by more women working, but overall, the effective working life of someone in an advanced economy would hover around 34 to 35 years. “The data suggests retirement and active ageing are not yet going hand-in-hand,” the OECD concluded, adding, patronisingly, that evidence showed older people simply spent time on “more television-watching and sleep”. What nonsense. Even though the world has had its fair share of economic crises since the millennium, the proportion of the population in employment is showing signs of rising rather than falling. An end to shorter male working lives and much higher employment rates among women have also ensured thateffective working liveshave risen beyond 38 years, far more than expected. Almost everything that the OECD described as a challenge has improved significantly. It is not often that columnists write about what has gone right, so it is worth examining why jobs and lifetime employment have done so much better than previously thought. The OECD might like to claim that these changes were caused by its own warnings, prompting governments to reform labour markets and retirement systems. It is a comforting thought for those working in international organisations, but highly unlikely. In a telling recent study, economists at Goldman Sachs noted there was precious little correlation between longer working lives and changes in official retirement ages in different countries. The trend towards longer working lives has taken place almost regardless of whether governments have undertaken targeted policy reform. Instead, both Goldman Sachs and the IMF account for most longer working lives by a list of good news:increased longevity; older workers enjoying jobs in which experience allows more autonomy; and enlightened employers valuing this experience. The world of work may be rather better than we feared. Of course, this positive story cannot cover every employee in every workplace. The lower paid often work longer — or retire but then return to the workforce — to have even a basic living standard in retirement. This has been mitigated by the fall in male manual labour, so there are no longer large numbers of men physically unable to do their jobs, and that should persist as long as Donald Trump doesn’t get his way with a return to manufacturing roles. The IMF showed increased cognitive faculties of older people over the last 25 years have been the biggest driver of the ability to work longer. As far as our brains are concerned, 70 really is the new 50, it concluded, so these trends can continue. Further efforts to make jobs work for older people can mitigate three-quarters of the projected slowdown in global growth due to ageing in the next 25 years, the IMF predicted. I know this is another bold forecast from economists. But the positivity is new and striking. Healthy ageing is a huge prize for our societies. We must grab it.

    "title": "Ukraine keeps Russia guessing over talks, US senator warns Moscow of sanctions",
    "article_text": "World World Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy meets with US Senators Republican Lindsey Graham and Democrat Richard Blumenthal, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in Kyiv, May 30, 2025. (Photo: Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/Handout via REUTERS) KYIV/MOSCOW: Ukraine resisted US and Russian pressure to commit to attendinganother round of peace talkson Monday (Jun 2), saying it first needed to see Russian proposals, while a leading US senator warned Moscow it would be \"hit hard\" by new US sanctions. US President Donald Trump has urged Moscow and Kyiv to work together on a deal to end their three-year-old war, and Russia has proposed a second round of face-to-face talks with Ukrainian officials next week in Istanbul. Kyiv has said it is committed to the search for peace, but that it was waiting for a memorandum from the Russian side setting out their proposals. \"For a meeting to be meaningful, its agenda must be clear, and the negotiations must be properly prepared,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on X on Friday after hosting Türkiye's foreign minister for talks in Kyiv. \"Unfortunately, Russia is doing everything it can to ensure that the next potential meeting brings no results,\" he said, citing the lack of a document from Russia. Delegations from the two countries met in Istanbul on May 16 but the session yielded little other than an agreement for a prisoner exchange. Zelenskyy said he and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Friday discussed in a phone call the conditions under which Ukraine would participate in the Monday meeting proposed by Russia. \"There must be a ceasefire to move further toward peace. The killing of people must stop,\" Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram. \"We share the view that this meeting cannot and should not be empty,\" Zelenskyy said. He did not commit Ukraine to attending on Monday, although he said he and Erdogan did discuss the possibility of organising a four-way meeting with the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Türkiye and the United States. Erdogan said it was important that Russia and Ukraine send strong delegations to Istanbul and added that a leaders' meeting could contribute to the peace process, the Turkish presidency said. Some Republicans in the US Congress and White House advisers have urged Trump to finally embrace new sanctions on Russia to put pressure on Moscow. Influential Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said on a visit to Kyiv the Republican-led US Senate is expected to move ahead with a bill on sanctions against Russia next week. Graham, who met Zelenskyy in Kyiv, told a news briefing he had talked with Trump before his trip and the US president expects concrete actions now from Moscow. Graham accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of trying to drag out the peace process and said he doubts the Istanbul meeting will amount to more than a \"Russian charade.\" \"The game that Putin has been playing is about to change. He is going to be hit, and hit hard by the United States, when it comes to sanctions,\" Graham said. Trump told reporters on Friday that both Putin and Zelenskyy were stubborn and that he had been surprised and disappointed by Russian bombing in Ukraine while he was trying to arrange a ceasefire. Trump made no mention of sanctions. The war, the biggest in Europe since World War Two, began with a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Expectations for the talks are modest because the positions staked out so far by the two sides are far apart and work between them has yet to begin in earnest on narrowing the gap. Nevertheless, both Kyiv and Moscow are keen to demonstrate to Trump they support his peace efforts. Kyiv wants more US military aid, while Moscow hopes Trump will ease existing economic sanctions on Russia. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Russian delegation would be travelling to Istanbul and ready for talks with Ukraine on Monday morning. \"Everyone is focused on the direct Russia-Ukraine negotiations. A list of conditions for a temporary truce is being developed,\" Peskov said. Moscow has said its delegation for Istanbul would be led by Vladimir Medinsky, a Kremlin aide who led the previous round on May 16. Reuters reported this week that Putin's conditions for ending the war include a demand that Western leaders pledge in writing to stop enlarging NATO eastwards. Trump's special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said on Friday that Russia's concern over the eastward enlargement of NATO was fair and Washington did not want to see Ukraine in the US-led military alliance. Commenting on Kellogg's statement, Peskov said: \"We are pleased that these explanations by the president are understood, including in Washington.\" Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told reporters in Kyiv that the next step after talks in Istanbul would be to try to host a meeting between Trump, Putin, and Zelenskyy. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said Kyiv needed to see the Russian proposals in advance for the talks to be \"substantive and meaningful,\" without spelling out what Kyiv would do if it did not receive the Russian document or a deadline for receiving it. \"We want to end this war this year, and we are interested in establishing a truce, whether it is for 30 days, or for 50 days, or for 100 days,\" he said. Russia's UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, told the UN Security Council on Friday that Moscow was ready to consider a ceasefire provided Western states stopped arming Ukraine and Kyiv stopped mobilising troops.

    "title": "Global stocks mixed after Trump accuses China of violating tariff deal",
    "article_text": "World World US flag flutters at the Wall Street entrance of the New York Stock Exchange in New York City, US, Apr 4, 2025. (File photo: Reuters/Kylie Cooper) NEW YORK: Global stocks finished mixed on Friday (May 30) after President Donald Trump put US-China trade tensions back on the boil byclaiming Beijing had \"totally violated\" an agreement with Washington. His social media post came hours after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said trade talks with China aimed at putting to bed sky-high mutual tariffs, currently suspended, were \"a bit stalled\". The development risks renewed trade tensions between the world's two biggest economies. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed higher, while the S&P 500 index was flat, and the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3 per cent. \"If it weren't for the trade war, the market would be feeling pretty good,\" said Tom Cahill of Ventura Wealth Management. \"Inflation is definitely moving in the right direction,\" he added, referencing the Federal Reserve's favoured inflation gauge, which cooled more than expected last month, according to fresh data published Friday. In Europe, London and Germany's major indices ended higher, while France's CAC40 closed lower, following declines in Asian markets earlier in the day. \"If President Trump does slap tariffs back on Chinese imports to the US ... we may see demand for US assets, and the dollar, severely impaired by a chaotic and undiplomatic approach to trade policy,\" said Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB. Despite rumbling concerns about the US-China economic relationship, the markets were little changed by Trump's criticism on social media, with investors appearing to be largely inured to the US president's now-familiar cycle of making dramatic trade threats and then retreating. Investors, traders and analysts instead focused on the Commerce Department's personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index data, which rose 2.1 per cent in the 12 months to April, cooling slightly more than expected. Despite the good news for the Fed, which is looking to bring inflation down to its long-term target of 2 per cent, analysts warned that the fuller inflationary effects of Trump's tariffs were yet to come, and could cause the Fed to maintain its watch-and-wait stance. \"The true weight of these policies is likely to emerge more fully in the months ahead,\" said FOREX.com market analyst Fawad Razaqzada. Investors were also assessing the impact of a US court ruling that invalidated most of Trump's sweeping tariffs, although an appeals court suspended that order and the White House vowed that its tariffs goals would be pursued one way or another. The result leaves Trump's tariff plans in something of \"a legal limbo\" said Stephen Innes, of SPI Asset Management, adding that this sort of legal impasse was \"the kind that keeps traders awake at night.\" In the eurozone, interest rates were in focus after official data showed inflation hovering around the European Central Bank's 2 per cent target. Consumer prices in top EU economy Germany showed a 2.1 per cent rise in May – the same as the previous month – while they fell to 1.9 per cent in Spain, and to 1.7 per cent in Italy. The ECB looks set to lower interest rates again on Thursday. The dollar gained against major currencies, while oil prices were down ahead of a Saturday meeting of eight key OPEC+ members to decide production quotas for July, with some analysts predicting that the cartel could make a larger-than-expected supply hike.

Lucy Bronze, Beth Mead and Chloe Kelly also scored to keep England second in Group 3 of League A with 10 points, behind World Cup winners Spain, who have 12 points after their 5-1 win over Belgium earlier on Friday. Sarina Wiegman's team shrugged off any lingering effects from a tumultuous week that saw goalkeeper Mary Earps' shock international retirement announcement, and were on the front foot from the opening whistle, scoring five goals before the game was 30 minutes old. The 21-year-old Beever-Jones struck her first in the third minute, slotting home from a sharp angle. Subscribe to CNA's Recommended ReadA single handpicked story that we think you shouldn't miss.

The Spaniard believes that the squad's big-game experience over the past two years under his guidance has put them in a strong position to lift the trophy in Munich.

    "title": "The Everybody.World Trash Tee Is Goated, Based, and a Secret Third Thing",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Back in the halcyon days of my youth (read: like, six years ago) I was a svelte, wiry, slip of a man, shredded from 15 years of wrestling. Practically everything I wore fit me perfectly out of the box, and suit shopping was a mercifully simple process. These days, after developing a nastyweightlifting habit—along with a penchant for sucking down half a gallon of skim milk on weekdays and too many Guinness on weekend nights—finding clothes that fit my frame is a challenge. T-shirts present a particular type of hell. It’s not often I find one that fitsjust right, so when I do, I’ve gotta let the people know. Which brings me to the special guest on this installment of “Ian gets his closet together:” the Everybody.World Trash Tee. The elevator pitch? It fits all shapes and sizes—and looks equally terrific on each of them. Everybody.World Everybody.World Everybody.World Everybody.World Close readers of GQ.com already know the Trash Tee as one of ourfavorite white T-shirtson the market, thanks to its biodegradable reclaimed cotton fabric. But it’s also super soft, and equipped with a reinforced neck that doesn’t sag after umpteen spins in the laundry. Its biggest selling point, though, is that Goldilocks silhouette: boxy, and practically begging to be tucked into a pair of classicblue jeans. On the rare occasions I'm not tucking my tees in, I'm going cropped—and Everybody.World's Boxier Trash Tee has me covered there, too. It's just as roomy as its standard counterpart, breathable enough to wear while lounging around the house, and hefty enough to wear to the gym. (Pro tip: Showing a little midriff adds at least 10 pounds to your lifts.) Heck, we like the Trash Tee so much we scored you a sweet little discount on it in the latestGQ Box. Subscribe now and you'll get Everybody.World's hero productplusa whole bunch of editor-approved summer gear, all for $30. My cauliflower ears might still be unfurling, but I recognize the sound of an absurd deal when I hear it. GQ GQ",

    "title": "6 Best Travel Wallets of 2025 for Stress-Free Journeys",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. The Best Travel Wallet OverallLifeventure Travel WalletRead more Amazon The Best Leather Travel WalletBellroy Travel WalletRead more Bellroy The Best Affordable Travel WalletAmazon Basics RFID Travel WalletRead more Amazon You'd be forgiven for thinking a travel wallet is an utterly redundant piece of kit these days. With most boarding passes now residing conveniently on your phone, and the world seemingly digitizing at breakneck speed, surely the need for a dedicated document organizer has vanished? Well, we're here to let you know such a notion couldn't be further from the truth. Global adventures are becoming a necessity for our well-being, andpassports, foreign currency, and a myriad of cards still demand their own perfectly appointed quarters, making the travelwalletnon-negotiable. It’s not simply about carrying your essentials; it’s about carrying them with precision, panache, and the quiet confidence of someone who understands that true style extends to every detail, no matter how small. Forget the days of frantic fumbling at customs or the desperate search for that elusivebaggagetag. The travel wallet is about elevating your journey, streamlining your passage, and ensuring that your most vital documents are always at your fingertips and impeccably organized. So, if you're poised for your next grand escapade or simply looking to bring a touch of sartorial order to your daily commute, considerGQ's definitive guide to the finest travel wallets on the market. Lifeventure Amazon Lifeventure's Travel Wallet has a minimalist design that's available in four colors, including navy blue, olive, grey, and plum. It's made from recycled nylon, which is kind to the environment and suitable for vegans, while the waxed canvas finish means a little bit of rain won't damage your essentials. There's RFID protection, and the entire wallet is zipped, keeping everything secure. There are seven card slots inside, a zipped pocket for coins, and five other internal pockets, as well as an external pocket on the outside for the old-school paper boarding pass. Bellroy Bellroy Bellroy has some lovely travel accessories, and sitting at the classier end of the travel wallet options is this leather number from the brand. It comes in five colors and it’s designed to be around the same size as a passport, though that does mean not all passports will fit inside, specifically German and Irish ones. For other nationalities, there's a dedicated section for your passport, along with a place for tickets, notes and up to 10 cards. There's even a pen included that slots neatly into the fold in the middle because you always need a pen, but you may not always want to strike up a conversation with your plane neighbor. Amazon Basics Amazon Amazon's Basic range not only offers some cheap, sturdy suitcases worth considering if your budget is tight, but this travel wallet will do the job for keeping those travel documents organized too. It's nice and compact, and while it only comes in one color option, it has RFID technology to protect your cards, license and passport, while a rear stash pocket offers easy access to boarding cards and migration documents. The rest of the wallet has a zippered closure and inside, there is space for a pen, passport, notes, coins, and multiple cards. Tumi Amazon Tumi might be best known for its iconic suitcases, but spare a little thought for its Voyageur Zip Around Continental Travel Wallet that keeps your documents organized without adding any unnecessary bulk. It will slide into your suit pocket for a business trip; the gold detailing breaks up the otherwise all black finish; and the nylon and leather combo of materials makes for a durable organizer. The entire wallet is fastened with a zip closure, but you'll also find a zipped pocket on the outside and the inside, along with various other compartments. Fjallraven Amazon Finally, a decent number of color options for anyone looking for a slightly brighter travel wallet. Swedish brand Fjallraven's organizer is water resistant, so if you do get caught in the rain, your passport won't get soggy, while the zip closure keeps everything neatly tucked away, even if you tip it upside down in your fumble at the gate. There's an external pocket for quick access to documents like your boarding pass, while inside, there's space for your phone, a zippered pocket for coins and currency, several card slots, and a main compartment for whatever other small items you have. Samsonite Amazon Samsonite has a long heritage when it comes to luggage, but it's a pro at luggage accessories too, from luggage tags topacking cubes. The RFID Zip Close Travel Wallet has RFID tech as its name suggests, protecting your cards and identity documents, while multiple compartments inside allow for the storage of all your travel essentials. It's not as premium as some of Samsonite's suitcases, but it is as secure as them, with a hidden zipper lock and double-locked strap for extra security. Why do I still need a travel wallet when everything's on my phone? Mobile boarding passes and digital payments have made travel more streamlined, but relying solely on your phone can be a precarious gamble. A premium travel wallet provides a secure, centralized location for your passport—which is still very much a physical necessity—alongside any physical boarding passes, foreign currency, multiple credit cards, and perhaps even a spare SIM card or a key. If your phone battery dies, a well-organized travel wallet gives you an analogue backup, ensuring you're never caught off guard and can navigate international travel without the stress. What features should I look for in a travel wallet? A decent travel wallet goes beyond just storage for your travel essentials. You should first consider the material; a high-quality leather, for instance, not only ages well but offers durability, while RFID blocking technology is a non-negotiable for protecting your sensitive card data from digital skimming. Organization is paramount too. Look for dedicated slots for your passport, multiple card slots that prevent overcrowding, a secure pocket for foreign currency, and perhaps a slip for a customs form or a train ticket. Slimness should also be a factor; you want something that slips discreetly into an inside jacket pocket or carry-on without creating an unsightly bulge. Finally, it's also worth picking a travel wallet with a zip closure for added security, especially when navigating crowded terminals. Is investing in an expensive travel wallet worth it? The initial outlay for a good travel wallet might seem significant, but consider it an investment in security and organization. A cheap, flimsy wallet will quickly show its age and offer little protection for your vital documents. A well-crafted travel wallet, meanwhile, is designed to withstand the rigours of frequent travel, providing peace of mind that your passport and cards are secure. Beyond the practicalities, there's an undeniable elegance to presenting a well-made wallet at a check-in desk or a hotel reception. It's a subtle but powerful statement that speaks volumes about your attention to detail and your appreciation for quality. When it comes to selecting the best travel wallets, we don't simply pluck names from thin air (no pun intended). We have chosen options from thebest luggage brandsaround, while our discerning eyes and experienced travel writers and editors have developed a feel over the years for what makes a decent travel wallet and what to look out for.

    "title": "Zinc Deficiency 101: How to Tell If You Have One",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. When we think of deficiencies, we probably think of the usual suspects:B12, iron, andvitamin D. But a zinc deficiency is a lesser known health issue that you definitely shouldn’t take lightly. Put simply, zinc is one of the common andessential mineralsin our bodies, which has a bunch of different and important functions (more on that later). The rub is that our bodies don’t naturally produce zinc, so we rely on our food to get it. And, of course, anything that has the risk of human behavior or life getting in the way (a.k.a. your diet missing a trick for whatever reason) has some issues. When you’re not getting sufficient levels of zinc from your food, it can have some pretty detrimental effects. To avoid running into some serious health issues, it’s best to read up on zinc so you know what to look out for. From what it is, to what it does, and how to get more of it (and the best to buy), we quizzed three health experts to get the answers. That’s the golden question. Thankfully, it’s one Dr Gina Schoeman, an aesthetic doctor atCREO Clinic, can answer quite succinctly. “Zinc is an essential mineral that plays a crucial role in numerous biological processes within our bodies,” says Schoeman. “It is vital for immune function, protein synthesis, wound healing, DNA synthesis, and cell division. As a cofactor for over 300 enzymes, zinc helps facilitate various biochemical reactions, including metabolism and digestion. But here’s the kicker: “Our bodies cannot store zinc, so we must obtain it regularly through our diet.” When you’re not getting enough zinc through your diet, you may begin to experience several symptoms. These aren't always obviously connected to zinc, and they can range from mildly annoying (duller hair) to medically serious (getting sick often, and with delayed wound healing). “Identifying a zinc deficiency can be tricky since symptoms can be vague and overlap with other nutritional deficiencies,” says Schoeman. “However, if you experience symptoms such as fatigue, frequent infections, or slow wound healing, it might be worth checking your zinc levels. “Additionally, changes in taste or smell, skin problems, orhair losscan also indicate a deficiency. To confirm low zinc levels, a healthcare professional can conduct a blood test.” There are other deficiencies out there where ignoring them would just slow you down. But, because zinc is such a vital part of how our body functions, it’s imperative that you treat a zinc deficiency if you do have one. Personalized nutrition expertRachel Clarksonsays, “Being zinc deficient over the long term can have some serious consequences. Over time, a lack of zinc can lead to more frequent infections, as your immune system weakens, making it harder for your body to fight off illnesses. It can also impact your skin health, causing ongoing issues like slow wound healing, premature ageing or persistent skin problems. Hair thinning or even hair loss can become more noticeable, and prolonged deficiency might affect your mood, leading to feelings of depression or anxiety. In children, it can even stunt growth and delay development. To sum it up: “Keeping your zinc levels in check is essential for staying healthy in the long run!” As mentioned by Clarkson, one of the symptoms you may see if your zinc deficiency worsens is an effect on yourskinandhair. “Zinc [supplements] have been shown to have a positive effect on hair health,” says Schoeman. “It plays a role in hair tissue growth and repair, and adequate levels can help prevent hair loss. Zinc deficiency is often linked to hair thinning and loss, particularly in women.” As for the skin, Clarkson says, “A deficiency in this essential mineral can manifest through several skin-related issues. You might experience dry, flaky patches, nail abnormalities, acne breakouts, or even eczema-like rashes. Cuts and scrapes may also take longer to heal than usual, and in more severe cases, sores can appear around areas like the mouth and eyes. Your skin might become more sensitive and prone to irritation, as zinc plays a crucial role in skin protection. It even helps shield your skin from UV ray damage, so without enough zinc, your skin may struggle to heal from sun exposure.” Another thing that zinc can have an unwanted effect on is yoursexual health. Zinc plays such a vital role in many of your body’s functions—including libido, sperm motility and sperm production. So, like we said: don’t leave your levels unchecked. “Zinc plays a significant role in sexual function and reproductive health for both men and women,” says Harley Street nutritionistClarissa Lenherr, “It is crucial for the production of testosterone, the primary male sex hormone; low levels of zinc have been linked to reduced testosterone levels, which may affect libido and sexual performance. “Additionally, zinc is essential forspermatogenesis, or the production of sperm, and helps maintain sperm motility and overall quality, making adequate zinc levels important for male fertility.” Now that we’ve established that a zinc deficiency is definitely not good, the second golden question is: What do I do about it? The first place to start is your diet. Since our bodies don’t naturally produce zinc, we do need to introduce it via food. “Foods rich in zinc include oysters, red meat, poultry, beans, nuts, whole grains, dairy products, and fortified cereals,” says Schoeman. “Incorporating these foods into your diet can help maintain adequate zinc levels.” As an addition, Clarkson says, “It’s important to note that zinc from plant sources is less easily absorbed by the body than zinc from animal foods.” Despite the absorption rates for plants, there is a way to increase the effectiveness. “For pulses and grains, soaking or sprouting can reduce phytate content, which inhibits zinc absorption, thereby improving zinc bioavailability. Include fermented foods alongside zinc rich foods,” says Lenherr. “Organic acids in fermented foods might help increase zinc absorption.” If your diet isn’t providing all your necessary zinc, you can take asupplementto top things up. However, zincsupplementsaren’t just like a fun and low-risk vitamin C chewy, the correct dose of zinc is very important to nail, as too much is bad for you. “It’s important to note that there is a limit to how much zinc you should take,” says Schoeman. “The recommended dietary allowance for zinc varies by age and gender, but for most adults, it's around 11 mg per day for men and 8 mg for women. Excessive intake can lead to toxicity, resulting in symptoms like nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and headaches.” Additionally, says Lenherr: “If taken in excess or on an empty stomach, zinc can sometimes cause gastric upset, nausea, and diarrhea.” Meanwhile, zinc is also not something you can add to your vitamin andsupplementmorning dose without care. It should not be mixed directly with some other supplements, including iron. “While both zinc and iron are important minerals, taking them together can sometimes reduce their absorption,” says Clarkson. “Zinc and iron compete for the same transport pathways in your body, so if you take high doses of one, it can block the absorption of the other. To get the best out of both, it’s generally recommended to take them at different times of the day or with meals that contain plenty of nutrients to aid absorption. If you need to take both as supplements, consult your healthcare provider to make sure you’re getting the balance right!” If you’ve consulted with your doctor and have agreed a zinc supplement is a good way forward, here some of our recommendations.

    "title": "20 Best Wedding Bands for Men 2025: From Gold to Titanium",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Looking for the best wedding bands for men? Mazels—and brace yourself for a heckuva ride. Finding the right wedding band, for yourself or your soon-to-be spouse, seems like it should be easy; you probably know this person pretty well by now. But, likeplanning a weddingitself, hunting down the ring of your dreams can be deceptively tricky. Maybe you've recently learned that your Prince Charming dreams of nothing more than an extremelybig, bold ringto subvert all the minimal-leaning clothes in his closet. Or, while doing some very important internal reflection, you realized you actually kind of want aclassicwedding band—but nothing too stuffy. There was a time (not all that long ago), when shopping for a men’s wedding band felt fairly restrictive. You essentially had two options:goldorsilver. Maybe a little beveling if you were feeling wild. The ring aisle was less “choose your fighter,” more “accept your fate.” Then slowly, things started to shift. Rings in unexpected materials—titanium, for example—began popping up. Discerning dudes started caring about finish, fit, vibe, dare we sayaura. The beauty of buying a wedding ring in 2025 is that it can come from anywhere and look like anything; it can come wrapped up in a little blue box, it can come from your favorite indie jeweler, it can come in a 12-pack you ordered purely for the express shipping. All that to say, there’s a dizzying array of options out there. And more options, as anyone dealing with a wedding caterer well knows, just means more anxiety. So we’ve narrowed the field to four choice picks for each of the five material categories you’re likely to be considering. Take your time: After all, this is something you’ll (hopefully) never take off. Trends come and go. Gold stays golden. There’s a reason your grandfather wore a gold wedding band, and maybe even his grandfather before him. It’s not just tradition—though there’s plenty of that baked in—it’s because gold is basically a forever metal. Classic, timeless, and quietly flex-worthy, a gold wedding band tells the world you truly appreciate the good stuffandthat you’re not an overthinker. No bad things. It’s expensive, of course, but it doesn’t tarnish, and it’s versatile enough to match your entire wardrobe. Plus, with options ranging from warm yellow to sleek white to moody rose tints, there’s a version of gold that will always be just right for you. Bottom line: if you want a ring that looks great on Day OneandYear Thirty-Five, gold’s got your back (well, finger). John Hardy John Hardy Mejuri Mejuri Bleue Burnham Mohawk General Store Vasiliki SSENSE At first glance, white gold gives off the same polished, versatile tone as silver. But the more time you spend with it, the more you’ll see it’s actually doing a whole lot more. White gold is what happens when something classic meets something a bit more IYKYK. Cool-toned, uber-refined, and built to last way longer than even that piece of wedding cake in the freezer. It’s made by blending pure gold with metals like palladium or nickel, then is usually finished with rhodium plating for a high-shine. Meaning you get the luxe look of platinum without the platinum price tag — along with a ring that can handle whatever life throws at it. If your style leans more minimalist, white gold is the no-brainer upgrade. Timeless without being predictable, and sleek without trying too hard. Piaget Piaget Mejuri Mejuri Buccellati Mr. Porter James Allen James Allen If gold is the classic and white gold is the minimalist, titanium is the modernist. This metal is all about durability. Stronger than steel, lighter than it looks, and tough enough to handle whatever daily life throws its way. You could legit wear it rock climbing, wrench-turning, or accidentally smash it against a subway pole. It’ll be fine. Titanium also brings a sleek, matte finish that feels unfussy and kind of futuristic. For guys who want a ring that’s a little different without going full \"galactic meteorite forged in whiskey and bacon fat,\" titanium expertly walks the line between bold and wearable. Flinn and Steel Flinn and Steel Mejuri Mejuri David Yurman David Yurman Manly Bands Manly Bands There's a reason platinum records are a greater achievement than gold. Not only is the metal heavier than gold and titanium—giving it the heft a ring of this importance deserves—but it's also far more durable than gold, which if plated can require reapplication every few years. Because platinum is naturally white, it also doesn't require the add-ons that white gold does to get (and to maintain) its bright shine. All of this, naturally, comes at a cost. But it's also why the leading lights in the jewelry universe–from Cartier to Tiffany—make such beautiful wedding bands from it. Mejuri Mejuri Cartier Cartier David Yurman David Yurman Tiffany & Co. Tiffany Silicone rings are for the guys who’d rather not think about their ring at all, but still want one that meets the moment. Comfortable, flexible (literally and figuratively), and totally gym-safe, silicone bands are the practical choice for anyone with a more active lifestyle, or with a habit of misplacing valuables. They're also great—and very popular—as a backup for your main band. Whether you're traveling, lifting, working with your hands, or just not in the mood for something shiny that day. With tons of color options, textures, and even “metal-look” finishes, silicone is a very real and increasingly respected alternative to traditional metals. Roq Amazon ThunderFit Rings ThunderFit Rings Enso Enso Rings Qalo Qalo What are the most popular wedding band styles? When it comes to wedding bands, alternative metals like silver are an increasingly popular option, saysBernard James, the Brooklyn-based jeweler behind the eponymousGQ-favorite brand—but gold still reigns supreme. James has also noticed customers gravitating towards traditional silhouettes for the big day, but customizing their rings to make the them feel extra special. “There's something so clean about a classic, semi-round band,” he says. “However, I see a lot of men eager to really spice things up with their main band, or even [buy] a second, more designed band for special occasions. This special touch can come in the form of adding a few stones or playing with the shape altogether.” In other words: If you're a style-pilled person who sees an opportunity to flex, seize it. How do I make sure my ring fits properly? You can order a ring sizer online, but it’s always best to visit your local jeweler IRL—especially if you want to get it right the first time. If you can’t make it to the boutique, James says a sizer will do the trick, just be sure to keep in mind that your fingers swell throughout the day depending on the temperature and (gulp) your diet. “Give yourself some room for any fluctuations, but not too much room, because you don't want it to slip off easily,” says James. “Don't be afraid to ask for 1/4 or 1/2 sizes—it can make a world of difference!” How do I keep this darn thing clean? Much like your soon-to-be-spouse, your wedding ring is supposed to be a keeper—in theory, at least. So how do you ensure it looks pristine through many happy, sun-dappled decades of pure marital bliss? Most solid gold rings can be cleaned the easy way: by washing your hands or wearing them in the shower, James says. (If that feels uncomfortable—or for the real clean freaks—he recommends looking into an ultrasonic cleaner.) But if your ring is so grimy it looks like you unearthed it on your honeymoon to the Acropolis, or you just don’t trust yourself to clean it at home, take it to the pros. Your local jeweler will be able to work its way into all the nooks and crannies you can’t reach with good ol' soap and water.",

    "title": "My Flip-Flops Are None of Your Business",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. If flip-flops are a little too advanced for your feet, try acanvas sneaker,fisherman sandal, or a no-frillsrubber slide. It’s hard to say for sure when shoes got so weird. OnceCrocs became cool, though—followed, in no particular order, bywater shoes,garden clogs, andthe type of sandalsyour grandpa wears to the beach—it felt like a rubicon was crossed. We had reached the point of no return, and I, for one, was happy to be there. I’m something ofa shoe-sayer myself—a TikTok I watched recently noted that every shoe I’ve worn over the last 5 years will be “trending in 2025”—and I take my responsibilities as the officeShoestradumusseriously. I tell you this not to stroke my own ego or flex my bona fides, but as a polite warning: what I’m going to tell you next will probably make you mad. Flip-flops are back, and they’re here to stay. Havaianas Amazon Hari Mari Huckberry For years, flip-flops were banished from polite society, relegated to the beach, the boardwalk, and not many venues in between. But their return should only come as an especially nasty shock if you haven’t been paying attention.Y2K-era styleis ascendant, and the hallmarks of once-bad taste that defined it no longer seem so pernicious. Savvy vintage dealers likeThe Society Archiveare plumbing Abercrombie catalogs for inspiration; brands likeERLhave turned the SoCal beach bum into an avatar of aspirational menswear once again. TheGQsquad clocked the beginning of the flop eraa few years ago, and in the time since I’ve seen more exposed feet on the streets than ever before. Today, there’s a flip-flop for every buyer. Havianas still sells its no-frills rubber version for $20; the Row sells a similar riff for approximately 35 times that. Ancient Greek Sandals Ancient Greek Sandals Rainbow Amazon If this is alarming to you, it shouldn’t be. What, pray tell, are you so afraid of—that your feet will be perceived? Get over it. Look inward, and then downward. Chances are, your toes are clamoring for fresh air—bonus points if you score them a fresh pedicure, too. Save for going barefoot (definitely gross, probably dangerous), flip-flops are the least-precious way to free your piggies from the cage of societal expectation. I’ve been heeding my own advice for months, wearing flip-flops with jeans (raw, healthy break) and a windbreaker when the sun is shining but the air is brisk. If that exact combination doesn’t sound like you, there are umpteen other ways to flop your way through summer. Wear yours with baggy jeans and a hoodie, or cargo shorts and a western shirt. Try a pair with flowy trousers and alinen button-up, or Carhartt double-knees and a thrashed tee, or pleatedIssey Miyake pantsand a fashion-y tank top. Free your toes and your mind will follow.

It’s been pumping out some of the most approachable styles since 1876. The brand’s penny loafers are a gateway drug for guys getting into the loafer life, but its Venetian loafers are a quiet killer in the lineup: timeless, and clean, with just enough character to make heads nod in approval. What You Should Buy Next:One of our editors was also looking for an alternative to the ubiquitous penny loafer, so he opted for theseLemaire slippers, which feature feature a crepe sole and piped upper.

Schwanen Huckberry The Story:The T-Shirt The Bear Made Famous Has a Few New Cousins Why You Bought It:WhenThe Bearblew up the spot of the 215 shirt, old-world craftsmanship collided head-on with a hype train. The Merz B. Schwanen tee, hefty and structured, is made on vintage knitting machines that result in a side-seam-free experience; production couldn’t be scaled to match the hordes of men looking for a crisp white shortcut toJeremy Allen White’s biceps. What’s more, Merz B. Schwanen, culty as it was, could only be found at IYKYK-type menswear havens, but now its availability at places like Huckberry and Nordstrom mean more people can wear the shirt that some of us used to only dream of.

    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Kaitlyn Dever is booked and busy. After deliveringstar-making turnsin both the sleeper-hitApple Cider Vinegarand the latest season of a little show calledThe Last of Us, the Australian actor is ready to talk about it. Just yesterday, Dever pulled up toJimmy Kimmel Live!to cap a whirlwind tour of the press junket, and she wore one of themost iconic sneakerson the planet do it: the Converse Chuck Taylor. The Chuck Taylor, of course, needs little introduction. Sure, folks throw around the word “iconic” pretty liberally these days, but Chucks are the rare sneakers actually worthy of the moniker. Converse's flagship silhouette first hit the hardwood as abasketball shoeover a century ago, and its design hasn't changed much in the time since. (If it ain't broke, etc.) The Chuck Taylor's story hardly ends there, though. In the '40s, Chucks became standard issue for US soldiers across the country. In the '70s, they were adopted by punk rockers, skaters, and basically every cat you associate with countercultural cool. Even after Converse was bought by Nike in the early 2000s, Chucks never really lost their appeal. And while the both companies have been pushing a bevy offuturistic styleslately, nothing hits like the classics. (Just ask Robert Pattinson, who dusted off his own pair at Canneslast week.) Back in January, our colleagues across the pond asked some of the world's foremost sneakerheads about the trendsthat will dominate 2025. “It's not all about new sneakers,” Jeff Staple, the visionary industry veteran noted. While some folks are busy racing towards the future, others will try their best to hold onto the past—“and that's why the Converse Chuck Taylor will also take over collections this year.” From his mouth to Kaitlyn Dever's feet.

    "title": "Why Nothing Hits Like a Late-Night Bowl of Cereal",
    "article_text": "It’s 11:15 p.m. on a Monday.30 Rockis on theTV, there’s a crushed can of seltzer on the coffee table, and I'm experiencing one of life’s great joys: hammering bowl after delicious bowl of Special K Red Berries. Well, more specifically, I’m sucking down medically inadvisable amounts of its Trader Joe’s knockoff, Flakes and Strawberries. I'm hunched over my bowl, trying my best not to spill milk on the oldLife Is GoodT-shirtI have on while simultaneously turning the volume up so I can hear Tina Fey over my thunderous crunching. Thus begins the vicious cycle of finishing my bowl and turning the volume back down because, well,surelythat’ll be the last one I have tonight—but it never is. There is no “last bowl.” There is only “running out of milk.” Let me explain. Growing up, I ate cereal for breakfast just about every day, until wrestling, glorious sport that it is, required me to relegate the sugary loops and puffs of my youth to more of a “treat” classification. They became special occasion foods for eating, say, after a big tournament. So much so that, to this day, my absolute ideal, desert-island dessert wouldn’t be a crème brûlée, tiramisu, or an elaborately constructed croquembouche—it would be a massive bowl of Frosted Flakes. (In fact, just leave me the box and a half gallon of skim, and I’m happy.) But even though wrestling is many years in the rearview, I wouldneverhave cereal for breakfast—and not because I think the cleanup is a lot of work, likemany millennials apparently do. I just like to start my day with a ton of protein, ensuring I’m hitting my macros to fuel my weightlifting hobby—which, for me, is around 225 grams, but who’s counting? (For the record, I am counting. Very meticulously.) Cereal as abreakfast foodhas generally fallen out of fashion for most men I know, specifically my fellow meatheads, who opt for protein-packed smoothies or half a dozen eggs instead of a heaping bowl of Cap’n Crunch. Nor would I have cereal for dinner to cut costs on groceries and appease Big Grain, asthe Kellogg’s CEO controversially suggested. Yet, the masculine urge to inhale oceans of Apple Jacks still hits me night after night—and I’m not alone. With this in mind, cereal brands have even tried to appeal to the midnight crowd in the past (see:Post’s “Sweet Dreams” line, complete with lavender and chamomile flavoring). And with good reason: Practically every dude I know turns to cereal when they’re hungry at night after dinner, including a few of my esteemedGQcolleagues. “It’s the secret to abig bench,” my friend Kent Tor—who (almost) benches as much as I do—tells me. “And if you’re trying to pack in a few extra calories on a bulk, there’s no easier way to do it than a few bowls of cereal before bed.” As performance chef Dan Churchillexplains in this video, high-level athletes also find cereal to be an efficient way to get more calories in too. “There is literally nothing I have to fight the impulse to indulge in more than cereal at night,” Mick Rouse,GQ’s global research director, says. “I love me some Honey Bunches of Oats, but if I'm being totally real (all nutritional considerations off the table), Reese's Puffs is the GOAT cereal. I don't really even keep cereal in the house anymore because I know come 9 p.m., all I'm going to want to do is make a bowl.”GQ’s senior style editor Yang-Yi Goh says that “cereal has always been treated more as a dessert than a breakfast food in my family. And when I just need that little extra kick of sweetness after dinner, there's really nothing I want more than a gigantic bowl of Honey Nut Cheerios.” Meanwhile, our art director Michael Houtz says that “Life, and the existential dread that comes with it, is best served cold...ideally, in a dimly lit kitchen around 3 a.m.\" If there’s one throughline, though, it seems to be nostalgia. “Growing up, my brother, Anders, and I would go through boxes and boxes of sugary cereal by the trough,” Keir Novesky,GQ’s global design director, says. “I still love a big bowl of cereal at any time of the day. But, if I were to power rank when is the best time to enjoy one, the late-night snack bowl would easily be number one. I've loved so many brands over the years, but I'll say the best of them all is Fruity Pebbles—for old time's sake.” Now, all this late-night sugar intake sounds…mildly unhealthy at best, and outright terrible for you at worst. But is eating cereal right before bedtime reallythatbad? “My short answer is that it’s not inherently bad to eat cereal (or anything else) late at night,” registered dietitianAndy De SantistellsGQin an email. But the long answer is more nuanced: “Acid reflux is a relatively common condition, and lying down or reclining too soon after your last meal could increase your acid reflux risk because it takes your stomach time to push food through the digestive tract.” De Santis also says that there's also evidence suggesting that eating too close to bed could disrupt your sleep quality. “Beyond that,” he explains, “my philosophy is that what is healthy at 8 a.m. is healthy at 8 p.m., all else equal.” Fair enough, but what about cereal in particular? According to De Santis, cereal can absolutely be part of a healthy diet. “Imagine one cup of a high-fiber, whole grain cereal sprinkled with cinnamon served with a cup of a high-protein milk with nuts/seeds and berries added,” he says. “By any metric that is averystrong meal and would probably enhance the breakfast quality of the average person significantly.” To be fair: The average guy downing a midnight bowl in a fugue state is probably not taking the time to make sure there’s added fiber. De Santis also notes that for many people with high energy needs and an otherwise balanced diet, hammering a bowl of traditionally “unhealthy” cereal (a.k.a. those low-fiber, low-protein brands) every so often would have minimal consequences. Nutrition aside, what’s the masculine urge to eat cereal at night all about, deep down? Well, for people like me, it’s catching up on what I missed out on when I was a kid, and exerting my power as a fully formed adult—and my God-given right as a red-blooded American man—to fill my body with artificial dyes, empty calories, and delicious sugary flakes while I veg out on the couch after a long day at work. The rest of my life is so calculated, down to the gram, that sucking down bowls of cereal in the middle of the night feels like a final expression of freedom, not to mention a middle finger to the endless sea of Instafluencers telling me towake up at 4 a.m.anddunk my head in ice water. “When my girlfriendleaves me to my own devicesat night, I know the easiest, most satiating thing I can do is eat a bowl of cereal for dinner,” Tyler Chin,GQ’s associate commerce editor, tells me. “It's either that or go out and buy a rotisserie chicken—but a lukewarm, overcooked bird can’t compete with that cold, satisfying crunch.” But for others, it's not about the cereal at all. “I was given a bowl of cereal by my mother every night before bed from, like, the ages of 4 to 12,” Rouse explains. “I was conditioned to expect this sugary, delicious snack as a kid at 8 p.m. after I had taken a bath and gotten all cozy in my pajamas and got to watch one last show before bedtime. And it probably crops up now as this feeling of comfort, which we so rarely have as adults. It's actually a craving rooted in nostalgia and a longing—for when things felt simpler, and safer.”",

    "title": "Timothée Chalamet Unveiled His Knicks-iest Fit Yet for Game 5 at the Garden",
    "article_text": "The Knicks are still alive—and so is Timothée Chalamet’ssartorial heater. For Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals on Thursday night at Madison Square Garden, Chalamet was in his usual courtside perch. While he left theKnicks-inspired Chrome Hearts peanut butter Timbs at home, the rest of the diehard fan’s outfit was supplied by the Hollywood-based brand. Chalamet and his girlfriend, Kylie Jenner, following the Knicks' Game 5 win over the Pacers. We’ve got a striking CH varsity jacket up top with baggy, dark wash jeans below. The pants can only be described asKnicks-in-seven-core, as they’re stamped with theChrome Heartscross logo in the team’s signature colors. The only thing more on the nose would’ve been wearing an actual pair of knickerbockers. His footwear was also Chrome Hearts, a black version of the same boots he busted out for Game 1 of the Pacers series. The internet has declared Timmy something greater than White Boy of the Week. He’s approaching White Boy of a Generation. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Of course, Chalamet isn't merely popular online—his aura is palpable IRL, too. The point of wearing a fit like this is to be seen by as many people as possible, and on Thursday, that included his regular seat mate Ben Stiller. Chalamet and Stiller have become side-by-side fixtures during this Knicks playoff run. Beyond that, though, Chalamet had to say what up to the mayor of Madison Square Garden, and one of the few people in existence with a deeper collection of blue and orange swag than Timmy. We’re talking, of course, about Spike Lee, who is also one of a handful of people as dedicated to New York basketball as the 29-year-old actor. Spike and Timmy had plenty to celebrate on Thursday night. The MSG tour didn’t stop there, though. Chalamet linked up with two serious Knicks legends: one from the franchise’s 1970s championship years, and another from its last bout of relevancy in the early 2010s. Forget Jalen Brunson, Karl-Anthony Towns, and Mikal Bridges. The new big three is Timothée Chalamet, Walt “Clyde” Frazier, and J.R. Smith. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Thankfully for Chalamet—who we have to assume will be front and center for Saturday’s Game 6 in Indianapolis as well—his Knicks rallied for an emphatic 111-94 win on Thursday night. There was clearly some good mojo in his outfit, and if Lisan Al-Gaib is a superstitious sports fan like the rest of us, maybe we see this jacket again. Because what’s really more important: your team making the NBA Finals, or being accused of outfit repeating? With a win like that, which keeps the Knicks dream season going into the weekend, everyone was in good spirits. That includesChalamet’s girlfriend and front-row companion Kylie Jenner, who had a good sense of humor (and an A1 reference) about the whole thing. After the game, Jenner reposted a TikTok ofSex and the City’s Samantha Jones saying she only gets laid if the Knicks win. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Now that Game 6 is guaranteed, the Knicks have officially progressed as deep into the playoffs as they have in 25 years, when they lost to these same Indiana Pacers in Game 6 of the 2000 Conference Finals. Every game the Knicks play now is life or death, and while we never know what the basketball gods might have in store, we know Chalamet’s Chrome Heart will be pounding through his chest.",

    "title": "The Benefits of Yerba Mate Tea, Which Is Like Coffee Without the Crash",
    "article_text": "We think of tea drinkers as pretty chill. No one’s getting hyped up on chamomile. But yerba mate drinkers are a different breed. Yerba mate tea is the pre-game drink of choice for many athletes, including soccer playersLuis Suárez and Leo Messiand NBA playerJohn Collins. Hugely popular in South America, Yerba mate, a bitter herbal tea, isbecoming more sought after in the States, in large part because of its health benefits. Here, registered dietitians and herbalists share six science-backed reasons why it’s worth sipping. “Mate,” as the tea is commonly called outside the US, “is the national drink of Paraguay,” saysAllison Birks, CDN, an herbalist and nutritionist. “It is widely consumed in South America as a daily beverage.” In South America, drinking yerba mate tea isa symbol of national identityand an important social practice. Typically, it’s a shared drink, passed around in a gourd with a special straw called a bombilla. But even if you sip yerba mate solo, you’re going to reap plenty of benefits. Below are the six biggest. Yerba mate has more caffeine than most other teas (roughly the same amount that’s in coffee) and it won’t lead to a crash when it wears off, the way coffee can. “Yerba mate is notorious for having a smoother downtick of a caffeine ‘high,’ which is likely because of the slower release of caffeine or the other bioactive components, like theobromine,” says registered dietitianPaul Jaeckel, RD. Theobromine—the bioactive compound Jaeckel calls out—is what gives yerba mate tea its bitter flavor and is used to make caffeine, but Birks says that you won’t find it in coffee. Yerba mate also contains another compound that coffee does not: theophylline. “Theobromineimproves mood, alertness, and may be neuroprotective. Theophylline is known to promote a calm, relaxed yet focused state of mind,” Birks says. She adds that this unique composition may be why yerba mate tea is stimulating but doesn’t cause jitteriness. This combination of calm and focus may also be why some athletes like to drink yerba mate tea before games. Michael Dubanewicz, DHA, EdD, CCN,a culinary nutritionist and lifestyle medicine counselor, says that another one of the main benefits of yerba mate tea is its high antioxidant and polyphenol content, which helps lower inflammation in the body. He explains that there is a specific type of polyphenol in yerba mate tea (chlorogenic acids, or CGAs) which has been scientifically shown to reduce inflammation and protect against age-related disorders. All three experts say that drinking yerba mate tea regularlycan help lower the risk of many chronic conditions, including some forms of cancer. If you have achy joints, regularly drinking yerba mate tea could improve your symptoms. While Birks says that human studies still need to be done to prove the connection,there is scientific evidencethat the tea is effective in improving arthritis symptoms in rats. Birks says that this is because of the tea’s anti-inflammatory properties—especially those CGAs. Birks and Dr. Dubanewicz both add that yerba mate tea also contains a natural compound calledsaponins, which have also been found to decrease inflammation in the body. All three experts say that regularly drinking yerba mate tea supports short-term and long-term brain health. Regarding the short-term, Jaeckel says, “The theobromine and theophylline in yerba mate both have stimulating effects on the brain, which can help people focus and get their work done. The caffeine also affects hormones like dopamine in a way that makes the person feel happier.” As for the long-term benefits, Dr. Dubanewicz says that the polyphenols in yerba mate tea areneuroprotective, meaning that they help preserve the function of neurons in the brain.This helps lower the risk of neurodegenerative diseasessuch as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. “Research is showing that the compounds in yerba mate tea not only reduce inflammation, but alsoreduce plaque from building up in the brain, which is what leads to dementia,” Dr. Dubanewicz says. While yerba mate tea doesn’t work like Ozempic, it does have something in common with the GLP-1 medication: appetite suppression. Dr. Dubanewicz points toscientific researchshowing that yerba mate helps reduce hunger as well as fat buildup and inflammation, which both contribute to obesity. While he emphasizes that this doesn’t mean that drinking yerba mate tea will outweigh having an unhealthy diet, it means the tea can play a supporting role in losing weight in a healthy way. There are a few different ways that drinking yerba mate tea supports heart health. Dr. Dubanewicz and Jaeckel say that itlowers LDL cholesterol, which is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. This, Jaeckel explains, is credited to the tea’s high amount of antioxidants. “Yerba mate also contains minerals like potassium and magnesium, which are essential for maintaining healthy blood pressure,” says Dr. Dubanewicz. If you want to make yerba mate tea the way it’s traditionally consumed in South America, you need a gourd and bombilla (the special straw). There are lots ofsets for sale on Amazon, which can be washed and reused every time you’re craving some mate. Once you have your gourd and bombilla, Jaeckel says to fill the gourd up halfway with the loose leaf yerba mate. Then, tilt the gourd roughly 45 degrees to get all the leaves on one side. Pour hot water into the open gap, letting the tea steep for a couple of minutes. Once it’s steeped and ready, add your bombilla, making sure the bottom is under all the leaves. “The key technique here, just like all tea-making methods, is to not use boiling water but simmering, around 170°F, so you don’t ‘burn’ the leaves and have them become [too] bitter,” Dr. Dubanewicz says. While most people can benefit from yerba mate tea, it’s not for everyone. The caffeine can speed up your heart rate, so Birks says that if you have a heart condition, you should check with your doctor before drinking it. She says it’s also not recommended for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, so be mindful of who you offer it to. Otherwise, yerba mate tea is yours to enjoy. And while you’re at it, offer some to a friend. After all, this drink is meant to be shared.",

    "title": "The Nike Kobe 6 Protro ‘Dodgers’ Is a Love Letter to Los Angeles",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Like it or not, Los Angeles is one of America’s great sports cities. There have been six titles won by five LA teams (Rams, Dodgers, Lakers, LAFC, Galaxy) this decade alone. And yet, if you drive around town and look at the murals adorning all the gas stations and strip malls, you might think this was a one-team town that happened to have tremendous affection for one basketball player. That one team is theDodgersand that one player isKobe Bryant. I’m not from Los Angeles, but it’s home to me now, and I love it dearly. The easiest way for me to explain why is to take you to a Dodgers game. I’ve lived in a few different cities over the years, some with great sports cultures, but believe me when I say I have never seen a place that loves a team the way LA loves the Dodgers. Go to the stadium—baseball’s Vatican City, even if Soldier Field is technically the home of the Pope these days—and see for yourself. Crowds show up for weekday matinees in the summer the wayKnicks fansare right now for the Conference Finals. Every summer, the Dodgers honor the late, great Bryant with Kobe Night, the only Los Angeles sports figure who rivals the city’s affection for them, and every summer it’s one of the biggest tickets in a town full of big tickets. The Mamba was a mainstay at Dodgers games during his time in the city—these days, you can throw a rock in this town and you’ll hit someone wearing a tee shirt with a picture of Kobe in full Dodgers regalia on it. Forget Magic and Shaq and Gretzky and Beckham and Kareem and LeBron. There’s Kobe and there’s the Dodgers. In a city of champions, everyone else is fighting for second place. Nike has draped plenty of kicks in Dodger blue over the years, from local favoritesCortezesto a pair of LeBron 7s back in 2021. But they’ve never decked out a pair of Kobes in the colors of his favorite baseball team until this week. In collaboration with the Bryant family, the Swoosh is finally dropping a pair of Kobes—the 6, his most popular silhouette—in Dodger blue for $180. Complete with white accents, the shoes also features red stitching across the tongue mimicking that of a baseball’s seams. Peep the outer heel and you’ll spot Kobe’s number 8 in the same style all Dodgers players wear on their uniforms. Dropping alongside the sneakers is a full array of baseball gear, from batting gloves to an $800 catcher set in Dodger blue and emblazoned with Kobe’s sheath logo (if you really want to lean into it, local icons Born X Raised are dropping their new Dodgers World Series collection on the same day). It’s a good time for these shoes. LA is at once thriving and nursing its wounds. On one hand,Kendrickput the city on his back last year and just celebrated with tens of thousands of fans at SoFi Stadium last week. The Dodgers and the LA Galaxy both won titles at the end of last year.Luka’s on the Lakers. The West Coast is up, sure—but 2025 got off to a rough start when the LA wildfires ravaged the city, leaving thousands of Angelenos without their homes and without any idea what comes next. We’re still rebuilding, and we’re going to be okay, but the road to get there is long. It’s silly to say a pair of sneakers can remind you of this, but there are few things that bring the city together like Kobe and the Dodgers. We stay filling that stadium up, and there’s still no better place to be on a hot summer night in Los Angeles than the Chavez Ravine. The Nike Kobe 6 ‘Dodgers’ collection isavailable today via SNKRS.",

    "title": "The Best Wes Anderson Movies, Definitively Ranked",
    "article_text": "The bestWes Andersonmovies—which is to say, pretty much all of them—prompt visual recognition so immediate that both his detractors and some of his biggest fans miss what’s going on behind their meticulous design. As easy as it is to superficially parody, Anderson’s signature is not simply a matter of elaborate side-tracking shots, camera-facing introductory portraits of the actors, switched-up aspect ratios, and a deadpan-presentational style. They’re more about the net effect of his rebuilding our world as a deceptively sophisticated storybook, which he uses to explore the complexities of family, performance, making art, mortality, and even the actual meaning of life. Given what they must demand of the various craftspeople who work on them, though, it wouldn’t be a surprise if we had to wait five to seven years for a new Anderson film. Instead he’s been surprisingly prolific—The Phoenician Schemeis premiering just about two years afterAsteroid City, which trailedThe French Dispatchby only 18 months or so—and therefore easier to take for granted. Maybe it’s churlish to expect more acclaim for a filmmaker who, to this point, has enjoyed what looks like enviable creative freedom and a following dedicated enough for him to maintain it. Anderson is one of the few style-forward directors to emerge in the late ‘90s and weather the turn away from indie aesthetics, the decline of grown-up movies, and all the other stuff that can make the multiplex a wasteland for weeks at a time. If even the best Wes Anderson movies aren’t for everyone, well, isn’t that encouraging in the wake of inflated Tomatometer scores, cinematic poptimism, and influencer-booster culture? It’s better, then, that he’s able to work with such relative quickness, since it means we get as many of these movies as possible while we can. With that in mind, here are all of his feature films so far, ranked from delightful to masterful. Here’s a weird little confession from me, someone who absolutely reveres the films of Wes Anderson: I don’t think he reaches his finest, truest form as a director of stop-motion animation. The detail-oriented, ultra-bespoke, handmade care that goes into stop-motion certainly seems compatible with his sensibilities; his movies often resemble dioramas, the reasoning goes, so better to simply lean into it on projects where he can literally be in charge of every tiny movement, every bristle of fake fur, every tiny button on every tiny, tailored jacket. The thing is, though, Anderson is almost certainly not on the set of a stop-motion wonder likeIsle of Dogsevery day, whereas he does presumably work with his live-action players quite directly throughout shooting. I’m not saying he needs to work in the stop-motion trenches in order to “really” direct these movies (and obviously he can be there for the voiceover recordings); just that for as much as he’s sometimes criticized for getting deadpan, emotion-drained performances from his actors (an untruth we’ll address later), those actors do bring their own personalities and physicalities to their work that a stop-motion dog cannot. Of course, Anderson’s stop-motion worlds are also stunningly beautiful, and his writing is wonderfully attuned to his animal characters’ balance between preconscious instinct and human frailty. These might be the most weirdlyaccurate-feeling talking animal movies ever conceived, andIsle of Dogsin particular brings Anderson into the world of science fiction in a fanciful way his live-action movies have never managed. It’s wonderful! It’s also, for a sci-fi adventure about a boy traveling to a garbage-strewn island to rescue his quarantined dog, a little pokey—and those who, in 2018, questioned Anderson’s positioning of a white American girl (voiced by Greta Gerwig!) as the Japan-set film’s human heroine, well… they had a point. There’s a certain contingent of Anderson originalists who will tell you that he should really make something loose and unfussy likeBottle Rocketagain; they may also try to sell you the bizarre lie that nothing was ever the same afterOwen Wilsonstopped co-writing movies with Anderson. (Due respect to Wilson, a singular presence and comic voice, but how does one conclude that the star ofDrillbit Taylor—who never really stopped collaborating with his buddy anyway—is a more vital screenwriter than, say, Noah Baumbach?) This fetishistic Debut Album Syndrome should not detract from the fact thatBottle Rocket is, indeed, a striking and often hilarious debut that inadvertently bridges one kind of ‘90s indie—the colorful,Reservoir Dogs-y crime thriller—and quite another, that we’d now call the ersatz Wes Anderson movie but at the time seemed like a sweetly quirky character study. There’s more than a little Huck Finn/Tom Sawyer dynamic at play when Dignan (Owen Wilson) breaks his pal Anthony (Luke Wilson) out of a psychiatric hospital (which he's checked himself in voluntarily) and eagerly shows him his 75-year plan for their life of crime; unlike so many arch post-Tarantino crime comedies (the trendiness of which probably helped sell this one to Sony),Bottle Rocketunderstands these capers as the actions of lost boys, not aspirational badasses. It’s a little slower-paced and less emotionally striking than Anderson’s later, more elaborate work, but for most other filmmakers it would be an unambiguous top-five movie. If you don’t recall Wes Anderson releasing a feature film in 2024, that’s because it happened on Netflix, where even Oscar-winners get lost in the shuffle. The streamer, as part of its partnership with Roald Dahl’s estate, financed a series of short-film adaptations of more grown-up Dahl stories from Anderson, who had previously adapted the author’sFantastic Mr. Fox. Longest entry “The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar,” from the story collection of the same name (augmented withAnd Six More), went first, with a small theatrical release; three more quickly followed on Netflix only. “Henry Sugar,” benefitting from its marquee stars (Benedict Cumberbatch;Dev Patel;Ralph Fiennes) and filmmaker (as well as the frequently poor competition in this category), won the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short of 2023, as seemed to be Netflix’s plan. Subsequently, they repackaged the four films as a single anthology —which, given that it adds up to 88 minutes, feels like the original intent to begin with, although, hey, Netflix got Anderson his Oscar, so that’s out of the way, at least. No matter how you slice it, this is a terrific Dahl adaptation, exceeded only by Anderson’s own previous Dahl movie. All four segments are produced with a beguiling hybrid of pure-cinema trickery and old-fashioned stagecraft, as actors deliver narration and perform in-camera scene transitions, a fascinating variation on the idea that Anderson’s movies are “just” well-crafted dioramas populated by stars from his ever-growing rep company. Here, a rep company within the rep company, reappearing across multiple segments, obliterates the lines between precise directorial arrangement, the prose that provides their cues, and more traditional modes of performance. It’s a series of balancing acts, and if watching multiple Anderson features in this style might be exhausting, a collection of shorts ends up being a fascinating way for the filmmaker to make his way through the thorniness of the brilliant but prejudiced Dahl, who Fiennes also plays. So much Dahl material emphasizes the good feelings his children’s books ultimately give to their young readers;Henry Sugarcaptures the darker impulses alongside that sense of play. Anderson is about the last prestige filmmaker anyone would expect to rip anything from the headlines, at least not headlines sourced from still-extant publications. YetThe Phoenician Schemefollows a wealthy man who lives in ridiculous opulence, may actually be cash poor, operates with the reckless bravado and self-interest of a self-styled dealmaker, and uses frivolous lawsuits as a major weapon to vanquish his enemies. He spends much of the movie pursuing a labyrinthine, interconnected development project in the fictionalized Middle Eastern country of Phoenicia that entails cajoling various other parties into paying more money, with the help of the daughter he has chosen as a favored heir. Does any of this sound familiar? Yet Zsa Zsa Korda (Benicio del Toro) is not a misguided attempt to make a whimsically likable rascal out of Donald Trump’s moral crimes, nor is Lisel (Mia Threapleton) precisely an Ivanka stand-in. He’s a caricature of an industrialist that becomes further softened and shaded as he grapples with the stark realities of death—cleverly and ironically portrayed through a series of black-and-white tableaux visions, arranged in Anderson’s customary fantastical-yet-stagy style.The Phoenician Schemelacks the ensemble heft of Anderson’s best work (the bit parts are even bittier than usual) as well as the layered ingenuity of his layered later-period storytelling, but its mix of reality (a rich man who sometimes feels indestructible and therefore above any particular moral code) and fantasy (a rich man who may learn how to build things other than deals and bank accounts) is as potent as ever. Unlike Trump, Anderson knows his way around strong infrastructure, and the flawed humanity it supports. It’s arguable thatHenry Sugaris even more successful as a Dahl adaptation thanFantastic Mr. Fox, which expands so much on its slim source material that it can’t help but feel equally akin to other Anderson movies. In that sense, there are pieces ofFoxthat retread better material: George Clooney’s self-centered patriarch feels like a fuzzier version of Royal Tenenbaum, Meryl Streep is essentially doing an Anjelica Huston impression as the spouse whose loyalty he tests, and seething little Ash (Jason Schwartzman) is sort of a less confident Max Fischer, with some Noah Baumbach-style familial testiness added in. But while I can’t get on board with anyone calling this Anderson’s best movie, it is an undeniably hilarious and eye-filling animated comedy, with gorgeously autumnal stop-motion animation matching the deadpan melancholy of the voiceover performances. So many talking-animal cartoons use the magic of the medium to enable weapons-grade yammering, so what a delight to watch a family-appropriate cartoon where the dialogue, even or especially at its silliest (“You cussin’ with me?”) is one its chief pleasures. Perhaps Anderson’s most-maligned film (and neck-and-neck with #6 on this list as his most undervalued); a logistically ambitious and (given the sprawling ensembles he employed before and after) dramatically slimmed-down story of three brothers (Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody, Jason Schwartzman) attempting to reconnect on a train trip through India. Two of the three brothers aren’t trying very hard: Peter (Brody, in perhaps his best performance!) and Jack (Schwartzman) repeatedly plot to ditch the trip, while Francis (Wilson) tries so hard that his sentimentalized domineering only exacerbates his siblings’ simmering irritation. Eventually, though, the boy-men must let go of their baggage—literally, inone scene that’s dismayingly on-the-nose but still Kinks-scored enough to offer an emotional hit—and learn to appreciate the unshakeable, intense, and sometimes maddening bond that comes from their status as siblings. Amusingly, this sometimes involves uniting them as Ugly Americans, as when, after getting kicked off their initial train following a raucous scrap, they petulantly throw rocks at the vehicle as it pulls away from them; after that point, it should be impossible to pretend Anderson isn’t aware of the optics of three white Americans heading to India in search of spiritual enlightenment (not least because two-thirds of them seem actively hostile to the other’s attempt to be present). The sheer technical virtuosity required to stage so many scenes in cramped train cars also gives lie to the idea that Anderson is a one-trick pony, stylistically speaking, and a late flashback scene to the day of the characters’ father’s funeral speaks to his short-story precision as a writer. In short, what is sometimes described as just more of Anderson’s twee bullshit is actually a complex vehicle for him to try out a lot of new stuff that only looks familiar. This meansThe Darjeeling Limitedis also pioneering in the field of Anderson being underestimated. The perfect hit of nostalgia and lamentation for the era of publishing layoffs, Anderson’s other anthology-ish film offers a flip through the final issue of a magazine published out of a French news bureau of a midwestern American newspaper: three feature stories, plus a guided tour of the city Ennui-sur-Blasé and an obituary for Arthur Howitzer Jr. (Bill Murray), the recently deceased publisher. Shot pre-COVID but released post-reopening, it really felt in 2021 as if Anderson was making up for cinema’s absence by cramming in as many stories, characters, actors, and sight gags into one feature as possible—an act of (perhaps imagined) generosity that’s difficult to forget even years later. Some didn’t care for the seeming dismissiveness with which the middle story treats a band of young French revolutionaries led byTimothée Chalamet, but getting fussed over that might require overlooking the no-fuss collectivism that closes the movie, as the staff of the magazine sits in their former boss’s office, mourning but urging themselves on, taking solace in the quiet collaboration of an artform often assumed to be solitary: “Let’s write it together.” It was our mistake, really, thinking Bill Murray was cuddly. Yes, he’s played the sarcastic curmudgeon who comes around to accept goodness (inScroogedand, better,Groundhog Day) and/or saves the world (inGhostbusters). But the “real” Murray—brilliant, mercurial, cutting, arrogant, borderline impossible—probably looks more like Steve Zissou, the character inThe Life Aquaticwho, based on Murray’s then-recent turns for the soulfully melancholy, was probably assumed pre-release to lead another chronicle of Bill rediscovering his humanity. And that is kinda, sorta what happens in Anderson’s first collaboration with Noah Baumbach, but boy is Zissou an audience-alienating bastard at times, retroactively explaining further how richly Gene Hackman deserved an Oscar for his own take on Anderson’s lovable-rascal father figure. That’s not to say Murray isn’t also terrific inThe Life Aquatic; it’s actually one of his best performances, in a movie that once again finds Anderson sailing off into new territory, even as the set design remains as intricately whimsical as ever. Fitting, too, that some of the film’s stylistic experiments—action-movie violence shot with a handheld camera, for one thing—are in service of a narrative that’s explicitly about the quixotic indulgences of filmmaking. Many of Anderson’s cheerfully elaborate productions could be read that way; what’s particularly funny aboutLife Aquaticis the way the movie-within-a-movie’s leader Zissou often plainly has no idea what exactly he’s doing. It’s an approach that can make you look like a genius when you’re young and lucky, and like a neglectful monster when you’re older and prone to missing a step. In another one of Anderson’s masterful single-line sum-ups, Murray sums up the confrontation of mortality by staring at the beautiful creature that killed his friend and asks, “Do you think he remembers me?” (Also, in case that sounds too treacly: Murray screaming clarifications about how, precisely, his friend Esteban was killed by that shark—“He was swallowed whole?” “NO! CHEWED!”—is probably among the three or four hardest laughs I’ve ever had in a movie theater.) Is there significance in the fact that starting withMoonrise Kingdom, Wes Anderson traveled back in time and has yet to return to the present day for longer than a few moments ofGrand Budapest Hotel’s framing sequences? Before this self-consciously YA-ish story of barely-adolescent runaways, set mostly in 1965, all of Anderson’s movies were actually located in the more-or-less now. (He may seem like a forever-vinyl guy, but there’s an iPod in “Hotel Chevalier,” the short prelude toThe Darjeeling Limited!) Post-Moonrise, most of them are oriented closer to the middle of the 20th century. It’s a trend that unites a number of our best-regarded filmmakers; in the 21st century,Scorsese,Spielberg, theCoen Brothers, andPaul Thomas Andersonhave collectively made about eight films with significant material set in the “present,” none more recent than 2008. This is to say that Anderson’s time-warped worlds actually have more portals to the modern world than a lot of his fellow geniuses; and also that, sure, he indulges certain proclivities by removing himself further from whatever passes for the present in his work. That’s not a criticism;Moonrise Kingdomhas an untouched loveliness, further set off from civilization through its (fictional) New England island location. Anyway, Suzy (Kara Hayward) and Sam (Jared Gilman) need some technological impediments separating them, idealizing them, until they reunite when Sam attends scout camp on Suzy’s home island, and agree to run away together—at which point they need a lack of tech to blissfully, albeit briefly, isolate them from the rest of the world. Until a perhaps slightly too-antic climax,Moonriseis one of Anderson’s sweetest, gentlest movies, very nearly appropriate for the age group it depicts. (A dog still dies, though.) It’s also one of his most touching portrayals of masculinity, withEdward Nortonjoining the ensemble as an earnest scoutmaster andBruce Willisgiving a performance on par with his non-action ‘90s best as a no-nonsense but sensitive island policeman. If it’s notBottle Rocket, it’sRushmore, am I right? In other words, it’s the Wes Anderson movie, safely co-written with Owen Wilson, that supposedly retains a bit of spontaneity and life that he drains from his later, more formalized forays into nested dollhouses, blah blah blah. But how about this:Rushmoreis itself about realizing the incompleteness of its own central perspective. That’s not to say Anderson is as lacking in worldly knowledge as Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), the wannabe-prodigy whose private-school-funded ambition frequently outshines his brilliance. (Is it condescending or winking self-admission that artists in Anderson’s movies are often derivative or, in the words of a famous narrator, “fail to develop as a painter”?) But for the movie to feel this fresh and vital, it maybe has to be have a bit of Max in it, even if Anderson balances out that impetuousness with the morally defeated businessman Herman Blume (Bill Murray) who is revitalized by his friendship with Max and, perhaps moreso, his shared crush on Rushmore Academy teacher Miss Cross (Olivia Williams). Maybe I’m bullshitting a little bit here, becauseRushmoreis a masterpiece; I just love the three other masterpieces ranked above it here even more. It might appear to the naked eye and/or brain that Anderson treats his expanding collection of A-listers and character actors as just that: a collection to be placed under glass, costumed and arranged just so. But I’m more convinced than ever that he understands both star presence and acting better than many of his contemporaries. InAsteroid City, he offers certain performers a dizzying array of roles within roles; at one point, Scarlett Johansson, a famous actress, is playing a famous actress hesitating to appear in a play where she will play a famous actress evoking another famous actress, while Jason Schwartzman plays her love interest in a movie-within-the-play-within-the-TV-show-within-the-movie, and then steps out of that production so he can play the actor playing that part, reciting cut lines opposite another actress (Margot Robbie) who only appears in that one scene, save for a cameo in a photograph. Like I said: dizzying. But it’s also such a heartfelt tribute to the yearning, searching quality of acting that it should have made the Academy blush with delight. It’s not a surprise that some reacted more like Schwartzman’s actor, who stops the scene to admit to the director-within-the-etc. that he’s not sure if he’s doing it right: “I still don’t understand the play.” Johansson, meanwhile, both parodies her own glamour and openly discusses the dysfunctional mystique that comes along with Marilyn Monroe-type figures, wondering what kind of person it makes her in the real world. This, in other words, is a film fixated on the creation of illusion, and the search for meaning within those illusions, whether in art or life. In a miracle that Anderson appears to naturally intuit, all of this nested information in no way detracts from the emotional (or comedic) core ofAsteroid City, which is about a group of characters converging on a barely-there desert town and getting quarantined after an alien sighting. We are simultaneously watching ScarJo, Schwartzman, Tom Hanks, Steve Carell, Maya Hawke,Jeffrey Wright, and a host of others inhabit Anderson’s world and ours, as they breathe the rarified air of real and fictional movie stars. A lot of artists grapple with the question of why anyone makes art in the first place;Asteroid Citydares turn that question into a cosmic one without sacrificing any of its surface aesthetic charm. Once again, a film received by many as Just Another Wes Anderson Movie is actually a towering and singular achievement that many would spend many years fruitlessly attempting to top. Ralph Fiennes’ turn to deliver a career-best performance under Anderson’s watchful eye, as Gustave H., the concierge of a mountainside hotel in a fictional European country on the brink of fascist control during an alternate version of World War II. Maybe it was the latter angle that helpedGrand Budapestalong to somewhat surprising Oscar success; it was nominated for nine Academy Awards and won four (makeup, costumes, production design, and score; the most of any other 2014 movie, including Best Picture winnerBirdman). You hate to hand it to the Academy, but the film’s vision of encroaching fascism does lendGrand Budapesta thematic and emotional heft unlike other Anderson movies, which Anderson then brilliantly counterbalances by making much of the movie a rollicking, screwball-ish caper. The violence that lurks at the edges, allowed to stay just this side of comic in off-camera prison fight scenes and cruel cat murder, later becomes more matter-of-fact in the film’s narration, where a lifetime of devastation for young Zero (Tony Revolori) exists outside the beauty of pink-boxed sweets and purple-suited opulence. These stories, by turns hilarious and wistful and deeply sad, echo through the movie’s multiple framing devices, as succinct a portrait of tragedy turning into history as I’ve ever seen in film. I’m not capable of feigning film-critic objectivity aboutThe Royal Tenenbaums, so even though this might bePulp FictiontoThe Grand Budapest Hotel’sInglourious Basterds(that is, the more influential, template-setting artist’s statement that will probably always remain a signature title with perhaps a touch of dorm-poster obviousness, versus the more ambitious, historically aware, Europe-set hit that may actually be the better, weightier film), I can’t imagine ranking another Anderson movie higher. A spiritual sequel toRushmoreand, perhaps, a spiritual prequel to parts ofAsteroid CityandThe Life Aquatic, the film simply follows the return home of child-prodigy siblings Richie (Luke Wilson), Chas (Ben Stiller), and Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), as they reunite with their mother Etheline (Anjelica Huston) and learn of the supposed illness that has befallen their rascally and neglectful father Royal (Gene Hackman), who is, of course, faking it. Reconnecting with a flawed father is such a hoary indie plot that it’s genuinely shocking how much feeling Andreson wrings from this scenario, with each of Royal’s adult children trapped in a kind of precocious stasis; remarkably, despite the performances pitched in a congruent same-family register, Wilson, Stiller, and Paltrow all give, yes, career-best performances. Even the legendary Gene Hackman—especiallythe legendary Gene Hackman! —has the opportunity to deliver a perfectly judged performance, serving as his true career capstone,Welcome to Mooseportnotwithstanding. Also likePulp Fiction(and, uh, not so much likeMooseport),The Royal Tenenbaumsis the writer-director’s funniest movie in a walk, wall to wall with laugh-out-loud-in-context lines (“I’m sorry for your loss. Your mother was a terribly attractive woman.”) and exchanges (“I’m not colorblind, am I?” “I’m afraid you are.”). They’re the perfect ongoing warm-up for Anderson’s patented single-line devastation, here delivered by Stiller’s Chas, the angriest and perhaps most recently wounded of the Tenenbaum siblings. It’s always eye-rolling when clumsy parodists try to “do” Wes Anderson by essentially just copying the Alec Baldwin narration, the library-book framing, and the fonts ofThe Royal Tenenbaums. But it makes sense, too: When faced with a movie this wonderful, what else is there to do with it?",

    "title": "‘The Phoenician Scheme’ Is A Wes Anderson Movie About A Reckless Rich Guy Making Big Beautiful Deals",
    "article_text": "Wes Andersonis just about the last prestige filmmaker anyone would expect to rip anything from the headlines, at least not headlines sourced from still-extant publications. Like so many of the best American directors, he’s gone years without making a movie set in the recognizable here and now, something he last did with 2007’sThe Darjeeling Limited. (Granted, 2018’sIsle of Dogswas set in a stop-motion dystopian future.) In fact, his new filmThe Phoenician Schemetakes place even deeper into the past than usual—precisely midcentury, in 1950. (OnlyThe Grand Budapest Hotelreaches further back.) That said,The Phoenician Schemealso follows a wealthy man who lives in ridiculous opulence, may actually be cash-poor, operates with the reckless bravado and self-interest of a self-styled dealmaker, and uses frivolous lawsuits as a major weapon to vanquish his enemies. He spends much of the movie pursuing a labyrinthine, interconnected development project in the fictionalized Middle Eastern country of Phoenicia that entails cajoling various other parties into paying more money following a series of vengeful tariff increases. Anderson has said that he did not really write this movie thinking of Donald Trump, and I believe him. The film is dedicated to his late father-in-law, who apparently inspired the central character, a detail that makes sense; Zsa Zsa Korda (Benicio del Toro) is selfish and careless, but he is drawn with affection. He’s a caricature, but not a grotesque, nor a vulgarian, nor an idiot. He’s the kind of industrialist figure someone like Trump might mindlessly imitate, oblivious (or aspiring) to the emptiness at the center of his role model’s endless wheeling and dealing. Yet whether or not Trump ever entered Anderson’s mind during the writing or filmmaking process—which took place during the Biden years—it’s hard to avoid how long this man has been the center of national attention, seeping into our consciousness. Like Trump, Zsa Zsa doesn’t particularly articulate the purpose or full dimension of this supposed life’s-work project, which is thrown into potential disaster by a sudden increase in the price of bolts. The important thing about Zsa Zsa’s scheme is that it is vast and it is his, not unlike the director’s intricately-designed parallel worlds, and the movie spends a compressed period of time with Zsa Zsa and his estranged only daughter Liesl (Mia Threapleton) as he attempts to set this project right for his potential heir. He speaks of a massive work that will resonate (and generate income for) a century and a half, or more, if everyone will just get out of the way and surrender to his whims. Welcome to Wes Anderson’s Infrastructure Week. Despite these strange parallels to our world,The Phoenician Schemewill strike some as just another Wes Anderson picture, as so many of his pictures do for a certain segment of the audience. We have again a selfish, absent, and unaffectionate father with big projects beyond his children (in the style of Royal Tenenbaum, Steve Zissou, and the fantastic Mr. Fox), a child whose exact parentage raises certain questions (like Margot Tenenbaum or Steve Zissou’s maybe-son Ned Plimpton), unruly supporting children shooting arrows (like inMoonrise Kingdom), and a daisy chain of Anderson regulars in walk-on roles as various eccentrics (like in most of his recent films, especiallyAsteroid City), among other signatures. But as recognizable as his work remains, Anderson also experiments compulsively within that framework. Here there are striking overhead shots, occasional jump cuts, a couple of whirling POV shots when characters attack each other with particular brio, and black-and-white sequences where Zsa Zsa has dreamlike visions of an afterlife, fueling his desire to pass his projects off to Liesl before one of many assassination attempts succeeds. Though the afterlife sequences feature Anderson regulars dressed in outlandish costumes—Bill Murrayplays God, naturally—they’re not really comic bits, instead speaking to the ticking clock affixed to this amoral man’s life. Zsa Zsa is not a spiritual man; Liesl has been preparing to become a nun, and it’s a calling from which Zsa Zsa seeks to retrieve her, at one point replacing her genuine rosary with a gaudy “secular” version. Clearly there’s only room for one godlike overseer here. Yet we sense that Zsa Zsa’s tendencies toward the vainglorious, while not quite touched with religious grace nor an artist’s sensibility, are maybe his version of the spiritual—building temples to himself. The black-and-white glimpses of the beyond shake him up, however subtly, because they don’t conform to his self-image. As with so many Anderson protagonists, he’s getting a glimpse of things beyond his control. Increasingly this involves some higher cosmic order that they can’t quite get their arms around. It would be possible to mistake the movie’s relentless forward momentum for simply running in place. Though the various characters’ involvement in Zsa Zsa’s project shift over the course of the movie, the structure is repetitive; it literally involves crossing the same basic item—get these other groups of people to agree to pay more—off of a single on-screen list. The repetition becomes part of the joke, as multiple parties accuse Zsa Zsa of “fiddling” with their agreements. In classic mogul mode, he admits nothing until it behooves him to admit it, and then pretends as if the lie was never a big deal. So yes, it’s difficult not to think of Trump duringThe Phoenician Scheme, and that may be a deal too far for some of his audience. The idea of humanizing a monstrous wannabe dictator with Andersonian whimsy might especially repulse those wondering if his trademark fastidiousness and fondness for past eras lost to time might conceal a kind of moneyed conservatism. Liesl, for all of her religious humility, gradually opens up to some of her father’s more indulgent pleasures, particularly alcohol. Bjørn Lund, the tutor/sidekick played by Michael Cera, also hides a more staid secret with his effete intellectualism. But if Anderson is more apt to rib the chaos of revolutionaries than join calls for the guillotine, he also has a knack for finding that grace in other sudden turns of fate. (I would say thatThe Phoenician Schemeis more violent than the typical Anderson project, but the same could also be said forThe Life AquaticorThe Grand Budapest Hotel.) Trump is a self-caricature who only grows uglier and more venal with the passage of time; Anderson’s caricatures soften and shade by tiny increments. For all of its funny screwball antics, like disputes solved with an extended basketball contest or a marriage of convenience,The Phoenician Schememakes its way to another Anderson trademark: an ending whose quiet emotional fullness sneaks up on you. Some have compared Anderson’s movies to dollhouses or contraptions. But the fussy imposition of will is ultimately not the point. The building is.",

    "title": "These Watches Will Define the Summer, According to the Watch Illuminati",
    "article_text": "This is an edition of the newsletterBox + Papers,Cam Wolf’s weekly deep dive into the world of watches.Sign up here. Thesummer watch is an indispensable piece in every collector’s toolbox. This is a timepiece that comes out of hibernation for the summer months because few others are up for the task. The summer watch must be fun and colorful but also durable and hard-wearing. Even better if you’re fun-loving summer watch is friendly with chlorine, saltwater, and maybe even a dive. This rugged, indestructible watch should also be airy and light to wear. Maybe it’s titanium or comes on a rubber strap. And even after it covers all that ground, it would be best if it came with a vacation-ready complication, like a GMT or Worldtimer. The Summer Watch works hard so you can take it easy. Personally, during the early days of summer, I’ve found I can’t get the Undefeated x G-Shock DWE5600UD off my wrist. It’s the ideal companion for these more active months, when I need a watch that’s indestructible yet surprisingly featherweight and airy. The watch comes with three different bands, and I immediately put mine on the beige-brown-and-cream “storm camouflage.” The pattern feels especially summery thanks to its semi-translucent quality, which makes the whole thing feel even lighter. Butmyperfect summer watch isn’t necessarily right for everyone. Which is why I asked a few members of the Watch Illuminati to weigh in on the timepieces they think will define the summer of 2025. Every year, Rolex releases a watch that becomes conversation fodder for the next 12 months. One year,it’s a “Sprite” GMT for lefties, the nextit’s the infamous “Puzzle Dial” that replacesthe days of the month with a set of bespoke emoji. And for 2025, the Rolexes stirring up the most chatter are the trio of pastel Oyster Perpetuals that were announced in April. “Hard to go against the new color palette of the Rolex OPs,” Golden said. Rolex put out a trio of matte dials in a beautiful array of summery tones: pistachio, lavender, and beige. “They dropped some lovely new pastel colors right in time for summer, where everything is supposed to be a little bright and sunnier, a little less formal, a bit more fun,” Golden continued. “And when you look at those colors, the first thing that comes to my mind is ‘fun in the sun.’” Golden’s favorite is the lavender. Summer means travel. It means cannonballing into a rooftop pool at your friend’s apartment building around the corner one day, diving into the ocean off the coast of Bali the next, and then relaxing at a lakeside cabin somewhere in Scandinavia the morning after that. Which is why Smith’s choice, the Nomos Club Sport Neomatik Worldtimer, is so perfect. The watch’s Worldtimer complication will keep you on track for wherever in the world the season takes you. “It checks all the boxes with funky colors and the summer-vacation-appropriate complication,” Smith said. Not to mention that earlier this year, Nomos released the watch in a handful of bright, dreamy color combinations like “Jungle,” “Volcano,” “Glacier,” and “Canyon.” The destinations are literally in the name. “The 40-mm case and fun dial combos command a striking presence and will look killer in a signature wrist shot somewhere soaking up the sun,” said Smith. @Dimepiece What could be more seasonally appropriate than a collection of watches described as “Joyful”? Hublot’s latest Big Bangs come in a range of colors only matched by your local sno-cone vendor. “If I were the type of person who summered on a super yacht, or a hot rich tennis player, my watch of the season would be these Hublots,” said Wallner. The pieces check every essential box on the summer-watch checklist. “I’m obsessed with this watch: the colors, the diamonds, the mechanical movement, the sporty rubber,” said Wallner. “People like to hate on Hublot but I think that’s lazy. To me, the flash is all part of the fun. I’d wear it with a knowing wink.” And the watch is uncharacteristically compact for Hublot, which is great for summer, when you don’t want to be lugging around something massive on your wrist. “It clocks in at 33 mm,” Wallner said, “so we’d call this a LITTLE Bang.” Amsterdam Vintage Watches In the ’70s, Rolex began issuing watches with special lacquer dials in an array of vivid colors. They became known among watch lovers as “Stella” dials, named for the company that provided them. Fifty years later, the bright pieces remain emblematic of summer in many collectors’ eyes. “This is usually my summer watch,” Abelson said of her Datejustwith an orange dial. “Coming out of a cold winter living in NYC, I want something bright with a pop of color. It’s an occasion watch in the winter, but my Stella dial goes with everything for every occasion in summer.” If you decide to follow in Abelson’s footsteps, you’ll have no shortage of options available to you. The Crown pumped out these Stella-dial Day-Dates and Datejust in a huge range of hues, including navy, turquoise, oxblood, cotton-candy pink, coral, cherry red, gold, mint, and hunter green. When the upstart watchmaker Vanguart launched in 2021, it skipped the typical newcomer brand tropes—value propositions, homage watches, hand-finished movements, novel shapes—in favor of simply making watches that could easily be mistaken for sci-fi movie gadgets. From Ben-Yehuda’s perspective, they might as well be watches sent from the future to ensure you have a perfect summer. “When I think of a summer watch, I’m not thinking quiet or understated—I’m thinking unapologetic,” said Ben-Yehuda. “Something bright, effortless. So for me, that’s the new Vanguart Orb in rose gold on a white (or sand-colored) strap.” Of course, when it comes to summer watches, what matters most is how they feel on your wrist—in terms of fit and weight—in the blaring humidity. “Watches can tend to feel uncomfortable in the heat, and this one doesn’t,” Ben-Yehuda said. “The Orb is shockingly ergonomic. It hugs the wrist in a way that makes you forget you’re even wearing it—until the light catches that single diamond and the whole dial comes to life.” And much like the other entries on this list, the Orb simply has that undefinable, you-know-it-when-you-see-it summer quality. “The peripheral rotor, in motion around the dial, gives it this kinetic energy that feels exactly right for summer—playful, dynamic, and just a little unexpected,” said Ben-Yehuda. “If I had to wear one watch this season, this would be it. No hesitation.” Sotheby's Sometimes you don’t need to overthink it. The best ice cream flavor on a blazing hot day? Vanilla is top tier. Best summer activity? Going to the beach. And when it comes to the Watch of the Summer? Well, why not one of the most iconic watches ever: the Rolex GMT-Master II “Pepsi” with a blue-and-red bezel. “The ‘Pepsi’ on a jubilee bracelet transcends the usual summer watch deliberations,” Williams said. Rolex’s renowned watch has all the attributes you want from a summer watch, according to Williams. The colorful bezel is perfect for sunny days. “Its red-and-blue bezel doesn’t just catch light, it transforms it, creating a dynamic play of colors that feels equally at home poolside or in the boardroom,” he said. Williams also specifies that for the summer, the GMT-Master is best on the pretty jubilee bracelet over the more classic oyster. “The jubilee bracelet adds a sophisticated fluidity that perfectly balances the sport and dress elements,” Williams. The GMT is really an all-season watch that really thrives in these warmer months, when you want some color and a piece you can wear any time and anywhere. “Like a perfectly tailored suit,” Williams said, “it elevates every moment without ever feeling like it’s trying.” See all of our newsletters, includingBox + Papers,here.",

    "title": "Recurring Wes Anderson Actors, Definitively Ranked",
    "article_text": "From the beginning of his career, casting has been one of Wes Anderson’s greatest strengths. The chance to join the Anderson repertory company has become a siren call no actor can resist—which is impressive, given that the director got his start by grabbing literally anyone he could find within a three block radius of the Dallas flop house he shared with similarly broke friends (including Owen Wilson, and occasionally his little brother Luke) to star in his short film about two Texas shitheels suffering from ennui who half heartedly take up a life of crime. When that short’s performance at Sundance caught the eyes of legendary producer/kingmakers Polly Platt and James L. Brooks, Anderson got the chance to remake it as a feature film—and somehow cajoled bona fide legend James Caan to come aboard for a few scenes as a low-rent crime boss who also runs a landscaping business. With each subsequent project, Anderson raised his game, the stakes, and the level of world-building in his films, and the sheer movie-star wattage of his casts has increased accordingly. He discovered Jason Schwartzman. He resuscitated Bill Murray. He got the last truly great performance out of Gene Hackman. He got the best Gwyneth Paltrow performance to date. ANd so on. Sometimes the movies were great, sometimes they were forgettable. All were meticulous scale models full of characters swaddled in white privilege: A working class, brilliant E.L. Konigsburg/J.D. Salinger worshiper’s idea of what a rich coastal family is like. But in each one, the call sheet has burned brighter than it did last time. Like Salinger with his Glass family, Anderson is a filmmaker who historically seems most comfortable around familiar faces, returning to the same actors over and over again, occasionally indoctrinating new faces into the fold and making them a part of the team. You imagine Anderson has a rock solid crew of friends he stays in touch with all the time that goes back decades. While he’s been accused of making impersonal work, he’s clearly forged loyalty and enduring love amongst his ever-growing community of actors. WhileAsteroid Citymay have marked the first time an Anderson film suffered from the malady known as Too Many Guys, this week’sThe Phoenician Schemefinds him once again getting maximum mileage out of a stacked cast. It’s also the most pure fun-engine movie Anderson’s made sinceMoonrise Kingdom, light on its feet and constantly moving, with a layer-cake narrative for the ages—it’s kind of a botched heist, kind of a cold-case detective story, kind of a dense screwball espionage thriller, and (of course) kind of a story about an absent parent connecting with an estranged child through a stream of deadpan quips and a fog of tobacco smoke. But most importantly, it’s an episodic Mega Man-format adventure, with Benecio Del Toro, Michael Cera, and Mia Threapleton (a brilliant newcomer to the Extended Wes Anderson Cinematic Universe) fumbling their way through successive boss levels, each given their motifs and moments to shine. In honor of Anderson’s latest, we’ve updated our assessment of Anderson’s career as a Pat Riley-level utilizer of superstar talent across his thirteen films. And yes, we said thirteen—we’re countingThe Phoenician Schemebut alsoThe Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Three More, a collection of short films for Netflix (one of which won Wes his first Oscar) that we’re treating here as a single omnibus movie. A brief aside on methodology: In order to make this list possible, and legible, we set the bar at a minimum of two Anderson films to qualify. Some of the actors on the list below slipped in on a “technicality” by virtue of showing up for some light voice work in an animated film, but with Anderson it’s hardly a technicality. And to be clear, this ranking is not an evaluation of talent. Some great actors end up behind novices, because of a near criminal lack of things to do in Anderson’s scripts. Working through his films in succession forces you to occasionally slap your forehead in aggravation and wonder, is thisreallythe best you could do with 20 years of Willem Dafoe? So friends, throw on your go-to, well tailoredsummer seersucker,grab arum cannonball, and let’s dive deep into Wes Anderson’s wide world of brilliant friends and co-workers. (BONUS:As a brief sub-list, I’ve put together a top 20 of Anderson’s one-time collaborators that demands inclusion because it’s essential to the catalog. Due to word limit, time and space constraints, I will not be elaborating on any of these placements, which is a shame because I can say with no hesitation, the top two names on this list are the two single best performances in the filmography.) [*Hope Davis] 20. Irfhan Khan 19. Cate Blanchett 18. Amara Karan 17. Riz Ahmed 16. Maya Hawke 15. Ben Kingsley 14. Sara Tanaka 13. Lumi Cavazos 12, Danny Glover 11. Ben Stiller 10. Bruce Willis 9.

Gene Hackman (Author’s Note:This list was expanded, but still cut off at 30 by necessity. Apologies to Steve Park, Fisher Stevens and any other worthy players we may have missed) Films (3):Moonrise Kingdom, The Grand Budapest Hotel, Isle of Dogs Best Role:Moonrise Kingdom Notes: How did we get here? Scorsese’s first muse, the Bad Lieutenant himself, the Wolf, playing a Boy Scout commander and a prisoner sight gag with a handful of lines. Jay-Zgot more to do on “Pop Style”than Keitel has in Anderson's films. A crying shame. Films (4):The French Dispatch, Asteroid City, The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Three More, The Phoenician Scheme Best Role:The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Three More Notes:An interesting rare instance of an actor who has just been around Anderson’s films lately. He’s a generic hot guy deployable as a French guard, a singing cowboy, or an American spook. He’s best when Wes is letting him loose, as he does inAsteroid, and most of all in theHenry SugarshortThe Swan, as an on screen narrator acting out the plot and having a blast. There isn’t much he does as a performer that distinguishes him as a distinctly Andersonian player. Can’t decide if I’d like to see more or less of him going forward. Films (5):Moonrise Kingdom, The Grand Budapest Hotel, Isle of Dogs, The French Dispatch, Asteroid City Best Role:Moonrise Kingdom Notes: It’s insane the great Bob Balaban has been in five Wes Anderson movies with so little to do. I’m pretty sure he had two scenes sitting on a couch inThe French Dispatch. That’s it. Films (3):Isle of Dogs, The French Dispatch, Asteroid City Best Role:Isle of Dogs Notes: I’m probably one of the last people on Earth (except Ray Donovan fans) holding onto my belief in the potential star power of Liev Schreiber. I think back fondly on hisDaytrippersandSpheremoment, and wonder what still could be for the ersatz, stammering, Scotch-throated superstar in waiting. He’s basically the second lead in Anderson’s worst filmIsle of Dogs, for whatever that’s worth. But he’s an actual liability inAsteroid City, a distraction from the main story. Films (3):The Life Aquatic, The Darjeeling Limited, The Grand Budapest Hotel Best Role:The Darjeeling Limited Notes: Ahluwalia appears briefly in three Anderson films, most significantly inDarjeelingas a persnickety dickhead cuckold train conductor. A great beard attached to a great face that deserved more to do. Films (2):Life Aquatic, Asteroid City Best Role:Life Aquatic Notes: In many ways, the Brazilian singer/songwriter is the most interesting part ofLife Aquatic. Like everything in that film, he’s an element in a pile of random, quirky, pretty elements that doesn’t amount to much. But Seu Jorge singing Bowie is pretty hard to fuck up. Unfortunately, he shows up to do almost nothing inAsteroid City. Films (2):The Grand Budapest Hotel, The French Dispatch Best Role:The French Dispatch Notes: Films (3):The Grand Budapest Hotel, The French Dispatch, The Phoenician Scheme Best Role:The Phoenician Scheme Notes:Whenever Anderson sets a film in Europe, he makes room for this Gaul king, a dynamic, constantly-working actor who seamlessly flexes between star and supporting as well as drama and comedy in European and American films. Whether suave or befuddled, Amalric is our go-to French diplomat/bureaucrat/businessman/Gentleman Spy over the last two decades, which is exactly how Wes employs him. His roles in the Andersonverse have increased exponentially, withSchemeserving as his brightest showcase yet. Films (2):Rushmore, Fantastic Mr. Fox Best Role:Rushmore Notes: A single line inMr. Foxqualifies Brian Cox for this list, but he deserves it for his role inRushmoreas Dr. Guggenheim, yet another irritable, loving yet admonishing force in Max Fischer’s life. His performance when he’s disturbed from a coma by the voice of his life antagonist alone makes him worthy of inclusion. Films (2):Moonrise Kingdom, Isle of Dogs Best Role:Moonrise Kingdom Notes: A bit role inDogsgets her here. You could note Hayward’s wardrobe and makeup and conclude her Suzy is a cut and paste job fromThe Royal Tenenbaums, little Margot plucked from the Upper West Side and plopped down on a remote island off the New England coast. But Suzy isn’t that. She's allowed to be vulnerable and goofy and childlike in a way few Anderson children had been permitted to be before, alongside her goofy and vulnerable love interest. This is both the strength and weakness of the character, a refreshing change up for a director whose kids are usually portrayed as small adults, precocious and turned cold by trauma, but a decision that also makes for an occasionally grating and somewhat clunky performance on rewatches. Films (3)/(2):Isle of Dogs, Asteroid City, The Phoenician Scheme/Asteroid City, The Phoenician Scheme Best Role:Isle of Dogs & Asteroid City Notes: I’m lumping these two legends together, as Wes does inThe Phoenician Scheme, because early in their tenure as company players it appears Anderson likes utilizing their skillsets in similar ways. They are gravitas machines, radiating dignity and institutional power with each breath on screen, and Anderson takes full advantage of the decades of work they’ve put in to become grandfathers of cinema. InThe Phoenician Schemethey’re in Randolph and Mortimer Duke mode, two grouchy hooping American vulture capitalists who strut in and out of the film, maxing out their usage. Films (2):Moonrise Kingdom, The French Dispatch Best Role:The French Dispatch Notes: Anderson tends to utilize McDormand as a hard-barked intellectual saddled with an elusive yearning for physical touch that demands satisfaction. She’s more or less wasted inMoonriseas a wife who’s betraying Bill Murray with Bruce Willis’ dull but surprisingly soulful Captain Sharp. But inDispatchshe owns the second vignette as a journalist married to her career, serving as an inspiration and guiding spirit to a student protest—and as sexual tutor and editor to Timothee Chalamet’s Zeffirelli. Films (5):Moonrise Kingdom, The Grand Budapest Hotel, Isle of Dogs, The French Dispatch, Asteroid City Best Role:The French Dispatch Notes: In Matt Zoller Seitz’sThe Wes Anderson Collection: The Grand Budapest Hotel, Anderson describes both Swinton and Willem Dafoe’s roles in his universe as something closer to performance artists than “just” actors, suggesting that they go beyond the base requirements of assuming character. Anderson sums up Swinton’s performance in bothMoonriseandBudapest: “Her character(s).....are meant to be real people, and human characters. But at the same time, you could say they’re something else.” Across five films Swinton is wacky, chameleonic, heavy on makeup, prosthetics, and accents. Her best turn of the bunch is probably the Aspergery, flighty, New York art-world type who narrates the Benicio Del Toro vignette inFrench Dispatch. Films (5):Moonrise Kingdom, The Grand Budapest Hotel, Isle of Dogs, The French Dispatch, Asteroid City Best Role:Moonrise Kingdom Notes: Norton is a kind of demarcating line between movements in Anderson's career. He has quietly become a staple player for Anderson, showing up in every film Wes has made since debuting inMoonrise Kingdom. In that film he’s a hapless Boy Scout detective/protector, inGrand Budapesthe’s a uniformed jackboot with a semblance of humanity—this more or less explains his utility in this universe. In Anderson's hands, a famously difficult and autocratic talent—the kind of actor who wants to interrogate the motivation behind every line and won't settle for anything but final cut—becomes a helpless automaton, futilely attempting to impose the illusion of control on havoc. Films (4)/(3):Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, The Darjeeling Limited/Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, The Life Aquatic Best Role:The Royal Tenenbaums & Rushmore Notes: These actors work in tandem because they serve largely the same roles in the early Anderson films. They’re mascots—the believable support and cuddly hearts of their films, Sancho Panzas who endear us to the film's protagonists for their loyalty to each other. They also couldn’t be more different. Cassel accumulated 219 credits over the course of a legendary 58-year career; Pallana was a Dallas coffee shop/yoga studio/smoothie and samosa proprietor turned character-actor linchpin who went on to put together a respectable career for himself after Anderson more or less discovered him. One of the punchlines ofBottle Rocketis Pallana, an expert safecracker who's totally full of shit and has no clue what he’s doing; it’s a gag that helped Anderson unlock his approach to both this film and the rest of his filmography. If Anderson wrote one of these parts again, it would probably go to, say, Denzel Washington or Al Pacino. Films (2):The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Three More, The Phoenician Scheme Best Role:The Phoenician Scheme This placement is more of a “One to Watch,” as in addition to putting up minutes in Wes’ last two films,it was just announcedAyoade will be co-writing Wes’nextfilm with Anderson and hisPhoenician Schemeco-writer Roman Coppola, theoretically signaling bigger things to come. On screen so far, Ayoade has been a delight for Wes. His humor operates in the same vein as Taika Waititi’s, imparting his nasal, reedy voice with an infectious, guileless cheer, which is particularly effective and hilarious inPhoenician Schemewhen it’s emanating from a rifle-toting guerilla freedom fighter, a classic Andersonian contrast. Films (2):The Grand Budapest Hotel, The French Dispatch Best Role:The Grand Budapest Hotel Notes: A perhaps surprisingly high placement given the body of work and screen time, but Ronan is a natural for Anderson, able to deliver his lines while retaining an individuality and warmth only one other actor near the very top of this list is capable of. InGrand Budapest, her Agatha, a pastry chef with a Mexico-shaped birthmark on her cheek, is lovely in limited minutes, and she needs to be to convey the lost love and accompanying melancholy that haunts Zero Mustafa and the film. We believe it. Films (5):Life Aquatic, Fantastic Mr. Fox, The Grand Budapest Hotel, The French Dispatch, Asteroid City, The Phoenician Scheme Best Role:The Life Aquatic Notes: As mentioned above, Dafoe and Swinton are of a piece in Anderson’s universe, up for anything no matter how bizarre or extreme. Anderson has narrowly interpreted Dafoe’s rather infinitely dynamic talent as menacing, a pitbull henchman thug loyal to his master, be it for “good” (As Klaus inAquatic) or evil (as Rat inFoxand Jopling inGrand Budapest). Films (4):The Life Aquatic, The Grand Budapest Hotel, Isle of Dogs, Asteroid City Best Role:The Life Aquatic Notes: The quirky king of idiosyncratic line delivery was an obvious fit for Anderson and has been a core (bit) player for nearly 20 years. He gets ample space to be “Goldblum” as an obnoxious ex inLife Aquatic, but never really gets screen time deserving of his talents again. What’s frustrating is the sense of possibility and opportunity. Like we could say about nearly every actor on this list, but particularly this tier, is how incredible would an Anderson vehicle writtenspecificallyfor Jeff Goldblum be? Films (2):The Life Aquatic, The Fantastic Mr. Fox Best Role:The Life Aquatic Notes: Only two credits, but the great Brit does the two registers of (non-Harry Potter) Gambon schtick that made him legendary: The benevolent money guy inLife Aquatic,and the scheming arch-thug inFox. His accent with that cigar-and-bacon-fat voice oozes authority and makes him a natural Anderson player, but for some reason he’s never returned. Films (3)/(3):The Grand Budapest Hotel, Isle of Dogs, The Phoenician Scheme/The Grand Budapest Hotel, The French Dispatch, Asteroid City Best Role:The Grand Budapest Hotel Notes: Lumping the old legend Abraham with the upstart Revolori may be scandalous. Both followedThe Grand Budapest Hotelwith bit parts in subsequent Anderson films, but they’ll always be linked in the hearts and minds of Wes heads as the Kate Winslett/Gloria Stuart audience-surrogate battery that powers his best film. The performances are halves of a whole, and need to pick each other up for the part, and the film to work, and they do. Films (2):The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Three More, The Phoenician Scheme Best Role:The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Three More Notes:Cumberbatch is an instant “What Took You So Long?” addition as Wes has moved to the European Theatre period of his career. He’s a Fiennes alternate, a proper English gentleman with a rich baritone, West End chops, and quippy timing honed by playing Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Strange and Hamlet. He’s the star ofHenry Sugarand the big bad inPhoenician Scheme, a reflection that Wes recognizes he has found yet another linchpin to play with. Films (2):Isle of Dogs, Asteroid City, The Phoenician Scheme Best Role:Asteroid City Notes: A very logical addition to the troupe. Johansson is at her best when offering flat affect as an impossible and unapproachable goddess, drained of emotion.Asteroid Cityis, essentially, a two-hander between her and Schwartzman. As Midge Campbell, a Marilyn Monroe type, she’s both cold and alluring, gorgeous and captivating. A shame that it’s in Anderson’s worst live action film to date. Films (2):The French Dispatch, The Phoenician Scheme Best Role:The Phoenician Scheme Notes:I lovedThe Phoenician Scheme, but the idea behind it is probably better than the great finished product, which is Wes Anderson falling in love with Del Toro on the set ofThe French Dispatchand writing a movie around him, which historically has always proven to be a great idea over the course of the last 30 years but for some inexplicable reason hasn’t happened nearly enough. What’s great about this performance isn’t just how different it is from Del Toro’s poet maniac inFrench Dispatch—it’s that Anderson has unlocked a gear in Del Toro that even I, a lifetime diehard believer in Benicio (an Oscar winner who should have somewhere between two and four statues) never knew he had. He’s a hand-grenade gift of diplomacy here, upright and dignified, firing off staccato line deliveries between the typical Del Toro eccentricities that are given room to blossom, and in playing another Andersonian rogue-patriarch figure he seamlessly joins a proud lineage of giants. Films (3):The French Dispatch, Asteroid City, The Phoenician Scheme Best Role:The French Dispatch Notes: Probably the most difficult placement on the list. In my heart Jeffrey Wright belongs no lower than #7. He’s the heart and soul ofThe French Dispatchas an expat James Baldwin figure who drives home the power and message of the film, as well as the justifiable love it has for Bill Murray’s editor/patriarch. But getting ⅓ of a film up against what amounts to starring roles for the rest of this list won’t reasonably allow me to justify placing him any higher. Films (5):The Darjeeling Limited, Fantastic Mr. Fox, The Grand Budapest Hotel, The French Dispatch, Asteroid City Best Role:Grand Budapest Hotel Notes: You run out of ways to say an actor was “Made for Wes Anderson”—but just look at his nose, his delicate, aristocratic features, his angular frame, his voice. His first Anderson role begins with him out-sprinting Bill Murray for a train, then splitting the rest of the film in thirds with Anderson’s two other core actors. The obvious symbolism and general assumption would be that Brody was being tapped to become Anderson’s new leading man and muse. It didn’t end up working out that way, which is perhaps for the best. Brody isn’t quite as far out there as Dafoe and Swinton, but occupies a space closer to the margin than the center, down to add color and play broad, funny supporting characters in subsequent efforts. It’s why his profane, jilted gangster brat inGrand Budapest—comfortably insulting Ralph Fiennes as a “candy ass” in Europe in the 1930s—is my favorite performance of his. He’s violent, hilarious, and outrageous, playing against type and having a blast. Films (5):The Royal Tenenbaums, The Life Aquatic, The Darjeeling Limited, Isle of Dogs, The French Dispatch Best Role:The Royal Tenenbaums Notes: The women in Anderson’s early films were often the same archetype: an idealized, cryptic and beautiful object with dramatic eye makeup for men to project their damage onto and compete over. Huston is the lone exception, the distant mother figure, not quite as remote and withholding as the rest of Anderson’s cavalcade of withholding and remote (often dead) parents. Anderson perfectly capitalizes on her gravitas, her royal cinematic bloodline, our relationship with her decades spanning equal parts severe and gorgeous image that demands a camera to capture it, as the estranged matriarch and ex-wife of his cinematic universe. Films (3):Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums Best Role:The Royal Tenenbaums Notes: It’s somehow been 22 years since Wes Anderson has made a film with his first protagonist. Luke was the soul and early anchor of Anderson’s early films. In many ways he’s the anti-Owen, who is a force of personality try-hard practically making you like him and follow his orders. Luke is the clinically depressed homecoming king. You inherently want to follow him and believe in his decency. In his masterpiece, he’s a broken fount of warmth and forgiveness, free from the petty resentments that plague the rest of his family, and yet the most fucked up and damaged of them all. It’s one of the very best performances of the 90s, and the third best performance ever in an Anderson film. Films (2):The Grand Budapest Hotel, The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Three More Best Role:The Grand Budapest Hotel Notes:How can someone with two meager credits possibly rank so high on this list, especially when one is toggling between a narrator and a weird cartoonish humanoid rat guy in a Netflix streamer? (Though it must be said, he shows tremendous range in that streamer, which suggests we’ve only scratched the surface of what Fiennes can do with Anderson’s dialogue.) The answer is that Fiennes’ interpretation of M. Gustave is simply the greatest single performance on this list. Not just in sheer star power, though it very much has that from an actor with as much skill and power as anyone below, but in its interpretation and understanding of the statement Anderson wanted to make in his big statement film, what he’d been working towards his entire career. Gustave is pretentious and refined and a dignified professional with immaculate taste, but warm and funny and a little slimy. Once Wes got all of his baggage and grade-school influences out of his system, he became a mature artist, and Gustave, aided by Fiennes, is the realization of his voice, his sensibility, and his value system as that artist. A perfect synthesis of a genius performer and a genius writer/director. Films (7):Bottle Rocket, The Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic, The Darjeeling Limited, Fantastic Mr. Fox, The Grand Budapest Hotel, The French Dispatch Best Role:Bottle Rocket Notes: Anderson’s first writing partner, Wilson is one of the only actors that are given rope to be consistently strange and surprising in his readings and deliveries, not beholden to what has become a kind of house acting style of soul weary pain via loss delivered in monotone. As Dignan, he’s the source code for the Anderson cinematic universe, a moron trying to use the bonds of friendship and cobbled-together family to force order on chaos, even as he serves as a chaos agent upsetting the “natural” order of life. Anderson has been characterized (and has caricatured himself,in a classic AMEX commercial) as a dictator on set, the kind you have to be to maintain his painterly frames. Dignan is both a Wes avatar and the anti-Wes, a micromanager running an exact schedule for himself and those around him for a train about to run off an unfinished bridge into the bottom of a ravine, supremely confident and blissfully unaware he’s a numbnuts, a spacey existentialist and homey good ol’ boy with his still-prominent Dallas drawl. Films (8):Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic, Darjeeling Limited, Fantastic Mr. Fox, Moonrise Kingdom, The French Dispatch, The Phoenician Scheme Best Role:Rushmore Notes: Hard to say where Wes Anderson or Bill Murray would occupy the space they currently do in the culture if either man hadn’t made the decision to gamble on one another in 1998. OnRushmore, Murray took a 1990s SAG day rate—Anderson estimates he made around $9,000 total—for a project that ended up changing both their lives. No one is better than Murray at Anderson’s odd house blend of intellectual, articulate profanity and deadpan melancholy. Maybe Anderson does his best writing with Murray in mind, or maybe Murray was born to deliver his dialogue; either way, at this point they’re a symbiotic unit. In Anderson’s films, Murray is both dignified and coarse, pompous and absurd, a loving selfish brute cutting through the pretensions and formality of polite society. Perhaps Anderson and Murray didn’t invent this archetype: the magnetic, irascible, irresistible disappointment-sponge/father figure, but together (with an early assist from Gene Hackman), they perfected it. It is fitting that in their latest film together, Anderson drops all pretenses and at last casts Murray as a gigantic, literal God. Films (8):Rushmore, The Darjeeling Limited, Fantastic Mr. Fox, Moonrise Kingdom, The Grand Budapest Hotel, The French Dispatch, Asteroid City Best Role:Rushmore Notes: The story goes that Wes Anderson wanted “a 15 year old Mick Jagger” to play the role of Max Fischer, and in Jason Schwartzman, a beauty-marked, preternaturally confident adolescent with no prior credits, he found an actor who fit that seemingly-uncastable description—the swarthy, scrawny scion of the Coppola empire, whose immense star power was immediately undeniable. Going intoAsteroid City, crowning Schwartzman the king of Anderson’s filmography over Bill Murray might’ve been an impossible toss up. What ends up giving Schwartzman the nudge is that, with his performance in Wes’s 11th movie, he’s completed a full arc-of-life journey you can trace specifically in the eight films he’s made with Anderson, from ingénue and eternal kid brother to hangdog, burnt-out, Anderson-archetypal shitty dad. Their joint filmography is like a version of fellow Texan Richard Linklater’sBoyhoodthat spans twenty-five years of Schwartzman’s life and career. He’s only been additive in his work with Anderson, both a perfect supporting compliment and star, able to hold his own in every shot or chip in a joke and shuffle off. He’s cycled through every type of character in the Anderson universe with no signs of their creative partnership slowing down. He’s been the perfect team player.",

    "title": "For Key Cuomo Voters, “Holding Your Nose” Means Overlooking the Scandals",
    "article_text": "It was one of those rare moments when the political crossed over into the genuinely personal and painful. Last week,Adrienne Adams,the Speaker of the New York City Council and a candidate for mayor, was standing at a podium next to a framed photograph of her father, who had died of COVID five years ago to the day after being turned away from the overwhelmed Elmhurst, Queens, hospital where his daughter now stood. Adams, wiping away tears, attributed the pandemic plight of city hospitals to what she said was mismanagement byAndrew Cuomo,who iscurrently the front-runnerin June’s Democratic mayoral primary. “I remember begging then governor Cuomo, begging his office to send life-saving vaccines to my community. And for weeks and months, our request was denied,” sherecalled, while urging voters to “stop electing the politicians who visit and start empowering the people who never left.” Cuomo’s campaign spokesman calls it “absolutely false” that the governor denied vaccines to city residents and “a ridiculous assertion” that he weakened hospitals. But in highlighting a specific, contentious episode, Adams was also hitting on a broader mystery in the mayor’s race. Cuomo’s nearly 11-year record as governor includes successes. But it also includeschoicesthat were a mixed bag for neighborhoods like Elmhurst—and yet he has maintained a solidpolling leadwith New York’s Black and Hispanic voters. They are hardly the only New Yorkers who so far seem willing to overlook Cuomo’s flaws. Whether in the people’s republic ofPark Slope, Brooklyn, or elsewhere, there’s been a significant polling gap between Cuomo’sunpopularityand his electability. Nowhere is the contradiction more apparent than in many of the conventional liberal voters I’ve talked with. They’ll express dismay over the sexual harassmentallegationsagainst Cuomo made by 11 women (accusations documented in a report from state attorney generalLetitia James,though vehemently denied by Cuomo). They’ll say they dislike how Cuomo’s department of health issued adirectivethat required nursing homes to admit COVID-positive patients during the pandemic. And then they’ll say they’re planning to vote for him anyway. “Voters will negotiate with themselves,” saysBasil Smikle,a former executive director of the state’s Democratic Party and an MSNBC contributor. “They’ll ask themselves: What’s more important here, my connection to a movement like #MeToo or Black Lives Matter, which may have run its course, or something that I care about immediately, which is my quality of life and the need to have the city run a different way?” A frustrated strategist working for one of Cuomo’s opponents puts it more vividly: “You have people in focus groups who say, ‘Yeah, I know he killed a lot of people in nursing homes, but I kind of like the guy.’ I don’t know what to do with that.” (Cuomo hasarguedthat the New York State Department of Health directive was simply following federal guidance, and his campaign spokesman now claims that no credible report has ever definitively found that the order directly contributed to additional COVID deaths.) Familiarity is part of the reason for Cuomo’s resilience. He has been a major political presence for more than four decades, following in the footsteps of his father, former governor Mario Cuomo. “Familiarity should not be mistaken for loyalty,” Adams tells me, heatedly, a week after her hospital speech. “People had been thinking,This is the man that was on TV every day, giving us a report. But wait a minute. We also lost so many people.Those deaths could have been prevented under his watch as well.’” But name recognition doesn’t entirely explain the pattern. For many civilians, records and particulars matter less than many political insiders would like. AsBill Clintonhassaid, people often prefer leaders who are strong and wrong to those who are weak and right. Cuomo has always looked up to Clinton. And he has been nothing if not strong for the bulk of his political career. That muscular image may be especially handy at the moment thanks to the incumbent mayor and president.Eric Adamswon a narrow victory in the 2021 Democratic primary largely on the promise to restore law and order, but he’s fumbled his way through themigrant crisisand a series ofcorruption scandals.Donald Trump’s offensives against the city have included seizing immigrants andclawing backtens of millions in federal funding. “Yes, the nursing home scandal is very real. Yes, Cuomo did have people in his administration who were close to him go to prison,” saysChristina Greer,a political science professor at Fordham University and a cohost of theFAQ NYCpodcast. “But I think a lot of voters are making a calculus about who can essentially stand up for New York City in the Trump era. What many of them remember was, in a time of extreme crisis, the president was saying,Inject yourself with bleach,and the governor was having a daily press conference saying,We’re gonna keep calm and here’s what we’re doing.” Cuomo has long been a staunch believer in the power of TV ads, and a(supposedly independent) Super PAChasraisedmore than $9 million to help his cause. Otherwise, perhaps wisely aware of his high negatives, Cuomo has run an extremelyrisk-averse campaign, agreeing to only a handful of interviews,one of whichwas with the Free Press’sBari Weiss,and appearing very few times with other candidates. Which greatly raises the stakes for two scheduled primary debates, on June 4 and June 12. It’s been nearly seven years since Cuomo last participated in a debate. The race appears to be tightening as it enters the final month and voters start paying more attention. In new polling fromPIX11, Emerson College, and The Hill, Cuomo’s closest competitor, democratic socialistZohran Mamdani,hasclosedthe first-round voting gap with Cuomo to 12 points and, in a ranked-choice simulation, to single digits in the final round. Adrienne Adams has some reason to hope as well: Despite entering the race late, the most recentMarist pollshowed her support aboutdouble, to 11%, and the city’s campaign finance board justapprovedmore than $2 million in public matching funds for her. In the upcoming debates, Adams will talk about policy details. But she will also take square, emotional aim at her main rival. “Showing the total picture of who Andrew Cuomo was during this pandemic is resonating,” she tells me. “Holding your nose—that’s not okay.” The Dizzying Rise of MAHA WarriorCalley Means, RFK Jr.’s Right-Hand Man The UnsinkableKathy Bates From RFK Jr. to Patrick Schwarzenegger, a Brief Guide tothe Kennedy Family Why Is Trump Pardoning  thisReality TV CoupleConvicted of Fraud?

    "title": "Taylor Swift's “Been Bursting Into Tears of Joy” Now That She Finally Owns All of Her Masters",
    "article_text": "Taylor Swiftannounced Friday that she now owns the master recordings to her first six albums, a happy conclusion to a career-defining feud with retired managerScooter Braun, who purchased and then sold the recordings to a private equity company in a move Swift called “nefarious,” and provided the impetus for both her(Taylor’s Version)re-recording project and an ad hoc crash course in copyright law. On Friday, Swift posted an emotionalstatement to her websitewith the news. “I've been bursting into tears of joy at random intervals ever since I found out that this is really happening. I really get to say these words: All of the music I've ever made...now belongs...to me. And all my music videos. And all the concert films. The album art and photography. The unreleased songs. The memories. The magic. The madness. Every single era. My entire life's work.” Swift bought back the master recordings for her first six albums from Shamrock Capital, the private equity firm that itself purchased them in 2020 from Braun's Ithaca Holdings for $300 million. The details of Swift's new deal with Shamrock have not been disclosed. Representatives for Swift and Shamrock did not immediately returnVanity Fair’s requests for comment. The move is the culmination of afeud that can be traced all the way backtoKanye West’s infamous utterance of “Imma let you finish” onstage at the 2009 MTV VMAs, cutting a stunned Swift’s acceptance speech off to explain why a mortified-lookingBeyoncéshould have gotten the honor instead. In the intervening years,Swift’s long-term reactionto that incident has upended the music industry. See, West was then managed by Braun, whohas since retired from managementbut also shepherded the careers ofSelena Gomez, Ariana Grande,andJustin Bieber, among others. In 2017, Swift releasedReputation, a sonic middle finger to her haters, Braun included. In 2019, Braun purchased Big Machine Records, the label that had released Swift’s first six albums, meaning that her enemy’s ally was in full control of her back catalogue, and would not only make money any time Swift herself saw success, but also that Swift had toget specific permission from Braunto use her songs in many cases. Then, in 2020,Braun sold the mastersto private equity group Shamrock Capital.Swift saidthat she was never given a true opportunity to buy them. When Swift's contract with Big Machine expired in November 2018, she signed with Republic Records, and also hatched a plan with alittle help fromKelly Clarkson: She began, one by one, re-recording and re-releasing those early albums, appending(Taylor’s Version)to each track and album title to differentiate them from the originals. Beginning in 2021 with the release ofFearless (Taylor's Version), Swift found ways to encourage the new versions to take precedence on streaming services, cutting Braun and the new owners out of the revenue loop and ensuring that she would eventually hold the rights to at leastsomeversion of her full catalogue. But the blood, it remained bad. “To say this is my greatest dream come true is actually being pretty reserved about it,” Swift wrote in the letter posted Friday. She thanked fans for coming out in droves during herrecord-breaking Eras Tour, which made thebillionaire musician even richer. “The passionate support you showed those albums and the success story you turned The Eras Tour into is why I was able to buy back my music,” she wrote of the tour and re-releases. “I can't thank you enough for helping to reunite me with this art that I have dedicated my life to, but have never owned until now.” Recent reports quoted anonymous sources hinting that Swift may have the chance to strike a deal with Shamrock, but with one huge error: They claimed that Braun was actively encouraging Shamrock to work with the musician. On Friday, an unnamed source “close to contract negotiations” toldVanity Fairthat that was not true. “Contrary to a previous false report, there was no outside party who ‘encouraged’ this sale. All rightful credit for this opportunity should go to the partners at Shamrock Capital and Taylor’s Nashville-based management team only,” the source said. “Taylor now owns all of her music, and this moment finally happened in spite of Scooter Braun, not because of him.” Swift’s own statement underlined her elation. “All I've ever wanted was the opportunity to work hard enough to be able to one day purchase my music outright with no strings attached, no partnership, with full autonomy. I will be forever grateful to Shamrock Capital for being the first people to ever offer this to me. The way they've handled every interaction we've had has been honest, fair, and respectful. This was a business deal to them, but I really felt like they saw it for what it was to me: My memories and my sweat and my handwriting and my decades of dreams. I am endlessly thankful. My first tattoo might just be a huge shamrock in the middle of my forehead.” All of this was a real twist for fans with predictions about a loomingReputation (Taylor’s Version)release, as according to Swift’s letter, she hasn't “even recorded a quarter of it.” “There will be a time (if you're into the idea) for the unreleased vault tracks from that album to hatch,\" she said of the 2017 album. \"I've already completely re-recorded my debut album, and I really love how it sounds now. Those two albums can still have their moments to re-emerge when the time is right, if that would be something you guys would be excited about. But if it happens, it won't be from a place of sadness and longing for what I wish I could have. It will just be a celebration now.” On social media Friday, Swiftposted photos of herselfposing with the vinyl pressings of her early albums, captioned “You belong with me,” and pointing readers toward her site.

Madison Square Garden has been ablaze during with excitement and famous fans as the New York Knicks face down the Indiana Pacers in a bid for the conference title and a shot at the NBA Finals in June. Historically, there’s nothing like some good old-fashioned sports shouting to really bring people together, just ask the spectators at the Colosseum. Commoner or elite, there’s just something about screaming your head off while watching athletic feats, something that we’ve seen still holds true centuries later, as we watch the likes ofTimothée Chalamet, Walt “Clyde” Frazier,Bill Murray, and more flock to watch the New York Knicks in their push for the NBA’s Eastern Conference champs title.

    "title": "Donald Trump’s Pardon Spree Places MAGA Loyalists Above the Law",
    "article_text": "Tina Petersisn’t a household name. But she has been a cause célèbre in right-wing circles, particularly this week amid aDonald Trumpclemency spree. Peters, a former election official in Mesa County, Colorado, is currentlyservinga nine-year sentence for allowing an election denier to gain unauthorized access to the county’s voting machines following the 2020 election—which, echoing Trump’s conspiracy theories, Peters insisted was marred by fraud. ToMarjorie Taylor Greeneand the other MAGA figures who have championed her cause, she’s something of a government hostage. AsKari Lakeput it Monday, “She saw something criminal in Colorado elections and chose to do something as her job required.” This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Calls of “Free Tina Peters” are a distillation of Trump’s approach to criminal justice, which was perhaps bestsummed upby his pardon attorney,Ed Martin,earlier this week: “No MAGA left behind.” That certainly seems to be Trump’s motto: The presidentissued a number of pardons and commutationsthis week, including for reality starsToddandJulie Chrisley,who were convicted on fraud charges in 2022; former Republican congressmanMichael Grimm,who was convicted on a tax crime; andScott Jenkins,a former Virginia sheriff whose bribery conviction was,Trump claimed, a persecution “by the Radical Left ‘monsters.’” And there are likely more to come: Among the others who could soon benefit from his leniency is his chief trade adviser,Peter Navarro,who served four months in prison on contempt charges for defying a subpoena from the House January 6 committee; the Justice Department is reportedly considering voiding the case. Because Peters was convicted on state charges, she is not eligible for a presidential pardon. But in a social media post earlier this month, Trump said he was directing his Justice Department to “take all necessary action to help secure” her release: “Tina is an innocent Political Prisoner being horribly and unjustly punished,”hewrote. Trump has always used the powers of his presidency to benefit himself and those who suck up to him. “You don’t look like terrorists to me,” he is said to havetoldthe Chrisleys as he pardoned them, after appeals from their daughter, who spoke at the Republican National Convention last summer. Neither, it seems, do the men who plotted to kidnapGretchen Whitmer,the Democratic governor of Michigan, in 2020: “It looked to me like somewhat of a railroad job,” TrumpsaidWednesday of their convictions, suggesting he would consider pardoning them. “I’ll take a look at that.” (Whitmer, who has taken a more cooperative approach to the Trump administration than some of her fellow Democratic governors,tolda local NBC outlet that she was “very disappointed that they are even considering it.”) The message is clear: Supporters like the Chrisleys can get preferential treatment from this president, with those who would engage in criminal activity on his behalf, like Peters, perhaps feeling further incentivized to do so. “Donald Trump is trying to create a two-tiered legal system in our country,” Colorado secretary of stateJena Griswoldtold me. “One for his supporters, where they can do whatever the heck they want, including storming the Capitol and threatening election officials’ lives. And a second tier for his opponents and potentially everybody else.” Trump, of course, began his second term bypardoningthe 1,500 “J6 hostages,” as he called them—including leaders of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers militia groups—who rioted at the Capitol in his name in 2021, That went beyond what even his vice president,JD Vance,and other allies said he would and should do: “If you committed violence on that day,” Vance said a week before Trump’s inauguration, “obviously you shouldn’t be pardoned.” But Trump did not agree with Vance; he saw himself more asa “king.”And he has applied that approach to the legal system, using it as a threat against opponents; a reward for allies; and even, in the case of New York mayorEric Adams,anapparent bargaining chip. (The mayor’s corruption case was dropped after he said he was“collaborating”with the administration on its mass deportation plan.) Democratic senatorAdam Schiff,who investigated Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election as a member of the House January 6 committee, told me that “Trump’s routine disregard for the rule of law makes a mockery of the idea that we are a nation of laws, not men,” paraphrasing John Adams. Of course, politics have always loomed over the pardon process. But Trump has taken it to “a different level,” said legal analystKim Wehle,author ofPardon Power: How the Pardon System Works—and Why.“The law,” Wehle told me, “is being morphed into what the White House decides the law is.” On the day I spoke with Griswold, a Colorado man namedTeak Ty Brockbankwas sentenced to three years in prison for posting online threats to kill Griswold and other Democratic election officials. Brockbank said his actions had been influenced by far-right content. His attorney argued for a more lenient sentence, noting that January 6 insurrectionists had been pardoned for acting on the same kind of material. “Trump pushes up all these lies that incite folks to act in a criminal way, and then they see that he’s pardoning people who support him,” Griswold said. “Far-right actors believe that there is a different tier of justice for them.” The Dizzying Rise of MAHA WarriorCalley Means, RFK Jr.’s Right-Hand Man The UnsinkableKathy Bates From RFK Jr. to Patrick Schwarzenegger, a Brief Guide tothe Kennedy Family Why Is Trump Pardoning  thisReality TV CoupleConvicted of Fraud?

    "title": "How Elon Musk’s Reported Drug Use Aligns With RFK Jr.’s Vision for Mental Health",
    "article_text": "You can take the government out ofElon Musk(finally!), but it’s harder to take the Elon Musk out of government. The former Big DOGE hashung up his MAGA hatandbedazzled chainsawin an official capacity after 130 days—longer thanBritney Spears’ 2004 marriage toJason Alexander; shorter than her union withKevin Federline—but the influence of some of his personal philosophies appears to linger on. Reporting published by theNew York TimesFriday detailedMusk’sapparent use of a wide variety of psychiatric and recreational drugs. But! A twist! Or maybe not? Some of those drugs are endorsed byRobert F. Kennedy Jr.and his so-called MAHA movement as preferred alternatives for mainstream SSRI medications. (Musk did not respond immediately toVanity Fair’s request for comment, nor did Musk or his attorney respond to theTimes’ request for comment.) In the past, Musk has attributed his drug use to treatment: he toldDon Lemonin 2024 that he uses “small amounts” of ketamine to manage depression. “If you’ve used too much ketamine, you can’t really get work done, and I have a lot of work,” Musk said then. According to new reporting in theTimes, the amount is anything but small, and Musk imbibes psychedelics, including mushrooms and ecstasy in addition to ketamine, often enough that he allegedly told people close to him that it was “causing bladder issues,” in the Grey Lady’s delicate wording. We’ll say it: This guy wants to colonize Mars, and fully believes that he’ll be the one to make it a reality, but he can’t trust a fart. Kennedy, too,endorses alternative treatments like ketamineover traditional psychiatric drugs to manage mental health disorders. He has claimed that patients who use SSRIs to manage conditions such as depression, anxiety, and other mood disorders are “addicts” andfalsely linked use of the medicationto school shootings. During his failed presidential run in 2024, he proposed the creation of “wellness farms” to wean people off their prescription drugs. In Kennedy’s vision,psychedelics should be regulated and prescribed, while the SSRIs that he has alluded to being more addictive than heroin should recede. (Kennedy is a recovering heroin addict.) Yes, somestudies of Ketamine, MDMA, and other psychedelics have shownthat minimal use can be an effective treatment for some people, andsomesymptoms. Work in some of thevery samepeer-reviewed journals that Kennedy wants to ban scientistsfrom being allowed to publish insupports further research into the possible medical benefits of these drugs. But psychiatric treatments famously are not one-size-fits-all, and SSRIs and other meds are proven to have helped millions of people daily. Also, while some researchers have pointed out upsides of psychedelics in treatment, not a one of those upsides is “patients mayrepeatedly throw Nazi saluteson the national stage.” Musk and Kennedy’s opinions on specific medications may diverge—theTimesreported that Musk “traveled with a daily medication box that held about 20 pills, including ones with the markings of the stimulant Adderall, according to a photo of the box and people who have seen it”—but both appear to support a Mad Libs-esque DIY approach to health. Musk, snoozing in his office and treating mass job eliminations like a college robotics team hack-a-thon lock-in, allegedly mix-and-matched his drug intake including Ecstasy and mushrooms among the prescription pills. Kennedy, whorecently said, “I don’t think people should be taking medical advice from me”—a heartening statement from the guy who’sin charge of all the health oh my god—has proposed something of an elimination diet for healthcare.Take it all away, and then just…see what happens? Vaccines are in Choose Your Own Adventure territory.A recent reportpublished by Kennedy’s Department of Health and Human Services can be summed up as “put some kale on it!” Perhaps it’s time we set aside a few minutes to reflect on whether the guy who thinks a good way to combat possible future bird flu outbreaks is toimport ostricheswho have bird flu, perhaps an idea he came up with while swimming with his grandkids in aliteral shit creek, and the other guy, who’s pooping his pants and apparentlytrying to impregnateanyone wholooks like they may have a uterus, are the best models for the country’s health.

    "title": "The Dizzying Rise of MAHA Warrior Calley Means, RFK Jr.’s Right-Hand Man",
    "article_text": "Last March, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. crowded into a sweat lodge near Austin, Texas, with about 40 other people including a regenerative farming advocate and a nutritional supplement entrepreneur. “We were front to back, side to side, you couldn’t move,” Chase Iron Eyes, a Lakota legal activist, later recalled on a podcast. “I was like, man, I want to get out. I got to take a break. And then I was thinking, I’m the only Lakota in here…. My whole nation’s riding on me over here.” He stayed in. The sweat lodge was the closing event of the American Wellness Summit, a one-day fundraiser for Kennedy’s presidential campaign. Those in attendance had come in search of spiritual healing and cleansing renewal, yes, but also access to worldly power. And indeed, one of the people perspiring inside that jam-packed lodge was struck by a vision that would prove to have seismic repercussions for the health of every American. “It sounds very woo woo,” Calley Means, 39, told Joe Rogan six months later. “I just had this strong vision of [Kennedy] standing with Trump.” A former wedding-dress entrepreneur, Means had become a vocal proponent of ending chronic disease in America. Inspired by his epiphany inside the lodge, and convinced that it represented the best path to implementing Kennedy’s radical health care agenda, Means enlisted Tucker Carlson to help arrange a meeting between the candidates. On the night of July 13, after the attempted assassination of Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, Means and Carlson made the fateful introduction. “There’s rare moments in history when the deck can change,” Means told Rogan, adding that he felt “this could be a realignment of American politics.” As Means described it, the bond between the Republican fast-food aficionado and the Democratic vaccine foe was emotional and instantaneous. They “had weeks of conversations, and there was not a discussion of polling” or the political horse race, Means said. “These were tear-filled conversations about why kids are getting so diabetic, about why we have such obese children in the United States, about why we have a fertility crisis.” Leaked video of the two men talking by phone the day after the assassination attempt showed a less emotionally charged conversation. Trump could be heard wooing Kennedy and embracing his controversial theories. Riffing on an allegedly excessive childhood-vaccination shot, Trump said, “It looks like it’s meant for a horse, not a 10-pound or 20-pound baby.” In short order, Trump became president, Kennedy was sworn in as the nation’s health secretary, and Calley Means became RFK Jr.’s right hand as a White House special government employee. In May, Trump nominated Means’s sister, Casey Means, MD, a onetime surgical resident whose rise in antiestablishment health circles has mirrored Calley’s, to serve as surgeon general. The Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement had been catapulted from the left and right fringes to center stage, with the Means siblings positioned as its framers in chief. Tall and wiry with a patrician air and often intense public demeanor, Calley Means paints a vivid portrait of endemic corruption plaguing the US health system: a poisoned food supply; doctors and scientists with undisclosed conflicts of interest; revolving-door bureaucrats; and out-of-control vaccine mandates. At the American Wellness Summit, he promised that the scourge of chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes could be reversed “very quickly” once the corruption has been vanquished. And when the FDA announced a plan to phase out certain synthetic food dyes, Means was right there at the podium, extolling “a major win of grass roots forces against special interests” and declaring that “the cries” of MAHA moms are “ringing out across the country.” A wide array of medical experts have warned that the MAHA agenda, and its slipshod implementation, will potentially set the country’s public health back years. Their plans, says Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association are “not in line with the evidence and science that we know works. As a result, people will be getting sicker, showing up for medical care at a later stage of disease, and at a higher cost.” Means betrays no doubts about the righteousness of his cause. Like many MAGA-adjacent influencers, he seems to delight in slamming his ideological enemies. At a Politico health care summit on April 2, journalist Dasha Burns asked him about mass firings at US health agencies. “It’s insane for you to insinuate that the things standing between us and better health is more government bureaucrats,” Means replied, before turning his wrath on the audience. “The lobbyists in this room [are] laughing, when we have the sickest children in the developed world.” Given Means’s dizzying rise from relative obscurity to the summit of America’s federal health apparatus, his hyperconfidence may well be justified. That climb has been propelled by the personal story he has shared often: that he was a food and pharmaceutical lobbyist who saw firsthand the collusion of both industries with medical groups and academia. And yet, a six-monthVanity Fairinvestigation raises questions about whether Means has embellished his personal story. Nine of Means’s former PR colleagues dispute some of his key biographical assertions. As well, his health care company, Truemed, which helps patients use tax-free dollars to buy wellness products, is poised to benefit from the radical health care overhaul he has been championing.VFinterviewed more than 60 people for this account, and reviewed 24 of Means’s public appearances since 2023, his social media accounts, and related federal and state legislation, tax, lobbying, and business records. In May,Vanity Fairreached out to Means and presented him with an extensive list of questions for fact-checking and comment for this story. In response, Means said, “I stand by everything I’ve said,” adding that he was not surprised that anonymous sources were “spreading lies toVanity Fair.” Means, who is a special government employee, is not listed onthe White House websiteas having obtained an ethics waiver. “He’s managed to avoid the scrutiny of a full-time government employee,” says Virginia Canter, former associate counsel to President Obama and chief anti-corruption counsel at Democracy Defenders Fund, a nonprofit organization working to defend the rule of law. Given his financial stake in health policy issues, “I am not sure that an ethics official would have signed off on this in normal times.” MAHA’s would-be reformers are not wrong about the dismal record of our profit-driven health care system. About one fourth of working-age Americans are underinsured and routinely skip unaffordable care or incur medical debt. Roughly 26 million people, about 8 percent of the population, have no health insurance at all. Prescription drugs cost almost three times as much here as they do in comparable countries. And life expectancy in the US is about four years shorter than in other wealthy nations. Americans are so fed up that, when a UnitedHealthcare executive was killed in cold blood on a Manhattan sidewalk last December, the mood in some corners of the internet was downright celebratory. Now, the MAHA movement is in charge. Its tent is big enough to include Berkeley granola heads and anti-vaxxers, fitness junkies and right-wing tech bros, and even COVID-19 deniers, who allege the pandemic never occurred. A teeming marketplace of wellness grifters is along for the ride. While the movement’s priorities range widely, from removing food dye from Froot Loops on one end to amending the Constitution to prohibit medical mandates including vaccinations on the other, they are all certain of one thing: You can’t just tighten the cables of our existing health care system. You need to blow up the bridge. In his three months in office, Kennedy has done just that. Hundreds of National Institutes of Health research studies—on everything from cancer risk factors to adolescent diabetes—have been axed. Gone are programs that tested milk for contaminants, shielded children from lead exposure, and decreased maternal mortality. Amid a raging measles epidemic, which claimed the lives of two unvaccinated children in West Texas, Kennedy has offered only tepid support for the safe, effective, and long-studied MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine, which he recently claimed falsely on a News Nation panel has “a lot of aborted fetus debris.” Meanwhile, he has touted the healing benefits of vitamin A, the hype leading a number of Texas children to be hospitalized for toxic overexposure to the nutrient. At every step, Means has been cheerleading. In late March, when Kennedy’s team forced out the FDA’s top vaccine regulator, Peter Marks, MD, Means wrote on X that Marks was a “mediocre scientist” whose “main expertise appears to be public relations and having lunch with pharmaceutical executives.” When Kevin Hall, PhD, a top nutrition scientist at NIH, resigned in late April, Means—who has no formal medical, public health, scientific, or nutritional credentials—wrote on X, “Good riddance Kevin.” Means—who has claimed falsely that COVID-19 was a foodborne illness that did not kill metabolically healthy people—has faced criticism for his lack of traditional expertise. “The arrogance of these bros…these professional podcasters who stand in front of career scientists and say, ‘What has science ever done?’’’ Representative Jake Auchincloss (D-Ma.) said at the Politico health care summit shortly after Means left the stage. “I don’t know, science eradicated measles—until two months ago.” But Means has sought to shore up his credibility by leveraging a key credential: He says that as a former lobbyist, he witnessed, and even participated in, the corrupt backroom dealmaking between pharmaceutical interests, Big Food, and the medical establishment. In a March 2024 appearance on Kennedy’s podcast, he spoke with apparent insider knowledge of how Coca-Cola had lavished money on the very medical societies that should have been speaking out against soda consumption. “You wouldn’t even believe this,” he said, “but the American Diabetes Association took millions of dollars from Coke. I helped funnel it.” That personal narrative of conversion contributed to vaulting the book he cowrote with his sister, Casey Means,Good Energy: The Surprising Connection Between Metabolism and Limitless Health,to the top of the bestseller list. Casey, a physician, runs a health technology company called Levels, which helps customers track their blood glucose levels using continuous glucose monitors. She does not have an active medical license. With their Ivy League pedigrees and skyrocketing trajectories, the Means siblings have aroused suspicion among some of the MAHA faithful. Some fear that they may be part of a “controlled opposition,” sent by the global elite to sabotage Kennedy’s mission to smash the vaccine-industrial complex. Means confronted two such critics on a heated episode of theDanny Jonespodcast, a show dedicated to bringing “fringe cultures to a wide audience.” Defending his MAHA street cred, Means said “seeing that darkness” of corrupt dealmaking has been “foundational to who I am and what my story is.” But former colleagues from his time at Mercury Public Affairs and Edelman, the two publicity firms that employed Means, say his work would not have put him in the meetings he’s described. In some instances, the firms where he worked did not represent the clients whose meetings he says he staffed. His former mentor Steve Schmidt, a longtime Republican strategist who brought Means into Mercury and oversaw his work there, then helped him land the job at Edelman, says, “Calley Means is not a whistleblower. He is an opportunist, peddling junk science to make millions.” On January 2, 2023, Calley Means made his social media debut as a Big Soda whistleblower. In a lengthy Twitter thread, he wrote, “Early in my career, I consulted for Coke to ensure sugar taxes failed and soda was included in food stamp funding. I say Coke’s policies are evil because I saw inside the room.” He went on to lay out the company’s playbook: “Coke gave millions to the NAACP and the Hispanic Federation—both directly and through front groups like the American Beverage Association.” The civil rights groups, he said, in turn denounced soda restrictions as racist. He shared a 2013New York Timesarticle documenting the payments that flowed from the beverage industry to dozens of health advocacy and minority civil rights groups, enabling the defeat of soda regulations. He said the conversations he witnessed were “depressingly transactional.” It was just the kind of urgent, insider stuff that breaks through the noise, and the tweet thread garnered 12.3 million views and 52,000 likes. Means offered even more vivid details on a podcast hosted by Dhru Purohit, a Truemed investor. “I was sitting in a room with the NAACP and Coke executives,” Means said. “It was very unsettling. It was Coke executives telling the most prominent civil rights group in the United States, ‘We’re going to pay you millions of dollars, and we need you to call our opponents racists to shut down the debate.’” Means would later tell Joe Rogan that, on behalf of the pharmaceutical industry, he helped steer money to academia to downplay the opioid crisis. “I tried to scratch my brain and made a few calls, to make sure I wasn’t going crazy…Maybe there was a six-month window when we all blacked out, this client came in, and Calley became the whisperer behind the scenes, plotting a supposedly nefarious role with soda executives.” Means explained to the fitness trainer Jillian Michaels, on her podcastKeeping It Real,that “the food and pharma industries were my two big clients. I was a lobbyist and consultant…one of my big accounts was the American Beverage Association, which is the front group for Coke.” Michaels had introduced him as the “number one whistleblower in America.” “I was completely mesmerized by his ability to tell the truth about the health care industry,” Vani Hari, a nutrition blogger known online as Food Babe, recalls. “I had never seen anyone like him before do that, in such a bold truth-telling fashion. I extremely admired that.” Hari has become a staunch ally of Means’s and a voluble proponent of the MAHA agenda, often appearing at Trump administration events. As his stature grew, Means received relatively little pushback. In 2023, however, the journalist Helena Bottemiller Evich, who covers the food industry in her Food Fix newsletter, asked him which consulting firm he was referencing in his Big Soda thread. Means “declined to specify,” she wrote. Means is not a whistleblower in the legally recognized sense. He didn’t notify the authorities of any corporate wrongdoing or risk a job to divulge sensitive information. Many of the dealings he described were real, but they had been documented in the press long before he spoke out about them. In at least eight public appearances identified byVF, Means has said he had been a lobbyist. A review of US lobbying records show that he has never registered as one. In the two years since his viral tweet thread, he’s been introduced as a “former food lobbyist” or “Coca-Cola whistleblower” in dozens of podcasts and presentations. Last August he appeared with his sister on Tucker Carlson’s show. As Carlson said to him, “You were a lobbyist, okay?” Means did not dispute the characterization and went on to describe how, as a junior employee, he attended a meeting where the food companies were “paying off, you know, nutrition researchers at Harvard and Stanford.” “So you saw that?” Carlson asked. “My first week, you know, working for these industries,” Means replied. The episode became the most shared podcast of 2024, according to Apple rankings. The bigger his audience, and the more Means spoke, the more bewildered his former colleagues at Mercury and Edelman say they became, as they recalled the largely administrative work Means had done at Mercury, and the more benign PR he’d been tasked with at Edelman. “I tried to scratch my brain and made a few calls, to make sure I wasn’t going crazy,” says one former Mercury colleague. “Maybe there was a six-month window when we all blacked out, this client came in, and Calley became the whisperer behind the scenes, plotting a supposedly nefarious role with soda executives.” Means grew up “down the street from the White House,” as he said in a 2023 biographical video. His father, Grady, worked as an aide to Richard Nixon’s health secretary, then led the Food and Nutrition Task Force to reform America’s food stamp program under Gerald Ford. He went on to run PricewaterhouseCoopers’s government consulting business. Means ran track and field at Georgetown Prep, then majored in political science at Stanford University, where he was president of the Kappa Sigma fraternity. He was drawn toward libertarianism, notably the idea that the free market should be protected from government intervention. As a rising junior in college, he interned at the Heritage Foundation and worked on a report whose language hews closely to his stance almost 20 years later. “Congress should not consider any health care legislation that does not expand personal control over health care dollars, expand consumer choice and competition, and reduce the already excessive level of health care regulation,” the 2006 report stated. His early résumé, obtained byVanity Fair,displays a penchant for hyperbole. He describes a three-month White House internship at the offices of Presidential Scheduling and Correspondence, at age 19, as follows: “Acted as liaison between the President and American soldiers in Iraq by analyzing and referring letters, e-mails, and comments from soldiers directly to the President.” A separate bullet point notes that he was “Youngest White House intern selected in 2005.” On the 2008 McCain campaign, he became part of a “pit crew,” working to help resuscitate the sinking reputation of vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. From there, he followed senior campaign adviser Steve Schmidt, who returned to Mercury Public Affairs where he was a partner. In January 2009, at age 23, Means arrived at the company’s Sacramento office. On LinkedIn, Means says he worked there as a “Director,” and describes his responsibilities as follows: “Collaborated with team of lawyers and management consultants to advise companies facing high-profile public strategy challenges. Clients in pharma, food, and energy spaces.” In reality, Schmidt and other former Mercury employees say, Means was his executive assistant. He was chiefly responsible for organizing Schmidt’s travel, managing his schedule and expenses, and compiling his briefing notebooks. (Schmidt has become an outspoken critic of the Republican Party under Trump and cofounded The Lincoln Project. He resigned from the board in 2021 during a period of turmoil sparked by another cofounder’s sexual harassment scandal.) Means “definitely wanted to be in the strategic conversations, and that sometimes annoyed people,” a former senior Mercury official recalls. “He wore his smartness on his sleeve, like someone who wanted to matter.” Some colleagues recall him as a goofy frat boy, who drank to excess at after-hours work events and once bought his office mates wearable Snuggie blankets. Others found him aloof, with a “blue blood vibe,” as one former colleague put it. Schmidt recalls that he was once at a Starbucks at Ronald Reagan Airport, only to have his credit card declined. That led to his discovery that Means had failed to file more than $150,000 of Schmidt’s expenses for reimbursement, says Schmidt: “That was his competency level as an assistant.” Still, Schmidt recalls him as “thermonuclear smart,” and a “bright young man in a hurry.” Means “definitely wanted to be in the strategic conversations, and that sometimes annoyed people,” a former senior Mercury official recalls. “He wore his smartness on his sleeve, like someone who wanted to matter.” Though Mercury Public Affairs has registered lobbyists on its staff and is known to dabble in the “dark arts” of public persuasion, Means worked on the PR side, according to former coworkers. While he was there, Mercury represented a client that was trying to forestall a plastic-bag ban in California. It did represent PhRMA, the pharmaceutical industry trade group, but mostly to help it gain access to the Obama White House so it could join negotiations over the Affordable Care Act, former Mercury officials say. From 2009 to 2011, when Means worked at Mercury, the firm did not represent Coca-Cola or its trade group, the American Beverage Association, a Mercury spokesperson confirms. In 2010 the Coca-Cola Foundation did donate $135,000 to the NAACP. But at the time, Mercury was actually working the other side of the issue, representing the California Endowment in its support of an additional tax on soda as a way to fight obesity. “We ran a campaign for them to get poor communities to stop drinking soda,” one former Mercury official tellsVF.The effort was supported by California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, another Mercury client. In 2011 Schmidt helped Means land a job at Edelman in its Washington, DC, office. There, old press releases show, Means helped Harvard Business School promote a roundtable on improving US competitiveness and flacked for a company launching a “wearable tech” center in Silicon Valley. On weekends when his parents were away, he threw memorable parties at their house. At the office, several colleagues recall his air of self-importance; He seemed to have bigger and better plans ahead, which didn’t include them. “He walked around the office saying, ‘Calley Means business,’” another former colleague recounts. Means’s two-year stint at Edelman ended in 2013. The Coca-Cola Foundation again gave the NAACP $130,000 in 2011 and another $150,000 in 2012, according to its tax filings. But Edelman represented Pepsi during this period and could not have represented its archrival, say two of Means’s former colleagues at the firm, who do not recall him working closely on food and beverage issues. During Means’s tenure there, a spokesperson for Edelman says, the company did not represent either the American Beverage Association or Coca-Cola in the US. A spokesperson for the American Beverage Association confirms it never employed Edelman. Coca-Cola was unable to respond by deadline. The NAACP did not respond to a request for comment. (The American Beverage Association did fund a coalition that opposed soda restrictions during this time frame, but that group did not use Edelman to conduct PR, according to its tax filings and a former member of Edelman’s leadership team who oversaw food and beverage accounts.) The scenarios Means paints are “highly unrealistic” for another reason, says a former Edelman colleague. Had any money exchanged hands, the interactions would have included lawyers at each step and only “the highest-level folks” in the room. The former colleague adds, “A transaction [like that] at Edelman that would involve a junior associate is about as impossible or impractical an assertion that I could think of.” When reached for comment for this story, Means initially referredVanity Fairto a former colleague he described as his lieutenant “to refute your bullshit smears.” When contacted, the former colleague declined an interview, saying by text, “Calley shared the questions you sent over to him, and I did not work closely with him on those projects, so unfortunately can’t provide any background.” After Edelman, Means went on to Harvard Business School, where he met Leslie Voorhees, who already had considerable business experience and had managed a Nike factory in Jakarta, Indonesia. They married in 2016 in Portland, Oregon, and that same year launched a wedding-dress start-up called Anomalie that gave brides an affordable way to custom-design their gowns. The dresses were made in China. Means framed the company as a consequential disruptor of the status quo. “Fundamentally, the complete brokenness of the [wedding dress] industry has been an uncovered topic,” he told aForbesjournalist in 2018, “and there’s going to be a time this year when every reporter in the country is writing about it in anticipation of all these bankruptcies.” That never happened, and the couple sold Anomalie to David’s Bridal for an undisclosed price in 2022. Their son was born that year and they named him Roark, after the conformity-busting protagonist ofThe Fountainhead. The inciting incident of Means’s MAHA conversion had come a year earlier. In January 2021, Calley and Casey’s mother, Gayle Brown Means, was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and died just a few weeks later. She was 71. It was a devastating loss, and it inspired them to take action, as Means told Joe Rogan last year. “Casey and I on her grave site literally hugged each other and said we want to write a book” to raise awareness about the missed warning signs of poor health that led their mother to be “chopped down by cancer.” Casey had already “embarked on a journey to understand the real reasons why people get sick,” their book recounts.Good Energypresents a narrative of Casey Means’s own journey from medical-establishment wunderkind to prominent critic. In 2018, just months before completing her five-year residency in ear, nose, and throat surgery at Oregon Health & Science University, “I walked into the chairman’s office at OHSU and quit.” The book describes her transformation from cog in a profit-driven sick-care system, with medical training that taught her nothing about the root causes of illness, to a physician freed to have “deep conversations” with her patients to help “restore and maintain good health.” Paul W. Flint, MD, who was chairman of the Department of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery at OHSU at the time,tellsVFthat whenMeans left the program, it was because she found the surgical work “too stressful” and was not able to continue in the residency, even after taking a paid leave. Flint says that Means returned from leave saying, “‘I still can’t do this.’ She was tearful about it.” He adds that the other residents had to “cover for her, and we’re a small department and all the calls fall on them.” Two former OHSU residents who served alongside Casey tellVFthat they do not recognize the version of events laid out in the book. In their view, Casey misrepresented her residency training and proclaimed a medical conspiracy against good health that simply didn’t exist. They describe her as being anxious and fearful of harming patients. “It feels disingenuous, demonizing your practice. She didn’t make it through,” one of the former residents says. “By trying to question our entire field and sowing distrust in medicine, it’s hard to ignore that she may benefit from that.” Another former resident says, “I did not witness a spiritual awakening. It felt more and more like she was preying on the less educated and using the MD she had to tout these pseudoscience things.” (Casey Means declined to provide an on-the-record response. In a statement issued after her nomination, Stanford medical school reiterated that she graduated in 2014 and returned in 2022 to lecture on food and health. The school said: “We are proud that Casey Means, MD, has been nominated to serve as the United States Surgeon General.”) In June 2022 Calley Means and Justin Mares, founder of the Kettle & Fire bone-broth brand, launched Truemed. The goal was to enable patients to use their health savings accounts to buy wellness products. Typically, HSAs allow patients with high-deductible health insurance policies to set aside pretax money to help pay for uncovered medical expenses. Using Truemed, customers could fill out an online survey, identify their symptoms, and quickly obtain a letter of medical necessity from a doctor or nurse practitioner. The letter, in turn, would allow them to use HSA dollars to “address the root cause” of chronic diseases, as Means puts it. Truemed partners with companies that sell items ranging from supplements and red light therapy to smart mattresses that track sleep, and takes a percentage of the sales. One customer, seeking to purchase a Peloton bike through the website, filled out an online survey and in short order received a letter from a nurse practitioner citing an anxiety diagnosis and recommending “the patient bike, row, tread through class membership for 150 minutes per week.” Truemed’s initial vision was to rebrand partner companies, including the salad chain Sweetgreen and the meal-kit company Daily Harvest, as health care companies, according to early marketing materials obtained byVF.That would enable customers to use their tax-free HSA dollars to purchase food. In December 2023 aWashington Postwellness columnexplained to readers that they could now use HSA dollars for certain healthy foods and gym memberships, and Means was quoted saying that the company planned to partner with more large food brands soon. Three months later, however, the IRS issued an alert that warned, “Beware of companies misrepresenting nutrition, wellness and general health expenses as medical care” for HSAs and similar types of accounts. [Means] posted an advertisement on LinkedIn two days after the election for an opening at Truemed: a “Chief of Staff” to help manage the “intersecting worlds of Truemed and healthcare policy work.” The same day, theWashington Postran a follow-up, noting the IRS’s warning and its caveat that “medical letters must result from face-to-face interactions with the patient, either in person or through telehealth visits. Getting a medical letter by filling out a questionnaire” was “not adequate,” a potentially crushing blow to Truemed’s business model. On March 6, the day theWashington Postran its follow-up, Means had his first sit-down with RFK Jr., as a guest on his podcast. In the episode, entitled “IRS: Pro-Pharma Anti-Health,” which ran a week later, Means asserted a conspiracy. “ Well, just to give some inside baseball, uh, a literal pharmaceutical lobbyist, uh, who was upset with what we were doing, tipped off the IRS and the IRS called theWashington Post.” The IRS was embracing policies, Means suggested, that were intended to get Americans sick and onto a “pharmaceutical treadmill.” By contrast, he described his company as “disruptive” and working against entrenched interests. Sherry Glied, the dean of NYU’s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, is an economist who has studied HSAs. She says the accounts amount to a tax break for the wealthy and are “completely useless” for someone living paycheck to paycheck. “You want medical freedom?” she says. “Spend your own money. But why should I pay higher taxes because you want a Peloton bike?” On February 13, 2025, RFK Jr. was sworn in as health secretary. Speaking from the Oval Office, the scion of America’s most famous Catholic family cast his rise in religious terms. “For 20 years, I’ve gotten up every morning on my knees and prayed that God would put me in a position where I can end the childhood chronic disease epidemic in this country,” he said. “On August 23 of last year, God sent me President Trump.” Five days later he told thousands of Health and Human Services employees that he intended to wage war on “the corrosive power of money as it infiltrates and captures institutions like ours.” He vowed to remove conflicted members of advisory committees and shutter the revolving door to industry. His own conflicts, and those of his closest allies, were another story. Incoming cabinet members are supposed to forfeit any financial interests that might compromise their official duties, but Kennedy tried to retain a 10 percent stake in personal-injury litigation targeting Merck over its Gardasil vaccine. Only after a public outcry did he transfer it to his son. As for Means, he posted an advertisement on LinkedIn two days after the election for an opening at Truemed: a “Chief of Staff” to help manage the “intersecting worlds of Truemed and healthcare policy work.” Canter of Democracy Defenders Fund says Means’s post “seems to show an intent to develop policies, maybe in advance of entering government, to benefit his company.” By March, Means, now a special government employee assisting the MAHA commission, began flying from state to state and campaigning to ban sugary drinks from nutrition assistance programs. In response, MAGA lawmakers in red states have become unlikely advocates of a healthy-food movement. In late March, West Virginia’s governor signed a bill removing seven different food dyes from school lunches. To Vani Hari, the Food Babe, the GOP’s embrace of MAHA is a welcome development. It’s “so good for humanity, and so good for the country,” says Hari, who was a two-time Obama delegate but says the Democrats never took up this issue as effectively, Michelle Obama’s organic garden and Let’s Move! efforts notwithstanding. “If the Democrats want to survive, they will have to try and out-MAHA the Republicans.” Yet others question whether MAHA is a movement at all. “It’s an entity in which the branding has outstripped the content,” says Peter Lurie, president and executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest. “There is a slogan and a certain amount of grift.” From the fringes of MAHA, medical-freedom hardliners began to take aim at Means, seeing his emphasis on food policy as a misdirection strategy aimed at diluting the attack on vaccines. In blog posts, they combed through his background, questioning his links to supposedly shadowy entities from the Rockefeller family to the Council on Foreign Relations. Mary Talley Bowden, MD, who was suspended from Houston Methodist hospital in 2021 for promoting “dangerous misinformation which is not based in science,” and has campaigned to get the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines pulled from the shelf, tellsVFthat Means sparked her suspicions when he “showed up out of nowhere as a leader” of the MAHA movement, then shifted the focus from vaccines to food. “That was just a red flag for me,” she says. Others think Means has been subjected to “bad jacketing,” a targeted effort to undermine him by spreading doubt about his true-believer bona fides. “If you’re not buying into the full-metal-jacket crazy, then you’re controlled opposition,” says a physician and MAHA insider. “You’re serving some cult master that is not disclosed, in some way.” Means has done his best to assuage the suspicions, in part by adopting the fire-and-brimstone language of the MAHA fringe. He recently told a far-right streaming platform that “demonic forces” are “profiting from children being in fear, being addicted, being sick.” He’s also gone out of his way to directly attack vaccine scientists. On a CNN panel in February, he lit into fellow guest Paul Offit, a pediatrician who holds the Maurice R. Hilleman chair in vaccinology at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine, which is endowed by the pharmaceutical company Merck. Comparing Offit to a “NASCAR driver wearing their sponsors,” Means said, “I mean, that is just insane. Merck does not have children’s interests at heart.” As Offit struggled to explain that the endowed chair came with no quid pro quo, and that Merck gives money to the medical school, not to him, Means laughed out loud and spoke over him. The segment rocketed around the internet. “You’re attacked in this fire hydrant way,” says Offit, reflecting on the exchange, “for the purpose of creating a one-minute clip, to show he’s taken me on and brought me down.” In January 2024 Means arrived at the Renaissance Esmeralda Resort in Palm Springs, California, for the annual meeting of a philanthropy called Stand Together, founded by the libertarian billionaire Charles Koch. Koch-backed organizations have long sought to dismantle government-subsidized health insurance programs, from the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid to the Veterans Health Administration, and replace them with tax credits to purchase private insurance. Nothing about the exclusive event was posted online, and the organizers held the guest list close. Means was seeking funding to launch a nonprofit whose purpose was to end chronic disease, in part by lobbying the federal government to allow Americans to buy wellness items with HSA dollars—the very purchases offered by his company Truemed. Not everyone was happy to see him. One former Stand Together employee who was there viewed an alliance with him as “reputationally a third rail,” citing Means’s lack of medical credentials and the shakiness of his public-health claims. Regardless, in June 2024, Stand Together’s health care director, J.C. Hernandez, became the executive director of End Chronic Disease, Means’s nonprofit lobbying group. He has since changed his title to “co-founder” on his LinkedIn account. According to his page on the social media site, he overlapped at both organizations for six months. Previously, Hernandez had worked as a registered lobbyist for another Koch organization, Americans for Prosperity. (Neither Hernandez nor Stand Together responded to requests for comment.) “They are out there using tax-preferential dollars for wealthy people to buy saunas, and they are going to turn our entire health care system into one big GNC store.” The press release announcing the launch of End Chronic Disease listed 20 members of its coalition including Means and his Truemed partner, Mares. It made no mention of specific donors, referring only to “funding through a bi-partisan group of leaders,” and its website includes no financial disclosures. The nonprofit’s registered address leads to the same office complex in Arlington, Virginia, where Stand Together, Americans for Prosperity, and the Charles Koch Foundation are headquartered. Of the original 20 coalition members, 12 had either invested in or partnered with Truemed. Today, the coalition has grown to 28, including boldface names in the wellness space, from functional medicine doctor Mark Hyman to Jillian Michaels. Both sell their products on the site, andHyman was an investor. The End Chronic Disease website until recently directed patients to contact their legislators, urging them to support the HOPE Act (Health Out-of-Pocket Expense Act), which would allow HSA dollars to be used more expansively. In May, House Republicans passed their reconciliation tax bill, which in addition to preserving tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and gutting Medicaid, contained a number of provisions that could expand HSA use significantly. Even without that expansion, one report estimates that by the end of 2026, HSA accounts will hold more than$175 billion in assets. Many of the End Chronic Disease coalition members are selling products that would potentially benefit from such legislation: infrared saunas and cold plunges, herbal medicines and protein powders, and ketone drinks. Some are available through Truemed’s platform. Speaking withVanity Fair,Representative Jake Auchincloss says of the MAHA takeover of HHS: “Their self-designation as oracles of health care gives them license for corruption…. They are out there using tax-preferential dollars for wealthy people to buy saunas, and they are going to turn our entire health care system into one big GNC store.” On May 22, Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. sat shoulder to shoulder at the White House to deliver a report from the MAHA Commission, “Make Our Children Healthy Again.” Over 72 pages, the paper,which Means helped to coordinate,calls out the scourge of ultraprocessed foods, antidepressants, toxic pesticides, and the “possible role” of childhood vaccines in making our children “the sickest generation in American history,” as Kennedy put it. (The MAHA Commission is scheduled to deliver its follow-up strategy paper in mid-August.) The press event was in many ways the apotheosis of Means’s whirlwind rise, with the two men he’d connected less than a year earlier driving a splashy news cycle. Means was in the audience, sitting dead center, absorbing it all. In little more than a week, it would emerge that the report cited a number of studies that didn’t actually exist. A White House press secretary said that “formatting issues” were to blame. Means took to X to argue that special interests were “quibbling with footnotes” while the report had fearlessly tackled “taboo subjects.” Additional reporting and research by Liz Rosenberg.

    "title": "Mike Tyson “Should Be Dead Many Times Over”: Why the World Hasn’t Knocked Out the Champ",
    "article_text": "My earliest memories ofMike Tysonbegin in the 1990s. I have a vague recollection of his release from an Indiana prison, where heserved three yearsafter being convicted of rape, though I wasn’t old enough to grasp the facts of the case. More vivid memories came later, like his shocking defeat toEvander Holyfieldand, of course, “the bite fight.” I remember his sad display againstLennox Lewisand the even sadder post-fight interview, when he said he was going to“fade into Bolivian.”And I remember when he revealed his face tattoo to a bewildered public. There is a Tyson for every generation; the one introduced to millennials like me was less imposing in the ring and more erratic outside of it. For later generations, maybe they know the Tyson who made a cameo inThe Hangover,or the one whosquared offwithJake Paulon Netflix. And yet, the Mike Tyson in my mind’s eye often assumes the form seen in photos taken around the time I was born. Young, imperious, and not yet broken, this was the Tyson at the peak of his athletic and celebrity powers. There he was, hoisted in the air byDon King,his newly won title belt fixed to his waist. And there he was hobnobbing with celebrities, fromBrooke ShieldstoDonald Trump. All of these images were captured in the 1980s, when Tyson became the youngest-ever heavyweight champion and a bona fide global icon. In a decade that saw the embrace of go-go economics and the emergence of hip-hop, Tyson proved to be the right man for the moment. Styles make fights, but the era makes the fighter. “I can’t imagine him in a different decade,” saidMark Kriegel,a boxing analyst for ESPN and author of biographies onJoe Namath,Ray Mancini,and Pete Maravich. “He couldn’t have come from another age, or he wouldn’t have been Tyson.” In a superb new book,Baddest Man: The Making of Mike Tyson,Kriegel details how Tyson was defined by the ’80s—and vice versa. A former sports columnist for theNew York Daily Newsand theNew York Post,Kriegel qualifies as an authority on the subject. He has covered Tyson for decades, at times in unflattering terms. At thePost,Kriegel admits, Tyson was his “designated bad guy.” His perception of Tyson—much like the general public’s—is far more positive today. “He was my villain. And some of it I was overboard,” Kriegel told me in an interview. “Some of it was shameful. A lot of it was true. But in a peculiar way, as much as I covered him, he was an abstraction to me.” Kriegel spoke to Tyson twice via Zoom forBaddest Man,although he said they were not “interviews per se.” The book, which is due out on Tuesday, charts Tyson’s ascent from his troubled childhood in Brooklyn and tutelage under Cus D’Amato, the legendary boxing manager who served as Tyson’s father figure, to his turbulent marriage withRobin Givens.Baddest Manculminates with Tyson’s 91-second knockout ofMichael Spinksin 1988. (Kriegel said that a second volume, which will delve into the rape trial and Tyson’s incarceration, is in the offing.) The fight doubled as a triumph for Trump—a recurring character throughout the book—who paid $11 million to host the title bout before briefly becoming Tyson’s “adviser.” “I think it’s a central glimpse into Trump’s aspirations,” Kriegel said of the Tyson-Spinks fight, “and what Trump would eventually become.” I spoke to Kriegel by phone this week about what made Tyson a seminal figure of the ’80s, how he’s managed to rehabilitate his image, and why we just can’t quit “Iron” Mike. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Vanity Fair:The public perception of Mike Tyson has shifted seemingly every decade going back 40 years. In the ’80s, he was this prodigious and highly marketable talent. In the ’90s, he became a convicted felon. By the time the millennium arrived, he was a sad and broken figure. And then, from the 2010s onward, he became quite beloved. And so I just wanted to start with a question about his legacy. Fifty years from now, how do you think Mike Tyson should be remembered? Mark Kriegel:Look, what still blows me away more than anything is the idea that he’s (a) still alive, and (b) that he’s managed to prosper. The only thing that people on both sides of the Tyson aisle could agree on—dedicated detractors, as I had been, and apologists, acolytes, lovers, supporters—was that he wasn’t going to be long for this world. As far as his legacy, he certainly was, I think, the most commercially potent fighter. For a time, the most exciting [fighter]. There were certain things he did without precedent: the youngest-ever heavyweight champion, the amount and the type of commerce he generated. All of that was without precedent, and I think will remain without precedent. But there’s a natural arc to a fighter’s career, and usually the third act is the truly tragic one. When the fighter stops fighting, there’s a loss of identity. There’s a loss of income. There’s a sense of shame. To me, nowhere is that communicated more poignantly than inRequiem for a Heavyweightin the scene where Anthony Quinn comes out in Native American headdress as a wrestler. And that’s supposed to connote great shame that he’s busted out. He’s a palooka. And Tyson, unlike anyone ever—and I don’t think this will ever be done again—has turned that trajectory upside down. He went from, in his third act, being the busted out postmodern palooka to being the avatar of bro culture and pretty much universally beloved. No one’s ever done that before. I know people have talked about what a great shame it was that he did this fight withJake Paul.But only Tyson could have generated that kind of money—not just for Jake Paul, but also for Netflix. He is now 58 years old, and Netflix wanted him for thesame reason that HBO wanted himway back in 1985, ’86, ’87. But I think that if I’m really going to do [Tyson’s] legacy, it has to be him becoming the youngest ever heavyweight champion—in an age when being the heavyweight champion was a title that meant something, particularly in America. But it’s also that he turned the normal trajectory of a fighter’s life upside down. And that, to me, is the craziest part of it. He should be dead many times over. He would agree with that. He didn’t imagine seeing 30, 40, 50, much less 60. But here he is: no longer a phenom, no longer a villain. Beloved, even though he hasn’t had a real fight since the early 2000s. That’s without precedent, and I don’t imagine that ever happens again. What do you attribute his image rehabilitation to? I think the biggest thing was he found theright wife. That’s number one. The other thing is, in a peculiar way, he has a sense of humor, and he has an ability to empathize, particularly with other fighters. And people, for a variety of reasons, empathize with him. I can’t speak for everybody, but I can speak for me. Our careers are roughly contiguous. When he was on that first ascent, I was covering cops and courts. I was a general assignment reporter. And then in ’91, by a series of accidents, I became a columnist atThe Post. He was my designated bad guy. He was my villain. And some of it I was overboard. Some of it was shameful. A lot of it was true. But in a peculiar way, as much as I covered him, he was an abstraction to me. It wasn’t until 2012, when I saw his one-man show at the MGM Grand. It was beforeSpike Leegot ahold of it and really spiffed up the production and the storytelling and made it a bona fide Broadway show. So it was still rough and very much a work-in-progress. But I remember it really clearly, and it grabbed at my throat. I had to hold back tears through a good portion of this kind of jagged but endearing performance. There was a consistent pathos that wound all the way through it. To me, Tyson denotes the dawn of tabloid culture. He was evil, he was funny, he was a goof, but he wasn’t real to me until we sat down that day. He wasn’t like a human being to me until I sat down with him after the show. I’m still kind of misty over what he had said, and how confessional and raw it was. I remember telling him about chasing him around through his debacle of a first marriage, and[Tyson’s street fight with]Mitch Green.We didn’t know it at the time, but what we were seeing was a guy coming apart at the seams. And he turns to me and he says, “Well, what was that? How did it make you feel?” And he’s talking about running around in this swirl of this tabloid frenzy. I thought about it and I was like, Shit, all the adrenaline and trying to get on the front page was a form of getting high. And he just kind of looks at me. It wasn’t disapproving. It was a look of recognition. And that was the moment he became human to me. He was no longer an abstraction, and it wasn’t just red meat for the backpage or a way to get me on the front page or whatever the hell it was. He was a real person then. And I think that same sentiment, writ large, is what enabled the transformation of his reputation. Your book covers the allegations of sexual misconduct and abuse that he faced in the ’80s, but it sometimes feels like, as a society, we’ve memory-holed that part of his story. This is a guy who served three years in prison for a rape conviction. He’s been accused of rape by other women (he’s denied the accusations). And yet, as I was watching his fight with Jake Paul last year, I wondered how many young people who tuned in are even aware of that part of Tyson’s biography. Do we need to do a better job of telling the full story? Look, I’ve tried to tell the fullest story and the most contextual story I can up to ’88. I tried to lay it out as honestly and with as much context as I can. Do we need to do a better job educating? I mean, his history’s there. I’m not sure I have an answer for that. I’ll get to the trial in a second volume. I think that, as far as this volume is concerned, Tyson as a kid is both victim and victimizer. The street stuff looms large—not just in his life as a kid, but his entire life. My opinion is that it would’ve been a better, more orderly life for Tyson if someone—namely [Tyson’s managers] Cus D’Amato and Jimmy Jacobs—had said no to him when he was a kid. Cus D’Amato, a truly compelling figure and a truly romantic one, wasn’t doing the normal boxing thing where a coach may help get a kid out of juvenile lockup or help a troubled kid and say, “Hey, listen, we’re going to teach you how to fight. We’re going to put you in the gloves. Maybe one day you’ll be a champ. Maybe we’ll get you a GED.” That wasn’t what this was about. This was, from the beginning, “You’re going to be an immortal champion. You’re going to be a great champion. You’re going to be the youngest ever champion.” And the subtext of that is the D’Amato saying, “You are going to make me live forever, kid.” That’s a lot to put on a 13-year-old. Now, Tyson pushed back pretty vociferously when I raised that with him, and I understand his point that D’Amato saved his life. But by the same token, that’s a pretty unforgiving standard for a 13-year-old kid. And it might sound conceptual to you or me—I'm going to make you the youngest ever heavyweight champion—but it wasn’t to Tyson. Your book closes with one of Tyson’s greatest triumphs, his 91-second knockout of Michael Spinks in 1988. It was also a PR coup for Donald Trump, who bid a record site fee to host the fight in Atlantic City, and who also hosted the Tyson-Larry Holmes fight earlier that same year. I wonder if those fights played a bigger role in the making of Trump than some might realize. Maybe it wasn’t as much of a springboard asThe Apprentice,but he was there alongside all these massive stars, including Muhammad Ali, and garnered a ton of publicity out of it. Are we underselling this part of the Donald Trump biography? I’m not! I think it’s a central glimpse into Trump’s aspirations and what Trump would eventually become.The Art of the Dealcame out in ’87, and Trump, because the PR is so good for the book, is seen as this capitalist sage. But his first foray into sports was the USFL, and that was an unmitigated disaster. Basically, what he does becomesthe death knell for the USFL. And he comes to boxing immediately after this unmitigated failure with the USFL. Now, it wasn’t perceived that way. He was seen, again, as this real estate savant. Whether that’s true or not is an entirely different question. But the press that Trump received then—from the same Manhattan people who despise him now—was universally glowing. So, one of the things [Trump] realizes, or people around him realize, is that when Tyson fights in Atlantic City, the casino drop is several times what it would’ve been on another night. Maybe more. They’re raking in money with the gamblers. He also, in typical Trump fashion, creates a tunnel so that you can go from Trump Plaza, which was his main hotel at the time, directly into the Atlantic City Convention Center, without having to mess around with the street people. So, he understood Tyson as a boon for his casino business. And just as HBO needed [Tyson] to do the same thing that Tony Soprano would for the 18-to-49-year-old male demographic a decade later, Trump needed him in his business as well. Tyson was the piece that would allow Trump and Trump’s Atlantic City to supplant Vegas as the fight capital. I don’t know if it was all Trump. But these are pretty sound business calculations that Trump made around Tyson. Where it gets a little dicey—and it starts right after the book ends—is his short-lived experience as Tyson’s quote-unquote adviser. And I think that it was a great publicity score because you’re dealing with by far the most popular and lucrative athlete in the world, especially after he blows away Spinks. In the book, you described this scene before the Tyson-Spinks fight when Michael Buffer gave this drawn-out introduction of Trump and thanked him for “bringing this great event to Atlantic City.” You also had Tyson and Spinks offering their thanks to “Mr. Trump” in advertisements for the fight. It all sounded reminiscent of his Cabinet meetings, when they all go around and shower him with praise. [laughter] That’s really, really well put. It’s almost like a meeting of House Republicans right now. It’s very much that. And it’s certainly worth noting thatJesse Jacksonis introduced by Buffer as a “friend of Donald Trump.” Everyone’s a friend of Donald Trump at that point. And the way that fight was stage managed, and the pre-fight, and the lavishness that Trump likes to take credit for, and the guest list was like a political convention. There was something a bit Trumpian about the way you described Tyson’s rise in the ’80s. You wrote that his ascent to stardom could be charted in the gossip pages and that his handlers were feeding stories toPage Sixand Liz Smith. I mean, that sounds a lot like Donald Trump. Yeah, that was Trump’s MO, and Trump lusted for that coverage. I can’t say that Tyson lusted to be covered byCindy AdamsorPage Six.He was just hanging out. But where they are unified, if not by design then just by fact, is that decade and that fight was about the money. There’s this guy who I used to cover,Brian “Glaze” Gibbs,who might’ve been the scariest guy in New York at that time in 1988. Those kids, that class of late-’80s gangsters out of Brooklyn and Queens, saw themselves as the most fearless capitalists of all. [Gibbs] remembers that night, and he goes, “Man, Mark. It was beautiful. It was all about the money. You could smell it.” And to me, he nailed it. He got it right. It doesn’t matter if you areCarl Icahnor Donald Trump or Mike Tyson or Butch Lewis or Don King. That night—that decade—was all about the money. Tyson has always struck me as one of the ultimate creatures of the ’80s, and I get the sense that he arrived at the most auspicious time for his career. Boxing was still nationally resonant. The public, as you wrote, was desperate for a charismatic heavyweight champion. And meanwhile, you had this cultural synergy as his ascent coincided with the emergence of hip-hop. Hip-hop was the last piece. That’s the peculiarity. He was marketed at first to white ethnics upstate, and he was sold as a kind of postmodern Jack Dempsey. Not a Sonny Liston. And his handlers would always get really nervous if he said something off-color. They wanted him to be a good guy. He’s going around doing PSAs for the cops, for the FBI. “Just say no.” And he did not feel at all comfortable with that. Larry Merchanttold me that no one really realized what he had. So, you are selling him as the guy your father would’ve rooted for. He has a Jack Dempsey haircut. He’s well-versed in all the boxing lore. In many ways, he’s this extraordinary retro figure, and he has an almost Talmudic understanding of boxing history. So all of that’s really attractive, especially to network executives. But underneath it, there’s a sense that no one wants Floyd Patterson anymore. There was room for a Sonny Liston. In ’87, there’s the first reference to Tyson in a hip-hop lyric. It’sPublic Enemy. So, now there’s this whole other audience. And none of those network executives, or those guys upstate, understood how big hip-hop was going to be, or what Tyson was going to represent in full.Do you think Tyson could have attained the same level of stardom had he emerged in a different decade? I can’t imagine him in a different decade. He couldn’t have come from another age, or he wouldn’t have been Tyson. He might have been something else, but he wouldn’t have been Tyson. I don’t mean to cop out on the question. It’s a good question. But the elements that conspired to make him Tyson—the literary pedigree, cable TV, pay-per-view, then hip-hop—made the attraction we know as Tyson. Those elements didn’t come together in any other decade but the ’80s and the cusp of the ’90s. So I think it was particular to one time, or at least the forces that made him. What still blows me away is that the attraction, what went into the making of him, was so fucking potent that he’s still making 20 million bucks a pop for essentially an exhibition with Jake Paul. And there’s nowhere else Jake Paul can go to make that kind of money. And there’s nowhere else that Netflix can go to generate that kind of heat. We can’t quit Mike Tyson. No, exactly. We cannot quit Mike Tyson. But I mean, to the extent this book works, it explains why we have this never-ending jones for this guy.

    "title": "Surprise: Elon Musk’s Stint in Politics Was Reportedly Fueled by Ketamine, Adderall, Shrooms, and Ecstasy",
    "article_text": "Elon Muskhas done a lot ofweird,offensive,disastrousstuff during his time in politics, and now a new report reveals that, kind of unsurprisingly, the richest man in the world was apparently using a cornucopia of drugs when he inserted himself into the political world. Sources toldThe New York Timesthat when Musk jumped on the campaign trail last year, hewas“using drugs far more intensely than previously known.” Musk, theTimesreports, “told people he was taking so much ketamine, a powerful anesthetic, that it was affecting his bladder, a known effect of chronic use.” He was also reportedly taking ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms, and “traveled with a daily medication box that held about 20 pills, including ones with the markings of the stimulant Adderall, according to a photo of the box and people who have seen it.” While theTimessays it’s not clear if Musk was still on drugs when he started running DOGE and wreaking havoc on the federal government, it sure seems like he might have been, given that his tenure involved “erratic behavior, insulting Cabinet members, gesturing like a Nazi, and garbling his answers in a staged interview.” Neither Musk nor his attorney responded to theTimes’ request for comment; in the past he has said he was prescribed ketamine to treat depression, and took it roughly every two weeks. He also told his biographer, “I really don’t like doing illegal drugs.” Last year,The Wall Street Journalreportedthat Musk has used LSD, ecstasy, cocaine, and mushrooms, and that some executives at his companies were concerned about his drug use. Musk did not respond to theJournal’s request for comment; his attorney told the outlet he is “regularly and randomly drug tested at SpaceX and has never failed a test.” (Sources told theTimesthat while SpaceX, as a government contractor, must remain drug-free and randomly tests its employees, “Musk has received advance warning of the tests, according to people close to the process.”) A lawyer for Musk did not immediately respond toVanity Fair’s request for comment. Sources familiar with Musk’s activities told theTimesthat he “had been using ketamine often, sometimes daily, and mixing it with other drugs,” and “the line between medical use and recreation was blurry, troubling some people close to him.” The outlet also reports that Musk “took ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms at private gatherings across the United States and in at least one other country, according to those who attended the events.” Around the time the world’s richest man is said to have told people his ketamine intake had led to bladder problems, he endorsedDonald Trumpfor president; a few months after that, he appeared with the then candidate at a campaign rally for the first time, where he jumped around on the stage. Musk left the federal government this week after sitting down for a series of interviews in which hecomplainedthat DOGE had become “the whipping boy for everything” and called the burning of Teslas in protest of his work in Washington “really uncool.” Joni Ernst feels pretty zen about proposed cuts to Medicaid This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom.

    "title": "In a World of Dirty Celebrities, Sydney Sweeney Capitalizes on Being Clean",
    "article_text": "Last year,Sydney SweeneytoldVFshe’s made peace with her inability tocontrol her own imageeven as she’s oversexualized by the media, and has to facegeneral misconceptionsabout her success. But the Emmy-nominated actor is also shrewd about using the PR machineto her advantage, like with her latest stunt: selling a men’s soap infused with her very own bathwater. On Thursday, Sweeneyannouncedshe’s partnering with soap brand Dr. Squatch to sell a limited-edition line of bars that includes drops of her actual bathwater. The unorthodox product follows herviral adfor the brand last October, in which Sweeney sits in a bubble bath while speaking to the world’s “dirty little boys.” The 27-year-old toldGQthat she “definitely was not aware” of the erotic interest in bathtub water “until I started seeing it in my own comments” on Instagram. She also credited the 2023 filmSaltburn,in whichBarry Keoghan’s character inhales the filthy bathwater of Sweeney’sEuphoriacostarJacob Elordistraight from the drain, as “a huge catalyst” for a renewed cultural fascination with bathing. But there was another time in the not-too-distant past when celebrity hygiene was an even hotter topic. Back in the summer of 2021, just as both celebs and civilians began to venture out of the house again post-pandemic, a few brave actors proudly flaunted their ability to forego showers. It began withAshton KutcherandMila Kunis, who said onDax ShepardandMonica Padman’sArmchair Expertpodcastthat they rarely bathed themselves or their young children. “If you can see the dirt on them, clean them. Otherwise, there’s no point,” Kutcher argued, adding that he personally suds “my armpits and my crotch daily and nothing else ever.” Kunis, who was born in Russia and lived there until age seven, admitted: “I didn’t have hot water growing up as a child, so I didn’t shower very much anyway.” Shepard and his wife,Kristen Bell,were asked about this interview while appearingonThe View, where they also copped to skipping regular showers for their kids. “I’m a big fan of waiting for the stink,” Bell said. “Once you catch a whiff, that’s biology’s way of letting you know you need to clean it up.” They laterdefendedtheir remarks in another interview, noting that at the time they were dealing with drought in California. “We don’t have a ton of water, so when I shower I’ll grab the girls and push them in there with me so we all use the same shower water,” Bell said. “And I don’t know, it just happens whenever it happens, I guess.” Three is a trend, andJake Gyllenhaalcompleted the grimy trifecta when hetoldVanity Fairthat same week: “More and more I find bathing to be less necessary. I do also think that there’s a whole world of not bathing that is also really helpful for skin maintenance, and we naturally clean ourselves.” All of these dirty little secrets sparked extensive internet discourse.Reductresspoked fun at Gyllenhaal with this headline: “Brave: Another White Person Comes Out as Stinky.” AndCardi Btweeted, “It’s giving itchy.” But for every unwashed celebrity spreading their message, there are those who wisely commodify their own (presumably clean) auras. Just before the world descended into questionable quarantine habits, Grammy-winnerErykah Baduand Oscar winnerGwyneth Paltroweach released products purportedly smelling like their own vaginas. And now Sweeney, who boasted toGQthat she had showered the morning of their interview with her own soap, has continued the tradition. Only 5,000 bars of Sydney’s Bathwater Bliss will be manufactured, each coming with a signed certificate of authenticity and an $8 price tag,when it goes on saleJune 6 at noon ET/9 a.m. PT. Given the limited quantity, Dr. Squatch will also be holding a sweepstakes to give away 100 bars to US residents—who must, for reasons that admittedly feel a little sinister, be over 18 years of age to purchase.

    "title": "The 26 Best Movies on Amazon Prime to Watch Now (June 2025)",
    "article_text": "Only one streaming service lives on a site that will sell you paper towels with no shipping costs: Amazon Prime Video. But while shopping for household goods, you may also wonder, What are the bestmovieson Amazon Prime Video?Vanity Fairis here to help. Truly, there are countless films on Prime Video you can rent for a few bucks—but if you are already an Amazon Prime subscriber, you get access to a ton of free, good movies. There are comedies, horror films, dramas, classics, sexy tennis movies withZendaya(okay, only onesexy tennis moviewith Zendaya), and a lot more. So don’t get stuck holding the remote like a schmuck while your spouse eats all the Häagen-Dazs. Take a look at this curated list and pick something outbeforeyou turn the television on. Director:Carl ReinerGenre:ComedyNotable cast:Steve Martin, Lily Tomlin, Richard LibertiniMPA rating:PGRotten Tomatoes:85%Metacritic:68 For those of us old enough to have seen this in theaters, we’ve been mumbling “put Edwina backinbowl” for 40 years. (It’s been a struggle.) This zany supernatural comedy is probably a little dated in its treatment of Eastern religions, but that hopefully won’t offend you too much when you see everymanSteve Martin’s physical antics after 50% of his body is overtaken by undead zillionaireLily Tomlin.Though this is still a bananas picture, it was the first of Martin’s films that wasn’t just a joke parade likeThe JerkorDead Men Don’t Wear Plaid—an important turn in the road for a great career. Director:John LandisGenre:Horror-comedyNotable cast:David Naughton, Griffin Dunne, Jenny AgutterMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:89%Metacritic:55 “Beware the moon, lads!” The OG horror-comedy,An American Werewolf in Londonremains fur-raisingly scary, genuinely funny, and still a little shocking.David Naughton’s transformation sequence is the gold standard for practical special effects, but don’t forget that little piece of flappy skin onGriffin Dunne’s face in the hospital scene—yeeeeach! The big finish at Piccadilly Circus is a warning to all us Yanks: Never go to England! Director:Paul GreengrassGenre:Action-dramaNotable cast:Tom Hanks, Barkhad Abdi, the seaMPA rating:PG-13Rotten Tomatoes:93%Metacritic:82 Tom Hanksgives one of the best performances of his career (and yet somehow didn’t get an Oscar nom) as the titular Captain Phillips, though social media users are well aware that he is not the captain for the entire duration of this film. (Yes,Paul Greengrass’s nail-biter of a piracy drama is the origin ofthis meme.) This terrifying film will have you thinking twice before you order cheap goods that require international shipping. Director:Luca GuadagninoGenre:Romantic dramaNotable cast:Zendaya, Josh O’Connor, Mike FaistMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:88%Metacritic:82 InChallengers,Zendaya is serving…tennis balls. What did you think I was going to say? This extremely of-the-now relationship drama volleys back and forth in time, but builds to one ace of a finish. And when you know the score, it’s a reallovestory. (I’ll stop now.) Anyhow, betweenLuca Guadagnino’s roaming camera,Trent ReznorandAtticus Ross’s electronica soundtrack, andJosh O’ConnorandMike Faistsharing a churro, this is one of the hottest movies on Prime Video right now. Director:Charlie ChaplinGenre:ComedyNotable cast:Charlie Chaplin, Virginia Cherrill, Harry MyersMPA rating:Not ratedRotten Tomatoes:95%Metacritic:99 If you only know Charlie Chaplin as some dude who twirls a cane in three-second clips about “the magic of the movies,” well, you are in luck. The guy is famous for a reason, and while much of his success came from slapstick moments in short films, he was more than adept at sustaining an entire feature-length narrative.City Lightsstrings together a number of memorable bits (the boxing match! The rich drunk!) but is also a winning romance in which Chaplin’s Tramp (yes, the cane-twirling guy) wins the heart of a blind flower salesgirl played by Virginia Cherrill. Director:Edward BergerGenre:DramaNotable cast:Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci, John LithgowMPA rating:PGRotten Tomatoes:93%Metacritic:79 Intrigue! At the Vatican!Ralph Fiennesleads a group of crimson-robed holy men through a series of surprisingly dishy days and nights while determining who gets to be the next pope. The Holy See soon becomes the Holy I See What You Did, as past scandals are uncovered and men of the cloth maneuver to support their personal faves. Nominated for eight Oscars and winning one for best adapted screenplay,Conclavewill, if nothing else, renew your faith in page-turning “airport novel” cinema. Director:Fred ZinnemannGenre:SuspenseNotable cast:Edward Fox, Michael Lonsdale, Derek JacobiMPA rating:PGRotten Tomatoes:91%Metacritic:80 Back in the old days, when you wanted to assassinate a head of state, you had to do it without Google Maps, cell phones, or those guns that put a little red spot on the guy before you shoot. This is the world of Fred Zinnemann’sThe Day of the Jackal,which is based on a tiny speck of truth (in as much as French nationalists wanted to bump off Charles de Gaulle, and there was a real assassin codenamed the Jackal) and is a flat-out masterpiece of no-nonsense spycraft. Roger Ebert summed it up perfectly by writing that the movie “is two and a half hours long and seems over in about 15 minutes.” Director:Spike LeeGenre:Drama (but also comedy)Notable cast:Spike Lee, Rosie Perez, John TurturroMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:92%Metacritic:93 “20 D Energizers!”Spike Lee’s heat-soaked masterpiece is among the most insightful and socially relevant films of all time, but let’s not forget something: It’s alsoincrediblyfunny, and includes a tidal wave of great performances and zingers that also make this an uncommonly quotable movie. I can personally attest that, for more than 30 years, I’ve been repeating Sal’s “Extra cheese is $2!” and Sweet Dick Willie’s “It ain’t never too hot or never too cold!” whenever the opportunity presents itself. Director:John CarpenterGenre:Action-AdventureNotable cast:Kurt Russell, Isaac Hayes, Adrienne BarbeauMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:86%Metacritic:76 As withRoboCop,it took me a long time to realize there was a satirical side to John Carpenter’sEscape From New York.As a kid, I was convinced that Manhattan Island might any day be transformed into a carceral oubliette, into which maniacal sociopaths would be dropped and left to fend for themselves. Due to some shenanigans in the film, the president of the United States ends up in this horrible place (and this wasbeforecongestion pricing!). Only one man can save him:Kurt Russell’s Snake Plisskin. What follows is an avalanche of nihilistic violence and WWE-style performances from a rogue’s gallery including Isaac Hayes, Ernest Borgnine, and Harry Dean Stanton. Director:Rusty CundieffGenre:ComedyNotable cast: Rusty Cundieff, Kasi Lemmons, Larry B. ScottMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:83%Metacritic:62 One of the best Prime movies for 1990s nostalgia, this mockumentary is one of the great hip-hop comedies, poking fun at the rap trends of the time. (Indeed, it must be noted that there were several stars with “Ice” in their name.) This low-budget picture, inspired byThis Is Spinal Tap,made its Sundance debut just before a bigger-budget rap mockumentary,CB4,hit theaters. While that film had bigger stars, this had (and still has) far more edge to it. Its director and star,Rusty Cundieff,later created theTales From the Hoodseries and directed much ofChappelle’s Show. Director:Terry ZwigoffGenre:ComedyNotable cast:Thora Birch, Scarlett Johansson, Steve BuscemiMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:93%Metacritic:90 Arguably the finest ode to nonconformity on film,Terry Zwigoff’sGhost World, based onDaniel Clowes’s comic books, is a painfully funny look at the transition into adulthood, and measuring just how many of society’s rules one can accept without giving up their identity. Putting it in such clinical terms would surely make Enid roll her eyes and Seymour mutter “ugh,” but that’s why they are forever cooler than we will ever be. Director:Mike NicholsGenre:ComedyNotable cast:Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft, Katharine RossMPA rating:PG (rated upon rerelease)Rotten Tomatoes:87%Metacritic:83 Dustin HoffmanandAnne Bancroftsaw to it that there was no physical generation gap in this counterculture epic by, um, meeting discreetly in hotel rooms. Despite the passage of time, there’s a universality to young Benjamin Braddock’s conundrum of not knowing what the hell he wants to do with his life now that he’s graduated college. (“Plastics” isn’t the answer.)Mike Nichols’s legendary film, with its Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack, had considerably fewer overt political moments in it than many other movies of the era, which is probably why it has lasted so long. Director:Michael GraceyGenre:Circus MusicalNotable cast:Hugh Jackman, Zendaya, Zac EfronMPA rating:PGRotten Tomatoes:56%Metacritic:48 Previous generations could have only dreamt of being able to pick up a remote control, point it at a television, and instantly summonHugh Jackmanon an elephant. But this (meaning our lives right now, in an age of miracles and wonder) is the greatest show! Anyhow: Jackman is marvelous as P.T. Barnum, and the cast includesZendaya(who does a lot of spinning around on a trapeze) andZac Efron(who watches her spin around on a trapeze). Director:Philip KaufmanGenre:Horror-sci-fiNotable cast:Donald Sutherland, Brooke Adams, Leonard NimoyMPA rating:PGRotten Tomatoes:93%Metacritic:92 Watch this if for no other reason than to find out where that GIF of Donald Sutherlandpointing and making a crazy facecomes from. This remake of the 1950s Cold War fright fest is a high-water mark for 1970s permissiveness—there’s alotof gore and nudity for a PG movie here. Also, it certainly gives Leonard Nimoy his best non-Spock role, as a pop psychologist. The central metaphor of “pod people” coming to replace the American public is also vague enough to suit all political paranoias. Director:Godfrey ReggioGenre:ExperimentalNotable cast:The planet EarthMPA rating:Not ratedRotten Tomatoes:91%Metacritic:72 This art house mainstay is still revolutionary in its craftsmanship and hesitancy to explain itself.Godfrey Reggio,a former monk/social activist/political advertising man, collaborated with tech-forward cinematographerRon Frickeand celebrated composerPhilip Glassto makeKoyaanisqatsi,a portrait of the natural world and its human inhabitants living in a weirdly beautiful disharmony. (The title means “Life out of Balance” in the Hopi language.) No one had ever seen such a collection of images put to music quite like this before—and Reggio’s style was immediately seized upon by Madison Avenue, making this one of the most influential pictures of the late 20th century. It’s also never boring despite it having no dialogue or plot. A great one to stream during a late night. Director:Sofia CoppolaGenre:DramaNotable cast:Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson, Giovanni RibisiMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:95%Metacritic:91 I dunno about you, but whenever I’m bored at a hotel, it’s never as glamorous as this. (I’m usually trying to figure out how the thermostat works.)Sofia Coppolafamously conceived of her breakout film not by creating a typical screenplay, but by writing short paragraphs reflecting on time spent in Tokyo, envisioningBill Murrayin the main role. It then tookher a yearto get him to agree to be in the film—opposite a 17-year-oldScarlett Johansson. Director:Regina KingGenre:DramaNotable cast:Kingsley Ben-Adir, Leslie Odom Jr., Eli Goree, Aldis HodgeMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:98%Metacritic:83 Four Black men on the verge of changing the world—Sam Cooke, Jim Brown, Malcolm X, and Muhammad Ali (still known as Cassius Clay)—meet in a hotel room in 1963 to examine the roads that lie ahead for them. Based on a speculative play by Kemp Powers that is in turn based ona true meetup, Regina King’s film adaptation offers the floor tofour powerhouse performers. Leslie Odom Jr. is particularly effective as Sam Cooke in a musical sequence. Director:Christopher NolanGenre:DramaNotable cast:Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Florence PughMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:93%Metacritic:90 The only Academy Award winner for best picture about a guy who slowly gets an all-access pass taken away from him. Okay, that’s not whatOppenheimeris really about, but the eggheads at Los Alamos were all about breaking things down to their component parts. Anyway, for all ofChristopher Nolan’s love of enormous IMAX cameras and the theatrical experience, this movie still comes together like clockwork when streaming on Prime Video. Director:John SaylesGenre:DramaNotable cast:Mary McDonnell, Alfre Woodard, David StrathairnMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:100%Metacritic:Not listed In the late 1980s and early 1990s,John Sayleswas pumping out brilliant, literate, funny, and emotional independent films at a regular clip—andPassion Fishmight be the best of the bunch. It starsMary McDonnellas a soap opera star who moves back to Louisiana after a traffic accident leaves her paralyzed. While wallowing in self-pity, she bonds with a nurse,Alfre Woodard,the only caregiver who doesn’t quit because she has no other options open to her.David Strathairncostars as a local fisherman. In a parallel universe, this is the most famous movie of the 1990s, because it’s absolutely fantastic. Director:Martin BrestGenre:ComedyNotable cast:Al Pacino, Chris O’Donnell, WomenMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:85%Metacritic:57 “Hoo-ah!”Al Pacinomade the full transformation into “Loud Al” with this sleeper success from directorMartin Brest.In it, he plays an ornery, blind, retired army colonel who starts palling around with a prep school student (Chris O’Donnell), teaching him how tolive,how totruly live.(UnlikeZorba the Greek,it does not involve dancing on the sand, but there are other commonalities.) This is definitely a movie from another time, but if you ignore the occasionally creaky sexual politics and instead focus on the outstanding New York City location photography, you may find yourself having a good time. It won Pacino his first acting Oscar after seven nominations. Director:Ang LeeGenre:DramaNotable cast:Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, Hugh GrantMPA rating:PGRotten Tomatoes:97%Metacritic:84 The first of Jane Austen’s six major novels, adapted at a time when the author’s work had finally been freed from soporificMasterpiece Theatreassociations. DirectorAng Leeand screenwriterEmma Thompson, who also stars in the film, deliver a fast-paced, funny, and juicy version with a whole lot of romping around the countryside, getting caught in the rain, swooning, weeping, and making ever so many witty remarks. Director:David FincherGenre:DramaNotable cast:Jessie Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Justin TimberlakeMPA rating:PG-13Rotten Tomatoes:96%Metacritic:95 DirectorDavid Fincherand screenwriterAaron Sorkin’s ballad of the tech bro is arguably the quintessential film of its era, detailing the Wild West of new internet wealth. Yes, Facebook got people back in touch with their lost high school chums, but was it worth making these immature, hoodie-wearing dweebs zillionaires? Hit “like” if you have thoughts. Director:Richard AyoadeGenre:ComedyNotable cast:Craig Roberts, Sally Hawkins, Paddy ConsidineMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:88%Metacritic:76 One of the great, somewhat forgotten recent quirky teen romance films,Richard Ayoade’sSubmarinecould be reductively described as a “BritishRushmore,” but…is that such a bad thing? It has a similar snappy style of editing and production design, as well as a delightful, youthful melancholy. The soundtrack includes six original songs byAlex Turnerof the Arctic Monkeys, which may give you a good idea of what you are in for here. Director:Eugene AsheGenre:Romantic dramaNotable cast:Tessa Thompson, Nnamdi Asomugha, Regé-Jean PageMPA rating:PG-13Rotten Tomatoes:94%Metacritic:74 This terrific early-’60s-set Harlem melodrama is a tender and witty look at the worlds of jazz and, uh, early cooking shows, with lavish sets, costumes, and production design. It’s also just charming as hell to watchTessa ThompsonandNnamdi Asomughaflirt, fall in love, suffer setbacks, yearn for one another, and then…live happily ever after? Well, I’m not gonna spoil it; you need to watch for yourself. Director:Seth MacFarlaneGenre:Action-AdventureNotable cast:Mark Wahlberg, Mila Kunis, TedMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:69%Metacritic:62 What’s funnier than a Boston dirtbag? A Boston dirtbag that’s also a teddy bear.Ted,from the frequently annoyingSeth MacFarlane,is a cavalcade of inappropriate jokes that, in the safety of your own home, you can respond to as your heart desires, with no fear of shame. (There’s a bit in here about the stuffed animal’s tag that is simultaneously adorable and shocking.) The ending may drag on a little long, and all the stuff aboutFlash Gordonoverstays its welcome, but just because you start streamingTedwhile cracking a brewski doesn’t mean you need to finish it. It’s still pretty damn funny. Director:Barbra StreisandGenre:Drama-musicalNotable cast:Barbra Streisand, Mandy Patinkin, Amy IrvingMPA rating:PGRotten Tomatoes:69%Metacritic:68 “What kind of creature are you???” “I’m just a woman!!!”Barbra Streisand’s ahead-of-its-time masterpiece currently enjoys the critical respect it deserves, though it got something of a (sexist) cold shoulder upon its release. (Look at those middling critic scores: ashanda!) This marvelous film, in which a bright young woman must go undercover as a man to study religion, boasts romance, comedy, searing drama, and even some great musical numbers. There’s never been another movie quite likeYentl. The most-viewed movie on Amazon Prime is the remake ofRoad House,believe it or not. Right now, withDie Hardis doing big numbers, probably because we just made it through Christmas. I didn't include on the list just because I want to give that movie a rest for a little while. According to IMDb, the 10 most popular series on Prime areThe Boys, Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan,The Man in the High Castle,The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,The Grand Tour,Bosch,Carnival Row,Paatal Lok,Goliath,andUpload.",

    "title": "Brad Pitt Doesn’t Think Divorce From Angelina Jolie Is “That Major of a Thing”",
    "article_text": "For years,Angelina JolieandBrad Pittwere a Hollywood power couple who worked together both on and off-screen. So when the news of their separation came to lightin 2016, the world froze for a few moments. Onlookers hoped, at least, that the breakup would be amicable—but we soon learned that it was just the beginning of alegal battlethat would last eight stormy years. The divorce was not finalized until December 2024. But in a recentinterview withGQ,Pitt downplayed the importance of that milestone. When asked if he felt relief after finally finalizing the divorce, his answer was blunt. “No, I don’t think it was that major of a thing,” the Oscar winner said. “Just something coming to fruition. Legally.” In 2017, Jolie broke her silence to tellVanity Fairhow she washandling the split. “I’ve been trying for nine months to be really good at just being a homemaker and picking up dog poop and cleaning dishes and reading bedtime stories. And I’m getting better at all three,” she said in a cover story, adding that this had been “the hardest time” for her family. At the same time, said Jolie, she and Pitt were both trying to navigate the aftermath in a healthy way. “We care for each other and care about our family, and we are both working towards the same goal,” she said. When the couple finally reached a legal settlement late last year,James Simon,the actress’s lawyer, spoke toPeoplemagazineabout the toll that the battle had taken on his client. “More than eight years ago, Angelina filed for divorce from Mr. Pitt,” he said. “She and the children left all of the properties they had shared with Mr. Pitt, and since that time she has focused on finding peace and healing for their family. This is just one part of a long ongoing process that started eight years ago. Frankly, Angelina is exhausted, but she is relieved this one part is over.” Pitt, meanwhile, declined to comment until now, perhaps because he’s spent decades under a media microscope. “My personal life is always in the news,” he toldGQ.“It’s been in the news for 30 years, bro. Orsome versionof my personal life, let’s put it that way.” And Pitt has not enjoyed that. “It’s been an annoyance I’ve had to always deal with in different degrees, large and small, as I do the things I really want to do,” he continued. “So it’s always been this kind of nagging time suck or waste of time, if you let it be that, I don’t know. I don’t know. Mostly I feel pretty…. My life is fairly contained. It feels pretty warm and secure with my friends, with my loves, with my fam, with my knowledge of who I am, that, you know, it’s like this fly buzzing around a little bit.” Original story inVFEspaña.",

    "title": "The 22 Best Movies on Hulu to Watch Right Now (June 2025)",
    "article_text": "Each night, you look into your lover’s eyes and ask, “Will no legacy media outlet tell me about the best movies on Hulu?” Luckily,Vanity Fairis here for you. One glance at the platform’s A-to-Z listing reveals that there are almosttoo manygood movies on Hulu to choose from, and it can become a chore to figure out which to choose. After a deep dive into the Hulu archive (the Hu-chive?), we’ve selected a top mix of classics, comedies, dramas, horror pictures, documentaries, and, importantly, a few titles that got overlooked upon their initial release. Our list is in alphabetical order, so you gotta scroll close to the bottom to get toY Tu Mamá También.Hu loves ya? Director:James MangoldGenre:Drama/MusicalNotable Cast:Timothée Chalamet, Monica Barbaro, Elle Fanning, Edward NortonMPA Rating:RRotten Tomatoes:82%Metacritic:70 The mercurial Minnesota-born Robert Zimmerman, best known to humanity andthe Swedish AcademyasBob Dylan,gets as good a straightforward musical biopic as the genre allows inA Complete Unknown.Timothée Chalametnails the nasal twang and aloof demeanor of the musician as he transitions from politically relevant folk music to electric rock and roll. While there’s plenty in the movie that ispure Hollywood, it captures the essence of the Dylan phenomenon, and how the transformation affected colleagues likeJoan Baezand Pete Seeger, as well as his romantic life. Director:Ridley ScottGenre:Sci Fi/HorrorNotable Cast:Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerrit, John Hurt, Veronica CartwrightMPA Rating:RRotten Tomatoes:93%Metacritic:89 The original and still the best. A haunted house story, a workplace drama, and a twist-filled mystery—all set in outer space. Sigourney Weaver’s rocket to superstardom started here when she played the greatest interplanetaryfinal girl, and John Hurt’s legendary tummy ache was a milestone for practical special effects. Several (not all!) of the sequels and prequels to this movie are good, but no matter how many times you’ve seenAlien, you will always find something new in it. Director:Gina Prince-BythewoodGenre:Romantic dramaNotable cast:Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Nate Parker, Minnie DriverMPA rating:PG-13Rotten Tomatoes:83%Metacritic:73 A classic showbiz romance updated for today (or 2014, but that’s close enough), withGugu Mbatha-Rawas an R&B/pop sensation trapped by fame andNate Parkeras the hunky police officer/would-be politician who first saves her life, then takes her heart. This is glossy soap opera filmmaking at its finest, with an extended sequence at a beachside hideaway that may have you hitting pause and heading to Travelocity. One of the better romantic movies to watch on Hulu. Director:Damien ChazelleGenre:ComedyNotable cast:Margot Robbie, Brad Pitt, Jean SmartMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:57%Metacritic:61 Okay this recent big swing fromLa La Land'sDamien Chazelleis mostly remembered for being an awards and box office dud, but if ever there were a project meant for a streaming reevaluation it's something likeBabylon. This jaundiced look at the early years of Hollywood opens with aGarden of Earthly Delights-like party and concludes with a frenzied montage summarizing the history of cinema. At well over three hours, it doesn't all work, but a lot of it—likeMargot Robbie's spunky Nellie LeRoy zooted up on cocaine—is charming. (The defecating elephant, less so.) Director:Penny MarshallGenre:ComedyNotable cast:Tom Hanks, Elizabeth Perkins, Robert LoggiaMPA rating:PGRotten Tomatoes:98%Metacritic:73 Tom Hanks romping around New York City as a wide-eyed 12-year-old in an adult's body inBigis one of the great entries in the 1980s “wonderment” canon. (Tidbit:Steven Spielberg's younger sisterAnneco-wrote the script, so if you've ever caught an Amblin vibe from this, you aren't nuts.) Even back in 1988 the “wait, so did they sleep together” moment was a little weird, and now simply checking reddit for fan theories gets you on an FBI list. Also maybe the whole mystical Zoltar machine has the taint of antiziganism. Hopefully neither consideration will prevent you from rewatching. It's something of a miracle there hasn't yet been a dreadful Hollywood remake or legacy-sequel. Director:Matt JohnsonGenre:ComedyNotable cast:Jay Baruchel, Glenn Howerton, Michael IronsideMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:97%Metacritic:78 Canadian indie stalwartMatt Johnson,creator of marvelous mockumentaries likeThe Dirties,Operation Avalanche,andNirvanna the Band the Show,tackles the rise and fall of the once ubiquitous titular tech gadget in this hilarious boardroom comedy.Jay Baruchelis particularly spectacular as a brilliant and creative inventor pulled between his desire for perfection andGlenn Howerton’sincreasingly antic pursuit of money. Research shows there’s a great deal that’s been fictionalized here, but theessenceof IPO bubbles remains sincere. Director:Doug LimanGenre:Sci-Fi/ActionNotable cast:Tom Cruise, Emily BluntMPA rating:PG-13Rotten Tomatoes:91%Metacritic:71 Do you like watching people memorize things? If so, I have the movie for you.Tom Cruisestars in this exceedingly entertaining science-fiction action film that can best be described asGroundhog DaymeetsAlien.Cruise’s Major William Cage transforms from selfish to savior after living and dying countless times, thanks to some interplanetary goo that sends his consciousness around in loops. Luckily, he’s also a mechsuit-ready warrior teamed up with the only woman who a) believes him and b) has similar skills to save mankind. Video game filmmaking at its finest. Directors:Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy ChinGenre:DocumentaryNotable Cast:Alex Honnold, El CapitanMPA Rating:PG-13Rotten Tomatoes:97%Metacritic:83 Free Solois a great movie to stream on Hulu because if you watch it in a theater, they may throw you out for gasping, moaning, and shouting, “Are younuts?!?!”Alex Honnold(who didnotdie, to paraphraseGonzo the Great) is a professional meshuggeneh who climbs the sides of mountains with no safety gear, because I guess the world isn’t terrifying enough. It is a fascinating and riveting portrait. Director:Wes AndersonGenre:Comedy (for the most part)Notable cast:Ralph Fiennes, F. Murray Abraham, Saoirse RonanMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:92%Metacritic:88 The Grand Budapest Hotelis a rich and remarkable film that showcases all ofWes Anderson’s unique talents. It’s a story within a story within a story (and maybe one more? I should watch it again on Hulu…) that seems, at first, like a delicate puff pastry, but eventually sours as the clicking boots of history muddy up our reveries of the past. The cast is ludicrously packed, butRalph Fiennesis at his madcap best in the center of it all—part Jerry Lewis, part Cary Grant. Director:Karyn KusamaGenre:HorrorNotable cast:Megan Fox, Amanda Seyfried, J.K. SimmonsMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:46%Metacritic:47 Pay no attention to those low critic scores. (Or if you do, search my name and see that I was always on the right side of history.) This teen supernatural horror-comedy, scripted byDiablo Codynot long after she won an Oscar forJunoand createdUnited States of Tara,was shrugged aside at the time of its release, but it’s now been fully embraced as a sharp critique of exploitation tropes and a modern spin on feminism (as well as a win for bisexual representation). That doesn’t mean it’s a college lecture:Jenniferstill has plenty of guts and gore, zingy dialogue, and music by Florence + the Machine, Panic! at the Disco, and other groups of the era. Director:Christopher NolanGenre:Science fictionNotable cast:Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Matt DamonMPA rating:PG-13Rotten Tomatoes:73%Metacritic:74 On the one hand, this movie about black holes, relativistic space travel, and “the problem of gravity” has a stamp of approval from theoretical physicistKip Thorne.But it also hits hardest when we watch space cowboyMatthew McConaugheycry about missing his kids. It hits second-hardest when brave planet-hopping warriorMatt Damonrealizes he lacks the fortitude to face true isolation. Humanity, it’s a puzzle!Christopher Nolandoes all he can to take these very simple emotions and tie them up in all kinds of crazy wormholes and tesseracts (and set them to what is arguablyHans Zimmer’s best score). This film is a miracle. Directors:Colin Cairnes and Cameron CairnesGenre:HorrorNotable cast:David Dastmalchian, Laura Gordon, Ian BlissMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:97%Metacritic:72 This very funny and deeply scary breakout festival hit is a clever spin on the found-footage genre. Presented as a mock investigation into “what really happened” during the live broadcast of a ’70s talk show that went haywire, the film largely plays out like a night of amusing Halloween-themed TV that, naturally, conjures up dark forces to deadly ends. If you’ve ever wondered howJohnny Carsonwould have handled a demon on his couch, look no further. Director:Jonathan LynnGenre:ComedyNotable Cast:Joe Pesci, Marisa Tomei, Ralph MacchioMPA Rating:RRotten Tomatoes:85%Metacritic:68 The most righteous ofall best-supporting-actress Oscar winners,Marisa Tomeirevolutionized outer-borough representation with her sharp, sassy, and sexy performance as auto enthusiast Mona Lisa Vito. Her fiancé, a dopey personal injury attorney played byJoe Pesci,must decamp from Brooklyn to Alabama to rescue two unjustly accused nice guys, and tell a whole lotta jokes along the way. An added (and unexpected) benefit of the film is that trial litigatorslist itas one of the top movies that actually shows courtroom proceedings in a factual light. Director:Rob ReinerGenre:ComedyNotable cast:Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin, Wallace ShawnMPA rating:PGRotten Tomatoes:96%Metacritic:78 Feel you've seen this one too many times already? Inconceivable! More to the point, perhaps there is a young child in your life feeling a little under the weather who could use a tale of chivalry and sorcery as a pick-me-up? Streaming services are awash in high fantasy series, but none of them have the wit and verve of this late ‘80s cross-generational classic. Sure, this is a comedy, butMandy Patinkin’s final act of vengeance against his late father works as drama because you care so much about the characters. Cameos from Andre the Giant, Peter Cook andCarol Kane, plusMark Knopfler's original music, sweeten the package. Director:Jesse EisenbergGenre:Comedy-dramaNotable cast:Jesse Eisenberg, Kieran Culkin, Jennifer GreyMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:96%Metacritic:86 Writer-director-starJesse Eisenbergwas inspired to makeA Real Painafter an actual visit he made to the former home of a beloved family member who grew up in Poland. He andKieran Culkinplay very different cousins who make the trip and philosophize in settings that see-saw from the gorgeous to the unthinkable. Culkin’s role as an annoying-yet-lovable extrovert is an extraordinary example of “the part he was born to play,” and the actor is well deserving of the praise he has received for his magical performance. Director:Jonathan DemmeGenre:DramaNotable cast:Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, Mamie GummerMPA rating:PG-13Rotten Tomatoes:65%Metacritic:54 On paper, there’s nothing special aboutRicki and the Flash.It’s another movie about a family in crisis, trying to patch up old wounds. But it starsMeryl Streep,her actual daughterMamie Gummer,and others (like a youngSebastian Stan!)—and, most importantly, it was directed by Jonathan Demme in peak humanist form. (Sadly, this was his last narrative feature.) Streep’s Ricki Rendazzo (real name Linda) walked away from her life to become the nextBonnie Raitt,but she actually earns her living bagging groceries. A wedding-slash-reunion won’t fix the past, but it might start to pave a new future—and the film’s big concert finish proves that no one could capture the cinematic possibilities of live music performances quite like Demme. Director:Jim SharmanGenre:MusicalNotable cast:Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon, Meat LoafMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:80%Metacritic:65 Yes, yes: If ever there were a motion picture that was meant for the theater, it’sThe Rocky Horror Picture Show,with its shadows cast and talk-backs. But maybe you want to have a smaller version of the experience in the intimacy of your own home? (Whatever couldthatlead to?) However, in addition to being reminded of the B-movie tropes and LGBTQ+ themes, you must be forewarned: A rewatch of this film meansRichard O’Brien’s enduring songs (“Over at the Frankenstein Place” being my favorite) will get stuck in your head and simply never leave. Director:Jan de BontGenre:Action-adventureNotable cast:Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock, Dennis HopperMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:95%Metacritic:78 ThisKeanu Reeves–led hit is such a classic work that a young person watchingDie Hardmight describe that film as “Speedin a skyscraper.”Dennis Hopperis the world’s most high-concept terrorist, strapping a bomb to a bus that will explode should it go slower than 50 miles per hour. Why would he do this? How would he do this? More importantly, how can wethankhim for doing this? Reeves, a determined cop, teams up withSandra Bullock,who moves from passenger to hero in just 116 minutes. Step on it. Director:QuestloveGenre:DocumentaryNotable cast:The 5th Dimension, Stevie Wonder, Mahalia JacksonMPA rating:PG-13Rotten Tomatoes:99%Metacritic:96 The ubiquity of cell phone cameras and the internet means that what happened with the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival could never happen again. I don’t mean there couldn’t be a great and meaningful celebration of music—I mean that it couldn’t almost beforgottenthanks to poor archiving. Luckily,Questlovemade the effort to unearth this important milestone in Black culture, and this reflection/celebration, which does not skimp on the footage, became an Academy Award–winning documentary. Director:Sean BakerGenre:DramaNotable cast:Kitana Kiki Rodriguez, Mya Taylor, James RansoneMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:96%Metacritic:86 For many, this was the film that broughtAnoradirectorSean Bakerto their attention; a delirious, warts-and-all portrait of transgender sex workers in Los Angeles. It was shot on a minuscule budget, using three iPhone 5S cameras with then cutting-edge enhancement apps and Steadicam rigs. This lent itself nicely to Baker’s documentary-inclined sensibilities, while his artistic eye shined through the common “cell phone” format. Finding beauty among the downtrodden, which is inherent to the script, is reflected in the look of the movie itself. It’s a groundbreaking work. Director:Martin ScorseseGenre:Drama (but also comedy)Notable cast:Leonardo DiCaprio, Margot Robbie, Jonah HillMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:79%Metacritic:75 If you don’t believe in time travel, just dial upThe Wolf of Wall Streeton Hulu and see how three hours can zip by in 20 minutes.Martin Scorsese’s satiric take on gutter capitalism is a dizzying whirl of bad behavior. WatchLeonardo DiCaprioromp around his Long Island mansion with his fast cars and drugs snorted from surprising locations, and wait for his inevitable downfall. This is the movie that made Margot Robbie an international sensation, but also reminded us thatJonah Hill(andRob Reiner!) are clutch supporting characters. Director:Alfonso CuarónGenre:DramaNotable cast:Gael García Bernal, Diego Luna, Maribel VerdúMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:90%Metacritic:89 This Spanish-language romantic drama introduced international audiences toAlfonso Cuarón,Gael García Bernal,andDiego Luna,all in one heady, lusty swoop.Y Tu Mamá Tambiénfollows two sexually ripe young men who have their first adult affairs—with the same older woman. The three take a road trip, that most liberating of cinematic forms, and ride it until, eventually, the wheels come off. The journey, however, will provide memories for a lifetime. Did you not just read the list? I spent hours on this damn thing. Yes, there are many good movies on Hulu right now. WatchDead Poets Societyif you want to cry orQuiz Ladyif you want to laugh. I don’t know what you mean. The one with the most streams? Probably something for morons. My number one is probably an epic likeFord v Ferrari. It’s gotta beThe Rocky Horror Picture Show,especially if you dress up. When was the last time you saw it? What, youneversaw it?!!? Correct that now. Boy, you’ve really got a hang-up about “number one,” don’t you? Do you have to go to the bathroom or something? Anyway, the scariest movie on Hulu right now isThe Host.

    "title": "Everything to Know About the Tony Awards 2025",
    "article_text": "Dust off your tap shoes and limber up those jazz hands: TheTony Awards 2025are almost here. The Tonys, which honor the best of American theater and Broadway, are not just an opportunity to show off how cultured you might be (you sawHamiltonat the Public, weknow) and to test your vocal range against glass-shattering soprano performances, but also, in a year fraught with political tension, especially where it comes tofunding for the arts,there are sure to be some powerful statements. This year’s audience is sure to be starry: There will be Broadway legends, sure, likeAudra McDonald, whose six career Tonys make her the winningest performance in the awards’ history, but Hollywood A-listers likeGeorge Clooney,nominated for his Broadway debut this year inGood Night, and Good Luckwill suit up for the night.Sarah Snook,Kieran Culkin,Nick Jonas,Sadie Sink,Nicole Scherzinger,Bob Odenkirk,Denzel Washington,Jake Gyllenhaal,and more also treaded the boards in Midtown this year—even if you don’t know your stage left from your house right, the Tonys will likely have a few familiar faces. Whether you’re ready to rush the stage door post-show, or you just like statuettes andblack-tie attire,here’s everything you need to know about the Tony Awards 2025. The Tony Awards is the annual gala where the American Theatre Wing and the Broadway League dole out American theater’s highest honors, formally known as the Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Broadway Theatre. Perry, the awards’ namesake, was more commonly known as Tony and, before her death in 1946, was a stage actor, producer, and director who cofounded the American Theatre Wing. The first Tony Awards were held in her honor in 1947. Broadway productions that opened between April 26, 2024, and April 27, 2025, are eligible to be nominated. This year, the Tonys have 26 competitive categories. This year’s Tonys will be held on June 8, 2025, at 8 p.m. Eastern. The ceremony will take place at New York City’s Radio City Music Hall. The Tonys will be aired live on CBS, and streamed on Paramount+. Additionally, first-time Tony nomineeDarren Crissand Tony winnerRenée Elise Goldsberrywill host a pre-showcalledThe Tony Awards: Act Onebeginning at 6:40 p.m. Eastern. The pre-show will stream on Pluto TV and conclude at 8, when the awards begin. Cynthia Erivo, who won the 2016 Tony for best leading actress in a musical for her performance inThe Color Purple, and who costars as her royal green-ness, Elphaba, in the two-part movie adaptation ofWicked, will play master of ceremonies at this year\u0000’s honors. An exciting mix of Broadway veterans and new faces areup for this year’s top honors,and the subjects of the nominated shows are just as eclectic as the performers who brought them to life. For example, the best musical category pits the artsy jukebox creationBuena Vista Social ClubagainstDeath Becomes Her, based on the camp classic film of the same name;Dead Outlaw, which costars a corpse;Maybe Happy Ending, which explores the human condition through a pair of retired robots; andOperation Mincemeat, a comedy about a wacky—and real—British intelligence scheme during World War II that will also make any audience member with a heart weep at a ballad about dictating a fake letter performed by a cast member in full secretarial drag. Cole Escola, who has taken the theater and fashion worlds by storm, is nominated for both their lead performance as a fully wasted, hysterical Mary Todd Lincoln inOh, Mary!, and in the overall best play category. The show also scooped up a supporting actor nomination forConrad Ricamora(an aggrieved and crafty Abraham Lincoln), as well as recognition in directing and costume design (still holding out hope for a hoop-skirt-specific special honor—it deserves it). George Clooneyis both established and a Broadway newbie: He’s nominated for lead actor in a play against Escola for his Broadway debut inGood Night, and Good Luck, as well asDaniel Dae KiminYellow Face.Mia Farrowgot a leading actress nod forThe Roommate, as did Sadie Sink in the buzzyJohn Proctor Is the Villain,and Sarah Snook, who has wowed with a one-woman production ofThe Picture of Dorian Gray. If reviews are anything to go by, marveling at her high-energy performance never gets old. Audra McDonald, nominated for best leading actress in a musical for the title role in the latest revival ofGypsy, is already the winningest actor in Tonys history, but, hey, bet she wouldn’t say no to another. See thefull list of this year’s Tony nomineeshere. While most of the performances for the 2025 Tonys remain under wraps, we do know that theoriginal Broadway cast ofHamiltonwill reunite and performduring the show to celebrate 10 years since the musical opened on Broadway. The show still holds the record for the most-nominated musical in Tonys history, boasting 16 nods in 2016. It ultimately won 11 awards, falling just short of the record held byThe Producers, which won 12. Typically, nominees in the best musical category will perform a song from their shows during the ceremony, and with powerhouses Criss and Goldsberry hosting theAct Onepre-show, it would be a crime to stop them from belting. The ceremony is scheduled for a three-hour runtime, ending at 11 p.m. Eastern. There will be no intermission, so prepare accordingly.

    "article_text": "Teachers and classmates of secondary school student to be screened for contagious disease after he left hospital against medical advice Hong Kong health authorities have issued an isolation order for an 18-year-old student diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and arranged screening for his teachers and classmates after he was earlier discharged from hospital against medical advice. The Centre for Health Protection said on Friday it had been following up on the case of a male secondary school student who was admitted to hospital on May 14 due to shortness of breath, persistent coughing, blood in his sputum, fever and weight loss. He was confirmed to have TB. Authorities said the patient, who had not received the Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine as recommended by the Hong Kong Childhood Immunisation Programme, was discharged against medical advice on May 25. He was referred to the Chest Clinic for follow-up as he needed to continue directly observed treatment, but he received insufficient treatment and did not attend the other appointments as scheduled. Despite repeated reminders from clinic medical staff, he finally received a short course of anti-TB treatment. Undergoing only brief treatment can worsen the infection and increase the risk of transmission, posing a public health threat, according to authorities. Treating the contagious disease usually takes at least six months, according to the Department of Health. “Given the above, the [centre] issued an isolation order today [Friday] and the patient was taken to Princess Margaret Hospital for isolation and treatment,” it said.",

    "article_text": "Young oncologist who died had traces of rare rotavirus, rather than previously thought Shiga toxin-producing E coli A trio of suspected gastroenteritis cases at a Hong Kong hospital earlier this year, in which the death of a young doctor prompted concerns of an outbreak of a highly toxic strain ofE coli,were unrelated, health authorities have found. The Centre for Health Protection also said in revealing the outcome of its investigation on Friday that the young oncologist who died had traces of a certain kind of rotavirus, rather than the previously thought Shiga toxin-producingE coli(STEC), but that his cause of death was “uncertain”. An expert from the investigating team suggested it was the first time that a particular group of the rotavirus had been detected in Hong Kong, but there was no evidence of a community outbreak. The death of the young doctor at Princess Margaret Hospital in February prompted concerns that an outbreak of the toxic strain had emerged after it was found in the stool sample of one of the doctors who suffered milder symptoms. “Based on the available information, the [centre] confirmed that there was no STEC outbreak in the oncology department of [the hospital] and that there was no linkage between the illnesses of the three doctors,” it said. The investigation, which included an expert team from the department of microbiology at the University of Hong Kong (HKU), found that a stool sample of the doctor who was suspected of having a STEC infection did not grow “viable” bacteria of the infectious strain.",

    "title": "Hong Kong to impose new emission caps on local power plants from 2030",
    "article_text": "Authorities to further cut annual allowances for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and respirable suspended particulates by up to 25 per cent Hong Kong environmental authorities will impose new emission caps on power plants from 2030 in a bid to further improve local air quality, with a major electricity firm pledging to import more zero-carbon energy from mainland China. The Environment and Ecology Bureau said on Friday that it would further cut the electricity sector’s annual emission allowances for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and respirable suspended particulates (RSPs). In five years, the allowances would be reduced by 19 per cent, 25 per cent and 14 per cent, respectively, it said. The reductions will translate into 2,302 tonnes of sulphur dioxide, 8,350 tonnes of nitrogen oxides and 317 tonnes of RSPs, according to the 10th Technical Memorandum for the Allocation of Emission Allowances, which outlines the emission caps. The bureau said the new caps were decided after considering factors such as the local electricity demand, the gas-fired electricity generation of the city’s two main power companies, the emission performance of existing generating units, the estimated import amount for nuclear power and clean energy, and the projected electricity intake from renewable energy sources. The city’s two main suppliers are HK Electric, which provides power to Hong Kong Island, and CLP Power, which covers Kowloon and the New Territories.",
