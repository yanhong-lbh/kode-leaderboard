    "article_text": "Louisiana police on Tuesday announced a new murder charge against the suspect in the Feb. 5 death of a Super Bowl reporter in a suburb of New Orleans, as well as new accusations against an alleged accomplice. A second person has been charged withsecond-degree murderfollowing the death of a Super Bowl reporter who was covering the major sporting event in early February in New Orleans. Adan Manzano, a 27-year-old Kansas City, Missouri-based Telemundosports reporter, was in New Orleans on assignment to cover the Super Bowl when he was found dead in his room with Xanax in his system at the Comfort Suites hotel in Kenner, Louisiana. At the time, officials said his death was caused by the combined toxic effects of Xanax and alcohol. They noted he was found \"face-down in a pillow with no lividity around his nose and mouth.\" Police arrested and charged 45-year-old Danette Colbert two days after Manzano's body was found. Colbert was nicknamed the \"Bourbon Street Hustler\" on social media, after she racked up several fugitive and fraud charges and a robbery charge in connection with his death. Colbert was also charged with second-degree murder. Rickey White, her alleged accomplice, was also arrested in relation to the incident on charges of simple robbery and several counts of fraud. LOUISIANA POLICE ANNOUNCE UPDATE IN 'BOURBON STREET HUSTLER' CASE AFTER SUPER BOWL REPORTER'S DRUG DEATH Rickey White (L) was charged with second-degree murder in the death of Adan Manzano (R)(Kenner PD and Telemundo Kansas City) The Kenner Police Department announced on Monday that White now faces a second-degree murder charge in connection with Manzano's death. Police didn't explain why the second-degree murder charge was added, but said it comes as detectives \"have worked tirelessly to uncover the details surrounding the events that led to Mr. Manzano’s tragic death.\" Kenner Police Chief Keith Conley previously detailed the events leading up to Manzano's death to Fox News Digital. \"They met inthe French Quarter,probably in the wee hours of the morning. They came back to the hotel that was in the city of Kenner about 4:30 a.m. on Feb. 5, at which time we do have surveillance video from the lobby of the hotel showing them going into [Manzano's] room around that time,\" Conley said. 'BOURBON STREET HUSTLER,' ARRESTED AFTER KANSAS CITY REPORTER DEATH, NEEDS RESENTENCING FOR FRAUD HISTORY: AG Danette Colbert, 45, whom Kenner police described as a \"career criminal,\" is facing four counts of being a fugitive, two counts of a traffic violation, one count of \"purse snatching,\" one count of aggravated device fraud, one count of illegal transfer of funds, one count of bank fraud, one count of computer fraud and one count of robbery.(Kenner PD) \"Then [Colbert] came out, ran to the store, came back about 30 minutes later, and within 10 or 15 minutes, she left the room. And he was never seen again on any video other than when he went into the room. So, she was the last one to be with him,\" the police chief added. One of Manzano's credit cards was missing when detectives were processing his hotel room, leading them to obtain a search warrant for the credit card history, leading law enforcement to Colbert. Colbert is connected to several other alleged drugging and robberies in bothNew Orleansand Las Vegas, and may be connected to another man's death in New Orleans.

We're working with state police and the attorney general's office to get as much information as we can before we come to any conclusions because, in cases like this, you have to investigate, you can't just speculate.\" Fox News Digital's Audrey Conklin contributed to this report.

    "article_text": "Elizabeth Smart, who survived a nine-month kidnapping when she was 14, offers advice on staying safe and how family and friends can identify and address \"red flags.\" A series of Facebook ads funded by the California Democratic Party is claiming that Republicans are against stronger laws to protect 16- and 17-year-old sex trafficking victims amid a legislative fight over aminor solicitationbill in which Democrats successfully forced the exclusion of harsher penalties for the purchase or solicitation of older teens. The ads began appearing on social media after a vote in the California Assembly last week when Democrat leaders refused to move forward with AB 379, which would have made it an automatic felony to purchase or solicit 16- and 17-year-olds for sex. Featured in each ad is the name and image of a state Republican lawmaker who \"voted against stronger laws protecting\" older teens from sex trafficking, accusing them of protecting their \"political party, not our kids.\" SON OF SUSPECTED WOULD-BE TRUMP ASSASSIN ARRESTED ON CHILD PORN CHARGES California Assemblymember Maggy Krell, a Democrat, on Monday said she agreed to remove a provision in her child sex trafficking bill that ensures the crime of purchasing a minor for sex applies in all cases where the victim is under the age of 18.(Assemblymember Maggy Krell) AB 379, authored by Democratic Assemblymember Maggy Krell, was an attempt to crack down on the buyers in the child sex trafficking trade and to align their punishments with the traffickers. The ad campaign came after the Democrat-controlled Assembly Public Safety Committee decided to move the bill forward as long as it didn't carry the felony provision for those who solicit older teens for sex. At the time, Krell told Fox News Digital that she wasforced to excludethe felony provision in order for the legislation to move forward. \"I wholeheartedly disagree with that amendment,\" she said. \"This has been my life’s work and I will continue to partner with sex trafficking survivors and law enforcement to ensure all minors are protected from the horrors of sex trafficking.\" On Thursday, Democrats voted to strip the bill completely from Krell, a former prosecutor who investigated human trafficking, while excluding the automatic felony clause. They also inserted text that read, \"It is the intent of the Legislature to adopt the strongest laws to protect 16-and 17-year old victims and strengthen protections in support of survivors of human trafficking.\" \"Just when you thought the @CA_Dem couldn't go any lower, any more pathetic and desperate, here they are, trying to falsely spin themselves out of siding with predators over children, (poorly) playing politics over people. SO excited for 2026,\" the California Republican Party shared Monday on X. WANDA BARZEE, ONE OF ELIZABETH SMART'S CAPTORS, ARRESTED ON ALLEGED SEX OFFENDER VIOLATION The California State Capitol(Arturo Holmes/Getty Images for National Urban League) Several Republican lawmakers also pushed back against the accusation that their party doesn't protect children. \"You see my friend Democrats lie… After we called @AsmDems out on the floor last week for removing protections for 16 and 17-year-old victims, they run ads accusing us… of the very thing they are doing,\" Assembly Republican Leader James Gallagher wrote on X. \"You can’t hide from the truth with deceptive ads. It is Democrats who can’t bring themselves to part with weird ideological politics to protect kids.\" Assemblyman Josh Hoover, one of several Republicans targeted in the ad campaign, said Democrats were attempting to gaslight Californians. \"Make no mistake, these ads are nothing but a distraction from their own failed record on public safety,\" he wrote on social media. \"I will continue to fight to restore the protections they removed, hold perpetrators accountable, and make sure all minors are treated equally under the law.\" The ad campaign was reportedly being pushed by the campaign of Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas. Fox News Digital has reached out to theCalifornia Democratic Partyand Rivas' campaign. FATHER PRESSES FOR ANSWERS IN COLLEGE FRESHMAN DAUGHTER'S DEATH AFTER FALL FROM DORM: ‘SHE WAS OUR WORLD’ California Assembly Republican Leader James Gallagher and other GOP lawmakers were targeted by Democrats in a social media ad campaign.(Fcaebook) AB 379 came together after older teens were left out of a state law that went into effect this year that makes it a felony to purchase a child aged 15 and younger for sex. Last year, California State Sen. Shannon Groven authored a bill that made it illegal to buy minors for sex, but it excluded 16- and 17-year-olds. Currently, traffickers, not the buyers, face the harshest consequences when convicted of trafficking anyone under 18. Last week, DemocratCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsomsaid he supported harsher consequences for those who solicit minors for sex. Assemblyman Joe Patterson said Newsom has lost control of his own party and that the state Democratic Party is treating him \"like a lame duck.\" Assemblywoman Kate Sanchez said Democrats across the state have failed Californians on a range of issues, including public safety, affordability and homelessness. \"All they have left are dirty lies that are easily rebutted by journalists,\" she wrote. The National Republican Congressional Committee also weighed in on the matter. \"California Democrats chose predators over children and out-of-touch Democrats Derek Tran and Dave Min have said nothing,\" Christian Martinez, a spokesperson for the NRCC, told Fox News Digital while calling out Democrat lawmakers. \"Worse, they’re letting their fellow Democrats whitewash their disgusting record of protecting the absolute worst among us.\" Inside the California State Capitol building(iStock) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Last week, Krell said she didn't care if the bill had her name on it or not, but would support any proposal that included protections for 16- and 17-year-olds.

An article from The New Yorker went viral on Monday for showcasing notable New Yorkers in their living rooms, ranging from big names in entertainment to politics. Staff writer Naomi Fry summarized that living rooms are \"the most public-facing of a home’s spaces, and, as such, it bears a particular burden: that of showcasing to others who the occupants are.\" Many of the photos that went viral were specifically those of Democrats.

The Evergreen State’s new law adds \"members of the clergy\" to a list of professionals who are required to report information obtained through confessionals that relate to child abuse or neglect, to law enforcement or other state authorities.

Barstool Sports founderDave Portnoysaid Monday he revoked \"a teachable moment\" offer to one of the men allegedly involved in the antisemitic sign at one of the company’s bars. The sports media personality explained in a video the new twist that took place. A video of the sign, whichread \"f--- the Jews,\"surfaced across social media over the weekend.

Portnoy said a post from one of the men involved, who he identified as Mo Kahn, posted a lengthy statement on his Instagram saying he had nothing to do with the incident. The statement claimed that the alleged culprit \"documented what took place as a citizen journalist\" and added that since the video went viral he’s \"faced serious threats to my safety, which has been overwhelming.\" The statement then added, \"I abhor hate in all its forms. I was raised to respect and be amicable with all people. I hope honest and open dialogue can come out of this incident so we can address the deeper realities of the world we live in.

    "title": "Republicans squabble over Trump spending plan as Fiscal Year 2026 looms: 'Stay until we pass it'",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest on President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers working to reduce government spending despite criticism from Democrats on ‘Special Report.’ PresidentDonald Trumpis proposing staggering spending cuts. In his budget request for fiscal year 2026, the president demands that Congress slash an eye-popping 20% of spending which lawmakers allocate each year. \"You're going to see $150 billion (in cuts) passed in the House and the Senate. That is real money,\" said Budget Director Russ Vought on Fox News. \"I think for the first time, this budget is not dead on arrival.\" To be clear, the budget which Mr. Trump sent to Capitol Hill is aspirational. All presidential budgets are. It’s what a president proposes that lawmakers – and his administration – aim to spend for the upcoming fiscal year. Congress is still charged with voting on the 12 annual spending bills which fund the government. The 20% cut proposed by President Trump deals with that area of spending. REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: WHERE WE STAND WITH TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' The new budget championed by Team Trump features drastic spending cuts.(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) The Trump administration characterized this blueprint as a \"skinny\" budget. That’s because it included nothing about Medicare and Medicaid. Those social programs consume exorbitant chunks of federal spending – far exceeding what Congress appropriates each year.Congressional Republicansaim to make alterations of some kind to these programs in their so-called \"big, beautiful bill.\" Republicans insist those programs won’t endure cuts. But a \"cut\" is in the eye of the beholder. \"We're going to move towards a long-term balanced budget. I like how we're thinking long-term instead of short-term,\" said Rep. Mike Haridopolos, R-Fla., on Fox News. To be clear, the framework for the GOP’s big, beautiful bill does not balance the budget. In fact, it increases the budget deficit. And Mr. Trump’s budget package doesn’t balance either. There’s no way to understand such a path unless you include Medicare and Medicaid. But here’s what Mr. Trump’s budget request does do: It eliminates dollars from every federal department and agency, except the Departments of Transportation and Veterans Affairs. Space programs and NASA are also safe, too. \"This is how you break the Swamp,\" declared the House Freedom Caucus. \"The FY ‘26 budget is a paradigm shift.\" The president’s proposal knifes the Department of Housing and Urban Development by 40%. It axes the Departments of Labor and Interior by 30%. TOP SENATE ARMED SERVICES REPUBLICAN SAYS TRUMP OMB'S BUDGET 'SHREDS TO THE BONE' MILITARY CAPABILITIES However, dollars for the Pentagon are essentially flat. Defense hawks were apoplectic. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., torched Mr. Trump’s outline. \"Trump successfully campaigned on a Peace Through Strength agenda. But his advisers at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) were apparently not listening,\" fumed Wicker. \"For the defense budget, OMB has requested a fifth year straight ofBiden administrationfunding, leaving military spending flat, which is a cut in real terms.\" Wicker accused OMB of trying to \"shred to the bone\" the nation’s military. Some members of Congress, like Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., have rebuked Trump's proposal for its effective non-adjustment of defense funds.(Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images) Former Senate Majority LeaderMitch McConnell, R-Ky., chairs the Senate defense appropriations panel, charged with funding the Pentagon. \"It is peculiar how much time the President’s advisors spend talking about restoring peace through strength, given how apparently unwilling they’ve been to invest accordingly in the national defense or in other critical instruments of national power,\" said McConnell. \"I am very concerned the requested base budget for defense does not reflect a realistic path to building the military capability we need to achieve President Trump’sPeace Through Strength agenda,\" said House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Ala. With friends like these… TRUMP SLAMS REPUBLICAN ‘GRANDSTANDERS’ OPPOSING BUDGET BILL, PREDICTS MASSIVE US TAX INCREASES IF IT FAILS Vought fired back at Congressional defense advocates and their allegations that the budget request undercut the military. \"It’s an inaccurate charge. We provide a trillion dollars in national defense spending. 13% increase. We do it in two components,\" said Vought. \"We use discretionary spending. And then we put in a historic paradigm all of our increases on defense and Homeland Security. We use it in reconciliation so that we only need to use Republican votes. We don't want Democrats to have the filibuster as a veto to then hijack the appropriations process and say no to the Homeland Security spending.\" Let me fillet that statement for you. In other words, Vought asserts that some of the funding increases for the Pentagon will come through \"budget reconciliation,\" the process Republicans are now using to pass the big, beautiful bill. Republicans intend to pass that package with only GOP votes. But if Republicans included that military money in a \"regular\" appropriations bill, Democrats may demand \"parity.\" They would insist that non-defense programs score the same increase in exchange for advancing those bills – and voting to overcome a filibuster. So Vought argues his approach keeps Democrats from holding Pentagon dollars hostage in exchange for money targeted toward other programs. Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought rebuffed claims that the Trump budget would undercut the military.(Jacquelyn Martin/AP) But Democrats are focused on what Republicans may try to do with Medicare and Medicaid. They argue that Republicans are teeing up cuts. \"Hospitals will close. Nursing homes will shut down. Communities will be hurt. And Americans will die,\" said House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y. Republicans insist those programs won’t face cuts. \"The question is, will we be susceptible to the fear-mongering and the false rhetoric that you just heard from the Democrat Minority Leader in the House? And this is the same tired play they run,\" said House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, on Fox News. \"We will be rewarded because we're doing this for the sustainability of these programs for the most vulnerable.\" TRUMP SAYS PUBLIC ENTITLEMENTS LIKE SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICAID WON'T BE TOUCHED IN GOP BUDGET BILL Still, even some remain apprehensive about how the GOP will handle those programs. \"If you want to be in the minority forever, then go ahead and do Medicaid cuts,\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. \"That would be catastrophically stupid.\" House SpeakerMike Johnson, R-La., Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo., and Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Brett Guthrie, R-Ky., met President Trump at the White House late last week to discuss the big, beautiful bill. The White House gave Congressional leaders a wish list of items it wants in the bill – and what can fall by the wayside. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., still aims to pass the bill through the House by Memorial Day.(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) Tax credits for electric vehicles are out. \"I don't have a problem if somebody wants to go buy an electric vehicle. I just don't think hardworking Americans should be subsidizing that,\" said House Administration Committee Chairman Bryan Steil, R-Wisc., on Fox News. Republicans hope to use money generated from the sale of EVs to shore up the Highway Trust Fund. The government used the federal gas tax to pay for construction of roads and bridges. But Congress hasn’t adjusted the gas tax since the mid-1990s. Plus, more EVs and hybrids are now on the road. And conventional vehicles which rely on gas are more fuel efficient. So this shores up some of those depleted coffers. HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS EMBRACES TRUMP BUDGET PROPOSAL 'PARADIGM SHIFT' Johnson is sticking by his goal to pass the bill through the House by Memorial Day. But some Republicans doubt that timeline. \"There's no way,\" said Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., on Fox Business. \"Unfortunately, President Trump chose the one big, beautiful (bill). What he should have done is the multiple-step process.\" In other words, lawmakers could have addressed the border, tax cuts and spending cuts in individual chunks. Loading everything onto one legislative truck makes this hard. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP So can the House approve this in two weeks? There’s not a lot of consensus yet. But maybe they’ll try to wear Members down. \"We will stay until we pass it,\" said one senior House GOP leadership source.

    "article_text": "Fox News host Bret Baier dives into the NIL landscape in the NCAA and the debate over the league's payment rules across the country on 'Special Report.' A law firm involved in the historic $2.8 billion antitrust lawsuit settlement involving the NCAA and the nation’s five largest conferences ripped former college football coachNick Sabanand the possibility of an executive order from the Trump administration to deal with name, image and likeness. Attorneys at the Hagens Berman law firm released a statement on Monday calling Saban’s reported involvement in the potential executive order \"unmerited and unhelpful.\" Steve Berman, the firm’s managing partner and co-founder, called Saban and Trump’s talks \"unneeded.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Nick Saban speaks before President Donald Trump arrives to give a commencement address at the University of Alabama, May 1, 2025, in Tuscaloosa.(AP Photo/Mike Stewart) \"While he was a coach, Saban initially opposed NIL payments to athletes, pushing to add restrictions and red-tape through national legislation to add ‘some sort of control,’\" Bermansaid in a statement. \"During his time scrutinizing the athlete pay structure, he made tens of millions of dollars and was previously the highest-paid coach in college football. \"Coach Saban and Trump’s eleventh-hour talks of executive orders and other meddling are just more unneeded self-involvement. College athletes are spearheading historic changes and benefitting massively from NIL deals. They don’t need this unmerited interference from a coach only seeking to protect the system that made him tens of millions.\" The firm added there were a number of ways college athletes have benefitted from NIL without any executive orders from the White House in any administration. The firm said it empowered athletes to earn their own income, among other positives. Fox News Digital reached out to Saban’s rep for comment. Trump was considering an executive order to regulate name, image and likeness in college sports after meeting with the legendary Alabama Crimson Tide coach,the Wall StreetJournalreported last week. Saban reportedly doesn’t want to halt NIL payments but seeks to \"reform\" them.

I think in any competitive venue, you want to have some guidelines that gives everyone an equal opportunity to have a chance to be successful,\" he said. Saban said theNCAA \"can handle\" NILand whatever changes are necessary, but Congress \"needs to\" add \"national legislation.\" \"Now, we just have the state legislation – and every state is different – that would protect the NCAA from litigation once we establish guidelines for the future of college athletics. But the litigation is what got us to this point right now,\" Saban said. \"We have to have some protection from litigation. I don't know if it's antitrust laws or whatever. \"I'm not versed enough on all that to really make a recommendation. But I know we need some kind of federal standard and guidelines that allows people to enforce their own rules.\" Sen.

    "article_text": "Rep. Zach Nunn, R-Iowa, discusses Republicans working on advancing President Donald Trump's ‘big, beautiful bill’ and Israel's response to a Houthi missile striking Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv. The U.S. has reportedly launched a new round of airstrikes in Yemen after the Iran-backed Houthis claimed responsibility for a missile that landed nearIsrael's main airporton Sunday. The Houthi-controlled state news agency in Yemen reported that \"American aggression\" was behind several strikes on the capital, Sanaa, on Monday. At least 16 people were wounded,according to New Arab. Since March 15, U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM) \"has conducted an intense and sustained campaign targeting the Houthi terrorist organization in Yemen to restore freedom of navigation and American deterrence,\" a U.S. Defense official told Fox News Digital on Monday. \"We will continue to increase the pressure and further disintegrate Houthi capabilities as long as they continue to impede freedom of navigation.\" Earlier Monday, Yemen’s Houthis vowed to continue attacks on Israeli airports after the missile briefly halted flights and commuter traffic at Israel’s main international airport near Tel Aviv. The Houthis issued a warning to airlines that they would carry out \"repeated targeting\" of Ben Gurion Airport, Israel’s main gateway to the world. The Houthis had already threatened late Sunday to implement \"a comprehensive aerial blockade\" on Israel as Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahu's Cabinetwas set to vote to expand fighting in Gaza.

USCENTCOM said inits most recent statementon April 27 that its forces have \"conducted an intense and sustained campaign targeting the Houthi terrorist organization in Yemen to restore freedom of navigation and American deterrence\" since March 15. \"These operations have been executed using detailed and comprehensive intelligence ensuring lethal effects against the Houthis while minimizing risk to civilians,\" USCENTCOM said. USCENTCOM said the strikes \"have destroyed multiple command-and-control facilities, air defense systems, advanced weapons manufacturing facilities, and advanced weapons storage locations.\" \"While the Houthis have continued to attack our vessels, our operations have degraded the pace and effectiveness of their attacks. Ballistic missile launches have dropped by 69%. Additionally, attacks from one way attack drones have decreased by 55%,\" USCENTCOM added. \"U.S. strikes destroyed the ability of Ras Isa Port to accept fuel which will begin to impact Houthi ability to not only conduct operations, but also to generate millions of dollars in revenue for their terror activities.\" Travelers walk toward Ben Gurion Airport after main road entrances to the facility were closed by Israeli police in response to a missile launched from Yemen on May 4, 2025.(JACK GUEZ/AFP via Getty Images) HOUTHI MISSILE STRIKES NEAR ISRAELI AIRPORT AFTER EVADING MISSILE DEFENSES \"Iran undoubtedly continues to provide support to the Houthis.

Their missiles have mostly been intercepted, although some have penetrated Israel's missile defense systems, causing damage.

Theconclave will select the new Popein Rome for the world’s more than 1 billion Catholics on Wednesday. The Jesuit Pope Francis made Pizzaballa a cardinal in September 2023. The following month, Hamas terrorists invaded Israel, slaughtered more than 1,200 people and took more than 250 people hostage.

It was a simple and genuine world, and a sober and happy life. Only with time did I realize how that world would influence me by giving me a style and pursuit of sobriety and sincerity.\" Israeli President Isaac Herzog has known Pizzaballa since the turn of the new century in 2000 and praised Pizzaballa’s \"fluid, eloquent Hebrew.\" Herzog previously said, \"He is a brilliant person.

    "article_text": "Fox News senior strategic analyst Gen. Jack Keane weighs in on Israel announcing plans to take all of Gaza in wake of a Houthi missile attack near Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv. A senior Israeli defense official on Monday said PresidentDonald Trump's upcoming visit to the Middle East is the \"window of opportunity\" to secure a hostage deal, otherwise Israel will initiate a new military operation in the Gaza Strip. \"If there is no hostage deal, Operation 'Gideon Chariots' will begin with great intensity and will not stop until all its goals are achieved,\" the official said according to aReuters reportin reference to a Sunday night decision by Israel’s security cabinet to expand operations in the Gaza Strip. Israelwill use the roughly 10-day time frame to prepare for its new operations, which will entail calling up tens of thousands of reserve troops with the goal of taking over all the Gaza Strip. ISRAEL APPROVES PLAN TO CAPTURE ALL OF GAZA, CALLS UP TENS OF THOUSANDS OF RESERVE TROOPS Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, left, with Defense Minister Israel Katz.(Israeli PM's Office) In an apparent move to counter the terror group Hamas, the Israel Defense Forces will remain in captured territory rather than withdraw forces after an operation is complete. Israel has not presented a plan for how long it intends to occupy the Palestinian lands in a move that violated U.N.-brokered treaties and internationally recognized borders. A spokesman for Israeli Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahudid not respond to Fox News Digital’s questions. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement that the plan approved by the cabinet to occupy territory and sustain Israel's presence in Gaza should be named the \"Smotrich-Netanyahu plan\" to \"give up on the hostages and Israel's security and national resilience.\" In the statement, the forum said that this plan is an admission by the government that it is choosing territories over freeing the hostages and noted that more than 70% of Israelis have opposed military prioritization over hostages in recent polling. Trump had planned to make his trip to theMiddle East, where he will visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates between May 13 and 16, his first international visit since re-entering the White House, to signify the significance of the region to the U.S. While this will still be a major geopolitical visit, his first international trip ended up being his visit to Italy for Pope Francis’ funeral, where he held close discussions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Neither the White House nor the State Department immediately responded to Fox News Digital’s questions regarding Israel’s increasingly aggressive position and how it isimpacting hostage and peace deal negotiations.

We want to bring back all of our hostages,\" Netanyahu said. \"That is a very important goal. In war, there is a supreme objective. And that supreme objective is victory over our enemies. And that is what we will achieve.\" The Israeli prime minister also on Saturday justified his increasingly aggressive operations in Gaza that have resulted in the death of more than 50,000 in the Gaza Strip, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, includingmore than 15,600 childrenas of late-March, as \"a war between civilization and barbarism.\" The building belonging to the Berbag family was destroyed after an Israeli attack, leaving several Palestinians, including children, dead and wounded in Khan Yunis, Gaza, on Aug. 2, 2024.(Photo by Abed Rahim Khatib/Anadolu via Getty Images) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Qatar, which has been heavily involved in hostage negotiations andceasefire efforts, responded in a Saturday post on social media and said the comments \"fall short of the most basic standards of political and moral responsibility.\" \"Portraying the ongoing aggression against Gaza as a defense of ‘civilization’ echoes the rhetoric of regimes throughout history that have used false narratives to justify crimes against innocent civilians,\" said Majed Al Ansari, advisor to Qatar Prime Minister Mohammad Al-Thani and spokesman for the foreign ministry.

But without congressional action, the name could be reverted by a future administration – which spurred Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., to introduce a bill enshrining the name in federal law.

    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. A pro-Trump legal group founded by White House aide Stephen Miller is suingSupreme CourtChief Justice John Roberts — a long-shot move as Trump allies fight court rulings blocking key actions from the Oval Office. The lawsuit was filed by the America First Legal Foundation against Roberts in his capacity as the official head of the U.S. Judicial Conference and Robert J. Conrad, who serves as the director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. The complaint accuses both theU.S. Judicial Conferenceand the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts of performing certain regulatory actions that go beyond the scope of resolving cases or controversies, or administratively supporting those actions, which they argue are the \"core functions\" of the judiciary. It also argues that records held by the Roberts-led U.S. Judicial Conference should therefore be subject to the Freedom of Information Act requests, or FOIA requests, as a result. TRUMP'S EXECUTIVE ORDER ON VOTING BLOCKED BY FEDERAL JUDGES AMID FLURRY OF LEGAL SETBACKS Supreme Court Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Brett M.

(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) The U.S. Judicial Conference is the national policymaking body for the courts. It is overseen by the Supreme Court's chief justice, and tasked with making twice-yearly recommendations to Congress as needed. The Administrative Office for the U.S. Courts, meanwhile, operates under the guidance and supervision of the Judicial Conference. Its role is to provide administrative support to the federal courts on certain administrative issues and for day-to-day logistics, including setting budgets and organizing data, among other things. Plaintiffs for AFL, led by attorney Will Scolinos, argued in their lawsuit that the Judicial Conference’s duties are \"executive functions,\" and functions they allege must be supervised by executive officers \"who are appointed and accountable to other executive officers.\" Further, AFL argued, \"Courts definitively do not create agencies to exercise functions beyond resolving cases or controversies or administratively supporting those functions.\" In their view, this is also sufficient to put the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts — as it is overseen by the Judicial Conference — under the executive branch as well.

Every time you say my name, you’re reminding the world that you’re terrified of smart, bold Black women telling the truth and holding you accountable. So keep talking,\"Crockett said. Trump on Sunday told Kristen Welker, host of NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" that Crockett is a \"low I.Q. person,\" calling her the future of the Democratic Party, which he described as in \"disarray.\" Rep. Jasmine Crockett Reports last week indicated that Crockett, who is currently the vice ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, has her eyes set on the chair position of the committee.

Crockett was also criticized this year for calling Gov. Greg Abbott, R-Texas, who is in a wheelchair, \"Governor Hot Wheels.\" She tried to walk back the comments after herremarks went viral, calling the outrage a \"distraction\" and claiming she was \"appalled that the very people who unequivocally support Trump – a man known for racially insensitive nicknames and mocking those with disabilities – are now outraged.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Crockett did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

    "article_text": "Kentucky Senate candidate Daniel Cameron joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss his reaction to the looming lawsuit after the Trump admin accused the New York AG of mortgage fraud and challenges associated with the REAL ID requirement. New York Attorney GeneralLetitia Jameson Monday said she is leading a coalition of 20 states in suing the Trump administration over its cuts to public health funding and the Department of Health and Human Services, describing the efforts in a press conference as the most \"sweeping and unlawful assault on public health\" in U.S. history. The lawsuit, filed by James and other state attorneys general, accuses the Trump administration of violating \"hundreds\" of laws and regulations in attempting to dismantle the Department of Health and Human Services, both by firing thousands of HHS employees in an effort to slash its overall workforce by 20,000 people and shuttering crucial health programs across the U.S. \"This administration is not streamlining the federal government; they are sabotaging it,\" Jamessaid Monday. She used a press conference to highlight the risks these cuts pose for Americans in New York and across the country. 100 DAYS OF INJUNCTIONS, TRIALS AND 'TEFLON DON': TRUMP SECOND TERM MEETS ITS BIGGEST TESTS IN COURT N.Y. Attorney General Letitia James(Michael M. Santiago) \"When you fire the scientists who research infectious diseases, silence the doctors who care for pregnant people and shut down the programs that help firefighters and miners breathe or children thrive, you are not making America healthy; you are putting countless lives at risk,\" James said. \"This is not how government is supposed to work. These actions are dangerous, cruel and illegal. They defy Congress's authority and they violate federal law. And that is why today I am leading a lawsuit joined by Democratic attorneys general across the country to stop this administration from tearing down our public health infrastructure.\" The plaintiffs, who filed the lawsuit Monday in the U.S. District Court inRhode Island, are asking the court \"to halt the unlawful dismantling of HHS, to stop the mass firings, and to restore the life-saving programs that millions of Americans depend on,\" James said. New York is joined in the lawsuit by the attorneys generals of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia. Their lawsuit accuses the Trump administration in the lawsuit of erasing \"decades ofpublic healthprogress\" and leaving HHS \"unable to execute many of its most vital functions.\" FEDERAL JUDGES IN NEW YORK AND TEXAS BLOCK TRUMP DEPORTATIONS AFTER SCOTUS RULING Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) Such actions, they argue, are \"in violation of Congress’s instructions,the U.S. Constitution, and the many statutes that govern the Department’s programs and appropriate funds for it to administer.\" These actions included terminating 10,000 full-time employees, collapsing 28 agencies into 15, and closing half of HHS’s 10 regional offices. James cited many of these issues directly in the press conference Monday, taking aim at the administration for systematically depriving HHS of the \"resources necessary to do its job.\" The government has \"all but stopped testing for measles in the middle of an unprecedented measles outbreak,\" James said. New York's Wadsworth Center, she noted, is one of the \"only labs in the country still equipped to detect rare infectious diseases\" and is \"scrambling to fill the void left by ahollowed-out CDC.\" Her remarks come after HHS announced thousands of layoffs in March and April, including at the FDA, the CDC and NIH. The reductions were in keeping with a Department of Government Efficiency-led push for agencies to slash the size of the federal workforce and trim government spending, prompting criticism from Democrats and some Republicans. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ASKS SUPREME COURT TO REVIEW EL SALVADOR DEPORTATION FLIGHT CASE President Donald Trump(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) These cuts included terminating HHS employees tasked with determining SNAP and Medicaid eligibility for low-income or disabled Americans; the firing of the CDC's entire maternal health team; and the gutting of mental health and substance abuse services and personnel. \"None of these layoffs were necessary to accommodate a funding shortfall – Congress’s appropriations have remained steady, or in many cases, grown in recent years,\" the plaintiffs said in their lawsuit. \"All told, 20,000 full-time employees – almost twenty-five percent of HHS headcount – would be terminated in a few months to save, by Defendants’ own estimate, less than one percent of HHS expenditures.\" Plaintiffs in the lawsuit asked tohalt HHS effortsto dismantle the HHS-led agencies and programs that were cut as a result of the reorganization. States are also seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent what they described as the \"unconstitutional and illegal dismantling of the Department.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The lawsuit is not the first time James, a longtime foe of the current president, has sparred with Trump since the start of his second presidential term.

The White House said Monday \"no final decisions\" have been made regarding the Trump administration's planned tariffs onforeign moviemaking,as one expert welcomed the potential action as a reprieve for the American film industry. \"Although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the Administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump’s directive to safeguard our country’s national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again,\"White House spokespersonKush Desai said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

    "article_text": "National Review staff writer Caroline Downey and Oakland corps advisor Lucy Caldwell join 'MediaBuzz' to discuss the media sympathizing with bureau officials after President Donald Trump fires FBI agents who investigated the January 6 attack. FIRST ON FOX:Twenty-three state attorneys general sent a letter to Senate leaders on Monday urging lawmakers to swiftly confirmPresident Donald Trump's nominee to serve as United States Attorney for the District of Columbia, Ed Martin, ahead of a May 20 deadline, when judges on a court led by Trump-antagonist Judge James Boasberg could select a temporary replacement. \"To put it bluntly, the District of Columbia is broken. And four years of alleged corruption, mismanagement, and derelictions of duty in the U.S. Attorney’s Office under President Biden’s appointees are in many ways to blame. The District should be made safe again. The District should have a U.S. Attorney who replaces the rule of lawfare with the rule of law. Ed Martin is the man to achieve those goals. We strongly encourage the Senate to confirm him at the earliest possible date,\" reads the letter, which was first exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital. It was sent to Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley on Monday afternoon. The letter comes as a May 20 deadline looms to confirm the Trump nominee, when his role as interim U.S. attorney runs dry after 120 days in the role. Martin, who previously worked as a defense attorney and represented Americanscharged in the Jan. 6 riotat the Capitol in 2021, was named interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia beginning on Inauguration Day. If an interim U.S. attorney is not confirmed by the Senate within 120 days, judges on the federal district court for that district can name a new interim U.S. attorney until a nominee is confirmed, Department of Justice documents show. Trump antagonist Judge James Boasberg, an Obama-appointed judge at the center of legal efforts targeting Trump's deportation efforts, is the current chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. TRUMP NOMINATES JAN. 6 DEFENSE ATTORNEY FOR TOP PROSECUTOR ROLE IN DC President Donald Trump, left, and Ed Martin.(Getty/AP) Trump has previously slammed the entireD.C. District Court,saying it would be \"virtually impossible\" for him to get an \"honest ruling\" after Boasberg blocked Trump's Venezuelan deportation flights in March. \"Our Nation’s Courts are broken, with New York and DC being the most preeminent of all in their Corruption and Radicalism. There must be an immediate investigation of this Rigged System, before it is too late!\" Trump posted to Truth Social in March. Indiana Republican Attorney General Todd Rokita spearheaded the letter and told Fox Digital on Monday that Martin has already shown in his few months serving on an interim basis that \"he’s a proven leader.\" \"I am proud to lead this effort to support Ed Martin because he’s a proven leader who is already devoting all of his time to restoring the rule of law in our nation’s capital,\" Rokita said. \"His bold actions have had an immediate impact, which sent the disreputable D.C. news media into a full-blown meltdown - the Senate must act swiftly to confirm him and ensure his critical work continues uninterrupted.\" TRUMP NOMINATES JUDGE TO SERVE AS NEXT US ATTORNEY FOR SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA The letter similarly argued that the Senate confirmation process should go smoothly as lawmakers can already examine Martin's track record in the role. President Donald Trump speaks with reporters at the White House.(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) \"The Senate does not have to wonder or speculate about whether Mr. Martin will lead the U.S. Attorney’s Office with honor and skill,\" the state attorneys general continued in their letter. \"As interim U.S. Attorney for the District since January 20, 2025, he has shown conclusively that he has what it takes to serve in that role with integrity and a fearless commitment to do what is right on behalf of the American people. And there are few offices in the American justice system that could use that kind of leader now as much as the D.C. U.S. Attorney’s Office.\" The 23 states that joined the letter include: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and West Virginia. Martin's confirmation has stalled, however, with Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, voicing concerns about the nomination during the committee’s May 1 executive business meeting. FEDERAL PROSECUTOR VOWS TO PROTECT DOGE STAFFERS FROM ANY 'THREATS, CONFRONTATIONS' TARGETING MUSK TEAM \"Last Friday, we received responses from Mr. Martin to our questions, and it raised even more questions. Mr. Martin made a number of false statements and contradictory statements that are easily disproven by the material he himself disclosed in his Senate Judiciary Questionnaire. And it wasn’t just to my questions—it was to Chairman Grassley’s questions as well,\" Durbin said during the meeting. From left to right, Judge James Boasberg, Ed Martin and President Donald Trump. The AGs took specific issue with how crime has spiraled in the nation's capital under the Biden administration, which they cited was related to the justice system and failing to prosecute criminals. \"Under President Biden, public safety and the quality of life deteriorated in the District of Columbia. Matthew Graves—President Biden’s appointee as chief federal prosecutor for District—oversaw during his tenure a deeply troubling increase in crime in the nation’s capital.  In 2023 alone, the number ofhomicides in D.C.increased by 35% over the previous year. Robberies were up 67%. Car theft skyrocketed by 82%. All the while, Mr. Graves declined to prosecute over two-thirds of all criminal cases brought to his office. In this way, President Biden brought to the District the same lax-on-crime policies that have benighted many of America’s largest cities for decades,\" they wrote. Interim United States Attorney for the District of Columbia Edward Martin.(Getty Images) Since taking over the position, Martin has overseen the dismissals of various Jan. 6 cases after Trump pardoned and commuted the defendants. Martin also published a fiery letter in February vowing to hold to account those who try to sabotage the efforts of theDepartment of Government Efficiency(DOGE) to clean the federal government of overspending and corruption. Trump granted clemency to more than 1,500 Jan. 6 criminal defendants upon taking office earlier this year. TRUMP UNLOADS ON JUDGE BOASBERG, 'RADICAL LEFT JUDGES' FOR HALTING DEPORTATIONS OF VIOLENT ILLEGAL ALIENS \"I recognize that some of the staff at DOGE have been targeted publicly,\" Martin wrote to Elon Musk in the February letter. \"At this time, I ask that you utilize me and my staff to assist in protecting the DOGE work and the DOGE workers. Any threats, confrontations or other actions in any way that impact their work may break numerous laws.\" Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita spearheaded a letter to Senate leaders calling for the speedy confirmation of Ed Martin as U.S. attorney.(Getty Images) \"Let me assure you of this: We will pursue any and all legal action against anyone who impedes your work or threatens your people,\" he continued. \"We will not act like the previous administration who looked the other way as the Antifa and BLM rioters as well as thugs with guns trashed our capital city. We will protect DOGE and other workers no matter what.\" In their letter, the state attorneys general said Martin has done more to crack down on crime during his few months as interim leader than his predecessor did under the Biden administration. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Mr. Martin has prosecuted and seized the assets of pro-Hamas protestors who defaced monuments and assaulted police. He has pursued and indicted Chinese-backed hackers who threatened our national security. He has prosecuted and disrupted the operations of gangs of illegal aliens.

He has done more in less than four months to restore law and order to the District than Matthew Graves did in nearly four years,\" they wrote.",

It's instead just being wasted.\" At the same time, the Trump administration’s National Institutes of Health has been under fire for similar cuts in its own DOGE efforts, withone CNN reportciting a critic claiming \"people will die.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The network looked into changes made in a Health and Human Services database, and one source said they had been getting texts from concerned people. Back in Jackson, White said the HIV/AIDS funding audit is only the latest in his office’s wide-ranging efforts to curb waste or fraud in terms of state taxpayer monies. \"DOGE has highlighted in particular how grants passed down from the federal government to state governments, and then to non-profits, are really a massive, massive fraud risk,\" he said. \"Our audit here proves that the craziest kind of stuff that you see at the federal level and the craziest stuff that may see in California or New York is happening in red states too.

    "article_text": "Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., paraphrases Martin Niemoeller's poem during a House Judiciary Committee markup. House Judiciary Committee member Hank Johnson, D-Ga., made waves when he made allusions to the Holocaust while obliquely criticizing the deportationof Kilmar Abrego Garciaand the arrest of Milwaukee Judge Hannah Dugan. Johnson was speaking during a Wednesday committee markup meeting when he began paraphrasing German preacher Martin Niemöller’s confession as someone who once supported the Nazi Party until it was too late to object to its mounting atrocities. \"You know, first, they came for the Latinos outside of the Home Depots, trying to get work so that they could feed their families,\" Johnson began. \"And I didn't say anything about it because I'm not a Latino at the Home Depot.\" SENATOR WARNS OF UNCONSTITUTIONAL JUDICIAL OVERREACH AHEAD OF SCOTUS SHOWDOWN Rep. Henry \"Hank\" Johnson questions a witness during a hearing.(Getty Images) \"Then they came for the Hispanic-looking folks [with] hats backward with tattoos. And theydeported them to El Salvador. And I didn't say anything about that because I don't wear my [hat] backward, and I don't have any tattoos, and I don't look like a Latino.\" \"Then they came for the Latinas at home, taking care of the children. They scooped up the Latinas and the children, some of whom were American citizens, one of whom was receiving treatment for cancer. They swept them up, took them off, and deported them. And I didn't say anything about it. Because I'm not a Latina. I'm not a little child who's an American citizen.\" Johnson went on to make the same allusion to students protesting in support of Hamas on campus, who have been another target of the Trump administration. \"They sent jackbooted thugs wearing masks to pick them up, take them thousands of miles away and put them in a private for-profit detention center where they languish at taxpayer expense. And I didn't say anything about it because I'm not a student on a foreign visa,\" Johnson said. He then noted how Dugan had been arrested for allegedly aiding an illegal immigrant in avoiding federal immigration authorities, saying he did not speak up because he was not a \"White female judge.\" \"But then they came for me. And I looked around, and there was nobody left because I had remained silent,\" he said. DEM SEN JOINS GROUP OF FAR LEFT LAWMAKERS WHO THINK TRUMP HAS AGAIN COMMITTED IMPEACHABLE OFFENSES Johnson concluded by noting he paraphrased a poem from Germany, saying it \"resonated back then as it does today.\" \"It’s important that the people understand what is happening with our constitutional rights in this country. Everyone is entitled to due process, whether or not you are documented or undocumented, whether or you are a citizen or not. You're entitled to due process.\" He said an amendment up for a vote in the markup sought to affirm that. An amendment in the meeting record would have prohibited certain funds from being used to remove \"an alien in violation of their rights under the Fifth Amendment.\" It was voted down. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News Digital reached out to Johnson for comment, as well as House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, for response. On X, the official House Judiciary Committee Republican account mocked Johnson’s remarks, writing, \"Wow, Hank Johnson just implied that all Latinos hang out at Home Depot.\" Johnson’s penchant for colorful remarks goes back more than a decade to 2010, when he warned then-Pacific Fleet commander Adm. Robert Willard during a House Armed Service Committee hearing on military-buildupplans that Guam could potentially\"tip over and capsize\" due to overpopulation.

    "article_text": "White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller vowed that President Donald Trumps administration will bring an end to DEI \"strangulation.\" FIRST ON FOX:A pro-Trump legal nonprofit is asking for the U.S. Department of Education to investigate an Ohio school district that the group says is pushing an \"unlawful\" DEI agenda and violating federal anti-discrimination law. The complaint from America First Legal alleges that the Upper Arlington School District in Columbus, Ohio has implemented DEI policies dating back to 2020 and cites material from thedistrict’s own website. \"In June 2020, during the height of the Black Lives Matter riots, the Upper Arlington School Board, like many other educational institutions and corporations in our country, caved to Black Lives Matter demands and began to implement racist and discriminatory DEI policies in the District,\" the complaint alleges. \"The District added a Chief Talent Officer (\"CTO\") to \"foster workforce diversity. Upper Arlington also added an Equity Advisory Board, which aims to ‘provide invaluable insight and feedback on the recruitment of a diverse staff.’ The School District also created a new position, the Chief Excellence and Engagement Officer, who was tasked with ‘spearhead[ing] Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) efforts.’\" WATCH: UNEARTHED FOOTAGE EXPOSES MEDICAL SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS PLEDGING TO RESIST TRUMP EXECUTIVE ORDERS The Upper Arlington School District is facing a legal complaint over its DEI policies(Getty) The complaint alleges that DEI advocacy continued in the years after 2020 and quoted a district report that said \"[t]here is a need for a clear vision for DEI initiatives [and] advocacy for LGBTQIA+ students\" while referring \"those who oppos[e] DEI efforts\" as \"negative voices.\" A \"Comprehensive Equity Report\" from the district \"contains \"discriminatory and illegal recommendations\", according to the complaint. The complaint makes the case that the DEI practices within the district are not in line with current Education Department rules and guidelines and suggests that federal funding to the school could be in jeopardy. WHITE HOUSE VOWS TO IMPLEMENT 'SYSTEM OF MERIT' IN US, DISMANTLE DEI 'STRANGULATION' \"When our nation’s schools discriminate based on race and sex, and embed divisive racial and sexual ideologies into their curriculum, it not only violates the law, but it also warps our children’s education,\" Jacob Meckler, America First Legal Counsel, told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"The Department of Education should investigate the Upper Arlington School District and, if appropriate, terminate federal taxpayer funding.\" Fox News Digital reached out to the school district and Department of Education for comment. Upper Arlington School District has been in hot water over DEI practices in the past when  video surfaced in 2023 showing district officials discussing how they can push critical race theory covertly, Fox News Digitalpreviously reported. \"There's more than one way to skin a cat,\" Matthew Boaz, the executive director of diversity, equity and inclusion of Upper Arlington Schools, said. \"You can pass a bill that you can't teach CRT in a classroom, but if you didn't cover programming, or you didn't cover extracurricular activities or something like that, that message might still get out. Oops.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Upper Arlington School District in Ohio is facing criticism over its DEI policies(Getty Images/iStock) In a statement to Fox News Digital Superintendent Hunt said, \"On April 30, Upper Arlington Schools received a copy of a letter sent to the United States Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights by an attorney writing on behalf of the advocacy group America First Legal.  The letter accuses the district of ‘illegal DEI policies,’ but fails to identify any specific practices or policies that are actually in place in the district.\" \"We take any concerns of discrimination seriously and we will continue, as always, in our commitment to our mission of challenging and supporting every student, every step of the way, to our vision that every student is prepared to serve, lead, and succeed, and to our values - start with heart, strength in team, and contagious drive.  Our new Excellence & Innovation 2030 Strategic Plan is rooted in these commitments, and we will remain focused on providing our students with the high quality educational experience that our community expects.\" Hunt added that \"we will certainly cooperate fully\" if an investigation is opened. A Dept. of Education spokesperson told Fox News Digital that the department \"doesn't confirm complaints.\" Earlier this year, the Department of Educationissued a letterwarning public schools across the country that they must remove diversity, equity and inclusion policies or risk losing federal funding. \"Institutions that fail to comply with federal civil rights law may, consistent with applicable law, face potential loss of federal funding,\" Craig Trainor, acting assistant secretary for civil rights in the Department of Education, said in the letter.

    "title": "GOP leaders find new major holiday deadline for Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' amid Medicaid, tax divisions",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest on President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers working to reduce government spending despite criticism from Democrats on ‘Special Report.’ Some Republican leaders are hoping they can pass a massive bill codifying PresidentDonald Trump's agenda into federal law by the Fourth of July. It means the sweeping policy overhaul could reach Trump’s desk for a signature by the 250th anniversary of the United States’ founding. \"I’ve said all along, my goal is, is for the president to sign this one big, beautiful bill on July 4th,\" House Ways & Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo., told \"Fox News Sunday.\" It comes as House Republicans struggle to reconcile differences on clean energy and Medicaid in talks to find at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts to pay for Trump’s tax policies. SCOOP: REPUBLICANS DISCUSS DEFUNDING 'BIG ABORTION' LIKE PLANNED PARENTHOOD IN TRUMP AGENDA BILL Republican leaders are signaling they want a bill on President Donald Trump's desk by Fourth of July.(Getty Images) Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters days earlier on Capitol Hill, \"We’ve got three legs to the President’s economic agenda: trade, tax and deregulation, and we hope that we can have this tax portion done by Fourth of July.\" Republican lawmakers are working on a multitrillion-dollar piece of legislation aimed at advancing Trump’s policies on tax, defense, energy, immigration, border security and at raising the debt limit. Trump’s tax policies, a cornerstone of his platform and the costliest portion of the bill, include extending the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and eliminating taxes on tips, overtime pay and retirees’ social security. Republican leaders and tax hawks have warned that failing to extend TCJA by the time its provisions expire at the end of this year could result in a tax hike of over 20% for millions of families. House GOP leaders said in a letter to lawmakersdated April 5, \"Immediately following House adoption of the budget resolution, our House and Senate committees will begin preparing together their respective titles of the reconciliation bill to be marked up in the next work period. As always, this will involve input from all Members and will keep us on track to send a bill to the President’s desk by Memorial Day.\" BROWN UNIVERSITY IN GOP CROSSHAIRS AFTER STUDENT'S DOGE-LIKE EMAIL KICKS OFF FRENZY However, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has since somewhat walked that goal back, telling reporters he believes the House can finish its portion by Memorial Day. \"We are on track to pass the bill out of the House. As we've said from the very beginning, and get it over, to the next stage by Memorial Day,\" Johnson said during a press conference last week. He was optimistic about beating the early July goal after meeting with Bessent and other top lawmakers last Monday, however. \"He says July 4 because that’s a big, big birthday for us. And everybody knows that,\" Johnson said of Bessent’s comments. \"But I think – and I hope, and believe – that we can get it done sooner than that.\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent floated the Independence Day deadline.(Getty Images) A House GOP leadership aide told Fox News Digital that Johnson \"stated his goal is to move the bill through the House by Memorial Day\" and that it was \"not in conflict\" with sending a bill to Trump by July 4. When asked if that goal was feasible, Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., told Fox News Digital, \"It’s gonna have to be.\" Others who spoke with Fox News Digital were more skeptical. A senior House Republican aide told Fox News Digital, \"Deadlines are so arbitrary in Congress. Passing the bill by Memorial Day was always a long shot, but moving the goalposts from Easter to Memorial Day to July 4 just shows weakness.\" \"We better stick with this one, because the next federal holiday isn’t until September!\" the aide said. Republicans are not only racing the clock on the TCJA deadline, but also the possibility of a national credit default. The U.S. is expected to run out of cash to pay its debts sometime this summer, according to several projections – a somewhat murky deadline based on a number of factors, including yearly tax filings. MEET THE TRUMP-PICKED LAWMAKERS GIVING SPEAKER JOHNSON A FULL HOUSE GOP CONFERENCE Hitting that date without acting on the debt limit would send domestic and global financial markets into turmoil. Republicans are looking to move Trump’s agenda via the budget reconciliation process. By lowering the Senate’s threshold for passage from 60 votes to 51, it allows the party in power to sideline the opposition, in this case Democrats, while passing legislation focused on spending, taxes and debt. After both the House and Senate passed budget \"frameworks\" earlier this year, the relevant committees named in the frameworks are working to write policy in line with the spending cut or surplus they are granted. Seven of 11 House committees have completed their work so far. However, three critical panels – the committees on Ways & Means, Agriculture, and Energy & Commerce – had to delay initial tentative plans to advance their portions this week. Republicans in blue states, who GOP leaders view as critical to keeping the majority, have raised alarms about cutting too deeply into Medicaid. It is under the jurisdiction of the Energy & Commerce Committee, which is tasked with finding $880 billion of the $1.5 trillion in spending cuts. Negotiators have insisted they are only interested in going after waste, fraud and abuse in the system, but it has not stopped Democrats from accusing the GOP of trying to cut critical healthcare programs for millions of Americans. Meanwhile, the committee is also going to have to decide on an ongoing battle between conservatives and blue state Republicans over whether to repeal some or all of the former Biden administration’sInflation Reduction Act(IRA) green energy tax subsidies. In March, 21 House Republicans signeda letter urging their colleaguesto preserve the green energy tax credit. \"Countless American companies are utilizing sector-wide energy tax credits – many of which have enjoyed broad support in Congress – to make major investments in domestic energy production and infrastructure for traditional and renewable energy sources alike,\" they wrote. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The anti-IRA Republicans, however, said in a letter last week that the U.S.' growing green energy sector was the product of government handouts rather than genuine sustainable growth. \"Leaving IRA subsidies intact will actively undermine America’s return to energy dominance and national security,\" they said. \"They are the result of government subsidies that distort the U.S. energy sector, displace reliable coal and natural gas and the domestic jobs they produce, and put the stability and independence of our electric grid in jeopardy.\" Negotiations are expected to continue this week. When reached for comment on whether the Senate could meet the Independence Day goal, a spokesperson for Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., pointed Fox News Digital to a recent interview where he signaled openness to the idea. \"We have a similar target. And I think the House is, you know, they would like to, the speaker would like to have it out of the House by Memorial Day. And the Senate has a more complicated procedure that we have to go through when it comes to reconciliation that makes it harder and more complicated and takes a little bit longer time,\" Thune said. \"But there's been a ton of work done already, and we're working closely with our counterparts in the House on all the relevant authorizing committees that have been instructed.\" Elizabeth Elkind is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital leading coverage of the House of Representatives.

TheBaltimore Ravenshave released longtime kicker Justin Tucker, though the organization is calling it a \"football decision.\" The Ravens tookArizona’s Tyler Loopin the sixth round of this year’s draft following a rough season for the usually dependable Tucker. However, Tucker has been embroiled in off-the-field controversy as 16 massage therapists from eight different Baltimore spa and wellness centers have accused him of inappropriate behavior from alleged incidents between 2012-16.

Considering our current roster, we have made the tough decision to release Justin Tucker,\" Ravens executive vice president and general manager Eric DeCosta said in a statement on Monday. \"Justin created many significant and unforgettable moments in Ravens history.

The Basketball Hall of Famer said with the buildup of the roster and the heightened expectations, there also comes added pressure. \"So when you talk about Caitlin in her sophomore year, she's more seasoned, she has had time to rest. She's had time to really regroup and see exactly where she wants to go,\" Leslie said. \"Obviously, (the Fever) have a ton of new players, a new coach. And that also builds a lot of pressure. It is so hard to win. It's not easy to win the first year that you get a new coach, new teammates, and you're trying to build this chemistry. I don't want to put too much pressure.

This game needed double overtime to determinethe Jetsas the 4–3 winners, but it was so close to the Blues walking out of the Canada Life Centre with the road victory. The Jets emptied their net and watched as the seconds ticked off the clock in the offensive zone, just hoping for a shot on net to give them a chance at the 3-3 tie and the game in overtime.

However, the puck came right back his way, and instead of attempting another slap shot, he swung it over to Neal Pionk on the right wing. Pionk quickly sent the puck toward the net, and Perfetti was right there for the tip that made it pastBlues netminderJordan Binnington as the clock hit 1.6 seconds left. It beat the buzzer and the crowd went ballistic, knowing the Jets still had a chance to move on in the playoffs.

Scottie Scheffleralways seems comfortable on the golf course, but at his hometown TPC Craig Ranch for the CJ Cup Byron Nelson this week it was pure bliss. Scheffler crushed the competition over the four-day event with a 31-under finish to win the event after posting another 8-under 63, the same result he put on the scorecard on Friday. But he had a chance at thePGA Tour’s all-time scoring record on the 18th green on Sunday when he looked at a birdie putt to finish 32-under. Only Justin Thomas (2017) and Ludvig Åberg (2023) have had 31-under weeks in the past.

He did make some history, however, as his eight-shot win was the largest ever in the tournament. Scheffler is the first Dallas-area high school grad to win the Byron Nelson since 2007, and he got off to a red-hot start when he posted a 10-under-61 in his opening round on Thursday. He followed it up with his 63 on Friday, and though he only shot 66 on Saturday, an eight-shot lead going into Sunday almost felt like a breeze as he stepped in for the final 18 holes. Erik Van Rooyen (23-under), Sam Stevens (20-under) and another Dallas native, Jordan Spieth (19-under), finished behind Scheffler. Scottie Scheffler reacts on the 18th green as he approaches his family after winning the CJ Cup Byron Nelson golf tournament.(Raymond Carlin III-Imagn Images) \"This tournament means a lot to me,\" Scheffler told the CBS broadcast after the victory. \"It’s my first start as a pro, 11 years ago, I had my sister caddying for. … It feels like a lifetime of hard work and sacrifice for little moments like these. They’re pretty special.\" Scheffler was 17 years old when he debuted at the Byron Nelson in 2014. This isn’t just a great win for the No. 1 golfer in the world, it also comes at the perfect moment with the season’s second major being his next scheduled event. The PGA Championship at Quail Hollow in North Carolina will be the next time Scheffler plays on the PGA Tour, and he’s looking to win the event for the first time in his career. His best finish was 2023, when he finished tied for second.

    "article_text": "SOLVA Archaeology Service in Belgium announced the recent discovery of ancient Roman artifacts and remains, including a well-preserved dog, in Velzeke. (Source: SOLVA Dienst Archeologie) Archaeologists recently discovered proof of a gladiatorial fight with a lion in an unexpectedtourist destination. York, a city in northern England known for its breathtaking medieval architecture, welcomes millions of visitors annually – but its history goes much further back than the Middle Ages. The area was inhabited by theancient Romans,who founded the city in 71 A.D. and named it Eboracum. ARCHAEOLOGISTS UNCOVER MASSIVE NUMBER OF HORSE SKELETONS AT 'IMPORTANT' ROMAN MILITARY SITE Until now, archaeologists weren't sure that gladiatorial fights with lions took place outside of Italy – and didn't have much evidence of these battles, other than Roman art depicting the fights. The recent findings, publicized in the journalPLOS One, analyze a puncture wound that was found on the pelvis of a gladiator buried in a York cemetery. A city in England known for its medieval architecture hosted a battle between a gladiator and a lion in the 3rd century, archaeologists say.(iStock; Getty Images) The gladiator lived during the 3rd century A.D. and was between 26 and 35 years old at the time of his death. Analyzing the man's wound, researchers found that the bite mark was made by a big cat, most likely a lion. LONG-LOST CAPITAL OF ANCIENT CIVILIZATION MAY HAVE FINALLY BEEN UNCOVERED, ARCHAEOLOGISTS SAY: 'UNIQUE FIND' \"Skeletal evidence associated with gladiatorial combat is rare, with most evidence deriving from written or visual sources,\" the article states. The bite mark was made by a big cat, most likely a lion. \"A single skeleton from a Roman cemetery outside of York where gladiators arguably were buried presented with unusual lesions.\" The piece noted, \"Investigation, including comparative work from modern zoological institutions, has demonstrated that these marks originate from large cat scavenging.\" The bite mark, found on the gladiator's pelvis, likely came from a lion.(Thompson et al., 2025, PLOS One/Handout via Reuters) The discovery is the \"first physical evidence for human-animal gladiatorial combat from the Roman period seenanywhere in Europe,\" according to the study's authors. Although researchers believe that the gladiator died in battle, they don't believe the pelvic puncture was the fatal blow. ‘ODD-LOOKING DEEP SEA FISH WASHES UP ON BEACH, SURPRISING LOCALS: ’WOULD NOT EXPECT TO RUN ACROSS' \"We don't think that this was the killing wound, as it would be possible to survive this injury, and it is in an unusual location for such a large cat,\" forensic anthropologist Tim Thompson of Maynooth University said in a statement to Reuters. \"We think it indicates the dragging of an incapacitated individual.\" The discovery marked the \"first physical evidence for human-animal gladiatorial combat from the Roman period seen anywhere in Europe,\" according to the study's authors.(Reuters/Will Dunham) John Pearce, a Roman archaeologist at King's College London and a co-author of the study, told Reuters that the cat may have been starved before the fight in order to increase its aggression. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER \"Very speculatively, from the gladiator's perspective, perhaps an approach like a matador's would have been applied - to dodge and progressively wound, so as to extendthe performance,\" Pearce said. \"In this case, clearly that ended unsuccessfully, with it being likely, given the position of the bite mark, that the lion is mauling or dragging this individual on the ground,\" he continued. For more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle \"At the end, when one or both were dead, there would be a burial for the gladiator and the use of the animal carcass for meat for the spectators.\" Though depictions of fights between lions and gladiators have been discovered, concrete proof of the battles has been scant.(Reuters/Will Dunham) The expert added that the discovery reflects the \"spectacle culture\" central toRoman life. \"This new analysis gives us very concrete and specific evidence of a human-animal violent encounter, either as combat or punishment, showing that the big cats caught inNorth Africawere shown and fought not only in Rome or Italy but also surprisingly widely, even if we don't know how frequently,\" Pearce concluded.

    "title": "Tesla doxxing attacks wrongly target nonowners across America",
    "article_text": "A 35-year-old man is accused of arson after a Cybertruck was burned at a Tesla dealership in Mesa, Ariz., on April 28, 2025. (KSAZ-TV) The recent surge of attacks on Tesla owners, dealerships and charging stations has morphed into a broader campaign of intimidation, fueled by weaponized personal data. But the fallout isn't limited to Tesla owners alone. Sites like \"Dogequest\" have published names, addresses and phone numbers supposedly belonging to Tesla owners, yet many victims never owned a Tesla or sold theirs years ago. Some were misidentified due to errors in public records or outdated databases, turning ordinary people into targets for harassment and threats. The site's operators have even demanded proof of sale from anyone seeking removal, putting the burden on innocent people to clear their names. As the DOJ and FBI label these attacks as domestic terrorism and ramp up investigations, the chilling reality is that anyone, even those only suspected of owning a Tesla, can find themselves exposed and at risk. Join The FREE \"CyberGuy Report\":Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to myfree \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\"when you sign up. A Tesla supercharger(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) On March 18, 2025, a hacker group launched \"Dogequest,\" a website featuring a searchable map of supposed Tesla owners and employees. The site didn't just list dealerships and charging stations; it exposed names, home addresses, phone numbers and emails, sometimes even in real time. The twist? Many of the people listed never owned a Tesla at all. The data fueling this attack came from public vehicle registration records and third-party databases, notorious for their inaccuracies. Some victims had sold their Teslas years ago. Others were never owners, just mistakenly linked by a typo, a recycled phone number or a database error. Yet they found themselves on a digital hit list, with their privacy and safety at risk. This isn't just an online problem. Firebombings at showrooms, bullets through dealership windows and threats to families have all been linked to these doxxing campaigns. Law enforcement, including the DOJ, now calls it domestic terrorism. And because the data is so often wrong, anyone could be next, regardless of whether you've ever set foot in a Tesla. \"Doxxing\" affecting Tesla and non-Tesla owners alike(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) If you think you're safe because you don't own a Tesla, think again. The same flawed data sources that misidentified Tesla owners exist for countless other products, memberships and affiliations. Today, it's electric cars; tomorrow, it could be political donors, healthcare workers or anyone else whose data is bought and sold. HERTZ DATA BREACH EXPOSES CUSTOMER INFORMATION Whether your personal data was exposed in a breach, leaked by someone with inside access or scraped from people-finder sites, you're at risk, not just if you own a Tesla, but even if you're misidentified. Here's how to reduce your exposure and protect yourself from becoming the next target of a doxxing attack. To help prevent your data from ending up in a breach or leak: Also known as people-search sites, these data brokers profit by compiling detailed personal profiles that are fully searchable and available to anyone for a small fee. They're among the most dangerous sources of exposed personal information online. Fortunately, they're also some of the easiest to tackle, especially with the help of a personal data removal service. These services send legally binding opt-out requests to people-search sites and other data brokers on your behalf, ensuring your information is taken down. Some services,like our No. 1 pick, even offer custom removal options, where privacy professionals handle complex cases that go beyond automated systems. While no service can guarantee complete data erasure from the internet, using a trusted removal service is a smart way to automate and maintain ongoing protection from hundreds of data-hungry sites over time. CHECK OUT MY TOP PICKS FOR DATA REMOVAL SERVICES HERE Hacker at work(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) While removing your data from brokers and minimizing online footprints are essential first steps, true safety in this new era of weaponized information also requires securing our digital infrastructure against both physical and virtual threats. Here are a few steps you can take to protect your data. Use two-factor authentication:Protect your vehicle’s account and associated emails withauthenticator appsrather than SMS, which is vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks. Use a VPN:Mask your IP address when accessing your vehicle’s apps onpublic Wi-Fito prevent location tracking and man-in-the-middle attacks. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location.For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on yourWindows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. Cabin cam caution:Disable Cabin Camera Recording under Data Sharing unless essential. While Tesla claims footage isn’t linked to identities by default, third-party app vulnerabilities could expose this data. Newer Teslas process cabin cam footage locally, but legacy models may still use cloud backups, so check your software version. Report doxxing or cyber harassment:If you’ve been doxxed or targeted online, don’t wait to take action. Report it to the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3),ic3.gov, or to local law enforcement, as many states have laws addressing doxxing, stalking and cyber harassment. File a police report with documented evidence (screenshots, URLs, timestamps). Also, for account-specific threats, contact Tesla customer service directly to report suspicious activity and secure your account. The reality is unsettling but not hopeless, and while the threats of our hyper-connected world can feel overwhelming, you don’t have to just hope you won’t be targeted. You can take control by arming yourself with knowledge, using the right tools, building smart habits like checking your digital footprint, using removal tools and staying alert to new threats because the attackers are organized, and it’s time we are, too.

    "title": "Pharma’s plastic prescription bottle problem gets a paper solution",
    "article_text": "Kurt Knutsson discusses how a paper pill bottle could revolutionize pharmacy packaging and cut plastic waste drastically. Have you ever stopped to think about what happens to those little orange pill bottles after you finish your prescription? Every year, around 200 billion of these bottles are produced worldwide, and sadly most of them end up in landfills. In the U.S. alone, about 4 to 5 billion plastic pill bottles are thrown away each year. That’s enough plastic to circle the Earth multiple times. While they might seem harmless, these bottles contribute significantly to the growing plastic pollution crisis because they’re often not recycled properly. Join The FREE \"CyberGuy Report\":Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to myfree \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\"when you sign up. Paper Tully Tube pill bottles (Parcel Health)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) Plastic has become the go-to material for packaging, including in medicine, because it’s cheap, durable and easy to produce. However, the environmental cost is huge, and the pharmaceutical industry has struggled to find a sustainable alternative. Enter theTully Tube, a revolutionary new pill bottle made mostly from 100% sustainably sourced paper. Developed by Parcel Health, this isn’t just any paper bottle. It’s the first one to meet the strict U.S. FDA regulations for food-contact packaging, making it safe to use for prescription medications. What makes the Tully Tube really impressive is how it balances sustainability with practicality. The body of the bottle is made from recyclable and compostable paper, which means it can break down naturally instead of piling up in landfills. The cap, which needs to be child-resistant for safety, is still made from plastic but uses recycled materials to reduce its environmental impact. Tully Tube (Parcel Health)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) STOP SORTING YOUR GARBAGE WITH THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY You might be wondering how a paper bottle can protect pills from moisture, heat or damage during shipping. The Tully Tube uses a clever three-layer construction. It’s coated with a food-safe compostable layer that keeps water and humidity out, ensuring your medication stays fresh and effective. When it’s time to toss the bottle, a patented pull tab makes it easy to separate the paper body from the plastic cap and neck. This means the paper part can be composted or recycled, while the plastic pieces can be recycled separately. It’s a simple but smart way to make sure every part of the bottle is handled properly at the end of its life. Tully Tube (Parcel Health)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) IS THIS TECHNOLOGY THE ANSWER TO CLEANING UP OUR OCEAN'S PLASTIC PROBLEM? One of the biggest hurdles for sustainable packaging is cost. Fortunately, the Tully Tube is priced competitively with traditional plastic bottles, so pharmacies don’t have to pay more to go green. Plus, because the paper surface is easier and cheaper to print on, pharmacies and pharmaceutical companies can customize the bottles with logos, designs or even characters to make the packaging more engaging for customers. From an environmental perspective, the Tully Tube reduces carbon emissions by about 30% compared to plastic bottles. That’s a significant cut in greenhouse gases, especially when you consider the billions of bottles used every year. Tully Tube (Parcel Health)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) AUTONOMOUS TRASH-GOBBLING ROBO BOAT WAGES WAR ON WATERWAY WASTE UVA Health is already leading the way by rolling out Tully Tubes across its system. This move is expected to eliminate millions of plastic bottles from their waste stream, showcasing how sustainable packaging can work even in industries with strict safety and regulatory standards. Their example proves that eco-friendly alternatives aren’t just theoretical, they’re ready for real-world use today. SUBSCRIBE TO KURT'S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES Tully Tube (Parcel Health)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) The Tully Tube may seem like a small innovation, but it has the potential to make a huge environmental difference. It challenges the longstanding reliance on plastic in the pharmaceutical industry by offering a practical, safe and sustainable alternative. As more hospitals and pharmacies consider adopting this new packaging, the impact could be enormous. Would you be open to using a paper pill bottle instead of the traditional plastic one?

    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. My suggestion: AmeriCorps is proof that if \"we hold hands and believe ... we can change anything we want to change,\"President Bill Clinton declared in 1999.But after more than 30 years of fraud, false claims and political racketeering, AmeriCorps – the federal paid volunteer oxymoron - just got hit by a DOGE torpedo. \"AmeriCorps has failed eight consecutive audits and is entrusted with over $1 billion in taxpayer dollars every year,\" White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly declared. The agency’s Office of Inspector General condemned it in 2014 for \"shocking waste of taxpayer funds, lax oversight, unauthorized contractual commitments and widespread noncompliance with rules, regulations and sound contracting practices.\" Things have only gotten worse since then. DOGE froze $400 million in grants to more than a thousand organizations, terminating more than 30,000 AmeriCorps members. Most AmeriCorps staffers have either quit or were placed on paid leave. TRUMP ADMIN GUTS AMERICORPS, CLINTON-ERA VOLUNTEER AGENCY THAT FAILED 8 CONSECUTIVE AUDITS AmeriCorps is a ripe DOGE target because its motto seems to be: \"Leave No Boondoggle Behind.\" In Missouri, AmeriCorps members released70 blue balloonsoutside a county courthouse to draw attention to the plight of abused children. Former President Bill Clinton with AmeriCorps youth during event at the University of Maryland. (Photo by Dirck Halstead/Getty Images) Hundreds of Playworks AmeriCorps members served as elementary school \"recess referees,\" bringing \"safe and inclusive play to all students.\" AmeriCorps members in the Florida \"Women in Distress\" program organized a poetry reading on the evils of domestic violence. Federal agencies are prohibitedfrom bankrolling political advocacy, but that doesn’t stop AmeriCorps. AmeriCorps aided and abetted ACORN, the Welfare Rights Organizing Coalition, the Political Asylum Project of Austin, the National Association of HUD Tenants and Planned Parenthood. AmeriCorps members have busied themselves passing out free condoms and providing escort services for women going to abortion clinics. I have chronicled AmeriCorps’ debacles over the decades inThe Wall Street Journal, USA Today, Playboy, and American Spectator. After Clinton bragged that AmeriCorps members had taught millions of kids how to read, I visited one of their premier literacy programs in West Virginia. AmeriCorps members emphaticallydenied teaching kids how to read –instead, they said they were simply exposing children to books. In Mississippi, I attended the opening of an AmeriCorps assistant teacher training program where recruits were only required to read at an 8th grade level. (The program’s grant application was chock-full of grammar and spelling errors.) According to AmeriCorps, \"national service returns up to $17 for every federal dollar invested\" in AmeriCorps. The formula event counts the stipends paid to AmeriCorps recruits – as if they would otherwise never get a paying job elsewhere. The tortured assumptions used to gin up the $17/$1 multiplier can’t be squared with having no clear idea where federal funds actually go. I saw this first-hand in 1999 when I visited a premier AmeriCorps program which received $600,000 to recruit people for food stamps. After the executive director of that Mississippi program evaded my questions, I alerted the Inspector General. Turns out that AmeriCorps money was spent on 14 ghost employees (including a local mayor) who did nothing for the program. The chief of that local agency wasconvicted and sentencedto 41 months in prison. AmeriCorps still struggles to distinguish between real and imaginary \"service.\" During the first Trump administration, the Inspector General warned of pervasive fraud involving \"teleservice\" — AmeriCorps members phoning in claims of the good deeds they supposedly did. Many grantees made no effort to verify the purported hours served. AmeriCorps management responded by recommending \"immediate contact between the member and individuals to whom services are rendered.\" This is AmeriCorps’ definition of \"close enough for government work\" altruism. The Government Accountability Office slammed AmeriCorps for failing to \"demonstrate results\" and ignoring \"the quality of service provided\" by its members. In Mississippi, I attended the opening of an AmeriCorps assistant teacher training program where recruits were only required to read at an 8th grade level. AmeriCorps apologists perpetually portray AmeriCorps recruits as financial martyrs. Pennsylvania Democrat Rep. Chrissy Houlahan boasts of her time with AmeriCorps, declaring, \"It’s a selfless act to serve, but you are gaining experience, and you are able to parlay that into opportunities in the civilian economy.\" But she was part of the Teach for America program whose AmeriCorps recruits were paid up to $80,000 a year plus benefits. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Most AmeriCorps members receive far less, but the overall package of stipends, fringe benefits and education awards exceed the wages collected by millions of Americans at the bottom of the pay scale. Being an AmeriCorps member is easier than making fries at McDonald’s. Olga Rodriguez lamented on the Huffington Post that serving in AmeriCorps was destroying her work ethic. AmeriCorps member Nicole Patterson, who received a Congressional Bronze Medal for Community Service, vented: \"I spent six weeks playing Scrabble and kickball for America. I spent another two months sitting in a tool shed for America.\" Former President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden pose with members of AmeriCorps on arrival at Joint Base Charleston in North Charleston, South Carolina, on January 19, 2025. (Photo by ROBERTO SCHMIDT/AFP via Getty Images) Democrats and liberals are seeking to ignite panic over the demise of AmeriCorps, but did these apologists fail arithmetic long ago? AmeriCorps had roughly 75,000 paid members before the DOGE purge. According to the Census Bureau, 75 million Americans formally volunteer with organizations each year. AmeriCorps amounts to barely one tenth of one percent of the total number of volunteers in this country. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP More than 20 states filed a lawsuit on April 29, challenging the Trump administration’s AmeriCorps cutbacks. According toFox News, \"AmeriCorps is expected to remain in existence, but essentially will be restarted from scratch.\" But there is no way to redeem a program that boasts of its balloon launches, poetry readings and condom giveaways. Congress and the Trump administration should admit that AmeriCorps will never be more than social work tinged with messianic delusions. There are a thousand times as many private volunteers who will assure that AmeriCorps members will not be missed. Taxpayers can no longer afford AmeriCorps’ endless virtue signaling.

    "title": "President Trump's Alaska pipeline could fuel America's energy needs and his legacy",
    "article_text": "West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the importance of diversifying American energy for national security purposes and why he supports the president unleashing coal energy. When President Donald J. Trump stood before a joint session of Congress earlier this year and declaredAlaska LNGa top national priority, he sent a strong signal to the world that America would once again act boldly to unleash the full might of its energy potential. If his administration can follow through on that vision and continue to move at the speed that has so far defined his second term, the Alaska LNG pipeline will be one of the defining achievements of his presidency. Before the end of President Trump’s second term, Alaska LNG — a project that was once seen as an improbable long shot — will be pumping energy out of the ground, supporting American consumers in Alaska, Alaska’s crucial military bases and then our Asian allies in the Pacific. The proposed pipeline, stretching over 800 miles from the North Slope to the southern coast of Alaska is a strategic masterstroke. It reflects exactly what President Trump’s administration is all about: prioritizing American jobs and strengthening our nation on the world stage. When operational, the Alaska Gasline Development Corporation (AGDC) estimates thepipelinecould carry each day at 3.5 billion cubic feet per day. To put that in perspective, just this one project could produce nearly all the natural gas that Russia exports to the world. This is not just a theoretical pipe dream. Alaska LNG has already overcome the bureaucratic and legal red tape that is typically the most time-consuming part of the process, securing its permits and defeating every legal challenge. Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy recently held talks in Taiwan, Thailand, South Korea, and Japan and has already begun to secure commitments from these potential customers. According to Governor Dunleavy, the goal is for the pipeline to be in place in two and a half years withgas flowingthrough it. NORTHERN HIGHLIGHTS: ALASKA'S ENERGY, SECURITY POLICIES ARE THE GUIDE FEDS NEEDS AMID TRANSITION, GROUP SAYS As soon as the project is operational,Alaska LNGwill be serving Alaskans. For too long, Alaska has sat on an ocean of energy potential without the infrastructure to realize its full value. The Alaska LNG pipeline will change that, bringing in billions of investment, tens of thousands of jobs, and much-needed revenue to a state that has been economically sidelined by D.C. bureaucrats and green agenda zealots. For rural communities who would otherwise be forced to rely on imported fuel, the pipeline promises real energy security with affordable and reliable power for families and businesses. But the benefits won’t stop at the Alaskan border. While lowering global energy prices, this massive project will boost American exports and make a major dent in our trade deficit. Alaska LNG pipeline will give the United States a powerful new lever in global energy markets, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. Our allies —Japan, South Korea, Taiwan —are all energy-hungry nations with a growing appetite for natural gas. Instead of relying on our being at the mercy of Russian and Middle Eastern exporters, they can look to the United States and Alaska. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP That dynamic will give the United States astrategic advantagein competition against China. For years, Beijing has used its dominance in critical industries and energy investments to bully smaller nations and manipulate global markets. The Alaska LNG pipeline is a direct counterpunch. By supplying reliable American energy to China’s neighbors, we reduce their dependence on the CCP and strengthen the geopolitical balance in our favor. President Trump understands that Alaska’s energy will strengthen our nation’s leverage and security. At home, President Trump will not only lower energy prices but also secure his vision of energy independence. America will never be begging OPEC for oil or watching our gas prices skyrocket because of international disruptions again. The cynics and the doubters have long thrown cold water on the Alaska LNG project. But President Trump understands what our nation is capable of and can once again prove them wrong. If leaders in his administration, like Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, continue to prioritize this project, the Alaska LNG pipeline will be built and pumping before the end of his current term. That will not just be a win, but a major legacy achievement for the President. The Alaska LNG Project is the kind of big, bold project that only a leader like Trump could deliver. It is only appropriate that President Trump be there to preside over its groundbreaking before his term ends.",

    "title": "Merit over mandates: Trump should look to college sports as his winning model for DEI",
    "article_text": "Is today's potential \"Black Monday\" the beginning of the end or can the Trump Administration's end game turn things around? Plus, Will sits down with Robby Starbuck, the man behind the dismantling of DEI and 'Woke' policies in corporate America. President Trump is vehemently opposed to DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion). He made it clear during his inaugural address that DEI will no longer be part of the federal government staffing process. He views DEI as discriminatory, advocating for race-blind and merit-based hiring and evaluation, focusing on supporting and rewarding the best talent available. When one looks more closely at what the president opposes about DEI, he is focused on the dark side of DEI, namely tokenism. This is when DEI is used to define outcomes and reward performance that does not align with merit, rather than create opportunities. Yet there already exists a model for DEI oncollege campusesthat would be consistent with the president’s views, namely, how student athletes are recruited for college sports and how coaches are developed and hired. DEFUNDING DEI: HERE'S HOW THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS UNDONE BIDEN'S VERY PRIZED PROGRAMS Every college sport’s team strives to be the very best. They seek to compete at the highest level, winning conference titles, and for some, national championships. As anyone who has played a sport at some point in their life, theskills of the participantsare critical factors for success on the playing field. That is why recruiting is such an important activity of college coaches and their staff. Take for example, men’s college basketball, which recently completed their season. Both ESPN and 247 Sports rank the top high school seniors, providing an evaluation of their performance that benefits coaches and informs fans. These rankings are then used to assess the quality of each college’s incoming freshman class, a reasonable predictor of future success on the court. Of course, the ease at which players can move between schools via the transfer portal creates a cloud of uncertainty around such school rankings. Names, Images, and Likeness (NIL) contracts also play a critical role in where players choose to play, as the once scorned \"pay to play\" model has now become the norm. Nonetheless, attracting the very best talent to a team, independent of how it is done, is always a high priority to enable success on the court. Yet talent on the court can be squandered without quality coaching. The primary objective of every athletic director is to facilitate successful programs that develop student-athletes into good citizens, both on and off the court. Their objective is to hire the best available coaches who can build a winning culture. This means that hiring decisions are naturally driven by merit. However, with a highly diverse pool of candidates to pick from, diversity is naturally built into the merit-based selection process. Of greater importance is that the players themselves are recruitedbased on merit. They all want to be part of winning programs. Striving to have winning programs demands winning coaches, all of which takes time to develop and nurture. What college sports teach is that success comes from using merit as the primary metric to assemble teams and coaching staff. It also tells us that a large pool of potential (and interested) student athletes who wish to become future coaches means that there are many applicants to draw from, a key driver for permitting coaching staffs to resemble the pool of players. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The lesson learned here is that creating diverse campuses based on merit demands a diverse pipeline. This does not begin at faculty and student recruiting committees and in DEI offices on campuses, but in K-12 schools, and perhaps in the homes of these children, where future leaders are being nurtured and honed. Such efforts are the long game for enhancing diversity on campuses, and in society. Attempts to sidestep the necessary investments to create a high-quality pipeline leads to suboptimal outcomes. The Supreme Court ruling ending affirmative action admissions and actions taken by the University of Michigan and the challenges that they had with their DEI programs suggest that shortcuts are not the solution. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As aspirational as diversity is, without merit,diversityis tainted. The two can and should walk together, so that when diversity excels, merit stands tall with it, just as it does on the playing fields in college sports. College sports provides an informative model for enhancing diversity within a merit-based system.  Such lessons can be used across the entire campus in academia, to yield a diverse student body and faculty, while maintaining the highest standards of merit that everyone expects, deserves, and respects. This is what the president values, and why college sports are the ideal model for him to advocate for across college campuses.

On Monday, the Alphabet company finally provided a peek at the commercial side of the fleet. Waymo said Monday,as part of a larger announcement, that it has more than 1,500 commercial robotaxis in operation. And work is underway to expand it through a multi-million-dollar investment with Magna to build more than 2,000 autonomous I-Pace vehicles at a new factory in Arizona. Waymo has worked with Magna for years, namely at a now closed facility in Detroit. The new 239,000-square-foot factory in the Phoenix suburb of Mesa is strategically located in the one of Waymo’s robotaxi markets and close to its other service areas across San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Austin. A Waymo spokesperson told TechCrunch the company looked at other locations, but ultimately it chose Mesa for its proximity to other markets and because the consistent weather made it ideal for the validation process required before the robotaxis can be used by the public. Waymo said in a blog post announcing the factory that it received final delivery from Jaguar earlier this year. From here, contract builder Magna and Waymo take over to integrate the self-driving system into the vehicles. Waymo emphasized a new process designed to speed up the production-to-validation-to-public use process, noting that the AVs can drive themselves out of the facility and directly into service. “In fact, these vehicles can pick up their first public passengers less than 30 minutes after leaving the factory,” Waymo said in its blog post. The company said that vehicles intended for other cities can be deployed into public service in a matter of hours after being shipped to their local depot. The Mesa factory is designed to handle other vehicle platforms, notably to integrate the sixth-generation of Waymo’s self-driving system into the Zeekr RT later this year. The plant will introduce an automated assembly line and other efficiencies over time, according to the company, which noted that the plant will be capable of building tens of thousands of fully autonomous Waymo vehicles per year when operating at full capacity.

It also bans practices such as “bait-and-switch pricing” and any actions that conceal or misrepresent total prices and fees. In a newly published FAQ, the FTC offers a guide for these types of businesses, providing detailed information about pricing transparency. The rule willimpact businesses, including live event ticket sellers and short-term lodging providers, like hotels, motels, Airbnb, or VRBO. Third-party platforms, resellers, and travel agents are also covered by the new regulation. (Airbnb alreadyupdated its service in advance of this new regulationto show users the total cost of their stay upfront.) According to the FTC: Also included in the FTC’s new FAQ are the types of fees that can be excluded, such as taxes or government fees, shipping charges, and charges for optional goods or services people may select to buy as part of the same transaction. (Note that handling charges aren’t on this list.) However, the FTC notes that businesses must disclose that it has excluded charges from the total price before asking for payment. For example, if a business excludes shipping charges from the advertised price, it’s required to clearly state the amount and purpose of those charges. The FTC first passed the rule in December 2024, a landmark regulation that marked a significant win for consumers who have been frustrated for years about hidden fees.

About one in six American adults already use chatbots for health advice at least monthly,according to one recent survey. But placing too much trust in chatbots’ outputs can be risky, in part because people struggle to know what information to give chatbots for the best possible health recommendations,according to a recent Oxford-led study. “The study revealed a two-way communication breakdown,” Adam Mahdi, director of graduate studies at the Oxford Internet Institute and a co-author of the study, told TechCrunch. “Those using [chatbots] didn’t make better decisions than participants who relied on traditional methods like online searches or their own judgment.” For the study, the authors recruited around 1,300 people in the U.K. and gave them medical scenarios written by a group of doctors. The participants were tasked with identifying potential health conditions in the scenarios and using chatbots, as well as their own methods, to figure out possible courses of action (e.g., seeing a doctor or going to the hospital). The participants used the default AI model powering ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as well as Cohere’s Command R+ and Meta’s Llama 3, which once underpinned the company’s Meta AI assistant. According to the authors, the chatbots not only made the participants less likely to identify a relevant health condition, but it also made them more likely to underestimate the severity of the conditions they did identify. Mahdi said that the participants often omitted key details when querying the chatbots or received answers that were difficult to interpret. “[T]he responses they received [from the chatbots] frequently combined good and poor recommendations,” he added. “Current evaluation methods for [chatbots] do not reflect the complexity of interacting with human users.” The findings come as tech companies increasingly push AI as a way to improve health outcomes. Apple isreportedlydeveloping an AI tool that can dispense advice related to exercise, diet, and sleep. Amazon is exploring an AI-based way to analyze medical databases for “social determinants of health.” And Microsoft is helping build AI to triage messages to care providers sent from patients. But as TechCrunch haspreviously reported, both professionals and patients are mixed as to whether AI is ready for higher-risk health applications. The American Medical Association recommends against physician use of chatbots like ChatGPT for assistance with clinical decisions, and major AI companies, including OpenAI, warn against making diagnoses based on their chatbots’ outputs. “We would recommend relying on trusted sources of information for healthcare decisions,” Mahdi said. “Current evaluation methods for [chatbots] do not reflect the complexity of interacting with human users. Like clinical trials for new medications, [chatbot] systems should be tested in the real world before being deployed.” Topics AI Editor Get inside access to Europe’s top investment minds — with leaders from Monzo, Accel, Paladin Group, and more — plus top-tier networking at StrictlyVC London.

Other investors in the round include Khosla Ventures and Madrona. Based in San Francisco,Recraft previously raiseda $12 million Series A led by Khosla in 2024. The San Francisco-based startup says it recently passed $5 million in ARR and 4 million users. The startup caught industry attention when its model, codenamed “red_panda,” topped the Artificial Analysis benchmark last year. This was actually Recraft’s V3, which earned its name because early users kept generating images of the cute mammal, Recraft’s founder and CEO Anna Veronika Dorogush told TechCrunch. Recraft says it builds its own models from scratch and competes with other image generators like Midjourney, Adobe Firefly, Stable Diffusion, and Black Forest Labs, Dorogush said. But Recraft’s AI particularly excels at generating images for brands. That means allowing them to place logos exactly where needed without extra editing, or easily generating new marketing materials like brochures and posters that comply with existing branding guidelines. It’s an area where existing image models often fall short, according to Dorogush. That puts Recraft closer to competing with design tools like Canva, which also has anAI generatorfor branding purposes. Recraft is also notable for having a solo female founder and CEO. Dorogush founded Recraft after years of working on machine learning at Yandex — the Russian Google competitor — along with prior stints at Google and Microsoft. Before building AI models, Dorogush worked as a professional model while she earned a math and computer science degree at one of Russia’s top universities. She ended up leaving that line of work but says it taught her that simply working hard — like showing up to endless casting calls — wasn’t enough. “The biggest lesson from that time was that grinding isn’t everything,” Dorogush said. “Now when building a company, I know that to succeed, we have to be excellent at what’s mission-critical.

The I/O session title hints at significant changes in store for Android’s design system, which will evolve from “Material 3” to “Material Design 3 Expressive.” The leaked blog post indicates that Google’s updated design will focus on creating interfaces that “connect with people on an emotional level.” Design system updates like this influence how app developers build for the platform and customize their experiences for users, affecting the overall feel of what it’s like to use an Android device. While still little is known about the specifics of how Material 3 Expressive will be implemented, the blog post offered some high-level details, like how the new system is characterized by “bold use of shape and color — creating delightful user experiences.” Firstintroduced in 2014, Material Design is Google’s open source design system that details how to create user interfaces for Android applications, including in areas like visual, motion, and interaction design. The system’s next biggestupdate was revealedin May 2021 as “Material You” (also known as Material 3), offering an adaptive interface that allowed users to personalize the Android interface in new ways. For instance, if you updated your Android wallpaper, the entire Android experience would also update to match its color scheme. Material 3 Expressive may not be as big an overhaul, but an iteration on the Material You language. The leaked blog post focused more on the research and reasoning behind the update, noting how people tended to prefer a more expressive design that improves usability when studied. This type of design draws attention to key elements and important user actions, Google noted, leading to “significant gains in performance.” Of note, the company said this type of design also makes using apps easier for older adults, essentially leveling the playing field for users of all ages. However, Google pointed out that expressive design isn’t necessarily a “one-size fits all solution,” and different app makers will still need to respect other well-established design patterns and standards when customizing their app’s interface. Google’s blog post was first spotted by9to5Googleand has since been saved by theWayback Machine. Though the company quickly pulled the post down, the I/O session titled “Build next-level UX with Material 3 Expressive” shows that Google is poised to reveal the updated design system later this month at its developer conference. According to the session’s description, developers at I/O will learn to use “new emotional design patterns” to boost engagement, usability, and desire for their product. The company also plans on sharing files and alpha code at that time, so developers can begin to experiment with the changes ahead of a public release.

The problems in question are wide-ranging, from medicine and cybersecurity to materials science and chemistry. But first, there are very practical problems to be solved, such as developing chips that can reliably host large numbers of qubits — short for quantum bits, the fundamental unit of information in quantum computing. As usual in a high-stakes tech race with an uncertain time horizon, tech giants such as Google and Microsoft are at the forefront. Yet startups are also set to play an important role, especially tackling bottlenecks like connectivity and error correction that are critical for scaling quantum systems. But some startups and smaller tech companies are taking on the chip challenge head-on and deserve mention alongside the more attention-grabbing efforts from industry giants. While Big Tech projects typically boast the highest qubit counts, rethinking designs from first principles and using different approaches could yield equally promising results. Here are some of the companies behind the main quantum chip projects that are worth tracking. Akhetonicsis a German photonics startup working on anall-optical, general-purpose chip— a contrarian bet in a field where most focus on narrower applications. This bold version and its first-principles approach helped the company raisea €6 million seed funding roundled by Matterwave Ventures in November 2024. Alice & Bobis a French startup that raiseda $104 million Series B round of fundingin January 2025 to continue working toward building a “fault tolerant” quantum computer. Unlike companies focusing only on chips, Alice & Bob is developing a full quantum computing system. To do so, it relies oncat qubits, a type of superconducting qubit designed to reduce errors and simplify error correction. Amazon officially joined the quantum chip race in early 2025 when AWSintroduced Ocelot, developed in partnership with the California Institute of Technology. While this is the company’s first quantum chip, AWS had previouslylaunched Braket, a quantum computing service, in partnership with D-Wave, IonQ, Rigetti, and others. Atom Computingis a U.S. company building quantum computers with arrays of optically trapped neutral atoms. At the Microsoft Ignite 2024 conference, Microsoft and Atom Computing announced plans tolaunch a commercial quantum computerin 2025. D-Waveis a quantum computing company whose latest flagship system, theAdvantage2 prototype, relies on a process calledquantum annealing, which uses quantum physics to find the most stable, lowest-energy arrangements of elements to figure out the best mix for a given problem. Founded in 1999 as a spinoff from the University of British Columbia in Canada, D-Wave is now a public company listed on the NYSE. Illinois-basedEeroQis a startupbetting on heliumfor its quantum chip design. Having raised a $7.25 million seed funding round in 2022 and received regional public support, the company made a $1.1 million commitment in September 2024 towardexpanding its HQin Chicago’s Humboldt Park. In April 2025, Fujitsu and Japanese research institution RIKEN announced having developeda 256-qubit superconducting quantum computerat the RIKEN RQC-FUJITSU Collaboration Center, up from a 64-qubit iteration in 2023. In December 2024, Googleannounced Willow, its latest quantum computing chip. Google didn’t stop at saying Willow was better than its predecessor, Sycamore, or at describing it as “a major breakthrough in quantum error correction.” In a statement thatmade headlines, Google Quantum AI founder Hartmut Neven wrote that Willow’s performance lent “credence to the notion that quantum computation occurs in many parallel universes.” IBM’s quantum efforts includeCondor, its milestone superconducting chip for scaling up to 1,121 qubits, andHeron, a 156-qubit processor focused on improved performance and lower error rates. Founded in 2007,Infleqtion(formerly ColdQuanta) is a US-based company developing quantum computers based on neutral atom technology. Intel is developing quantum computers based onsilicon spin qubits. In June 2023, it unveiled Tunnel Falls, a 12-qubit research chip, and said a next-generation quantum chip based on Tunnel Falls was expected to be released in 2024, but this hasn’t happened. IonQis a publicly listed U.S. company developing trapped-ion quantum computers, including theIonQ Forte. After going publicvia a SPACin late 2021, itacquired Canadian networking specialist Entangled Networks. IQMis a Finnish startup building superconducting quantum computers and is a spinout of the Aalto University and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. It received funding in its early days from the Business Finland government agency, followed by additional supportfrom the EIC Accelerator program. In 2022, IQM raised €128 million in Series A2 funding led by World Fund, adding to the€39 million led by MIG Fondsit had raised in 2020 as part of what was then its Series A.

Today, however, the region is home to several startups that have reached billion-dollar valuations. Some of these startups, propelled into the spotlight by cross-border expansion, are now recognized beyond their home countries, with Nubank notablygoing public in the U.S. Yet, there is a broader cohort of Latin American scale-ups that deserve attention; many in fintech, but not exclusively. Other important sectors include e-commerce, health tech, logistics, proptech, and SaaS. Some homegrown unicorns may currently hold “paper valuations” from rounds that were raised during the 2021 peak, but the point still stands: They are worth knowing, and many could recover alongside the market, as VC investment in Latin Americademonstrated resilience in 2024. As a group, these unicorns also reflect Latin America’s multiple startup hubs. While Brazil and Mexico remain leaders in numbers, unicorns have also emerged from Argentina, Colombia, Chile, and Uruguay, further strengthening these ecosystems. And the newest one raised $127 million in April. Let’s take a closer look at the top Latin American unicorns by valuation — although the oldest price tags often need to be taken with a grain of salt. With backers including General Catalyst and SoftBank, Kavak is a Mexico-based e-commerce platform to buy and sell used cars online. Once valuedat $8.7 billionafter a Series E round that doubled its valuation in 2021, Kavak saw its valuationslashed by $6.5 billionfollowing expansion difficulties and layoffs. After raising a $127 million equity round and securing two $200 million debt facilities in March 2025, the company aims to position itself for a potential IPO within the next three to five years. Ualáis an Argentine neobank whose fintech services include loans, investments, payment solutions, and credit scoring technology. Founded in 2017, itbecame a unicornwith its$350 million Series D in 2021. Since then, it raised a $300 million Series E ata $2.75 billion post-money valuation, followed by a second close in March 2025 with anadditional $66 millionbringing its post-money valuation to $2.81 billion. Briefly known asBlitzPayand foundedby former PayPal employees, Clip is theSquare of Latin America, with POS devices and fintech solutions for businesses. Clip became a unicorn in 2021 following a$250 million roundled by SoftBank and Viking, and maintained this status since then. The $100 million round it raisedin June 2024confirmed its $2 billion valuation as the company was “on the brink of profitability,” its CEOtold Bloomberg. Creditas is a Brazilian fintech player specializing in loans, including consumer credit. Its latest round of funding was a $260 million Series F in January 2022 valuing the Brazilian lenderat $4.8 billion, up from $1.75 billion in December 2020. The Series F was led by Fidelity, with participation from new and existing backers, including Kaszek Ventures, QED Investors, and SoftBank. It wasextended in July 2022at the same valuation, allowing Creditas tobuy the Brazilian license of Andorran bank Andbankfor some $93 million. Unico is a Brazilian ID tech startup, and one of Latin America’s largest SaaS companies. Its $2.6 billion valuation is more recent than many on this list. It came from the $100 million Series D the company raisedin April 2022. The round was led by Goldman Sachs, with participation from existing investors General Atlantic and SoftBank Latin America Fund. Coming out of Colombia, Rappi is an on-demand delivery platform that becamea super appand expanded into multiple countries. Its rise solidified before the pandemic: In 2019, it raiseda $1 billion investmentfrom SoftBank. But its $5.25 billion valuation was attached to theround of more than $500 millionit secured in July 2021. Since then, Rappi has operated in a more challenging environment, conducting multiple rounds oflayoffsand facing changinggig economy legislation in Mexico, where it now plans toinvest $110 millionto boost its operations. However, the company stillvery much hopes to IPOandhired a CFOto prepare for that endeavor after reaching break-even for the first time in late 2023. QuintoAndar is a Brazilian proptech company focused on the rental and sale of residential real estate. With commercial activities insix Latin American countriesanda tech hub in Europe, it made several acquisitions and grew into a group with a headcount of more than 3,500 people. In 2021, the startup was busy on the fundraising front: Less than three months after announcinga $300 million Series E at a $4 billion valuation, QuintoAndar raised an additional $120 millionat a $5.1 billion valuation. With$755 millionraised to date, its cap table includes Kaszek, General Atlantic, SoftBank, and Tencent. Branded as Tiendanube in Spanish-speaking markets, Nuvemshop is a Brazilian e-commerce platform designed for SMEs and entrepreneurs to sell products and services online — or in short,“Latin America’s answer to Shopify.” Its latest known valuation of $3.1 billion comes from the$500 million Series E mega-roundco-led by Insight Partners and Tiger Global Management that it raised in August 2021, only a few months after itsAccel-led $90 million Series D. Loft is a Brazilian proptech companysupported by big Silicon Valley names since its genesis in 2018. Loft’s $175 million Series C was co-led by a16z and Vulcan Capital in 2020. A $425 million Series D led by New York-based D1 Capital Partners followed in March 2021, and its extension in April 2021 valued the companyat $2.9 billion. The digital real estate platform wasn’t immune to the market turn. It conductedtwo rounds of layoffs in 2022butdenied having raised a down roundin November 2022. In 2023, after fresh funding from asovereign fund in the Middle East” at an undisclosed valuation and another round of layoffs, it claimed tohave reached break-even. Bitso is a Latin American cryptocurrency exchange that also facilitates cross-border payments. In May 2021, it secured a $250 million Series C round valuing the company at $2.2 billion and co-led by Tiger Global and Coatue, with participation from new and existing investors, including Kaszek andQED. Known for its InfinitePay and Jim.com brands, CloudWalk is a Brazilian payment infrastructure company (not to be confused with theChinese facial-recognition software companyby the same name). CloudWalk’s $2.15 billion valuation resulted from a $150 million Series C led by Coatue in November 2021. Since then, CloudWalk achieved its first full year of profitabilityin 2023and closed 2024with $497 million in revenue. Loggi is a Brazil-based logistics company known for itsfocus on last-mile delivery. Its backers include Monashees, Qualcomm Ventures, and SoftBank. Its latest funding round wasa $205 million Series Fled by CapSur Capital in March 2021 at a valuation close to $2 billion. Wildlife Studios is a Brazilian mobile gaming company. It was co-founded byVictor Lazarte, now also a general partner at Benchmark, the VC firm that led Wildlife Studios’$60 million Series Ain 2019 at a $1.3 billion valuation. Less than a year later, the startup reached anearly $3 billion valuationfrom its Series B round. In a candid conversation onstageat Slush 2023, Lazarte said that, in retrospect, raising too much capital at too high a valuation so fast was a “mistake.” In June 2023, the company announced that former Amazon executive Peter Hill wouldreplace Lazarte as CEO. It also conductedseveral rounds of layoffs. C6 Bank is a Brazilian digital bank. Unlike some competitors, it hasn’t expanded beyond Brazil, where it has more than 35 million clients. C6 was valued at$2.28 billionin December 2020, six months before JPMorgan Chase acquired 40% ownership of the neobank in 2021. Afterincreasing its stakein 2023, it now owns 46% of C6, which had itsfirst-ever profitable year in 2024. Bets are still open onwho may join the listand how the rankings might be reordered, so we’ll make sure to keep it updated.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Andurilannouncedits ninth acquisition on Monday with the purchase of Dublin’s Klas, makers of ruggedized edge computing equipment for the military and first responders. Anduril wouldn’t reveal financial details of the deal, and the purchase is subject to regulatory approval, but the company did say that Klas employs 150 people. Relatedly, on Monday, Anduril alsoannounceda new product called Menace-T. We’ll give the company points for the interesting product name, especially for a device that’s really just a bundle of compute/network connectivity, rather than, say, a fantasy-style broadsword. (Compare the name Menace to Lockheed Martin’s C2BMC, the name for its Command, Control, Battle Management & Communications products.) Klas’ flagship product, known as Voyager, is the ruggedized family of compute and networking systems that Anduril had already been using in its other Menace command center products. Voyager had also already been integrated with Anduril’s flagship Lattice software. Lattice brings sensors and AI to devices to perform tasks like object identification. But while most of us envision a portable command system being the size of a truck — which many are — Menace-T fits into two carry-on cases that can be set up by one person in minutes, the company says. Its goal is to bring edge computing and communications to off-grid and/or inhospitable environments. Anduril says it’s already being used in military ground vehicles and maritime vessels. One interesting use case for Menace-T is compute/communications support for the military’s Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) VR headsets. The IVAS project was initially awarded to Microsoft in 2018 after it pitched the idea of developing ruggedized HoloLens headsets for soldiers. The project was awarded an initial $21.9 billion budget. But after years of technical struggles,Anduril took control of the troubled contractin February — although Microsoft remains a cloud partner. Lattice had already been added to Microsoft’s IVAS headsets, bringing computer vision AI that helps the headset detect, track, and classify objects. Now Anduril thinks that the Klas technology that powers its Menace-T product can solve some of IVAS’s other historic problems, like reliable data processing. With IVAS, “there are scenarios where those soldiers need to communicate with the tactical edge to send data, to receive data, to task autonomous systems, and that’s a place where the Klas technology can help,” Tom Keane, SVP of Engineering, said at a press conference. “Klas has already been supplying technology to IVAS for several years in that context. So we expect to do more there.” Beyond Anduril’s military objectives, there are a host of other computer vision situations that are not practical until more powerful edge computing becomes available. This ranges from automotive to industrial — or even areaslike pollution monitoring. While Anduril is clearly focusing on military and related fields like law enforcement — with all the rhetoric that implies — should it solve the edge computing issue for IVAS, there are at least as many commercial possibilities for the tech. Anduril hasn’t ruled out one day pursuing those as well. “The technology and products from Klas have many use cases: military, national security, law enforcement, autonomy and more.  Anduril, together with our partners, will continue to support customers [with] a wide array of use cases,” Keane told TechCrunch.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Mistral AI, the French company behind AI assistant Le Chat and several foundational models, is officially regarded as one ofFrance’s most promising tech startupsand isarguably the only European company that could compete with OpenAI. But compared to its $6 billion valuation, its global market share is still relatively low. However, the recent launch of its chat assistant on mobile app stores was met with some hype, particularly in its home country. “Go and download Le Chat, which is made by Mistral, rather than ChatGPT by OpenAI — or something else,” French president Emmanuel Macron saidin a TV interviewahead of the AI Action Summit in Paris. While this wave of attention may be encouraging, Mistral AI still faces challenges in competing with the likes of OpenAI — and in doing so while keeping up with its self-definition as “the world’s greenest and leading independent AI lab.” Mistral AI has raised significant amounts of funding since its creation in 2023 with the ambition to “put frontier AI in the hands of everyone.” While this isn’t a direct jab at OpenAI, the slogan is meant to highlight the company’s advocacy for openness in AI. Its alternative to ChatGPT, chat assistant Le Chat, is now alsoavailable on iOS and Android. It reached1 million downloadsin the two weeks following its mobile release, even grabbing France’s top spot for free downloads on the iOS App Store. This comes in addition to Mistral AI’s suite of models, which includes: In March 2025, the companyintroduced Mistral OCR, an optical character recognition (OCR) API that can turn any PDF into a text file to make it easier for AI models to ingest. Mistral AI’s three founders share a background in AI research at major U.S. tech companies with significant operations in Paris. CEO Arthur Mensch used to work at Google’s DeepMind, while CTO Timothée Lacroix and chief scientist officer Guillaume Lample are former Meta staffers. Co-founding advisers also includeJean-Charles Samuelian-Werve(also a board member) and Charles Gorintin from health insurance startup Alan, as well as former digital minister Cédric O, whichcaused controversydue to his previous role. Not all of them. Mistral AI differentiates its premier models, whoseweightsare not available for commercial purposes, from its free models, for which it provides weight access under the Apache 2.0 license. Free models include research models such as Mistral NeMo, which was built in collaboration with Nvidia that the startupopen-sourcedin July 2024. While many of Mistral AI’s offerings are free ornow have free tiers, Mistral AI plans to drive some revenue from Le Chat’s paid tiers. Introduced in February 2025, Le Chat’s Pro plan is priced at $14.99 a month. On the purely B2B side, Mistral AI monetizes its premier models through APIs with usage-based pricing. Enterprises can also license these models, and the company likely also generates a significant share of its revenue from its strategic partnerships, some of which it highlightedduring the Paris AI Summit. Overall, however, Mistral AI’s revenue is reportedly still in the eight-digit range, according to multiple sources. In 2024, Mistral AI entered a deal with Microsoft that included a strategic partnership for distributing its AI models through Microsoft’s Azure platform and a €15 million investment. The U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)swiftly concludedthat the deal didn’t qualify for investigation due to its small size. However, it also sparked somecriticismin the EU. In January 2025, Mistral AIsigned a deal with press agency Agence France-Presse(AFP) to let Chat query the AFP’s entire text archive dating back to 1983. Mistral AI also secured strategic partnerships with France’sarmyandjob agency,shipping giant CMA, German defense tech startupHelsing,IBM,Orange, andStellantis. As of February 2025, Mistral AI raised around €1 billion in capital to date, approximately $1.04 billion at the current exchange rate. This includes some debt financing, as well as several equity financing rounds raised in close succession. In June 2023, and before it even released its first models, Mistral AI raised arecord $112 million seed roundled by Lightspeed Venture Partners. Sources at the time said the seed round —Europe’s largest ever— valued the then-one-month-old startup at $260 million. Other investors in this seed round included Bpifrance, Eric Schmidt, Exor Ventures, First Minute Capital, Headline, JCDecaux Holding, La Famiglia, LocalGlobe, Motier Ventures, Rodolphe Saadé, Sofina, and Xavier Niel. Only six months later, it closeda Series A of €385 million($415 million at the time), at a reported valuation of $2 billion. The round was led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), with participation from existing backer Lightspeed, as well as BNP Paribas, CMA-CGM, Conviction, Elad Gil, General Catalyst, and Salesforce. The$16.3 million convertible investmentthat Microsoft made in Mistral AI as part of their partnership announced in February 2024 was presented as a Series A extension, implying an unchanged valuation. In June 2024, Mistral AI then raised€600 million in a mix of equity and debt(around $640 million at the exchange rate at the time). Thelong-rumored roundwas led by General Catalyst at a $6 billion valuation, with notable investors, including Cisco, IBM, Nvidia, Samsung Venture Investment Corporation, and others. Mistral is “not for sale,”Mensch said in January 2025 at the World Economic Forum in Davos. “Of course, [an IPO is] the plan.” This makes sense, given how much the startup has raised so far: Even a large sale may not provide high enough multiples for its investors, not to mention sovereignty concerns depending on the acquirer. However, the only way to definitely squash persistent acquisition rumors is to scale its revenue to levels that could even remotely justify its nearly $6 billion valuation. Either way, stay tuned.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us General Fusion laid off at least 25% of its employees last week, just days after hitting a key milestone for itslatest fusion demonstration device. CEO Greg Twinney posted an open letter on the company’s website Monday saying that while its new LM26 device had been able to compress a plasma — something necessary for fusion conditions —General Fusionwas running short of money. He wrote, “[T]oday’s funding landscape is more challenging than ever as investors and governments navigate a rapidly shifting and uncertain political and market climate.” The 23-year-old company, which many still describe as a startup, is Canada’s leading entrant in the race for commercial fusion power. It has raised $440 million, according to PitchBook, including a $22.66 million round that closed in July. Backers include Jeff Bezos, Temasek, and BDC Capital. But that money hasn’t been enough for the company to show that its unique approach to fusion is viable. General Fusion’s plight highlights the challenges that face the fusion industry. To date, only one device has been able to hit so-called scientific breakeven, a milestone that’s significant historically but not commercially. To hit commercial breakeven, reactors need to produce dozens of times more energy than has been demonstrated so far. The road to those milestones has proven extraordinarily costly. Though General Fusion’s tally may seem impressive, it ismiddle of the pack.Commonwealth Fusion Systemshas raised over $2 billion,Helionhas pulled in over $1 billion, and upstartPacific Fusionhas been pledged $900 million in its Series A alone. Part of General Fusion’s challenge is that it’s taking a different approach than many of its competitors. Most fusion startups follow one of two paths: magnetic confinement or inertial confinement. The former uses magnetic fields to control plasma, squeezing it until it reaches the conditions for nuclei to fuse. The latter approach typically uses lasers to compress a fuel pellet.

    "title": "Elon Musk took a chainsaw to the US government — Tesla is taking the hit",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Elon Musk has long been credited with turning Tesla into a beacon of innovation, the visionary who pushed the world into an era of electrification. But his slide into politics — specifically his alignment with President Trump and activities within the federal government — has dragged Tesla into uncertainty. For many would-be Tesla buyers, the brand has lost its progressive luster. And while Musk has longbeen the face of Tesla, that link has taken a negative turn as the billionaire oversees mass layoffs and the elimination of federal programs via theDepartment of Government Efficiency. Tesla’s disappointingfirst-quarter earnings, which saw profits drop 71% amid weakened sales and anti-Musk sentiment, demonstrate just how much the brand has fallen out of favor. The companyreported336,681 deliveries in the first three months of 2025, down from 495,570 in Q4 2024 and 386,810 in the first quarter of last year. That’s off the back of anunimpressive 2024, which saw fewer deliveries than the year prior amid production delays and increased EV competition. For many, Musk’s political activities have turned Tesla into a symbolic pariah. Tesla trade-ins have hit record highs, while sales in Europe have dropped. Foreign leaders are calling for boycotts and the automaker’s stock price has lost about half its value since December. All the while,protesters continueto assemble outside Tesla showrooms, dealerships, and even charging stations in an effort to accelerate the automaker’s brand devaluation and with it, they hope, Musk’s wealth. “They have a certain significant public image problem that’s really something we haven’t seen before in this industry,” Sean Tucker, lead editor at Kelley Blue Book, told TechCrunch. Even one of Tesla’s most unwavering bulls, Dan Ives, hasbeggedMusk to focus less on politics and more on his business “or else unfortunately darker times are ahead for Tesla.” And even though Musk said last month that he’d take astep back from DOGE, he’s not giving up on it either.To combat the effect this might have on Tesla, Musk has and likely will continue to lean on his sales pitch that Tesla isn’t an automaker, it’s an AI company, one that will someday commercialize autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots. The question now is whether the Tesla brand can recover. Below are the moments, which TechCrunch will continue to update, that are shaping perception of the Tesla brand and may have a lasting effect on its future. Tesla’s new car sales haveplunged across Europe, even as sales of electric cars made by other brands rose on the continent. In the first four months of 2025, Tesla sales dropped 37.2% in Europe, and in Sweden, they dropped 81% year-over-year. Germany, traditionally one of Tesla’s largest markets and home to one of its gigafactories, has turned against Musk in a big way. A recent survey of 100,000 Germans found94% would never purchase a Tesla, and sales data backs that up. In March 2025, Tesla’s Germany sales weredown 42.5%. A slight increase from the 75% sales slump in February. The Wall Street Journal reported in May that Tesla’s board began searching forMusk’s potential successorsometime around early April as Musk waded further into Washington to slash government spending. When the report came out, Tesla chair Robyn Denholm declared the WSJ’s reporting to be “absolutely false.” Either way, the report does raise questions about succession planning if Musk-associated brand devaluation continues. Musk said during Tesla’s first-quarter earnings call that he would take a step back from DOGE, but, importantly, he also said he’d continue working for the agency for theremainder of Trump’s presidency. “Tesla Takedown” protests have been spreading around the world with the goal of encouraging people to stop buying Teslas and to sell their Tesla stock, which protesters say will hurt Musk where he holds most of his power — in his wallet (more on those below). As of the first quarter of this year, those protests have officially become anofficial riskin Tesla’s regulatory filings. The new risk factor in Tesla’s latest SEC filings warns that certain criticism “has incited protests, some escalating to violence targeting our operations, products and personnel.” Tesla’s lawyers also expanded what’s at risk, saying negative perceptions resulting from the protests, along with the broader criticism of the company, “may harm our brand and our business (including sales) and make it more difficult to raise additional funds if needed.” While Tesla is the automakerbest positionedto parry the blow of Trump’s automotive tariffs in the U.S., the company is stillexposeddue to Musk’s alliance with the president. In April, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives cut Tesla’s price target to $315, down from $550, once again citing Musk’s politics creating a brand crisis for the automaker. He also noted that Musk’s association with Trump, and therefore his tariff policies, are not only affecting sales in the U.S. and Europe, but also threatening Tesla’s popularity in China, “further driv[ing] Chinese consumers to buy domestic such as BYD.” While recent studies found that Musk’s political leanings have lost him customers in what has historically been Tesla’s base — Democrats — the shift has garnered him street cred with Republicans.One studyfrom researchers at Northeastern University, Columbia University, and the University of Iowa found that Republicans’ likelihood to purchase a Tesla moved up from 7% before Musk’s Trump endorsement to 10.2% after. That sentiment might only increase amid Trump’s reciprocal endorsement of Musk and Tesla, including hisfree commercialat the White House on March 11. At an impromptu, glitchy, livestreamed Tesla all-hands presentation on the evening of March 20, Musk told his employees and investors to “hang on to [their] stock” despite it feeling “like Armageddon.” “It’s very difficult for people in the stock market, especially those that look in the rearview mirror, which is most people, to imagine a future where suddenly a 10 million vehicle fleet has five to 10 times the usefulness,” Musk said, referring to thenow-defunct claimthat all existing Teslas have the hardware necessary to turn into fully self-driving cars with a mere software update. He advised employees to tune out the noise and focus on building the Cybercab, which would be the new priority. The Cybercab is a two-seater robotaxi with no steering wheel or pedals. Current federal regulations don’t allow for the mass production of such vehicles because they don’t have human controls, but Musk has signaled an intent to amend those rules. He noted that the Cybercab manufacturing process would be a feat of engineering, a “high-speed consumer electronics line” that “will move so fast that … it’ll be able to produce a car, ultimately, in less than five seconds.” During the call, Musk also promised to produce about 5,000 Optimus robots this year, which he believes will be Tesla’s most valuable asset. On the same day as the sudden all-hands, Tesla bullDan Ives wrotein a note that Musk’s involvement in DOGE has led to a “brand tornado crisis moment for Musk and Tesla.” “If you agree or disagree with DOGE it misses the point that by Musk spending 110% of his time with DOGE (and not as Tesla CEO) since President Trump got back into the White House this has essentially turned Tesla into a political symbol … and this is a bad thing,” Ives wrote. Tesla showrooms, charging stations, facilities, and even privately owned vehicles have been hit with attacks. In some cases, the damage is minimal — some spray paint and a keyed car. In others, violence has ensued. Dealerships have been hit with bullets and Molotov cocktails, and charging stations have been set on fire. Musk has responded byquestioningwhy anyone would want to hurt Tesla. Trump’s response has been more pointed. He has declared that any acts of violence — which could include spray-painting — would be treated by the federal government asdomestic terrorism. “I look forward to watching the sick terrorist thugs get 20-year jail sentences for what they are doing to Elon Musk and Tesla. Perhaps they could serve them in the prisons of El Salvador, which have become so recently famous for such lovely conditions!” Trump said on his social media platform, Truth Social. As of the time of this writing, the Department of Justice hasbrought charges against three individualswho are allegedly responsible for violent destruction of Tesla properties. Peaceful protests have also erupted across the country as part of theTesla Takedownmovement. Protesters have been showing up at Tesla dealerships and showrooms to try to discourage people from buying Tesla cars. They also aim to encourage Tesla owners to trade in their vehicles and Tesla stockholders to sell their shares. Despite these protests being peaceful, we’re beginning to see the start of violent counterprotests — like the Florida man whodrove his SUV into a crowdof protestors outside a Palm Beach Tesla dealership in March. Thousands of people joined in Tesla Takedown protests the last weekend in March at showrooms across the country. The crowds drew small numbers of counterprotests in some regions that were peopled mainly by MAGA supporters,Wired reports. Among them were far-right extremists, including members of the Proud Boys and armed militias. While speaking at a rally celebrating Trump’s inauguration in January, Musk did what many have perceived to be not one, but two,Nazi salutes. The damage has only been amplified by Musk’s vocal support for the far-right German political party AfD, as well as his history ofsharing antisemitic posts. Shortly after the salute incident, activistsprojected an imageof Musk doing the salute, along with the word “Heil,” onto Tesla’s Berlin gigafactory. One of Tesla’s biggest competitors, China’s BYD, has been touting significant breakthroughs in charging. The automaker said this week that its new cars can becharged in five minutes,which would give it a huge competitive edge over Tesla and indeed any other EV maker. China is one of Tesla’s largest markets, but BYD is continuing to bully the automaker on its home turf. BYD recentlyunveiled its “God’s Eye”advanced driver-assistance system — akin to Tesla’s Autopilot and FSD — that will be installed at no additional cost on its entire EV lineup, including its ultra-cheap $9,600 Seagull hatchback. BYD continues to impress consumers with its high-tech range of EVs and hybrids and has once againsurpassed Tesla on revenue. In 2024, BYD reported $107 billion in revenue compared to Tesla’s $97.7 billion. Tesla has languished with an aging lineup for years. The Cybertruck was meant to be the automaker’s next big bet that would prove it’s still capable of delivering innovative new models. And indeed, the truck has been popular among American buyers. Still, Tesla has issued eight recalls on the Cybertruck since launching the vehicle in November 2023. Most recently, Tesla had torecall 46,000 Cybertrucksbecause of an exterior steel trim panel on the side of the windshield that looks like it was stuck on with superglue and can just peel off.

TeleMessage came into the spotlightlast weekafter it was reported that former U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz was using TeleMessage’s modified version of Signal. Israel-based TeleMessage, owned by Smarsh, offers its clients a way to archive messages, including voice notes, from encrypted apps. The messages of cabinet members and Waltz were not compromised, 404 Media said, but the hacked data contained contents of messages; contact information of government officials; back-end login credentials for TeleMessage; and more. Data pertaining to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, crypto exchange Coinbase, and financial service providers like Scotiabank were extracted by the hacker, the report said. The hack revealed that the archived chat logs are not end-to-end encrypted between the modded version of Signal that TeleMessage offers and the ultimate location where it stores the messages, 404 Media reported. Smarsh, the company that owns TeleMessage, told TechCrunch in a statement that it suspended TeleMessage’s services, and is investigating “a potential security incident.” “Upon detection, we acted quickly to contain it and engaged an external cybersecurity firm to support our investigation,” read the statement. “Out of an abundance of caution, all TeleMessage services have been temporarily suspended. All other Smarsh products and services remain fully operational.” A Coinbase spokesperson said tha the company is “closely following these reports and assessing their impact on Coinbase.  At this time, there is no evidence any sensitive Coinbase customer information was accessed or that any customer accounts are at risk, since Coinbase does not use this tool to share passwords, seed phrases, or other data needed to access accounts.” Signal, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and Scotiabank did not immediately return requests for comment.

The tier is being piloted in India, France, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. The news was first reported byMoney Control. “We’re experimenting with new ways to provide greater flexibility and value to our YouTube Premium subscribers, including offering a two-person Premium plan option in some countries, allowing two people to share a subscription at a reduced cost,” a YouTube spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch. Similar to Spotify’s Duo subscription tier, YouTube’s new plan allows two people who live together to access Premium for a discounted price. The plan is aimed at people who want the benefits of YouTube Premium, such as ad-free viewing and background play, without committing to a full family plan. As for YouTube, the new plan would allow it to increase its subscriber numbers and potentially earn more revenue. For instance, people who may have canceled their Premium plansafter price hikes in recent yearsmay decide to sign up for the discounted two-person plan. The launch of the test comes as Google-owned YouTube has been working to diversify its subscription offerings. In March, YouTube rolled out a newpremium subscription tier called Premium Litethat lets users watch “most” videos ad-free for $7.99 per month. The plan is currently available in the United States, Australia, Germany, and Thailand. At the time, the company said YouTube Music and YouTube Premium subscriptions combined reach over 125 million users worldwide, including trials. As with any other test launch, it’s unknown when or if YouTube plans to roll out the two-person Premium plan more widely or in additional countries.

Prabhav Jain, 11x’s CTO, has been named the company’s new CEO. Sukkar will move into a “non-executive chairman” position, where he will work with Jain on “strategic direction, product vision, industry relationships, and opening new market opportunities,” Sukkar wrote on LinkedIn, helping 11x in any way he can “into the future.” “I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about what it takes to go from a fast growing startup to an enduring enterprise grade scale-up, and I have realised that I love building from the ground up. It’s in my bones,” Sukkar wrote on LinkedIn. “I love 11x and believe in our mission deeply. We have a massive opportunity ahead. But sometimes, loving your company means knowing when to pass the CEO baton for the next leg of the race.” AsTechCrunch previously reported in March,11x at that time had been showing off on its website customer logos of companies that were not active customers, and one of those companies was threatening to sue over the matter. Other sources also told TechCrunch that the 11x product had issues and the company had struggled with customer retention. Some employees also described the startup as a grueling place to work.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us OpenAI hasdecidedthat its nonprofit division will retain control over its for-profit organization, after the companyinitially announcedthat it planned to convert to a for-profit organization. According to the company, OpenAI’s business wing, which has been under the nonprofit since 2019, will transition to a public benefit corporation (PBC). The nonprofit will control and also be a large shareholder of the PBC. “OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, and is today overseen and controlled by that nonprofit,” OpenAI Board Chairman Bret Taylor wrote in astatementon the company’s blog. “Going forward, it will continue to be overseen and controlled by that nonprofit.” OpenAI says that it made the decision “after hearing from civic leaders and engaging in constructive dialogue with the offices of the Attorney General of Delaware and the Attorney General of California.” “We thank both offices and we look forward to continuing these important conversations to make sure OpenAI can continue to effectively pursue its mission,” Taylor said. OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit in 2015, but it converted to a “capped-profit” in 2019 and was trying to restructure once more into a for-profit. When it transitioned to a capped-profit, OpenAI retained its nonprofit wing, which currently has a controlling stake in the organization’s corporate arm. OpenAI had said that its conversion, which it argued was necessary to raise the capital needed to grow and expand its operations,would preserve its nonprofitstatus and infuse it with additional resources to be spent on “charitable initiatives” in sectors such as healthcare, education, and science. In exchange for its controlling stake in OpenAI’s enterprise, the nonprofitwould reportedly stand to reap billions of dollars. Many disagreed with the proposal, including early OpenAI investor Elon Musk, who filed a lawsuit against OpenAI opposing the company’s planned transition. Musk’s complaint accuses the startup of abandoning its nonprofit mission, which aimed to ensure its AI research benefits all of humanity. Musk had sought a preliminary injunction tohalt OpenAI’s conversion. A federal judgedenied the requestbut permitted the case to go to a jury trial in spring 2026. A group of ex-OpenAI employees and Encode, a nonprofit that co-sponsored California’sill-fated SB 1047AI safety legislation,filed amicus briefsseveral weeks agoin support of Musk’s lawsuit. Separately, a cohort of organizations, including nonprofits and labor groups like the California Teamsters, petitioned California Attorney General Rob Bonta to stop OpenAI from becoming a for-profit, claiming the company had “failed to protect its charitable assets.” Several Nobel laureates, law professors, and civil society organizations had alsosent lettersto Bonta and Delaware’s attorney general, Kathy Jennings, requesting that they halt the startup’s restructuring efforts. The stakes were high for OpenAI, which needed to complete its for-profit conversion by the end of this year or next or risk relinquishing some of the capital the company has raised in recent months,according toreports. It’s unclear what consequences may befall OpenAI now that it’s reversed course. In a letter to staff on Mondayalso publishedon OpenAI’s blog, CEO Sam Altman said he thinks OpenAI may eventually require “trillions of dollars” to fulfill its goal of “[making the company’s] services broadly available to all of humanity.” “[OpenAI’s nonprofit] will become a big shareholder in the PBC in an amount supported by independent financial advisors,” wrote Altman. “[W]e are moving to a normal capital structure where everyone has stock. … We look forward to advancing the details of [our] plan in continued conversation with them, [our partner] Microsoft, and our newly appointed nonprofit commissioners.” Topics AI Editor Get inside access to Europe’s top investment minds — with leaders from Monzo, Accel, Paladin Group, and more — plus top-tier networking at StrictlyVC London.

    "article_text": "This VE Day 80 parade was a celebration that paid its respects, with some poignancy, to the wartime generation. There was an understated warmth that suited the moment. This week's events will be one the last big public moments of recognition for the diminishing number of veterans from World War Two. For Monday's events, veterans had pride of place on a viewing platform at the top of the Mall, sitting alongside the Royal Family and the prime minister, watching the military parade and marching bands. These veterans are now in their late 90s and older, commemorating an event which took place when many were still only teenagers. In today's fragile political climate there is often talk about defending democracy. But these veterans had actually done that and won, and remain now as some of the last representatives of a generation that fought Nazism and all of the intolerance and barbarism that represented. Many of those who had cared for others were now reliant on carers for themselves. It's a different kind of battle. On the viewing platform King Charles was chatting to Joy Trew, a wireless operator in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, who was 18 on VE Day in 1945. This summer she will be 99 years old. She said the King had helped tuck in a blanket to keep her warm on a chilly day. And she had told the King about the other female veterans: \"A lot of the women look formidable and he said 'yes'.\" After the modern RAF paid its own tribute with a thundering flypast, the veterans were slowly wheeled across to Palace, in one last column. They were heading for a tea party held in their honour, with the King and Queen and Prince and Princess of Wales hearing first hand stories that will soon slip into history. Joyce Wilding, aged 100, remembered the celebrations in London on VE Day: \"We went to Piccadilly where there was a stream of people singing and dancing, there were soldiers up lampposts, it was extraordinary. \"We were outside Buckingham Palace and you could hardly move there were so many people cheering and singing.\" In that euphoric moment, the King's mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, then 19, had also secretly gone out among the crowds and had been part of a conga at the Ritz hotel. Among the older guests was Henry Ducker, now aged 104, who was only 19 when he joined the RAF in 1940, working as a flight mechanic. He had spent VE Day in Italy. He said Queen Camilla had been \"quite funny, very humorous\". This 80th anniversary event had drawn big crowds along the Mall. They had given a particularly warm welcome to the Ukrainian contingent in the parade, carrying the blue and yellow flag of their country. It was a sharp reminder of present conflicts as well as those from the past. The King had stood on the viewing platform, saluting the different military formations as they marched past. Was he thinking of his own grandfather, George VI, who had waved from the balcony on the original VE night? Compared with reports of the feverish celebrations in 1945, these were relatively restrained crowds at this commemorative event. They were quietly paying their respects, many perhaps with their own thoughts and memories. As is often the case with modern crowds, many were more interested in taking photos on their phones than cheering. There is also an unmistakable growing distance in time. Prince George was at Buckingham Palace for the tea party for veterans, listening in to the stories. But it's a long way back for his generation, with a 68-year gap between his birth and VE Day. It's the same distance as between his father Prince William's birth and the outbreak of the First World War. There were nostalgic street parties, but when younger generations hear about \"spam\" they'll be thinking about their email rather than the food cupboard. This first big day of VE Day 80 commemorations caught the sense of reflection. The mood in London was good natured and supportive. Even the rain held off until the parade was over. There were neighbourhood gatherings, from local community groups to Downing Street, celebrating the wartime spirit and a sense of togetherness. And such public events might be a chance to privately remember those who had made sacrifices without ever seeking recognition. It's a moment when memories are passed from one generation to the next and stories turn into history.

    "title": "Americans used to be steadfast in their support for Israel. Those days are gone",
    "article_text": "I ran from the White House briefing room, past the portico entrance of the West Wing to our camera position on the lawn, and flung on an ear piece connecting me to the studio. A moment later the presenter asked me about the comments we had just heard live from US President Donald Trump. I said we were seeing a fundamental shift in a United States' policy position after decades of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It was February this year, and Trump had just held talks with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - the first foreign leader since Trump's inauguration to be invited to the White House. The US president vowed that his country would take control of the Gaza Strip, having earlier pledged the territory would also be \"cleaned out\" and emptied of its Palestinian population. Trump was grabbing the world's attention with a proposal that hardened his administration's support for Israel and also upended international norms, flying in the face of international law. It marked an apex of the current Republican Party's relationship with Israel - sometimes described as support \"at all costs\". The alliance between the two countries had been thrust into the international spotlight after the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023 and Israel's offensive in Gaza that followed. During that war, the administration of President Joe Biden sent some $18bn (£13.5bn) worth of weapons to Israel, maintaining unprecedented levels of US backing. The period was marked by intensifying protests in the US, with many of those protesting being traditional Democrat leaning voters. The fallout became the focus of a bitter culture war centring on American attitudes towards Israel and the Palestinians. I covered demonstrations in which protesters repeatedly labelled Biden \"Genocide Joe\" – an accusation he always rejected. At the time Donald Trump branded the protesters \"radical-left lunatics\" and the Trump administration is now targeting for deportation hundreds of foreign students who it accuses of antisemitism or support for Hamas, a move being vigorously challenged in the courts. But as a Democrat who could otherwise have expected the vote of many of those upset over his support for Israel that support was politically costly for Biden in a way not experienced by previous presidents or, indeed, Trump. One of Biden's key decision makers over relations with Israel still wrestles with the decisions they took. \"My first reaction is just, I understand that this has evoked incredibly passionate feelings for Arab Americans, for non-Arab Americans, Jewish Americans,\" says Jake Sullivan, Biden's former national security adviser. \"There were two competing considerations: one was wanting to curb Israel's excesses, both with respect to civilian casualties and the flow of humanitarian assistance. The other was [...] wanting to make sure that we were not cutting Israel off from the capabilities it needed to confront its enemies on multiple different fronts.\" He added: \"The United States stood behind Israel materially, morally, and in every other way in those days following October 7th.\" But opinion polls suggest support for Israel among the American public is dwindling. A Gallup survey taken in March this year found only 46% of Americans expressed support for Israel (the lowest level in 25 years of Gallup's annual tracking) while 33% now said they sympathised with the Palestinians - the highest ever reading of that measure. Other polls have found similar results. Surveys - with all their limitations - suggest the swing is largely among Democrats and the young, although not exclusively. Between 2022 and 2025, the Pew Research Center found that the proportion of Republicans who said they had unfavourable views of Israel rose from 27% to 37%  (younger Republicans, aged under 49, drove most of that change). The US has long been Israel's most powerful ally - ever since May 1948, when America was the first country to recognise the nascent State of Israel. But while US support for Israel is extremely likely to continue long-term, these swings in sentiment raise questions over the practical extent and policy limits of the US's ironclad backing and whether the shifting sands of public opinion will eventually feed through to Washington, with real-world policy impacts. To many, the close relationship between the US and Israel seems like a permanent, unshakeable part of the geopolitical infrastructure. But it wasn't always guaranteed - and at the very beginning largely came down to one man. In early 1948, US President Harry S Truman had to decide on his approach to Palestine. The country was in the grip of sectarian bloodshed between Jews and Arab Palestinians after three decades of colonial rule by Britain, which had announced its intention to pull out. Truman was deeply moved by the plight of Jewish survivors of the Holocaust stranded in displaced persons camps in Europe. In New York City, a young Francine Klagsbrun, who would later become an academic and historian of Israeli prime minister Golda Meir, watched her parents praying for a Jewish homeland. \"I grew up in a very Jewish home and a very Zionist home also,\" she explains. \"So my older brother and I would go out and collect money to try to get England to open the doors. My brother would go on the subway trains, all the doors open on the train and he'd shout 'open, open, open the doors to Palestine',\" she recalls. Truman's administration was deeply divided over whether to back a Jewish state. The CIA and the Department of State cautioned against recognising a Jewish state. They feared a bloody conflict with Arab countries that might draw in the US, risking Cold War escalation with the Soviets. Two days before Britain was due to pull out of Palestine, an explosive row took place in the Oval Office. Truman's domestic advisor Clark Clifford argued in favour of recognising a Jewish state. On the other side of the debate was Secretary of State George Marshall, a World War Two general whom Truman viewed as \"the greatest living American\". The man Truman admired so much was vigorously opposed to the president immediately recognising a Jewish state because of his fears about a regional war - and even went as far as telling Truman he would not vote for him in the coming presidential election if he backed recognition. But despite the moment of extraordinary tension, Truman immediately recognised the State of Israel when it was declared two days later by David Ben-Gurion, the country's first prime minister. The historian Rashid Khalidi, a New York-born Palestinian whose family members were expelled from Jerusalem by the British in the 1930s, says the US and Israel were fused together in part by shared cultural connections. From 1948 onwards, he says, the Palestinians had a critical diplomatic disadvantage in the US, with their claim to national self-determination sidelined in an unequal contest. \"On the one side, you had the Zionist movement led by people whom are European and American by origin… The Arabs had nothing similar,\" he says. \"[The Arabs] weren't familiar with the societies, the cultures, the political leaderships of the countries that decided the fate of Palestine. How could you speak to American public opinion if you had no idea what America is like?\" says Khalidi. Popular culture played its role too - notably the 1958 novel and subsequent blockbuster film Exodus by the author Leon Uris. It retold the story of Israel's establishment to mass audiences of the 1960s, the movie version creating a heavily Americanised portrayal of pioneers in a new land. Ehud Olmert, who at the time was a political activist but would later become Israeli prime minister, points to the war of 1967 as the moment when America's support for Israel became the profound alliance that it is today. That was the war in which Israel, after weeks of escalating fears of invasion by its neighbours, defeated the Arab countries in six days, effectively tripling the size of its territory, and launching its military occupation over (at that time) more than a million stateless Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. \"For the first time, the United States understood the importance and the significance of Israel as a major military and political power in the Middle East, and since then everything has changed in the basic relations within our two countries,\" he says. Over the years, Israel became the biggest recipient of US foreign military aid on Earth. Strong American diplomatic support, particularly at the United Nations, has been a key element of the alliance; while successive US presidents have also sought to broker peace between Israel and its Arab neighbours. But in recent years it has been far from a straightforward relationship. When I spoke to Jake Sullivan, I put to him the issue of Arab Americans in the state of Michigan who boycotted Biden and his successor candidate Kamala Harris over the extent of their support for Israel during the Gaza conflict, voting instead for Trump. He rejected the idea that Biden lost the state because of this support. But that backing still prompted a marked backlash within a section of the American public. A Pew Research Center survey taken in March this year found that 53% of Americans expressed an unfavourable opinion of Israel, an 11 point increase since the last time the survey was taken in 2022. Currently, these shifts in public opinion haven't yet prompted a major change in US foreign policy. Whilst some ordinary US voters are turning away from Israel, on Capitol Hill elected politicians from both parties are still mostly keen to talk up the importance of a strong alliance with Israel. Some think that a sustained, long-term shift in public opinion might eventually lead to reduced real-world support for the country - with weaker diplomatic ties and reduced military aid. This issue is felt particularly sharply by some inside Israel. Several months before 7 October, the former Israeli general and head of the Military Intelligence Directorate, Tamir Hayman, warned of cracks forming between his country and the United States, in part because of what he described as the slow movement of American Jews away from Zionism. Israel's political shift in favour of the national-religious right has played a key part in this. From early 2023, Israel was gripped by an unprecedented wave of protests among Jewish Israelis against Netanyahu's judicial reforms, with many arguing he was moving the country towards theocracy – a claim he always rejected. Some in the US who had always felt a deep sense of connection with Israel were watching with growing concern. In March this year, the Institute for National Security Studies, a leading Tel Aviv-based think tank led by Hayman, published a paper arguing that US public opinion had entered the \"danger zone\", as far as support for Israel was concerned. \"The dangers of diminished US support, particularly as it reflects long-term and deeply rooted trends, cannot be overstated,\" wrote the paper's author, Theodore Sasson. \"Israel needs the support of the global superpower for the foreseeable future,\". That support at the policy level has only strengthened over the decades, but it is important to note that historic American opinion polling shows public opinion has ebbed and flowed before. Today, Dennis Ross, who helped negotiate the Oslo accords with President Bill Clinton, says American opinion on Israel has become increasingly tied to sharp political divisions in the US. \"Trump is viewed very negatively by most Democrats - the latest polls show over 90 percent,\" Ross says. \"There's potential for Trumpian support for Israel to feed a dynamic here that, at least among Democrats, increases criticism of Israel.\" But he expects that Washington's support for Israel - in the form of military aid and diplomatic ties - will continue. And he thinks if Israeli voters eject their prime minister and replace him with a more centrist government, one that may reverse some of the disquiet in the US. A general election must be held in Israel before late October next year. Under such a new Israeli government, Ross argues, \"there won't be the same impulse towards creating de-facto annexation of the West Bank. There'll be much more outreach to the Democratic Party and the Democratic Party officials.\" Those who see a fraying relationship are paying particularly close attention to the views of younger Americans - a group that has shown the most marked shift in opinion since 7 October. As the 'TikTok generation', many young Americans get their news about the war from social media and the high civilian death toll from Israel's offensive in Gaza appears to have driven the declining support among young Democrats and liberals in America. Last year, 33 percent of Americans under 30 said their sympathies lie entirely or mostly with the Palestinian people, versus 14 percent who said the same about Israelis, according to a Pew Research poll published last month. Older Americans were more likely to sympathise with the Israelis. Karin Von Hippel, chair of the Arden Defence and Security Practice and a former official in the US State Department, agrees there is a demographic divide among Americans on the topic of Israel - one that even extends to Congress. \"Younger Congress men and women are less knee jerk, reactively supporting Israel,\" she says. \"And I think younger Americans, including Jewish Americans, are less supportive of Israel than their parents were.\" But she is sceptical of the idea that this might lead to a serious change at the policy level. Despite changing opinions among the party's base, she says, many of the most prominent Democrats who might run for President in 2028 are \"classically supportive of Israel\". She names Gretchen Whitmer, the governor of Michigan, and Pete Buttigieg, the former Transportation Secretary, as examples. And what about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Instagram-famous congresswoman who is a long-standing supporter of Palestinian rights? Hippel responds bluntly: \"I don't think an Ocasio-Cortez type can win right now.\" In the weeks after February's Trump-Netanyahu press conference at the White House, I asked Jake Sullivan where he thought the US-Israel relationship was going. He argued that both countries were dealing with internal threats to their democratic institutions that would define their character and their relationship. \"I think it's almost less of a foreign policy question than it is a domestic policy question in these two countries - whither America and whither Israel?\" he says. \"The answer to those two questions will tell you where does the US-Israel relationship go five, ten, fifteen years from now.\" BBC InDepthis the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "title": "Israel security cabinet approves plan to 'capture' Gaza, official says",
    "article_text": "Israel's security cabinet has approved a plan to expand its military offensive against Hamas which includes the \"capture\" of Gaza and the holding of its territory, according to an Israeli official. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the cabinet had decided on a \"forceful operation\" to destroy Hamas and rescue its remaining hostages, and that Gaza's 2.1 million population \"will be moved, to protect it\". He did not say how much territory would be seized by troops, but he stressed that \"they will not enter and come out\". The cabinet also approved, in principle, a plan to deliver aid through private companies, which would end a two-month blockade the UN says has caused severe food shortages. The UN and other aid agencies have said the proposal would be a breach of basic humanitarian principles and that they will not co-operate. A Hamas official said the group rejected Israel's \"pressure and blackmail\". Asked about the Israeli plan to expand its offensive, President Donald Trump repeated a pledge to help get food to Palestinians there. The UK meanwhile said it \"does not support an expansion of Israel's military operations in Gaza\". The EU earlier urged restraint, saying it was concerned about \"further casualties and suffering for the Palestinian population\". Israel's security cabinet met on Sunday evening to discuss the Gaza offensive, which resumed when Israel ended a two-month ceasefire on 18 March. An Israeli official who briefed the media on Monday morning said ministers voted unanimously to approve a plan proposed by the Israeli military's Chief of Staff Lt Gen Eyal Zamir to \"defeat Hamas in Gaza and return the hostages\". \"The plan will include, among other things, the capture of the Strip and holding the territories, moving the Gazan population south for its defence, denying Hamas the ability to distribute humanitarian supplies, and powerful attacks against Hamas,\" the official said. Israeli media reported that first stage would include the seizure of additional areas of Gaza and the expansion of the Israeli-designated \"buffer zone\" running along the territory's borders. It would aim to give Israel additional leverage in negotiations with Hamas on a new ceasefire and hostage release deal. Later, a senior Israeli security official said the plan would not be implemented until after US President Donald Trump's visit to the region between 13 and 16 May, providing what he called \"a window of opportunity\" to Hamas to agree a new ceasefire and hostage release deal. Trump will visit Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar on his trip. Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich meanwhile told a conference in Jerusalem on Monday that Israel was \"going to finally occupy the Gaza Strip\", according to Reuters news agency. Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 Middle East war along with the West Bank. It unilaterally withdrew troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005, but the UN still regards Gaza as Israeli-occupied territory because it retained control of Gaza's shared border, airspace and shoreline. In a briefing later on Monday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the expanded campaign would displace most Palestinians in Gaza as air strikes and other military operations continued. However, critics say military action has failed to secure the return of the 59 remaining hostages - up to 24 of whom are believed to be alive - and have urged the government to strike a deal with Hamas. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents hostages' relatives, said the plan was an admission by the government that it was \"choosing territories over the hostages\" and that this was \"against the will of over 70% of the people\" in Israel. Hamas official Mahmoud Mardawi reiterated that the group wanted a comprehensive deal, including \"a complete ceasefire, full withdrawal from Gaza, reconstruction of the Gaza Strip, and the release of all prisoners from both sides\". Palestinians in north Gaza told the BBC that they were strongly opposed to being forcibly displaced to the south once again, with several saying they would rather die amid the ruins of their homes. \"In October 2023, I evacuated with my children, daughters, and grandchildren - about 60 people in total,\" 76-year-old Gaza City resident Ahmed Shehata said. \"We lived through unbearable conditions in what Israel claimed was a 'safe zone' in the south. This time, we will not leave, even if Israel brings down the tents over our heads.\" Osama Tawfiq, a 48-year-old father of five, said: \"Israeli threats won't scare us. We are staying in Gaza.\" The Israeli official said the security cabinet also approved by a large majority \"the possibility of humanitarian [aid] distribution - if necessary - that would prevent Hamas from taking control of supplies and would destroy its governmental capabilities\". The security official said deliveries would resume once the expanded offensive began, and that the military would establish a \"sterile area\" in the southern Rafah area that Palestinians would be able to enter pending inspection. On Sunday, the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT), a forum that includes UN agencies, said Israeli officials were seeking to \"shut down the existing aid distribution system\" and \"have us agree to deliver supplies through Israeli hubs under conditions set by the Israeli military, once the government agrees to re-open crossings\". The HCT warned that the plan would mean large parts of Gaza, including less mobile and most vulnerable people, would continue to go without supplies. \"It contravenes fundamental humanitarian principles and appears designed to reinforce control over life-sustaining items as a pressure tactic – as part of a military strategy,\" it said. \"It is dangerous, driving civilians into militarized zones to collect rations, threatening lives, including those of humanitarian workers, while further entrenching forced displacement.\" Israel cut off all deliveries of humanitarian aid and other supplies to Gaza aid on 2 March, two weeks before resuming its offensive. According to the UN, the population is facing a renewed risk of hunger and malnutrition because warehouses are empty, bakeries have shut, and community kitchens are days away from running out of supplies. The blockade has also cut off essential medicines, vaccines and medical equipment needed by Gaza's overwhelmed healthcare system. The UN says Israel is obliged under international law to ensure supplies for Gaza's population, almost all of whom have been displaced. Israel says it is complying with international law and there is no shortage of aid. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 52,567 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 2,459 since the Israeli offensive resumed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. A spokesman for the Houthi-run health ministry said at least 21 people were injured in the attack. Footage appeared to show a plume of black smoke rising from an area near the airport on the outskirts of Tel Aviv. Jumaa Zawayda didn't know if his home was among those destroyed after Israel ordered thousands to evacuate Jenin. Israel's PM says it will \"not allow any threat\" to the minority in Syria after sectarian clashes in which dozens were killed. The incident happened off the coast of Malta. The government said a fire onboard the ship was \"brought under control overnight\".",

    "title": "Attenborough at 99 delivers 'greatest message he's ever told'",
    "article_text": "Sir David Attenborough is launching what he says is one of the most important films of his career as he enters his hundredth year. He believes his new, cinema-length film Ocean could play a decisive role in saving biodiversity and protecting the planet from climate change. Sir David, who will be 99 on Thursday, says: \"After almost 100 years on the planet, I now understand the most important place on land is not on Earth but at sea.\" The ocean is the planet's support system and humanity's greatest ally against climate catastrophe, the film argues. It shows how the world's oceans are at a crossroads. A blue carpet will be rolled out at the film's premiere tonight at the Royal Festival Hall. A host of celebrities are expected to attend including Chris Martin and Coldplay, Benedict Cumberbatch, astronaut Tim Peake, Geri Halliwell-Horner and Simon LeBon. Toby Nowlan, who produced Ocean, says this new production is not a typical Attenborough film. \"This is not about seeing brand new natural history behaviours.  It is the greatest message he's ever told,\" he says. The film documents how the state of the world's oceans and our understanding of how they function have changed in the course of Sir David's lifetime. Sir David remembers his first scuba dive on the Great Barrier Reef way back in 1957:  \"I was so taken aback by the spectacle before me I forgot – momentarily – to breathe.\" Since then, there has been a catastrophic decline in life in the world's oceans.  \"We are almost out of time,\" he warns. Ocean contains some of the most graphic footage of the damage that bottom trawling – a common fishing practice around the world - can do to the seabed. It is a vivid example of how industrial fishing can drain the life from the world's oceans, Sir David claims. The new footage shows how the chain that the trawlers drag behind them scours the seafloor, forcing the creatures it disturbs into the net behind. The trawlers are often after a single species: more than three-quarters of what they catch may be discarded. \"It's hard to imagine a more wasteful way to catch fish,\" comments Sir David. The process also releases vast amounts of carbon dioxide which contributes to the warming of our planet, yet bottom trawling is not just legal but is actively encouraged by many governments. Sir David says the state of the ocean has almost made him lose hope for the future of life on the planet. What has kept him from despair is what he calls the \"most remarkable discovery of all\" – that the ocean can \"recover faster than we had ever imagined\". Sir David says the story of the world's whales has been a source of huge optimism for him. It is estimated that 2.9 million whales were killed by the whaling industry in the 20th Century alone. Scientists have said it is the largest cull of any animal in history when measured in terms of total biomass. It pushed almost all whale species to the edge of extinction. Just one per cent of Blue Whales were left, recalls Sir David: \"I remember thinking that was it. There was no coming back, we had lost the great whales.\" But in 1986 lawmakers bowed to public pressure and banned commercial whaling worldwide. The whale population has rapidly recovered since then. One of the film's directors, Keith Scholey, has worked with Sir David for 44 years.  \"When I first met David, I was in shorts,\" he jokes. That was in 1981, two years after Sir David had resigned as the BBC's director of programmes – one of the most senior jobs at the Corporation. \"He'd done one career, and he was off on his next.\" Despite now nearing his 99th birthday Sir David is still remarkably energetic, says Scholey. \"Every time you work with David, you learn something new,\" he says.  \"It's really good fun. But also, David keeps you on your mettle, because he is so on his mettle and so, you know, it's always a very creative process.\" Sir David's key message in the Ocean film is that all is not lost.  Countries have promised to protect a third of the world's oceans.  He hopes his new film will spur leaders to take firm action on this promise at a UN conference next month. He believes that could be transformational. \"The ocean can bounce back to life,\" Sir David says. \"If left alone it may not just recover but thrive beyond anything anyone alive has ever seen.\" A healthier ocean ecosystem would also be able to trap more carbon dioxide, helping protect the world from climate change, according to scientists. \"In front of us is a chance to protect our climate, our food, our home,\" Sir David says. As he celebrates his 99th birthday this week he is still fighting to protect the natural world he has worked his lifetime to show to us in all its glory. Ocean will be in cinemas across the country from Thursday. Sign up for our Future Earth newsletterto keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

    "article_text": "Englishman Owen Jenner and Shane Richardson, of New Zealand, died in the crash at Oulton Park, Cheshire Two riders have died after an 11-bike crash during the British Supersport Championship race at Oulton Park on Monday. Owen Jenner, 21, and Shane Richardson, 29, were fatally injured in a \"major chain reaction\" incident on the first lap of the race as the riders exited turn one. The race, the third of the weekend, was halted on the first lap, with series director Stuart Higgs later calling the incident \"severe and catastrophic\" as he announced the event was cancelled. In a statement on Monday night, Motorsport Vision Racing (MSVR), who are responsible for circuit operations at Oulton Park, said another rider, Tom Tunstall, 47, had sustained \"significant injuries\". New Zealander Richardson was racing for the Astro-JJR Hippo Suzuki team, while British rider Jenner raced for Rapid Honda. \"Owen Jenner, 21, was initially treated trackside and then taken to the circuit medical centre, where despite further resuscitation treatment he died from a catastrophic head injury,\" MSVR said. \"Shane Richardson, 29, was initially treated trackside and then taken to the circuit medical centre before being transferred to Royal Stoke University Hospital with severe chest injuries. He died prior to arrival. \"Tom Tunstall, 47, was initially treated on the track and was taken to the circuit medical centre. He was later transferred to Royal Stoke University Hospital with significant back and abdominal injuries.\" MSVR and the Motorcycle Racing Control Board added they are \"investigating the full circumstances of the incident in conjunction with the Coroner and Cheshire Constabulary\". Riders Carl Harris, Max Morgan, Cameron Hall, Freddie Barnes and Morgan McLaren-Wood were treated for minor injuries at the circuit medical centre. Lewis Jones, Corey Tinker and George Edwards were also involved in the accident but did not suffer injury.

    "article_text": "A wild beaver has been filmed on a river in Wales in what has been described as a \"hugely significant\" sighting. Beavers disappeared from Britain about 400 years ago after being hunted to extinction, but in the past two decades they have been making a comeback. Naturalist and presenter Iolo Williams, who encountered the wild beaver on the River Dyfi near Machynlleth, said the clear and prolonged sighting was one of the \"very, very best\" things he had ever witnessed. There are four managed enclosures that house beavers in Wales, and an unknown number living in the wild. \"I've seen some incredible wildlife in Wales, some amazing things, but this ranks up there, not just with the best, but as the very, very best,\" said Williams, who captured the moment as part of his BBC seriesIolo's River Valleys. \"The last people to see wild beaver in Wales would have been the Welsh princes, who would have hunted them. \"So they've been absent for hundreds of years. So it's hugely significant.\" In Wales, it is an offence to release beavers into open rivers without a licence, and Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said no licences of this type had been issued. In England, where the governmentrecently approved beavers' reintroductionto the wild, it is thought that there are about 500 of them living - some in the wild and others in enclosures. In Scotland, which began reintroducing beavers to the wild several years ago, it is thought that thereare now more than 1,500. \"We had information that a beaver had been seen on this section of the River Dyfi, and we were told to get to this particular site at 18:00 and the beaver will be there,\" said Williams. \"We had gone out a few days before, and it poured with rain and we'd seen nothing. \"And I must admit, I was thinking, we're not going to get it. \"But then when we went on the first dry day, 18:00, and the beaver was there.\" Williams said the beaver \"didn't pay us any attention at all\". \"It was very chill,\" he added. \"We were on the opposite bank, and we thought we better be quiet, don't move around. And the beaver just saw us and it just carried on feeding and swam.\" Local people have reported seeing the beaver, and others, on the same stretch of the River Dyfi multiple times in recent years. But exactly where they have come from remains a mystery, after a nearby beaver enclosure ruled out any escapes. Alicia Leow-Dyke, from Wildlife Trust Wales, said there was evidence of the semi-aquatic animals breeding along the waterway. \"On this occasion we know it's one family. It could be two families - one family split into two,\" she said. \"There has been evidence of breeding on the river. Youngsters have been spotted on the river over the years. \"Beavers only breed once a year and their litters are pretty small - two to three within a litter. So a beaver family could be anything from two adults, to five or eight if you include the young.\" Last year the Welsh government said it wasconsidering introducing legislation to protect beavers, as wildlife charities called for them to be released into Wales' rivers. Dr Robert Needham, from the Beaver Trust, said their reintroduction could bring substantial benefits, describing them as \"ecosystem engineer[s]\". \"What this means is that the sort of habitat modification that beavers can do through damming, building lodges, digging canals - this can create habitats for other species, and they can increase biodiversity,\" said Dr Needham. \"They can help restore our wetland habitats, which are massively lost throughout Europe, let alone Great Britain. \"They can help alleviate flooding with the dams that they create, particularly in headwater streams, they hold that water back, releasing it slowly. So we see a reduction in peak flow events, during storm events. But this can be really beneficial to villages and society also during during the summer periods, during drought conditions.\" But not everyone believes that reintroducing beavers to the wild is a good thing. Critics say their dams can flood and waterlog fields while the animals themselves can feed on certain agricultural crops and damage trees. \"Fundamentally, there are issues. There are cases where river banks will fall in and the impact of flooding, particularly on on good farmland as well,\" said Aled Jones, president of NFU Cymru. \"The management [of beavers] is crucial. We can't allow an indiscriminate approach where farming businesses are severely impacted. \"So we have to have control measures because this is their livelihoods. And we have to remember this is where farmers make their living, and anything negatively impacting that, if they're losing their crops because of flooding, who pays?\" Iolo's River Valleys will be broadcast on BBC Two and BBC One Wales on 6 May at 19:00 and will also be available on BBC iPlayer.

    "title": "Red Arrows, royals and a packed Mall - the celebrations in pictures",
    "article_text": "Four days of events to commemorate 80 years since Victory in Europe Day began with a military procession through London in front of huge crowds, followed by a dramatic RAF flypast over Buckingham Palace. Proud veterans joined politicians and three generations of royals for the day's poignant and ceremonius events. Meanwhile, people around the country came together to celebrate the bank holiday with commemorative street parties. Below is a selection of some of the best photos from throughout the day. The Red Arrows' trademark red, blue and white smoke added a much needed pop of colour to London's moody grey skies as part of the spectacular aerial tribute organised by the Ministry of Defence. The flypast also included military aircraft from RAF bases all around the UK, delighting spectators and gripping young royals on the balcony of Buckingham Palace. Earlier, a military procession including regiments of the Household Division and Kings Troop Royal Horse Artillery paraded down the Mall from Parliament Square to Buckingham Palace. King Charles saluted as the procession arrived at the Palace having made its way up the Union Jack-lined Mall. He was joined by other royals as well as veterans, politicians and members of the public, who welcomed the military groups as they drew nearer the Palace. Three generations of royals were on show, including the King, Queen and the Prince and Princess of Wales and their family. Political figures in attendance included London's Mayor Sadiq Khan and Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his wife, Lady Starmer. The procession began its journey outside Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament as the clock tower's famous bells rang out. Meanwhile, actor Timothy Spall stood in front of Winston Churchill's statue in Parliament Square to recite part of the former wartime prime minister's original VE Day broadcast. Outside of the high profile benches in front of Buckingham Palace, members of the public lined the Mall to watch the procession and take in the atmosphere. A group of Ukrainian soldiers also joined the march, solemnly parading a Ukrainian flag and wearing military uniform. Once the pageantry and pomp of the ceremony, procession and flyover had ended, attention turned towards tea, cake and partying to celebrate the day. The royals hosted guests inside Buckingham Palace, while the prime minister threw a tea party on Downing Street. Bank holiday street parties were also held around the country including in Manchester, Middlesbrough and Seaford. Away from the main drag of the Mall and Buckingham Palace, the Tower of London displayed almost 30,000 ceramic poppies for the opening of an exhibition titled The Tower Remembers, created by designer Tom Piper. They were originally displayed as part of artist Paul Cummins's Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red installation at the Tower in 2014. The commemorative display resembles a 'wound' at the heart of the Tower, which was bombed during the Blitz. The exhibition will run until Armistice Day on 11 November.

    "title": "VE Day moments so far - and what's still to come",
    "article_text": "VE Day marked the end of World War Two in Europe. Huge crowds took to the streets on 8 May 1945 to sing, dance and rejoice after nearly six years of war. To mark the 80th anniversary, four days of commemorative events have been planned across the UK, from 5 to 8 May. Here's a guide to what's happening and when. On Monday, more than 1,300 armed forces and members of the public took part in a military procession from Whitehall to Buckingham Palace. The event began in Parliament Square with actor Timothy Spall reciting extracts from Prime Minister Winston Churchill's famous VE Day speech. Spall played the wartime leader in the the 2010 film, The King's Speech. The procession travelled down Whitehall, past the Cenotaph, through Admiralty Arch and up the Mall. World War Two veterans watched the event from the end of the Mall at the Queen Victoria Memorial, alongside the King, Queen and Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The procession was followed by a flypast of current and historic military aircraft. It was led by one of two operational Lancaster bombers as well as 23 other aircraft including some of the most advanced combat aircraft. It also featured the Royal Air Force's Red Arrows, famous for their red, white and blue smoke trails in the sky. Three generations of the Royal Family delighted crowds with their appearance at Monday's military parade. King Charles, wearing his naval uniform, and Queen Camilla were in the front row at the Queen Victoria Memorial during the procession. Prince William, Catherine, Princess of Wales, and their three children were also on the viewing platform watching the parade come up the Mall. Afterwards, the royals went to the Buckingham Palace balcony to greet the crowds gathered on the Mall and watch the military flypast. There were three cheers for the Royal Family - and for the VE Day heroes. The Royal Family also hosted a tea party for war veterans, their families and other members of the wartime generation in the palace gardens. The 2025 VE Day commemorations will be the first to take place without any of the royals who appeared on the balcony 80 years ago. In 1945, large crowds gathered outside Buckingham Palace to catch a glimpse of King George VI, the Queen Mother, a young Queen Elizabeth II, and Princess Margaret. London's Cenotaph became a focal point for quiet reflection as commemorations got under way on Bank Holiday Monday. The monument was draped in Union Jack flags, echoing its 1920 unveiling in honour of the fallen soldiers of World War One. Throughout the four days of remembrance, it will serve as a place of silent tribute to those who died in World War Two, both at home and abroad. On Monday, HMS Belfast hosted a private VE Day 80 anniversary event, withRadio 5 Live's Matt Chorleyjoining for afternoon tea. Alate night extravaganzawith drinks, music and special guests then got under way. The famous ship, now parked next to Tower Bridge, is the most significant surviving WW2 warship. It fired some of the opening shots on D-Day in 1944 and protected Arctic convoys during the war. Street parties have also taken place up and down the country, with local communities encouraged to organise their own get-togethers to echo the celebrations from 80 years ago. Councils hosted events and some waived their usual road closure fee. Check your local council website to see what festivities are taking place in your area. And pubs in England and Wales will stay open late on Thursday to allow customers to raise a glass in their local until 01:00 BST. On Tuesday, the Tower of London will open an art installation of 30,000 ceramic poppies. The flowers originally featured inBlood Swept Lands and Seas of Red, an artwork created to mark the centenary of WW1 and included 888,246 poppies at the castle. Royal Historic Palaces (RHP) said the poppies \"will pour across the lawn overlooked by the ancient White Tower, where the blood-red flowers will form a crater, with ripples flowing outwards\". Visitors can see the new installation as part of a general admission ticket to the Tower of London, although a small part will be visible from the public footpath. The exhibition runs until Armistice Day on 11 November. On Wednesday, the Parliament Choir will hostan anniversary concert at the Palace of Westminstermarking the moment when a newsflash announced 8 May 1945 as VE Day. On the same day, the IWM North war museum in Manchester is hostingLetters to Loved Ones,a performance about personal stories of the conflict and people's understanding of the war today. On Thursday commemorations will be marked by a thanksgiving service at Westminster Abbey andVE Day 80: A Celebration to Remember, an evening concert at Horse Guards Parade. Expected to draw over 10,000 attendees, the concert will feature stars such as Samantha Barks, Fleur East and John Newman. At the Royal Albert Hall,VE Day 80: The Party, will feature the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra and is organised by SSAFA, the Armed Forces charity. Outside London, elaborate VE Day celebrations are planned across the country. To search for an event in your local area, visit your council website or use theve-vjday80.go.uk. In Staffordshire, the Royal British Legion will host an anniversarytea party and service of remembranceat the National Memorial Arboretum on Thursday, bringing together one of the largest gatherings of WW2 veterans and their families on VE Day. InBelfast, there will be guided tours of wartime landmarks and a \"tea dance\" hosted in the City Hall. In Pontypool Wales,the Blaenavon Workmen's Hallis hosting a Great Victory Bake off, a Knit for Victory event and a costume competition. On the north coast of Scotland atBanff Castle, a \"full programme of music, dance and entertainment\" is slated for VE Day. The BBC will commemorate VE Day with a variety of special programmes.

    "title": "Royals watch Red Arrows flypast and have tea with veterans for VE Day anniversary",
    "article_text": "Four generations of the Royal Family appeared on Buckingham Palace's balcony to watch the Red Arrows flypast, marking 80 years since the end of World War Two in Europe. The King and senior royals watched on as a war-time Lancaster bomber led the 23-strong formation, including Typhoons and the Red Arrows, before waving to crowds. Following Queen Elizabeth II's death in 2022, this year is the first landmark Victory in Europe (VE Day) commemoration without any of the royals who stood on the balcony that day 80 years ago. It marked the first of four days of celebrations taking place across the country. At noon, the ceremony began with a recitation of Sir Winston Churchill's famous VE Day speech by actor Timothy Spall. The King and Queen were then joined by the Prince and Princess of Wales, and their children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, to watch a military procession through the capital on Monday. The military procession, including Nato allies and more than 1,300 members of the UK armed forces, made its way from Parliament Square to Buckingham Palace. The King stood and saluted as the procession reached the Queen Victoria Memorial. Later, the King and Queen were joined for the VE Day flypast on the Buckingham Palace balcony by Prince William and Catherine and their children, along with the Princess Royal, her husband Vice Adm Sir Tim Laurence, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh and the Duke of Kent - a first cousin of the late queen. A Lancaster bomber - the most successful RAF heavy bomber of World War Two - led the VE Day flypast, accompanied by aircraft including fighters jets, transport aircraft and the Red Arrows. The flyover narrowly avoided heavy rainfall as the weather began to change as crowds dispersed. After the display, Prince George joined his parents and the King at a veterans' tea party at Buckingham Palace, where he and Prince William spoke with 101-year-old Alfred Littlefield who served during D-Day. Samantha Davidson, 57, from Deanmead, Hampshire, said: \"The prince said George is very interested in finding out about the veterans. \"George even asked my grandfather how old he was during his service.\" Veterans and senior politicians enjoyed a selection of finger sandwiches, soup and homemade scotch eggs. The Royal Family is hoping\"nothing will detract or distract\"from the commemorations, following the Duke of Sussex's candid interview with the BBC on Friday, in which he discussed his estrangement from his father and desire for reconciliation. A VE Day street party was hosted by the prime minister at Downing Street. Sir Keir Starmer was joined by his wife Lady Starmer as they walked out of No 10 holding a plate of cakes, which he then handed out to some of the guests. VE Day was declared on 8 May 1945, after Britain and its allies formally accepted Nazi Germany's surrender after almost six years of war. At 15:00, the then-Prime Minister Winston Churchill announced World War Two in Europe had come to an end. Spontaneous celebrations erupted across the country, and the late queen and her sister Princess Margaret joined a group of friends to experience the excitement in London. On Monday morning, the excitement began early for Maria and Chris Naynor and their three grandchildren, who left their home in Reading at 05:30 BST to get a prime spot along the Mall - armed with cream tea and gin and tonics. Chris's father served in the armed forces and was wounded in Dunkirk, and his mother was out celebrating on the streets of London on VE Day in 1945. Maria said it was critical to remember \"all the people who gave their lives for freedom\" and teach children about it. To mark the historic event, the Cenotaph in Whitehall has been draped in a large Union flag - the first time the war memorial has been draped in Union Flags since it was unveiled by King George V more than a century ago, in 1920. Watching from the Mall, Grace Gothard, from Mitcham, made her Union Flag dress  draped with the Ghanian flag while Satvinder Cubb, from Chingford made a frock made from two \"Lest we forget\" scarves. Satvinder said they wanted to be in the capital to remember all the people \"who fought for us\", as the last generation of World War Two veterans were growing older. She described the message of VE Day as bringing together people from different countries and different age groups to say \"why don't we unite together? Why can't there be peace?\" Street partieswereheld across the UK, with some councils such as Portsmouth waiving fees to close roads for the celebrations. On Tuesday, the Queen will view an installation of30,000 ceramic poppies at the Tower of London.The Palace of Westminster, the Shard and Lowther Castle in Penrith are among buildings which will be illuminated from 21:00 BST. On Wednesday, the Parliament Choir will host a VE Day concert in Westminster Hall. A service at Westminster Abbey will begin with a national two-minute silence of remembrance on Thursday. Churches and cathedrals across the country will also ring their bells at 18:30 BST. Events will conclude with a concert at Horse Guards Parade, with stars of stage and screen telling the story of victory and the legacy of the Second World War. Pubs and bars in England and Wales which usually close at 23:00 BST will be able to keep serving for an extra two hours to celebrate on Thursday.

    "title": "Conclave: Inside the world's most secret ballot",
    "article_text": "This must be the most secretive election in the world. When 133 Catholic cardinals are shut into the Sistine Chapel on Wednesday to choose a successor to Pope Francis, each one will have sworn an oath on the gospels to keep the details under wraps for life. The same goes for every person inside the Vatican during the conclave: from the two doctors on hand for any emergency, to the dining-room staff who feed the cardinals. All vow to observe \"absolute and perpetual secrecy\". Just to be sure, the chapel and the two guesthouses will be swept for microphones and bugs. \"There are electronic jammers to make sure that phone and wi-fi signals are not getting in or out,\" said John Allen, the editor of Crux news site. \"The Vatican takes the idea of isolation extremely seriously.\" The lockdown isn't only about keeping the voting process secret. It is also intended to stop \"nefarious forces\" from hacking information or disrupting proceedings, and to ensure those voting are not influenced by the outside world on what will perhaps be one of the biggest decisions of their lives. Catholics will tell you the election is guided by God, not politics. But the hierarchy takes no chances. On entering the conclave, everyone is obliged to surrender all electronic devices including phones, tablets and smart watches. The Vatican has its own police to enforce the rules. \"The logic is trust but verify,\" John Allen said. \"There are no televisions, newspapers or radio at the guesthouse for the conclave – nothing,\" said Monsignor Paolo de Nicolo, who was head of the Papal household for three decades. \"You can't even open the windows because many rooms have windows to the exterior world.\" Everyone working behind the high Vatican walls for the conclave has been heavily vetted. Even so, they are barred from communicating with electors. \"The cardinals are completely incommunicado,\" said Ines San Martin of the Pontifical Mission Societies in the US. \"There will just be walkie-talkies for some specific circumstances like, 'we need a medic,' or 'Hey, the Pope has been elected, can someone let the bell-ringers in the Basilica know.'\" So what if someone breaks the rules? \"There is an oath, and those who do not observe it risk ex-communication,\" Msgr De Nicolo says, meaning exclusion from the church. \"No one dares to do this.\" It's a different matter in the run-up to the conclave. Officially, the cardinals are banned from commenting even now. But from the moment Pope Francis was buried, parts of the Italian press and many visitors turned cardinal-hunters, trying to suss out his most likely successor. They've been scouring establishments around the Vatican, ready to speculate on any sightings and possible alliances. \"Wine and Rigatoni: the Cardinals' Last Suppers\", was one headline in La Repubblica which described the \"princes of the church\" enjoying \"good Roman lunches\" before lockdown. Reporters have then been grilling waiters on what they might have overheard. \"Nothing,\" one of the servers at Roberto's, a couple of streets back from St Peter's, told me this week. \"They always go quiet whenever we get close.\" The other prime spot to catch a cardinal is beside the basilica itself, next to the curve of columns that embraces the main square. Each morning there's a huddle of cameras and reporters on the lookout for the men in lace and scarlet robes. There are now close to 250 cardinals in the city, called here from all over the world, although those aged 80 or over are not eligible to vote. As they head into the Vatican for their daily congregations to discuss the election, each one is surrounded and bombarded with questions on progress. They've given away little in response beyond the \"need for unity\" or assurances that the conclave will be short. \"The whole idea is for this to be a religious decision, not a political one,\" Ines San Martin explains. \"We say the Holy Spirit guides the conversation and the vote.\" But the Pope heads a huge, wealthy institution with significant moral authority and global sway on everything from conflict resolution to sexual politics. So the man chosen – and his vision and priorities – matter far beyond the Vatican. Certain Catholic monarchs had a veto on the election up until 1907. Today, voices from all quarters try to influence the debate – most obviously through the media. At one point, Rome's Il Messaggero chided a presumed front-runner, Italian Cardinal Parolin, for \"a sort of self-candidacy\". Then there was a video clip of Filipino Cardinal Tagle singing John Lennon's Imagine, apparently released to dent his popularity. It went viral instead. Meanwhile, a glossy book highlighting some potential contenders is doing the rounds, lauding conservatives like Cardinal Sarah of Guinea for condemning the \"contemporary evils\" of abortion and the \"same-sex agenda\". \"There are groups in town who are trying to bang the drum on issues of interest to them,\" John Allen says. \"The cardinals are aware of this kind of thing, they read the papers. But they will do everything they can to block it out.\" \"Are there lobbies going on? Yes, like in every election,\" Ines San Martin agrees. \"But it's not as loud as I thought it would be.\" She argues that is partly because Pope Francis appointed so many new cardinals, including from new places. \"Fifty or sixty percent of them don't even know one another. So even if you were an outside group, trying to have an agenda, it's very hard even to pick your cardinals to begin with.\" By Wednesday morning, all the electors should be in place inside the Vatican – stripped of their phones and sealed off from the rest of the world. John Allen believes personal preference will dominate over politics, 'liberal' or 'conservative' factions or the \"rattle and hum of public debate\". \"I really think the cardinals' discussions among themselves right now is key,\" said Ines San Martin. \"A lot have been speaking up for the first time. You never know just how inspiring one of them might be.\" One of the famous vehicles is being refitted as a frontline clinic on wheels, following a request by the late pontiff. Roman Catholic ex-pats in the north-west of England speak about their hopes for the next pope. Experts say the process requires \"two custom fireworks\", smoke test rehearsals and Vatican firefighters on standby. Robert Harris says the dynamic of the secretive ritual \"is why often it produces a surprise\". A pickup truck and a tourist van collide on a highway near the famous attraction in eastern Idaho.",

    "article_text": "Nothing has convinced Sabine Zetteler of the value of using AI. \"I read a really great phrase recently that said something along the lines of 'why would I bother to read something someone couldn't be bothered to write' and that is such a powerful statement and one that aligns absolutely with my views.\" Ms Zetteler runs her own London-based communications agency, with around 10 staff, some full-time some part-time. \"What's the point of sending something we didn't write, reading a newspaper written by bots, listening to a song created by AI, or me making a bit more money by sacking my administrator who has four kids? \"Where's the joy, love or aspirational betterment even just for me as a founder in that? It means nothing to me,\" she says. Ms Zetteler is among those resisting the AI invasion, which really got going with thelaunch of ChatGPTat the end of 2022. Since then the service, and its many rivals have become wildly popular. ChatGPT is racking up over five billion visits a month,according to software firm Semrush. But training AI systems like ChatGPT requires huge amounts of energy and, once trained, keeping them running is also energy intensive. While it's difficult to quantify the electricity used by AI,a report by Goldman Sachsestimated that a ChatGPT query uses nearly 10 times as much electricity as a Google search query. That makes some people uncomfortable. For Florence Achery, owner of Yoga Retreats & More, the environmental impact is one reason why she vows to stay away from AI. \"My initial reaction was that AI is soulless and is a contradiction with my business, which is all about human connection,\" says Achery, based in London. \"However, I found out that the environmental impact was awful with all the energy consumption required to run the data centres. I don't think that people are aware of that.\" While Ms Zetteler admits she respects AI for all the social-good it can achieve, she says she's concerned about the wider impact on society. \"I'm happy that AI exists for blind people if they can have articles translated by AI and anything that is truly beneficial. But in general, I don't think it will benefit us long-term.\" Is she worried it might have a knock-on effect on her business, especially if rival companies are using AI? \"Like everything, I could save money by sending our agency to Milan on EasyJet flights rather than the train. \"Already my profit margins look unsuccessful if that's how you measure success, but how about if you measure success by how much you're contributing to society and how well you sleep?\" Sierra Hansen, who lives in Seattle and works in public affairs, also refuses to use AI. For her, she's concerned that the use of AI is harming our ability to problem solve. \"Our brain is the thing that helps organise what our days look like, not going to AI Copilot and asking it to tell it how to manage my schedule. \"Our job as a human is to apply critical thinking skills, and if you are feeding simple tasks into ChatGPT then you're not solving on your own. It's doing the thinking for you. If I want to listen to music, I don't need AI to create the perfect punk rock album for me.\" But not everyone has the luxury of opting out of AI. Jackie Adams (not her real name), who works in digital marketing, resisted AI initially on environmental grounds, and because she thought using it was lazy. \"I heard about the energy needed to power data centres and the amount land they take up, and it didn't sit right with me. I didn't understand why we needed it,\" she says. However, about a year ago her three colleagues at the marketing firm she works for started adopting AI, for tasks such as copywriting and idea generation. Six months ago Ms Adams had to follow them, after being told she had to cut her budget. \"Then it was out my control,\" she says. She feels that continuing to resist would have hurt her career. \"I started playing with it a bit more after reading job descriptions asking for AI experience. I recently realised that if I don't implement it into my ways of working, I'm going to get left behind.\" Now, she says, she doesn't view tapping into AI as laziness anymore. \"It can elevate my work and make some things better,\" adding that she uses it to refine copywriting work and for editing photos. The moment to opt out of AI has already passed, says James Brusseau, a philosophy professor specialising in AI ethics at Pace University in New York. \"If you want to know why a decision is made, we will need humans. If we don't care about that, then we will probably use AI,\" he says. \"So, we will have human judges for criminal cases, and human doctors to make decisions about who should get the transplant. But, weather forecasting will be gone soon, and anesthesiology too,\" says Prof Brusseau. Ms Adam has accepted using AI at work, but she still feels despondent about AI's growing influence. \"Even when you do a Google search it includes an AI overview, while some emails have a topline summary, So now it almost feels like we have no control. How do I turn all that off? It's snowballing.\" The image, shared by White House social media accounts, comes as Catholics prepare to pick the next pontiff. Weather influencers can provide useful local information but are also accused of exaggerating conditions. Marc Edwards efforts to impress his grandparents have seen him become an in-demand movie-maker. Users said the chatbot endorsed ideas including stopping medication and getting angry at strangers Bug hunters make money by funding flaws in software, but AI is changing the way they work.",

    "title": "Is Trump's plan to reopen notorious Alcatraz prison realistic?",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has doubled down on his proposal to reopen and expand Alcatraz, the once-notorious prison island in the icy waters of San Francisco Bay. Alcatraz - popularly known as \"the Rock\" - has not been used as a prison for decades. It is now a historic landmark visited by millions of tourists each year. The US president says he believes the prison could be used once again to house dangerous inmates, and to serve as a symbol of law and order in the US. But experts say that refurbishing the dilapidated remains of the once-formidable prison is \"not realistic at all\". Here's what we know about the plan. Located on an island about 1.25 miles (2km) offshore from San Francisco, Alcatraz  originally was built as a naval defence fort, but was rebuilt in the early 20th century as a military prison. In 1934, it was formally converted into a federal prison - Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary - housing notorious inmates including gangster Al Capone, Mickey Cohen and George \"Machine Gun\" Kelly, among others. The prison was among one of the most notorious in the US at the time, and was considered inescapable because of the strong currents and frigid temperatures of San Francisco Bay. The facility also was made famous by the 1979 American biographical prison movie, Escape from Alcatraz, which recounted a 1962 prisoner escape, starring Clint Eastwood as ringleader Frank Morris. It was also the site of the 1996 film The Rock, starring Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage, about a former SAS captain and FBI chemist who rescue hostages from Alcatraz Island. According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, BOP, it was nearly three times more costly to operate than other federal institutions and was ultimately closed by Attorney General Robert Kennedy in 1963. The island and prison are now a museum operated by the National Park Service. More than 1.4m people visit each year. \"Alcatraz is a place where the past meets the present,\" Christine Lehnertz, president and CEO of the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, said in a statement sent to the BBC. \"It challenges us to listen, to learn, and to carry forward the stories that still shape our world today,\" she added. Donald Trump is not the first president to mull re-opening the facility as a detention centre. In 1981, Alcatraz was one of 14 sites considered by the Reagan administration to hold up to 20,000 refugees who had fled from Cuba to Florida in the famous \"Mariel Boatlift\". The site eventually was rejected due to its value as a historical tourist site and its complete lack of adequate facilities. In a Truth Social post on 4 May, Trump first said he had directed his government to re-open and expand the island prison, saying that \"for too long America has been plagued by vicious, violent, and repeat criminal offenders\". Speaking to reporters at the White House the following day, Trump said that, in his view, Alcatraz \"represents something very strong, very powerful\" - law and order. \"We need law and order in this country,\" he said. \"So we're going to look at it. Some of the people up here are going to be working very hard on that.\" While he said he finds the idea \"interesting\", Trump also acknowledged that the prison is currently a \"big hulk\" that is \"rusting and rotting\". \"It sort of represents something that is both horrible and beautiful and strong and miserable,\" he said. Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, also told reporters that Alcatraz could be \"an option\" for \"significant public safety threats and national security threats\". \"It should be on the table,\" he added. Soon after Trump's comments made news around the world, justice department spokesman Chad Gilmartin said in a statement that BOP \"is working towards rebuilding and opening Alcatraz to serve as a symbol of law and order\". But prison experts and historians have expressed serious doubts whether the plan is feasible. \"To be frank, at first I thought it was a joke,\" Hugh Hurwitz, who served as acting director of the BOP between May 2018 and August 2019, told the BBC. \"It's not realistic to think you can repair it. You'd have to tear it up and start over.\" Mr Hurwitz pointed to a number of issues with the facility, including buildings that are \"literally falling apart\", and cells in which \"a six-foot person can't stand up\". \"There's no security upgrades. No cameras. No fencing,\" he added. \"You can't run a prison.\" \"I have two words: water and sewage,\" said Jolene Babyak, an author and Alcatraz historian who lived there as a child during her father's two stints as prison administrator. \"In its heyday, all the sewage for 500 or more people was just dumped in the bay,\" she said. \"Nowadays it has to be boated off. It's just not realistic at all. But it captures everyone's imagination.\" When the facility closed in 1963, the BOP said it was nearly three times more expensive to operate Alcatraz than any other federal prison - the per-capita cost  being $10 and $13 per inmate, compared to between $3 and $5 at other facilities. This was in part because it required food and supplies to be dropped off by boat. In today's federal prisons, the per capita cost for inmates is between $120 and $164 - meaning that costs could rise to over $500 per person in a facility like Alcatraz. Alcatraz could hold only about 340 prisoners at its peak. \"It was mind bogglingly expensive to keep a convict there,\" said John Martini, a historian who spent several years on Alcatraz as a ranger with the National Park Service. \"Things have not changed. But the place has gone downhill.\" \"It's basically a shell. Even the concrete has major problems. The Park Service has put millions into structurally stabilising it,\" he added. \"They would need water, electricity, heat, and sanitation. None of those functions.\" \"This [Trump's comments] are just another twist in the odd history of Alcatraz,\" Mr Martini added. At least two children are reported missing as the US Coast Guard searches for survivors, just north of San Diego. The BBC's Anthony Zurcher looks at how past Oval Office meetings could set the tone for the prime minister's visit to Washington. The incident led to multiple employees being on trauma leave, contributing to hundreds of delayed or diverted flights.

    "title": "India worried about Chinese 'dumping' as trade tensions with Trump escalate",
    "article_text": "The pace at 64-year-old Thirunavkarsu's spinning mill in southern India's Tamil Nadu state has noticeably slowed down. The viscose yarn – a popular material that goes into making woven garments – he produces, now sits in storage, as orders from local factories have dropped nearly 40% in the last month. That's because Chinese import of the material has become cheaper by 15 rupees ($0.18; £0.13) per kilo and has flooded Indian ports. With Donald Trump imposing tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese goods going into the US, manufacturers in China have begun looking for alternative markets. India's textiles makers say they are bearing the brunt of the trade tensions as Chinese producers are dumping yarn in key production hubs. While China is the leading producer of viscose yarn, India makes mostof the viscose yarn the country needs locally with imports only bridging supply gaps. Mill owners like Thirunavkarsu fear their yarn won't survive the onslaught of such competition. \"We can't match these rates. Our raw material is not as cheap,\" he says. Jagadesh Chandran, of the South India Spinners Association, told the BBC nearly 50 small spinning mills in the textile hubs of Pallipalayam, Karur and Tirupur in southern India are \"slowing production\". Many say they'll be forced to scale down further if the issue isn't addressed. China's Ambassador to India, Xu Feihong has sent assurances to India that his country will not dump products and in fact wants to buy more high-quality Indian products for Chinese consumers. \"We will not engage in market dumping or cut-throat competition, nor will we disrupt other countries' industries and economic development,\" he wrote in an opinion piece for the Indian Express newspaper. But anxieties about dumping are spread across sectors in India, as China - Asia's biggest economy - is the world's largest exporter of practically all industrial goods, from textiles and metals, to chemicals and rare minerals. While pharmaceuticals - and later phones, laptops, and semiconductor chips - were exempted from steep tariffs, large chunks of Chinese exports still run into Trump's 145% tariff wall. It is these goods that are expected to chase other markets like India. Their sudden inflow will prove \"very disruptive\" to emerging economies in Asia, according to Japanese broking house Nomura, whose research earlier revealed that China was flooding global markets with cheap goods even before Donald Trump took office earlier this year. In 2024, investigations against unfair Chinese imports rose to a record high. Data from the World Trade Organisation (WTO) shows, nearly 200 complaints were filed against China at the forum - a record - including 37 from India. India in particular, with heavy dependencies on Chinese raw materials and intermediate goods, could be hit hard. Its trade deficit with China - the difference between what it imports and exports - has already ballooned to $100bn (£75bn). And imports in March jumped 25%, driven by electronics, batteries and solar cells. In response, India's trade ministry has set up a committee to track the influx of cheap Chinese goods, with its quasi-judicial arm probing imports across sectors, including viscose yarn. India also recently imposed a 12% tax on some steel imports, locally known as a safeguard duty, to help halt an increase in cheap shipments primarily from China, which were pushing some Indian mills to scale down. Despite such protections-and a loud marketing campaign by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government to boost manufacturing locally - India has found it hard to reduce its reliance on China, with imports rising even whenborder tensions between the two neighbours peaked after 2020. That's because the government has only had \"limited success\" with its plans to turn India into the world's factory through things like the production linked subsidies, says Biswajit Dhar, a Delhi-based trade expert. And India continues to depend heavily on China for the intermediate goods that go into manufacturing finished products. While western multi-nationalcompanies like Apple are increasingly looking towards Indiato diversify their assembly lines away from China, India is still dependent on Chinese components to make these phones. As a result, imports in sectors like electronics have risen significantly, pushing up its trade deficit. India's burgeoning deficit is a \"worrying story\", says Ajay Srivastava, founder of the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) think tank, all the more so because its exports to China have dropped to below 2014 levels despite a weaker currency, which should ideally help exporters. \"This isn't just a trade imbalance. It's a structural warning. Our industrial growth, including through PLI (production linked incentive) schemes, is fuelling imports, not building domestic depth,\" Srivastava wrote in a social media post.In other words, the subsidies are not helping India export more. \"We can't bridge this deficit without bridging our competitiveness gap.\" India needs to get its act together quickly to do that, given the opportunity US trade tensions with China have presented. But also because countries with a large rise in imports from China generally tend to see the sharpest slowdown in manufacturing growth, according to Nomura. Akash Prakash of Amansa Capital agrees. A key reason why Indian private companies were not investing enough, was because they feared being \"swamped by China\", he wrote in a column in the Business Standard newspaper. A recent study by the ratings agency Icra also corroborates this view. With fears of Chinese dumping becoming more widespread and the likes of the European Union seeking firm guarantees from Beijing that its markets will not be flooded, pressure is mounting on China - which is now urgently looking to secure newer trading partners outside the US. China wants to completely shift the narrative, says Mr Dhar, \"It is trying to come clean amidst increased scrutiny\". Despite the reassurances from Beijing, Delhi should usethawing relationswith its larger neighbour to kickstart a proper dialogue on its firm stance about dumping, says Mr Dhar. \"This is an issue that India must flag, like most of the Western countries have.\" Follow BBC News India onInstagram,YouTube,TwitterandFacebook.

    "title": "What will Trump's film tariffs mean for Hollywood - and the UK?",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has said he will hit movies made in foreign countries with 100% tariffs, as he ramps up trade disputes with nations around the world. Trump said in a post onTruth Socialthat he was authorising the US Department of Commerce and Trade Representative to start the process to impose the levy because America's movie industry was dying \"a very fast death\". He later said he would consult Hollywood executives to see if \"they're happy\" with his proposal, after the news sent shockwaves through the industry. So what might this mean for both the US film industry and the global movie business, including the UK? Announcing the new tariffs, Trump declared that Hollywood was \"dying\". So is it? It's true that the industry has been through a really rough time in recent years. The pandemic saw production close down and the impact is ongoing. Hollywood studios spent $11.3 billion on productions in the second quarter of 2024,a 20% drop from the same period in 2022, as studios continued to cut costs in an attempt to recover from Covid losses. Any shoots of recovery were then severely stifled by the 2023 actors and writers strikes. Then the wildfires struck earlier this year. And for several years now, more and more people - not just youngsters - have been turning to YouTube and other streaming platforms for content. The US remains a major film production hub andaccording to Variety, 2025 has seen a rebound in box office numbers since last year, with overall domestic revenues up 15.8% on 2024 so far. The latestMarvel superhero film, Thunderbolts*, topped the North American box office this weekend, raking in an estimated $76 million, marking a promising start to the summer season. But Hollywood is definitely still up against it. The president says he wants to \"immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% tariff on any and all movies coming into our country that are produced in foreign lands. We want movies made in America again!\" This has led to questions about whether the tariffs would also apply to American film companies producing films abroad. Several recent major movies produced by US studios were shot outside America, including Deadpool & Wolverine, Wicked and Gladiator II. Hit franchises like Mission Impossible also shoot overseas. We also don't yet know if the tariffs will be applied retrospectively. Trump later told reporters that \"other nations have been stealing the movies and movie-making capabilities from the United States\", which may suggest he was only referring to non-US films. White House spokesman Kush Desai told the BBC that \"no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made\", and added that the administration is \"exploring all options\". We will have to wait for more detail. Many countries offer tax breaks to encourage film production such as New Zealand, Australia and the UK and that's something Trump wants to take on. But it's not the only reason a US film company might wish to film abroad. Some choose to do so for the specific location, exotic and exciting backdrops for example. Who could forget Tom Cruise's ascent of the Burj Khalifa, Dubai, in Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol? What could it mean for the next James Bond movie, a franchise now owned by US giant Amazon, but based on an iconic British character who works for MI6, based in London? And it's not just other countries that offer incentives - other US states are luring film production away from Hollywood. Georgia, Illinois and Kentucky are among the many other US states which California are now competing with. Gavin Newsom, California's governor, who Trump described as \"grossly incompetent\" when speaking about the movie tariffs on Monday, is currently pushing for his plan to more than double the state's film and TV tax incentives to $750 million annually. While Newsom has made no comment yet on Trump's proposal,his senior communications advisor told Deadline: \"We believe he has no authority to impose tariffs under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, since tariffs are not listed as a remedy under that law.\" There are more questions than answers at this stage. The World Trade Organization (WTO) has a moratorium on tariffs for digital goods until 2026. Presumably films count as digital goods. And what would they base the tariffs on? Box office revenue or production costs? Is streaming content included? That would have a huge impact on US companies like Netflix. What about post-production ie editing? Tim Richards, Vue Entertainment CEO and founder, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"A big part of this is what constitutes US film - is it where the money comes from, the script, the director, the talent, where it was shot?\" And how do you even classify a foreign film when so many are co-productions and are often shot in several countries? Trump appeared to be talking about film and not TV but it's not 100% clear at this stage. Would tariffs apply to films made for streaming or just cinema releases? We'll have to wait for more detail. And of course, Trump may rollback on the proposals as he has done with some other tariffs. Obviously, putting a 100% tariff on foreign films means a huge cost increase for those production companies who want to sell to the US market. Commenting on Trump's announcement, the UK government's Culture Media and Sport Committee chair Dame Caroline Dinenage MP said: \"Last month the Culture, Media and Sport Committee warned against complacency on our status as the Hollywood of Europe. President Trump's announcement has made that warning all too real. \"Making it more difficult to make films in the UK is not in the interests of American businesses. Their investment in facilities and talent in the UK, based on US-owned IP, is showing fantastic returns on both sides of the Atlantic. Ministers must urgently prioritise this as part of the trade negotiations currently under way.\" Head of media and entertainment trade union Bectu in the UK, Philippa Childs, said in a statement: \"These tariffs, coming after Covid and the recent slowdown, could deal a knock-out blow to an industry that is only just recovering and will be really worrying news for tens of thousands of skilled freelancers who make films in the UK.\" Kirsty Bell, chief executive of production company Goldfinch, questioned how the tariffs would work, pointing out that blockbusters like Barbie, which was distributed by US film studio Warner Bros Pictures, \"was actually shot virtually entirely in the UK\". \"If those US films don't get partly produced or produced in the UK, freelancers are going to be jobless. I'm telling you now, they really are going to be jobless,\" she told PA. The governments of Australia and New Zealand have also spoken out in support of their countries' film industries. \"Nobody should be under any doubt that we will be standing up unequivocally for the rights of the Australian screen industry,\" Australia's home affairs minister Tony Burke said. New Zealand's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon told a news conference that his government was awaiting further details of the proposed tariffs. \"But we'll be obviously a great advocate, great champion of that sector and that industry,\" he added. And with the Cannes film festival just around the corner, uncertainty hangs in the air with many US film producers looking to sell foreign distribution rights. Tariffs could incentivise US film companies to make more films on home soil but the risk is that if it's more expensive than to do so abroad, some films just won't get made. More incentives or rebates could help offset this but we just don't know at this stage if that's under discussion on a national scale. NPR Radio film critic Eric Deggans warned that the tariffs, should they be introduced, could further harm the industry. Other countries may respond by placing tariffs on American films, he told the BBC, making it \"harder for these films to make profits overseas\". \"It may create a situation where the tariffs in America are causing more harm than good,\" he added. The BBC's Anthony Zurcher looks at how past Oval Office meetings could set the tone for the prime minister's visit to Washington. As Trump orders the reopening of the notorious prison, Lily Jamali takes a closer look at what draws tourists there. Experts say the federal government would have to overcome enormous hurdles to turn Alcatraz back into a prison. The president blamed foreign-made movies for the American film industry's \"very fast death\".

    "article_text": "This video can not be played Zhao beats Williams in historic final - highlights Zhao Xintong made history as he became the first player from China to win the World Championship with an 18-12 victory over Mark Williams in Sheffield. The 28-year-old had extended his 11-6 overnight lead with a dominant display on Monday afternoon to begin the concluding session 17-8 ahead. Willed on by a buoyant Crucible crowd, three-time winner Williams compiled wonderful breaks of 101, 96 and 73 on his way to collecting the first four frames of the evening. And 40 years on from the iconic black-ball final when Dennis Taylor came from 8-0 and 9-1 down to defeat Steve Davis, it briefly raised hopes of another astonishing revival. However, the Welshman, who has already achieved a notable landmark by becoming the Crucible's oldest ever finalist, six weeks after turning 50, was ultimately only able to delay the inevitable. Having largely been consigned to his seat, Zhao - whose journey to becoming champion remarkably began 29 days ago and included him having to win four qualifying matches and 111 frames in total - wrapped up a famous success with a run of 87. It was no more than his scintillating form over the 17-day televised event deserved. \"This is like a dream. I can't believe it. There was big pressure and big nerves. I knew if I missed he could come back quickly,\" he told BBC Sport. \"I was so nervous tonight. Mark is still a top player and put me under so much pressure. He's the best.\" Along with the Â£500,000 top prize, he will climb to 11th in the world rankings when he returns to the main professional tour next season. Zhao, who won the UK title in 2021, is the first amateur to triumph at the Crucible. He also becomes only the third qualifier after Terry Griffiths and Shaun Murphy to claim snooker's biggest prize since the tournament's 1977 move to Sheffield. His achievement is all the more extraordinary given he was still suspended from the sport 12 months ago, with his burgeoning career abruptly halted when he was one of 10 Chinese players sanctioned in 2023 followingan investigation into match-fixing. While Zhao did not directly throw a match, he accepted charges of being a party to another player fixing two matches and betting on matches himself, and for those offences he received a 20-month ban. His win over Williams was his 47th from 49 matches this term and vindicated the bookmakers' decisions to install him as one of the favourites before the tournament even got under way. Trailblazer Zhao set to take snooker to 'another level' in China Match-fixing scandal to Crucible champion - fall and rise of Zhao World Championship: Results, schedule & roll of honour This video can not be played I can't believe what I have achieved this month - Xintong Zhao's win over Williams was a long-awaited moment for China, nine years on from Ding Junhui's 18-14 defeat by Mark Selby in the 2016 final. \"It is very good for Chinese snooker and I am very happy I have done this for them. \"I can't believe I could become world champion in such a short time [after the ban] so I am so proud of myself. It was nearly two years playing no competition, so my first target was to qualify. \"Now this will give them [children in China] power and in the future many Chinese players can do this.\" It simply looked like a match too far for Williams, who overcamewell-documented eye problemsto reach a fifth final. He appeared drained at times, following his semi-final success against world number one Judd Trump. The 'Welsh Potting Machine' lost the two afternoon sessions by an aggregate score of 13-3 - a margin that proved too wide in a match which is sure to be viewed as a changing-of-the-guard moment. \"Unfortunately I was just never in the final from day one. I was behind from the start and could not get into it,\" said Williams. \"I said that if I could get out of the first session at 5-3 down it would have been a result, but I was 7-1 down and it was a bit far for me to get back. \"I've got nothing but admiration for what he's done, coming through the qualifiers.

    "title": "Air traffic controllers at New York airport briefly lost contact with planes, union says",
    "article_text": "Air traffic controllers at Newark Liberty International Airport briefly lost communications with planes under their control, \"unable to see, hear, or talk to them\" last week, officials say. The 28 April incident led to multiple employees going on trauma leave,  contributing to hundreds of delayed flights. More than 150 flights were cancelled  on Monday alone, according to tracking website FlightAware. The airport, one of New York's busiest hubs, has been grappling with staff shortages for more than a week. US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on Monday that contact with air traffic was lost for \"30 seconds\", but it did not mean that the planes were going to crash. \"The primary communication line went down, the backup line didn't fire, and so for 30 seconds we lost contact with air traffic,\" Duffy told Fox News \"Now were planes going to crash? No. They have communication devices. ... But it's a sign that we have a frail system in place, and it has to be fixed.\" The Federal Aviation Administration also acknowledged in a statement  that \"our antiquated air traffic control system is affecting our work force\". Confirming the controllers were on leave following the incident, the FAA said it could \"not quickly replace them\". \"We continue to train controllers who will eventually be assigned to this busy airspace,\" the statement said. Air traffic control operations at the airport have come under sustained criticism recently. Last week, United Airlines announced it was cancelling 35 flights per day from its Newark schedule because the airport \"cannot handle the number of planes that are scheduled to operate there\". \"In the past few days, on more than one occasion, technology that FAA air traffic controllers rely on to manage the airplanes coming in and out of Newark airport failed - resulting in dozens of diverted flights, hundreds of delayed and cancelled flights,\" United CEO Scott Kirby said. He also said the issues were \"compounded\" because over 20% of FAA controllers \"walked off the job\". The National Air Traffic Controllers Association said the employees took leave under provisions for workers who experience a traumatic event at work. The union would not say how many controllers had taken leave, or how long they lost contact with planes. The incident comes as the US Department of Transportation last week unveiled a package designed to boost the numbers of FAA air traffic controllers. The department said it was on track to hire at least 2,000 controllers this year. In February, the Trump administrationbegan firing hundreds of FAA employees, weeks after a fatal mid-air plane collision in Washington DC. Transport secretary Duffy said he planned to unveil a plan on Thursday to seek billions of dollars from Congress to reform infrastructure and staffing. \"We're going to build a brand new air traffic control system, from new telecom to new radars to new infrastructure,\" he told Fox News.

    "title": "OpenAI says non-profit will remain in control after backlash",
    "article_text": "OpenAI, the parent of artificial intelligence service ChatGPT, has announced a new governance plan after a bitter power struggle over the business. Boss Sam Altman said OpenAI would remain under the control of its for-profit board, while becoming what is known in the US as a public benefit corporation. Mr Altman had put forwarda similar plan in December- but without clarifying the control of the non-profit. The update follows widespread scrutiny of the startup, which began as a non-profit and faced criticism, including from co-founder Elon Musk, that its quest for growth is pushing it to stray from its original mission of creating technology for the benefit of humanity. Last month, a group of former open AI staff and outside experts, including Geoffrey Hinton,wrote to regulators in California and Delaware, which have power over non-profits, asking them to intervene to block the conversion. OpenAI chairman Bret Taylor said the start-up made the decision \"after hearing from civic leaders and engaging in constructive dialogue with the offices of the Attorney General of Delaware and the Attorney General of California\". In the update on Monday, Mr Altman said the non-profit would continue to control OpenAI, receiving a \"big\", yet-to-be determined stake in OpenAI's business arm, which would give it access to money to put towards its own goals. He said the new plan would still allow the organisation to stop operating under its current complex governance structure, which had capped its profits. That was seen as a sticking point for investors, including Microsoft, that hindered the firm's ability to raise money. \"We are moving to a normal capital structure where everyone has stock,\" he wrote in a letter to staff that was shared on the OpenAI website. \"This is not a sale, but a change of structure to something simpler.\" Unlike traditional for-profit companies, which are bound to act in service to shareholders, a public benefit corporation is also responsible for a public mission. In the update on Monday, Mr Altman said he believed that growth and extending access to AI, which would take money, was consistent with the firm's mission, because it would help people \"build incredible things for each other and continue to drive society and quality of life forward\". \"It will of course not be all used for good, but we trust humanity and think the good will outweigh the bad by orders of magnitude,\" he wrote. It is not clear to what extent the new plan will satisfy investors or critics. After the announcement Page Hedley, OpenAI's former policy and ethics adviser, who had spearheaded last month's letter, said the update did not resolve issues such as who would own the firm's technology and how its goals would be prioritised. \"We're glad that OpenAI is listening to concerns from civil society leaders ... but crucial questions remain,\" he said. The firms join a growing list of big businesses cautioning about the impact of Trump's import taxes. Worried about the environment and the loss of skills, some people are resisting the rise of AI. The president blamed foreign-made movies for the American film industry's \"very fast death\". The South American country is turning to wind power, but some local people are unhappy.

    "title": "Wildfire destroys 12,500 acres of land on Dartmoor",
    "article_text": "A large wildfire on Dartmoor that started on Sunday afternoon has destroyed about 12,500 acres (50 sq km) of land. Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service said at its peak the blaze stretched across an area 3km (1.9 miles) by 1.4km (0.9 miles) and crews from 13 stations were deployed to the Dartmoor Forest area near Cut Hill. Wildlife support officers and a police helicopter were also deployed, which confirmed there were no concerns about injuries or missing people. In an update at 17:00 BST on Monday the fire service confirmed the fire was out. A drone team and two all-terrain vehicles were used to check for any hot spots after the fire service said \"all fire fronts were extinguished\" on Monday afternoon. It said Dartmoor Rangers would revisit the site on Tuesday. The fire service said: \"Crews were assisted by Dartmoor rangers and commoners using firefighting equipment. \"Crews used five Argo Cat vehicles, fogging units, leaf blowers and a drone for environmental protection.\" The BBC understands the fire service are still investigating the cause of the fire. Earlier it had asked people to avoid the area and advised anyone whose property was affected by the smoke to close their windows. At about 10:45 BST, a spokesperson for the fire service asked people to avoid the Merrivale and the Okehampton range areas. There were 10 appliances at the scene, most of which were \"special fire appliances for moorland firefighting\", the spokesperson said. The service’s Devon area manager, Simon Young, said: \"Wildfires are always challenging because they are inaccessible for our appliances to go onto our moorland.” \"It makes it very difficult, but we have specialist vehicles to make sure we have capability to get onto the moor and make sure we can do the job as safely as possible. \"The wind has really played its part and we are currently under amber wildfire conditions nationally for the next three to four days. \"We know the conditions are very dry under foot and with the wind it has just exacerbated it.\" Head Ranger at Dartmoor National Park Simon Lee said there was \"significant damage\" and there was concern around wildlife and the fabric of the moor. He said with it being a Bank Holiday weekend, they are advising people to leave this section of the moor alone, and not be tempted to \"have a look\". \"Let us and the emergency services do their work and not to light BBQs or fires while Dartmoor is vulnerable due to the ongoing dry weather,\" said Mr Lee. The fire started at about 14:30 on Sunday and has been \"burning all night\", he said. He said they were unable to get four-wheeled vehicles to access the fire, and they had used quadbikes and argocats, but even then, it was \"quite a struggle\". Mr Lee said a police helicopter on Sunday evening advised people camping and visiting to \"move on\". Devon and Cornwall Police warned people travelling in the area to be aware of increased levels of smoke and the risk of reduced visibility on the road. Follow BBC Devon onX,FacebookandInstagram.

    "title": "French minister apologises to Liverpool fans over Champions League chaos",
    "article_text": "France's former interior minister has apologised for the first time forthe 2022 fiasco at the Stade de Francewhich saw Liverpool football supporters wrongly blamed for a riot. Gérald Darmanin admitted that security arrangements for the Champions League final between Liverpool and Real Madrid were wrong, and that his first public remarks – blaming English fans – were a mistake. \"It was a failure because I had not foreseen.  That was a mistake on my part. I was led astray by my preconceptions,\" said Darmanin, now France's justice minister. \"The scapegoat was easy to find, and I apologise now to Liverpool supporters. They were quite right to be hurt. It was a mistake and a failure.\" Police used tear gas on Liverpool supporters as they tried to enter the stadium in Paris. Some fans were also ambushed and mugged by gangs of French youths. In a lengthy interview on the Legend YouTube channel, Darmanin said the night was \"the biggest failure\" of his career. \"What I did not appreciate that evening was that the real problem was not coming from English supporters, but from delinquents who were robbing fans. \"Our security arrangements were not designed for that eventuality.  We had riot police … with big boots and shields – not great for running. What you need against that kind of delinquency is officers in running shoes. \"We got our arrangements wrong.  We were expecting a war of (football) hooligans, and what we got instead was muggers.\" In their first comments after the problems, Darmanin and police chief Didier Lallement said the dangerous crush at the stadium was largely caused by Liverpool fans in possession of fake tickets. The claim was subsequently debunked in an independent report commissioned by UEFA. In another section of the interview, Darmanin said that there was \"no longer any safe place\" in France - a comment that drew fire from the hard-right opposition. \"What a lot of French people can see is that (violence) has become general, it has metastasised.  It's no longer only in the places where you once looked for potential problems. \"Nowadays you can see that the tiniest country village has experience of cocaine or cannabis.\" National Rally MP Jean-Philippe Tanguy noted that Darmanin has been in government since President Emmanuel Macron's first election in 2017. Tungay said he was \"treating the French like imbeciles, making all these so-called tough declarations when the record is so catastrophic\". Darmanin, who is 42 and from the political right, did nothing in the interview to dispel speculation that he might be in the running to replace Macron in 2027. \"Do I think of the presidential election? The answer is yes,\" he said. \"That does not mean that I am going to be a candidate, but it does mean I have ambitions for the country to do better than what I see now.\"",

    "title": "Iranian men questioned by police over alleged UK terror plot",
    "article_text": "Four men are continuing to be questioned by police over an alleged terror plot in the UK. The men, who areIranian nationals, are being held over an alleged plan to target \"a specific premises\", the Metropolitan Police said. A fifth Iranian man who was also detained has been released on bail, the Met added. The men were arrested in Swindon, west London, Stockport, Rochdale and Manchester. Police arrested the five men - two aged 29, a 40-year-old, a 24-year-old and another aged 46 - in the early hours of Saturday morning. The Met said it obtained warrants to further detain four of the menuntil Saturday. They were originally detained under the Terrorism Act. The fifth man, who was detained under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE), was released on bail with conditions until a date in May. The Met said the \"affected site\" allegedly targeted in the plot had been made aware and was being supported by police. Officers are carrying out searches at a number of addresses in Greater Manchester, London and Swindon. Footage showed armed officers taking a man from a house in Rochdale, while another man was dragged through the street in Swindon with plastic bags over his arms. It is understood military personnel were involved in the Rochdale raid. In Swindon, one eyewitness told the BBC that six men entered a cafe the suspect was in and ordered coffee and donuts before they followed him out and \"jumped on him\". Cdr Dominic Murphy, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command, said officers \"are progressing what is a significant and highly complex investigation\". \"The investigation is still in its early stages and we are exploring various lines of enquiry to establish any potential motivation as well as to identify whether there may be any further risk to the public linked to this matter,\" he added. Meanwhile, a father has said his 14-year-old son was mistakenly arrested during terror arrests in the Cheadle Hulme area of Stockport. The boy told Manchester Evening News when officers with balaclavas pulled up in the street he ran away fearing a kidnap attempt, and said a gun was put in his face and a knee put on his neck. \"I didn't see their hats and they didn't shout police. I thought it was a kidnapping - I just ran away,\" he told the newspaper. The Metropolitan Police said that, during the Stockport arrest, three people nearby appeared to run away from the location prompting officers to detain them. A spokesperson said: \"Due to the severity of the alleged offences being investigated, and to ensure public safety, officers detained the three individuals to ensure they were not linked to the matter being investigated or a threat to the public. \"Officers were subsequently able to establish they were not of any concern and the two adult males and the 14-year-old boy were released.\" Three other Iranian men - aged 39, 44 and 55 - were arrested in London on Saturday in relation to a separate counter terrorism investigation, under section 27 of the National Security Act, the Met said. The act covers offences deemed a threat to national security. Section 27 grants police the power to arrest someone without a warrant if they are reasonably suspected of being involved in \"foreign power threat activity\". Warrants of further detention have been obtained for the three men, meaning they can be detained until Saturday, police said. Cdr Murphy stressed that they were not linking the two investigations. He said the operations were \"certainly significant and it is unusual for us to conduct this scale of activity\". On Sunday, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the two operations \"reflect some of the biggest counter state threat and counter terrorism operations that we have seen in recent years\". Last year MI5 said it had responded to 20 Iran-backed plots since January 2022. Director general Sir Ken McCallum, said thesepresented \"potentially lethal threats to British citizens and UK residents\". There have previously been calls to designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps - a major military and political force with close ties to Iran's leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei - as a proscribed terrorist organisation in the UK. This would allow tighter control of UK borders and \"severe penalties\" for those who might be supporting the group\", Nick Aldworth, a former national co-ordinator for counter terrorism policing, said. \"It becomes quite challenging when organisations that are proscribed are effectively part of the state,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He added it was \"unclear\" how much support the group had in the UK. Jonathan Hall KC, an independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said the public was not aware of \"how aggressive Iran is willing to be\", adding UK authorities \"undoubtedly\" need more tools to deal with this particular case. The use of the internet to organise attacks should be examined \"remorselessly,\" and people made aware of the full extent of the law, he told the BBC. The Metropolitan Police say there are 'grounds for further investigation' into the videos. The body of the man, aged in his 30s, was found on Wednesday morning near Partridge Chase. Counter-terror police say they are keeping an \"open mind\" as they investigate the attack at HMP Frankland. A 38-year-old man was arrested as he flew in to Stanstead Airport.

    "title": "Trailblazer Zhao set to take snooker to 'another level' in China",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played Zhao beats Williams in historic final - highlights Within minutes of becoming China's trailblazing world snooker champion, Zhao Xintong was draped in his country's flag as he started to take in the enormity of his achievement. Zhaodefeated three-time winner Mark Williams 18-12on Mondayto become the first Asian player and amateur to triumph at the Crucible. Williams called the 28-year-old a \"superstar\", and Jason Ferguson - chairman of the sport's governing body - said Zhao was set to take snooker \"to another level\". \"We are talking about a national hero - he has entered the history books of this sport and in China he will probably be one of the biggest stars there,\" Ferguson, chairman of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA), told BBC Sport. \"Snooker is so big in China. He is young, talented and entertaining and speaks both English and Mandarin. This is going to take snooker to another level. \"China loves its heroes and winners. Some countries back underdogs but in China they really celebrate their champions. He has the ability to become the most popular sporting star in the country.\" The 28-year-old also became only the third qualifier after Terry Griffiths and Shaun Murphy to capture snooker's biggest prize since the tournament moved to Sheffield in 1977. His achievement is all the more extraordinary given he only returned from a 20-month suspension earlier this season after being one of10 players from China sanctioned in a match-fixing scandal. However, he carried over the scintillating form he has shown all season on the amateur Q Tour and remarkably became the first player to come through four qualifying matches and then lift the trophy at snooker's most famous venue. After the final Williams said: \"I'm glad I'll be too old when he's dominating the game. I've got nothing but admiration for what he's done, coming through the qualifiers. He hasn't played for two years, bashed everybody up. There's a new superstar of the game.\" \"It could be huge for the sport. It could open floodgates everywhere. He could dominate or at least give [Judd] Trump or Kyren [Wilson] a run for their money. With the Luke Littler thing in darts. This is what snooker needed, someone like him coming through. \"It is bound to open doors. It will be front page on every news outlet going.\" Zhao's success completes a double for the country, which has more than 300,000 snooker clubs for its population of 1.4 billion. Bai Yulu was the first Chinese winner of the women's world championship in 2024 and will defend her title in her homeland this month. May Zhao, who is in Sheffield to report for the International Sport Press Association, added:  \"Zhao's victory is not only a personal triumph but also a historic breakthrough for Chinese snooker. \"I think he will be given a huge reception when he returns to the country and this win is sure to inspire the younger generation in China and drive the development of the country's training system and structure. \"It has the potential to reshape the commercial landscape of the game. He is not just a champion - he is a trailblazer for a new era of Chinese snooker.\" Zhao claims historic victory over Williams in Crucible final Match-fixing scandal to Crucible champion - fall and rise of Zhao World Championship 2025: Results, prize money & roll of honour This video can not be played I can't believe what I have achieved this month - Xintong While a record 10 Chinese players qualified for the televised stage of the World Championship this year, prior to the start of the tournament only four, Ding Junhui (sixth), Zhang Anda (11th), Xiao Guodong (12th) and Si Jiahui (14th) sat inside the game's elite top 16. It should also be noted that the top five players in the world are all British, and that world number one Judd Trump and 13th-ranked Shaun Murphy won the two other Triple Crown events - the UK Championship and the Masters. Indeed, Trump and 2024 world champion Kyren Wilson won seven major finals between them this season, while until Monday evening Chinese success has been limited to two events on home soil and Lei Peifan's win in the Scottish Open. Yet Zhao's achievement, which will parachute him in at number 11 in the world rankings, feels like a seismic and long-awaited moment for the sport. \"I can't believe I could become world champion in such a short time [after the ban] so I am so proud of myself. \"It was nearly two years playing no competition so my first target was to qualify. Now this will give them [children in China] power and in the future many Chinese players can do this,\" he said while conducting his post-match interviews. Snooker has appeared ready to embrace an Asian champion ever since a shy Ding Junhui defeated seven-time world champion Stephen Hendry to win the 2005 China Open, two days after his 18th birthday. That contest was watched by a reported television audience of 110 million in the country and since then, Ding, who lost the 2016 world final 18-14 to Mark Selby, has long been the flagbearer for Chinese snooker in a period when its popularity has exploded. John Parrott, who won the world title at the Crucible in 1991, said: \"We have been talking about it for years and years. \"Ding has been close and a real ambassador for China, but Zhao being in the final means the viewing figures will be off the charts. Just imagine what it will do for the game over there.\" Chinese players will account for five of the top 16 ranked players in the world at the start of next season Zhao's success is also a fillip for thosewho expect the game to be dominatedby players from the Far East over the coming years, especially given the 'Class of 92' of O'Sullivan, Williams and John Higgins, have reached or are close to, their 50th birthdays. While there is not a formal national curriculum dedicated specifically to snooker in China, the WPBSA is aware of the game being integrated into the school system through academies. \"I've seen first-hand children coming into the building at 09:00 handing in their phones and then spending hours playing snooker, alongside traditional lessons,\" said Matt Huart, the WPBSA head of communications. The World Championship final was available to every TV household in China on CCTV5 and World Snooker expected a potential audience of up to 150 million. China is also snooker's biggest market in the television landscape, making up more than 50% of its global audience. \"A lot of people have spoken about the volume of Chinese players in the later stages but if you turn the clock back 10 years this Tour was predominantly players from England and the other home nations,\" added Ferguson. \"The tide has turned a little bit but you have to remember we are putting events on in cities over there that are half the size of the UK. It is a volume issue around clubs and participation. That means more stars are going to come through. \"Snooker is in schools, it is a mainstream sport. It is something we have to fight in this country [the UK] because you don't see snooker in schools, but you can do athletics, rugby, football and all the other sports. \"In China snooker is seen as being as good as Olympic sports and that is making the difference to talent pathways.\" Zhao Xintong has now won three ranking events",

    "title": "Alexander-Arnold leaves as modern Liverpool great - but fans will feel hurt",
    "article_text": "Trent Alexander-Arnold has won five major trophies with Liverpool Trent Alexander-Arnold's announcement that he is leaving Liverpool at the end of the season confirmed what had seemed an inevitability for months. And even though his next destination was not mentioned in his emotional farewell video, it is an open secret that he will join his friend and England colleague Jude Bellingham at Real Madrid. Alexander-Arnold deserves credit for clarifying his future now. He could have taken the easy way out and left Liverpool supporters hanging until after the Premier League title victory parade around the city on 26 May. Instead, the 26-year-old has made his decision public with two home games left - the first against Arsenal, and the second on the final day against Crystal Palace, when Liverpool will lift the trophy to celebrate their 20th English league title. It will leave him at the mercies of many Liverpool supporters who are baffled that the player they celebrate in song as \"the Scouser in our team\" has decided to leave his boyhood club on a free transfer. Alexander-Arnold's celebration of his late winner at Leicester City in April, when he ripped off his red shirt and hoisted it on a corner flag in front of Liverpool's supporters at the King Power Stadium, prompted faint hope that he might find it impossible to leave the club he has called home for 20 years. The truth hit home when he once more refused to discuss his future during the celebrations of that win. He was leaving Liverpool and no amount of emotional pull on the heartstrings would change his mind. Those emotions will be mixed in the stands and on the pitch when Alexander-Arnold plays his final game at Anfield on 25 May â but his leaving as a title winner might just ease the disappointment, and in some cases anger and bemusement, that many Liverpool followers will be feeling. Liverpool's fans have also have also been questioning the timing of Alexander-Arnold's decision. He leaves with Liverpool on a title high and well placed to challenge for the biggest domestic and European trophies for years to come, while Real Madrid looked like a team in need of renewal when they were thrashed 5-1 by Arsenal over two legs in the Champions League quarter-final. Alexander-Arnold enjoyed a dream return from injury, netting the winner against Leicester in April It will also be a time of churn off the pitch at the Bernabeu, with legendary coach Carlo Ancelotti expected to leave at the end of the season. Why leave the stability and success of Liverpool for a time of transition at Real Madrid? The answer is simple. The lure of Real Madrid is almost always irresistible. In 2023, Bellingham was being courted by every major club in Europe before deciding on Real. As he put it at the time: \"When Real Madrid knock on the door, the whole house shakes.\" The biggest indicator as to where Alexander-Arnold's future lay came when Real Madrid lodged a Â£20m bid in the January transfer window. Those with long knowledge of Real's transfer strategy were assured they would not make such a move, with its likelihood of rejection, without being confident a free transfer would be completed in the summer. Liverpool did turn the offer down, not only wanting to keep Alexander-Arnold but also hoping to buy time for a change of heart. Two months later, he met head coach Arne Slot to inform him he would not be signing a new contract. While there was always a quiet confidence behind the scenes at Anfield that Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk would sign new deals, there was never the same sense of assurance about Alexander-Arnold. This has been, at times, a difficult season for Alexander-Arnold with injuries and the constant speculation - and latterly assumption - that he was on his way out. It all seemed to come to head in the 2-2 draw against Manchester United at Anfield in January. After Real Madrid's bid became public knowledge, Alexander-Arnolddelivered a nightmare performancein what looked like a fog of confusion, playing a poor pass that led to Lisandro Martinez's goal for United before getting caught out badly for Amad Diallo's late equaliser. He was then given a yellow card and replaced by Conor Bradley with four minutes left, having looked lost and distracted throughout, while suddenly feeling the sound of Anfield's frustration aimed in his direction. It is often whistling in the wind to ask fans who feel betrayed, as some Liverpool supporters will, to remember the good times. But in this case it can be justified. Alexander-Arnold has played a pivotal in the good times Liverpool's global fanbase have basked in, first under Jurgen Klopp then in a remarkable first title-winning season under Slot. He has made 352 appearances since making his debut in 2016, scoring 23 goals and claiming all of the game's major prizes. In that time, Liverpool have won 234 of those games. Alexander-Arnold was integral when Liverpool won their first title in 30 years with  Klopp at the helm in 2019-20, having won the Champions League the year before by beating Tottenham Hotspur 2-0 in the final in Madrid. He now has two Premier League titles to his name, along with the FA Cup and two League Cups, as well as the Fifa Club World Cup and Uefa Super Cup. For all the debate around Alexander-Arnold's defensive flaws, these were outweighed by the creative brilliance and stunning range of passing that always gave Liverpool an extra dimension. This is proved by his rate of providing 86 assists in his Anfield career. Alexander-Arnold will be remembered as the local boy who became a modern Liverpool greats. Now he must wait to see if this is fully acknowledged by the supporters who adored him as one of their own wearing the red shirt.

    "title": "Alpine poised to replace Doohan with Colapinto",
    "article_text": "Jack Doohan collided with Liam Lawson on the opening lap of the Miami Grand Prix Alpine are poised to replace Jack Doohan with Franco Colapinto after just six races of the season. The Australian's seat has been at risk since the team signed Colapinto from Williams over the winter. Alpine refused to comment, but insiders say the switch is close to being finalised before the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix at Imola in Italy on 16-18 May. The decision to switch the two drivers comes despite Doohan out-qualifying team-mate Pierre Gasly for the first time this season for the grand prix grid at last weekend's race in Miami. Doohan was also faster in qualifying for the sprint race in China. He retired from the race after a collision with Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson. Doohan has shown strong pace at times but has also had a series of incidents, including two heavy crashes. He lost control in the wet on the first lap of the season-opening Australian Grand Prix, badly damaging his car, and crashed on his second flying lap of practice at the Japanese event two races later. The Suzuka crash came afterDoohan failed to close the DRS overtaking aid before turning into the high-speed Turn One. Colapinto's graduation has been eased by money from Latin American sponsors. The Argentine raced for Williams in nine grands prix last year after the team dropped American Logan Sargeant after the Dutch Grand Prix. Colapinto impressed by scoring points in the Azerbaijan and US races but dented his reputation with heavy crashes at the Sao Paulo Grand Prix - in qualifying and race - and in qualifying at the Las Vegas. He had also crashed in practice in Baku before scoring his breakthrough first points in the race. Alpine signed Colapinto from Williams over the winter, leading to immediate speculation that he would eventually replace Doohan. Williams team principal James Vowles has made it clear the team have the option to take him back in the future. Doohan is expected to stay involved with Alpine.",

    "title": "Sinner doping ban deal 'best choice in bad moment'",
    "article_text": "Jannik Sinner is the reigning Australian Open and US Open champion Jannik Sinner says it was \"good news\" for him personally not to miss any Grand Slam tournaments during his three-month doping ban. World number one Sinner accepted the ban in February after reaching a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) over histwo positive testslast year. His ban expired at midnight on Sunday, meaning he is able to compete at his home tournament - the Italian Open - in Rome this week. âOf course when you go to court it can go both ways - nothing or a lot,â the 23-year-old told a packed interview room at the Foro Italico. âI didn't want to do it [agree a settlement] in the beginning, so it was not easy for me to accept it because I know what really happened. âBut sometimes we have to choose the best in a very bad moment, and that's what we did. \"For me personally it's good news that there are not the Grand Slams included.\" Sinner has a first-round bye in Rome and will play either Argentinaâs world number 99 Mariano Navone or 18-year-old Italian wildcard Federico Cina on Saturday. Still number one & 'sparring' with Draper - return of Sinner How Draper has become a force on clay - Second Serve Sabalenka beats spirited Gauff to win Madrid Open Sinner had previously been cleared of any wrongdoing by an independent panel after testing positive for the banned substance clostebol in March 2024. Wada lodged an appeal against that decision with the Court of Arbitration for Sport, saying at the time it was seeking a \"period of ineligibility of between one and two years.\" Wada ultimately entered into negotiations with Sinner's legal team having come to the conclusion a ban of that length would constitute an \"unduly harsh sanction.\" Some players have been critical of the length and timing of Sinner's ban. Three-time Grand Slam champion Stan Wawrinka posted he does not \"believe in a clean sport any more\" while 2022 Wimbledon runner-up Nick Kyrgios said fairness in tennis \"does not exist\". Sinnerâs news conference took place just after he had arrived on site for the first time, allowing for little interaction with other players. His answers instead focused on the Italian Open, which he considers a \"very low expectation tournament\". He also would not be drawn on if he was surprised neither Alexander Zverev or Carlos Alcarazhad overtaken himat the top of the world rankings in his absence. \"I am happy in the position I am but I would be happy even if I'm three or four in the world,\" Sinner said. \"I'm just happy to be back here - I'm happy to play again in front of the fans, and I have a goal in front of my eyes.\" Sinner says he did not watch any of the Masters 1000 events in Miami and Indian Wells in March, but was studying some of his rivals during recent TV coverage of the Madrid Open. Sinner could start 'official training activity' from 13 April and had some practice sessions with Britain's Jack Draper on the Monte Carlo clay to keep his eye in. During his ban, Sinner was unable to watch other professional sport in person. A banned athlete may not \"participate in any capacity\" at an event subject to the Wada code. \"The toughest part was that in the beginning I couldn't watch any other sport really, in real life,\" Sinner added. \"I don't know how many know this but watching a simple football match in a stadium, I couldn't go there to watch it. \"I wanted to support my friends in cycling or motorsport - I couldn't go there.\" The Italian Open is one of the big clay-court tournaments before the French Open takes place from 25 May-8 June.",

    "title": "'We need to take a look at ourselves' - Arsenal stalling at wrong time",
    "article_text": "Arsenal have shipped nine goals in their past two WSL games after conceding 14 in their previous 19 outings Arsenal know better than most what a difference a week can make. Seven days ago Renee Slegers' side were basking in the glow of a remarkable 4-1 away victory over Lyon that sent them to a first Women's Champions League final in 18 years. Fast forward to Monday and Arsenal are investigating exactly how they lost 5-2 and 4-2 to Aston Villa and Brighton respectively in back-to-back league games. While the defeat at Villa Park was unexpected, it was perhaps somewhat understandable. Slegers made seven changes from the team that beat Lyon, and the result was a shaky and disjointed performance. Worringly, the side thatcollapsed against Brightonwas similar to the one that conquered one of Europe's great teams. \"We wanted to bounce back and turn that game around, and the same thing has happened to us again,\" Arsenal's Caitlin Foord told Sky Sports. \"It's not good enough all round and we need to take a look at ourselves individually and as a team. We can't let that happen again this weekend.\" While Fran Kirby and Jelena Cankovic both scored stunners for the hosts, Brighton's third and fourth goals came directly from defensive lapses. Arsenal have shipped nine goals in their past two WSL games after conceding 14 in their previous 19 outings. While they forced Brighton goalkeeper Sophie Baggaley into 10 saves, they couldn't recover. \"In the last two WSL games we conceded nine goals in and we said as a team we don't think it's acceptable,\" Slegers added. \"We of course don't want this to happen. There are different reasons. The Villa game was different. We came from something else and the goals we conceded were different. \"We need to learn two very tough lessons coming off a big success. We have to learn. It's part of being a top team. This can't happen to us, so we have to find solutions and move forward.\" Back-to-back league defeats for the first time since May 2023 begs the question: have Arsenal's players been distracted by their Champions League achievement? \"Of course it's intense for the players with where we came from and what's ahead of us,\" said Slegers. \"We have to be in the moment. That is the million dollar question. We have to analyse and I will be working until late tonight and tomorrow. \"We want to try and get the details right and put our finger on what it is and how we want to move forward.\" Foord was more direct when answering the question. \"I don't think so. That's in the back of our mind and that is the game we are playing for this season,\" she said. \"But we have a job to do before that as well. We could have done that today and we haven't. Now it comes down to Saturday and our last game to prepare for the Champions League.\" Victory would have wrapped up second place in the WSL, but now it's up for grabs when Arsenal face third-placed Manchester United on Saturday. A third straight league defeat for the first time in a decade would see the Gunners slip to third, meaning they would enter next season's Champions League in the second qualifying round rather than the third. That's unless Arsenal beat Barcelona in this season's final, in which case they would secure a place in next season's new league phase. \"[We need] a good performance, we need to play well, we need to get that confidence back,\" said Foord. \"We need to take our chances and everyone has to be back into the game, as we were against Lyon, if we want to go on to do well in the Champions League.\" Head here to get involved Get the latest WSL news on our dedicated page Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "Sudan fails in attempt to make UAE accountable for acts of genocide",
    "article_text": "An attempt by Sudan’s government to make theUnited Arab Emirateslegally accountable for acts of genocide in West Darfur has been rejected by the international court of justice after the judges voted by 14 to 2 to declare they had no jurisdiction. By a narrower majority the judges voted 9 to 7 to strike the case entirely from the ICJ list. There have been repeated allegations during the two-year civil war inSudanthat the UAE has been flying arms to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in an attempt to oust the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) led by Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. However, when the UAE signed up to article IX of the genocide convention in 2005, it inserted a reservation stating it would not allow disputes about the interpretation, application and fulfilment of the convention to be resolved at the ICJ. The ICJ ,president, Yuji Iwasawa, acknowledged that Sudanese government lawyers in presenting their case claimed that the RSF had engaged in “extrajudicial killing, ethnic cleansing, rape, enforced disappearances and burning of villages as well as killing on an ethnic basis”. The court was “deeply concerned about [how] the unfolding conflict led to untold loss of life and suffering in west Darfur”. But, the president said, the UAE reservation had been formulated in clear terms, and was not incompatible with the purpose of the genocide convention. The judges’ ruling was largely expected but marks a second diplomatic victory in the UAE efforts to ward off allegations that it has been prolonging the bloody two-year civil war by arming the RSF. A UN panel of experts report on 29 April published no evidence that the UAE was arming the RSF. Speaking after the ICJ ruling in The Hague, , deputy assistant minister for political affairs at the UAE ministry of foreign affairs said: “Quite simply, today’s decision represents a resounding rejection of the Sudanese Armed Forces’ attempt to instrumentalise the court for its campaign of misinformation and to distract from its own responsibility.“The facts speak for themselves: the UAE bears no responsibility for the conflict in Sudan. On the contrary, the atrocities committed by the warring parties are well documented.“The international community must focus urgently on ending this devastating war and supporting the Sudanese people, and it must demand humanitarian aid reaches all those in need. The Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces must stop fighting, must stop weaponising aid, and must endorse civilian leadership independent from military control as the only foundation for sustainable peace.” The ICJ ruling that it had no jurisdiction is controversial for some. A group of prestigious international jurists last week backed a legal opinion from the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights that argued: “While some narrowly tailored reservations to article IX of the genocide convention might be permissible, blanket reservations to the entirety of article IX should be rejected as invalid.” They argued “the utility of the genocide convention is not for states to adopt these principles in the abstract, which exist with or without the convention, but to bind states to comply with its terms. “To allow states to exempt themselves from the genocide convention’s only judicial mechanism not only undermines the integrity of the convention, but also the efficacy, foreseeability, and reliability of the international system as a whole.” Currently 153 states are party to the genocide convention, with 16 states inserting blanket reservations including the UAE. The UK has been one of a group of influential states that have argued such broad reservations may be incompatible with the convention. In its opinion, the Wallenberg Centre concluded: “The current expectation that the court bend to the will of outlier reserving states seeking to evade participation in cases as significant as genocide should be reversed. In 2025, these states should not have the final word before the judicial process even begins. They should be compelled to account for their actions in a court of law.”",

    "title": "Dossier of alleged Sudan war crimes handed to Metropolitan police",
    "article_text": "Scotland Yard has received a dossier of evidence documenting myriad alleged war crimes committed by a paramilitary group during the conflict inSudan. Lawyers have submitted a 142-page file of evidence to thewar crimes unitof the Metropolitan police containing details of numerous atrocities perpetrated by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Compiled by a London-based team of barristers specialising in international law, it documents killings, torture and mass rape. It has been drawn up to support global efforts to hold perpetrators accountable and the lawyers have requested that the Met unit – part of the force’s counter-terrorism command known as SO15 – reviews the dossier before passing it to the international criminal court (ICC) to assistinvestigations into RSF atrocities in Darfur, in the west of Sudan. Now into its third year, thecatastrophic warbetween the RSF and the Sudanese military has prompted the world’s biggest humanitarian crisis, killed at least 150,00 people and forced 12 million from their homes. The lawyers said the documents, given to the Met on Monday, offer evidence that the RSF’s leadership are responsible for repeated war crimes, focusing on the legal principle of “command responsibility” – that commanders knew or ought to have known about the atrocities committed by their troops. Former international judgeSir Howard Morrisondescribed the dossier’s weight of evidence as “compelling”. “The novel approach through the highly regarded offices of SO15 adds great impetus to the potential accountability of those responsible for the atrocities that have been visited upon numerousvictims in Darfur,” Morrison said. The lead lawyer, Lucia Brieskova, added: “We believe this submission will contribute to the fight against impunity suffered by many inDarfurin Sudan.” The case was instructed by a Sudanese pro-democracy supporter, whom the Guardian is not naming for security reasons. It comes as the international court of justice is expected to deliver a verdict on whether the United Arab Emirates can plausibly be found “complicit in the commission of genocide” by arming the RSF in Sudan’s civil war. The case was brought by Sudan who said the UAE has been arming the RSF with the aim ofwiping out the non-Arab Masalit populationof west Darfur. The UAE has said the case is a cynical publicity stunt. Recently the Trump administration characterised atrocities committed by the RSF in Darfur as genocide,reaffirming a designationmade by the Biden administration in January. The submission sent to Scotland Yard says evidence assembled by the UN, human rights groups and the media, proved war crimes in Darfur were perpetrated by RSF troops. “Steps should have been taken by the RSF leadership to address the situation. “Taken together, this direct and circumstantial evidence makes it clear that the RSF leadership either knew, or at least should have known, that the war crimes were being committed by the RSF in Darfur. Therefore, they have a case to answer under international criminal and humanitarian law,” it states. Although the ICC investigation is focusing on war crimes in Darfur, reports of atrocities being committed throughout the country continue to emerge. Last week, footage circulated online showed at least 31 people, including children, were killed by the RSF in Khartoum’s twin city of Omdurman. The Sudanese army also faces accusations of committing atrocities against civilians, with its leaders sanctioned by the US.",

    "article_text": "Peru’s president, Dina Boluarte, has suspended goldminingand announced a 12-hour curfew in Pataz, in the northern region, after criminals kidnapped and killed 13 gold mine workers. A Peruvian gold mining company La Poderosa said on Sunday that the bodies of 13 contract workers from a local firm had been found by police inside one of the mine’s tunnels. Boluarte told journalists on Monday that the “armed forces will take control of the area where La Poderosa operates”, but did not give further details about how the 30-day mining pause would be enforced. The government response, which critics have called tardy and ineffective, comes amid outrage over the murder of the 13 men who had been held captive for more than a week by criminals believed linked to illegal mining. Police said the hostages were tortured and that video footage – allegedly recorded by the captors themselves – showed the miners were shot dead at point-blank range. Illegal gold mining has surged in Peru, Latin America’s biggest producer of the precious metal, just as the international price peaked once more at around $3,500 per ounce. Meanwhile acrime wave has swept the countrywith unprecedented rises in racketeering and killing-for-hire. 2024 saw a record increase murder rates – a 35.9%increase in homicidescompared with 2023. “Illegal mining is the most lucrative criminal activity in the country,” said César Ipenza, an environmental lawyer. Illegal gold mining accounted for $9bn , or 60% of Peru’s total laundered assets betweenJanuary 2014 and October 2024, according to the country’s Financial Intelligence Unit, dwarfing the next biggest sources of laundered assets. Once confined to certain zones illegal gold mining has spread throughout the country since the Covid-19 pandemic. The gold-rich area where the mine is located in La Libertad region has been under a state of emergency for more than two years due to ongoing violence and unrest. This massacre brings to 39 the number of artisanal miners and workers killed by criminal gangs in Pataz, the company La PoderosaMiningconfirmed in a statement. “The spiral of uncontrolled violence in Pataz is occurring despite the declaration of a state of emergency and the presence of a large police contingent which, unfortunately, has not been able to halt the deterioration of security conditions in the area,” the statement added. In December, thousands of gold miners camped out in the downtown Lima and blocked the main highway to insist that the government maintain a registry of informal and illegal miners known as REINFO which protects them from prosecution.",

    "article_text": "A frantic search for two children presumed lost in the unforgiving and thickly forested lands of Nova Scotia has entered its fourth day as police in AtlanticCanadaexpand their search. Nearly 150 searchers have braved rain and fog to track down Lily Sullivan, six, and Jack Sullivan, four, who were last seen on Friday around their home in Pictou county, 100 miles north-east of Halifax. Their mother Malehya Brooks-Murray and stepfather, Daniel Martell, have told local media they were sleeping with their 16-month-old baby on Friday morning as the older children played in the house. But when they awoke later in the morning, the two children were gone. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police believe the pair, members of the Mi’kmaq First Nation community of Sipekne’katik, wandered off from their home and probably entered a heavily forested area. Among the resources devoted to the effort have been dog teams with the heavy urban search and rescue team from Halifax, the region’s largest city, as well as thermal imaging cameras attached to drones. Police say their work has been “strategic and thorough” as they weigh any clues that might suggest a likely whereabouts for the children. The search is also the first major undertaking by the Nova Scotia Guard, a newly formed a volunteer emergency organization meant to address shortfalls in the province’s response to crisis. In 2023,a flash flood killed four people, including three children – a tragedy that some residents believe could have been avoided by timely warnings sent by authorities. Nova Scotia’s premier,Tim Houston, a resident of Pictou county, has visited the search headquarters alongside other local officials, to offer support for residents and searchers. “People in Pictou County and across Nova Scotia are praying for a positive outcome for two missing children,” he said in a statement. “During this time of worry, please know that our first responders and volunteers are working tirelessly during this 24/7 operation.” Foiled at times by inclement weather, more than a dozen search teams are in the field. “Everybody in the community is concerned and worried, but we’re all hoping for the best here,” said Donald Parker, a municipal councillor with the municipality of Pictou county told CBC News. “It’s hard on the whole community … It’s incredibly tough.” On social media, the Sipekne’katik chief, Michelle Glasgow, questioned the decision not to issue an Amber alert, used when a child is presumed abducted, and said the disappearance underscored the need for a national alerting system. “Please help bring Jack and Lily home,” she wrote.",

    "title": "Mexico’s president tries to defuse fears of US military intervention",
    "article_text": "A sharp exchange of statements over the weekend has heightened concerns inMexicothat Donald Trump may push for a US military presence in its territory to fight drug trafficking. The Mexican president,Claudia Sheinbaum, sought to defuse the situation in her daily press conference on Monday, emphasising that communication between the two leaders had been “very good” so far. But the episode underlinedthe fraught path that Sheinbaum is navigating, as she attempts to placate Trump and protect the US-Mexico trade relationship while also defending Mexican sovereignty. On Saturday, Sheinbaum revealed she had rejected an offer from Trump during a call last week to send US troops intoMexicoto help fight drug trafficking. “I told him, ‘No, President Trump, our territory is inviolable, our sovereignty is inviolable,’” said Sheinbaum, adding that while the two countries can collaborate, “we will never accept the presence of the US army in our territory”. Trump on Sunday confirmed he had made the offer to Sheinbaum, because the cartels “are horrible people that have been killing people left and right and have been – they’ve made a fortune on selling drugs and destroying our people”. “The president of Mexico is a lovely woman, but she is so afraid of the cartels that she can’t even think straight,” added Trump. Despite the exchange over the weekend, the public relationship between Trump and Sheinbaum has been largely cordial, with manycomparing Sheinbaum’s performance favourablyagainst other world leaders who have clashed with the US president. The US-Mexico relationship is complex and vastly important for both countries, spanning trade, migration and security. Since returning to power in January, Trump has imposed various tariff schemes that have jeopardised the free trade agreement between the two countries and the near trillion dollars of trade a year that passes between them. Trump directly linked some of those tariffs to reducing the movement of undocumented migrants and fentanyl across the border into the US, and Sheinbaum’s cabinet has been engaged in intense diplomatic efforts to persuade him to withdraw them. Sheinbaum first sent 10,000 additional troops to the border, then Mexico sent 29high-level organised crime operativesto face justice in the US, including Rafael Caro Quintero, the drug lord who was convicted of the murder of an undercover US Drug Enforcement Administration agent in 1985. Meanwhile Sheinbaum has abandoned the hands-off security strategy of her predecessor and ally, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, and ramped up direct confrontation of organised crime groups, withsoaring arrests and seizuresof drugs and guns. “Trump has created a real pressure that’s forced Mexico to act,” said Will Freeman from the Council on Foreign Relations, a US-based thinktank. “I think Sheinbaum wants to act anyway, but it’s made her job easier by putting this pressure behind her. “I think Trump’s vision is that this is almost like an insurgency in Mexico,” added Freeman. “And if the Mexican military is not willing to fight it – and they do often seem to be less than willing to use their full force against the cartels – then the US should do it.” But experts say it is unclear that greater military action would fundamentally address the problem of organised crime in Mexico. “I think to really change the balance of power between organised crime and the state in Mexico, you need intelligence, you need accountability through the justice system, you need political will,” said Freeman. Still, Trump has said that the US could use unilateral military action if Mexico does not do enough to dismantle the cartels. Sheinbaum has warned that her countrywould not toleratean “invasion” of its national sovereignty by US forces. “But the Mexican government should not just assume that [unilateral military action] couldn’t happen, regardless of how bad an idea it would be on many levels,” said Cecilia Farfán-Méndez, from the Global Initiative against Transnational Organised Crime, an NGO. “All scenarios should be planned for.”",

    "title": "Two arrested over bomb plot targeting Lady Gaga concert in Rio attended by millions",
    "article_text": "Two people have been arrested in connection with an alleged plot to detonate explosives at a free Lady Gaga concert inRio de Janeiro, in what authorities believe was an attempt to target Brazil’s LGBTQ community. The Rio event on Saturdaywas the biggest show of the pop star’s career. It attracted an estimated 2.1 million fans to Copacabana beach and had crowds screaming and dancing along. “They were clearly saying that they were planning an attack at Lady Gaga’s concert motivated by sexual orientation,” Felipe Cury, secretary of the Rio police, told a press conference on Sunday. The Rio police chief, Luiz Lima, said the group disseminated hate speech and violent content online “aimed at gaining notoriety in order to attract more viewers, more participants – most of them teenagers, many of them children”. Even as Brazilian authorities said they arrested suspects in the hours before Lady Gaga’s show, the event went ahead without disruption – leading some to question the seriousness of the threat. Serious security concerns typically lead organisers to cancel such massive events – as happened with Taylor Swift’s concerts in Vienna last year. Police said nothing about the alleged plot at the time in an effort to “avoid panic” and “the distortion of information”. A spokesperson for Lady Gaga said the pop star and her team “learned about this alleged threat via media reports this morning. Prior to and during the show, there were no known safety concerns, nor any communication from the police or authorities to Lady Gaga regarding any potential risks.” The statement added: “Her team worked closely with law enforcement throughout the planning and execution of the concert and all parties were confident in the safety measures in place.” Security was tight at Saturday’s concert, with 5,200 military and police officers deployed to the beach where fans were revelling in the pop singer’s classic hits including Born This Way, which became an LGBTQ anthem after its 2011 release. Authorities arrested two people in connection with the alleged plot – a man described as the group’s leader in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul on illegal weapons possession charges, and a teenager in Rio on child sexual abuse charges. Police did not elaborate on their exact roles in the plot or on how the group came to target Lady Gaga’s free concert. “Those involved were recruiting participants, including teenagers, to carry out integrated attacks using improvised explosives and molotov cocktails,” police said. The Justice Ministry said it determined the group posed a “risk to public order”. It said the group falsely presented themselves online as Little Monsters – Lady Gaga’s nickname for her fans – in order to lure teeangers into “networks with violent and self-destructive content”. During a series of raids on the homes of 15 suspects across several Brazilian states, authorities confiscated phones and other electronic devices. Although police said they believed homemade bombs were intended for use in the planned attack, there was no mention of the raids turning up any weapons or explosive material. Cury said one of the suspects whose home was raided in the city of Macaé, near Rio, “had a religious motivation” and “claimed [Lady Gaga] was a Satanist”. In an Instagram post, Lady Gaga has expressed gratitude for the enormous crowd. “Nothing could prepare me for the feeling I had during last night’s show – the absolute pride and joy I felt singing for the people of Brazil,” she wrote. “The sight of the crowd during my opening songs took my breath away. Your heart shines so bright, your culture is so vibrant and special, I hope you know how grateful I am to have shared this historical moment with you.” Her free beach concert stood out at a time of surging ticket prices for live music around the world as concertgoers pay budget-busting costs to see their favourite artists. Last month Lady Gagaperformed at Coachella Valley music festivalin California, where tickets fetched upwards of $600 for one weekend.The high prices of tickets for her upcoming shows in Australia have also attracted criticismlocally. Last May, superstar Madonna also performed on Copacabana beach, playing the final show of her latest world tower for some 1.6 million fans on the sprawling sands.",

    "article_text": "Human rights groups have condemned the arrest of relatives of Anna Kwok, an exiled pro-democracy activist who is wanted by the Hong Kong police, in the first example of the city’snational security lawbeing used to target the family members of an activist living overseas. Kwok, 28, is the executive director of the Washington-based Hong Kong Democracy Council, and is one of 19 overseas activists wanted by the national security police, who are offeringbountiesof HK$1m (£97,000) for information leading to arrest. Kwok’s father, 68, and her brother, 35, were arrested on 30 April on suspicion of “attempting to deal with directly or indirectly, any funds or other financial assets or economic resources belonging to, or owned or controlled by, a relevant absconder”. The police said the men were suspected of helping Kwok to change the details of a life insurance policy and withdraw its remaining value. Kwok’s father was charged and detained while her brother was released on bail pending further investigations. Yalkun Uluyol, China researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: “The Chinese government has increased its appalling use of collective punishment against family members of peaceful activists fromHong Kong. The Hong Kong authorities should immediately and unconditionally release Anna Kwok’s father and cease harassing families of Hong Kong activists.” ChinaAid, a US-based human rights group, said: “This represents a deeply unsettling and significant escalation of the ongoing retaliatory actions against the families of exiled activists … this is a blatant attempt to silence overseas dissidents by targeting their family members at home, a tactic that brazenly disregards fundamental human rights and the rule of law.” Police in Hong Kong have repeatedlyquestioned the relativesof exiled activists. In recent months relatives of Tony Chung, Frances Hui and Carmen Lau, overseas pro-democracy activists who are alsowanted by the Hong Kong police, have been questioned. Chung and Lau, who are in the UK, have both had threatening letters sent to their neighbours offering rewards for information leading to their capture. The arrests in Kwok’s case mark the first time that relatives have been criminally charged. Kwok’s father faces a sentence of up to seven years in prison if convicted. He has been denied bail with the case adjourned to 13 June, according to Reuters. The Hong Kong police and the Hong Kong Democracy Council did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Kwok could not be reached for comment.",

    "title": "Huge swings to Labor from Chinese Australian voters in key seats show Liberals failed to rebuild trust, experts say",
    "article_text": "Suburbs with significant Chinese Australian populations in key marginal seats recorded huge swings to Labor of up to 30%, and strategists and analysts warn theLiberal partyhas failed to rebuild trust with the community. The Liberal party’sreview of the 2022 federal electionfound hawkish rhetoric on China cost it votes in several seats with high numbers of Chinese Australians. It called for greater community outreach and to rebuild trust before the 2025 poll. Those efforts,including increased engagment on Chinese social media, appear to have failed. Labor recorded swings towards it in the Melbourne seats of Menzies, Aston and Chisholm, and the Sydney seats of Bennelong and Reid. In all these marginal seats, between 13% and 30% of constituents have Chinese ancestry. Polling booths in Chatswood and Eastwood – two suburbs in Bennelong where more than 40% of people have Chinese ancestry – recorded swings to Labor of between 15% and 26%. Labor’s Jerome Laxale boosted his wafer-thin margin of 0.1% in Bennelong to almost 10%, with 77% of the vote counted so far. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email A senior New South Wales Labor source said the party’s strategy in Bennelong, Reid and Parramatta was focused on undermining the Liberal party’s efforts to restore trust with the Chinese Australian community. One strategist, who requested anonymity to speak freely, said Dutton’s previous comments had made this relatively easy, including hisclaims that Labor was “weak” on China. “[The Liberal party] had good candidates in Reid and Bennelong,” the Labor strategist said. “Two young people of Asian heritage [Grange Chung and Scott Yung] who on paper would have been quite compelling. So we made our strategy to link their candidates to Peter Dutton as often as possible. “If you were at those polling stations on election day, all the material you would have seen from us was ‘Vote Yung, get Dutton’ with oversized images of their faces on corflutes. We were successful in that.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email When asked on Sunday what mattered most to his constituents in Bennelong, Laxale said “Peter Dutton”. In Menzies, every polling both with a double-digit swing to Labor had a significant amount of voters with Chinese ancestry. The same trend was replicated across neighbouring Chisholm. In Box Hill, where 46% of people have Chinese ancestry, Labor had so far won 71% of votes. A senior Victorian Labor source said “virtually no resources” went into Menzies and that there was no field organiser on the ground. They said the campaign capitalised on statements from Dutton that appeared hawkish on China. “When inthe final debatePeter Dutton said China was the biggest threat to national security we couldn’t believe it. It all got packaged up for RedBook and WeChat right away,” the Labor source said. “It was yet another huge own goal in a campaign full of them.” Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion When the Liberal senator Jane Hume claimed some Chinese Australians handing out how-to-vote cards for Labor may have been “communist spies”, the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong,recorded WeChat videoshammering the Liberals and speaking in Mandarin. The NSW strategist said the Liberals’ decision to preference One Nation in seats across the country was not, on its own, “a vote shifter”. He suggested it instead “reinforced a view among the Chinese community that Dutton was anti-China and racist” – and that the same applied for Hume’s comments. Wilfred Wang, an academic with Chinese ancestry researching Chinese migrant media at the University of Melbourne, lives and votes in Aston and worked in a polling booth during the Saturday election. He also counted votes for a Chisholm outpost centre in the 2022 election. He said the voting intentions of Chinese Australians are not as simplistic as they are often portrayed in the media. “I suspect many Chinese Australians felt the Coalition was not inclusive enough,” Wang said. “This is very different from the mainstream discourse around ‘pro- or anti-China’: this binary is misleading and misinterprets the community’s sentiment. “When the Liberal party played up the ‘Chinese spy’ rhetoric and also their very hard rhetoric around ‘immigration’, it made many Chinese voters feel excluded from the so-called mainstream society in Australia and that their contributions to our society have not been properly recognised, let alone celebrated.” Eric Fu, a senior research fellow at the University of Melbourne who focuses on citizenship, said “many in the Chinese community felt isolated and targeted by the Liberals on several occasions during the campaign”. “Their loyalty to Australian democracy was questioned and smeared publicly on TV.”",

    "title": "‘Far worse than Morrison’: where did the Coalition lose the election?",
    "article_text": "Peter Dutton’s target demographic – mortgage-saddled middle-aged or older Australians, who he tried to court with a fuel cut and tax offset – are among those who abandoned the Coalition at the election, pollsters say. The Liberal party, at this stage, has eight seats to its name that can be defined as urban, and it’s likely its next leader will hold a regional seat – the purview of its sister party, the Nationals. Pollsters have attributed Labor’s victory to an increase in support from women, younger Australians and some culturally and linguistically diverse communities. Redbridge director Kos Samaras said middle-aged Australians in general also abandoned the Coalition. “The votes that the Coalition lost over an eight-week period, where we saw the Liberal primary [vote] collapse by about 9%, were mainly people in their 40s and 50s who rent or still have a mortgage, and live in the outer suburbs and regions.” Experts had warned the vote of gen Z and millennials – those born between 1981 and 2010 – were increasing the progressive vote and were moving away from the major parties. But on two-party preferred votes, those generations, which now outnumber the baby boomers, overwhelmingly supported Labor over the Coalition – on a scale of 60 to 40. “Amongst gen Z and millennials, the Labor primary is easily around 60% two-party-preferred, consistent across all electorates, including regional Australia,” Samaras said. He said women were particularly turned off by the Coalition, and rejected leader Peter Dutton more than former prime minister Scott Morrison. “The gender split is the biggest I have ever seen, far worse than Morrison,” Samaras said. “On two-party-preferred, Labor’s vote amongst women was 55 versus the Coalition’s 45, in the electorates we were tracking, and that’s amongst areas that we were tracking. That’s outer suburban and regional electorates only.” Prof Nicholas Biddle, head of the School of Politics and International Relations at the Australian National University, said the “signs were already there”. “My read of it is that the scale of those shifts were greater than we thought, but the directions were all starting to emerge even late last year and early this year.” Biddle said his research found age, cultural background and gender were all key factors, but also added that education and housing tenure had an impact. “Where there has been shifts, it would appear that it’s in areas with relatively high levels of education, and that’s been emerging over a little while, and really it appears the scale has accelerated.” As Coalition support dropped, Biddle said that not all of that, as some had predicted, went out to the minor parties and independents. Labor was able to increase its primary vote across the country, Biddle said. Earlier this year, the shift of support for the Coalition didn’t equate to an increase in votes for Labor – but that changed when Australians cast their votes. “What appears to have occurred is those shifts have gone not just in second and third preferences but even first preferences to Labor,” Biddle said. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email “It’s not just a Coalition loss – it’s easy to look at Dutton losing his seat, and the emergence or salience of Donald Trump – but it appears that it is an improvement in support for the Labor party.” Results in Tasmania showed more regional areas left the Coalition for Labor. In Queenstown, in the seat of Braddon, Labor recorded a primary vote of 44% and a swing of more than 20%. Almost a fifth of workers in the area are trades workers and technicians, the kind of voters the Coalition was trying to hold on to. Samaras said voters who spoke a language other than English at home also backed the Labor party over the Coalition. “That’s such a big one, so the two-party-preferred for Labor amongst Australians who speak another language at home is 60% across all our research,” he said. “And of course that is a drastic problem for a party that was trying to win seats in two swing states of NSW and Victoria.” Samaras said it was particularly the Indian and Chinese diaspora who supported Labor. “This is why they lost Deakin and Menzies [in Victoria].”",

    "title": "Ex-French interior minister apologises to Liverpool fans for making them a ‘scapegoat’",
    "article_text": "The former French interior minister has apologised to Liverpool fans for using them as a “scapegoat” for thechaos surrounding the 2022 Champions League finalin Paris, where supporters of the club, including children, were teargassed by police amid false claims they had caused a riot. Gérald Darmanin, who is now France’s justice minister, called the night “the biggest failure” of his career. On 28 May 2022,Liverpoolsupporters said they feared for their lives as they were forced to enter Stade de France via a narrow subway and boxed-in lanes that could not accommodate the thousands of people that had arrived. This led to severe overcrowding which a French senate report later said posed “a risk of crushing”. Security and ticket checks were abandoned. This led to people without tickets, including some local young men who attacked Liverpool fans, to gain entry into the stadium. Shortly before kick-off, the turnstiles were closed, leaving many fans with tickets unable to get inside the stadium. As more people arrived, police used pepper spray and teargas on the crowd. After the match, Liverpool supporters complained of being robbed by local gangs and said police had offered no protection. The French government, police and Uefa placedthe blame on Liverpool supporters, claiming that the chaos was caused by thousands seeking entry with fake tickets. Darmanin apologised to Liverpool fans for the first time on Monday.Speakingto the LEGEND YouTube channel, he said: “It was a failure because I had not foreseen. That was a mistake on my part. I was led astray by my preconceptions. “The scapegoat was easy to find, and I apologise now to Liverpool supporters. They were quite right to be hurt. It was a mistake and a failure.” After the match, Darmanin made a statement saying the chaos had been caused by “30,000-40,000 Liverpool fans” with forged or no tickets and alleged there had been an “industrial scale” ticket fraud. Ian Byrne, the MP for Liverpool West Derby, told the Guardian: “Darmanin’s conduct afterPariswas unforgivable and I questioned his fitness in being a minister responsible for justice at the time. “He repeated all the lies about hooliganism, fake tickets to frame the blame on the Liverpool supporters who were once again victims of a state cover-up. It was only because of the collective fightback of Liverpool supporters and fine journalism that prevented the narrative Darmanin was spinning gaining traction. “The partial apology will be noted by Liverpool supporters but Darmanin’s actions will not be forgiven or forgotten.” A month after the game, Darmanin, apologised to “everyone who suffered from bad management” but stopped short of saying sorry to the Liverpool fans. “Should the Stade deFrancehave been better managed? The answer is yes,” he told the French radio station RTL at the time. “Am I partly responsible? The answer is yes. Of course, I readily apologise towards everyone who suffered from this bad management of the event.” AGuardian investigation in the aftermath of the gamedetailed the near disaster Liverpool fans faced, including reporting that children were among those pepper sprayed unprovoked by police. In March, a judge ruled that Liverpool fans affected by the game had the right to have their personal injury claims heard in the UK after an attempt by European football’s governing body to block it.",

    "title": "Romania’s pro-EU prime minister resigns as Trump ally eyes presidency",
    "article_text": "Romania’s pro-EU prime minister, Marcel Ciolacu, has resigned after his ruling coalition’s candidate crashed out of a presidential election rerundecisively won by a far-right Trump admirer, dramatically deepening the country’s political turmoil. “Rather than let the future president replace me, I decided to resign myself,” Ciolacu, told reporters after a meeting at the headquarters of his Social Democratic party (PSD). “The ruling coalition has no legitimacy, at least in this formula.” Ciolacu said the PSD would withdraw from the pro-western coalition – effectively ending it – while cabinet ministers will stay on in an interim capacity until a new majority can be negotiated after the presidential run-off on 18 May. Sunday’s first-round vote was convincingly won by ultranationalist George Simion, 38, who sports Maga caps, pushes a socially conservative agenda and has called for the “Melonisation” – referring to Italy’s far-right prime minister – ofEurope. Simion’s score of 40.96% was almost double that of the second-placed finisher, the Bucharest mayor Nicușor Dan. The two will face each other in a runoff that raises the prospect of another disruptive nationalist joining the EU leaders’ club. The coalition candidate, Crin Antonescu, finished third in a bitter blow to the government, formed after December elections by the leftist PSD, the centrist Liberals and ethnic Hungarian UDMR to keep the EU andNatomember on a pro-western track. Simion’s Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) and two other sovereignist parties won more than a third of parliamentary seats, and forming a new majority without the far-right bloc will be hard – even more so if Simion is elected president. A Simion victory – and a likely change of government – could lead to Romania, which shares a border withUkraine, veering away from the mainstream and becoming another disruptive force within the EU alongside Hungary and Slovakia. It would also be welcomed by conservative nationalists in Europe and beyond – including senior Trump administration figures such as the US vice-president, JD Vance – who accused Bucharest of denying democracy after the original ballot was cancelled. “The problem now isn’t that Romania is in a hard place, but that the EU is, should George Simion win,” said the political scientist Cristian Pîrvulescu. “The anti-European group within the EU will become more substantial.” The French far-right leader Marine Le Pen said Romania’s voters had sent “a very nice boomerang” to the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, echoing claims Brussels was behind the cancellation of the original vote last year. Simion said after the result that his win was “not just an electoral victory, it is a victory of Romanian dignity. It is the victory of those who have not lost hope, of those who still believe in Romania, a free, respected, sovereign country.” The far-right candidate added: “I am here to serve Romanians, not the other way around. He said he believed in an EU “that thrives as a nest for its diverse and sovereign nations – not as a rigid system enforcing one-size-fits-all policies”. Simion, whose AUR has grown from an anti-vax movement into the country’s second-largest party, finished first in 36 of 47 electoral districts and secured 61% of the large overseas vote. Dan, a 55-year-old mathematician who founded the Save Romania Union party (USR) and campaigned as a pro-EU, anti-corruption independent, called the runoff a battle “to convince Romanians that Romania needs its pro-western direction”. Sign up toHeadlines Europe A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day after newsletter promotion He said the two weeks leading up to the runoff would be “difficult against this isolationist candidate … It will not be a debate between individuals, it will be a debate between a pro-western direction for Romania and an anti-western direction”. Experts have said Dan may struggle to beat Simion in the runoff because of disagreements between the independent candidate and the mainstream PSD and Liberal parties that could easily deter their voters from switching allegiance. Romania’s president has a semi-executive role with considerable powers over foreign policy, national security, defence spending and judicial appointments. They also represent the country on the international stage and can veto important EU votes. Last November’s cancelled first round waswon by Călin Georgescu, a far-right, Moscow-friendly independent, but wasannulled by Romania’s top courtafter declassified intelligence documents revealed an alleged Russian influence operation. Georgescu, who denies any wrongdoing, was laterplaced under investigationon counts including misreporting campaign finances, misuse of digital technology and promoting fascist groups. In March, he wasbarred from standing in the rerun. Simion promised on Sunday to make Georgescu prime minister, either through a referendum, early elections or forming a new government coalition, if he won. Simion denies his policies are far-right but has described his party as “natural allies” of Trump and promised an alliance of EU countries “in the spirit of Maga”. He has frequently criticised Russia, but consistently opposed military aid to Ukraine.",

    "title": "UK access to EU crime and illegal migration data reportedly denied",
    "article_text": "A UK request for access to sharedEuropean Unioncrime and illegal migration data has reportedly been rejected in a blow to Keir Starmer’s hopes of a post-Brexit relations “reset”. British negotiators have been hoping to reach a deal on gaining access to the Schengen Information System (SIS), avital tool for sharing police alerts across borders within the area where 29 countries have abolished passport controls. However, European officials were reported by the Times to have ruled out allowing access to it and to the bloc’s centralised fingerprinting system, Eurodac, which stores information on illegal migrants. Access to the records would be a significant boost to attempts by the Labour government to clear Britain’s asylum claims and appeals backlog at a time when political opponents on the populist right are on the rise. The prime minister suggested last yearat an Interpol annual general assembly in Glasgow that EU leaders had shown an interest in giving the UK access to the intelligence database used to identify people seeking asylum. Asked whether he could detect enthusiasm from EU leaders about giving the UK access to Eurodac data as part of a new security deal, he told journalists: “Yes, there is an appetite to work more closely with us on this. Because look, these are shared challenges.” Daniel Moylan, the Conservative transport spokesperson, said on Monday that the prime minister had cast his reset of relations with the EU as a “magic bullet” to deliver on Labour’s manifesto pledge to “smash the gangs” when it came to illegal Channel crossings. “It’s not working. He needs to start taking action in the UK and stop creeping to Brussels,” Lord Moylan added. A UK government spokesperson said: “We are not providing a running commentary on our discussions with the EU. These are ongoing and cover a wide range of issues.“Together we want to build a safer, more secure and more prosperous UK and we have been clear that we will always act in the national interest to secure the best outcomes for the UK.” The European Commission has been approached for comment. In the absence of a deal on giving access to Eurodac and Schengen data, one area of potential progress revolves around work and travel freedoms. The EU is prepared to make major concessions in negotiations to allow British and European 18- to 30-year-olds to travel and work freely,the Guardian reported last month. However, there have been suggestions that figures in the British government have made access to EU databases a “red line” in negotiations over such a youth mobility scheme. Sign up toHeadlines Europe A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day after newsletter promotion The previous UK government signed a deal earlier last year for Britain work more closely with the EU’s border agency to stop small boats crossing the Channel. But the lack of access to the Eurodac fingerprinting system – which stores more than 7m fingerprint records and was lost to Britain with the ending of the Brexit transition period in December 2020 – limits potential collaboration. Access would help returns by proving individuals had rightful residence in other countries. Cooperation to tackle illegal migration, together with counter terror cooperation, is one of the three pillars that the UK government has been working on as part of a touted “reset” of UK-EU relations. The others are on foreign policy and security cooperation and growth and trade cooperation.",

    "title": "Spain: cable theft that caused rail chaos was ‘act of sabotage’, says minister",
    "article_text": "Spain’s transport minister has said the country’s rail network suffered “an act of serious sabotage” after vital signalling cable was stolen over the busy bank holiday weekend, bringing severe delays to high-speed services between Madrid and Seville that affected more than 10,000 travellers. Government sources said the problems on the line between the capital and the southern region of Andalucía had been caused by the theft of copper cable from five different locations in the Toledo area, south of Madrid, late on Sunday. They said that while the cables that had been targeted had little monetary value – being worth a total of around €300 (£256) – they were essential to the safety of the lines as they allow the system to know where trains are. “If those safety cables are taken, then the line is blind,” they added. “They’re optimal if you want to put the whole line out of service.” As the country’s state-owned rail operator, Renfe, and the railway infrastructure company, Adif, rushed to restore services, Spain’s transport minister, Óscar Puente, said: “We have suffered an act of serious sabotage on the high-speed line between Madrid and Seville”. He urged anyone with information to contact the police. In a radio interview on Monday morning, Puente said the network appeared to have been deliberately targeted. “This is a low-value theft,” he told Cadena Ser. “Whoever did it knew what they were doing because there were no cameras and the financial gain is absolutely negligible compared with the enormous damage.” The minister said he viewed the incident as “damage” rather than theft, adding that it involved 150 metres of cable. Álvaro Fernández Heredia, the president of Renfe, said he also felt the theft was suspicious. “It’s strange and I’m sure the transport ministry and the police will be looking into this because it isn’t something we’ve seen up until now,” he toldRadio Nacional de España. Asked if he shared Puente’s contention that it was a case of sabotage: “I do … The theft of signalling cable on which the safety infrastructure depends is sabotage, even if it’s just simple theft because it’s an attack on the infrastructure itself.” The interior ministry said the Guardia Civil had opened an investigation, adding that both that force and the Policía Nacional had long been in contact with Adif as part of a special plan for prevent the theft of copper from the rail network. According to interior ministry statistics, there were 4,433 thefts involving copper and conductive materials last year. By 9.30am on Monday, Renfe and Adif said the Madrid to Seville line was running again and hoped services would return to normal over the course of the day. By early Monday morning, Alberto Valero and his family, visiting Spain from Mexico, had spent hours at Madrid’s Atocha station, waiting for a train to Seville.“We’re here with tourists from everywhere; France, Portugal,” Valero told the Associated Press. “Everyone is at a loss for what to do because of the total disarray.” The severe delays came a week afterSpain and neighbouring Portugal suffered an unprecedented and as yet unexplained power blackout, prompting the opposition conservative People’s party (PP) to accuse the socialist-led government of incompetence. “We’ve had two events in the past week that are more commonly seen in countries we wouldn’t want to resemble; countries where the government has forgotten about its citizens,” said PP sources. The PP’s leader, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, said thousands of people had been stranded on trains overnight without water. “This is the second Monday when we’ve had scenes that do not befit the fourth-largest eurozone economy,” he said. “People don’t deserve to be paying more taxes for worse services. Spain needs to function again and that’s my aim.” Inan interview with El País on Sunday, Spain’s environment minister, Sara Aagesen, warned it could take days to discover the reasons for last week’s power outage. She alsoechoed her view that it was far too soon for opposition parties and others to be pointing the finger at the country’s renewable energy sourcesas a possible cause. “Blaming renewable as a [reason for the blackout] seems irresponsible and simplistic to me,” said Aagesen. “Irresponsible because we’re talking about a resource that has been part of our energetic mix for a long time. And, besides, we’ve had very similar power generation on many previous days, with lots of renewables and even with lower demand – and the system has worked perfectly.”",

The rebels’ media office said at least six strikes hit the crucial Hodeida port on Monday afternoon. Other strikes hit a cement factory in the Bajil district in Hodeida province, the rebels said.

It was the first time a missile had struck the grounds of Israel’s airport since the start of the war. TheHouthisclaimed that the strikes were a joint Israeli-American operation. However, a US defence official said Washington did not participate in the strikes, which were not part of Operation Rough Rider, the US military operation against the Houthis in Yemen to prevent them from targeting ships in the Red Sea. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity. However, the US military separately launched multiple strikes on the Yemeni capital, Sana’a, on Monday, according to another US official. Nasruddin Amer, head of the Houthi media office, said the Israeli strikes would not deter the rebels, vowing that they will respond to the attack. “The aggressive Zionist-American raids on civilian facilities will not affect our military operations against the Zionist enemy entity,” he said in a social media post. He said the Houthis will escalate their attacks and won’t stop targeting shipping routes and Israel until it stopsthe war in Gaza. The Houthis have targeted Israel throughout the war in solidarity with Palestinians, raising their profile at home and internationally as the last member of Iran’s self-described “Axis of Resistance” capable of launching regular attacks on Israel. The US military under President Donald Trump has launched an intensified campaign of daily airstrikes targeting the Houthis since 15 March. Houthi rebels have fired at Israel since the war with Gaza began on 7 October 2023. The missiles have mostly been intercepted, although some have penetrated Israel’s missile defence systems, causing damage. Israel has struck back against the rebels in Yemen. The Israeli military said it targeted the Hodeida port on Monday because Houthi rebels were using it to receive weapons and military equipment from Iran. The attack on Ben-Gurion international airport on Sunday came hours before Israeli cabinet ministers voted to expand the war in Gaza, including toseize the Gaza Strip and to stay in the Palestinian territory for an unspecified amount of time. While air traffic resumed after an hour, the attack could lead to cancellations of many airlines, which had recently resumed flights to Israel.",

    "title": "Middle East crisis: Gaza offensive includes ‘wide-scale attack’ and ‘moving majority of the population’, says IDF – as it happened",
    "article_text": "This live blog is now closed. For the latest on the Israel-Gaza war, read our full report: TheIsrael Defense Forces(IDF) said its planned expanded offensive inGazaincludes a “wide-scale attack” and “moving the majority of the population” of the Palestinian territory. A statement from IDF spokesperson Effie Defrin, reported by the Times of Israel, says: The goal of the operation is the return of our hostages and the defeat of Hamas’s rule. These two goals are combined with each other. The offensive “will include a wide-scale attack and the movement of the majority of the strip’s population, this is to protect them in an area sterile of Hamas. And continued airstrikes, elimination of terrorists, and dismantling of infrastructure,” he said. Israel’s plan to expand its military operation inGazawas unanimously approved at a security cabinet meeting late on Sunday. Officials have said it would involved a new and intense offensive leading to “the conquest of Gaza and the holding of the territories, moving the Gaza population south for their protection [and] … powerful blows against Hamas”, going beyond any aims so far outlined by Israel for its offensive in Gaza. It’s just past 10pm inGazaand Tel Aviv. Here’s a recap of the latest developments: Benjamin Netanyahu announced a new “intensified” offensive in Gaza that will involve Israeli troops holding on to seized territory and significant displacement of the population.Israeli soldiers would not go into Gaza, launch raids and then retreat, Netanyahu said. “The intention is the opposite of that … Population will be moved, for its own protection.” Israel’s security cabinet approved the plan on Sunday night for “conquering” the Gaza Strip and establishing a “sustained presence” there.The plan, which was unanimously approved, goes beyond any aims so far outlined byIsraelfor its offensive in the devastated Palestinian territory. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the new offensive, named Operation Gideon’s Chariots, would “include a wide-scale attack and the movement of the majority of the strip’s population. The announcement is a significant moment, at least in terms of public rhetoric, and will confirm many people’s long-held fears of Israel’s intentions in Gaza and prompt international outrage. The Israeli announcement prompted deep international concern and fierce opposition.A spokesperson for the UN secretary general,António Guterres,said the Israeli plan will “inevitably lead to countless more civilians killed and the further destruction of Gaza.” A spokesperson for theBritish Foreign Officesaid: “The UK does not support an expansion of Israel’s military operations in Gaza. Continued fighting is in nobody’s interests.” Donald Trump did not offer his views on Israel’s plan but blamed Hamas for having treated the people of Gaza “very badly”.The US will “help the people of Gaza get some food,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “Hamas is making it impossible, because they’re taking everything that’s brought in.” Israel sees Trump’s visit to the Middle East next week as a “window of opportunity” for a hostage deal in Gaza.Israel is reportedly trying to “leverage” the US president’s trip to push Hamas to accept a deal, with a report claiming that Israel will launch a massive ground operation if no deal is reached. Israel’s military said it carried out airstrikes against Yemen’s Hodeidah port, a day after the Houthi group fired a missile that struck near Israel’s main airport.More than 10 strikes targeted Hodeidah Port and the Al Salakhanah and Al Hawak neighbourhoods in Hodeidah City, Reuters reported. Four strikes also targeted a cement factory east of Hodeidah. The announcement ofIsrael’s plan tolaunch imminently a new, expanded offensive inGazaand to retain the territory it seized is a significant moment, at least in terms of public rhetoric. Throughout the nearly 19-month war, Israeli troops have carried out large and frequently bloody operations that have covered all except central parts of Gaza, but they have largely restricted their permanent presence to a buffer zone about 1km deep along the devastated territory’s perimeter and two relatively narrow east-west corridors. This now seems to have changed. Once “Operation Gideon’s Chariots” is under way, Israel will send its troops across much – if not all – ofGaza, and will seek to establish a “sustained presence” there, Israel officials said. Israeli officials are also talking openly about the displacement of Palestinians to southern Gaza, and their potential “voluntary” displacement from the territory altogether to allow the implementation of the reconstruction plan announced by the US president, Donald Trump, in January. The far-right Israeli finance minister,Bezalel Smotrich,told Israelis on Mondayto embrace the word “occupation”. All this will confirm many people’s long-held fears of Israel’s intentions in Gaza and prompt international outrage. Read the full analysis here:Announcement of Israel’s Gaza occupation plan is carefully timed Donald Trumphas said the US will “help the people ofGazaget some food” as he blamed Hamas for having treated them “very badly”. Asked about Israeli plans for an expanded offensive in Gaza, Trump did not offer his views on Israel’s operations. Instead, he said: Hamas is making it impossible, because they’re taking everything that’s brought in. But we’re going to help the people of Gaza because they’re being treated very badly by Hamas. Israel’s air force has confirmed it carried out strikes inYemen’s port city ofHodeidah. In a series of posts on X, it said the attack by its fighter jets was carried out in response to Houthi attacks against Israeli targets. The statement continues: The [Israel Defense Forces] IDF is determined to continue to act and strike forcefully against anyone who poses a threat to the residents and citizens of the State of Israel. TheIsrael Defense Forces(IDF) said its planned expanded offensive inGazaincludes a “wide-scale attack” and “moving the majority of the population” of the Palestinian territory. A statement from IDF spokesperson Effie Defrin, reported by the Times of Israel, says: The goal of the operation is the return of our hostages and the defeat of Hamas’s rule. These two goals are combined with each other.

The UN’s secretary generalAntónio Guterresis “alarmed” byIsraeliplans to expand military operations inGazaand seek the “conquest” of the territory, a UN spokesperson has said. “This will inevitably lead to countless more civilians killed and the further destruction ofGaza,” said Farhan Haq, adding: Gaza is, and must remain, an integral part of a future Palestinian state. Israeliofficials have confirmed that the Israeli air force is carrying out strikes inYemen’s port city ofHodeidah,the Times ofIsraelis reporting. Separately, Axios is citing an Israeli official as saying that the strikes were coordinated with the US but that American forces were not actively involved. A US official confirmed that Israel notified Washington in advance of the strike, Axiosreports. Israel’s air force has conducted airstrikes in the port city ofHodeidahinYemen,Reuters reports, citing Houthi-affiliated media. Six strikes targeted the Hodeidah port, Al Masirah TV reported, blaming the strikes on Israel and the US. The reported strikes come after the Houthi group fired a missile fromYemenat the grounds of Israel’s main airport on Sunday morning. As wereported earlier,Israel’s prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, had vowed to retaliate against the Houthis after the strike. Wereported earlierthat a seniorIsraelidefence official said there was a “window of opportunity” for a hostage deal inGazaduringDonald Trump’s visit to the region next week. The Times ofIsrael, citing an Israeli official said Israel is trying to “leverage” the US president’s trip to push Hamas to accept a deal. Qatar is no longer “putting spokes in the wheels” of the Egyptian proposal for a deal, the official told the outlet. The paper quotes the official as saying: We hope that all these factors will come together in the coming days and maybe will lead to a deal … If we come to an agreement, that is, if Hamas agrees to the Israeli conditions – because that is the only way we will reach an agreement – then the rest of the hostages would be released and the war would end. Israel’s far-right national security minister,Itamar Ben Gvir,has reiterated his opposition to any humanitarian aid entering Gaza. His comments came after Israel’s security cabinet approved a plan to seize all of theGazaStrip, including allowing the Israeli military to take over aid deliveries into the Palestinian territory. Ben-Gvir was the only one who voted against the proposal. “The only aid that ought to enter Gaza should be for voluntary migration, to allow them to emigrate voluntarily,” he said in comments carried by Israeli media. As long as there are hostages no food, no electricity, and no other aid should be allowed – neither by the [Israeli military] nor by civil society. Donald Trumpsaid he had a “very good and productive” call withTurkey’s president,Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, on Monday. The pair discussed the war in Ukraine and “all things Syria, Gaza, and more,” Trump said in aposton his Truth Social platform. Trump said he was invited to go to Turkey and that Erdoğan will also be visiting Washington DC. The Turkish presidency, in its readout of the Trump-Erdoğan call, said Erdoğan expressed support for US negotiations with Iran and efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war. Finland’s minister for foreign affairs,Elina Valtonen,has said she is “deeply concerned” about Israel’s plans to expand its military operation in Gaza. In a post on X on Monday, Valtonen wrote: I once again urge all parties to return to a ceasefire, and Hamas to immediately release the remaining hostages. Israel must ensure unimpeded access of humanitarian aid to Gaza. Here’s more fromIran’s foreign minister,Abbas Araghchi,who accusedBenjamin Netanyahuof “directly meddling” with the US government to “drag it into another disaster” in the Middle East region. The Israeli leader is attempting to “brazenly dictate what President[Donald] Trumpcan and cannot do in his diplomacy with Iran,” Araghchi wrote in a post on X on Monday. Iran’s top diplomat warned against any attempt to attack Iran: If the goal is “The only thing they can’t have is a nuclear weapon” as President Trump just said, a deal is achievable and there is only ONE PATH to achieve it: DIPLOMACY based on MUTUAL RESPECT and MUTUAL INTERESTS. His comments came after Netanyahu blamed Tehran after the Iran-backedHouthigroup claimed a missile strike near Israel’s main airport on Sunday. Iran denied any role in the attack. It also comes after the latest round of nuclear talks with the US, which were scheduled for 3 May, were delayed with mediator Oman citing “logistical reasons”. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a new offensive in Gaza will be an intensive military operation aimed at defeating Hamas that would involve moving the population of Gaza.He stopped short of detailing just how much of the enclave’s territory would be seized following earlier reports that Israel could aim to capture the whole of the Gaza Strip. Two Israeli officials said earlier today that Israel’s security cabinet had approved a plan to capture all of the Gaza Strip and remain there for an unspecified amount of time.The two officials said the plan would involve the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to southernGaza. A senior Israeli defence official said there was a “window of opportunity” for a hostage deal in Gaza during US President Donald Trump’s visit to the region next week.It allows for the possibility thatIsraelmight agree to a ceasefire in the meantime. Israel will not withdraw from the Gaza Strip even if there is another hostage deal is reached, far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich insisted as he called on Israelis to embrace the word “occupation.”“We are finally going to occupy theGazaStrip. We will stop being afraid of the word ‘occupation,’” Smotrich told journalist from Israel’s Channel 12. An Israeli campaign group said the plan would mean “sacrificing” hostages held in the Palestinian territory.“The plan approved by the cabinet deserves to be called the ‘Smotrich-Netanyahu Plan’ for sacrificing the hostages,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement. Yemen’s Houthis said the US carried out strikes in and around Sana’a, after the Iran-backed rebels claimed a missile strike on Israel’s main airport yesterday.The Houthi-run Saba news agency said the strikes included two on Arbaeen Street in the capital and the airport road, blaming them on “American aggression”. Saba said 16 people were wounded. Israeli prime ministerBenjamin Netanyahusaid that a new offensive inGazawill be an intensive military operation aimed at defeating Hamas, but stopped short of detailing just how much of the enclave’s territory would be seized, Reuters reports. “Population will be moved, for its own protection,” Netanyahu said in a video posted on X. He said Israeli soldiers won’t go intoGaza, launch raids and then retreat. “The intention is the opposite of that,” he said. Earlier today two Israeli officials said Israel’s security cabinet had approved a plan to capture all of the Gaza Strip and remain there for an unspecified amount of time. There was one arrest at a protest outside Israel’s parliament, the Knesset today, according to the Times ofIsrael. Demonstrators were protesting againstBenjamin Netayahu’sgovernment and for the return of the remaining 59 hostages trapped inGaza. Police forcibly dispersed protesters who were blocking the road leading to the prime minister’s office. peaking to Israel’s Channel 12, protesters said they showed up to demonstrate over a number of issues, including the failure to recover the hostages, the mass call-up of IDF reservists, and the treatment of the country’s educators amid ongoing wage disputes. Iran’sforeign ministerAbbas Araghchihas accused Israeli prime ministerBenjamin Netanyahuof attempting to drag the US into “disaster” in the Middle East, warning against any attempt to attack Iran, AFP reports. “Netanyahu is directly MEDDLING within the US Government to DRAG it into another DISASTER in our region,” Araghchi said on X, warning against “ANY mistake against Iran”. France has condemned the Houthi strike against Israel’s Ben Gurion airport yesterday. “The Houthi attacks against Israel are unacceptable and can only fuel high regional tensions, further delaying an end to the conflict. They must cease immediately,” a statement from the French foreign ministry said. “France reiterates its commitment to Israel’s security and reaffirms the right of the Israeli people to live in peace and security, as well as its commitment to regional stability.” “The Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs, through its diplomatic and consular network, remains attentive to the situation of French citizens present in Israel, whether residents or passing through.”",

    "title": "Netanyahu says new offensive in Gaza focused on consolidating seizure of territory",
    "article_text": "Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, has said a new “intensified” offensive in Gaza will involve Israeli troops holding on to seized territory and significant displacement of the population. Speaking after officials said Israel’s security cabinet had approved a plan for “conquering” theGazaStrip and establishing a “sustained presence” there, Netanyahu posted a video on X in which he said Israeli soldiers would not go into Gaza, launch raids and then retreat. “The intention is the opposite of that,” he said. “Population will be moved, for its own protection.” Brig Gen Efi Dufferin, the chief Israeli military spokesperson, said in a statement shortly afterwards that Operation Gideon’s Chariots, as the new offensive has been named, would “include a wide-scale attack and the movement of the majority of the strip’s population, this is to protect them in an area sterile of Hamas. And continued airstrikes, elimination of terrorists, and dismantling of infrastructure.” The plan, which was unanimously approved at a security cabinet meeting late on Sunday, goes beyond any aims so far outlined by Israel for its offensive in the devastated Palestinian territory and is likely to prompt deep international concern and fierce opposition. “This will inevitably lead to countless more civilians killed and the further destruction of Gaza,” said a spokesperson for António Guterres, the United Nations secretary general. “Gaza is, and must remain, an integral part of a future Palestinian state.” A spokesperson for the British Foreign Office said: “The UK does not support an expansion of Israel’s military operations in Gaza. Continued fighting is in nobody’s interests.” After a fragile ceasefire collapsed in mid-March, Israel renewed its bombardment, with troops reinforcing kilometre-deep “buffer zones” along the perimeter of the territory andexpanding their holdover much of the north and south of the strip. In all, more than 70% of Gaza is under Israeli control or covered by orders issued by Israel telling Palestinian civilians to evacuate specific neighbourhoods. On Sunday, the army chief, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, said the military was calling up tens of thousands of reservists to allow for conscripted regular troops to be deployed to Gaza for the new offensive. Zamir has resisted calls by some Israeli ministers for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to take on the job of distributing aid in Gaza, which has been under a tight blockade by Israel for more than two months. Much of the 2.3 million population can no longer find enough to eat and the humanitarian system is close to collapse,aid officialsin the territory have said. Israeli officials told local media that ministers believed there was “currently enough food” in the territory, but that they approved “the possibility of a humanitarian distribution, if necessary, to prevent Hamas from taking control of the supplies and to destroy its governance capabilities”. Israel says the blockade and intensified bombardments since mid-March are to put pressure on Hamas to release hostages held in Gaza. Militants in the territory still hold 58 hostages seized in Hamas’s October 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Israel’s retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 52,535 people in Gaza, the majority of them civilians, according to the health ministry there. The officials also said Netanyahu “continues to promote” a proposal made in January by Donald Trump to displace the millions of Palestinians living in Gaza to neighbouring countries such as Jordan or Egypt, to allow its reconstruction. A “voluntary transfer programme for Gaza residents … will be part of the operation’s goals”, the senior security official said. Israel’s military on Monday carried outa fresh round of airstrikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen’s Red Sea city of Hodeida, a day after the Iranian-backed rebels launched a missile that hit Israel’s main airport. The rebels’ media office said at least six strikes hit the crucial Hodeida port Monday afternoon. Other strikes hit a cement factory in the Bajil district in Hodeida province, the rebels said. Israeli media reported that dozens of Israeli air force took part in the operation. Trump’s scheduled visit later this month to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and UAE may provide an additional incentive to the Israeli government to conclude a new ceasefire deal and allow aid into Gaza. Trump, who recently said he wanted Netanyahu to be “good to Gaza”, is likely to come under pressure from his hosts to push Israel to make concessions to end the conflict. Israeli military officials say seizing territory provides Israel with additional leverage in its negotiations with Hamas, and some observers suggest that the public announcement of the new offensive and plans for a longer-term presence in Gaza are merely aimed at putting pressure on the militant Islamist group. Humanitarian organisations have unanimouslyrejected Israel’s planto establish a limited number of aid distribution hubs run by private contractors and guarded by the IDF in southern Gaza. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) on Sunday accused Israel of trying to shut down the existing aid distribution system run by the UN and its humanitarian partners in order to impose its own supply system. “[This] contravenes fundamental humanitarian principles … It is dangerous, driving civilians into militarised zones to collect rations, threatening lives … while further entrenching forced displacement,” OCHA said. Hamas on Monday described the new Israeli framework for aid delivery in Gaza as “political blackmail” and blamed Israel for the war-ravaged territory’s “humanitarian catastrophe”. In Israel, hundreds of protesters took to the streets in Jerusalem while a coalition representing the majority of families of hostages held by Hamas, about half of whom are thought to be dead, condemned the planned new offensive as a threat the lives of hostages and Israeli soldiers. Netanyahu’s governing coalition – and so his hold on power – depends heavily on the support of hardline rightwing parties that have long demanded the reoccupation and resettlement of Gaza, which Israel formally left in 2005. A new parliamentary session opened on Monday. Israeli strikes across Gaza continued overnight and during Monday, killing at least 32 people in the territory, according to hospital staff. Strikes hit Gaza City, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya and among the dead were eight women and children, according to staff at al-Shifa hospital, where the bodies were brought.",

Throughout the nearly 19-month war, Israeli troops have carried out large and frequently bloody operations that have covered all except central parts of Gaza, but they have largely restricted their permanent presence to a buffer zone about 1km deep along the devastated territory’s perimeter and two relatively narrow east-west corridors.

The far-right Israeli finance minister,Bezalel Smotrich, told Israelis on Mondayto embrace the word “occupation”. All this will confirm many people’s long-held fears of Israel’s intentions in Gaza and prompt international outrage. The idea of a major new offensive in Gaza has been discussed and debated within the government and the upper ranks of the military for some months. So why has Israel’s government announced this plan so loudly? And why now? A key factor is the indirect talks being held with Hamas about a new ceasefire. The government of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, hopes that the Israel Defense Forces’ call-up of tens of thousands of reservists, the threat of the new offensive and the prospect of Israel seizing swaths of territory will force Hamas’s leaders to make concessions. If it fails to do so, then physical possession of terrain will offer useful leverage in future negotiations and allow Hamas to be squeezed further in the meantime. Israel’s twin war aims – to crush Hamas and free the 59 hostages it still holds – remain unchanged, though Netanyahu has signaled the former is the priority. Trump is due to visit the Middle East in 10 days, and Israeli officials said the offensive would start after the leader of their country’s most important ally had enjoyed the hospitality of Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar. Images of destruction and death from Gaza would make the president’s stay that much more diplomatically delicate. In reality, the complex logistics necessary to move and mobilise additional troops in Israel is likely to mean an even longer delay. Israel has also now gone public with its plan to allow some aid into Gaza, which has been brought to “the brink of catastrophe”, aid officials say, by two months of Israel’s tight blockade of food, fuel, medicine and everything else. The scheme involves creating big distribution sites run by private contractors in the south of Gaza, to which vetted representatives of each Palestinian family would travel to pick up food parcels. Israeli troops would guard the bases, likely to be situated in a vast zone up to 5km wide now being cleared along the border with Egypt. The scheme has been dismissed as unworkable, dangerous and potentially illegal under international law by leading humanitarian organisations. There has been no mention either of who might provide healthcare, sanitation, water, fuel and everything else necessary for life in the territory. Policy papers outlining and advocating the imposition of a military administration on Gaza have been circulating among senior officials in Israel for more than a year. Netanyahu continues to dismiss out of hand the possibility of the Palestinian Authority, which exercises partial authority in the occupied West Bank, governing the territory. Nor has he outlined any other kind of future political settlement in Gaza. The likely result, should the new offensive go ahead, would be that Israeli troops end up the de facto rulers of much of Gaza and its 2.3 million inhabitants. The Israeli prime minister also offers little to the majority of Israelis who call for a ceasefire deal to secure the release of the hostages. His coalition still depends heavily on the support of far-right parties who are very happy with the prospect of the new offensive and the prospect of a “sustained” Israeli presence in Gaza. Netanyahu now appears likely to remain in power for the 15 months or so until the next elections. More than 1,200 people died, mostly civilians, in the Hamas surprise raid into Israel in 2023 that triggered the war, and about 250 were taken prisoner, of whom 58 remain in Gaza. More than 52,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have died in the Israeli offensive there which followed. On Monday – among all the outrage and enthusiasm generated by Operation Gideon’s Chariots – the announcement that Israel’s security cabinet had decided not to establish “at this time”a state commission of inquiryinto the failures that allowed that attack to take place went almost unnoticed. Any inquiry should wait until the war has ended, Netanyahu told Israelis.",

    "title": "Francis’s popemobile to become a mobile clinic for children in Gaza",
    "article_text": "Just over a decade ago, the converted Mitsubishi whiskedPope Francisthrough the streets of Bethlehem before it was left to gather dust. Now, in keeping with one of the late pontiff’s last wishes, the popemobile is being given a second life – as a mobile health clinic for children in the Gaza Strip. In a region ravaged by more than18 months of war,the initiative is both symbolic and practical, said Peter Brune, the secretary general of the Catholic charity Caritas Sweden. “We call it a vehicle of hope because it conveys a message to the children ofGazathat peace is possible, there will be peace, you will have a future and the world has not forgotten about you. And then there’s the very practical dimension in that it will actually deliver medical aid to affected children.” Brune and his counterpart at Caritas Jerusalem, Anton Asfar, came up with the idea late last year. They soon arranged to have the question put to Pope Francis. “We got a letter from the pope saying, ‘Yes I’m glad to say that I fully endorse this idea’,” said Brune. Work swiftly began on fitting out the vehicle, which had been left sitting in Bethlehem since the 2014 visit, with supplies such as rapid tests for infections, suture kits and oxygen as well as a refrigerator for medication. It will be used to diagnose and treat children who have no access to healthcare, bolstering the aid provided by Caritas Jerusalem, which has about 100 staff on the ground in Gaza. “This is a concrete, life-saving intervention at a time when the health system in Gaza has almost completely collapsed,” said Brune. The announcement, made days beforethe start of the conclaveto elect a new pope, echoes Francis’s deep commitment to those caught in the crossfire of the conflict.He had long called for an end to the hostilities and voiced his disapproval at how the war was being carried out. “Yesterday children were bombed. This is cruelty, this is not war,”he said in Decemberafter an Israeli airstrike killed seven children from one family. He added: “I want to say it because it touches my heart.” For much of the past year and a half, Francis had madenightly callsto Gaza’s only Catholic church, offering his unwavering support to the congregation as they grappled with the pain and devastation of war. “It was close to his heart,” said Brune. “Since the war broke out, 3% of the Christians in Gaza have been killed.” The transformed popemobile is expected to be ready in a week or so, said Brune, and talks have been launched in the hope of obtaining permission from Israeli officials to bring it into Gaza. Brune described the situation on the ground as urgent. “Since 2 March, no aid has been let into Gaza at all. It’s horrible. A few months ago, when it was cold, children were freezing to death. Now they’re starving to death.” While aid groups have warned that Israel’s blockade offood and medicineinto Gaza has left civilians in the territoryfacing starvation, Israel has said that the blockade, along with its renewed military campaign, is aimed at pressuring Hamas to release the remaining hostages. Unicefsaid last monththat the conflict had killed more than 15,000 children, injured tens of thousands of others and left nearly 1 million children repeatedly displaced in the Gaza Strip, adding to warnings that the humanitarian situation had reachedits worst pointsince the hostilities broke out in 2023. The war in Gaza was triggered by a surprise attack launched by Hamas into Israel on 7 October, in which militants killed more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 250 hostages. Israeli officials say 59 hostages remain in Gaza, more than half of whom are believed to be dead. Brune called for aid to be let in. “It’s forbidden to use civilians and, even worse, children as some kind of instrument in an ongoing war between adults,” he said. “It’s against all humanitarian principles and laws.” He hoped the popemobile’s transformation would set a precedent of sorts, paving the way for other papal vehicles to be repurposed. “Maybe Gaza now, but then Ukraine in the future or Congo or other places,” he said. “Everywhere where humanitarian access is denied, we want to apply the principle of saying that the popemobile will stand for the importance of letting humanitarian aid come through.”",

    "title": "India tries to halt auction of Piprahwa gems found with Buddha’s remains",
    "article_text": "The Indian government has issued a legal notice to halt the “unethical” auction of ancient gem relics, which it said should be treated as the sacred body of the Buddha. Its ministry of culture said theauction of the Piprahwa gemsin Hong Kong this week “violates Indian and international laws, as well as United Nations conventions”, and demanded their repatriation to India “for preservation and religious veneration”. The legal notice has been served on Sotheby’s Hong Kong and Chris Peppé, one of three heirs of William Claxton Peppé, a British colonial landowner who in 1898excavated the gems on his estate in northern India, who are selling the relics. The auction, which has promptedan outcry from scholars and monastic leaders, is scheduled for 7 May, and the gems are expected to sell for about HK$100m (£9.7m). A letter,posted on the ministry of culture’s Instagram account, said Peppé, a Los Angeles-based TV director and film editor, lacked the authority to sell the relics. Sotheby’s, by holding the auction, was “participating in continued colonial exploitation”, it added. The ministry insisted on the immediate cessation of the auction, saying the gem relics “constitute inalienable religious and cultural heritage of India and the global Buddhist community”. It also called on Sotheby’s and Chris Peppé to issue a public apology to the Indian government and Buddhists worldwide, and for the full disclosure of all provenance documents and any other relics in the possession of William Peppé’s heirs or transferred by them to any other entity or individual. Failure to comply would result in legal proceedings in Indian andHong Kongcourts and through international bodies “for violations of cultural heritage laws”, the letter warned. The ministry added that it would launch a public campaign highlighting Sotheby’s role “in perpetuating colonial injustice and becoming a party to [the] unethical sale of religious relics”. The gems include amethysts, coral, garnets, pearls, rock crystals, shells and gold, either worked into pendants, beads and other ornaments, or in their natural form. They were originally buried in a dome-shaped funerary monument, called a stupa, in Piprahwa, in present-day Uttar Pradesh, India, on about 240-200BC, when they were mixed with some of the cremated remains of the Buddha, who died about 480BC. The British crown claimed Peppé’s find under the 1878 Indian Treasure Trove Act, and the bones and ash were given to the Buddhist monarch King Chulalongkorn of Siam. Most of the 1,800 gems went to what is now the Indian Museum in Kolkata. Peppé was permitted to retain approximately a fifth of them, which were described as “duplicates” of some of the others. On the matter of the gems’ provenance and ownership, the ministry’s letter noted that under the Buddhist religion, materials in sacred funerary mounds are “sacred grave goods … inseparable from the sacred relics and cannot be commodified. “We beg to note that the relics of the Buddha cannot be treated as ‘specimens’ but as the sacred body and originally interred offerings to the sacred body of the Buddha.” The ministry added that the sellers, who describe themselves as custodians of the gems “had no right to alienate or misappropriate the asset … an extraordinary heritage of humanity where custodianship would include not just safe upkeep but also an unflinching sentiment of veneration towards these relics”. Its letter said the proposed auction “offends the sentiments of over 500 million Buddhists worldwide”, violated ethics and disrupted sacred tradition. Peppé, who wrote a piece for Sotheby’sabout his family’s custodianship of the gems, has been contacted for comment. He previously told the Guardian that the “Piprahwa gems were relic offerings made at the time of the reinterment of the Buddha’s ashes over 200 years after his passing. I have not found any Buddhists who claim the gems are corporeal remains.” With regards to his and his two relatives’ right to sell the gems, he added: “Legally, the ownership is unchallenged.” Sotheby’s has been contacted for comment. It previously told the Guardian that it has conducted “requisite due diligence”, including in relation to provenance and legality. The Indian ministry of culture’s Instagram post stated that “Sotheby’s has responded to the legal notice with the assurance that full attention is being given to this matter.”",

    "title": "UK consumer confidence at lowest level since December 2022, says Which?",
    "article_text": "Consumer confidence in the UK economy has fallen to the lowest levels since the height of thecost of living crisis, as people worry about the impact of US tariffs and Russia’s war in Ukraine. Almost two-thirds of people believe the economy will get worse in the next 12 months, while only 11% think it will improve, according to a survey from the consumer group Which?. Its consumer confidence tracker fell by seven points to -53, the lowest point since December 2022, when the cost of living crisis was at its worst and the inflation rate was above 10% – well above the Bank of England’s 2% target. Nearly seven in 10 people (67%) said they felt gloomy about the economy because of global events such as the war in Ukraine, and Donald Trump’s tariffs and trade policy. Other reasons include changes in prices, cited by 63% of people, and government tax changes, cited by 60%. This echoes findings from the data company GfK, whose consumer insights directorNeil Bellamy said consumers had been grappling with “multiple April cost increases”in the form of higher utility bills, council tax, stamp duty and road tax, and were also “hearing dire warnings of renewed high inflation on the back of the Trump tariffs”. Confidence in future household finances also worsened, by 10 points to -19, the lowest level recorded since July 2023, according to the Which? report. Confidence in current household finances fell by six points to +21. The number of households missing essential payments, such as rent or mortgage, utility bills, credit card or loan payments, remained at similar levels to March, at 1.9 million households, in the month to 11 April. Which? estimates that between 5.6% and 7.7% of households missed or defaulted on a housing, bill or credit payment. The proportion of tenants missing rent payments increased to 4.7% in the past month, as many are still struggling to make ends meet due to continuing cost of living pressures. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion An estimated 13 million households, nearly half the total (46%), were forced to make at least one adjustment to cover essential spending such as energy bills, housing costs, groceries, school supplies and medicines in the last month. Adjustments include cutting back on essentials, dipping into savings, selling possessions or borrowing. This is slightly lower than the 51% in March. Rocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy at Which?, said: “Consumer protections give people the confidence to spend, so whether it’s rooting out online fraudsters, taking down rogue traders or tackling misleading business practices, the government must do more to place consumers at the heart of its plans to grow the economy and restore people’s confidence.”",

    "title": "More than 1m older people in England waited over 12 hours in A&E last year",
    "article_text": "More than 1 million older people a year inEnglandare forced to wait longer than 12 hours in A&E, with many having to endure “degrading and dehumanising” corridor waits on trolleys. The number aged 60 and over waiting more than 12 hours to be transferred, admitted or discharged increased to 1.15 million in 2024, up from 991,068 in 2023. The figure was 305,619 in 2019, according to data obtained by the Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM) under freedom of information laws. A report by the RCEM also found the risk of a 12-hour wait in an emergency department in England increased with the age of the patient. People aged 60 to 69 had a 15% chance of waiting 12 hours or more. For those aged 90 and over, the likelihood rose to 33%. “The healthcare system is failing our most vulnerable patients – more than a million last year,” said Dr Adrian Boyle, the president of the RCEM. “These people are our parents, grandparents, great-grandparents. “They aren’t receiving the level of care they need, as they endure the longest stays in our emergency departments, often suffering degrading and dehumanising corridor care. It’s an alarming threat to patient safety. We know long stays are dangerous, especially for those who are elderly, and puts people’s lives at risk.” As well as long waits, the RCEM report found many older people were missing out on vital checks in A&E. Of patients aged over 75, only 16% were screened for delirium – a reversible condition linked to an increased risk of death. Fewer than half (48%) of patients were screened for their risk of falls. Dr Nick Murch, the president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said: “This situation, where over a million older patients are known to have endured prolonged periods of over 12 hours in emergency departments, frequently in unsuitable and undignified settings such as corridors, is a matter of grave concern. “It is clear that, despite the considerable dedication and hard work of multidisciplinary teams including emergency medicine, acute medicine and acute frailty services, these extended waiting times signify a profound failure within our healthcare system. “We must ensure that 12-hour waits in emergency departments again become an infrequent exception rather than the norm.” The RCEM recommends changes, including “front door frailty screening” in every A&E, which is already being introduced in Scotland. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Boyle said: “It’s the system that’s the issue and will continue to disproportionally affect older people unless governments across the UK make A&E a political priority.” A Department ofHealthand Social Care spokesperson said: “It is unacceptable that older people are waiting up to 12 hours or more in A&E. This government is investing £26bn in the NHS and social care over the next two years, has ended the resident doctor strikes so staff are on the frontline, and is committed to cutting A&E waiting times so patients are seen faster. “Through our 10-year health plan, we will ensure that patients, including older people, are seen promptly in A&E, waiting times continue to come down, and more people get a GP appointment.”",

    "title": "Pharmacists face daily inappropriate demands for antibiotics, survey finds",
    "article_text": "Pharmacists are facing inappropriate demands for antibiotics every day, with some patients stockpiling them for holidays despite the threat posed byantimicrobial resistance, a report says. Staff receive requests for the drugs to treat minor ailments such as coughs and colds even if they are not needed, according to the National Pharmacy Association, which represents 6,000 independent community pharmacies in England. Its survey found 79% of pharmacists were having to refuse requests for antibiotics from patients at least once a day. A quarter of pharmacists said patients frequently returned partially used antibiotics, while 37% were aware of patients regularly hoarding them for a later date. Half-used courses of antibiotics were being posted on local social media groups, the NPA said. Other issues include patients requesting antibiotics from their pharmacy before going on holiday just in case of illness, and people returning from abroad with huge quantities of antibiotics for conditions not treated by them in the UK. Olivier Picard, the chair of the NPA, said: “These are concerning findings and shows there are widespread misconceptions about the role that antibiotics can play among some patients. “Although antibiotics may be an appropriate course of treatment for some conditions, for other ailments like viral coughs and sore throats, they may not be effective. This could also mean antibiotics may not be effective for treating more serious conditions, posing a risk to patient safety. “Pharmacists are highly trained medical professionals who see nearly 2 million patients a day and provide medication advice. They can supply antimicrobials in some circumstances, but only when they are clinically needed.” Diane Ashiru-Oredope, the lead pharmacist for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) at the UKHSA, said addressing public misconceptions about taking antibiotics was an important part of tackling AMR. “Antibiotic resistance is impacting people every day in this country. Not being able to effectively prevent and treat infections is one of the biggest threats to our health,” she said. Overcoming that threatwas still possible if everyone worked together to help keep antibiotics working, she said. “For example, only taking them when prescribed and as directed by a healthcare professional, not taking antibiotics for colds and flu and not saving antibiotics for future use – unused antibiotics can be returned to pharmacies. “Taking action not only protects our own individual health, it also protects everyone in our communities and future generations.” A Department ofHealthand Social Care spokesperson said AMR represented “one of the most significant threats to public health, with potentially devastating consequences if we don’t act now”. “Our pharmacists, along with other healthcare professionals, play a crucial role and we’re grateful for their vigilance in ensuring these vital medicines are only provided when clinically appropriate,” they said.",

    "article_text": "A wildfire has destroyed about 5,000 hectares (12,500 acres) of moorland on Dartmoor inDevon. Emergency services were called to the blaze at about 2.25pm on Sunday, and firefighters spent almost 24 hours at the scene before it was extinguished on Monday. The UK has had the warmest start to May on record, with 29.3C registered on Thursday afternoon at Kew Gardens in south-west London, as firefighters battled a 1.6 mile (2km) moorland blaze that broke out near Ripponden, West Yorkshire the same day. According to the National Fire Chiefs Council, as of 9am on 1 May, fire and rescue services have responded to 439 wildfires since 1 January. That compares with 250 in the same period in 2022, 60 in 2023 and 44 in 2024. People were asked to avoid the Merrivale and Okehampton areas for the time being, and Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service said the fire might behave unpredictably due to the changing weather.Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service posted an update to X on Monday evening saying: “Approximately 12,500 acres of moorland were destroyed by fire. “Crews assisted by Dartmoor rangers and Commoners using firefighting equipment attempted to extinguish the fire to protect the environment. “Crews used five Argo Cat vehicles, fogging units, leaf blowers and a drone.” Dartmoor national park posted a photo of the fire to X on Monday morning, saying: “The dry weather has left Dartmoor highly vulnerable to fire. Please don’t light BBQs or fires.” Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service’s area manager, Simon Young, told the BBC: “Wildfires are always challenging because they are inaccessible for our appliances to go on to our moorland,” he said. “It makes it very difficult, but we have specialist vehicles to make sure we have capability to get on to the moor and make sure we can do the job as safely as possible. “The wind has really played its part and we are currently under amber wildfire conditions nationally for the next three to four days. “We know the conditions are very dry under foot and with the wind it has just exacerbated it.” Meanwhile,SurreyFire and Rescue Service was called to a 1.6 hectare fire in the open at about 12.45pm on Monday on Turfhill, Lightwater in Surrey Heath.",

    "title": "Palestinian author Mosab Abu Toha wins Pulitzer Prize for commentary",
    "article_text": "Palestinian poet Mosab Abu Toha, who has been targeted by pro-Israel groups in the United States for deportation, has won a Pulitzer Prize for commentary. Abu Toha received the prestigious award on Monday for essays published in The New Yorker “on the physical and emotional carnage in Gaza that combine deep reporting with the intimacy of memoir to convey the Palestinian experience” of the war. “I have just won a Pulitzer Prize for Commentary,” Abu Toha wrote on social media. “Let it bring hope. Let it be a tale.” The comment appears to be a tribute to his fellow Palestinian poetRefaat Alareer,was killed in an Israeli attack in Gaza in December 2023. Alareer’s final poem was titled, “If I must die, let it be a tale”. Abu Toha was detained by Israeli forces in Gaza in 2023 before being released to Egypt and subsequently moving to the US. “In the past year, I have lost many of the tangible parts of my memories – the people and places and things that helped me remember,” Abu Toha wrote in one of his New Yorker essays. “I have struggled to create good memories. In Gaza, every destroyed house becomes a kind of album, filled not with photos but with real people, the dead pressed between its pages.” In recent months, right-wing groups in the US have called for deporting Abu Toha amid acampaignby President Donald Trump cracking down non-citizens critical of Israel. The author cancelled events at universities in recent months, citing fears for his safety. I have just won a Pulitzer Prize for Commentary. Let it bring hopeLet it be a talepic.twitter.com/VP6RsPY6vz — Mosab Abu Toha (@MosabAbuToha)May 5, 2025 The Palestinian poet told Al Jazeera’sThe Take podcastin December that the feeling of inability to help people in Gaza has been “devastating”. “Imagine that you are with your parents, with your siblings and their children in a school shelter in Gaza,” Abu Toha said. “You are unable to protect anyone. You are unable to provide them with any food, with any water, with any medicine. But now you are in the United States, the country that is funding the genocide. So, it is heartbreaking.” In other Pulitzer categories, New York Times won prizes for explanatory reporting, local reporting, international coverage and breaking news photography on Monday. With the four awards, the New York-based newspaper received the most prizes from Pulitzer’s 14 journalism contests this year. Winners of the award, named after the Hungarian-American newspaper publisher Joseph Pulitzer, are selected by a board of journalists and academics and announced at Columbia University annually. The New York Times received the international reporting prize for its coverage of theconflict in Sudan, edging out The Washington Post, which was a finalist in the category for its “documented Israeli atrocities” in Gaza, including investigations into the killings of Palestinian medics and journalists. The Post won the breaking news prize for its coverage of the Trumpassassination attemptduring a campaign rally last year. The Reuters news agency took the investigative reporting award for a “boldly reported expose of lax regulation in the US and abroad that makes fentanyl”.",

    "title": "Michigan drops charges against pro-Palestine US student protesters",
    "article_text": "Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has dropped charges against seven student protesters from the University of Michigan, citing legal delays and controversies surrounding the US case, which she said has become a “lightning rod of contention”. The decision on Monday puts an end to the case that started in May 2024 when the students, who pleaded not guilty, were charged with trespassing and resisting a police officer while attending apro-Palestinian campus protest. “We feel vindicated that the case was dismissed,” said Jamil Khuja, a member of the defence team for the students. “These individuals committed no crime whatsoever. They were exercising their right to protest and engage in political speech on public property.” Despite dropping the charges and growing criticism of the case, Nessel on Monday defended her decision to pursue felony charges against the students, saying“a reasonable jury would find the defendants guilty of the crimes alleged”. However, Nessel added in a statement that she dropped the charges nearly a year later because she did not believe “these cases to be a prudent use of my department’s resources”. While hundreds of students were arrested during the wave of pro-Palestine campus encampments that swept the United States last year amidIsrael’s war on Gaza, most were immediately released. The case in Michigan gained national attention and became symbolic of the nationwide crackdown on pro-Palestine demonstrations, with Palestinian rights advocates arguing that the Nessel case was an attack on freedom of speech and assembly. Defence lawyers for the accused had filed motions for Nessel to recuse herself from the case, citing accusations of bias – assertions that the attorney general dismissed as “baseless and absurd”. “These distractions and ongoing delays have created a circus-like atmosphere to these proceedings,” the attorney general said in her statement. Khuja, the defence lawyer, said the team was “absolutely confident” of winning the case, either by judicial dismissal or not-guilty jury verdict, and criticised Nessel’s characterisation of the pretrial proceedings as “circus-like” as untrue. He said requesting Nessel’s removal from the case was warranted, adding that the charges should have been brought by the county and not the state’s attorney general, according to Michigan’s prosecution procedures. To underscore the alleged bias, the defence lawyer also noted that weeks before filing the charges last year, Nessel had clashed with Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, “the only Palestinian in Congress”, for defending the chant “from theriver to the sea, Palestine will be free”, which has been used by student protesters. Soon after Nessel charged the students, Tlaib accused the attorney general of “possible biases” within her agency, underscoring that other protest movements did not face a similar legal crackdown. The attorney general responded byaccusing Tlaibof anti-Semitism, although the congresswoman made no mention of the attorney general’s religion or Jewish identity. “Rashida should not use my religion to imply I cannot perform my job fairly as Attorney General. It’s anti-Semitic and wrong,” Nessel wrote in a social media post in September. The controversy stretched for weeks, with CNN and pro-Israel outlets echoing Nessel’s anti-Semitism allegations against Tlaib without evidence. Khuja said the attorney general ultimately wanted to “make an example out of those protesting for Palestine”. He added that the case was larger than the students and politicians involved. “TheFirst Amendmentapplies to all speech, but it’s been under attack in order to shield Israel from criticism lately,” Khuja told Al Jazeera. “And this case proved that those who believe in Palestinian rights, their views are just as legitimate as anybody else’s, and the First Amendment protects those views and your right to express them.”",

    "title": "Israel bombs Yemen’s Hodeidah port after attack near Tel Aviv",
    "article_text": "The Israeli military says it has carried out air strikes on Yemen’s Hodeidah port and a cement factory, claiming the sites were used to supportHouthi operations against Israel. The strikes on Monday injured at least 21 people, the Houthi-run health ministry spokesman Anees al-Asbahi said. According to the Israeli army, fighter jets struck infrastructure linked to the Houthis, including a cement factory east of Hodeidah that it described as “an important economic resource” used in building tunnels and military infrastructure. “The Hodeidah seaport serves as a hub for the transfer of Iranian weapons and equipment for military needs,” the Israeli army said in a statement. The claim could not be independently verified. Houthi-run Al Masirah TV reported that six Israeli strikes hit Hodeidah’s port and blamed both Israel and the United States. Axios journalist Barak Ravid quoted a senior US official who said the air raids were coordinated between Israel and the US. A US defence source told Al Jazeera that “US forces did not participate in the Israeli strikes on Yemen today” but did not deny nonlethal support may have been provided. The attack was carried out after a ballistic missile fired from Yemen on Sunday struck close to Ben Gurion International Airport outside Tel Aviv. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hadpledged retaliationfor the Houthi attack, the first known missile to avoid interception since the Yemeni group began targeting Israel in November 2023. Al Jazeera correspondent Ali Hashem reported that about 30 Israeli warplanes took part in Monday’s operation, which was overseen by Netanyahu and Defence Minister Israel Katz from a command centre in Tel Aviv. Hashem said the strikes mark a “new phase” in Israeli attacks on Yemen. Since US President Donald Trump returned to power in January, the US has embarked on a more aggressive assault on Yemen “which is related directly to Israeli interests”, Hashem added. This is not the first time Israel has bombed targets in Yemen. In December, air raids struck the Ras Isa oil terminal and other sites in Hodeidah province,killing at least nine people. While most Houthi-launched projectiles have been intercepted, Sunday’s attack was the “most significant strike”, Hashem said, since the group launched its campaign in November 2023, which it said is in response to Israel’s war on Gaza and to show solidarity with Palestinians. A drone had previously hit a building in Tel Aviv last year. Since November 2023, the Houthis, also known as Ansar Allah, have launched more than 100 drone and missile attacks targeting vessels they said are linked to Israel in the Red Sea. Although the Houthis paused attacks during a ceasefire in Gaza this year, they resumed their operations in March after Israel cut off humanitarian aid to Gaza and resumed its offensive.",

    "title": "Romania’s PM resigns after far right wins first round of presidential vote",
    "article_text": "Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu has resigned, a day after a far-right opposition leaderwon the first roundof the presidential election rerun and his own candidate crashed out of the race. Ciolacu said on Monday that his centre-left Social Democratic Party (PSD) would withdraw from thepro-Western coalition– effectively ending it – while cabinet ministers will stay on in an interim capacity until a new majority emerges after the presidential run-off. Hard-right eurosceptic George Simion decisively swept the ballot on Sunday, with some 41 percent of votes, and will face Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan, an independent centrist, in a May 18 run-off. Coalition candidate Crin Antonescu came third. “Rather than let the future president replace me, I decided to resign myself,” Ciolacu said. Although Ciolacu’s leftist PSD won the most seats in a December 1 parliamentary election, Simion’s Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) and two other far-right groupings, one with overt pro-Russian sympathies, won more than a third of the seats to become a clear political force. The Social Democrats had formed a coalition government with the centrist Liberals and ethnic Hungarian UDMR to help keep the European Union and NATO state on a pro-Western course. A governing majority that cordons off the far-right in the legislature cannot be formed without it. “This coalition is no longer legitimate,” Ciolacu told reporters after a party meeting. Before the meeting, Ciolacu stated that one of the conditions of forming the coalition was to field a common candidate to win the presidency. Romania already has an interim president until the May 18 run-off. The country has the EU’s largest budget deficit and risks a ratings downgrade to below investment level unless it enforces a decisive fiscal correction. Sunday’s vote came five months after a first attempt to hold the election was cancelled because of alleged Russian interference in favour of far-right frontrunner Calin Georgescu, sincebanned from standing again. Simion has said he could appoint Georgescu prime minister should he win. The vote underscores simmering anger among vast parts of the Romanian electorate over high living costs and worries over security. Some analysts think a Simion victory could isolate Romania, erode private investment and destabilise NATO’s eastern flank, where Bucharest plays a key role in providing logistical support to Ukraine as it fights a three-year-old Russian invasion, political observers say. It would also expand a cohort of eurosceptic leaders in the EU that already includes the Hungarian and Slovak prime ministers at a time when Europe is struggling to formulate its response to United States President Donald Trump. Simion said in a prerecorded speech aired after polls closed Sunday that, “I am here to restore constitutional order.” “I want democracy, I want normalcy, and I have a single objective: to give back to the Romanian people what was taken from them and to place at the centre of decision-making the ordinary, honest, dignified people,” he said. Simion said his hard-right nationalist AUR party is “perfectly aligned with the MAGA movement”, referring to Trump’s“Make America Great Again” campaign and capitalising on a growing wave of populism in Europe after the US president’s political comeback. AUR, which proclaims to stand for “family, nation, faith, and freedom”, rose to prominence in a 2020 parliamentary election and has doubled its support since then.",

    "title": "Trump hails ‘productive’ call with Turkiye’s Erdogan as visits planned",
    "article_text": "United States President Donald Trump says he has had a “very good and productive” telephone conversation with his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and they have discussed a wide range of topics, including how to end Russia’s war in Ukraine, Syria andIsrael’s war on Gaza. During the call on Monday, Trump said Erdogan had invited him to visit Turkiye and he had extended an invitation for the Turkish leader to visit Washington, DC. No dates were announced. A readout of the call from the Turkish presidency confirmed Erdogan invited Trump for a visit. The Republican president, who described his relationship with Erdogan as “excellent” during his first tenure at the White House, said the two countries would cooperate on ending thewar in Ukraine. “I look forward to working with President Erdogan on getting the ridiculous but deadly, War between Russia and Ukraine ended – NOW!” Trump said in a post on Truth Social, his social media platform. NATO member Turkiye has sought tomaintain good relationswith both of its Black Sea neighbours since the Russian invasion of Ukraine and has twice hosted talks aimed at ending the war. “Noting that he supports President Trump’s approach toward ending wars, President Erdogan expressed appreciation for the efforts exerted to maintain the negotiation process with Iran and stop the war between Russia and Ukraine,” Turkiye’s Directorate of Communications said in a statement posted on X. Erdogan also raised the urgent need for a ceasefire in Gaza, warning that its humanitarian crisis had reached a “grave level”, the directorate said. The Turkish president also stressed the importance of the “uninterrupted delivery of humanitarian aid and the urgent end to this tragic situation”. On neighbouring Syria, Erdogan reaffirmed Turkiye’s commitment to preserving its territorial integrity and restoring lasting stability. He said US efforts to ease sanctions on Syria and its new government would help move that process forward and contribute to regional peace. Regarding bilateral ties, Erdogan said Ankara remained committed to strengthening cooperation with Washington, particularly in the defence sector. Trump is due to visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates next week.",

    "title": "US bill to ban Israel boycotts faces right-wing backlash over free speech",
    "article_text": "Washington, DC –A bill in the United States Congress that aims to further penalise the boycotting of countries friendly to the US is facing opposition from allies of PresidentDonald Trumpover free speech concerns, putting its passage in jeopardy. According to Republican CongresswomanMarjorie Taylor Greene, a vote in the House of Representatives on the proposal, previously scheduled for Monday, has been cancelled. Although Trump’s Republican Party has been leading legislative efforts to crack down onboycotts of Israel, over the past days, several conservatives close to the US president voiced opposition to the bill, dubbed the International Governmental Organization (IGO) Anti-Boycott Act. “It is my job to defend American’s [sic] rights to buyor boycottwhomever they choose without the government harshly fining them or imprisoning them,” Greene said in a social media post on Monday. “But what I don’t understand is why we are voting on a bill on behalf of other countries and not the President’s executive orders that are FOR OUR COUNTRY???” Charlie Kirk, a prominent right-wing activist and commentator, also said that the bill should not pass. “In America you are allowed to hold differing views. You are allowed to disagree and protest,” Kirk wrote on X on Sunday. “We’ve allowed far too many people who hate America move here from abroad, but the right to speak freely is the birthright of all Americans.” Steve Bannon, a formerTrump adviserand influential right-wing media personality, backed the comments of Kirk and Greene, writing on the social media platform Gettr, “Fact check: True” and “Agreed” in response to their statements, respectively. The proposed legislation was introduced by pro-Israel hawks in the US Congress, Republican Mike Lawler and Democrat Josh Gottheimer, in January, and has been co-sponsored by 22 other lawmakers from both major parties. The bill would expand a 2018 law that bans coercive boycotts imposed by foreign governments to include international governmental organisations (IGOs). The original legislation prohibits boycotting a country friendly to the US based on an “agreement with, a requirement of, or a request from or on behalf” of another nation. It imposes penalties of up to $1m and 20 years in prison for violations. Expanding the legislation to include IGOs risks penalising individuals and companies in the US that boycott firms listed bythe United Nationsas doing business in illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. While the bill itself does not explicitly mention Israel, its drafters have said that it targets the UN and the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) Movement, which calls for economic pressure on the Israeli government to end its abuses against Palestinians. “This change targets harmful and inherently anti-Semitic BDS efforts at IGOs, such as the UN, by extending protections already in place for boycotts instigated by foreign countries,” Lawler’s office said in January. States and the federal government have been passing anti-BDS laws for years, raising the alarm about the violation of free speech rights, which are guaranteed by the First Amendment of the US Constitution. Numerous legal cases have challenged these laws, and some judges have ruled that they are unconstitutional, while others haveupheld them. Rights groups and Palestinian rights advocates have argued that anti-boycott laws aim to shut down the debate about Israel and criminalise peaceful resistance against its violations of international law. Over the years, leading UN agencies and rights groups, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, have accused Israel of war crimes and crimes against humanity, includingimposing apartheidon Palestinians. But supporters of anti-BDS laws say the measures are designed to combat discrimination against Israel and regulate trade, not speech. Such laws have mainly faced opposition from progressive Democrats, but the IGO Anti-Boycott Act has generated anger from right-wing politicians, too. “Americans have the right to boycott, and penalizing this risks free speech. I reject and vehemently condemn antisemitism but I cannot violate the first amendment,” Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, a Florida Republican, wrote on X. I agree with@RepMTG.I’ll be voting No on this bill as well.https://t.co/YOPga59Xyc — Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie)May 4, 2025 The right-wing rejection of the Lawler-Gottheimer bill comes as the Trump administration continues with its push to target criticism of and protests against Israel, especially on college campuses. Since Trump took office, the US government has revoked the visas of hundreds of students for activism against Israel’swar on Gaza. Several students, including legal permanent residents, have been jailed over allegations of anti-Semitism and “spreading Hamas propaganda”. Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish graduate student at Tufts University, has been detained since March, and the only known allegation against her is co-authoring an op-ed calling on her college to honour the student senate’s call for divesting from Israeli companies. Trump has also frozen and threatened to freeze federal funding for several universities,including Harvard, over pro-Palestine protests.",

    "title": "US offers $1,000 stipend to migrants who self-deport",
    "article_text": "The administration of US President Donald Trump says it is going to pay $1,000 to undocumented immigrants in the United States who return to their home countries voluntarily as it pushes forward with its plans formass deportations. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a news release on Monday that it’s also paying for travel assistance and people who use an app called CBP Home to tell the government they plan to return home will be “deprioritized” for detention and removal byimmigration enforcement. “If you are here illegally, self-deportation is the best, safest and most cost-effective way to leave the United States to avoid arrest. DHS is now offering illegal aliens financial travel assistance and a stipend to return to their home country through the CBP Home App,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said. The stipend and airfare for people who voluntarily depart would cost less than an actual deportation, the agency said. The average cost of arresting, detaining and deporting someone without legal status is currently about $17,000, according to the DHS. Trump took office in January pledging to deport millions of people but so far has trailed deportations under his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden. Biden’s administration faced high levels of undocumented immigration and quickly returned many people caught crossing the border. The Trump administration has deported 152,000 people since it took office on January 20, according to the DHS, lower than the 195,000 deported from February to April last year under Biden. Trump’s administration has tried to encourage migrants and asylum seekers to leave voluntarily by threatening steep fines, trying to strip away legal status, and deporting people to prisons in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and El Salvador. Trump previewed the stipend plan in April, saying the US would consider allowing migrants and asylum seekers to return. “If they’re good, if we want them back in, we’re going to work with them to get them back in as quickly as we can,” he said. In the announcement on Monday, the DHS said people who choose to leave “may help preserve” the ability to return legally but did not cite any specific pathway or programme.",

    "article_text": "Three police officers have been killed and at least four others injured after gunmen opened fire on traffic police in southern Russia’s Republic of Dagestan, according to regional authorities. The attack took place on Monday in the capital, Makhachkala, when police attempted to stop a car, Dagestan leader Sergei Melikov said. The shooting began at about 14:20 local time (11:20 GMT), the Interior Ministry confirmed. Two assailants were shot dead at the scene. Local officials identified the men, both born in 2000, but did not say how many others were involved. State media reported that additional attackers fled in a vehicle, prompting a wider manhunt. Footage circulating on Telegram, verified by the Reuters news agency, showed bodies lying on the road beside a police car. Gunshots could be heard in the background as onlookers gathered at the scene. At least two other attackers, alongside injured officers and civilians – including a 17-year-old girl – were taken to hospital. One later died, state media reported. Officials have launched a criminal investigation. Dagestan, a majority-Muslim region bordering the Caspian Sea, has witnessed a number of deadly attacks in recent years. In March, Russian security forces said they killed four alleged ISIL (ISIS) fighters who were planning to attack a local Interior Ministry office. The latest violence in Dagestan follows a separate security operation last week, when Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) claimed to have killed a man suspected of planning bombings on the Moscow metro and a Jewish religious site in the capital region. In June 2024, at least 20 people were killed after armed men attacked a synagogue, churches and police in theDagestanregion. That attack came three months after at least 133 people were killed in a March 2024 attack on a concert in Moscow’s Crocus City Hall. While the Afghanistan-basedISIL affiliate in Khorasan Province (ISKP)claimed responsibility for the worst attack to hit Russia in years, Moscow at the timeclaimedwithout evidence that Ukraine had a played role. Though both Russia and the United States declared the territorial defeat of ISIL (ISIS) in Iraq and Syria by 2019, offshoots of the group – especially ISKP – have re-emerged, posing renewed threats across Europe, Central Asia and the Middle East.",

    "title": "Fear and intimidation at Newark airport",
    "article_text": "I am no stranger to political repression and censorship. I have lived in Germany for five years now, and as a Palestinian journalist involved in pro-Palestinian advocacy, I have experienced repeated harassment at the hands of the German authorities. My husband, a German citizen, and I, an American citizen, have grown accustomed to being held for hours at a time, subjected to invasive interrogations about our travels, and having our belongings thoroughly searched without clear justification. But we were shocked to find out that these tactics, designed to intimidate and deter, have now been taken up by the United States to target Palestinians amid the ongoing genocide. I always knew that citizenship offered only limited protection, especially when dissent is involved. But deep down, I still believed that freedom of speech, the right to speak without fear, meant something in my country of birth. I was wrong. The harassment we endured on March 24 upon arriving in the US shattered that illusion. Our Palestinian identity, our political work, our family ties – all of it makes us permanent targets, not just in Germany, but now in the US, too. Prior to departure, while we were at our gate in Frankfurt airport, four agents approached me and identified themselves as officers from the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS). They said they were specifically looking for my husband, who had just stepped aside to buy water and juice for our sons. “We just want to make sure your ESTA visa is in order,” one of them said. They took his passport, flipping through it and photographing every single page while one of them stayed on the phone, relaying information. They asked about our visit to Gaza in 2022, after seeing the Rafah border stamp. “Where did you go in Gaza?” one agent asked.“Khan Younis,” my husband replied.“Where does your family live now?”“All over,” he said. “They’re living in tents across the Strip, you know, because of the war.”“What did you do while you were there?”“Visited family,” he answered. It was clear we were targeted. I did not see any other passengers undergoing a similar check. This meant that either DHS was actively researching passengers before their departure to the US, or – even more troubling – the German authorities were communicating directly with DHS to flag the background and political activity of “suspect” travellers. Upon arrival at Newark airport in New Jersey, my husband and I were separated and individually interrogated, each of us still holding a sleeping child. The men questioning us did not identify themselves; I believe they were DHS agents, not border police. They first asked me about the purpose of my trip and my travel to Gaza. They wanted to know who I had met in Gaza, why I had met them, and whether anyone I encountered was affiliated with Hamas. At one point, an officer deliberately became ambiguous and instead of referencing Hamas, asked if “anyone from [my] family was a part of the government in Gaza”. At one point, they asked whether I experienced violence from Israeli soldiers, to which I responded: “Israeli soldiers weren’t in Gaza in 2022.” “Did anyone in your family experience violence during this war?”“Yes,” I responded. “Fifty were killed.”“Were any of them Hamas supporters?” was the response I received. As if political affiliation could justify the incineration of a family. As if children, elders, mothers, reduced to numbers, must first be interrogated for their loyalties before their deaths can be acknowledged. They knew I was a journalist, so they demanded to know the last article I had written and where it was published. I told them that it was a piece for Mondoweiss about the abduction of Mahmoud Khalil, in which I also warned about the dangers of the Trump administration’s policies. This seemed to heighten their scrutiny. They demanded my email address, my social media accounts, and jotted down my phone number without explanation. Then they took our phones. When I asked what would happen if I refused, they made it clear I had no choice. If I did not comply, my phone would still be taken from me, and if my husband did not comply, he would be deported. When they finally returned our electronics, they issued a chilling warning to my husband: “You have been here seven times without an issue. Stay away from political activity, and everything will be fine.” Subsequently, I was advised by legal counsel not to attend any demonstrations, not even by myself, during our stay. Our movements, our words, and even our silences were under watch, and anything could be used against us. What happened to us was not random; it was intentional. It was meant to scare and intimidate us. Whether it is in Germany, in the US, or elsewhere, the goal of these tactics is the same: to make us feel small, isolated, criminalised, and afraid. They want us to doubt the worth of every word we write, to question every protest we join, to swallow every truth before it reaches our lips. They want us to forget the people we have lost. Fifty members of our family were murdered in the US-backed genocide in Gaza. Fifty souls, each with their own dreams, laughter, and love, extinguished under the roar of bombs and the silence of the world. Our family’s story is no different from thousands of others – stories that vanish from headlines but live forever in the hearts of the survivors. They expect us to carry this unbearable weight quietly, to bow our heads and continue living as if our world were not ripped apart. But we do not bow. And that is why they fear us; they fear a people who refuse to disappear. Palestinians who dare to speak, to organise, to simply bear witness are marked as dangerous. I was warned that speaking about our experience at the airport would make the next encounter even harsher, even more punishing. But we must remember: there is nothing this state can do to us that can compare to what is being done to the people of Gaza. Our passports are only paper. Our phones are only metal and glass. These are things they can confiscate, things they can break. But they cannot take away our voices, our memories, and our commitment to justice. On our way out, the officers asked my husband one last question: “What do you think of Hamas? Are they good?” He responded: “My concern is fighting a genocide that has taken the lives and freedom of my family and my people. Anything else, I am not interested in answering.” That should be all of our concern. Nothing should distract us from the urgent, undeniable truth: a people are being slaughtered, and our responsibility is to stand with them.

    "title": "‘Scientific asylum’: How Europe is luring US researchers amid Trump fears",
    "article_text": "French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are hosting a conference in Paris to attract United States-based academics and researchers in the wake of US President Donald Trump’s targeting of universities. European Union commissioners on Monday announced half a billion euros ($568m) in incentives to lure international academics to the continent at the Choose Europe for Science conference. The meeting at Paris’s Sorbonne University is targeted at academics and researchers who fear their work will be threatened by billions of dollars ofUS government spending cutsfor universities and research bodies as well as attacks on higher education institutions overdiversity policiesandpro-Palestinian demonstrations. Pro-Palestinian foreign students in the US have been arrested and sent to detention centres, often without following due process, while universities have been pressured to punish professors speaking out against the Gaza war. Campaigners said the Trump administration’s actions, including revocations of permanent resident status of students, have a chilling effect on academic freedom – a cornerstone of the American education system. Trump’s campaign against universities has given Europe’s political leaders hope they could reap an intellectual windfall. Macron’s office said the EU is targeting researchers working in the fields of health, climate, biodiversity, artificial intelligence and space. For her part, von der Leyen said she wanted EU member states to invest 3 percent of their gross domestic products in research and development by 2030. US universities and research facilities have come under increasing political pressure under Trump, including threats of federal funding cuts. Trump has pushed universities to punish pro-Palestine protesters and ordered them to drop diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) measures aimed at providing better representation for minority and poorly served communities. Trump and his voter base have accused US universities of promoting progressive ideology over conservative values. They say the universities have failed to protect the civil rights of conservative and Jewish students. On April 14, Harvard University rejected a series of demands from the Trump administration. Within hours, the US Department of Education froze nearly$2.3bnin federal funding for the Ivy League institution. Last week, Trump renewed his threat to strip Harvard of itstax-exempt status, a move that could cost the university billions of dollars if implemented. Harvard has described the president’s move as “leverage to gain control of academic decision-making”. The university in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has sued the administration. On March 10, the Department of Education announced it hadsent letters to 60higher education institutions, warning them of “enforcement actions” if they did not protect Jewish students on campus as stipulated in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. In February, the Trump administration froze $400m in funds for Columbia University in New York City, which emerged as the epicentre of last year’s protests against Israel’s war on Gaza. Some universities have also received “stop work” orders – calls to suspend research projects funded by the government. Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, said it had received more than 75 “stop work” orders from the US Department of Defense, according to a statement released by Cornell President Michael I Kotlikoff on April 8. Elsewhere, hundreds of international students and recent graduates have had theirUS visas revoked– some have even been arrested – for participating in pro-Palestine demonstrations. The Trump administration is also sharpening its attacks on the National Science Foundation, the government agency that funds basic science, maths and engineering research, especially at colleges and universities. On May 2, the White House made apreliminary budget requestto cut $4.7bn, or more than half of the agency’s $9bn budget. It follows two previous waves of grant cancellations in April as well as funding cuts to other public bodies. In the wake of Trump’s moves, the EU is hoping to offer a political safe haven for US scientists and academics and also to “defend our [the EU’s] strategic interests and promote a universalist vision”, an official in Macron’s office told the AFP news agency. Monday’s conference in Paris is the latest push to open Europe’s doors to US-based researchers. In April, Macron appealed to US university staff to “choose France” and unveiled plans for a funding programme to cover the costs of bringing foreign scientists to the country. “We were quite indignant about what was happening, and we felt that our colleagues in the US were going through a catastrophe. … We wanted to offer some sort of scientific asylum to those whose research is being hindered,” Eric Berton, the president of France’s Aix-Marseille University, told the UK-based Guardian newspaper. The European Research Council, an EU body that finances scientific work, told the Reuters news agency that it would double its relocation budget to fund researchers moving to the EU to 2 million euros ($2.16m) per applicant. The UK government is preparing a similar initiative. Backed by about 50 million pounds ($66m) in state funding, the scheme is designed to support research grants and cover relocation expenses for select teams of scientists, mainly from the US. In Germany, as part of coalition talks for a new government, conservatives and Social Democrats have drawn up plans to lure up to 1,000 researchers, according to negotiation documents from March seen by Reuters that allude to the upheaval in US higher learning. “The American government is currently using brute force against the universities in the USA, so that researchers from America are now contacting Europe,” Germany’s chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, said in April. “This is a huge opportunity for us.” For decades, Europe has lagged behind the US when it comes to investment in higher education. According to Eurostat, the EU’s statistical office, total expenditures on research and development in the EU among businesses, governments and universities was 381 billion euros ($411bn) in 2023. That same year, total research and development in the US was estimated at $940bn, according to the National Centre for Science and Engineering Statistics, a federal data agency. And the wealthiest US university, Harvard, has an endowment worth $53.2bn while that of Britain’s (and Europe’s) wealthiest, the University of Oxford, is $10.74bn. “I don’t foresee a rapid build-up of additional scientific capability that could match what the US now has … for several decades,” Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University in New Jersey, recently told Reuters. Some US scientists have pointed to what they see as another drawback – European language barriers and unfamiliar laws and employment practices. In addition, research funding and researchers’ remuneration both lag far behind US levels. The Choose Europe for Science event is expected to counter those concerns by arguing that university pay gaps will seem less significant when the lower cost of education, healthcare and more generous social benefits are taken into account. Aix-Marseille University in the south of France said it has received interest from 120 researchers at institutions across the US, including NASA and Stanford University in California, in the 15-million-euro ($17m) “safe space for science” programme it launched on March 7. The initiative aims to attract US researchers from fields including health, medicine, epidemiology and climate change. In a letter to French universities in March, Philippe Baptiste, France’s minister for higher education and research, wrote: “Many well-known researchers are already questioning their future in the United States. We would naturally wish to welcome a certain number of them.” Elsewhere, the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London, which specialises in climate change research, has created two fellowships for early career climate researchers from the US and has already seen an uptick in applications. An official from Macron’s office said Monday’s conference is being held “at a time when academic freedoms are retreating and under threat in a number of cases and Europe is a continent of attractiveness”. Still, Europe is not immune from controversy.Germanyhas been accused ofsilencing pro-Palestinian voices, having recently ordered the deportations of three European nationals and a US citizen over“anti-Semitic” actions.",

    "title": "ICJ dismisses Sudan’s genocide case alleging UAE backing of RSF rebels",
    "article_text": "The top United Nations court has dismissed a case brought by Sudan accusing the United Arab Emirates (UAE) of breaching the UN Genocide Convention by arming and funding the rebel paramilitary Rapid Support Forces inSudan’s deadly civil war. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) said on Monday that it “manifestly lacked” the authority to continue the proceedings and threw out the case. While both Sudan and the UAE are signatories to the 1948 Genocide Convention, the UAE has a carveout to the part of the treaty that gives The Hague-based court jurisdiction. In March, Sudan asked the ICJ for several orders, known as provisional measures, including telling the UAE to do all it can to prevent the killing and other crimes targeting the Masalit people in Darfur. The UAE called the filing apublicity stuntand, in a hearing last month, argued the court had no jurisdiction. The court on Monday agreed with the UAE’s arguments, rejected Sudan’s request for emergency measures and ordered the case be removed from its docket. Due to the lack of jurisdiction, “the court is precluded by its statute from taking any position on the merits of the claims made by Sudan”, a summary of the ruling said. The UAE hailed it as a legal victory. “This decision is a clear and decisive affirmation of the fact that this case was utterly baseless. The court’s finding that it is without jurisdiction confirms that this case should never have been brought,” Reem Ketait, deputy assistant minister for political affairs at the UAE’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in a statement. “The facts speak for themselves: the UAE bears no responsibility for the conflict in Sudan. On the contrary, the atrocities committed by the warring parties are well-documented.” In an earlier statement, Ketait insisted the UAE “is not involved in the war”. By a 14-to-two vote, the court threw out Sudan’s request for emergency measures to prevent genocidal acts against the Masalit tribe, which has been the focus of intense ethnic-based attacks by the RSF. Sudan descended into a deadly conflict in mid-April 2023 when long-simmering tensions between its military and rival paramilitary forces broke out in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to other regions. Both the Rapid Support Forces and Sudan’s military have been accused of abuses as they battle each other. The UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula and an ally of the United States, has been repeatedly accused of arming the RSF, something it has strenuously denied despiteevidence to the contrary.",

    "title": "How RSF is adopting Israel’s ‘template for genocide’ in Sudan",
    "article_text": "On April 11, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) stormed the Zamzam displacement camp in Sudan’s North Darfur, burning huts and shops, executing medics, and firing at fleeing civilians. According to monitors, at least 500 people – men, women, children and the elderly – were killed, and hundreds of thousands were forcibly displaced. The attack provoked global outrage, prompting the RSF to double down on propaganda it had been spreading for months about Zamzam – that it was actually a military barracks. “Zamzam was a military zone … so the RSF decided that we should evacuate civilians,” RSF adviser Ali Musabel told Al Jazeera, without providing evidence for his claim. “We didn’t want civilians to get caught in the crossfire.” By labelling Zamzam a military zone, the RSF was trying to apply the same model Israel uses to justify bombing hospitals and schools in the Gaza Strip, said Rifaat Makawi, a Sudanese human rights lawyer. “This is not a coincidence: it is a deliberate practice aimed at stripping civilians of their legal protection by labelling them as combatants or instruments of war,” he told Al Jazeera. Throughout Sudan’s civil war, the RSF has used human rights jargon and terms from international humanitarian law (IHL) – the legal framework designed to protect civilians in times of war – to carry out atrocities. For years, Israel employed this practice in an attempt to ward off criticism for killing and oppressing Palestinians, according to legal scholars. Since launching its genocidal war on Gaza on October 7, 2023, it has doubled down. It claims hospitals in Gaza are Hamas “control-and-command centres” – trying to justify attacking health facilities, which are protected under IHL. It also claims Hamas hides among civilians to use them as “human shields” to justify disproportionate and intentional attacks against those same civilians. In addition, it has branded its mass expulsions of civilians as “humanitarian” evacuations, giving people hours to pack up their entire lives and get out of the way of Israeli bombs, if they can. Israel stands accused of genocide by rights groups and United Nations experts for its war that has killed at least 52,567 Palestinians. And the RSF is increasingly adopting Israel’s strategy, local monitors and legal experts say. “The fact that the claims made by the RSF in Sudan resemble the claims Israel is making in Gaza … reveals the emergence of a template to commit mass extermination and even genocide,” said Luigi Daniele, a senior lecturer on IHL at Nottingham Law School. The UN accuses both sides in Sudan’s war of committing grave crimes, such as killing and torturing prisoners of war, since a power struggle between the RSF and the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) erupted into an all-out civil war in April 2023. Human rights groups accuse the RSF of perpetrating additional atrocities, including carrying out a possible genocide against the “non-Arab” communities in Darfur. The RSF emerged from the nomadic “Arab” militias in Darfur, which became known as the Janjaweed (devils on horseback in Sudanese Arabic) for the countless atrocities they committed. The army used the Janjaweed to crush a rebellion by sedentary farming “non-Arab” communities that started in 2003. The sedentary communities were protesting against their political and economic marginalisation in Sudan. SAF and RSF were closely aligned until at least 2021, when they came together to overthrow the civilian administration with which they had been sharing power after a popular uprising toppled autocratic President Omar al-Bashir in 2019. Shortly after the coup, the RSF signed a memorandum of understanding with the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) to receive human rights training. Now, the RSF and its political allies are using human rights terminology to try to whitewash their atrocities. On March 8, an RSF-backed political alliance, Tasis (Foundation), tweeted: “We stand in solidarity with Sudanese women in their recent ordeal, where they have faced particularly tragic conditions and been subjected to horrific violations, as a result of the unjust war.” Tasis made no mention of the reports published by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, which accuse the RSF of widespread sexual violence and rape throughout the war. During the raid on Zamzam, the RSF reportedly abducted 25 women and girls and raped others, according to the Strategic Initiative for Women in the Horn of Africa, a local monitor documenting sexual violence in the region. “What I see today in Darfur, and specifically in Zamzam, is not merely a violation of the IHL, but evidence of its distortion and transformation into a cover under which the gravest crimes are committed,” human rights lawyer Makawi told Al Jazeera. The Zamzam camp sprang up in 2003, 15km (9.3 miles) from North Darfur’s capital, el-Fasher, to shelter “non-Arab” Zaghawa and Fur communities, which fled Popular Defence Forces’ violence during the first Darfur war. Both communities suffered genocidal levels of violence and were expelled from their lands by the state-backed Janjaweed. Zamzam soon became a symbol of the atrocities they endured. Some 350,000 people settled in the camp, swelling to more than half a million as the RSF and the army went to war andthe paramilitary group capturedSouth, East, West and Central Darfur states in late 2023. In April 2024, the RSF besieged el-Fasher and surrounding towns after the Joint Forces – a coalition of “non-Arab” armed groups formed to fight the government in the past – shed their neutrality and sided with the army. Given the RSF’s track record of enmity towards “non-Arab” ethnic groups, the Joint Forces feared widespread ethnic killings if the RSF captured the entire state. The RSF blocked aid from anyone not aligned with them, leading to famine in Zamzam. Ascivilians withered away from hunger,the RSF began claiming that Zamzam was a “military base”, revealing its intention to attack. “This claim that there was a military base in Zamzam was never correct … we had some people who acted as a police force, but there were no military leaders in the camp,” said Mosab, a middle-aged man who survived the killing in Zamzam and now languishes in the nearby town of Tawila. Musabel, the RSF adviser, told Al Jazeera that the high civilian death toll was due to the Joint Forces using “human shields”, without providing evidence. The RSF has also mimicked the Israeli tactic of carrying out mass expulsions under a humanitarian guise. Since October 7, 2023, Israel has pushed 2.3 million Palestinians intosmaller and smaller pockets of land, which it describes as “safe zones” in Gaza. Israel bombs or invades those areas, claiming they “became military targets” due to the ostensible presence of someone from Hamas there. “What Israel has done in Gaza, in reality, has been issuing mass expulsion orders under threats of extermination, which is a declaration of intent to commit international crimes,” Nottingham Law School’s Daniele said. On April 11, Tasis posted on Facebook, calling for civilians to flee Zamzam through what it called “humanitarian corridors” leading to nearby towns such as Tawila and Korma. Yet on April 27, an RSF commander was seen announcing the detention of a group of unarmed men who fled Zamzam through a supposed humanitarian corridor to Tawila, in a video verified by Al Jazeera’s authentication unit, Sanad. He said the men had sided against their Darfuri brethren and with the traditional elite, represented in the “Arab” Jalaba tribes who live in central and northern Sudan and comprise much of Sudan’s military and political elite. He added that they might kill the detained men to serve as an example to others. The RSF has framed its war against the army as a fight on behalf of peripheral tribes against the central elite, while at the same time committing egregious abuses against the most marginalised tribes in Darfur. The detainees were relief workers, according to local monitors, who fear they were killed. Al Jazeera was unable to confirm their fate. Survivors told Al Jazeera that the RSF had carried out ethnic cleansing, possibly amounting to several war crimes. “Some of us were executed [by the RSF] along [the road out of Zamzam] and others were violently displaced,” said Mohamed Idriss*, who walked for 13 hours before arriving in el-Fasher. “We were exposed to so many violations, [the RSF] committed massacres and ethnic cleansing,” he told Al Jazeera.",

    "title": "AfD sues over ‘extremist’ classification; Germany rejects US criticism",
    "article_text": "TheAlternative for Germany(AfD) has launched a legal challenge against Germany’s domestic intelligence agency for designating the far-right party an “extremist” organisation. A spokesperson for the administrative court in Cologne confirmed on Monday that the AfD had submitted both a lawsuit and an emergency petition in response to the decision by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV). Germany, meanwhile, hit back at President Donald Trump’s administration in the United States over its criticism of the classification, suggesting officials in Washington should study history. The Cologne court will begin reviewing the case once the BfV confirms that it has been notified of the filings. The AfD had earlier denounced the designation as a politically driven attempt to marginalise the party. “With our lawsuit, we are sending a clear signal against the abuse of state power to combat and exclude the opposition,” party co-leaders Tino Chrupalla and Alice Weidel said on Monday, alleging that the classification was an effort to “distort democratic competition and delegitimise millions of votes”. The classification, announced on Friday, gives Germany’s intelligence agency the power to surveil the AfD, the largest opposition party in parliament. These powers include deploying informants and intercepting internal party communications. A 1,100-page report compiled by the agency – that will not be made public – concluded that the AfD is a racist and anti-Muslim organisation. The move came at a pivotal moment in German politics as the mainstream grapples with the continued rise of the far right. Centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) leader Friedrich Merz is expected to be sworn in as chancellor on Tuesday after his party struck acoalition dealwith the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD). The agreement was driven by a longstanding understanding among mainstream parties to sideline far-right political forces. The AfD came second to the CDU in February’s snap elections. The SPD finished third. SPD leader Lars Klingbeil said last week that the coalition would review the situation to decide whether to revive efforts to ban the AfD. The new government will also have to deal with criticism from abroad over Germany’s approach to the AfD, in particular from the governments of the US and Russia, both of which are swift to condemn any “foreign interference” in their own affairs. US Vice President JD Vance, who met with Weidel after the elections in February, insisted on Friday that the AfD was “by far the most representative” party in the formerly communist eastern Germany, adding: “Now the bureaucrats try to destroy it.” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio branded the designation of the party “tyranny in disguise”. In response, Germany’s Federal Foreign Office posted on Monday, “This is democracy,” and said the decision was “the result of a thorough & independent investigation to protect our Constitution & the rule of law”. The ministry said independent courts will have the final say, adding: “We have learnt from our history that rightwing extremism needs to be stopped.” The Kremlin also weighed in to criticise the action against the AfD, which regularly repeats Russian narratives regarding the war in Ukraine, and what it called a broader trend of “restrictive measures” against political movements in Europe.",

    "title": "Inter vs Barcelona – UEFA Champions League: Start time, team news, lineups",
    "article_text": "Who:Inter Milan vs BarcelonaWhat:UEFA Champions League semifinal, second legWhere:San Siro stadium, Milan, ItalyWhen:Tuesday at 9pm (19:00 GMT) Follow Al Jazeera Sport’s livetext and photo commentary stream. Five-time UEFA Champions League winners Barcelona travel to northern Italy to play three-time title holders Inter Milan in a tantalising second and deciding leg of their semifinal on Tuesday night. The Catalan Giants remain on track for a rare treble – LaLiga, Copa del Rey and Champions League titles – but walked away from the opening leg of their Champions League semifinal at the Barcelona Olympic Stadium with just a draw against Inter, leaving them with it all to do on the road in Milan. Inter, who are bidding to make a second Champions League final in three seasons, will like their chances of getting past the flamboyant LaLiga leaders on home soil. But the Nerazzurri were far from their best on Saturday, forging a slender 1-0 home win against 15th-placed Verona in a domestic Serie A league fixture at the San Siro. Here is all to know before the semifinal decider between two of Europe’s football superclubs: Barcelona twice battled back to sharea compelling 3-3 drawat home against Inter Milan on April 30. The Italian side raced to a two-goal lead with superb strikes from Marcus Thuram and Denzel Dumfries before the unstoppable Lamine Yamal pulled Barca back into it with a sublime solo effort. Ferran Torres levelled for the five-time champions, and although Inter nosed ahead through Dumfries again, a Yann Sommer own goal left the tie on a knife-edge heading into the second leg. Playing his 100th game at just 17 years and 291 days old, Yamal became the youngest player to score in a UEFA Champions League semifinal against Inter on Wednesday, eclipsing the record set by Kylian Mbappe, who was 18 when he achieved the feat in 2017. Inter manager Simone Inzaghi said talents like the Barcelona teenager come around only once in a half-century. “He’s the kind of talent who is born every 50 years, I had never seen him live, and he really impressed me today,” the Inter coach said after Yamal helped Barcelona rally in the action-packed first leg. Barcelona coach Hansi Flick described his attacking winger as “a genius” after the match. Before the first leg, Yamal himself was forced to dismiss comparisons to the great Lionel Messi, who played the same position at Barcelona. “I don’t compare myself to him because I don’t compare myself to anyone – and much less with Messi,” Yamal told reporters. “So I don’t think the comparison makes sense – with Messi even less. I’m going to enjoy myself, and be myself.” Yamal said he thought the Argentinian forward was the greatest player of all time. “I admire him obviously as the best player in history, but I don’t compare myself to him,” he reiterated. Barcelona starting defender Jules Kounde is set to miss the Champions League semifinal second leg clash with Inter after he was diagnosed with a hamstring injury on Thursday. Unexpectedly, Flick may be able to call on star striker Robert Lewandowski, who is ahead of schedule on what was expected to be a three-week recovery period from a leg injury. Lewandowski was included in the squad on Monday after being sidelined for about two weeks. Goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny is tipped to start against Inter despite first-choice keeper Marc-Andre ter Steg’s return to the first XI in a LaLiga fixture at the weekend after a long injury layoff. Inter head into their second leg showdown at the San Siro with the availability of top scorer Lautaro Martinez highly questionable after the Argentina star suffered a leg injury against Barcelona last Wednesday.Inzaghi will have Mehdi Taremi or Marko Arnautovic on standby to replace Martinez in the starting lineup. But confidence is growing in the Inter camp that Martinez will play, according to Italian media reports on Monday. Lautaro himself posted a cryptic message on Instagram: a photo of him doing exercises in the gym, captioned with emojis of an hourglass and a battery. In a separate positive development for Inter, key defender Benjamin Pavard, who missed the first leg of the semifinal against Barca, is set to return to the starting XI, according to reporting from the Italian media outlet Gazzetta.it. Star midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu is available for selection after sitting out Inter’s 1-0 victory over Verona with a suspension. Barcelona possible XI:Szczesny; Eric, Araujo, Cubarsi, Inigo; de Jong, Pedri; Yamal, Olmo, Raphinha; Ferran Inter Milan possible XI:Sommer; Acerbi, Pavard, Bastoni; Dumfries, Barella, Calhanoglu, Mkhitaryan, Dimarco; Arnautovic, Thuram The teams have played on 13 prior occasions: Hansi Flick, Barcelona manager:“[In the second leg] Inter can’t just defend. They have to try and score too. It’s the semifinals of the UEFA Champions League and the four best teams in Europe are there. We play with style and confidence, and we know what we can do. We have 90 minutes next week, and hopefully that’s enough to get to the final. That’s our goal, and we will fight for it.” Simone Inzaghi, Inter Milan manager:“We saw a fantastic match [in the first leg] and we knew that semifinals are difficult. We could even have won. I really liked the impact that our subs had. Our fans know that we’ve been giving our utmost in difficult times and we know that Tuesday will be a ‘final’.” Barcelona most recently won in 2015 while Inter Milan last tasted victory in 2010. The winner of this semifinal heads to Germany on May 31 for the Champions League final. European football’s largest annual showpiece will be played at the 75,000-capacity Allianz Arena in Munich.",

    "article_text": "It starts streaming in June. It starts streaming in June. byAndrew Webster One of Netflix’s biggest shows is about to end — and you can get a brief glimpse at it in the first teaser trailer. The streamer just released a new clip ofSquid Game’s third season, and while it doesn’t show much, it manages to evoke the series’ distinct brand of tension, this time with a gumball machine as the centerpiece. Here’s the set-up, according to Netflix: Picking up from season 2’s devastating cliffhanger, season 3 thrusts Gi-hun (Player 456) back into the brutal heart of the games, determined to dismantle them once and for all. Still haunted by the betrayal and loss of his closest ally, Jung-bae (Player 390), Gi-hun faces new perils — including the Front Man, who shockingly infiltrated their rebellion disguised as Player 001. While season 1 ofSquid Gamedebuted in 2021, its sequel didn’t start streaming until several years later. There isn’t quite such a big gap for seasons 2 and 3 though;the second season streamed last December, and the third will premiere on June 27th. While the show itself is ending, Netflix seems intent on keeping the largerSquid Gameuniverse alive in various forms. The mobile titleSquid Game: Unleashedlaunched last year, and there arereports of a David Fincher-helmed spinoff as well. Of course,Squid Gameisn’t the streamer’s only hit series coming to an end: thefifth and final season ofStranger Thingsis also due out in 2025.

    "title": "The best robot vacuums",
    "article_text": "We picked the best bots you can buy right now. We picked the best bots you can buy right now. byJennifer Pattison Tuohy If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Robot vacuums are impressive devices that will clean your floors well and — thanks to bigger batteries and better robot brains — rarely get tired of doing their job. Over the last few years, they have gone from being utilitarian devices that sweep your floor tofull-fledged home robotsthat can vacuum and mop your home and then trundle off to clean themselves to be ready for the next run. I’ve been testing robot vacuums for seven years and have run over 70 robot vacuums all over my house. These are my top picks if you’re looking for the best: a robot vacuum that can do it all with limited intervention from you. Along with my top picks, I have options to fit specific needs, such as mopping or besting pet hair. The good news is there are a lot of great options. Whether you have a 3,000-square-foot home and three shaggy dogs or a small, stylish apartment you share with a goldfish, there’s a robot vacuum to suit your needs. It’s not all about suction. In my testing, the brush is also a big factor in how well a robot will clean your floors. A large rubber roller brush is much better than a small bristle brush at picking up debris. It’s also less prone to getting tangled up with hair. Two brushes are better than one, and a brush housing that has some flexibility — so it can move with the contours of the floor — is also more effective. It’s hard to find a robot vac that doesn’t have some form of mopping, but not all mops are created equal. I looked for mopping bots that could get up dried-on stains, like milk and ketchup, and scrub up small wet spills without messing themselves up. Oscillating, spinning, or vibrating mop pads clean better than bots that just drag a wet rag around, but the new self-cleaning roller mops that are beginning to appear are even more effective. Auto-carpet sensing is also important since it prevents the robot from accidentally mopping your rug. A big bin means you don’t need to empty it as often. The largest I’ve seen is 800ml, but anything over 500ml is decent. With many bots now pulling double duty as mopping robots, plus the popularity of self-empty dock / charging bases, it’s getting harder to find small robot vacs with big bins. But they’re worth considering — especially if you have carpets and pets. I love self-empty docks, but sometimes you don’t have space for them, and if you like your robot to be out of sight (living under your bed or sofa), you’ll want a big bin and no dock. These are becoming standard now and coming down in price (thankfully). A self-empty dock turns the charging base for your robot into a motorized emptying station that sucks out the dirt from its bin. (Warning: this process can be loud!) This saves you from having to pull out the bin after every few runs and empty it yourself. Instead, you’ll have to replace the bag (and buy new ones) when it gets full, generally about once a month. Many robots now have a self-empty dock option you can add later, although buying them together is generally cheaper. Another nice-to-have feature, AI-powered obstacle detection helps your robot “intelligently” detect and avoid clutter (and apotential poop apocalypse if it encounters pet waste). These models use cameras (worth noting) to see objects in their path and onboard processors to “decide” how to approach them based on what they see. All AI is not created equal, however, and some are much better at this than others. The end result is that robot vacuums with AI detection are less likely to get stuck when cleaning, so you’re more likely to come home to a clean floor rather than a beached bot. A robot that maps your house will get into every nook and cranny better than one that bumps and rolls around. Mapping also lets you send the robot to clean specific rooms rather than the whole space and add virtual walls to prevent your bot from going where you don’t want it to. These are crucial if you have delicate objects or areas in your home that regularly trap robots. Most robots use variations onsimultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology, such aslidarorvSLAM. A good app has easy controls to stop and start your vacuum, scheduling options (including do-not disturb hours), plus good mapping features. Nice-to-have features are room-specific cleaning and settings (so you can tell your vacuum to clean the kitchen or have it mop and vacuum the kitchen but only vacuum the living room). My biggest frustration with apps is maps that are fiddly to update and / or crash and must be rebuilt constantly. Most vacuums now have voice control (see FAQs), but some offer more in-depth control, such as telling Alexa to have the robot clean twice under the dining room table. Nearly all robot vacuums can “recharge and resume” — take themselves back to their dock when they’re low and recharge before picking up where they left off. But a vacuum with at least 120 minutes of runtime (180 is ideal) will clean the whole house in one go. If it takes too long, noisy robots that are constantly running will get shut off by annoyed family members who aren’t about to clean the room for you. Robot vacuums are quite an investment, and it’s important to be able to buy replacement parts to keep them going for longer and have access to good support in case your robot has a serious issue. 9 Verge Score Excellent vacuuming performanceGood sonic moppingExtendable side brush gets into corners betterVery good app Dock is still quite uglyMopping tray is hard to cleanExpensive Dustbin capacity:270ml /Self-empty dock option:Yes /Auto-refill mop option:Yes/ Mop lift:Yes, 20mm/Mop washing: Hot water and heated air drying/ Mapping:Yes, lidar /AI-powered obstacle detection:Yes /Suction power:10,000Pa/ Remote check-in:Yes/ Keep-out zones:Yes, virtual /Brush style:Dual rubber /Works with:Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts,Apple Home via Matter Roborock’sS8 MaxV Ultra($1,799.99) is an exceptional vacuum cleaner and a very good mop. Its dual rubber roller brushes and 10,000Pa suction make it great on carpets; its sonic mopping is very good on hard floors, and its improved AI-powered obstacle detection means it will most likely get the job done without getting trapped or derailed. The S8 MaxV Ultra is the best in the category of “hands-free” robot vacs, bots that do virtually everything for you: empty their bins, refill their mop tanks, and clean and dry their mop pads. Roborock invented this category with theS7 MaxV Ultraand has been steadily improving it. That’s the big selling point here; this bot is basically hands-free. Fill the S8 MaxV Ultra’s clean water tank and empty its dirty water once a week and change out the dust bag every couple of months. The robot will take care of the rest. For $100 more, you can dispense with dealing with the water tanks entirely and buy theRefill & Drainage Systemmodel. This lets you plumb the charging base directly into your home’s water supply. I’ve not tested this on the Roborock, but my experience with theSwitchBot S10with the same feature leads me to recommend this option if you can swing it. The S8 MaxV Ultra comes with excellent AI-powered obstacle detection, bringing back the camera it last had on the S7 MaxV Ultra. It’s not quite as good as Roomba’s obstacle detection — it sometimes confused a pile of Cheerios for a charging cable and avoided them — but it’s much better than the Roborocks that rely on non-camera obstacle detection. It deftly navigates around most household clutter, allowing you to get the job done without having to tidy up. Roborock has caught up to Roomba on cleaning prowess, and the S8 MaxV Ultra’s dual rubber brushes and 10,000Pa of suction power tackled the pet hair on my fluffy carpet and demolished my oatmeal test. It also did a better job at mopping than Roomba’s mopping bots, though not quite as well as the Narwal Freo X Ultra or Dreame X40 Ultra, though it’s a better vacuum than either. Its sonic mopping system — which vibrates its mop pad 4,000 times a minute — ably simulated scrubbing and wiped out my OJ and ketchup tests, though I did have to set it to deep scrub. Plus, the addition of a side mop and flexi-arm brush that extends from the bot helped with cleaning edges and corners. Roborock’s mobile app is easy to use and comes with a laundry list of features and customizations that give you ample control over your cleaning. The S8 MaxV Ultra also has a built-in voice assistant, which makes getting the bot to clean the mess your kid made after dinner as easy as saying, “Rocky, clean here.” Roborock also sells theS8 Max Ultra(no V) for $1,599.99. It has the same cleaning hardware as the MaxV but no camera, so its obstacle detection will not be as good. However, you also don’t have to worry about a camera in your house. It has a lower 8,000Pa of suction and lacks a voice assistant, too, which makes it seem overpriced since it’s currently only a couple hundred dollars less than the MaxV. There are several great vacuum / mop hybrids in this guide. Of them, the S8 MaxV Ultra is the best at vacuuming and obstacle detection, and it’s a very good mop. It can also do both in one run, as it can lift its mop 20mm, which will clear all but the highest-pile rugs. If you have a lot of those, go for the Dreame X40, with its automatic mop removal. Its vacuuming and object detection are a notch below the Roborock’s, but its mopping is a notch above. The Narwal Freo X Ultra is an even better mop than the Dreame, but its obstacle detection isn’t great, and its vacuuming is merely pretty good. 8 Verge Score Cheap, even with the auto-empty dockA dual mop and dustbin means no swappingRoom-specific cleaningCarpet boost Short battery lifeSlow to rechargeDocking can be spottyBasic obstacle detection Dustbin capacity:300ml /Self-empty dock option:Yes /Auto-refill mop option:No/ Mop lift:No/Mop washing: No/ Mapping:Yes, lidar /AI-powered obstacle detection:No /Suction power:5,300Pa/Remote check-in:No/Keep-out zones:Yes, virtual /Brush style:Single rubber bristle hybrid /Works with:Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts For around $300, the Tapo RV30 Max Plus is a very capable robot vacuum and mop with some key features usually only found on vacuums that are more than twice its price. These include room-specific cleaning, multiple suction and water levels, smart lidar-based navigation, and an auto-empty dock. With brands like Roomba and Roborock, you’re often paying double for the privilege of not having to empty the bot’s bin. Thanks to lidar navigation, the RV30 did an excellent job of navigating my house, cleaning the perimeters of the rooms, and then using a mesh grid to clean inside the rooms. I did have to tidy up before it ran, though, as there’s no camera on board or AI-powered obstacle detection — so cables and socks will trip it up. Its 5,200Pa suction power is impressive on a bot at this price, and ably sucked up Cheerios and dry oatmeal on hard flooring. It left some of the finer dust and debris, as its single bristle / rubber brush isn’t super effective. It fared less well on carpet. However, in the app, I could set it to clean a room three times for each job, after which it had generally picked up all visible debris. Mopping was better than average for a mop with no pressure or oscillation. It has a wide mop pad, and the bot has a big 300ml tank (which also incorporates a 300ml dustbin), so it applies enough water to do a good surface clean. Another unique feature for a budget robot is the ability to set customized cleaning for each room, choosing from five suction levels and three water levels as well as the three rotations. 5,200Pa suction power is impressive on a bot at this price The Tapo app is very simple to use, with an easy-to-edit map that lets you add virtual walls and no-go zones, add furniture, and designate carpet areas. There’s no carpet sensing, so you need to tell it where carpets are if you don’t want it to mop them. You can even set the cleaning direction and build up to four maps — again, features usually only found on higher-end robots. It’s also super easy to start a clean, and I really like that you can just tap on the map to send the robot to that spot. The biggest downside of the Tapo is its tiny battery, which is just 2,600mAh. That is half the size of most vacs, and it couldn’t clean my entire 800-square-foot downstairs without needing to go back and recharge. It also takes a while to charge and occasionally had trouble repositioning itself on its dock. You can get the RV30 without the auto-empty dock for around $80 less if you prefer an even simpler robot vacuum setup. This way, it will fit under a couch or bed, but you’ll have to manually empty its bin. 8 Verge Score The best mopping robotAlso good at vacuumingVery quietBig water tanks mean less refilling Middling laser-based obstacle avoidanceWonky appHuge charging dock Dustbin capacity:1L /Self-empty dock option:No /Auto-refill mop option:Yes/ Mop lift:Yes, 12mm/Mop washing: Yes, hot air drying/ Mapping:Yes, lidar /AI-powered obstacle detection:Yes /Suction power:8,200Pa/ Remote check-in:No/ Keep-out zones:Yes, virtual /Brush style:Single, conical rubber bristle hybrid /Works with:Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts The Narwal Freo X Ultra is one of the best mopping robots I’ve tested — and it’s a good vacuum, too. Its spinning triangular mop pads rotate at 180RPM with 12n of downward pressure. Combined with its ability to swing slightly to get closer to baseboards, the Narwal does a very good job on hard floors. Its dual four-liter water tanks will keep you going longer than most other mopping bots as well, the majority of which feature smaller tanks. The Narwal has some innovative features, including dirt sense — which analyzes the dirt level in the water and prompts it to remop — and an ability to adapt the pressure of its mop based on the type of floor, applying more pressure to tile and less to hardwood. “Freo” refers to the bot’s ability to make cleaning “decisions,” including going back to clean dirty floors. Its charging dock is very big, though, giving off a real Wall-E vibe. But despite the size, there’s no spot for an auto-empty dustbin; instead, Narwal’s disposable onboard bin compresses the dust, and Narwal claims you won’t need to empty it for up to 60 days. It wasn’t close to full after two weeks of testing. A bonus here is that there’s no loud noise, as is the case with most auto-empty docks. Its charging dock is very big, giving off a real Wall-E vibe In fact, the Freo X Ultra is one of the quietest bots I’ve tested. Even at full power, it was so quiet that I had to check that it was working. Its anti-tangle brush and 8,200Pa suction did a good job on most carpet, but its 12mm mop lifting isn’t good for plush carpets. Narwal’s obstacle detection is also only okay; there’s no camera, and it routinely eats cables. Its three lasers can identify objects as small as a sock and move around them, and it did pass my fake pet poop test. The app is very hard to follow, making it tricky to access all of the bot’s features. Mapping was fast, but it didn’t recognize all my rooms on the first go. It did better the second time, although splitting up rooms and naming them in the app was painful. The lack of a camera also means its navigation is spotty, and sending it to clean specific rooms wasn’t always successful. But if you’ve got a lot of hard floors to keep clean, it will do an excellent job. 8 Verge Score Self-removing mop padsMop extension reaches under edgesSelf-cleaning washboardDirt detection tech Middling AI obstacle detectionSingle rubber roller brushApp can be flaky Dustbin capacity:300ml /Self-empty dock option:Yes /Auto-refill mop option:Yes/ Mop-lift:Yes, 20mm/Mop washing: Hot water, hot air drying/ Mapping:Yes, lidar /AI-powered obstacle detection:Yes /Suction power:12,000Pa/ Remote check-in:Yes/ Keep-out zones:Yes, virtual /Brush style:Single, rubber /Works with:Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts The Dreame X40 is the best robot vacuum / mop hybrid because it can drop its mop pads automatically, extend them, and swing them to get under your cabinets and consoles. I watched the X40 spread its mops wide apart and swing behind my TV console, allowing it to access the dust wedged a good inch under it. That’s impressive. The X40 also features an extending side brush arm to reach corners — like the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra — and its dual oscillating mop pads are more effective than Roborock’s thin microfiber pad. If you have a mix of carpeted rooms and hardwood floors with high-pile rugs, the Dreame is the best robot vacuum for you. Its signature feature is its ability to automatically remove and reattach its mop pads, depending on whether it’s vacuuming or mopping. This solves the problem of how to vacuum and mop without getting your rugs wet. The robot will do this procedure multiple times during cleaning to ensure carpets are vacuumed and floors are mopped. Genius. While it’s a superb mopper, its vacuuming prowess is slightly behind the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra because, despite its 12,000Pa suction power, it still only has a single roller rubber brush. The Roborock’s dual rollers are simply better at getting dirt out of carpets and tackling pet hair. If you have a mix of carpeted rooms and hardwood floors with high-pile rugs, the Dreame is the best robot vacuum for you Roborock’s app is also more stable and easier to use than Dreame’s, which often crashes and can take a while to load. While the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra is my top pick overall, the Dreame X40 is a very good vacuum, and the two companies are neck and neck regarding innovative features. The X40 can also clean its washboard, something the Roborock can’t. That area can get quite grungy, so it needs a cleaning every few weeks. The X40 has AI-powered smart dirt detection that uses its cameras to identify spills like milk or particularly dirty areas. When it spots something, it will slow down and do a more thorough cleaning. I also like Dreame’s option to vacuum first and then mop, which the Roborock doesn’t offer. The X40 has AI-powered obstacle detection, although Roborock’s is just a bit better. However, both still get tripped up occasionally by pencils and other small items — something that never happens with the Roombas with this feature. 7 Verge Score Good AI-powered obstacle detectionEffective moppingExcellent valueNice dock Single rubber / bristle brushLower suction powerNo heated mop washingSome navigation issues Dustbin capacity:Unknown /Self-empty dock option:Yes /Auto-refill mop option:Yes /Mop lift:Yes, 12mm/Mop washing: Yes, hot air drying/ Mapping:Yes, lidar /AI-powered obstacle detection:Yes /Suction power:8,000Pa /Remote check-in: No /Keep-out zones:Yes, virtual /Brush style:Single rubber / bristle hybrid /Works with:Amazon Alexa, Google Home The Eufy X10 Pro Omni combines the Eufy Clean X9 Pro mopping robot vacuum and theEufy X8 Proself-empty robot vacuum. It’s the first Eufy with a multifunction auto-empty / wash / fill dock, and unlike many bots in this price range, it comes with AI-powered obstacle detection. With 8,000Pa suction and oscillating dual spinning brushes for mopping, the X10 has all the same functions as the top-of-the-line, all-in-one bots — but it’s not quite as good at any of them. Which is sort of the definition of “midrange.” The X10 has all the same functions as the top-of-the-line, all-in-one bots — but it’s not quite as good at any of them The Eufy performed excellently in my mopping tests, even eradicating dried stains with its 1kg of downward pressure. Thanks to an onboard water reservoir, it didn’t have to head home to fill up as frequently as some mopping bots do. It also has heated mop drying to help prevent the base from getting stinky — a first in this price range. (There’s no hot water washing.) An edge-hugging mode makes the robot swing its behind into the baseboards to help mop edges. With its square-ish shape, it got into corners better than most of the round bots. But its 12mm mop pad lift over carpet wasn’t effective, resulting in its pads getting hung up in a few places. The X10 has great object recognition, allowing it to suck up Cheerios and piles of oatmeal while deftly navigating fake dog turds and cables. However, its navigation sometimes got screwy; it would go into a corner and stay there for a while, trying to figure itself out. While its vacuuming is good, particularly on carpet and tile surfaces, the single rubber / bristle roller brush lets it down and is a good illustration of my point that it’s not all about suction power; it’s also about the brushes and how you use them. The Eufy’s brush is supposedly anti-tangle — a cutting tool inside the robot should shred the hair — but this wasn’t effective. The Eufy Clean app is very easy to use, and the lidar-powered mapping was fast and accurate, dividing my rooms correctly on the first try. There are many customization options — including room-specific cleaning, zone cleaning, and customized cleaning — but the app is clear and well laid out. 7 Verge Score Excellent vacuumingSuperior AI obstacle detectionSmart scrub feature works wellAttractive dock that doubles as a table Small mop padLimited cleaning customizationMapping can take a long timeNavigation can be buggy Dustbin capacity:250 ml /Self-empty dock option:Yes /Auto-refill mop option:Yes/ Mop lift:Yes, up and over/Mop washing: Yes/ Mapping:Yes, vSLAM /AI-powered obstacle detection:Yes /Suction power:N/A/ Remote check-in:No/ Keep-out zones:Yes, virtual /Brush style:Dual rubber /Works with:Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts, Apple Home via the Matter protocol. While Roombas may have fallen behind the competition in terms of features and innovation, there’s one area in which they reign supreme, and that’s cleaning prowess. Their dual rubber roller brushes rotate in opposite directions to effectively dig up dirt from carpets, and they are by far the best at tackling pet hair on all surfaces. They are also one of the most self-repairable robot vacuums you can buy, with spare parts for most of the bot’s bits readily available. The newest model, theCombo 10 Max, is the best Roomba for pet hair as it ties for the highest suction power of the current Roomba line, plus it can clean its own mop. It also has top-notch AI-powered obstacle detection that is able to tell the difference between pet poop and a pile of popcorn (and vacuum up one while avoiding the other). While its mopping isn’t great — the pad is tiny, and there’s no swinging to get along baseboards — it does a decent job, and itsretractable mopping systemis handy if you have a lot of carpets. All of this makes the Combo 10 Max a great buy for pet parents who are in a daily battle with shedding and occasional muddy paw prints. The Combo is the first Roomba with a multifunction dock that can refill its mopping tank and self-wash its mopping pad, meaning less hands-on time for you. (Thej9 Combo Plushas the same suction power and can refill its mopping tank but can’t wash the mop pad.) The SmartScrub feature that tells the robot to wiggle its butt to scrub your floors works surprisingly well, but it’s really only effective on small areas, making it good to run in hallways and around pet bowls for an extra clean. The Dirt Detect feature remembers the dirtiest rooms, actively seeking out spots my hairy Wirehaired Pointing Griffon hangs out The Dirt Detect feature remembers the dirtiest rooms, and I found that meant it actively seeks out the spots my hairy Wirehaired Pointing Griffon hangs out. The 10 Max can also be set to mop only, which is a new option and is handy for deep cleans. But there’s no hot water washing or hot air drying of the mop as there is on similar Dreame and Roborock models, so you’ll want to throw the pad in the washing machine every now and then. iRobot’s app is also a bit of a pain point. While I appreciate its simplicity, I miss the deeper cleaning customization options that most other high-end robot vacuum apps offer. And it’s recently started popping up ads for Roomba products when I navigate between screens — which is one of the features I did not want to see migrate over from the competition. While its mapping is very good, it can take a really long time (Roombas usevSLAM, not lidar), and it doesn’t seem to adapt to changes in my home as easily as other robots. (It also doesn’t lose my maps as often as other robots.) I’ve also noticed that the newer Roombas (j9 and 10 Max) suffer from the occasional navigation glitches, occasionally getting confused and needing to be rebooted. I really like Roomba’s dock design, which, while large enough to accommodate two rather small water tanks, is the most stylish of all the multifunction docks. Plus, because you access the water tanks from the front rather than the top (as on most other models), it can be used as a table. That’s a small quality-of-life upgrade I enjoy. Overall, it’s a good-looking robot that vacuums really well and is smart enough to get the job done with limited intervention. If you’re not interested in mopping at all, however, save some money and get theRoomba j9 Plus. It has similar cleaning prowess, a self-empty dock, and no messing with mopping. I test robot vacuums constantly. At any time, there are seven or eight of these busy little bots roaming my floors. Alongside everyday use, I put them through a gauntlet of specific tests. This includes testing object detection and avoidance with phone chargers, socks, a pencil, and fake pet poop. I throw in Cheerios or popcorn to see if they know to vacuum that up rather than avoid it. I also run them over oatmeal and flour to see how well they pick up fine debris and have them tackle both thick and low-pile carpets. I watch to see how they handle rug tassels, skinny chair legs, and room transitions. For mopping prowess, I test them on hardwood and tile floors with dried milk, fresh OJ, and ketchup. I monitor how quickly they fill up their bin / auto-empty dock and how efficiently they use water and clean their mop pads. I also set schedules, hook them up to voice assistants, and play with any advanced features in the app. I evaluate how well they map and how easy the maps are to edit and use, as well as test and unique features such as home security camera capabilities, AI cleaning programs, and auto-mop removal. Suction power ismeasured in pascals (Pa), and while most vacuums offer between 5,000 and 8,000, we’re starting to see robots with 18,000 and even 22,000Pa. Higher suction power will do a better job getting the fine dust and debris off your floor, but it’s important that it’s paired with effective brushes. The real key to a clean floor with a robot vac is consistency. Run it daily if you can; it won’t keep up as well if it only runs once a week. If you want hands-free cleaning everywhere, you’ll want to budget for one per floor or be prepared to move it around. You can also buy extra charging bases, and most models can map multiple floors. Yes, every Wi-Fi-connected robot vacuum worth its salt today works with Alexa or Google smart speakers for voice control. However, some are limited to stop, start, pause, and maybe suction level, whereas others can be told to go clean specific areas. Here’s how to set up a bot withAlexa voice controlorGoogle Home voice control. A couple of manufacturers now also work withSiri Shortcuts, so you can use Apple’s Siri voice assistant to command your bot. Robot vacuums arenow part of Matter, meaning more opportunities for smart home integration and native Siri voice control for robot vacuums. Matteris a new smart home standard that allows connected gadgets to work with any smart home platform, including Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Samsung SmartThings. When connected to your smart home platform through Matter, you should be able to control basic robot actions including start / stop and changing cleaning modes, as well as get alerts directly in the app, meaning you won’t need to use the manufacturer’s app for these functions.The latest Matter spec,Matter 1.4, adds support for cleaning specific areas, so while you will still need the manufacturer app to set up a map, you will be able to use your smart home platform app and / or voice assistant to direct the robot to do things like clean the kitchen or clean downstairs. Samsung SmartThings and Amazon both support robot vacuums in Matter; Apple has added itto iOS 18.4, which should come this spring, and Google said support is coming soon.While Amazon Alexa and Google Home have supported robot vacuums for years via the cloud, Matter will bring this control locally. It will also bring support to Apple Home for the first time, allowing you to control them with Siri through HomePods and add them to scenes and automation.There are still relatively few robot vacuums that support Matter.

A now-deleted blog post says Material 3 Expressive aims to make Android’s interface more appealing and easier to use. byEmma Roth Google just accidentally revealed its next big Android redesign: Material 3 Expressive. In a now-deleted blog postspotted by9to5Google, the company describes the change as the “most researched” update yet, with the goal of making its interface more appealing and easier to use. You can findan archived version of the deleted webpageon the Wayback Machine, and9to5Googlehas published some of the images not saved by the site. As outlined in the post, Google says it developed Material 3 Expressive after conducting 46 rounds of design and research with over 18,000 participants. The design uses color, shape, size, and motion to make a product “more usable.” It will alsohave its own session at Google I/Olater this month, As part of its research, Google studied things like where participants focused their attention in a design, how they reacted to different looks, and how quickly they understood an interface. The company also evaluated individual elements, like “which progress indicator made the waiting time feel faster” and “how big a button can be for positive improvements in tap time without overwhelming other items.” Google says its Material 3 Expressive design allowed people to find key elements in the interface up to four times faster when compared to the existing Material 3 design. It also says Material 3 Expressive “seems to level the playing field for users of all ages,” as the design helped people over 45 years old spot interface elements just as fast as younger users. Over the past several days, we’ve seen reports suggesting that Google is planning to roll outchanges across Android’s user interface, including redesigned status bar icons (like theone for the battery), a new clock font, and a reworked quick settings menu. Other leakshave shown changes to the Google Clock appas well. At this time of writing, Google still hasn’t republished the blog post, and it’s not clear when the company intended to officially announce Material 3 Expressive.The Vergereached out to Google with a request for more information but didn’t immediately hear back.

As part of the deal, Rivian will invest nearly $120 million towards the project, which is expected to directly create about 100 new jobs. In a press release, Pritzker says Rivian’s investment in the new facility will create “an entire ecosystem” that will help attract global investment and create jobs, as well as “strengthening the EV manufacturing supply chain.” Rivian saysthe supplier park is already under construction and is scheduled to be completed in 2026. It will feature an underground tunnel that connects it with the main plant so parts can easily be transferred without increasing traffic in the area. Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe says the park will be a “key enabler” in the production of its upcoming R2 vehicle. Scaringe todayshared an imageof the new Maximus drive unit on Instagram that will be used in the two-row electric SUV, which is slated for next year. Scaringe also says the supplier park will help increase production capacity for its current R1T and R1S vehicles, as well as its commercial vans, which are now available for sale toall commercial businesses.

    "article_text": "Apple’s latest MacBook Pro models are already falling in price, as is the new M4 Mac Mini. Apple’s latest MacBook Pro models are already falling in price, as is the new M4 Mac Mini. bySheena Vasani,Quentyn Kennemer, andAntonio G. Di Benedetto If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Apple currently sells MacBooks equipped with its own M-series chips in a wide range of sizes and price points.It discontinued the M1 MacBook Airto make room for newer models, but some retailers are still selling the last-gen laptop starting at $649 — a far cry from the $2,499 starting price of thelatest 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro. Purchasing a new MacBook can certainly be a pricey endeavor, but thankfully, finding a deal is actually not that difficult. Apple has recently shaken up the starting RAM for several models, creating more options than ever before and resulting in steeper discounts on older models. Although Macs may not experience perpetual discounts, it’s not uncommon to see various models discounted by as much as $400. Alternatively, purchasing refurbished options directly from Apple is another way to save money without waiting for the changing deal winds to blow your way. It’s also the only option to find certain SKUs of older models as Apple continues to move forward on newer releases.Apple’s refurbished storeprovides a one-year warranty on all products, and generally offers discounts of up to 15 to 20 percent off the price of a new unit. But if you want to buy new and you’re looking to save whatever you can, here are the best MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini deals available. TheM1 MacBook Airwas considered Apple’s entry-level laptop before the M3 model’s arrival prompted Apple to stop selling it directly in its online and in brick-and-mortar stores. But while theredesigned M2 version of the MacBook Air(which has been with us for a while as well) has taken over as the top value choice, the 2020 version with an M1 processor and fanless design remains available at some retailers as a solid budget option. It’s best suited for non-intensive productivity work, plus it has a comfortable keyboard, an excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. For many people, the M1 Air still ticks the right boxes when it comes to performance and price, even if it’s long enough in the tooth to have been removed in ourguide to the best laptops. The base MacBook Air with the M1 chip comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It’s becoming harder to find in new condition, but Walmart hascommitted to keeping it aroundfor the foreseeable future and is currentlydiscounting it to $649($350 off), which is $20 shy of its lowest price to date. The 2020 MacBook Air has been discontinued but remains a great value. It comes outfitted with the company’s original M1 chip in one of three different colors (silver, space gray, and gold). The M2 MacBook Air is a slim, lightweight laptop with a 1080p webcam and a handy magnetic charger that frees up one of its two USB-C ports. Although its M2 processor wasn’t as revolutionary as the M1 generation, it’s a better performer for any kind of user than the M1, including creators with demanding workloads. It does have some slight downsides, though, includingslower storage in the base 256GB configurationand a notch cutout in its otherwise excellent screen. But even so, Apple hasn’t offered a more travel-friendly laptop than this one since the days of the polarizing 12-inch MacBook, and this prior-gen model was once good enough to top our list of thebest laptops. TheM2-powered MacBook Airfrom 2022 seems to be on its way out, with availability waning. However, you can get the 13.6-inch M2 model with 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and an eight-core GPU in select colors atBest Buystarting at $799 ($200 off), which is $50 shy of its all-time low price. If you don’t mind sacrificing some memory for extra storage, you can also get the 13-inch Air with 8GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD atBest Buyfor $799 ($200 off). It’s a bit harder to find discounts on the 15.3-inch MacBook Air M2, however. While it’s scantily in stock at some retailers for its original MSRP, you’d be better off going with a discounted M3 model. The 2022 MacBook Air is a thin, lightweight device powered by Apple’s M2 chip. The M2 model touts an improved 1080p webcam and a better display than its predecessor while retaining features like long battery life and MagSafe charging. The M1 Air and its wedge had to perish for theM3 MacBook Airto exist. Apple’s updated entry-level laptops arrived in both 13.6- and 15.3-inch variants simultaneously, bringing with them slightly faster performance and a slate of minor upgrades. Apple added Wi-Fi 6E, for one, along with an additional Thunderbolt port that allows you to use two external displays when the lid is closed. They also continue to offer 18 hours of battery life and a MagSafe charging port, though the M3 Air starts at a slightly higher price than its predecessor at $1,099. That said, Apple recently discontinued the M3 MacBook Air with 8GB of RAM andnow considers the 16GB / 256GB model as the starting configuration. Right now, the 13-inch M3 MacBook Air is available in its entry-level configuration with an 8-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD on sale atB&H Photoin select colors starting at $829 ($270 off). You can also find the 16GB RAM / 512GB SSD model with a 10-core GPU for $1,099 ($200 off) in select colors atAmazon. Given the $270 price difference between these two models, it’s great that you’re getting double the amount of internal storage. As for the M3-powered 15-inch MacBook Air,B&H Photois selling the laptop for an all-time low of $999 ($300 off) with a 10-core GPU, 256GB of storage, and 16GB of RAM. You can also buy it with 512GB of storage, 16GB of RAM, and a 10-core GPU for $1,249($250 off) atBest Buy. The MacBook Air M3 is a jack-of-all-trades, with a balanced combination of performance and power efficiency. It also now supports dual displays with the lid closed, and the storage speed is noticeably faster. You don’t need to think about if this laptop will meet your needs — it just will. Along with anupdated Mac Studio, Apple recently announced a newMacBook Air, which comes in both a 13- and 15-inch configuration with a M4 processor. Interestingly, the new Air starts at a lower price than the prior model, yet it offers slightly faster performance and twice as much base RAM at 16GB. It can also connect to two external monitors with the lid open, comes in a new sky blue color, and features the 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam from the latest MacBook Pro. There’s a lot to like. Both the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Airs are currently receiving their first discounts. You can pick up the 13-inch base model with a 10-core CPU, eight-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage on sale for $849 ($150 off) atAmazon,Best Buy, and atB&H Photo. If you prefer the larger 15-inch model, the entry-level configuration with a 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage is on sale for $1,049 ($150 off) atAmazon,Best Buy, andB&H Photo. Powered by the new M4 chip, Apple’s 13-inch MacBook Air is faster than its predecessor and offers double the base RAM. It can also now connect to two external displays with the lid open and features an improved Center Stage webcam. Apple’s 15-inch MacBook Air with the M4 chip is nearly identical to its 13-inch sibling. However, it includes a six-speaker sound system, not four, and your choice of a free 35W Dual USB‑C Port Compact Power Adapter or 70W USB‑C Power Adapter. During its“Scary Fast” eventin 2023, Apple announced new MacBook Pros that use M3 processors — including a new 14-inch model that replaced the 13-inch M2 model. Apple followed the M3 models up withM4-based machines in October 2024, and we’re already starting to see the discounts on them. That being said, the last-gen M3 models are often the better bargain, as they’re still relatively easy to find and receive steeper discounts. The entry point into the MacBook Pro world is a MagSafe-equipped MacBook Pro that uses the existing 14-inch design and slightly pares it down. The14-inch M3 MacBook Prohas the same 3024 x 1964 resolution display and 120Hz refresh rate as its pricier siblings, and in addition to a MagSafe charging port, it has an SD card slot and HDMI port. However, it starts with just 8GB of RAM and lacks the third USB-C / Thunderbolt port found on the M3 Pro and M3 Max models (as well as Thunderbolt 4 speeds). The M3 MacBook Pro may be a bit of an odd middle child in some ways, but it’s still a very good laptop — especially if you can find a deal that puts more price distance between the M3 model and the M3 Pro version. Availability for the base model with 8GB and 512GB of storage seems to be waning as Apple standardizes 16GB of RAM across its lineup. We’re finding it challenging to spot the 16GB RAM / 512GB SSD model in stock. However,Best BuyandB&H Photoare selling the 14-inch, M3-powered MacBook Pro with 18GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, 14-core GPU for $1,499 ($500 off). Apple’s previous-gen 14-inch laptop powered by the M3 processor uses a similar design to the pricier 14-inch MacBook Pro with Apple’s Pro- / Max-series chips but is offered at a lower price with similar ports and less RAM. The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros of late 2023 are another round of spec-bump models, much like their previous 2022 incarnations. Now starting with the M3 Pro chip (or the speedier M3 Max) and 18GB of base RAM instead of 16GB, the new models remain targeted at creatives doing content work like video editing, photo processing, and other graphical work. Like their predecessors and the M1 Pro generation before that, they offer MagSafe charging, three USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports, HDMI-out, and a full-size SD card slot, with prices starting at $1,999 for the 14-inch and $2,499 for the 16-inch. You can, of course, spec them up the wazoo if you’re willing to pay more, as exhibited bythe review unit Apple sent us of the 16-inch model, which cost an eye-watering $7,199. But rest assured, versions that normal people are more likely to buy receive regular discounts. For instance, the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 Pro (11-core CPU / 14-core GPU), 18GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD is going for $1,699 ($300 off) atB&H Photo, which is a nice deal but nowhere near the lowest price we’ve seen previously. As for the base 16-inch Pro — which comes with an M3 Pro chip, 18GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD — it’s on sale starting atBest Buyfor $1,999 ($400 off), which is its best price to date.Best Buyis also selling the 16-inch M3 Pro model with 36GB of RAM and 512GB of storage for $2,399 ($400 off). The 14-inch MacBook Pro from 2023 comes in a space black color and is configurable with either an M3 Pro or M3 Max chip. It looks a lot like the previous M2 generation, but spec-wise, the M3 Pro models start with a 12-core CPU, 18GB of RAM, and 512GB SSD. The 16-inch MacBook Pro remains Apple’s largest laptop for creators and power users. The 2023 model includes a spec bump to the M3 Pro and M3 Max chips, with a claimed battery life of up to 22 hours, and is configurable with up to 128GB of RAM. Apple released the M4-series MacBook Pro in November 2024. Notably, the base14-inch M4 MacBook Prois the first to launch with 16GB of RAM — double the previous generation’s starting memory — and 512GB of storage for the same $1,599 starting price as the last-gen model. It also picks up a third Thunderbolt 4 port, which is positioned on the right side and supports dual external monitors while the lid is opened. Also new this year is an upgraded 12-megapixel webcam that supports Center Stage and a new Desk View feature, plus the option to add a nano-texture display for an extra $150. It’s also available in space black. The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips also received additional RAM, bringing them up to 24GB. They start with 512GB of storage, too, and retail for $1,999 and $2,499, respectively. While the total port selection hasn’t changed compared to their respective M3 Pro and M3 Max counterparts, you’ll get faster Thunderbolt 5 ports on these more substantial models. That’s in addition to the SD slot, dedicated full-sized HDMI port, and 3.5mm jack. They also have the upgraded 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam with Desk View and the optional nano-texture display option. Deals for the M4 MacBook Pro have already started to roll in. Right now, for example, the base 14-inch MacBook Pro M4 with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD starts at $1,399 ($200 off) atB&H Photo. Meanwhile, the 24GB / 512GB variant with an M4 Pro chip (12-core CPU / 16-core GPU) is down to $1,799 ($200 off) atAmazonandB&H Photo. The base 16-inch MacBook Pro is also on sale with an M4 Pro chip, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for $2,249 ($250 off) atAmazonandB&H Photo. The entry-level MacBook Pro with M4 starts with 16GB of RAM — double that of its predecessor — and a 512GB SSD for the same starting price of $1,599. It also gets a third USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 port and comes in a new space black option. The 14-inch MacBook Pro with a 12-core / 16-core M4 Pro chip starts with 24GB of RAM — a 6GB increase over the prior generation. It also has a 512GB SSD, three Thunderbolt 5 USB-C ports, an optional nano-texture display, and a 12-megapixel webcam. The 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro starts with 24GB of RAM and offers more computing cores (14 for the CPU and 20 for the GPU) compared to the 14-inch model. It also picks up Thunderbolt 5 ports and a new 12-megapixel Center Stage camera. There’s a new Mac Mini in town, asM4-based models arrived late last year. Apple reduced the horizontal footprint on its desktop and paired it with its new M4 chipset and 16GB of RAM, which is double that of the previous generation and brings it in line with other base model Macs from 2024. That makes Apple’s newest desktop computer a tremendous value. Deals on the newest Mac Mini are a bit easier to come by now than they were at launch, which is good since the outgoing M2 model is becoming more difficult to find. TheM4 Mac Ministarts with an M4 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage for $599. That’s an incredible value for a tiny desktop computer that can rival theMac StudioandMac Prowhen it comes to certain tasks, including light gaming, 4K video editing, and 3D modeling. Vertically, the M4 Mac Mini is a fair bit thicker than the last-gen M2 model at 2 inches tall, yet it measures a mere 5 inches wide and 5 inches deep. In addition to the odd decision to place thepower button on its underside, Apple moved the 3.5mm headphone jack and two of its five USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports to the front. The rear features an additional three thunderbolt ports, HDMI-out, and a gigabit ethernet port. You can also get the Mac Mini with an M4 Pro chipset starting at $1,399, which comes with faster Thunderbolt 5 storage and the option to upgrade to 10-gigabit ethernet for another $100. Right now, you can get the base Mac Mini atB&H Photowith an M4 chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD for $529 ($70 off). If you need more storage, you can step up to the version with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for around $743 ($56 off) atAmazonandB&H Photo. Meanwhile, the base M4 Pro model with 24GB of RAM and 512GB of storage is on sale atAmazonstarting at $1,230.54 ($169 off). The latest Mac Mini features Apple’s upgraded M4 chips and a smaller build than the prior model. Each configuration now starts with 16GB of RAM and includes five total Thunderbolt ports, gigabit ethernet, HDMI, and a 3.5mm jack.

    "article_text": "Are Insta360 and GoPro getting some competition? Are Insta360 and GoPro getting some competition? bySean Hollister DJI hasn’t even announced a 360-degree camera yet, but the DJI Osmo 360 has now spilled its guts all over the web.Leakers HakasushiandIgor Bogdanovhave published over a dozen pictures of a prototype dual-lens camera, including both external and internal photos and images of its Quick Start Guide. Together, they suggest that DJI may finally be about to competewith Insta360and theupcoming GoPro Max 2in letting you capture attention-grabbing spherical photos and video — check outmy colleague Vjeran Pavic’s recent videoto see what these cameras can do. And it appears that DJI may have chosen quite a small, squareish design, instead of the more elongated stick shapes of its Insta360 rival. As you can see above, it’s roughly 6.5 centimeters (2.6in) wide and maybe 9mm tall. While we don’t have much in the way of all-important specs like video resolution and framerate, we can see it has three buttons including power, recording, and menu controls, plus a tap-and-swipe touchscreen, and it uses interchangeable 7.55Wh batteries that look like those for DJI’s Osmo Action series. According to the quick start guide, the “OQ001” model has microSD storage, a USB-C charge port, Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.1, and it can physically mount “various accessories” — intriguingly, the unit’s tripod mount seems to have four copper contacts surrounding it, perhaps to let an accessory provide power or data. Internally, the teardown shows that DJI mounts its camera sensors the same way as Insta360. Instead of having a sensor directly facing each lens, the light first bounces off a 45-degree mirror. Hakasushi has published quite afew other teardown photos too, but says the internals might change, as this one appears to be a prototype. Unusually,DJI leaker Jasper Ellens speculates that DJI may not bring this camera to market, particularly not in the United States, as word (and leaks) would usually have reached him by now if it were. “I can’t find any early leaks on web stores, multiple sources never received it and therefore it’s even a better hidden secret than the DJI Mavic 4 or DJI Mini 5,” he writes. Then again,DJI is livinginunprecedented times.

    "article_text": "OpenAI says it moved forward with the update even though some expert testers indicated the model seemed ‘slightly off.’ OpenAI says it moved forward with the update even though some expert testers indicated the model seemed ‘slightly off.’ byEmma Roth Last week, OpenAIpulled a GPT-4o updatethat made ChatGPT “overly flattering or agreeable” — and now it has explained what exactly went wrong. Ina blog post publishedon Friday, OpenAI said its efforts to “better incorporate user feedback, memory, and fresher data” could have partly led to “tipping the scales on sycophancy.” In recent weeks, users have noticed that ChatGPT seemed toconstantly agree with them, even in potentially harmful situations. The effect of this can be seen ina report byRolling Stoneabout people who say their loved ones believe they have “awakened” ChatGPT bots that support their religious delusions of grandeur, even predating the now-removed update. OpenAI CEO Sam Altmanlater acknowledged thatits latest GPT-4o updates have made it “too sycophant-y and annoying.” In these updates, OpenAI had begun using data from the thumbs-up and thumbs-down buttons in ChatGPT as an “additional reward signal.” However, OpenAI said, this may have “weakened the influence of our primary reward signal, which had been holding sycophancy in check.” The company notes that user feedback “can sometimes favor more agreeable responses,” likely exacerbating the chatbot’s overly agreeable statements. The company said memory can amplify sycophancy as well. OpenAI says one of the “key issues” with the launch stems from its testing process. Though the model’s offline evaluations and A/B testing had positive results, some expert testers suggested that the update made the chatbot seem “slightly off.” Despite this, OpenAI moved forward with the update anyway. “Looking back, the qualitative assessments were hinting at something important, and we should’ve paid closer attention,” the company writes. “They were picking up on a blind spot in our other evals and metrics. Our offline evals weren’t broad or deep enough to catch sycophantic behavior… and our A/B tests didn’t have the right signals to show how the model was performing on that front with enough detail.” Going forward, OpenAI says it’s going to “formally consider behavioral issues” as having the potential to block launches, as well as create a new opt-in alpha phase that will allow users to give OpenAI direct feedback before a wider rollout. OpenAI also plans to ensure users are aware of the changes it’s making to ChatGPT, even if the update is a small one.

    "article_text": "A serger is a perfect tool for creating knits and other stretchy garments, according to our senior designer. A serger is a perfect tool for creating knits and other stretchy garments, according to our senior designer. byCath VirginiaandBarbara Krasnoff If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Cath Virginia is the senior designer here atThe Verge, who creates illustrations and collages for our articles. However, she also has “dabbled” (as she puts it) in feature designs for articles such as2004 was the first year of the future(which won the2025 ASME Awardfor Best News and Entertainment Design),How the Stream Deck rose from the ashes of a legendary keyboard, andThe Lurker. “I also designed the branding forNotepad by Tom Warrenand recently refreshed the look ofVerge Deals,” she explains.When not doing this impressive work, Cath sews. A lot. And so, when I asked her what one of her favorite gadgets was, she said it was her Brother 1034D Serger. If you’re not quite sure what a serger is (I certainly wasn’t), read on.What exactly is a thread serger?A serger, also known as an overlocker, is a type of sewing machine generally used in apparel making. It has two needles and uses up to four strands of thread at a time to create the loops and finished edge you see on the inside of most knitwear, like T-shirts and leggings. It also has a knife that cuts the edge of your fabric at the same time, so the finished product looks clean and professional.When did you buy this one, and what went into the decision?I bought this one this past March as a birthday and tax return present. I’ve been wanting one for a while, because I sew a lot of clothes. I’m picky about style and, being fat, have a hard time finding clothes I like that actually fit me. I also love wearing knits because they’re comfortable, and traditional sewing machines aren’t intended primarily to sew knit garments, which need to have stretchy seams. You can use a zigzag stitch to achieve a stretch in your seam, but the serger sews and cuts all at once, as well as finishes the inside edges, so it saves a lot of time.In choosing a serger, I wanted one that was easy to thread, had an adjustable free arm for sewing cuffs and sleeves, and could sew multiple layers of fabric at a time. I watched a bunch of YouTube reviews of sergers and found this one to be pretty affordable — and it checked my boxes. It also got better reviews than its cheaper sibling, the DX. I was intimidated by it at first because four spools of thread is kind of scary. But it has clearly labeled and color-coded instructions for threading and comes with a manual, so I learned it and had it down in under half an hour. What do you usually create with it?So far, I have hemmed a couple shirts and made a maxi skirt (with pockets!) and a crop top. That was after a long and frustrating period trying to learn how to use it. I also dulled two different knives, learning that you can’t sew over pins with a serger because there is a big metal knife chopping your seam off.What do you like about it?Sometimes when you’re sewing knits on a traditional (lockstitch) machine, the edges become unintentionally ruffle-y (due to its one measlyfeed dog, which is the moveable plate that pulls the material through from stitch to stitch). This can make your piece look pretty weird and bad. Another great thing about this serger is that it has something called differential feed, which uses two feed dogs to sew your fabric together. It can be adjusted to feed one piece of fabric faster or slower, so it will flatten out your wobbly knitted seams or can be used to create alettuce hem. It alsocomes with a gathering foot, which can be used to gather and sew (intentional) ruffles!Is there anything about it that you dislike or that you think could be improved?This is actually on me for not doing quite enough research, but when I bought it, I was excited to finally be able to do the coveted two-threadcoverstitchyou see on the hems of T-shirts and other knit stuff, only to find out youactually need a whole other machine that literally only does that one thing.That was disappointing to find out, but to compensate, the serger does actually come with ablind hem footthat you can use to do an okay impression of one. It’s kind of a finicky stitch to get right, though, because you’re sewing from the wrong side of the fabric, and I had to do quite a few samples to test it out before I used it on any garments.Who would you recommend it to?If you sew a lot of knitwear clothing, it can be a really useful tool for leveling up your garments and being a bit more efficient! It’s not a total replacement for a lockstitch sewing machine but I’m really liking it so far. Don’t be too intimidated by the four threads: they are your friends. And don’t try to sew over any of your pins. Designed for finishing the edges and hems of a wide range of fabrics, especially linens and stretchy fabrics, and for creating ruffles and decorative edges.

    "title": "Shingles vaccine lowers risk of heart disease for 8 years, study finds",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 5, 2025 / 7:05 PM EDT/ CBS News Getting a shingles vaccine may help with more than the viral infection that causes painful rashes — new research shows it can also lower the risk of heart disease. In the study, published Monday in theEuropean Heart Journal, researchers found people given the shot had a 23% lower risk of cardiovascular events, including stroke, heart failure and coronary heart disease, for up to 8 years. The study examined more than 1 million people aged 50 or older with data from 2012 onward. The protective effect was particularly prominent in men, people under 60 and those who smoke, drink or aren't active, the study found. Dong Keon Yon, a professor from the Kyung Hee University College of Medicine in Seoul, South Korea, who led the study, said in a news release that there are several reasons why the shingles vaccine may help reduce heart disease. \"A shingles infection can cause blood vessel damage, inflammation and clot formation that can lead to heart disease. By preventing shingles, vaccination may lower these risks,\" he explained. \"Our study found stronger benefits in younger people, probably due to a better immune response, and in men, possibly due to differences in vaccine effectiveness.\" The vaccine analyzed was a live zoster vaccine, which contains a weakened form of the varicella zoster virus that causes shingles. Not everyone can take the live vaccine, however, including those with certain immune system conditions, and some countries are replacing it with non-live, recombinant vaccines. The United States is among the countries that use thenew vaccine, Shingrix, which was introduced in 2017. The vaccine, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline, is more than 90% effective in preventing shingles. It replaced the previously used single-dose live vaccine, Zostavax, by Merck. \"Since the live zoster vaccine is not suitable for everyone, more research on the recombinant vaccine is needed\" to confirm if it has a similar impact, Yon said, adding that the study also does not establish a direct causal relationship. The Centers for Disease Control and Preventionalready recommendseveryone get the two-dose shingles vaccine starting at age 50. Shingles, which causes a painful rash, is caused by the same virus behindchickenpox. The virus lies dormant in people who've had chickenpox and years later can reactivate as shingles. The risk of shingles also increases with age, particularly in those older than 50, according to the CDC. This isn't the first time a shingles vaccine has been shown to have other possible health benefits.A study last yearfoundlatestshingles shot also seems to delay the onset of dementia, a memory-impairing condition. In that study, published inNature Medicinein July, researchers found people who got the vaccine lived, on average, an additional 164 days without a dementia diagnosis compared to those who received the previous shingles vaccines. \"The fact that we have a vaccine that's already approved, already out there, covered by insurance, super easy to get. The fact that that is showing this kind of level of protection is really promising for a lot,\" Dr. Céline Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said on\"CBS Mornings\"at the time.

    "title": "Trump administration urges judge to toss states' lawsuit over abortion pill",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 5, 2025 / 7:00 PM EDT/ CBS News Washington —The Trump administration on Monday urged a federal district court to dismiss a lawsuit challenging the Food and Drug Administration's actions expanding access to the widely used abortion pill mifepristone. Justice Department lawyers wrote in afilingwith the U.S. district court in Amarillo, Texas, that the three states pursuing the lawsuit — Missouri, Idaho and Kansas — should not be able to do so in that court. The administration is pursuing a request initially made by the Biden administration last year in the closely watched challenge to mifepristone, a drug used to terminate an early pregnancy, that has been playing out before U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk. \"At bottom, the states cannot keep alive a lawsuit in which the original plaintiffs were held to lack standing, those plaintiffs have now voluntarily dismissed their claims, and the states' own claims have no connection to this district,\" Trump administration lawyers wrote. \"The states are free to pursue their claims in a district where venue is proper, but the states' claims before this court must be dismissed or transferred pursuant to the venue statute's mandatory command.\" The legal battle over mifepristone was initially filed by a group of anti-abortion rights doctors and medical associations in November 2022. The coalition sought to roll back a series of changes made by the FDA that relaxed the rules for the drug's use. But the Supreme Court last year rejected that challenge andunanimously ruledthat the plaintiffs did not have the legal right to sue, a concept known as legal standing. But attorneys general for Missouri, Idaho and Kansas, who had intervened at an earlier stage in the litigation, sought to continue the lawsuit. Theyarguedthat changes made by the FDA beginning in 2016 were unlawful. Among those efforts were allowing mifepristone to be taken up to 10 weeks into a pregnancy, rather than seven weeks, expanding the health care providers who can prescribe the drug and allowing the medication to be dispensed through the mail. The Justice Department said in its filing to Kacsmaryk, who was appointed by President Trump during his first term, that the states' claims \"have no connection\" to the Northern District of Texas, where the case was filed, and that even if they were to file their own lawsuit there, it could not move forward because it is not the proper venue. \"Regardless of the merits of the states' claims, the states cannot proceed in this court,\" administration lawyers said. \"The states' amended complaint should be dismissed or transferred for lack of venue.\" The Justice Department also said the states do not have the legal standing to sue and waited too long to challenge the FDA's 2016 actions, which are subject to a six-year statute of limitations. The FDA first approved mifepristone in 2000 and has issued a series of changes in the years since that have made the drug more widely available. Medication abortions made up more than half of all abortions in the United States health care system in 2023, according to a study from the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights research group. Twenty-eight states restrict access to mifepristone, according to the organization, four of which prohibit the mailing of abortion pills to patients. The filing from the Trump administration is the first in which it has expressed a position on the challenge involving mifepristone. After Mr. Trump won a second term in office, conservativesurged his administrationto force the FDA to roll back its earlier moves that made mifepristone easier to obtain. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.told senatorsduring his confirmation hearing earlier this year that Mr. Trump had asked him to study the safety of mifepristone. Kennedy, whose agency oversees the FDA, said that while the president had not taken a stand on how to regulate the abortion pill, he would implement the president's policies. The president said in June 2024 that hehad \"strong views\"on mifepristone and pledged to release a policy position on access to the drug, but did not do so.

He also ordered at least 20% of general officers in the National Guard and 10% of all flag and general officers to be cut. In the one-page memo, which waspostedon the Defense Department's website, Hegseth said that to \"drive innovation and operational excellence, the military must be \"unencumbered by unnecessary bureaucratic layers that hinder their growth and effectiveness,\" and part of achieving this \"is removing redundant force structure to optimize and streamline leadership by reducing excess general and flag officer positions.\" Hegseth announced the memo in a video on X, vowing, \"We're going to shift resources from bloated headquarters elements to our warfighters.\" He did not give a timeline for the cuts but said they would be carried out \"expeditiously.\" There are currently 38 four-star generals or admirals, as of March 31, 2025, according to Defense Department data.

    "title": "U.S. offers migrants free airline tickets and $1,000 stipend if they self-deport",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 5, 2025 / 6:05 PM EDT/ CBS News The Trump administration announced Monday it will offer free airline tickets and a $1,000 incentive to some unauthorized immigrants if they sign up for self-deportation and return to their home countries voluntarily. The Department of Homeland Security said it has helped some migrants obtain plane tickets so they can return to their native countries in the next two weeks. A migrant has already returned to Honduras using the self-deportation program to book a flight out of Chicago, the department added. Those interested in participating in the self-deportation initiative are being instructed to use a government smartphone app now known asCBP Home— which the Biden administration previously used to allow certain migrants to enter the U.S. legally — to tell officials they plan to leave the country. Eligible immigrants will receive both travel assistance and the $1,000 stipend, which DHS officials said will be paid after the U.S. government confirms the individual has left the country. The Trump administration said those who sign up for self-deportation using the CBP Home app will be deprioritized for arrest and detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, \"as long as they demonstrate they are making meaningful strides in completing that departure.\" The incentives offered on Monday are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to push unauthorized immigrants — with both sticks and carrots — to leave the U.S. The Trump administration hasthreatenedcertain unauthorized immigrants with prosecution, jail time and fines if they fail to register with the federal government. It has also dramatically broadened whom ICE deportation officers can target for arrest, reversing Biden-era rules that largely limited immigration arrests to serious criminals, national security threats and recent arrivals. In its announcement Monday, the Trump administration portrayed self-deportation as a \"dignified way\" to leave the U.S., given that the alternative could be a forced deportation after being detained by ICE agents. But the self-deportation push also helps the government conserve resources and money. As currently staffed and resourced, ICE does not have the personnel, detention space and assets to find, arrest, detain and deport the millions of immigrants estimated to be in the country without authorization. DHS officials argued on Monday that the travel assistance and stipend would also save the U.S. government money, saying that arresting, detaining and deporting a migrant costs $17,121, on average. DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the Trump administration has tracked \"thousands\" of self-deportations so far. The Trump administration has repeatedly said those who participate in the self-deportation campaign may be able to come back to the U.S. legally in the future. But seeking permission to enter the U.S. legally is often a lengthy, complicated and expensive process, and poor and destitute individuals without any family or employers in the U.S. generally don't qualify for a visa. Additionally, those who leave the U.S. after being in the country illegally for over a year could face a 10-year ban on reentry. Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

    "title": "States sue over Trump administration's mass HHS layoffs",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 5, 2025 / 5:37 PM EDT/ CBS News Over a dozen states sued the Trump administration Monday for laying off thousands of Health and Human Services staffers, urging a court to reverse job cuts that they argue brought work at large swaths of theRobert F. Kennedy Jr.-led health agency to a \"sudden halt.\" The lawsuit —filed in Rhode Island federal courtby New York, California, 17 other states and Washington, D.C. — claims the Trump administration has sought to \"dismantle\" HHS through layoffs that disproportionately hit \"disfavored work and programs,\" like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration. HHS is aiming tocut its headcount by 20,000— or nearly 25% — through a combination of layoffs, buyouts and early retirement offers, the departmentannouncedin March, framing it as a \"dramatic restructuring\" aimed at making HHS more efficient and cutting redundant or unnecessary services. The cuts are part of a wider initiative by the Trump administration, led by billionaireElon Musk, to slash the size of the federal government. Since then, thousands of HHS staff havegotten layoff notices. The cuts have hit large agencies like the FDA and CDC, along withdepartmentsthat handlemental health,federal poverty guidelinesand other services, CBS News has previously reported. Deep cutsare also slatedfor theNational Institutes of Health. Monday's lawsuit, which names Kennedy and other HHS leaders as defendants, argues these job cuts have \"systematically deprived HHS of the resources necessary to do its job.\" The layoffs have allegedly cut off the states from data and made it harder to access grants for everything fromworker safetyto the Head Start preschool program, the lawsuit argues. The suit also says the agency has shuttered keydiseasetesting labs, forcing them to \"find new partners to handle their most difficult testing needs that had previously been handled by the CDC.\" The states are asking a federal judge to halt Kennedy's directive to reorganize and cut the HHS, arguing the moves exceed HHS's legal authority and violate the Constitution's separation of powers doctrine by slashing programs authorized by Congress. The suit also takes aim at Kennedy's views, citing his vaccine skepticism and \"history of advocating for the evisceration of the Department's statutorily mandated work promoting public health.\" It also pointed to Kennedy'sacknowledgementthat 20% of job cuts at the HHS may need to be reversed due to \"mistakes.\" An HHS spokesperson said in response to the lawsuit, \"HHS remains confident that the process will withstand legal scrutiny.\" \"We are following the law, period. Nothing has been rushed and multiple rounds of discussions between divisions and HHS occurred before the announcement. Every step taken has been deliberate, collaborative, and consistent with federal personnel policy and civil service protections,\" the spokesperson said. The spokesperson also defended changes to the agency, saying they \"are designed to strengthen the agency's capacity to serve the American public, not weaken it.\" Monday's suit is the latest legal action against the Trump administration'scost-cutting drive. Almost two dozen statessued HHS last monthfor cutting public health grants, and labor unions have sued the government over cuts to other agencies.

    "title": "Social Security to cut overpayment clawbacks to 50%, down from 100%",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 5, 2025 / 4:36 PM EDT/ CBS News The Social Security Administration is retreating from a recent policy change on the agency recovering overpayments that sparked concerns it could causefinancial hardshipfor tens of thousands of beneficiaries. In an April 25 \"emergency message\" to Social Security employees, the agency said it is reducing its overpayment clawback rate to 50% from 100%. The change comes after SSA on March 27 started recovering erroneous overpayments to Social Security recipients bytaking 100%of a beneficiary's monthly check until the money is repaid, up sharply from the prior rate of 10%. The agency didn't explain its reason for the change, nor immediately respond to a request for comment. The 100% clawback policy was directed by SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek, who has worked with Elon Musk'sDepartment of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, tocut costsat the agency. Dudek said in a March 7 press release that the change was needed to \"properly safeguard taxpayer funds.\" The agency's move to recover overpayments has long been a pain point for thousands of beneficiaries who are overpaid each year, with many people unaware they had received a bigger benefit than they were entitled to until receiving notices from the Social Security Administration. The agency's inspector generalfoundthat 73,000 overpayments in 2022 were due to problems with Social Security's own calculations, rather than the fault of the beneficiary. \"SSA's automated systems could not compute benefit payments due in certain situations, and the Agency did not provide employees with a comprehensive tool to use when they had to manually calculate them. Without adequate automation tools, employees can make errors,\" the inspector general said in a report. Last year, the Biden administrationcapped the clawback rateat 10% after reports that some seniors and disabled beneficiaries had been forced into financial hardship, includinghomelessness, due to the prior 100% clawback rate. But that 10% rate was only effective for about a year, with the the agency returning it to a 100% rate in March. Those most at risk from the government's stepped-up effort to recover overpayments are the roughlyone-third of Social Security recipientswho rely on their monthly benefit check for at least 75% of their income. Some seniors have told CBS News they were lefttoo financially strappedto afford rent, food and other basics. Many of the overpayments involve disabled workers who receive payments through the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program, whose recipients receive an average of $1,538 per month, said Dan Adcock, director of government relations and policy at the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. One SSAreportfound that SSDI has a higher rate of overpayments than the overall Social Security program because disabled recipients sometimes fail to report work income, which can occur if they're not aware they need to disclose extra earnings to the agency. Social Securityreduces benefitsfor disabled recipients who earn more than $1,620 a month. \"While walking back the clawback of overpayments from 100% to 50% is a step in the right direction, taking half of the monthly benefit will still be a burden to many workers with disabilities who receive SSDI,\" Adcock told CBS MoneyWatch. He added, \"A fifth of all SSDI beneficiaries rely on their benefits for almost all of their income. That means some SSDI recipients are still going to have trouble paying for rent, food, utilities and prescriptions\" with the 50% clawback rate. The Social Security Administration docked the the benefits of about 670,000 recipients by 10% for overpayment last year, according toKFF. Under the new rule, the 50% clawback for overpayments started April 25, according to the SSA's statement.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 5, 2025 / 4:25 PM EDT/ CBS News TheNational Institutes of Healthhas laid off hundreds more staff, multiple current and laid-off employees of the health agency told CBS News, including at its cancer research institute. Around 200 employees began receiving layoff notices Friday evening, said three people who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The move surprised NIH officials, since the department previously claimedno further cutswere planned at the agency. \"We thought the worst was behind us, and we were transitioning into this new phase, and the rug was just pulled out from underneath us,\" one laid-off employee said. A spokesperson for the NIH did not comment on why NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya sought the additional layoffs, referring an inquiry to the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the NIH. An HHS spokesperson said that, after a review, the department had notified additional employees that they were \"also impacted\" by the layoffs plan announced in March. Fewer than 250 employees at the department received notices, the spokesperson said. An HHS official said that \"the same number of employees will be brought back in critical areas\" elsewhere at the department. Two people said they had been told that the second round of cuts was done as part of an effort to compensate for other scientists needing to be reinstated, in order to comply withlayofftargets. \"The savings from these reductions will help redirect resources toward critical programs and strengthen our ability to serve the American people effectively. The goal is clear: reduce waste and maximize the impact of every taxpayer dollar,\" the HHS spokesperson, Andrew Nixon, said in a statement. Among the cuts on Friday were around 50 employees at the NIH's National Cancer Institute, or NCI. They had worked in the institute'sOffice of Communications and Public Liaisonoverseeing programs like theCancer Information Service, which provides answers to doctors and patients about cancer, and updates to databasessummarizingcancer information for healthcare providers. The layoff notices came a day after staff in that NCI communications office had met with top-ranking NIH leaders, to discuss drawing up plans to consolidate their staff into a new centralized communications arm across the agency. While several communications offices at the NIH's institutes had been gutted during an initial round of layoffs on April 1, NCI's team was spared. Only a handful of NCI staff had been laid off last month, two people said, including in the institute's human resources teams. \"Leadership was in the process of transferring some process and some of our media relations people over to NIH, because they were still getting press inquiries, but they couldn't handle the volume of inquiries that were coming through,\" the laid-off employee said.

    "title": "Vietnam 50 Years Later: Pauleen Le shares her family's immigration story",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 5, 2025 / 2:23 PM EDT/ CBS Minnesota The fall of Saigon 50 years ago markedthe end of the Vietnam War, and for WCCO's Pauleen Le, it marked the start of her family's immigration story to America — one that resonates with so many Minnesotan families. Le shares her story below. While decades have passed since the war's end, the pain and courage from that time is still very fresh for my parents. For my mom, her family's journey to the U.S. started 10 days before the fall of Saigon in 1975, when they escaped on a massive C-130 cargo plane the Americans sent to help refugees escape. All 10 of my mom's brothers and sisters, along with Grandma and Grandpa, flew to Wake Island, which was used as an American processing center during the end of the war. Each person was only allowed one personal bag and their birth certificates. There were also no goodbyes to loved ones they left behind, which included my mom, who was stuck in a small village with my great-grandmother. My mom would stay for another six years before she'd make it to the U.S.; forced to work in the labor camps the communists set up for the country's youth; watching as her beloved country changed and wondering if the government would figure out who she was; and whether she'd be punished since my grandfather worked for the American forces during the war as a translator and chauffeur. Interactive map: The journey of my mom's family As for the rest of my mom's family, they would spend three months at Fort Chaffee in Arkansas waiting for a sponsor. They had offers, but none were willing to take in a dozen people all at once, and they didn't want to be separated, so they waited. Then, First Baptist Church in Owego, New York, agreed to welcome all 12 in August 1975. It was big news for the small town. My grandpa and the family even made the local paper. Meanwhile, my dad fought alongside the Americans during the war in the South Vietnamese Navy. He was on his Navy ship at the time of the fall and his captain gave orders to sail out into the ocean for safety. After they realized South Vietnam had fallen to the communists, they knew they couldn't go back, even for just a brief moment, to say goodbye to family and friends. They just had to make a run for it. They sailed to Subic Bay, a U.S. Navy base in the Philippines, where they'd switch to an American ship and set sail for Guam. They weren't the only ones, as the front pages of the local newspapers captured the steady influx of refugees coming to the small island in the days and years following the fall. My dad would stay in Guam for 25 days. From there, he'd fly to Pennsylvania's Fort Indiantown Gap. A couple of weeks later, news arrived of a sponsor in Connecticut. Interactive map: My dad's journey My dad was alone in a new land, unfamiliar with the culture, the language, and with barely any money to his name. He had to leave both of his parents and six brothers and sisters behind in Vietnam. For four years, his family didn't know if he was dead or alive. That's how long it took for my dad to work up the courage to contact his family by mail. He was too afraid that his letters might get intercepted by the communist government and his family would pay the price for his escape. About two months after his first letter, my grandfather died from a stroke. My dad wasn't able to make it home to say goodbye for the funeral. It would be another decade before Vietnam would reopen for international travel.

    "title": "Vietnam 50 Years Later: MN welcomes war refugees with open arms",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 5, 2025 / 2:22 PM EDT/ CBS Minnesota The Vietnam Warstarted in 1955, nearly 8,000 miles away from the U.S. in the dense and remote jungles of South Vietnam. While the U.S. slowly deployed into Vietnam in the 1950s, the full deployment of combat units began in 1965. Fighting would soon spread to Laos and Cambodia, with the CIA recruiting and training thousands ofHmong peopleto fight on behalf of Americans during a clandestine operation in Laos known as the \"Secret War.\" But the effort to stop the spread of communism in Southeast Asia failed on April 30, 1975 with the fall of Saigon, when U.S. troops evacuated the country. According to the National Archive, more than 58,220 Americans were killed in the war. As many as 3.5 million Vietnamese people were killed, including soldiers on both sides of the conflict and civilians. More than 80,000Hmong soldiersand refugees also died, as did 20,000 Laotians. Minnesota has a rich history of welcoming refugees to the state, and were among the top 10 states across the country to do so following the war's end. In October 1975, Minnesota had received the highest number of Southeast Asian refugees in the Midwest, according to then-Gov. Wendell Anderson. But the governor was thinking, long-term, how would these refugees get the services they needed in the state? What kind of help would they need in the future? And how would they adapt and succeed in a place with a completely different culture and language? In December 1975, Anderson established the Indochinese Resettlement Office, which later became the Refugee Programs Office in 1981. The office worked with groups like Catholic Charities, Lutheran Social Services and the American Red Cross, along with local families, church groups and community organizations to sponsor refugee families and helped them settle into their new homes. Anderson also created the Indochinese Refugee Task Force to advise his office, which included representatives from social service organizations, the Vietnamese-American Association, the Cambodian refugee community, the departments of welfare, employment services and education, and the private sector. The task force had two main jobs: Collect data about Southeast Asian households in the state and provide information about classes, programs and recent laws to the refugee community. The task force would also later make efforts to address racial discrimination, hiring bias and language barriers that refugees faced when arriving in Minnesota. Best estimates showthat today in Minnesota, there are more than 16,000 Laotian immigrants; more than 33,000 Vietnamese immigrants; and nearly 12,000 Cambodian immigrants. And with nearly 95,000 Hmong immigrants, Minnesota is home to the largest concentration of Hmong in America.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 5, 2025 / 2:20 PM EDT/ CBS Minnesota Minnesota is built by immigrants who've enriched the state with diversity and innovation. One of those groups is theHmong community. Minnesota is home to the largest Hmong population in the country, and it all started nearly 50 years ago whenthe Vietnam War ended with the fall of Saigon. Months after the fall, Leng Wong fled his home of Laos months after serving as a military officer in the Lao Armed Forces during theSecret War, a clandestine operation wherethe CIA recruited and trained thousands of Hmong mento fight on behalf of the U.S. \"Flew missions into different parts of Laos, and I flew in American military operative, translate for them, talk to troops on the ground and relayed it to the American troops,\" Wong said. \"I was traveling with so they could relay it back to the base or the headquarter and call for support.\" Wong served for 10 years, until the bitter end was inevitable. He knew it was no longer safe for him to stay. \"They called us traitors, so they don't like us,\" he said. \"It was so chaotic that we really didn't have time to think much about it other than how to survive.\" He and his family escaped on one of the C-130 cargo planes the Americans had sent to help evacuate refugees. \"Just the clothes on our back. There was really nothing that we could bring with us,\" he said. They flew to Thailand, where they would stay for the next nine months. Then, news came of a sponsor. \"There was a lot of uncertainty, what I would be facing in a new land,\" Wong said. He arrived at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, in the bitter cold, on Feb. 7, 1976. \"I was having trouble catching my breath because it was so cold, and we're not used to that type of cold in our home country,\" he said. Frigid, and foreign, Wong was often met with a cold shoulder. He says his biggest barriers at first were language and culture. \"Initially, we were faced with some resentment from the community as well, thinking that we were here taking away services,\" he said. Even so, Wong still felt the need to help others just like him. He made it his aim to improve the lives of other Hmong people who would be following in his footsteps. \"I was able to communicate and translate for people, so I'd be busy day and night,\" he said. \"We'd be at the hospital, the clinic, at the airport.\" Wong would spend years working for refugee programs with Lutheran Social Services and the state, helping people find jobs and working with employers to create those jobs. He'd also advocate for policy changes in support of refugees, all while traveling across Minnesota, and eventually across the country, to break down barriers and to educate others on the Hmong people. These days, Wong owns several commercial buildings across the Twin Cities, and also has his sights set on building more affordable housing for all Minnesota families. \"I don't think I'll ever retire. I think I will continue to advocate for our community and to work and contribute back to our community, as well as the community at large,\" he said. Wong is a humble servant, forever thankful for the new land, and its people who accepted him. \"Minnesota's been good to me. It's always cold, but the people in Minnesota are warm hearts,\" he said. \"We know this is where we belong now, but we still have a part of our heart on the other side of the world that we know we belong there, too.\" EDITOR'S NOTE: Dang Her and his family were the first Hmong immigrants to come to Minnesota in November 1975,according to the Minnesota Historical Society. Leng Wong's family came as the first Hmong refugees in February 1976, according to the Hmong American Partnership.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 5, 2025 / 1:06 PM EDT/ CBS News The Department of Education says federalstudent loan borrowerswho do not pay on time could damage their credit scores and even have theirwages garnishedbeginning today, May 5 — causing challenges for some of the more than 5 million borrowers who are in default and struggling to get answers about their loans. \"I don't think anyone takes out a loan with the intention of not paying it back. It's how easily you can pay it back, that's the problem,\" said Jana Heartwood, who owes more than $40,000 instudent loansfrom her nursing degree. \"We're kind of drowning as it is,\" she said. Two years ago, Heartwood's son was born with a medical condition, and to treat it, Heartwood exhausted her savings and took out money from her 401K. During the pandemic, student loan payments were put into forbearance, but when repayments resumed last year, Heartwood said she was never notified. After hearing of the agency's collection decision from a news report, Heartwood checked her account and said she was shocked. \"I had no idea that my loans were delinquent at that point … I checked every email. I got statements that had a zero on it,\" she said. Persis Yu, an expert in student loan law, said steep job cuts at the Education Department, andsteps to dismantle it, have left the loan system in disarray. \"Borrowers cannot get answers from their servicers,\" said Yu. \"Many of the services have hours-long call wait times in order to get just a simple answer about, 'How much do I owe? How do I pay my loan?'\" After hours on the phone, Heartwood still had no clear answer on her loans, saying she can't afford to pay anything back right now. \"It's not easy. Every week is hard,\" she said. \"Every paycheck is immediately gone. It's gone before we even, you know, have it.\" The Department of Education's Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) is restarting collections on defaulted federal student loan on Monday, as a new analysis shows that delinquency rates are higher than ever. Yu said there are no provisions that take into consideration when families have extraordinary circumstances, like having to pay for the medical care of a loved one. \"It's an impossible standard for so many to meet and that's why so many borrowers do fall into default,\" she said. The Department of Education under President Trump blames the Biden administration. It told CBS News that because of \"attempts to transfer student debt to every taxpayer, the student loan portfolio is in a dire financial state.\" Student loans payments and interest accruals were paused in March 2020 by President Trump during the COVID-19 pandemic. Former President Joe Biden extended the halt of payments multiple times before theyresumed in October 2023. The Biden administrationsought to eliminate some student debt but faced multiple legal challenges from the courts, including a 2023 ruling from theSupreme Court. During the Biden administration, more than 5 million borrowers had their debt erased through various initiatives. GOP lawmakersrecently introduced legislation to overhaul the student loan repayment program, which includes eliminating theSAVEplan, created by the Biden administration in 2023. \"Going forward, the Department of Education, in conjunction with the Department of Treasury, will shepherd the student loan program responsibly and according to the law, which means helping borrowers return to repayment — both for the sake of their own financial health and our nation's economic outlook,\" Education Secretary Linda McMahonsaid in a statement last month, adding, \"There will not be any mass loan forgiveness.\" For impactedborrowers, experts advise taking detailed records and screenshots of their account status andpayments. They also suggest reaching out to your representative in Congress and asking specifically for casework help.

    "title": "Tariffs could put them under, some small business owners say",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 5, 2025 / 12:55 PM EDT/ CBS News Uncertainty around President Trump's ever-changing tariff agenda is alreadyhitting small businesseshard, and threatening their very survival, operators say. With baseline 10% taxes on all imported goods in effect andcountry-based levies looming, business operations have become significantly more challenging for the U.S.' nearly 35 million smaller enterprises, owners told CBS MoneyWatch. One of the most pressing challenges they face? Setting prices high enough to absorb the cost of new duties on imports without driving customers away. Thirty percent of small business owners surveyed by the National Federation of Independent Business in March said they planned to increase prices — the greatest share reported over the past year, an analysis by the Joint Economic Committee found.Raising pricesis one way to offset rising costs, while trimming expenses — including by reducing labor costs — is the other alternative. Employment at small businesses with fewer than 10 employees declined by 3% — or 366,400 jobs — since President Trump took office, the JEC found. That compares with a 1.2% increase in hiring by small businesses in the first months of President Biden's term, and a 0.1% decrease in the first months of President Trump's first term, the JEC found. Shayai Lucero, owner of Earth and Sky Floral Designs, a small floral design business in Laguna, New Mexico, said she imports a high volume of flowers from Canada, Columbia Ecuador and Peru. Because she's located in the desert, local farms and gardens can't produce flowers year-round. Lucero recently experienced what she called \"the sharpest price increase\" she's seen in her 16 years in the flower business, when the price of a single rose went from between 65 cents to 84 cents per stem to a range of $1.89 to $2.44. \"We received emails from several different farms we work with that said after Mother's Day the tariff prices are going to go into effect,\" Lucero told CBS MoneyWatch. She's increased her prices as a result, with wrist corsages typically sold for $40, now priced at $50. \"That's not nearly enough of what I should have charged, but because my clientele is not wealthy, I had to take that into account if would people purchase from me or would they go elsewhere?\" said Lucero, adding that as her own costs skyrocket, the future of her business is uncertain. \"I have been transparent with customers to try to get them to understand, but if it gets to be too much, I may have to close,\" she said. \"This is a whole different atmosphere.\" Few businesses are immune to tariffs, but smaller establishments, which tend to operate on thin margins, are among the most vulnerable. Some bigger businesses imported goods ahead of tariffs going into effect, stockpiling inventory. With less cash on hand, small businesses did not have the same ability. \"Small business owners are innovative, driven and scrappy — they often operate on razor-thin margins and are constantly finding new ways to grow,\" Sen. Maggie Hassan, ranking member of the Joint Economic Committee, said in a statement. \"But President Trump's tariffs are needlesslycausing immense uncertaintyfor small business owners, forcing them to make layoffs, increase prices for their customers and even close their doors,\" she added. Mike Roach, who co-owns Paloma Clothing, a 50-year-old womenswear store in Portland, Oregon, sells labels that are primarily manufactured in India and China. He placed orders for a new season's worth of merchandise three to five months ago, before tariffs on either country were in effect. Today, tariffs as high as 145% apply to goods from China, while a 10% baseline levy is in place on goods entering the U.S. from India. \"The companies we deal with are going through conniptions trying to figure out what they're going to do. At that level, Chinese goods, are pretty much unsaleable,\" he said. \"That's a huge threat to the future of our business.\" Roach hopes his store's 50th year in business isn't its last, but it's a potential reality he's facing. \"This is the worst and most uncertain situation we've ever been in,\" he said. \"This is way worse than anything else in terms of not knowing what to do and what the future is going to hold because of the uncertain factor.\" Megan Cerullo is a New York-based reporter for CBS MoneyWatch covering small business, workplace, health care, consumer spending and personal finance topics.

    "title": "At Social Security, these are the days of the living dead",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 5, 2025 / 5:00 AM EDT/ KFF Health News Rennie Glasgow, who has served 15 years at theSocial Security Administration, is seeing something new on the job: dead people. They're not really dead, of course. In four instances over the past few weeks, he told KFF Health News, his Schenectady, New York, office has seen people come in for whom \"there is no information on the record, just that they are dead.\" So employees have to \"resurrect\" them — affirm that they're living, so they can receive their benefits. Revivals were \"sporadic\" before, and there's been an uptick in such cases across upstate New York, said Glasgow. He is also an official with the American Federation of Government Employees, the union thatrepresented 42,000 Social Security employeesjust before the start of President Trump's second term. Martin O'Malley, who led the Social Security Administration toward the end of the Biden administration, said in an interview that he had heard similar stories during a recent town hall in Racine, Wisconsin. \"In that room of 200 people, two people raised their hands and said they each had a friend who was wrongly marked as deceased when they're very much alive,\" he said. It's more than just an inconvenience, because other institutions rely on Social Security numbers to do business, Glasgow said. Being declared dead \"impacts their bank account. This impacts their insurance. This impacts their ability to work. This impacts their ability to get anything done in society.\" \"They are terminating people's financial lives,\" O'Malley said. Though it's just one of the things advocates and lawyers worry about, these erroneous deaths come after a pair of initiatives from new leadership at the SSA to alter or update its databases of the living and the dead. Holders of millions of Social Security numbers have been marked as deceased. Separately, according to The Washington Post and The New York Times, thousands of numbers belonging to immigrants have been purged, cutting them off from banks and commerce, in an effort to encourage these people to \"self-deport.\" Glasgow said SSA employees received an agency email in April about the purge, instructing them how to resurrect beneficiaries wrongly marked dead. \"Why don't you just do due diligence to make sure what you're doing in the first place is correct?\" he said. The incorrectly marked deaths are just a piece of the Trump administration's crash program purporting to root out fraud, modernize technology, and secure the program's future. But KFF Health News' interviews with more than a dozen beneficiaries, advocates, lawyers, current and former employees, and lawmakers suggest the overhaul is making the agency worse at its primary job: sending checks to seniors, orphans, widows, and those with disabilities. Philadelphian Lisa Seda, who has cancer, has been struggling for weeks to sort out her 24-year-old niece's difficulties with Social Security's disability insurance program. There are two problems: first, trying to change her niece's address; second, trying to figure out why the program is deducting roughly $400 a month for Medicare premiums, when her disability lawyer — whose firm has a policy against speaking on the record — believes they could be zero. Since March, sometimes Social Security has direct-deposited payments to her niece's bank account and other times mailed checks to her old address. Attempting to sort that out has been a morass of long phone calls on hold and in-person trips seeking an appointment. Before 2025, getting the agency to process changes was usually straightforward, her lawyer said. Not anymore. The need is dire. If the agency halts the niece's disability payments, \"then she will be homeless,\" Seda recalled telling an agency employee. \"I don't know if I'm going to survive this cancer or not, but there is nobody else to help her.\" Some of the problems are technological. According to whistleblower information provided to Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, the agency's efforts to process certain data have been failing more frequently. When that happens, \"it can delay or even stop payments to Social Security recipients,\" the committee recentlytold the agency's inspector general. While tech experts and former Social Security officials warn about the potential for a complete system crash, day-to-day decay can be an insidious and serious problem, said Kathleen Romig, formerly of the Social Security Administration and its advisory board and currently the director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Beneficiaries could struggle to get appointments or the money they're owed, she said. For its more than 70 million beneficiaries nationwide, Social Security is crucial. More than a third of recipients said they wouldn't be able to afford necessities if the checks stopped coming, according toa January surveyfrom the National Academy of Social Insurance. Advocates and lawyers say lately Social Security is failing to deliver, to a degree that's nearly unprecedented in their experience. Carolyn Villers, executive director of the Massachusetts Senior Action Council, said two of her members' March payments were several days late. \"For one member that meant not being able to pay rent on time,\" she said. \"The delayed payment is not something I've heard in the last 20 years.\" When KFF Health News presented the agency with questions, Social Security officials passed them off to the White House. White House spokesperson Elizabeth Huston referred to Mr. Trump's \"resounding mandate\" to make government more efficient. \"He has promised to protect social security, and every recipient will continue to receive their benefits,\" Huston said in an email. She did not provide specific, on-the-record responses to questions. Complaints about missed payments are mushrooming. The Arizona attorney general's office had received approximately 40 complaints related to delayed or disrupted payments by early April, spokesperson Richie Taylor told KFF Health News. A Connecticut agency assisting people on Medicare said complaints related to Social Security — which often helps administer payments and enroll patients in the government insurance program primarily for those over age 65 — had nearly doubled in March compared with last year. Lawyers representing beneficiaries say that, while the historically underfunded agency has always had its share of errors and inefficiencies, it's getting worse as experienced employees have been let go. \"We're seeing more mistakes being made,\" said James Ratchford, a lawyer in West Virginia with 17 years' experience representing Social Security beneficiaries. \"We're seeing more things get dropped.\" What gets dropped, sometimes, are records of basic transactions. Kim Beavers of Independence, Missouri, tried to complete a periodic ritual in February: filling out a disability update form saying she remains unable to work. But her scheduled payments in March and April didn't show. She got an in-person appointment to untangle the problem — only to be told there was no record of her submission, despite her showing printouts of the relevant documents to the agency representative. Beavers has a new appointment scheduled for May, she said. Social Security employees frequently cite missing records to explain their inability to solve problems when they meet with lawyers and beneficiaries. A disability lawyer whose firm's policy does not allow them to be named had a particularly puzzling case: One client, a longtime Social Security disability recipient, had her benefits reassessed. After winning on appeal, the lawyer went back to the agency to have the payments restored — the recipient had been going without since February. But there was nothing there. \"To be told they've never been paid benefits before is just chaos, right? Unconditional chaos,\" the lawyer said. Researchers and lawyers say they have a suspicion about what's behind the problems at Social Security: the Elon Musk-led effort to revamp the agency. Some 7,000 SSA employees have reportedly been let go; O'Malley has estimated that 3,000 more would leave the agency. \"As the workloads go up, the demoralization becomes deeper, and people burn out and leave,\" he predicted in anApril hearingheld by House Democrats. \"It's going to mean that if you go to a field office, you're going to see a heck of a lot more empty, closed windows.\" The departures have hit the agency's regional payment centers hard. These centers help process and adjudicate some cases. It's the type of behind-the-scenes work in which \"the problems surface first,\" Romig said. But if the staff doesn't have enough time, \"those things languish.\" Languishing can mean, in some cases, getting dropped by important programs like Medicare. Social Security often automatically deducts premiums, or otherwise administers payments, for the health program. Lately, Melanie Lambert, a senior advocate at the Center for Medicare Advocacy, has seen an increasing number of cases in which the agency determines beneficiaries owe money to Medicare. The cash is sent to the payment centers, she said. And the checks \"just sit there.\" Beneficiaries lose Medicare, and \"those terminations also tend to happen sooner than they should, based on Social Security's own rules,\" putting people into a bureaucratic maze, Lambert said. Employees' technology is more often on the fritz. \"There's issues every single day with our system. Every day, at a certain time, our system would go down automatically,\" said Glasgow, of Social Security's Schenectady office. Those problems began in mid-March, he said. The new problems leave Glasgow suspecting the worst. \"It's more work for less bodies, which will eventually hype up the inefficiency of our job and make us, make the agency, look as though it's underperforming, and then a closer step to the privatization of the agency,\" he said.

    "title": "DHS to pay $1,000 to undocumented immigrants who self-deport",
    "article_text": "The Department of Homeland Security is intensifying its efforts to persuade unauthorized immigrants to self-deport by offering a $1,000 stipend and travel assistance. The federal agencyannounced Mondaythat those who use theCBP Home appto voluntarily leave the United States will receive assistance \"to facilitate travel back to their home country\" and $1,000 \"paid after their return to their home country has been confirmed through the app.\" The announcement comes asthe number of deportationshasremained stagnantduringPresident Donald Trump's first 100 days in office.One of the president's key campaign promiseswas that he would enact mass deportations as soon as he took office. DHS did not immediately respond to questions about how the funds would be provided or what proof would be required to show the person had returned to their home country. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in late March that those who are self-deporting can use biographical data, documents, facial images and geo location in the app to prove that they have left the country. “The alien must be at least three miles outside of the United States to successfully utilize this feature,”she said. “While the use of the verify departure functionality is optional, if the alien chooses to use it, they must submit a facial image. It's required.” Ina press release, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said self-deportations are \"the best, safest and most cost-effective way to leave the United States to avoid arrest.\" A single deportation costs U.S. taxpayers $17,121, according to DHS. The federal agency expects self-deportations to decrease that cost by 70%, even after factoring in the stipend. So far this year,at least 5,000 immigrantshave reportedly used CBP Home to say that they were voluntarily leaving the country, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington think tank. DHS has declined to say how many unauthorized immigrants have used the app so far to self-deport. According to Appfigures, a company that tracks app downloads, CBP Home app has recently been downloaded about 1,500 times per day. Since the start of 2025, the app was downloaded about 300,000 times, according to the company’s CEO, Ariel Michaeli. In March,the Trump administration repurposed the Biden-eraCBP One appthat allowed migrants to enter the U.S. legally as asylum-seekers, changing it into theCBP Home app. This version of the mobile application has a self-deportation reporting feature. The Trump administration hasspent $200 million in revamping the appand creating an accompanying advertising campaign featuring Noem to promote the app's use. Theads, which have aired in English and Spanishacross the U.S.and Mexico, encourage immigrants who are not legally present in the U.S. to leave the country. As part of their announcement Monday, DHS said that undocumented immigrants who \"submit their intent to voluntarily self-deport in CBP Home will also be deprioritized for detention and removal ahead of their departure as long as they demonstrate they are making meaningful strides in completing that departure.\" The agency also said that self-deportation through the app \"may help preserve the option for an illegal alien to re-enter the United States legally in the future,\" echoing key points Noem touts in her ads. Immigration experts and advocateshave previously warned of Noem’s self-deportation messageand the possibility of being able to legally return to the U.S. “The operative word in that quote from the secretary is ‘may,’” Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst with the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute,told NBC News in March. “For many people who leave the United States, there may never be a lawful option for return to the United States, or reentry may be barred for many years,” Heidi Altman, the vice president of policy at the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy organization,told NBC News in a statement in March. “Forcing or coercing people into leaving their homes and their loved ones carries political, moral, and economic costs.”",

    "title": "Trump's call to reopen Alcatraz as a prison could be stymied by roadblocks",
    "article_text": "In its heyday, Alcatraz Island housed more than 260 prisoners, with notorious gangsters such asAl Capone,George \"Machine Gun\" KellyandJames \"Whitey\" Bulgerserving time on the rocky outpost. With its closing in 1963 after it fell into disrepair, the federal prison off San Francisco found a new life as a popular tourist destination — one that continues to draw more thana million visitors a yearas anational historic landmark. That could all change again if President Donald Trump gets his way. Trumpwrote Sunday on socialmediathat he is directing the federal Bureau of Prisons, the Justice Department and other agencies to \"reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt Alcatraz\" to the most \"ruthless and violent offenders.\" But federal corrections experts and historians caution that while such a project may be especially \"symbolic\" to Trump, any plan would be incredibly expensive and inefficient, particularly when thefederal government's mission is to slash spendingand prisons remain strained by staffing shortages. \"You'd be going in and basically removing a national landmark just to set up a prison that literally would be for the optics mostly, because it doesn't make the most sense financially to establish something like that there,\" said Michael Esslinger, who has written five books about Alcatraz's history and estimates he has visited the island at least 500 times. The National Park Service manages Alcatraz. J. Elizabeth Peace, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of the Interior, said in an email that \"the President's statement speaks for itself,\" and declined to comment further. Before Alcatraz was closed, it was determined that it would take at least $4 million to renovate it and that the physical isolation of the island was a major reason it cost so much to maintain. For example, fresh water had to be barged to the island every week. In a news release issued in 1962, BOP Director James Bennett said it was not an \"economically sound policy\" to invest millions of dollars to rehab Alcatraz. Housing an inmate in Alcatraz cost more than three times what it cost in Atlanta, the BOP said. It's unclear how much it would cost to build a new prison on Alcatraz from scratch. The BOP's newly installed director, William Marshall III, said in a statement Monday that he has ordered an assessment on \"next steps\" for a reopened U.S. penitentiary. \"USP Alcatraz has a rich history,\" Marshall said. \"We look forward to restoring this powerful symbol of law, order, and justice. We will be actively working with our law enforcement and other federal partners to reinstate this very important mission.\" For comparison, a new federal prison that would hold 1,400 inmatesinLetcher County, Kentucky,near the Virginia border, is estimated to cost more than $500 million. Walter Pavlo, president of the consulting firm Prisonology LLC, whose experts include former BOP case managers and wardens, said he could easily see the price of rebuilding a prison on Alcatraz surpassing that of the Kentucky facility. In addition, there are other costs associated with operating a maximum-security facility that requires state-of-the art technology and infrastructure, particularly for a property that has had a long and colorfulhistory of escape attempts. Federal prisons are typically built in isolated and rural communities. Having one in the San Francisco Bay Area,one of the most expensive placesto live in the country, would require competitive salaries, as well, Pavlo said. He said those corrections officers and staff members would need to be experienced in dealing with dangerous offenders. The BOP currently houses such prisoners at its\"Supermax\" in Florence, Colorado,south of Colorado Springs. Trump \"wants a showplace for high-profile criminals that people can see,\" Pavlo said. \"And there's no higher-profile place than Alcatraz.\" Some elected officials in California are downplaying Trump's plan to revert Alcatraz into a working prison. \"It is now a very popular national park and major tourist attraction,\" Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the former House speaker, whose district includes the island,said on X. \"The President's proposal is not a serious one.\" The idea began taking shape after Trump took office for his second term. His son Donald Trump Jr.posted on Xthat \"maybe we should also reopen Alcatraz?!?!\" in response to his father's announcing preparations for a facility at the U.S. military camp at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, tohouse thousands of migrants. In 1981, the Reagan administration also examined Alcatraz as a place to holddetainees fleeing Cuba via the Mariel boatlift, but the idea was rejected because the island did not have the proper resources and, by then, it was a magnet for tourists. Alcatraz's operations began in the mid-19th century, first as a military fort to house prisoners, until the federal governmenttransferred it to the Justice Department. The federal prison opened in 1934. Over the years, Alcatraz — nicknamed The Rock — was the scene of dramatic escapes and adeadly siege by inmates. Its purpose was \"really a way to isolate inmates from the news and from society,\" Esslinger said. \"It was kind of like this iron curtain where no information was going in or out.\" But Alcatraz was ultimately not worth maintaining. In 1962, ahead of the prison's closing, the BOP determined the salt air was severely corroding the building. Meanwhile, the lack of a sewage system meant wastewater was being dumped directly into the bay. The island gained national attention again in 1969 when a group ofNative American activists occupied ituntil 1971. David Widner, whose uncles, convicted bank robbers John and Clarence Anglin,escaped from Alcatrazin 1962, said that given the island's lore and public fascination, \"it would make sense for it to remain the way it is.\" \"But do I think Trump's capable of turning it around? Sure,\" Widner said. \"With the right kind of money, it could be redone.\"",

    "article_text": "Months after massage therapists accused kicker Justin Tucker of misconduct, the Baltimore Ravens announced Monday they were releasing him from the team, calling it a tough decision based on the team's current roster. Tucker, 35, who has been with the team since 2012, was accused in January of inappropriate behavior during massage therapy sessions by six women who spoketo The Baltimore Banner. The news outletreported allegations of more womenthe next month. Tucker, who is one of the most accurate kickers in NFL history,has denied any wrongdoing, and he has not been charged with any crime. An NFL investigation into the allegations of misconduct continues,NBC Sports reported. The Ravens last month drafted a kicker, Tyler Loop, in the sixth round. Ravens Executive Vice President and General Manager Eric DeCosta made no mention of the allegations inMonday's statementabout Tucker's release. Ravens coach John Harbaugh has said any decision about Tucker's place on the team would be based on football,NFL.com reported. “Sometimes football decisions are incredibly difficult, and this is one of those instances,\" DeCosta said in Monday's statement reporting that Tucker would be released. \"Considering our current roster, we have made the tough decision to release Justin Tucker.\" DeCosta thanked Tucker for his contributions to the Ravens, and he highlighted Tucker's \"reliability, focus, drive, resilience and extraordinary talent.” Tucker, who boasts a success rate of 89.1% on field goals and is the most accurate all time among players with at least 100 attempts, did encounter some kicking strugglesduring the 2024 season. He has called the allegations in the Banner “unequivocally false.” “In accusing me of misconduct, the article takes innocuous, or ambiguous, interactions and skews them so out of proportion they are no longer recognizable, and it presents vague insinuations as fact,” hesaid in a statementin January. “This is desperate tabloid fodder.” DeCosta thanked Tucker and said the team wishes him and his family well. “We are grateful for Justin’s many contributions while playing for the Ravens,” DeCosta said. “We sincerely wish him and his family the very best in this next chapter of their lives.” The Ravens signed Tucker as a free agent in 2012. He was named to the Pro Bowl seven times and is a Super Bowl champion, having won the Super Bowl with the Ravens at the end of the 2012 season.",

    "title": "Sean 'Diddy' Combs tells judge, 'I’m a little nervous,' on first day of jury selection in his sex-trafficking trial",
    "article_text": "Nearly three dozen New Yorkers were questioned Monday about what they knew about the federal sex trafficking case against Sean “Diddy” Combs as jury selection got underway in a Manhattan courtroom. Prospective jurors were also shown a list of more than 100 places and people whose names may come up at trial and were asked whether they knew any of the people and whether it would affect their ability to be impartial.The list included celebrities such as Michael B. Jordan, Mike Myers and Kanye West, none of whom are implicated in the case. The names of women who have filed civil lawsuits against Combs also appeared on the list, including his former girlfriend Casandra Ventura,whose suit paved the wayfor the sex trafficking and racketeering charges,andDawn Richard, a member of two now-defunct musical groups Combs had formed. Richardalleged in a suit filed last yearthat he had groped and threatened her and that she had witnessed him assaulting Ventura. Combs has denied her allegations, and her suit is pending. The attorneys did not provide an explanation for the list, and representatives for Jordan, Myers and West did not immediately return requests for comment. Also Monday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey said prosecutors have had trouble getting in touch with the attorney for a woman identified only as Victim-3 in the indictment against Combs and that they were unsure whether she would show up to court even if they tried to enforce a subpoena. Twelve jurors will ultimately decide whether Combs used his power and influence to sexually exploit women for more than two decades, asfederal prosecutors allegein the five-count indictment. Sporting a goatee, Combs, who has beendetained at a federal prison in Brooklynsince his September 2024 arrest, arrived for the first day of jury selection dressed in a white collared shirt, black crewneck sweater and charcoal-colored pants. U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian gave Combs permission to wear his own clothes during the trial. He hugged and shook hands with his attorneys before Subramanian issued various rulings, including that Dr. Elie Aoun, a clinical psychiatrist, can testify as an expert for the defense about drugs Combs may have taken and their combined effects. Subramanian said Aoun could also testify about blackouts and other episodes in which Combs may have been intoxicated. At the heart of the government’s case are allegations that Combs forced women — includinghis former girlfriend Ventura— to participate in drug-fueled sexual encounters with male sex workers that Combs directed and filmed and called “freak offs.” The indictment does not name any victims, but the allegations of Victim-1 closely align with those Ventura made in a 2023 civil lawsuit that she and Combs settled within a day without him admitting any wrongdoing. The public first learned about the alleged sexual encounters from her lawsuit, which alleged Combs had abused her for years. Combs has vehemently denied the allegations, and his attorneys have said the sex was consensual. But prosecutors say those encounters amounted to sex trafficking and allege Combs kept recordings of the encounters and silenced victims through blackmail and violence. Central to the prosecution’s case isa video from March 5, 2016, showing Combs attacking and dragging Ventura in a Los Angeles hotel hallway. Prosecutors have said that Ventura, who was signed to Combs’ music label as Cassie, had been trying to escape the hotel room and that the events of that day “are powerful evidence of trafficking” and of Combs’ “use of force in connection with a freak off,” which they allege preceded the assault. Combs was wearing only a towel in the video and Ventura did not have shoes on. After CNN aired the video last year, Combs apologized publicly, saying his behavior in it was “inexcusable” and that he took full responsibility for his actions. According to prosecutors, Combs bribed hotel security with $100,000 to obtain the footage and cover up what he had done. Combs’ attorneys had sought to exclude the video from evidence, arguing it “is wholly inaccurate, having been altered, manipulated, sped-up, and edited to be out of sequence” — claimsCNN has forcefully denied. When questioned by Subramanian on Monday, a number of prospective jurors said they had seen the video, with one woman referring to it as “damning.” The woman was excused. Another woman, who said she works for HBO, said she found the video “disturbing” and “upsetting” but that she could be impartial. Combs’ lead attorney, Marc Agnifilo, expressed concern because HBO released a documentary about Combs titled “The Fall of Diddy” that the woman said she was unaware of. After another prospective juror said she had been caught stealing a wand from a Harry Potter store, Combs nodded in apparent approval to his attorneys. Throughout the day, as potential jurors were questioned, he appeared to express his approval or disapproval, either with a nod or by shaking his head no. Another woman disclosed she had liked a video on social media of a comedian who made a joke about Combs and baby oil because she thought it was funny. Prosecutors have said that when Combs’ homes in Los Angeles and Miami Beach, Florida, were raided last year,federal agents seized more than 1,000 bottles of baby oiland lubricant. Both women were allowed to stay. When the defense asked for a quick bathroom break, Subramanian suggested they wait and continue questioning jurors. “I’m a machine,” Subramanian said, to which Combs responded: “I’m sorry, your honor, I’m a little nervous today.” Subramanian granted the break. Subramanian said last week that he hoped to seat a jury of 12 people and six alternates in three days for the trial, which is expected to last eight weeks. Her father, high-profile defense lawyer Mark Geragos, was also in court Monday. “Can’t I just watch my daughter? I’m a helicopter parent,” he said jokingly as he entered court. A source familiar with the case told NBC News that Mark Geragos will help throughout the trial in an unofficial role and will advise Combs’ legal team this week on which jurors to choose. He was seen Monday in court conferring with the defense’s jury consultant. Mark Geragos had no further comment, and Combs’ legal team did not respond to a request for comment. The jurors will remain anonymous.",

    "title": "Trump administration says Harvard will receive no new grants until it meets White House demands",
    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — Harvard University will receive no new federal grants until it meets a series of demandsfrom President Donald Trump’s administration, the Education Department announced Monday. The action was laid out in a letter toHarvard’s presidentand amounts to a major escalation of Trump’sbattle with the Ivy League school. The administration previously froze $2.2 billion in federal grants to Harvard, and Trump is pushing tostrip the schoolof its tax-exempt status. Harvard has pushed back on the administration’s demands, setting up a closely watched clash in Trump’s attempt toforce change at universitiesthat he says have become hotbeds of liberalism and antisemitism. In a press call, an Education Department official said Harvard will receive no new federal grants until it “demonstrates responsible management of the university” and satisfies federal demands on a range of subjects. It applies to federal research grants and not federal financial aid students receive to help cover tuition and fees. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to preview the decision on a call with reporters. Follow live politics coverage here The official accused Harvard of “serious failures” in four areas: antisemitism, racial discrimination, abandonment of rigor and viewpoint diversity. To become eligible for new grants, Harvard would need to enter negotiations with the federal government and prove it has satisfied the administration’s demands. The administration has demanded a series of changes to campus policy, includingreforms to crack down on protestersand pursue more viewpoint diversity among faculty. In a letter Monday to Harvard’s president, Education Secretary Linda McMahon accused the school of enrolling foreign students who showed contempt for the U.S. “Harvard University has made a mockery of this country’s higher education system,” McMahon wrote. Harvard’s president has previously said he will not bend to government’s demands. The university sued to halt its funding freeze last month. Harvard’s suit called the funding freeze “arbitrary and capricious,” saying it violated its First Amendment rights and the statutory provisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. The Trump administration said previously that Harvard would need to meet a series of conditions to keep almost$9 billionin grants and contracts. The school in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has an endowment of $53 billion, the largest in the country. Across the university, federal money accounted for 10.5% of revenue in 2023, not counting financial aid such as grants and student loans.",

    "title": "Former official targeted by Trump says the president is trying to silence critics",
    "article_text": "A former Homeland Security official whom President Donald Trump accused of potentially “treasonous” conduct fears he is under federal investigation and plans to challenge what he calls an illegal attempt to silence critics. In an exclusive interview with NBC News, Miles Taylor said that he is prepared to “fight back” in court and that his repeated warnings that Trump would use presidential power to retaliate against perceived political enemies have proved accurate. “My concern was he would turn the government into a revenge machine, and that’s what’s happening,” Taylor said. Since the presidentsigned a memorandumlast month calling for a review of Taylor’s conduct as a Department of Homeland Security official during Trump’s first term, government authorities have contacted former high school classmates and others associated with him, Taylor said. “I have seen indications that they are out there, rummaging through my past, talking to people as far back as high school and trying to comb through my life,” he said. It was unclear what the focus of the federal investigation was or which government agency was carrying it out, Taylor and his lawyer said. The Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security declined to comment. During his tenure in Trump’s first administration, Taylor wrote ananonymous op-edsaying many senior administration officials were trying to limit Trump’s worst impulses and protect the country’s democratic institutions from a president who he said lacked a moral compass. Taylor later wrote an anonymous memoir before he went public and opposed Trump’s re-election in 2020. In aDecember interviewwith NBC News’ “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker, Trump said he would not direct the Justice Department to investigate his political foes. Asked by Welker inan interviewthat aired Sunday what has changed, Trump replied, \"Well, no, I just look at people, and I’m not directing anybody.\" Taylor denied any wrongdoing and said he is being singled out for expressing his opinion. “I know I’ve never broken the law. I know that I’ve assiduously upheld my national security obligations,” he said. “What’s really important for people to know is you don’t need a permission slip in the United States to criticize the president.” Given his track record criticizing Trump, Taylor said he expected to be called out by the president at some point. But he said the memorandum has turned his family’s life upside down, forcing him to effectively stop working as a cybersecurity consultant and requiring his wife to go back to work earlier than planned after the birth of their baby. They have adopted additional safety precautions because of online threats and vitriol directed at Taylor and updated their wills on the advice of security experts, he said. “My wife has to read online about people saying that they’ll put me in front of a firing squad,” Taylor said. Meanwhile, some friends are now reluctant to be associated with him to avoid any blowback. “People are scared to even talk to you because they’re worried they’ll lose their livelihoods,” he said. Although Taylor said his public stance against Trump has come at a personal and professional cost, he said he and his wife have not considered trying to seek a discreet settlement with the administration. “Of course, it never crossed our minds that we would try to go settle,” Taylor said. “And what I worry about is that they will try to use this tactic, this bludgeon of the bully pulpit of the presidency, to go shut people up by threatening them and getting them to settle with the White House, like they’ve gotten businesses to settle, like they’re trying to get universities to settle.” Taylor added: “That is insidious; that is un-American. You can’t threaten Americans to not exercise their First Amendment rights because they’re fearful the president of the United States will prosecute them.” Another former senior official who served in Trump’s first term and was the subject of a similar presidential memo, Chris Krebs, is under an unspecified federal law enforcement investigation, the Department of Homeland Securitysaid last week. Krebs declined to comment. Trump targeted Taylor and Krebs in two memos issued April 9 revoking their security clearances and ordering the attorney general to review their actions in government. Krebs, as a top cybersecurity official,refuted Trump's false claimsthat the 2020 election was “rigged” and said at the time that there was no evidence of major fraud or vote tampering. In his memorandum, Trump described Taylor as an “egregious leaker” whose actions were possibly “treasonous” and potentially a violation of the Espionage Act. But Taylor said that he has always abided by the law and upheld national security and that criticizing the president was not a crime. Taylor’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said the president’s memo is an unprecedented, unconstitutional attempt to use executive authority to target an American citizen. He and Taylor’s legal team were weighing a legal response and would not necessarily wait for the government to take the first step in court, Lowell said. “I think what we’ve seen across the last 100 days is that people are finding that they can ask the courts to be the protectors of the rule of law when it is appropriate,” Lowell told NBC News. “They’re becoming proactive and asking the courts to rule in advance. And that’s something that we’re looking at. “ Lowell, who has represented an array of clients, including Hunter Biden and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, said he hopes judges will protect his client’s civil liberties and be wary of any potentially improper request from administration investigators. “I don’t think it stops with Miles, but I think Miles is a good test case if the system works,” he said.",

    "title": "Beloved Florida indie bookstore faces backlash after removal of LGBTQ titles",
    "article_text": "Staff members at Bodacious Bookstore & Café, an independent bookstore in Pensacola, Florida, say that when they were instructed to remove LGBTQ titles from the shelves, some refused, while others resigned in protest or quietly hid queer books to protect them. “I started working at Bodacious because I love books and being surrounded by stories and knowledge,” said a former employee, who asked to remain anonymous because she fears retaliation from the bookstore’s owners. She said she began crying when Beth O’Connor, the bookstore’s interim manager, directed her to remove LGBTQ books. When she refused, the former employee said, O’Conner sent her home and told her to re-evaluate whether she wanted to work at the store. “It was heartbreaking to see us removing them — especially starting with LGBTQ+ titles,” the former employee said. O’Connor didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Book censorship has reachedhistoric highs over the past several years, with titles centered on LGBTQ issues and queer characters among the most banned and challenged in public schools and libraries. Independent bookstores have been dependable holdouts amid the growing conservative push, with many proudly featuring “Banned Book” sections, but in Florida’s Escambia County — arguablyground zero for the country’s book censorship battle— even a beloved indie bookstore isn’t immune. Bodacious Bookstore & Café is in Pensacola, the largest city in Escambia, Florida’s westernmost county, which is on the Alabama border. The county, which made headlines last year after itsschool district pulled 1,600 book titles from shelves, also sits at the center of two federal lawsuits on book censorship. Thefirst suit— filed in May 2023 by the nonprofit organization PEN America, Penguin Random House and a group of authors and parents — argues that the Escambia County School District’s initial removal of over 150 books, many of them addressing topics related to LGBTQ issues or race, violates students’ First Amendment rights. The suit is ongoing. Thesecond lawsuit, also filed in 2023, challenges the school district’s removal of the children’s book “And Tango Makes Three,” about two male penguins who raise a chick together. In September, the school district in that suitagreed to return three dozen booksrelated to race and the LGBTQ community to shelves as part of a settlement agreement. Now, many of the same stories are under scrutiny at Bodacious Bookstore & Café, owned by businessman and philanthropist Quint Studer and his wife, Mary “Rishy” Studer. According to one current and three former employees, management began reviewing all store materials after receiving a complaint from a customer against profanity on a greeting card. They said that what began as a purge of purportedly profane materials, including greeting cards, stickers and book titles with swear words, quickly escalated into the quiet removal of more than 60 books from the store. Roughly half of the books that were removed, the current and former employees said, featured queer stories or authors, including celebrity memoirs like Billie Jean King’s “All In” and Elliot Page’s “Pageboy,” as well as young adult novels like Casey McQuiston’s “I Kissed Shara Wheeler” and Alice Oseman’s popular “Heartstopper” series. Others included sex education books, popular young adult romances that don’t feature romance between LGBTQ main characters, such as “The Summer I Turned Pretty” by Jenny Han, and even books about the history of book banning. Quint Studer and Studer Entertainment & Retail President Jonathan Griffith declined an interview. On Monday, Travis Peterson, a spokesperson for the Studers, said in a statement on behalf of the bookstore that it removed greeting cards that featured profanity because they were “inconsistent with our brand values.” “We also began a thorough review of our inventory to ensure that books with explicit or graphic sexual content were not easily accessible to young children,” the statement read, adding that the review is ongoing. The statement continued: “At no time were any books removed because of LGBTQ+ (or any other) subject matter, authorship, or genre. Any assertion to the contrary is not true, especially if made by former employees who are no longer involved with our operations. We stand by our decision as a privately owned bookstore to determine what titles and merchandise are suitable for our shelves or easily accessible by young children. Our goal is to be a welcoming place for every child and every family, and we believe that means not prominently displaying books and merchandise with profanity or explicit content.” Bodacious Bookstore denied in astatement on Instagramlast week that any specific categories are being banned. However, it said it “did temporarily pull some titles for review.” “While many have returned to the shelves or been relocated to more appropriate sections, some will not return as we adjust our offerings,” the statement read. Nichole Murphy had been a volunteer at Bodacious Bookstore since 2023 helping to facilitate book clubs and community events. She had just begun working at the store on April 2 when, just six days later, the book removals started, she said. Murphy said she was on the floor the day management began pulling LGBTQ titles from the shelves. She refused to participate in the removals themselves, she said, but was then directed to delete the titles from the store’s inventory system, which she reluctantly did. She spoke out, informing management that the exclusive removal of LGBTQ titles was discriminatory and that it violated the company’s own core mission, vision and values of inclusion and integrity, she said. In resistance, she hid queer books and documented each title removed from the system. “I refused to pull any books from the shelves. There were never criteria for the books being removed,” she said. “Management started pulling anything that looked queer — books with pictures of two girls kissing on the cover or romance books with main characters that have the same pronouns. These were not sexually explicit or profane materials.” Murphy, the former employee who asked to remain anonymous, and a current employee who requested anonymity due to fears of retaliation from the Studers, said O’Connor told them that she had a meeting with Rishy Studer, who, O’Connor said, told her to remove the LGBTQ books. O’Conner told the employees that Studer also directed her to then pull the witchcraft books, which the former employees say was an attempt to disguise the targeted queer removals. Murphy resigned on April 22, and books were still being removed up until her last day, she said. At least five of the bookstore’s 10 staff members, including Murphy, told NBC News they have resigned since the books began to be removed. Regarding the meeting between O’Connor and Rishy Studer, Quint Studer said in an email that Rishy “never mentioned any specific titles or categories” and that “all conversations regarded language in the children’s area.” O’Connor didn’t respond to a request for comment about the meeting. According to Melissa Smith, the former manager of Bodacious Bookstore who resigned on April 28 over the store’s alleged censorship practices, it isn’t the first time LGBTQ books have been targeted. Smith, who joined Bodacious in 2021, took pride in building its book club community and ensuring the store offered diverse and representative reading materials. She wasn’t in the store when the most recent removals began, as she had been on family and medical leave since early March. However, in July 2022, while she was out on vacation, she said, the store implemented a stealthy policy to exclude LGBTQ books from the children’s section after a customer complaint about the book “Melissa” by Alex Gino, about a young transgender girl. Despite the policy, one book, “My Mommies Love Me,” was mistakenly ordered for Mother’s Day and quickly pulled last month during the broader removal of queer titles, according to Murphy and the two former staffers. “I even created a banned-book section in the store in February because of customers’ demand for these titles,” Smith said. “That’s the whole point of books: to either see yourself represented or understand someone else’s experience. While the bookstore maintains it isn’t banning books or LGBTQ content, vetting books only to create a “family-friendly” space, Murphy and the two employees who asked to be anonymous also reported the removal of queer greeting cards and pride stickers, includinga Mother’s Day cardthat was mistakenly identified as representing a queer family. Several former employees, authors and community members have questioned whether the definition of “family friendly” includes LGBTQ families. Young adult author Ginny Myers Sain was scheduled to visit the store on April 26 for National Independent Bookstore Day to promote her new release, “When the Bones Sing.” However, she canceled her appearance after the store failed to clarify which books were being targeted for removal and what qualified as “family friendly,” later posting awidely shared statement on Facebookcondemning the shop for censorship. “We expect independent bookstores to be leading the charge against this sort of thing, not leaning into it,” she told NBC News. “Readers are counting on us. As someone who writes for teens, I feel that obligation particularly deeply. All kids deserve to be able to walk into their local bookstore and see themselves reflected and celebrated in the books they find there. And everyone knows that, in history, the people banning books have never been the good guys.” According to former employees, bookstore management is using the nonprofit organization Common Sense Media to vet titles for removal or potential return to the shelves. While educators, librarians and families commonly use the platform to evaluate age ratings in books and media, Murphy and one of the employees who asked to be anonymous argue that it was never intended as a tool to restrict access to books. It remains unclear whether employees will be permitted to special-order queer books or other titles no longer carried in the store, as many report that all orders now require management approval. “My manager told me that as a private business, they don’t have to sell or cater to certain people, implying queer families can shop elsewhere,” said the current employee who requested anonymity. “From both a political and business standpoint, I think it was a stupid decision to pull the books, because that’s actually more political than not pulling them.” The employee said none of the removed titles have been returned to shelves, though the Studers contradicted that both in their public statements and to NBC News.",

    "title": "Trump restricts funding for 'gain-of-function' research — calling it dangerous",
    "article_text": "Rob Stein Gain-of-function research, became especially controversial and politically polarized during the COVID-19 pandemic.  One theory states the SARS-CoV2 virus spilled out of a Chinese laboratory in Wuhan, China.Feature China/Future Publishing/Getty Imageshide caption President Trump issued an executive order Monday restricting federal funding for research that involves a controversial field of scientific study known as \"gain-of-function\" research. The research, which is also known as \"dual-use\" research, involves experimenting with viruses and other pathogens that have the potential to trigger a pandemic. Those studies could discover how infectious agents might become more transmissible or make people sicker. This field has long been controversial because of fears that scientists could make a more dangerous pathogen in their lab that could get out and cause a pandemic. Those concerns have led tomany efforts over the years to more tightly monitor and control this research. But gain-of-function research became especially controversial and politically polarized during the COVID-19 pandemic. One theory for how the pandemic started says that the SARS-CoV2 virus, which causes COVID-19, spilled out of a Chinese government laboratory in Wuhan, China. \"Many people believe that gain-of-function research was one of the key causes of the COVID pandemic that struck us in the last decade,\" said White House secretary Will Scharf. \"What this executive order does first of all, it provides powerful new tools to enforce the ban on federal funding for gain-of-function research abroad. It also strengthens other oversight mechanisms related to that issue and creates an overarching strategy to ensure that biomedical research in general is being conducted safely.\" Many scientists refute that theory, arguing that the weight of the evidence suggests the pandemic started when someone in China was infected by a wild animal carrying the virus. That said, many scientists also agree that better oversight is needed because of the possible risks. But many worry a moratorium would be too broad and could stifle safe research and that is necessary to prevent or respond to the next pandemic. \"If we ban it, the next time another COVID virus comes through we won't have the data to quickly find new treatments, screening and even preventative measures,\" saysKristin Matthews, a fellow in science and technology policy at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy. But others want funding restricted. \"If one of these pathogens is released accidentally or if they are released deliberately, they can cause pandemics,\" saidRichard Ebright, a microbiologist at Rutgers University who subscribes to the so-called \"lab-leak\" theory to explain how the pandemic originated. According to the White House, the executive order would block any U.S. funding of gain-of-function research in \"countries of concern,\" such as China and Iran, as well as other foreign nations \"deemed to have insufficient research oversight.\" The order also prohibits U.S. dollars from \"contributing to foreign research likely to cause another pandemic.\" The order also \"empowers American research agencies to identify and end federal funding of other biological research that could pose a threat to American public health, public safety, or national security,\" according to a White House fact sheet. The order will \"increase the safety and security of biological research without impeding U.S. innovation,\" the White House says. The White House also issued statements from several Trump administration officials who argued the funding restriction is necessary. \"I commend President Trump for his courage and his vision,\" said Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \"This is a historic day,\" said Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, the director of the National Institutes of Health. \"The conduct of this research does not protect us against pandemics, as some people might say, it doesn't protect us against other nations. There's always a danger that in doing this research, it might leak out, just by accident even, and cause a pandemic.\" \"It's crazy to think that this entire nightmare was probably the result of some scientists messing with mother nature in a laboratory with technology,\" said Dr. Marty Makary, the Food and Drug Administration commissioner.

    "title": "States sue Trump administration for blocking the development of wind energy",
    "article_text": "By The Associated Press Wind turbines of South Fork Wind are seen off the coast of Block Island, R.I., on Oct. 9, 2024.Seth Wenig/APhide caption A coalition of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump's attempt to stop the development of wind energy. Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging an executive order Trump signed during his first day in office, pausing approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore. They say Trump doesn't have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and he's jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states' economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals. They're asking a federal judge to declare the order unlawful and stop federal agencies from implementing it. \"This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition, said in a statement. White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Democratic attorneys general are \"using lawfare to stop the president's popular energy agenda,\" instead of working with him to unleash American energy and lower prices for families. \"The American people voted for the president to restore America's energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats' radical climate agenda,\" Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press. Trump vowed during the campaign to end the offshore wind industry if he returned to the White House. His order said there were \"alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government's leasing and permitting\" of wind projects, and it directed the Interior secretary to review wind leasing and permitting practices for federal waters and lands. The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Massachusetts. The Biden administration saw offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale projects. Trump is reversing those energy policies. He's boosting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, arguing it's necessary for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity in the world. The Trump administration took a more aggressive step against wind in April when it ordered the Norwegian company Equinor to halt construction on Empire Wind, a fully permitted project located southeast of Long Island, New York, that is about 30% complete. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval. Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year to provide power to 500,000 New York homes. Equinor is considering legal options, which would be separate from the complaint filed Monday. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor. Wind provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the United States, making it the nation's largest source of renewable energy. The attorneys general argue that Trump's order is at odds with years of bipartisan support for wind energy and contradicts his own declaration of a \"national energy emergency,\" which called for expanding domestic energy production. The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Washington, D.C. They say they've invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the executive order sows chaos, when businesses need clear regulations to effectively operate. Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of state plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in populous East Coast states with limited land. The nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm opened a year ago, a 12-turbine wind farm east of Montauk Point, New York. A smaller wind farm operates near Block Island in waters controlled by the state of Rhode Island. Massachusetts has invested in offshore wind to ensure residents have access to well-paying green jobs and reliable, affordable energy, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said. The state has three offshore wind projects in various stages of development, include Vineyard Wind. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday denied to hear a case brought by fishermen's organizations challenging the approval of Vineyard Wind. The Trump administration has also suspended federal funding for floating offshore wind research in Maine and revoked a permit for a proposed offshore wind project in New Jersey. Elsewhere, political leaders are trying to rapidly increase wind energy. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a major investment in wind power in April while hosting an international summit on energy security. Nova Scotia plans to offer leases for five gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston said in Virginia last week at an Oceantic Network conference.

    "title": "Be square and get to the root of it! Celebrate Square Root Day today!",
    "article_text": "Ari Daniel Linda Gordon draws cartoons forthe websitethat her husband Ron Gordon made to celebrate mathematically themed days.Linda Gordonhide caption Today is Cinco de Mayo.  And this year, the fifth of May is filled with mathematical joy. It is — Square Root Day! It all started in 1981. \"I was writing a check in late August,\" says Ron Gordon, who originated bringing the day to fame. He said to himself, \"Wait a minute, in the next couple weeks, it's going to be 9-9-81.\" That is, September 9th, 1981. The number of the month (9) multiplied by the day (9) equaled the year — 81. In other words, the square root of 81 is 9. So Gordon called the day Square Root Day. He drummed up a fair amount of press for it. \"I probably rolled my eyes and thought, 'Oh, here we go!,' \" chuckles Linda Gordon, Ron's wife. She draws cartoons forthe websitethat Ron put together where he has a handful of other mathematically themed days he's come up with. \"When it was 11-11-11 with all the ones,\" recalls Ron, \"we called it \"Ones Upon a Day.\" Then, on February 2, 2022, he says, they called it \"Trumpet Day because it goes 'To-to-to-toooo.' So for me, each of these, it's just a little math, a little smile, and a little fun.\" Ron's daughter, years ago in elementary school, wasn't so sure, however. He says, she said, \" 'Dad, if these are really holidays, how come we have to go to school?' \" Out of all his math-themed calendar joy, he says Square Root Day comes along nine times each century, and each one is worth celebrating. And the Gordons do celebrate! \"We will have square steak with root vegetables cut up in cubes,\" says Linda. She says that Ron will drink root beer and that she'll only sip it. \"It's not my favorite, but don't tell anybody.\" \"It's a good day to get things squared away, to try to fit a square peg into a round hole, go square dancing, root for the underdog, or watch the pigs root around,\" says Ron. Today is extra special because the year also happens to be a perfect square. That is, 45 times 45 is 2025. Square Root Day is a reminder that math is all around us, saysTerrence Blackman, chair of the mathematics department at Medgar Evers College in the City University of New York. \"It allows us to, in a way, wonder about the world in which we live and the patterns that inform our lives,\" he explains. In fact, he says, square roots go beyond interesting math, they matter quite a lot in cybersecurity. \"[The] square root is a very powerful thing,\" says Blackman. \"It helps with encryption, decryption, absolutely. It makes a number of the things that we do in our electronic world work and work efficiently.\" Back in 1981, when Ron launched Square Root Day, Ron was a high school science and social studies teacher in Redwood City, California.

    "title": "Former Palantir workers condemn company's work with Trump administration",
    "article_text": "Bobby Allyn The logo of the big data analytics software company Palantir Technologies on display during the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos, on Jan. 23, 2025.Fabrice Coffrini/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption Thirteen former employees of influential data-mining firm Palantir are condemning the company's work with the Trump administration weeks after Immigration and Customs Enforcementreached a dealto pay Palantir $30 million to provide the agency with \"near real-time visibility\" into the movement of migrants in the U.S. Ina lettershared exclusively with NPR, the ex-Palantir workers, former software engineers, managers and an employee who worked in the firm's privacy and civil liberties team, say when they joined the powerful tech company, they believed in itscode of conductstating that its software should uphold democracy and ensure the responsible development of artificial intelligence. \"Early Palantirians understood the ethical weight of building these technologies,\" the thirteen former employees wrote inthe letter. \"These principles have now been violated, and are rapidly being dismantled at Palantir Technologies and across Silicon Valley.\" Palantir and the White House did not return requests for comment. Palantir, co-founded by Trump ally billionaire Peter Thiel, offers data-analyzing software that uses AI to pull information from a multitude of sources and compiles it into charts, tables and heat maps. Its products have become popular with large corporations, the military and law enforcement. Their customers include the Israel Defense Forces and the U.S. Department of Defense. Now, its surveillance tools are being tapped by the Trump administration to help speed up the president's goal ofdeporting 1 million migrantsthis year. Since Trump was elected, Palantir's share price has surgedmore than 200%. Although about a dozen former workers are just a fraction of a company employing 4,000, the letter is still significant. Much of Palantir's work is secretive and few former workers criticize the company after leaving due to non-disparagement agreements most are asked to sign upon leaving. Many former employees also hold company stock. Palantir's market valuation stands at nearly $300 billion – about the same as Bank of America. Alex Karp, Palantir's CEO, speaks on a panel at the U.S. Capitol on April 30, 2025 in Washington, DC.Kevin Dietsch/Getty Imageshide caption While top brass at Silicon Valley's largest companies have been showing support for the Trump administration,studies have foundthatrank-and-file tech workerstend to oppose Trump and hold liberal views on a host of social issues. Big Tech employees resisted the first Trump administration's policies, including theattempts to restrictimmigration and travel from foreign countries, yet the former Palantir employees say the resistance has been muted among tech workers in Trump's second term. They wrote: \"democracy faces escalating threats: biometric data collection on immigrant children, journalists being targeted, science programs defunded, and key U.S. allies, like Ukraine, sidelined. Trump's administration has sought to greatly expand executive powers while alluding to monarchy,\" adding that: \"Big Tech, including Palantir, is increasingly complicit, normalizing authoritarianism under the guise of a 'revolution' led by oligarchs. We must resist this trend.\" The signees highlight what they say is Palantir's \"increasingly violent rhetoric,\" a nod to Palantir chief executive Alex Karp, who publicly boasts about how the company's tools are used to kill enemies. Heonce jokingly saidthat Wall Street analysts who \"tried to screw\" the company should be sprayed with \"light fentanyl-laced urine.\" The letter also zeros in on Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency team, which has hired a number of former Palantir employees to assist in slashing and burning the federal government. The tech workers admonish the White House for its moves with DOGE and beyond to undo diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, arguing that those principles \"remain essential for critiquing power\" and ensuring advanced AI is deployed ethically. \"As Musk's DOGE operation dismantles U.S. government institutions under the guise of exposing corruption, opposition remains silent,\" the workers write. \"Government databases are already erasing references to transgender people and gender-affirming care. These injustices could be facilitated by the very software infrastructure we help build.\" The former Palantir workers write that they are issuing a warning in hopes of triggering a \"domino effect\" in Silicon Valley. They say that more tech workers should resist what they see as the misuse of AI and other tools in the Trump administration's policies, including its immigration enforcement and deportation policies that courts and critics say have at times ignored due process rights. Their aim, they write is \"to speak out while we still can, and to work against the dangerous path in the history of technology we are currently heading down towards.\" Have information you want to share about Palantir?

    "title": "Trump's plan for movie tariffs leads to global confusion",
    "article_text": "Mandalit del Barco The Hollywood sign in January 2024. Production in Hollywood has been declining.Mario Tama/Getty Images North Americahide caption The film and TV industry around the world is reeling from President Trump's announcement that he plans to impose a 100% tariff on movies produced outside the U.S. On his social media platform Truth Social on Sunday, Trump declared that America's movie industry is \"dying a very fast death,\" arguing that Hollywood is being \"devastated\" by other nations that draw filmmakers and studios away from the U.S. with incentives. Many American films and TV shows are shot entirely or at least partially outside the U.S. The upcoming movie,Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning,wasshot on a Norwegian archipelago, among many other locales. Countries like Canada, the UK and Australia have long offered productions generous tax incentives, rebates, grants and new sound stages to work in. Trump gave no details about how the movie tariffs would work and who would pay them. On Monday, he added that he plans to meet with members of the film industry. \"I want to make sure they're happy with it, because we're all about jobs,\" the president said, saying that he didn't want to hurt the industry. \"Hollywood doesn't do very much of that business. They have the nice sign and everything's good, but they don't do very much.\" \"We have so many questions,\" said Steven Jaworski, vice president of production with A&E Studios, which is headquartered in Los Angeles. \"Production in the United States, and specifically California, is at a massive decline,\" he shared. But, he said, it's too soon to have any clear sense of what a 100% tariff might mean for the industry – or how it would even work. The Motion Picture Association, which represents Hollywood's major film and TV studios, has not responded to NPR's request for comment about the president's plan. On Monday, SAG-AFTRA National Executive Director and Chief Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland said the union — which represents film and television actors and performers, along with media workers more broadly — looks forward to learning more. \"SAG-AFTRA supports efforts to increase movie, television and streaming production in the United States. We will continue to advocate for policies that strengthen our competitive position, accelerate economic growth and create good middle class jobs for American workers,\" Crabtree-Ireland said. For nearly four months in 2023, actors in the union went on strike, bringing production in Hollywood to a standstill at the same time writers were striking, too. (Note: Some NPR News staffers are also members of SAG-AFTRA, but were not on strike, as they are under a different contract.) The union IATSE, which represents behind-the-scenes craftspeople and technicians in the entertainment industry in the U.S. and Canada, shared their own statement emphasizing the \"urgent threat from international competition.\" \"We await further information on the administration's proposed tariff plan, but we continue to stand firm in our conviction that any eventual trade policy must do no harm to our Canadian members — nor the industry overall,\" said the union's International President Matthew D. Loeb. The CEO ofScreen Producers Australiawrote that the news will send shockwaves worldwide. The head of BECTU, the UK's media and entertainment industry workers' union, says the tariffs would deal a \"knock out blow\" to the country's film and TV production industry. President Trump told reporters outside Air Force One on Sunday that he also blames California Governor Gavin Newsom for allowing productions to leave the state. But Newsom's office said in a statement to NPR that the governor has been working to more than double the amount of tax incentives his state offers productions to shoot and film there. A spokesperson said the governor will review a more detailed tariff proposal if the president has one. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

Cooke/NASAhide caption Time to roll out your picnic blanket and unfold those lawn chairs: A meteor shower is set to streak across the (very) early morning sky on May 6. The annual Eta Aquarid meteor shower is expected to peak early Tuesday morning with meteors flying into Earth's atmosphere at speeds of 40.7 miles per second,according to NASA. Eta Aquarids come from the leftover comet particles, pieces of broken asteroids and other space debris that originate from the famous Halley's Comet, which takes about 76 years to orbit the sun once. With the right preparation and an early alarm clock, there will be plenty of opportunities to spot around 50 meteors per hour at the peak of this shower, according to the U.S. space agency. The moon will set by roughly 3 a.m. on May 6, NASA said, leaving the dark skies at their most ideal condition for meteor spotting until dawn. If you live in the Northern Hemisphere, you canexpect to seeabout 10 to 20 meteors per hour. Those living south of the equator will see a far more active sky, thanks to the different viewing location of the Eta Aquarids' radiant — the point in the sky from which meteors appear to originate. For Eta Aquarids, that radiant is the Aquarius constellation, which is higher up in the sky in the Southern Hemisphere than it is in the Northern Hemisphere.

    "title": "Minor infractions lead to big problems for international students",
    "article_text": "Joel Rose Thousands of international students studying at U.S. universities have had their visa records terminated by the Trump administration, sometimes for infractions as minor as a traffic violation.Lisa Poole/APhide caption Thousands of international students found their livesthrown into chaosin recent weeks by a Trump administration effort to flag their past brushes with law enforcement that left them unable to work or study in the U.S. \"This incident has affected my whole life,\" said one man who recently got a master's degree from the University of South Florida. The man, who asked NPR not to use his name because he's afraid of retaliation from immigration authorities, believes his troubles began with a minor traffic violation a few years ago, when he was charged with failing to yield to a police officer. The case was quickly dismissed after he explained to a judge that he had been waiting for a safe place to pull off the highway, he said. But that single dismissed charge has upended his life anyway. He said he was forced to resign from his first job at the Florida Department of Revenue when the student visa registration that allowed him to continue his training and work was terminated by Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ICE. \"They have done irreparable damages already,\" said the man, who has joined a lawsuit with other international students. \"Like some people left the country. Some people left their studies. And in my case, I lost my job.\" Under President Trump's immigration crackdown, any contact with law enforcement— no matter how small— can have big consequences for immigrants. That'sespecially true for international students. After weeks of confusion, the Trump administration was compelled to confirm in court on April 29 that it terminated immigration records for thousands of international students because of past encounters with law enforcement, many of them minor. As the records were terminated, many colleges and universities were unsure how to proceed. They turned to public guidance ona Department of Homeland Security websitetitled \"Study in the States\" that says students whose records are terminated lose their authorization to work, and either \"apply for reinstatement\" or \"must leave the United States immediately.\" \"So for getting a speeding ticket, they all of a sudden lost their visa status, were told they couldn't go to class and that they had to leave the country immediately,\" said Brad Banias, an immigration lawyer who's representing more than 100 students in lawsuits against the Trump administration. At least 60 of these lawsuits were filed across the country by international students, some just weeks from graduation. All of these cases hinge on a little-known government database that is crucial to the lives of international students. It's called the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, or SEVIS. It was created after the 9/11 attacksto track international students, to make sure they're going to class and complying with other federal visa requirements. ICE abruptly terminated those crucial records for thousands of students with littlenotice or explanation, said Charles Kuck, an immigration lawyer who also represents over 100 students in lawsuits against the Trump administration. \"It's quite clear that what ICE did here broke the law,\" Kuck said. \"They didn't follow the regulations they themselves have published and the policy that themselves have published.\" On April 25, the Justice Department said ICE would reverse course and restore or planned to restore the records, at least for now. But by then, judges had already ruled against the administration in dozens of cases. \"They got tired of losing,\" said Kuck. During a federal court hearing last week the Trump administration finally confirmed what immigration lawyers had suspected. Starting in March, officials at ICE ran the names of more than 1 million international students through the National Crime Information Center, a federal database that tracks crime-related information. ICE came up with about 6,400 likely hits and then used that data to terminate thousands of SEVIS records. That's according to court testimony from Andre Watson, an official with ICE's Counter Threat Lead Development Unit. The problem, immigration lawyers say, is that many of those hits were for minor brushes with the law— including traffic offenses, or cases where charges were later dropped or dismissed by police and courts. It was one of Banias's clients— Akshar Patel, a student at the University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee— whose case was heard in federal district court in Washington, D.C. last week. The Department of Justice argued in court that terminating a student's SEVIS record alone did not take away their legal status in the U.S., although that appeared to contradict the public guidance on DHS' \"Study in the States\" website. Judge Ana Reyes pushed ICE to explain what the termination of SEVIS records means and why it occurred. And she summoned Watson, the ICE official, to court last week to describe how this effort known informally inside the agency as the \"Student Criminal Alien Initiative\" worked. The termination of SEVIS records was intended as a \"red flag,\" Watson said, so that schools and universities could then \"determine if the student is still in compliance\" with the terms of their visa. But Reyes noted that ICE could have achieved that goal by simply communicating with the universities. And she seemed troubled by what she described as \"zero due process\" for students whose records were terminated. \"Each record was scrutinized based on the criminal history,\" Watson said, according to a court transcript. But Reyes was skeptical. She noted that Patel, the plaintiff in the case, had faced reckless driving charges that were ultimately dismissed. \"You and I both know Mr. Patel is not a criminal, right? And anyone looking at the record would know that he's not a criminal,\" Reyes said. \"All of this could have been avoided if individuals had taken a beat, instead of just rushing things,\" she said. \"But that's not happening.\" Immigrant advocates worry the Trump administration will try more efforts like this as it gathers more data about immigrants with and without legal status. \"ICE is completely comfortable painting anyone who has any interaction with the police as someone with a criminal record,\" Banias said. \"That's the terrifying part.\" ICE did not reply to NPR's request for comment. A spokesperson for the State Department, which adjudicates student visas, did not respond to questions about the terminations. But Secretary of State Marco Rubio has defended the administration's aggressive push to revoke student visas and green cards from pro-Palestinian campus protesters and other international students. \"If you're here on a student visa and you have a DUI or you have some other crime, that's an automatic suspension,\" Rubio said in an interview last month with the president's son Donald Trump Jr. on his podcast,Triggered. \"That should be automatic. You commit a crime while you're in this country, your visa's gone. You didn't tell us you were coming here to break the law. You told us you were coming here to study,\" Rubio said. A conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs can be grounds to revoke a student visa. But many of the law enforcement encounters that ICE used to justify these SEVIS terminations were far less serious. When a Justice Department lawyer announced the students' records would be restored, he also said the government would adopt a new formal policy for revoking records in the database going forward. This new policy could make it far easier to strip students of their legal status. An internal memo from the ICE office that handles SEVIS records, included in court filings last week, stated that ICE can terminate those records immediately after a student's visa is revoked. That would be a sharp change from past practice. Until now, revoking a student's visa did not automatically terminate the SEVIS records. Even if their visa was revoked, they could still stay in the U.S. to finish school, although they would not be able to reenter if they left the country. Some students are still wondering why they were flagged at all. \"I have not had any interaction with law enforcement in the seven plus years I've been in the U.S.,\" said a post-doctoral student at Purdue University in Indiana, who spoke to NPR on the condition of anonymity because he is also worried about retaliation. The student had been applying for faculty positions in this country. But now, he's trying to line up a job in Europe. And he says he knows many other international students who are also looking to leave the U.S. \"It's not obvious to me for what reason I could have been targeted,\" he said. \"And that's sort of the scariest part because, like, you don't know what you did.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

Microsoft, which owns Skype,announced in Februarythat the service would be available until May 5 and urged users to switch over to the free version of Microsoft Teams, its communication platform that features the ability to video call. \"Skype has been an integral part of shaping modern communications and supporting countless meaningful moments, and we are honored to have been part of the journey,\" Jeff Teper, Microsoft's president of collaborative apps and platforms,said in a blog postearlier this year. Skype, founded in 2003 by Niklas Zennström and Janus Friis,began as a serviceoffering phone calls over the internet. Later, it also let users video call each other and send private messages — all for free. It was among the first video conferencing apps and exploded in popularity, at one point boasting more than 300 million users,according to theWashington Post. In 2005, eBay purchased Skype for $2.6 billion. eBay then sold its controlling interest to a group of investors in 2009, who in turn sold the video calling service to Microsoft. But Skype's user base has dwindled in recent years, as the app has faced growing competition from video calling and messaging alternatives such as Zoom, WhatsApp and Slack.

    "title": "Heartbreaking video shows deadly risk of skipping measles vaccine",
    "article_text": "SSPE is rare but tragic—more so because it's completely vaccine-preventable. In a hard-to-watch video, a healthy-looking 4-year-old boy lies on a bed as doctors lift his eyelids to watch his big brown eyes erratically swirl and roll backward. His head jerks, and his little limbs weakly twitch and spasm. A small bit of foam pushes past his lips. The video, captured by neurologists in India andpublished today in JAMA Neurology, shows what it looks like when the measles virus is allowed to ravage a child's brain. (The video can be viewedhere.) The boy was never vaccinated and developed a rare complication from measles called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). The condition occurs when the measles virus quietly sneaks into the central nervous system. It often lurks for years after an initial infection before it begins wreaking havoc, triggering damaging inflammation, destroying neurons, and causing brain lesions. SSPE is almost always fatal, and there is no treatment for it. After the video was taken, the boy continued to deteriorate. He will almost certainly die. His doctors captured the video with permission from the boy's father and a critical message: \"Herein, we emphasize the importance of measles vaccination for children, as SSPE is typically fatal and yet also entirely preventable by vaccination.\" The poignant video and message could not come at a more critical time. Measles has resurged globally in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and it's havinga particularly notable revival in the US, where vaccination rates have slipped nationwide.  Many American communities have immunization rates below the threshold needed for herd immunity, and the country is currently seeing the largest outbreak in over a quarter-century. Modeling suggests that measles will once again become endemic. Meanwhile, the country's top health official,Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is an unswerving anti-vaccine advocate with a long history of spreading dangerous misinformation, which may spur vaccination rates to fall further. The video of SSPE is a clear reminder of the devastation that measles can cause, and the risks parents take by not getting their children vaccinated. An uncomplicated measles infection causes intense fevers and a thoroughly miserable rash for several days. Butcomplications are notthatrare. In the US, 20 percent of children with measles will be hospitalized. Ten percent will develop diarrhea and/or an ear infection, which has the potential to cause hearing loss. One in 20 will develop pneumonia, and 1 in 1,000 will develop brain swelling—up to 3 in 1,000 will die of these respiratory and neurologic complications. Even when a child makes it through the acute phase of the infection, the risks aren't over. The measles virus can wipe out the immune system's memory of how to fight other germs—a phenomenon called \"immune amnesia.\" This leaves children vulnerable to secondary infections for approximately two to three years after an infection. Then, there's SSPE. The neurologic condition is considered rare and is poorly understood. Researchers estimate that there are up to 11 SSPE cases per 100,000 measles cases. However, the risk of SSPE is higher for children who get infected before the age of 5, in which case it's 18 per 100,000 measles cases. SSPE doesn't develop immediately, it can take months to many years after an acute infection—the average is between seven to ten years post-infection. Experts don't entirely understand how it happens.Some evidence suggeststhat abnormal immune responses or mutations that the virus may acquire once inside neurons may play a role. What is clear is that the risk from measles far outweighs any risk posed by vaccination. Once SSPE develops, it moves throughprogressive stages, starting with mood swings, personality changes, depression, lethargy, and possibly fever and headache. This first stage can last up to six months. Then stage two involves jerking movement, spasms, loss of vision, dementia, and seizures. The third stage sees the jerking turn to writhing and rigidity. In the last stage, autonomic failure sets in—heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing become unregulated. Then comes coma and death. About 95 percent of SSPE cases are fatal. In the boy's case, his parents don't know when he was infected with measles. When doctors saw him, his parents recalled that in the prior six months, he had started having jerky movements, falls, and progressive cognitive decline. Before that, he had been healthy at birth and had been hitting all of his developmental milestones. In some ways, his decline was an unmistakable case of SSPE. Imaging showed lesions in his brain. He had elevated anti-measles antibodies in his cerebrospinal fluid. An electroencephalography (EEG) showed brain waves consistent with SSPE. Then, of course, there were the jerking motions and the cognitive decline. What stood out, though, was his rolling and swirling eyes. Vision problems are not uncommon with SSPE—sometimes the condition damages the retina and/or optic nerve. Some patients develop complete vision loss. But, in the boy's case, he developed rapid, repetitive, erratic, multidirectional eye movements, a condition called opsoclonus. Doctors often see it in brain cancer patients, but brain inflammation from some infections can also cause the movements. Experts hypothesize that the root cause is a loss of specialized neurons involved in coordinated movement, namely Purkinje cells and omnipause cells. The boy's neurologists believe this is the first time opsoclonus associated with SSPE has been caught on video. They treated the boy with an antiviral drug and drugs to reduce convulsions, but his condition continued to worsen.

    "article_text": "Mike Waltz needs to find a new app. A messaging service used by former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz has temporarily shut down while the company investigates an apparent hack. The messaging app is used to access and archive Signal messages, but is not made by Signal itself. 404 Mediareportedyesterday that a hacker stole data \"from TeleMessage, an obscure Israeli company that sells modified versions of Signal and other messaging apps to the US government to archive messages.\" 404 Media interviewed the hacker and reported that the data stolen \"contains the contents of some direct messages and group chats sent using [TeleMessage's] Signal clone, as well as modified versions of WhatsApp, Telegram, and WeChat.\" TeleMessage is based in Israel and wasacquired in February 2024by Smarsh, a company headquartered in Portland, Oregon. Smarsh provided a statement to Ars today saying it has temporarily shut down all TeleMessage services. \"TeleMessage is investigating a recent security incident,\" the statement said. \"Upon detection, we acted quickly to contain it and engaged an external cybersecurity firm to support our investigation. Out of an abundance of caution, all TeleMessage services have been temporarily suspended. All other Smarsh products and services remain fully operational.\" Last week,Waltz was photographedusing the TeleMessage Signal app on his phone during a White House cabinet meeting. Waltz'sability to secure sensitive government communicationshas been in question since he inadvertentlyinvited The Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldbergto a Signal chat in which top Trump administration officials discussed a plan for bombing Houthi targets in Yemen. Waltz was removed from his post late last week, with Trumpnominatinghim to serve as ambassador to the United Nations. The TeleMessage website until recently boasted the ability to \"capture, archive and monitor mobile communication\" through text messages, voice calls, WhatsApp, WeChat, Telegram, and Signal, as seen in anInternet Archive capturefrom Saturday. Anotherarchived pagesays that TeleMessage \"captures and records Signal calls, messages, deletions, including text, multimedia, [and] files,\" and \"maintain[s] all Signal app features and functionality as well as the Signal encryption.\" The TeleMessage home pagecurrentlymakes no mention of Signal, and links on the page have been disabled. The anonymous hacker who reportedly infiltrated TeleMessage told 404 Media that it took about 15 to 20 minutes and \"wasn't much effort at all.\" While the hacker did not obtain Waltz's messages, \"the hack shows that the archived chat logs are not end-to-end encrypted between the modified version of the messaging app and the ultimate archive destination controlled by the TeleMessage customer,\" according to 404 Media. \"Data related to Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the cryptocurrency giant Coinbase, and other financial institutions are included in the hacked material, according to screenshots of messages and backend systems obtained by 404 Media,\" the report said. 404 Media added that the \"hacker did not access all messages stored or collected by TeleMessage, but could have likely accessed more data if they decided to, underscoring the extreme risk posed by taking ordinarily secure end-to-end encrypted messaging apps such as Signal and adding an extra archiving feature to them.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "OpenAI scraps controversial plan to become for-profit after mounting pressure",
    "article_text": "The nonprofit board will retain control, but now investor billions hang in the balance. On Monday, ChatGPT-maker OpenAIannouncedit will remain under the control of its founding nonprofit board, scrapping its controversial plan to split off its commercial operations as a for-profit company after mounting pressure from critics. In an official OpenAI blog post announcing the latest restructuring decision, CEO Sam Altman wrote: \"We made the decision for the nonprofit to stay in control after hearing from civic leaders and having discussions with the offices of the Attorneys General of California and Delaware.\" The move represents a significant shift in OpenAI's proposed restructuring. While the most recent previous version of the company's plan (whichwe coveredin December) would have established OpenAI as a Public Benefit Corporation with the nonprofit merely holding shares and having limited influence, the revised approach keeps the nonprofit firmly in control of operations. Former employees and Elon Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI who later split with its leaders, had criticized the restructuring plan, saying it would remove important oversight of its technology. Muskfiled a lawsuitseeking to block the plan, which is still ongoing. A judge recently agreed that Musk adequately pled that OpenAI breached an implied contract and then \"unjustly retained the benefit\" of his early investments in the company. While the ruling largely sustained Musk’s core complaint, OpenAI did get some claims dropped, including a claim that Musk was misled by public OpenAI statements thatthe court foundhe helped write. OpenAIoriginally announcedits intention to pivot last September, when Reuters reported that the company was planning to restructure its core business into a for-profit benefit corporation that would no longer be controlled by its nonprofit board. The proposed change, spearheaded by Altman, would have ostensibly made OpenAI more attractive to investors while creating a more conventional corporate structure. Under that plan, Altman would have received equity—reportedly around 7 percent—for the first time, representing a significant departure from his previous stance of not taking equity in line with OpenAI's humanitarian mission. The restructuring would have also allowed OpenAI to remove the cap on returns for investors, potentially making the firm more appealing to venture capitalists, with the nonprofit arm continuing to exist but only as a minority stakeholder rather than maintaining governance control. This plan emerged as the companysoughta funding round that would value it at $150 billion, which later expanded to the $40 billion round at a $300 billion valuation. However, the new change in course follows months of mounting pressure from outside the company. In April, a group of legal scholars, AI researchers, and tech industry watchdogsopenly opposedOpenAI's plans to restructure, sending a letter to the attorneys general of California and Delaware. Former OpenAI employees, Nobel laureates, and law professors alsosent lettersto state officials requesting that they halt the restructuring efforts out of safety concerns about which part of the company would be in control of hypothetical superintelligent future AI products. \"OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, is today a nonprofit that oversees and controls the for-profit, and going forward will remain a nonprofit that oversees and controls the for-profit,\" he added. \"That will not change.\" While abandoning the restructuring that would have ended nonprofit control, OpenAI still plans to make significant changes to its corporate structure. \"The for-profit LLC under the nonprofit will transition to a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) with the same mission,\" Altman explained. \"Instead of our current complex capped-profit structure—which made sense when it looked like there might be one dominant AGI effort but doesn't in a world of many great AGI companies—we are moving to a normal capital structure where everyone has stock. This is not a sale, but a change of structure to something simpler.\" But the plan may cause some uncertainty for OpenAI's financial future. When OpenAIsecureda massive $40 billion funding round in March, it came with strings attached: Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, which committed $30 billion, stipulated that it would reduce its contribution to $20 billion if OpenAI failed to restructure into a fully for-profit entity by the end of 2025. Despite the challenges ahead, Altman expressed confidence in the path forward: \"We believe this sets us up to continue to make rapid, safe progress and to put great AI in the hands of everyone.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Google accidentally reveals Android’s Material 3 Expressive interface ahead of I/O",
    "article_text": "Google published and then deleted details of the new Material 3 Expressive theme. Google's acceleratedAndroid release cyclewill soon deliver a new version of the software, and it might look quite different from what you'd expect. Amid rumors of a major UI overhaul, Google seems to have accidentally published a blog post detailing \"Material 3 Expressive,\" which we expect to see revealed at I/O later this month. Google quickly removed the post from its design site, but not before the Internet Archivesaved it. It has been a few years since Google introduced any major changes to itsMaterial theming, but the design team wasn't just sitting idly this whole time. According to the leaked blog post, Google has spent the past three years working on a more emotionally engaging vision for Android design. While theoriginal Material Designdid an admirable job of leveraging colors and consistent theming, it could make apps look too similar. The answer to that, apparently, is Material 3 Expressive. Google says this is \"the most-researched update to Google’s design system, ever.\" The effort reportedly included 46 separate studies with hundreds of sample designs. The team showed these designs to more than 18,000 study participants to understand how the user experience would work. In these studies, the design team used a variety of metrics, including the following: The result of all this is an interface that appears much more varied than the previous Material Design. The Internet Archive didn't snag most of the blog post's visuals, but9to5Googlesaved them. The images include interesting elements, like a floating toolbar and larger, easier to tap buttons in certain areas where they won't interfere with other UI elements. There are a lot of attention-grabbing shapes and bold colors throughout the interface, but there's a reason it's like that. The experimental approach led to theming that reduces the time it takes people to notice and interact with important UI elements by as much as four times. On the flip side, not everyone uses apps the same way—if you are interested in different UI elements than Google, this could be frustrating. All those studies allegedly revealed that people prefer Material 3 Expressive to the old version. However, that preference varies greatly with age. Zoomers apparently like Material 3 Expressive a lot, with over 80 percent of younger folks saying it was better than the non-expressive design. That drops to 52 percent by the time you get to the 55-plus age group. Yeah, change can be scary. Google also says Material 3 Expressive was rated as subjectively \"cooler\" than old designs. This leak confirms Android will get a stylish overhaul in version 16, but the benefits (and drawbacks) won't be shared equally. Android is open source, and other OEMs have their own priorities. They can choose to adopt elements of expressive design or not. Just because Google decrees it does not mean it is so. Depending on the phone you have, the update to Android 16 might not look all that visually different from Android 15. Google creates the open source code and closed-source Google bits, but licensees like Samsung and OnePlus take that and run with it to produce custom versions of the OS with their own branding. It's common to hear Samsung and OnePlus talk about One UI and Oxygen OS, respectively, but not so much about Android itself. Material 3 Expressive may bleed into these modified versions of Android, but you'll need a Google Pixel device for the full effect. Google's Pixel devices will have system elements attached to this theming system, and most of Google's apps will be updated to the new system at some point. If you've got another phone, you'll probably see much less of the expressive style. However, Motorola's Hello UI usually sticks pretty close to Google's material theming. Material 3 Expressive isn't just about the system UI or preloaded apps. Google will also make these design templates available to app developers who can support the bright, energetic theming for all phones. However, uptake of material design in apps has been modest so far. It's common to see apps that use a few material UI elements or color theming, but almost no one is running the full Google style. Google struggled for years to unify Android design aesthetics, but it never made much progress. While Material 3 Expressive looks very thoughtfully designed, it's unlikely it will see any more take-up than the company's previous attempts. Google'scontracts with OEMsand itsmanagement of the Play Storehave both come under legal scrutiny, so the company won't be able to use any heavy-handed tactics to encourage the adoption of Material 3 Expressive.

    "title": "Hundreds of e-commerce sites hacked in supply-chain attack",
    "article_text": "Attack that started in April and remains ongoing runs malicious code on visitors' devices. Hundreds of e-commerce sites, at least one owned by a large multinational company, were backdoored by malware that executes malicious code inside the browsers of visitors, where it can steal payment card information and other sensitive data, security researchers said Monday. The infections are the result of a supply-chain attack that compromised at least three software providers with malware that remained dormant for six years and became active only in the last few weeks. At least 500 e-commerce sites that rely on the backdoored software were infected, and it’s possible that the true number is double that, researchers from security firm Sansecsaid. Among the compromised customers was a $40 billion multinational company, which Sansec didn’t name. In an email Monday, a Sansec representative said that “global remediation [on the infected customers] remains limited.” The supply chain attack poses a significant risk to the thousands or millions of people visiting the infected sites, because it allows attackers to execute code of their choice on ecommerce site servers. From there, the servers run info-stealing code on visitor machines. “Since the backdoor allows uploading and executing arbitrary PHP code, the attackers have full remote code execution (RCE) and can do essentially anything they want,” the representative wrote. “In nearly all Adobe Commerce/Magento breaches we observe, the backdoor is then used to inject skimming software that runs in the user's browser and steals payment information (Magecart).” The three software suppliers identified by Sansec were Tigren, Magesolution (MGS), and Meetanshi. All three supply software that’s based onMagento, an open source e-commerce platform used by thousands of online stores. A software version sold by a fourth provider named Weltpixel has been infected with similar code on some of its customers' stores, but Sansec so far has been unable to confirm whether it was the stores or Weltpixel that were hacked. Adobe has owned Megento since 2018. The Sansec representative said that as of Monday, both Tigren and Magesolution continued to distribute backdoored versions of their software to customers. Meetanshi, the representative added, has denied “any tampering but admits to being hacked.” Tigren, Magesolution, and Meetanshi didn’t respond to questions sent by email and contact forms on their sites. Attempts to reach Weltpixel were unsuccessful. Sansec said that any e-commerce site that relies on software from one of the vendors should carefully inspect their platforms for signs of infection. One of the easiest ways to spot the malicious code is looking for a function added to it that executes a file named $licenseFile as PHP code. The backdoor code checks for a secret key in incoming Web requests and when presented gives the key holder the ability to run commands on the e-commerce server. Once $licenseFile runs, it initiates a chain of additional functions that eventually execute malicious PHP code on the machines of site visitors. Sansec’s post, linked above, provides additional details admins can use to determine if they’re infected. In all, Sansec identified 21 extensions from the three providers that have been infected. They are: One of the biggest mysteries surrounding Sansec’s discovery is how the malware that kicked off the supply-chain attack managed to remain dormant and undetected for six years before coming to life. These sorts of delayed backdoors are a rarity. Sansec said it’s still investigating. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Only elites used hallucinogens in ancient Andes society",
    "article_text": "Snuff tubes and spoons unearthed at Chavín de Huántar in Peru had traces of vilca and nicotine. In 2022, we told you about a studyreportingevidence that an ancient Peruvian people called the Wari laced the beer served at their feasts with hallucinogens—particularly a substance derived from the seeds of the vilca tree, which was common in the region during the Middle Horizon period (circa 850 CE) when the Wari empire thrived. This may have helped theWariforge political alliances and expand their empire. Now archaeologists have discovered direct evidence that the use of vilca was a common practice some 1,000 years earlier than the Wari, thanks to analysis of artifacts unearthed at Chavín de Huántar, located about 250 kilometers north of Lima, Peru. And the Chavín people may have used it for a different purpose: to reinforce social hierarchies by limiting consumption of those substances to an elite few, according to a new paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. There is ample evidence that humans in many cultures throughout history used various hallucinogenic substances in religious ceremonies or shamanic rituals. That includesancient Egypt, as well as ancient Greek, Vedic,Maya, Inca, and Aztec cultures. TheUrarinapeople who live in the Peruvian Amazon Basin still use a psychoactive brew calledayahuascain their rituals, and Westerners seeking their own brand of enlightenment have been known to participate. TheWari empirelasted from around 500 CE to 1100 CE in the central highlands of Peru. Vilcatypically grows in the dry tropical forests in the region. The trees produce long legumes filled with thin seeds. The seeds, bark, and other parts of the tree all containDMT, a well-known psychedelic substance that is also found in theayahuasca brewsof Amazonian tribes. However, the primary active ingredient isbufotenine, the effects of which quickly wear off if the drug is taken orally. So it's usually smoked, ingested in the form of snuff, or used as an enema by those seeking the full hallucinogenic effect. A 4,000-year-old pipe laced with bufotenine residue and related paraphernalia was found in an Incan cave in Argentina in 1999—the oldest archaeological evidence to date for using vilca in South America. There is also evidence from historical accounts that a juice or tea derived from vilca seeds was sometimes added tochicha, a fermented beverage made from maize or the fruits of the molle tree native to Peru. This is one way to take vilca orally while still getting a weaker, sustained psychedelic effect, since the beta-carbolines produced during the fermentation of chicha suppress the stomach enzymes that counteract the high by deactivating the active compounds. People of the neighboring state of Tiwanaku were known to mix such hallucinogens with alcohol, specifically maize beer. There are depictions of vilca seed pods on Wari jars that are about the right size for serving chicha. Excavations at a remote Wari outpost called Quilcapampa unearthed seeds from the vilca tree. Since no snuff paraphernalia was recovered from the site, it's most likely that the vilca was added to the chicha. Chavín de Huántar was once the heart of the Chavín culture, a civilization that flourished in the central Andes centuries before the rise of the Inca Empire. Its oldest granite and limestone temples date back to about 1200 BCE, but people have lived at the site for much longer, since at least 3000 BCE. The center features an array of stone-faced structures built around open plazas with interior species that archaeologists call galleries. In 2022, archaeologistsrediscovereda narrow duct leading to a small ritual chamber 8 meters deep beneath one of the site’s temple buildings. They dubbed it the Condor Gallery. That expedition was led by Stanford University archaeologist John Rick, a co-author on this latest paper, which concerns the excavation of a sealed gallery located in the atrium of the site's Circular Plaza. Among the artifacts recovered were 23 items associated with using psychoactive plants: short snuff tubes, flat tablets, and small spoons, all made of animal bone except for one made of a marine mollusk shell. The chemical analysis of the artifacts revealed that six showed traces of both vilca and nicotine derived from wild relatives of tobacco (Nicotiana), per the authors, with the latter confirmed by microbotanical analysis. Furthermore, there was some damage to starch grains recovered from inside the snuff tubes, suggesting exposure to dry heat—most likely the drying and toasting of vilca seeds andNicotianaroots. \"Drying and toasting is consistent with ethnographic accounts of the preparation of snuff in general and of vilca and tobacco in particular,\" the authors wrote. \"The latter preparation also includes grinding, which could also be a cause of some of the observed damage.\" Such psychoactive compounds may have been used in certain immersive rituals. \"One of the few practices clearly represented in Chavín art is the procession,\" co-author Daniel Contreras, an anthropological archaeologist at the University of Florida, told Ars. \"These involve apparently costumed individuals, in some cases carrying shell trumpets. Some examples of the trumpets themselves have actually been excavated from another underground gallery very near the one that we write about here, lending credence to the idea that what's depicted in the art is some part of actual ceremonial practice.\" Unlike the Wari, who used psychedelics in communal settings to strengthen social bonds, the Chavín people were more exclusive about who got to partake, based on the fact that the snuff tubes were found in private chambers with limited capacity. This would serve to strengthen social hierarchies and reinforce the authority of the select few. \"The Wari examples are about 1,000 years later, as are the Tiwanaku ones, so maybe it's not surprising that there should be some variation in how people were using vilca,\" Contreras told Ars. \"We don't know that this is theonlycontext in which vilca was used at Chavín—just that it's clear it was being used in this particular restricted-access context. That's not to say that it or other substances—including such simple things as food and chicha—weren't also being used in more open contexts to build social bonds. Work parties for harvest or canal cleaning, for example, are still very much part of life in the rural Central Andes, and for that matter anywhere else (including the U.S.).\" \"If I had to guess, I'd say those were very much part of Chavín as well,\" he added. \"But that at the same time some kinds of rituals were very particular and likely exclusive with respect to location, content, and maybe substances involvement—both procuring plants and knowing how to prepare them may have required pretty specialized knowledge.\" The discovery has broader implications because Chavín straddled a major social transition. Between 500 and 1,000 years after Chavín, \"there were already sedentary villages practicing agriculture and engaged in communal building projects recognizably similar to Chavín—platform mounds arrayed around plazas,\" said Contreras. \"However, there's little evidence of the existence of substantial and durable inequality, and much less evidence of craft specialization, production, and long-distance trade/exchange than there is at Chavín.\" But in the 1,000 years after  Chavín, \"settlements got significantly bigger and more urban, and several Andean societies can be found (Moche, for instance) that were very clearly strongly hierarchical; social, political, and economic inequality had become the norm,\" Contreras said. \"Chavín is obviously not the only archaeological site found between those two extremes, but it's a really interesting place to examine that transition.\" PNAS, 2025.

    "article_text": "Microsoft bought Skype for $8.5 billion in 2011, and now its journey is over. Today is the day: Microsoft has formally shuttered the Skype app and service after announcing in February that Skype was being axed in favor of Microsoft Teams, the company's Slack competitor. The Skype apps have all been advertising the end of the service and pointing users to Teams for weeks now. As of today, if you open the app or navigateto the Skype site, you'll be directed to use Teams instead. The last active vestige of Skype is theSkype Dial Pad, which Skype subscribers and members with Skype Credits can still use to make calls to traditional telephone numbers (the Dial Pad is also incorporated intoMicrosoft Teams Free). It's an unceremonious end for an app that was once synonymous with video calls. Microsoft originally bought Skypefor $8.5 billion in 2011; it was also owned by eBay from 2005 to 2009 and by a group of venture capital firms between 2009 and 2011. Ironically, Microsoft bought the app to replace its own first-party communication client at the time, Windows Live Messenger (which itself had grown out of the old MSN Messenger). Though not the first software to allow video communication over the Internet, Skype was one of the first recognizably modern peer-to-peer video chatting apps. Created by some of the same developers behind the Kazaa peer-to-peer file-sharing software, Skype was originally released in 2003, at around the same time when increasing broadband Internet availability and better video compression codecs were solving the bandwidth problem. Butas detailed by Wired, Skype lost momentum after the Microsoft purchase, partly due to a redesign that people didn't like and partly because upstarts like Zoom were offering new features and better call quality. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020 and all kinds of office jobs shifted to remote work, it was Zoom and not Skype that was in a better position to become the video-chatting app everyone was trapped in. Skype has been merging into or being replaced by Teams for years, starting withthe end of Skype for Business in 2017, a few months afterformally releasing the first version of Teams. Microsoft has pushed Teams aggressively, including it alongside its flagship Office apps and Microsoft 365 service for years. Some regulators believed this was, in fact,tooaggressive, andMicrosoft decoupled Teams from the other Office appsin 2023 (for the European Union) and 2024 (for everyone else).

    "title": "Why Google Gemini’s Pokémon success isn’t all it’s cracked up to be",
    "article_text": "Assistance from an external \"agent harness\" was key to the model's success. Earlier this year, we took a look at how and whyAnthropic's Claude large language model was struggling to beatPokémon Red(a game, let's remember, designed for young children). But while Claude 3.7 isstill struggling to make consistent progress at the gameweeks later, a similarTwitch-streamed effort using Google's Gemini 2.5 modelmanaged to finally completePokémon Bluethis weekend across over 106,000 in-game actions, earning accolades from followers,including Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Before you start using this achievement as a way to compare the relative performance of these two AI models—or even the advancement of LLM capabilities over time—there are some important caveats to keep in mind. As it happens, Gemini needed some fairly significant outside help on its path to eventual Pokémon victory. Gemini Plays Pokémon developer JoelZ (who's unaffiliated with Google) will be the first to tell you that Pokémon is ill-suited as a reliable benchmark for LLM models. As hewrites on the project's Twitch FAQ, \"please don't consider this a benchmark for how well an LLM can play Pokémon. You can't really make direct comparisons—Gemini and Claude have different tools and receive different information. ... Claude's framework has many shortcomings so I wanted to see how far Gemini could get if it were given the right tools.\" The difference between those \"framework\" tools in the Claude and Gemini gameplay experiments could go a long way in explaining the relative performance of the two Pokémon-playing models here. As LessWrong's Julian Bradshaw lays outin an excellent overview, Gemini actually gets a bit more information about the game through its custom \"agent harness.\" This harness is the scaffolding that provides an LLM with information about the state of the game (both specific and general), helps the model summarize and \"remember\" previous game actions in its context window, and offers basic tools for moving around and interacting with the game. Since these gameplay harnesses were developed independently, they give slightly different levels of support to the different Pokémon-playing models. While both models use a generated overlay to help make sense of the game's tile-based map screens, for instance, Gemini's harness goes further by adding important information about which tiles are \"passable\" or \"navigable.\" That extra information could be crucial to helping Gemini overcome some key navigation challenges that Claude struggles with. \"It’s pretty easy for me to understand that [an in-game] building is a building and that I can’t walk through a building, and that's [something] that's pretty challenging for Claude to understand,\" Claude Plays Pokémon creator David Hersheytold Ars in March. \"It's funny because it's just kind of smart in different ways, you know?\" Gemini also gets help with navigation through a \"textual representation\" of a minimap, which the harness generates as Gemini explores the game. That kind of direct knowledge of the wider map context outside the current screen can be extremely helpful as Gemini tries to find its way around the Pokémon world. But in his FAQ, JoelZ says he doesn't consider this additional information to be \"cheating\" because \"humans naturally build mental maps while playing games, something current LLMs can't do independently yet. The minimap feature compensates for that limitation.\" The base Gemini model playing the game also occasionally needs some external help from secondary Gemini \"agents\" tailored for specific tasks. One of these agents reasons through a breadth-first-search algorithm to figure out paths through complex mazes. Another is dedicated to generating potential solutions forthe Boulder Puzzle on Victory Road. While Gemini is using its own model and reasoning process for these tasks, it's telling that JoelZ had to specifically graft these specialized agents onto the base model to help it get through some of the game's toughest challenges. As JoelZ writes, \"My interventions improve Gemini’s overall decision-making and reasoning abilities.\" Don't get me wrong, massaging an LLM into a form that can beat a Pokémon game is definitely an achievement. However, the level of \"intervention\" needed to help Gemini with those things that \"LLMs can't do independently yet\" is crucial to keep in mind as we evaluate that success. We already know thatspecially designed reinforcement learning tools can beat Pokémon quite efficiently(and that evena random number generator can beat the game quite inefficiently). The particular resonance of an \"LLM plays Pokémon\" test is in seeing if a generalized language model can reason out its own solution to a complicated game on its own. The more hand-holding we give the model—through external information, tools, or \"harnesses\"—the less useful the game is as that kind of test. Anthropicsaid in Februarythat Claude Plays Pokémon showed \"glimmers of AI systems that tackle challenges with increasing competence, not just through training but with generalized reasoning.\" But as Bradshaw writes on LessWrong, \"without a refined agent harness, [all models] have a hard time simply making it through the very first screen of the game, Red's bedroom!\" Bradshaw'ssubsequent gameplay testswith harness-free LLMs further highlight how these models frequently wander aimlessly, backtrack pointlessly, or even hallucinate impossible game situations. In other words, we're still a long way from the kind of envisioned future where an Artificial General Intelligence can figure out a way to beat Pokémon just because you asked it to.

    "title": "After two court losses, DOGE asks Supreme Court for Social Security data access",
    "article_text": "Trump admin appeals to SCOTUS after two courts ruled DOGE can't access data. The Trump administration filed an emergency application on Friday asking the Supreme Court to restore DOGE's access to Social Security Administration records. A lower-court order that prohibited DOGE's access is causing \"irreparable harm to the executive branch\" and thwarting DOGE's attempts to \"eliminate waste and fraud,\" US Solicitor General John Sauerwrote in the appeal. \"The government cannot eliminate waste and fraud if district courts bar the very agency personnel with expertise and the designated mission of curtailing such waste and fraud from performing their jobs,\" Sauer told the Supreme Court. The preliminary injunction that is currently in place halted \"the Executive Branch's critically important efforts to improve its information-technology infrastructure and eliminate waste,\" the brief said. The appeal was lodged in a case filed by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees; the Alliance for Retired Americans; and American Federation of Teachers. Chief Justice John Robertsaskedthem to file a response to the US by May 12. In March, the plaintiffsobtained an orderthat required the Social Security Administration (SSA) to block DOGE's access to records. US District Judge Ellen Lipton Hollander's order said the DOGE entity created by President Donald Trump \"is essentially engaged in a fishing expedition at SSA, in search of a fraud epidemic, based on little more than suspicion.\" Hollander ordered the SSA to cut off DOGE's access and ruled that Elon Musk and other DOGE members must \"disgorge and delete all non-anonymized PII [personally identifiable information] data in their possession or under their control.\" The District of Maryland judge found that Social Security officials \"provided members of the SSA DOGE Team with unbridled access to the personal and private data of millions of Americans, including but not limited to Social Security numbers, medical records, mental health records, hospitalization records, drivers' license numbers, bank and credit card information, tax information, income history, work history, birth and marriage certificates, and home and work addresses.\" Before turning to the Supreme Court, the Trump administration went to the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and sought an order to stay the lower-court ruling pending appeal. The appeals courtvoted 9–6on April 30 to deny the government's motion. Sauer's appeal to the Supreme Court was filed on behalf of the SSA, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), DOGE Acting Administrator Amy Gleeson, and Musk, who is described in the brief as \"senior advisor to the president.\" Sauer asked the Supreme Court to stay Hollander's injunction and grant \"an immediate administrative stay of the district court's order pending the Court's consideration of this application.\" \"This emergency application presents a now-familiar theme: a district court has issued sweeping injunctive relief without legal authority to do so, in ways that inflict ongoing, irreparable harm on urgent federal priorities and stymie the Executive Branch's functions,\" Sauer wrote. Sauer argued that the organizations suing the government lack standing because their \"members furnished their information with the understanding that government employees could access it for a number of purposes, as those employees are permitted to do pursuant to various exceptions in the Privacy Act of 1974.\" The US brief said the plaintiffs' members \"cannot plausibly claim any concrete injury from havingparticularagency employees—i.e., members of the SSA DOGE team—access their information when those employees are subject to the same legal and ethical obligations against further dissemination that bind all agency employees.\" Hollander wrote in March that the government \"never identified or articulated even a single reason for which the DOGE Team needs unlimited access to SSA's entire record systems, thereby exposing personal, confidential, sensitive, and private information that millions of Americans entrusted to their government.\" In the 4th Circuit's 9–6 ruling against the Trump administration, the majority was composed of judges appointed by Democratic presidents while the judges in the minority were appointed by Republicans. An opinion signed by seven of the circuit judges who voted to uphold the lower-court ruling said that \"the very able district judge has carefully and thoughtfully examined the evidence and the legal issues\" and found that \"the evidence demonstrates that DOGE's work could be accomplished largely with anonymized and redacted data, along with discrete pieces of non-anonymized data in limited, appropriate circumstances—as has long been typical at SSA for the type of technology upgrades and waste, abuse, and fraud detection that DOGE claims to be doing.\" DOGE members were granted data access without being hired by the SSA and without passing background checks, the circuit judges wrote. \"Moreover, the evidence shows that DOGE's unfettered access exceeded that allowed to all but the few most experienced and trusted SSA employees; that such access contravened SSA policy and practices of access limitations and separation of duties; and that DOGE affiliates were granted unfettered access without being properly hired by or detailed to SSA, without standard training, and without mandated background investigations,\" the opinion said. The Privacy Actstatesthat a federal agency may disclose records \"to those officers and employees of the agency which maintains the record who have a need for the record in the performance of their duties.\" Sauer argued that Hollander overstepped her authority when determining that DOGE members didn't need the records. \"That standard is clearly met here; employees charged with modernizing government information systems and routing [sic] out fraud, waste, and abuse in data systems plainly need access to those systems,\" he wrote. \"Yet the district court instead viewed agency employees within the SSA DOGE team as the equivalent of intruders who break into hotel rooms. District courts should not be able to wield the Privacy Act to substitute their own view of the government's 'needs' for that of the President and agency heads.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Software update makes HDR content “unwatchable” on Roku TVs",
    "article_text": "Roku says it's investigating the problem. An update to Roku OS has resulted in colors looking washed out in HDR content viewed on Roku apps, like Disney+. Complaints started surfacing on Roku'scommunity foruma week ago. On May 1, a company representative posted that Roku was “investigating the Disney Plus HDR content that was washed out after the recent update.” However, based on user feedback, it seems that HDR on additional Roku apps, including Apple TV+ and Netflix, are also affected. Roku’s representative has been asking users to share their experiences so that Roku can dig deeper into the problem. One user, going by \"Squinky\" on the forum, reported having a TCL TV with the problem and shared the following photo comparison: Users have reported that both shows and movies viewed in HDR via a Roku OS app are affected. Roku hasn’t provided a list of affected devices, but users have named multiple TCL TV models, at least one Hisense, and one Sharp TV as being impacted. We haven't seen any reports of Roku streaming sticks being affected. One forum user claimed that plugging a Roku streaming stick into a Roku TV circumvented the problem. Forum user Squinky said the washed-out colors were only on Disney+. However, other users have reported seeing the problem across other apps, including Max and Fandango. “I'm surprised more people aren't complaining because it makes a ton of shows simply unwatchable. Was looking forward toAndor, and Tuesday night [was] ruined,\" posted forum user noob99999, who said the problem was happening on “multiple apps,” including Amazon Prime Video. “I hope the post about imminent app updates are correct because in the past, Roku has taken forever to correct issues.” Users have noted that common troubleshooting efforts, like restarting and factory resetting their TVs and checking for software updates, haven’t fixed the problem. On Thursday, frustrated forum user Dominick6404 wrote: If [I] use a different input with the same exact settings, everything still looks great. It's not an issue with the TV itself as Roku keeps telling me when I contact support. I have been rudely hung up on twice and told to buy a new TV twice. The TV works great. HDR is only not displaying proper colors on ROKU APPS. The problems appear to stem from the Roku OS 14.5 update, which was issued at the end of April. According to therelease notes, the update is available for all Roku TV models from 2014 on, except for models 65R648, 75R648, and 75U800GMR. Roku streaming sticks also received the update. Per Roku, the software update includes “various performance optimizations, bug fixes, and improvements to security, stability.”Other additionsinclude a “new personalized row of content within the Live TV Guide” and upgrades to Roku OS’ daily trivia, voice control, and discovery capabilities. Exacerbating the problem, Roku says the update was rolled out automatically, preventing users from delaying or skipping it. Ars Technica has reached out to Roku for comment.

    "title": "Largest deepfake porn site shuts down forever",
    "article_text": "Unknown hero pulls the plug on biggest AI porn platform. The most popular online destination for deepfake porn shut down permanently this weekend, 404 Mediareported. \"Mr. Deepfakes\" drew a swarm of toxic users who, researchersnoted,were willing to pay as much as $1,500 for creators to use advanced face-swapping techniques to make celebrities or other targets appear in non-consensual pornographic videos. At its peak, researchers found that 43,000 videos were viewed more than 1.5 billion times on the platform. The videos were generated by nearly 4,000 creators, who profited from the unethical—and now illegal—sales. But as of this weekend, none of those videos are available to view, and the forums where requests were made for new videos went dark, 404 Media reported. According to a notice posted on the platform, the plug was pulled when \"a critical service provider\" terminated the service \"permanently.\" \"Data loss has made it impossible to continue operation,\" Mr. Deepfakes confirmed, while warning not to trust any impostor platforms that pop up in its absence. \"We will not be relaunching. Any website claiming this is fake. This domain will eventually expire and we are not responsible for future use. This message will be removed around one week.\" It remains unclear exactly which service cut off Mr. Deepfakes, but researchers noted that among the \"most crucial components\" that deepfake creators needed to keep generating the content was \"free-tier cloud GPU access\" provided through Google Colab notebooks. Google did not immediately respond to Ars' request to comment on whether that access was recently yanked. The downfall of Mr. Deepfakes comes just afterCongress passed the Take It Down Act, which makes it illegal to create and distribute non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII), including synthetic NCII generated by artificial intelligence. Any platform notified of NCII has 48 hours to remove it or else face enforcement actions from the Federal Trade Commission. Enforcement won't kick in until next spring, but the service provider may have banned Mr. Deepfakes in response to the passing of the law. Last year, Mr. Deepfakes preemptively started blocking visitors from the United Kingdom after the UK announced intentions to pass a similar law, Wiredreported. The shuttering of Mr. Deepfakes won't solve the problem of deepfakes, though. In 2022, the number of deepfakes skyrocketed as AI technology made the synthetic NCII appear more realistic than ever, prompting anFBI warning in 2023to alert the public that the fake content was being increasingly used in sextortion schemes. But the immediate solutions society used to stop the spread had little impact. For example, in response to pressure to make the fake NCII harder to find,Google started downranking explicit deepfakesin search results but refused to demote platforms like Mr. Deepfakes unless Google received an unspecified \"high volume of removals for fake explicit imagery.\" According to researchers, Mr. Deepfakes—a real person who remains anonymous butreportedlyis a 36-year-old hospital worker in Toronto—created the engine driving this spike. His DeepFaceLab quickly became \"the leading deepfake software, estimated to be the software behind 95 percent of all deepfake videos and has been replicated over 8,000 times on GitHub,\" researchers found. For casual users, his platform hosted videos that could be purchased, usually priced above $50 if it was deemed realistic, while more motivated users relied on forums to make requests or enhance their own deepfake skills to become creators. Mr. Deepfakes' illegal trade began on Reddit but migrated to its own platform after a ban in 2018. There, thousands of deepfake creators shared technical knowledge, with the Mr. Deepfakes site forums eventually becoming \"the only viable source of technical support for creating sexual deepfakes,\" researchersnotedlast year. Having migrated once before, it seems unlikely that this community won't find a new platform to continue generating the illicit content, possibly rearing up under a new name since Mr. Deepfakes seemingly wants out of the spotlight. Back in 2023, researchersestimatedthat the platform had more than 250,000 members, many of whom may quickly seek a replacement or even try to build a replacement. Further increasing the likelihood that Mr. Deepfakes' reign of terror isn't over, the DeepFaceLab GitHub repository—which was archived in November and can no longer be edited—remains available for anyone to copy and use. 404 Media reported that many Mr. Deepfakes members have already connected on Telegram, where synthetic NCII is also reportedly frequently traded. Hany Farid, a professor at UC Berkeley who is a leading expert on digitally manipulated images, told 404 Media that \"while this takedown is a good start, there are many more just like this one, so let’s not stop here.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "F1 in Miami: Like normal F1, but everyone wears pastels",
    "article_text": "The Miami event exemplifies the new breed of F1 venues, but it races well. After a brief reprieve, Formula 1's teams were back at it this past weekend at the Miami Grand Prix. It was the first of three stops in the US and five in North America as F1 capitalizes on its current wave of popularity here. The sport evidently believes something is going right—it just announced a contract extension that will see the event remain on the calendar for another 16 years. The Miami race is among the latest of F1's new breed of Grands Prix. It was originally supposed to be more of a true street circuit like Baku or Singapore or Las Vegas, with a route that crossed over a bridge into South Beach. But the track is laid out around the various parking lots of Miami's Hard Rock Stadium, like a 21st-century version of the early '80s Caesars Palace Grands Prix or the now-defunct Sochi race that wound its way around Vladimir Putin's favorite sea-side theme park. Ticket prices appear to have come down a little now that the race is in its third year, but the \"beach club\" and Potemkin marina remain, even if they didn't look particularly busy on any of the overhead shots. Despite what looked like sparse attendance on Friday and Saturday, we're told that 275,000 people attended across the weekend. Some might find the Miami venue a little brash, but there's no denying it races well. And not just with F1—check out the F1 Academy race if you can, where we saw Doriene Pin demonstrate her considerable talent yet again, winning from sixth on the grid, this time with extremely stiff competition from Alisha Palmowski. Still, as a longtime F1 fan, it is hard to reconcile a contract extension until 2041 for this parkinglot event when Spa-Francorchamps—not only the best track on the calendar but also one with decades of racing history—will have to alternate with other events, so there will be no Belgian Grand Prix in 2028 or 2030. This is particularly true as F1's own press release notes that 380,000 people went to the Belgian race weekend last year. It's hard to even think what F1 will look like as it goes into the 2040s. By then, Formula E's exclusive rights to be the FIA's electric single-seater championship will have expired. Could we see an all-electric F1? It's certainly possible by then. In the meantime, the agitation from some corners to change the next set of technical regulations, which go into effect next year, seems to be done. Instead,we learned from The Racethat all is not entirely well withF1's synthetic fuels. These are to be introduced next year as part of the sport's efforts to become carbon-neutral by 2030. But costs are escalating, with fears that these synthetic fuels could cost more than $1,000 per gallon—it's a good thing fuel is excluded from next year's cost cap. This weekend was another sprint event, where a short race on Saturday morning replaces one of the practice sessions. It was delayed by a heavy downpour that saw Charles Leclerc's Ferrari wreck into the wall on its way to the grid. Ferrari—wearing a ghastly livery that looked too much like the Russian flag—got caught out by the timing of the rain, and Leclerc's intermediate tires were no match for the standing water he encountered and then aquaplaned upon. Mercedes' teenage phenom Kimi Antonelli scored his first pole position to start the sprint alongside McLaren's Oscar Piastri, who beat the youngster to the turn 1 apex at the start. Antonelli's day got worse when he had to call off a pit stop after Red Bull released Max Verstappen into his path in the pit lane, effectively performing a drive-through penalty as a result. Sprint races don't normally involve tire changes, but in this case, the track dried to the point that slick tires were a much faster option, even with the time lost changing them. Piastri ended the sprint displeased, too. He made his own tire stop, relinquishing the lead to his teammate Lando Norris, who went into the pits for dry tires of his own just as a crash brought out a safety car. With Piastri forced to circulate at a much slower pace behind the safety car, Norris had time to change his tires and remain in the lead until the end of the race. Yet again, Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton did well in the sprint, making it to the third step of the podium. Hamilton was much closer to his Ferrari teammate Leclerc this weekend, which would perhaps be encouraging if not for the fact that Leclerc was also just slow. In fact, both Williams cars outqualified the Ferraris for the main race, although Carlos Sainz finished just behind the pair of them on Sunday. Rain canceled Sunday's F1 Academy race and threatened to interrupt or affect the main event. But the worst of it was some spray during the driver parade, which this time made use of somefull-size Lego F1 cars. The race was to be dry, fast, and furious. Max Verstappen had dragged his car to pole position for Sunday's race and kept his elbows out at turn 2 at the start to force Norris off at the apex, dropping the McLaren driver from second to sixth place. A virtual safety car interrupted the race as Alpine's Jack Doohan got wrecked. It was a terrible weekend for the Australian, who had his sprint-qualifying session ruined by his own team and is now almost certain to be replaced at the next race by Franco Colapinto. Piastri made rather quick work of Antonelli, who was in second, then got past Verstappen to take the lead with a clinically precise move on lap 14. It took Norris a little longer to deal with the reigning World Champion, four laps in which Norris lost a second a lap to Piastri before he slotted into second place. From there, the pair of McLarens disappeared off into the distance. Last time,I wrote about how close the entire grid has becomeunder this latest set of rules. The race in Miami bucked that trend as the McLaren showed much faster race pace than anyone else, thanks in large part to much higher track temperatures. Third place went to George Russell, who is getting the most out of his Mercedes every time he straps in. Even so, Russell was more than half a minute behind the orange-and-black cars at the checkered flag. Piastri now leads Norris in the championship by 16 points.

    "title": "On cusp of storm season, NOAA funding cuts put hurricane forecasting at risk",
    "article_text": "Tropical cyclone track forecasts are 75 percent more accurate than they were in 1990. TheNational Hurricane Center’s forecasts in 2024were its most accurate on record, from its one-day forecasts, as tropical cyclones neared the coast, to its forecasts five days into the future, when storms were only beginning to come together. Thanks to federally funded research, forecasts of tropical cyclone tracks today are up to75 percent more accuratethan they were in 1990. A National Hurricane Center forecast three days out today is about as accurate as a one-day forecast in 2002, giving people in the storm’s path more time to prepare and reducing the size of evacuations. Accuracy will be crucial again in 2025, as meteorologistspredict another active Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30. Yet,cuts in staffingandthreats to fundingat the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration—which includes the National Hurricane Center and National Weather Service—are diminishing operations that forecasters rely on. I ama meteorologistwho studies lightning in hurricanes and helps train other meteorologists to monitor and forecast tropical cyclones. Here are three of the essential components of weather forecasting that have been targeted for cuts to funding and staff at NOAA. To understand how a hurricane is likely to behave, forecasters need to know what’s going on in the atmosphere far from the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Hurricanes are steered by the winds around them. Wind patterns detected today over the Rocky Mountains and Great Plains—places like Colorado, Wyoming, Nebraska, and South Dakota—give forecasters clues to the winds that will be likely along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts in the days ahead. Satellites can’t take direct measurements, so to measure these winds, scientists rely on weather balloons. That data is essential both for forecasts and tocalibrate the complicated formulas forecasters use to make estimatesfrom satellite data. However, in early 2025, the Trump administrationterminatedorsuspendedweatherballoon launchesatmore thanadozen locations. That move and other cuts and threatened cuts at NOAA have raised red flags for forecasters across the country and around the world. Forecasters everywhere, from TV to private companies, rely on NOAA’s data to do their jobs. Much of that data would be extremely expensive if not impossible to replicate. Under normal circumstances, weather balloons are released from around 900 locations around the world at 8 am and 8 pm Eastern time every day. While the loss of just 12 of these profiles may not seem significant, small amounts of missing data can lead to big forecast errors. This is an example ofchaos theory, more popularly known as the butterfly effect. The balloons carry a small instrumentcalled a radiosonde, which records data as it rises from the surface of the Earth to around 120,000 feet above ground. The radiosonde acts like an all-in-one weather station, beaming back details of the temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, and air pressure every 15 feet through its flight. Together, all these measurements help meteorologistsinterpret the atmosphere overheadand feed intocomputer modelsused to help forecast weather around the country, including hurricanes. Formore than 80 years, scientists have been flying planes into hurricanes to measure each storm’s strength andhelp forecastits path and potential for damage. Known as “Hurricane Hunters,” these crews from theUS Air Force ReserveandNOAAroutinely conduct reconnaissance missions throughout hurricane season using a variety of instruments. Similar to weather balloons, these flights are making measurements that satellites can’t. Hurricane Huntersuse Doppler radar to gauge how the wind is blowing and LiDARto measure temperature and humidity changes. They drop probes to measure the ocean temperature down several hundred feet to tell how much warm water might be there to fuel the storm. They also release20 to 30 dropsondes, measuring devices with parachutes. As the dropsondes fall through the storm, they transmit data about the temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and air pressure every 15 feet or so from the plane to the ocean. Dropsondes from Hurricane Hunter flights are the only way to directly measure what is occurring inside the storm. Although satellites and radars can see inside hurricanes, these are indirect measurements that do not have the fine-scale resolution of dropsonde data. That data tells National Hurricane Center forecasters how intense the storm is and whether the atmosphere around the storm is favorable for strengthening. Dropsonde data also helps computer models forecast the track and intensity of storms days into the future. Two NOAA Hurricane Hunter flight directors werelaid off in February 2025, leaving only six, when 10 are preferred. Directors are the flight meteorologists aboard each flight who oversee operations and ensure the planes stay away from the most dangerous conditions. Having fewer directors limits the number of flights that can be sent out during busy times when Hurricane Hunters are monitoring multiple storms. And that would limit the accurate data the National Hurricane Center would have for forecasting storms. Weather satellites that monitor tropical storms from space provide continuous views of each storm’s track and intensity changes. The equipment on these satellites and software used to analyze it make increasingly accurate hurricane forecasts possible. Much of that equipment is developed by federally funded researchers. For example, theCooperative InstitutesinWisconsinandColoradohavedeveloped softwareand methods that help meteorologists better understand the current state of tropical cyclones andforecast future intensitywhen aircraft reconnaissance isn’t immediately available. Forecasting rapid intensification is one of the great challenges for hurricane scientists. It’s the dangerous shift when a tropical cyclone’s wind speeds jump by at least 35 mph (56 kilometers per hour) in 24 hours. For example, in 2018,Hurricane Michael’s rapid intensificationcaught the Florida Panhandle by surprise. The Category 5 stormcaused billions of dollarsin damage across the region, including at Tyndall Air Force Base, where severalF-22 Stealth Fighters were still in hangars. Under thefederal budget proposaldetailsreleased so far, including a draft of agencies’ budget plans marked up by Trump’s Office of Management and Budget, known as the passback, there isno funding for Cooperative Institutes. There is also no funding for aircraft recapitalization. A2022 NOAA plansought to purchase up to six new aircraft that would be used by Hurricane Hunters. The passback budget also cut funding for some technology from future satellites, includinglightning mappersthat are used in hurricane intensity forecasting and to warn airplanes of risks. Tropical storms and hurricanes can have devastating effects, asHurricanes HeleneandMiltonreminded the country in 2024. These storms, while well forecast, resulted in billions of dollars of damage and hundreds of fatalities. The US has beenfacing more intense storms, and thecoastal populationand value of property in harm’s way are growing. As five former directors of the National Weather Servicewrote in an open letter, cutting funding and staff from NOAA’s work that is improving forecasting and warnings ultimately threatens to leave more lives at risk.

    "title": "SpaceX pushed “sniper” theory with the feds far more than is publicly known",
    "article_text": "\"It came out of nowhere, and it was really violent.\" The rocket was there. And then it decidedly wasnot. Shortly after sunrise on a late summer morning nearly nine years ago at SpaceX's sole operational launch pad, engineers neared the end of a static fire test. These were still early days for their operation of a Falcon 9 rocket that used super-chilled liquid propellants, and engineers pressed to see how quickly they could complete fueling. This was because the liquid oxygen and kerosene fuel warmed quickly in Florida's sultry air, and cold propellants were essential to maximizing the rocket's performance. On this morning, September 1, 2016, everything proceeded more or less nominally up until eight minutes before the ignition of the rocket's nine Merlin engines. It was a stable point in the countdown, so no one expected what happened next. \"I saw the first explosion,\" John Muratore, launch director for the mission, told me. \"It came out of nowhere, and it was really violent. I swear, that explosion must have taken an hour. It felt like an hour. But it was only a few seconds. The second stage exploded in this huge ball of fire, and then the payload kind of teetered on top of the transporter erector. And then it took a swan dive off the top rails, dove down, and hit the ground. And then it exploded.\" The dramatic loss of the Falcon 9 rocket and its Amos-6 satellite,captured on videoby a commercial photographer, came at a pivotal moment for SpaceX and the broader commercial space industry. It was SpaceX's second rocket failure in a little more than a year, and it occurred as NASA was betting heavily on the company to carry its astronauts to orbit. SpaceX was not the behemoth it is today, a company valued at $350 billion. It remained vulnerable to the vicissitudes of the launch industry. This violent failure shook everyone, from the engineers in Florida to satellite launch customers to the suits at NASA headquarters in Washington, DC. As part of my book on the Falcon 9 and Dragon years at SpaceX,Reentry, I reported deeply on the loss of the Amos-6 mission. In the weeks afterward, the greatest mystery was what had precipitated the accident. It was understood that a pressurized helium tank inside the upper stage had ruptured. But why? No major parts on the rocket were moving at the time of the failure. It was, for all intents and purposes, akin to an automobile idling in a driveway with half a tank of gasoline. And then it exploded. This failure gave rise to one of the oddest—but also strangely compelling—stories of the 2010s in spaceflight. And we're still learning new things today. The lack of a concrete explanation for the failure led SpaceX engineers to pursue hundreds of theories. One was the possibility that an outside \"sniper\" had shot the rocket. This theory appealed to SpaceX founder Elon Musk, who was asleep at his home in California when the rocket exploded. Within hours of hearing about the failure, Musk gravitated toward the simple answer of a projectile being shot through the rocket. This is not as crazy as it sounds, and other engineers at SpaceX aside from Musk entertained the possibility, as some circumstantial evidence to support the notion of an outside actor existed. Most notably, the first rupture in the rocket occurred about 200 feet above the ground, on the side of the vehicle facing the southwest. In this direction, about one mile away, lay a building leased by SpaceX's main competitor in launch, United Launch Alliance. A separate video indicated a flash on the roof of this building, now known as the Spaceflight Processing Operations Center. The timing of this flash matched the interval it would take a projectile to travel from the building to the rocket. A sniper on the roof of a competitor's building—forget theRight Stuff, this was the stuff of a Mission: Impossible or James Bond movie. At Musk's direction, SpaceX worked this theory both internally and externally. Within the company, engineers and technicians actually took pressurized tanks that stored helium—one of these had burst, leading to the explosion—and shot at them in Texas to determine whether they would explode and what the result looked like. Externally, they sent the site director for their Florida operations, Ricky Lim, to inquire whether he might visit the roof of the United Launch Alliance building. SpaceX pursued the sniper theory for more than a month. A few SpaceX employees told me that they did not stop this line of inquiry until the Federal Aviation Administration sent the company a letter definitively saying that there was no gunman involved. It would be interesting to see this letter, so I submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the FAA in the spring of 2023. Because the federal FOIA process moves slowly, I did not expect to receive a response in time for the book. But it was worth a try anyway. No reply came in 2023 or early 2024, when the final version of my book was due to my editor.Reentrywas published last September, and still nothing. However, last week, to my great surprise and delight, I got a response from the FAA. It was the very letter I requested, sent from the FAA to Tim Hughes, the general counsel of SpaceX, on October 13, 2016. And yes, the letter says there was no gunman involved. However, there were other things I did not know—namely, that the FBI had also investigated the incident. One of the most compelling elements of this story is that it involves SpaceX's heated rival, United Launch Alliance. For a long time, ULA had the upper hand, but in recent years, it has taken a dramatic turn. Now we know that David would grow up and slay Goliath: Between the final rocket ULA launched last year (the Vulcan test flight on October 4) and the first rocket the company launched this year (Atlas V, April 28), SpaceX launched 90 rockets. Ninety. But it was a different story in the summer of 2016 in the months leading up to the Amos 6 failure. Back then, ULA was launching about 15 rockets a year, compared to SpaceX's five. And ULA was launching all of the important science missions for NASA and the critical spy satellites for the US military. They were the big dog, SpaceX the pup. In the early days of the Falcon 9 rocket, some ULA employees would drive to where SpaceX was working on the first booster and jeer at their efforts. And rivalry played out not just on the launch pad but in courtrooms and on Capitol Hill. After ULA won an $11 billion block buy contract from the US Air Force to launch high-value military payloads into the early 2020s, Musk sued in April 2014. He alleged that the contract had been awarded without a fair competition and said the Falcon 9 rocket could launch the missions at a substantially lower price. Taxpayers, he argued, were being taken for a ride. Eventually, SpaceX and the Air Force resolved their claims. The Air Force agreed to open some of its previously awarded national security missions to competitive bids. Over time, SpaceX has overtaken ULA even in this arena. During the most recent round of awards,SpaceX won 60 percent of the contractscompared to ULA's 40 percent. So when SpaceX raised the possibility of a ULA sniper, it came at an incendiary moment in the rivalry, when SpaceX was finally putting forth a very serious challenge to ULA's dominance and monopoly. It is no surprise, therefore, that ULA told SpaceX's Ricky Lim to get lost when he wanted to see the roof of their building in Florida. NASA officials were also deeply concerned by the loss of the Falcon 9 rocket in September 2016. The space agency spent much of the 2010s working with SpaceX and Boeing to develop, test, and fly spacecraft that could fly humans into space. These were difficult years for the space agency, which had to rely on Russia to get its astronauts into space. NASA also had a challenging time balancing costs with astronaut safety. Then rockets started blowing up. Consider this sequence from mid-2015 to mid-2016. In June 2015, the second stage of a Falcon 9 rocket carrying a cargo version of the Dragon spacecraft into orbit exploded.Less than two weeks later, NASA named four astronauts to its \"commercial crew\" cadre from which the initial pilots of Dragon and Starliner spacecraft would be selected. Finally, a little more than a year after this, a second Falcon 9 rocket upper stage detonated. Even as it was losing Falcon 9 rockets, SpaceX revealed that it intended to upend NASA's long-standing practice of fueling a rocket and then, when the vehicle reached a stable condition, putting crew on board. Rather, SpaceX said it would put the astronauts on board before fueling. This process became known as \"load and go.\" NASA's safety community went nuts. \"When SpaceX came to us and said we want to load the crew first and then the propellant, mushroom clouds went off in our safety community,\" Phil McAlister, the head of NASA's commercial programs, told me forReentry. \"I mean, hair-on-fire stuff. It was just conventional wisdom that you load the propellant first and get it thermally stable. Fueling is a very dynamic operation. The vehicle is popping and hissing. The safety community was adamantly against this.\" Amos-6 compounded these concerns. That's because the rocket was not shot by a sniper. After months of painful investigation and analysis, engineers determined the rocket was lost due to the propellant-loading process. In their goal of rapidly fueling the Falcon 9 rocket, the SpaceX teams had filled the pressurized helium tanks too quickly, heating the aluminum liner and causing it to buckle. In their haste to load super-chilled propellant onto the Falcon 9, SpaceX had found its speed limit. At NASA, it was not difficult to visualize astronauts in a Dragon capsule sitting atop an exploding rocket during propellant loading rather than a commercial satellite. We should stop and appreciate the crucible that SpaceX engineers and technicians endured in the fall of 2016. They were simultaneously attempting to tease out the physics of a fiendishly complex failure; prove to NASA their exploding rocket was safe; convince safety officials that even though they had just blown up their rocket by fueling it too quickly, load-and-go was feasible for astronaut missions; increase the cadence of Falcon 9 missions to catch and surpass ULA; and, oh yes, gently explain to the boss that a sniper had not shot their rocket. So there had to be some relief when, on October 13, Hughes received that letter from Dr. Michael C. Romanowski, director of Commercial Space Integration at the FAA. According to this letter (see a copy here), three weeks after the launch pad explosion, SpaceX submitted \"video and audio\" along with its analysis of the failure to the FAA. \"SpaceX suggested that in the company's view, this information and data could be indicative of sabotage or criminal activity associated with the on-pad explosion of SpaceX's Falcon 9,\" the letter states. This is notable because it suggests that Musk directed SpaceX to elevate the \"sniper\" theory to the point that the FAA should take it seriously. But there was more. According to the letter, SpaceX reported the same data and analysis to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Florida. After this, the Tampa Field Office of the FBI and its Criminal Investigative Division in Washington, DC, looked into the matter. And what did they find? Nothing, apparently. \"The FBI has informed us that based upon a thorough and coordinated review by the appropriate Federal criminal and security investigative authorities, there were no indications to suggest that sabotage or any other criminal activity played a role in the September 1 Falcon 9 explosion,\" Romanowski wrote. \"As a result, the FAA considers this matter closed.\" The failure of the Amos-6 mission would turn out to be a low point for SpaceX. For a few weeks, there were non-trivial questions about the company's financial viability. But soon, SpaceX would come roaring back. In 2017, the Falcon 9 rocket launched a record 18 times, surpassing ULA for the first time. The gap would only widen. Last year, SpaceX launched 137 rockets to ULA's five. With Amos-6, therefore, SpaceX lost the battle. But it would eventually win the war—without anyone firing a shot.

    "title": "The Last of Us packs new characters and new revelations into its latest episode",
    "article_text": "Plus: Kyle and Andrew discuss '80s pop covers and free jazz. No, seriously... New episodes of season 2 ofThe Last of Usare premiering on HBO every Sunday night, and Ars' Kyle Orland (who's played the games) and Andrew Cunningham (who hasn't)will be talking about them here after they air. While these recaps don't delve into every single plot point of the episode, there are obviouslyheavy spoilerscontained within, so go watch the episode first if you want to go in fresh. Kyle: We start this episode from the perspective of a band of highly armed FEDRA agents in 2018 Seattle, shooting the shit in a transport that somehow still has usable gasoline. Maybe it's just the political moment we're in, but I was not quite emotionally prepared for these militarized characters in my post-apocalyptic escape show to start casually using \"voters\" as an ironic signifier for regular people. \"LOL, like we'd ever let them vote, amirite?\" Andrew: We've spent so little time with FEDRA—the post-collapse remnant of what had once been the US government—since the very opening episodes of the show that you can forget exactly why nearly every other individual and organization in the show's world hates it and wants nothing to do with it. But here's a reminder for us: casual cruelty, performed by ignorant fascists. Of course as soon as you see and hear Jeffrey Wright, you know he's going to be A Guy (he's an HBO alum fromBoardwalk EmpireandWestworld, among many, many other film, TV, vocal, and stage performances). He just as casually betrays and blows up the transport full of jumped-up FEDRA jarheads, which is a clear prestige TV storytelling signifier. Here is a Man With A Code, but also a Man To Be Feared. Kyle: Yeah, Isaac's backstory was only broadly hinted at in the games, so getting to see this big \"Who This Character Is\" moment in the show was pretty effective. What I found less effective was Ellie playing a very able A-Ha cover when she discovers the abandoned guitar room. In the game it serves as a welcome change of pace from a lot of frenetic action, and a good excuse for an endearing guitar-playing mini-game. Here it felt like it just kind of dragged on, with a lot of awkward dwelling on close-ups of Dina's creepily enamored face. Andrew: You know what, though, I do appreciate that the show at least made an effort to explain why this 30-year-old guitar was still in pristine condition. I don'tinstantlybuy that the silica gel packets (which Ellie, wisely, does not eat) in the guitar case would have lasted for that long, but at least she didn't pull a mossy guitar straight off the wall and start tuning it up. Those strings are gonna corrode! That neck is gonna warp! I do also think the show (and the game, I guess, picking up your context clues) got away with picking one of the goofiest songs they possibly could that would still read as \"soulful and emotionally resonant\" when played solo on acoustic guitar. But I suppose that's always beenthe power of that particular instrument. Kyle: Not to cut short \"Guitar Talk,\" but the show cuts it off with a creepy scene of Isaac talking about high-end cookware to an initially unseen companion on the floor. The resulting scene of torture is, for my money, way worse than most anything we're exposed to in the games—and these are games that are not exactly squeamish about showing scenes of torture and extreme violence! Felt to me like they're taking advantage of HBO's reputation for graphic content just because they could, here... Andrew: Definitely gratuitous! But not totally without storytelling utility. I do think, if you're setting Isaac up to be a mid-season miniboss on the road to the Dramatic Confrontation with Abby, that you've got to make it especially clear that he is capable of really nasty things. Sure, killing a truckful of guys is ALSO bad, but they were guys that we as viewers are all supposed to hate. Torturing a defenseless man reinforces the perception of him as someone that Ellie and Dina donotwant to meet, especially now that they've popped a couple of his guys. Because Ellie and Dina have unwittingly wandered into the middle of a Seattle civil war of sorts, between Isaac and his militarized WLF members and the face-cutting cultists we briefly met in the middle of last episode. And while the WLF types do seem to have the cult outgunned, we are told here that WLF members are slowly defecting to the cult (rather than the other way around). Kyle: I will say I appreciated the surprisingly cogent history of the \"chicken and egg games\" beef between the two factions, as discussed between torturer and torture victim. Definitely a memorable bit of world-building. But then we're quickly back to the kind of infected attack scene that now seems practically contractually obligated to happen at least once an episode. At this point, I think these kinds of massive setpiece zombie battles would work better as a light seasoning than a thick sauce that just gets dumped on us almost every week. Andrew: People in and from Seattle seem to have a unique gift for kicking up otherwise dormant swarms of infected! I know we'll get back to it eventually, but I was more intrigued by the first episode's reveal of more strategic infected that seemed to be retaining more of their human traits than I am by these screaming mindless hordes. Here, I think the tension is also ratcheted up artificially by Ellie's weird escape strategy, which is to lead the two of them through a series of dead ends and cul-de-sacs before finally, barely, getting away. But like you said, gotta have zombies on the zombie show! And it does finally make the \"Dina finds out that Ellie is immune\" shoe drop, though Dina doesn't seem ready to think through any of the other implications of that reveal just yet. She has her own stuff going on! Andrew: It does explain a couple of things! It does seem like a bit of a narrative shortcut to make Ellie extremely invested in Dina and whether she lives or dies, and given this show I am worried that this zygote is only going to be used to create more trauma for Ellie, rather than giving us a nuanced look at parenting during an apocalypse. But it is sweet to see how enthusiastically and immediately Ellie gets invested. A question for you, while spoiling as little as you can: Are we still mostly just adapting the game at this point? You'd mentioned getting more Isaac backstory (sometimes the show expands on backstories well andsometimes it doesn't), and some things have happened a bit out of order. But my impression is that we haven't gotten a full departure a la the Nick Offerman episode from last season yet. Kyle: At this point it's kind of like a jazz riff on what happens in the game, with some bits copied note for note, some remixed and thrown into entirely different temporal locations, and some fresh new improv thrown in for good measure. I'm definitely not a \"the game is canon and you must interpret it literally\" type of person, but the loose treatment is giving me a bit of whiplash. The reveal of Dina's pregnancy, for instance, is not greeted with nearly as much immediate joy in the games. That said, the moment of joy Ellie and Dinadoshare here feels transplanted (in tone if nothing else) from an earlier game scene that the show had mostly skipped thus far. It's like free association, man. Dig it! The show also spends an inordinate amount of time discussing how pregnancy tests work in the post-apocalypse, which for me pushed past world-building and into overexplaining. It's OK to just let stuff be sometimes, y'know? Andrew: It's jazz, man. It's about the zombies youdon'tkill. However it's been rearranged, I can still tell I'm watching a video game adaptation, because there are stealth kills and because important information is conveyed via messages and logos scrawled in blood on the walls. But I am still enjoying myself, and doingslightlyless minute-to-minute missing of Joel than I did last episode. Slightly. The episode ends with Ellie and Dina hearing the name of someone who has the same name as someone who knew Abby over a WLF walkie-talkie they nabbed, which gives them their next objective marker for Abby Quest. But they've got to cross an active war zone to get where they're going (though I couldn't tell from that distance whether we're meant to be able to tell exactly who is fighting who at the moment).

    "article_text": "After memorable turns inCaptain America: Civil Warand Disney+ seriesThe Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Daniel BrÃ¼hl’s Baron Zemo almost got the call forMarvel’sThunderbolts. But it wasn’t meant to be for the character, who started out as a big bad but becamemore sympatheticthe longer he hung around the MCUâwhich does sound kind of perfect for the misfit team-up movie. He also has quite a few ties to the Thunderbolts in the comics. Speaking toScreenrant,one ofThunderbolts‘ writersexplained Baron Zemo was actually part of an early draft of the film, back to his villainous ways. “I think there was a version of a tag written a long time ago [where] it was revealed that Baron Zemo was pulling some strings from prison or whatever,” Eric Pearson explained, though he wasn’t 100% certain of the details. “I feel like there might’ve been a version where a tag where Zemo had broken out and swapped places with someone … [but] I think those ideas lived for one iteration and then died. Sometimes people think that we’re zagging on purpose, and it’s like, ‘No, we know that Zemo is very integral to a different story version of them.’ He’s part of putting [the Thunderbolts] together, and we negated the need for that with our very premise.” Pearson pointed out that with Yelena being the center of the story, and the introduction of the Bob character, Zemo “just didn’t fit,” as much asThunderboltsdid keep its source material in mind. “There’s always the discussion of, ‘Well, if there’s a way to cleverly include Baron Zemo in this, he absolutely should be there,'” he said.

    "title": "The Shingles Vaccine Could Be a Secret Weapon Against Heart Attacks",
    "article_text": "The benefits of avoiding shingles through vaccinations are piling up. New research out this week has found a link between getting vaccinated for shingles and a reduced risk of heart attacks and strokes. Researchers from Kyung Hee University in South Korea led the study,publishedMonday in the European Heart Journal. They studied the medical records of over a million South Korean residents, finding that shingles-vaccinated people were noticeably less likely to develop cardiovascular disease than unvaccinated people. The findings are the latest to indicate that shingles is even worse for our health than currently thought. “This suggests that the vaccine may provide not only protection against shingles itself but also potential benefits for heart health,” study researcher Sooji Lee told Gizmodo in an email. Shinglesis caused by the varicella zoster virus, the same germ that causes chickenpox in children. Though chickenpox is usually short-lasting, if unpleasant, the virus can survive the initial immune response and lie dormant in our bodies for decades. When our immune system gets weaker, usually due to age, the virus can reactivate and trigger a new infection that we call shingles. This second bout is typically worse, causing symptoms like excruciating pain and rashes that last for several weeks. Sometimes, shingles can even leave behind lingering, potentially lifelong nerve pain. Unique Study Is Latest to Show Shingles Vaccine Can Help Prevent Dementia As bad as shingles is, ongoing research suggests it may also increase the risk of future health problems. Multiple studies have linked shingles to a greater risk ofAlzheimer’s disease and dementia, for instanceâand conversely, a lower risk of dementia has been linked to shingles vaccination. Some studies havealsosuggestedthat shingles can cause heart complications after infection. But according to the researchers, there hasn’t been extensive research looking into whether vaccination can prevent these problems from arising. In South Korea, healthcare is largely covered through asingle-payer, publicly funded system.This system means that scientists can more easily study the health of South Korea’s population using de-identified (anonymous) data. The researchers cross-referenced different sources of data to track the shingles vaccination status and cardiovascular health of South Korean residents aged 50 and above starting in 2012, when the vaccine first became available in the country. They ultimately found that shingles vaccination was associated with a 23% lower risk of any new cardiovascular condition, along with a 26% lower risk of major cardiovascular events (heart attacks and strokes) and a 26% lower risk of heart failure. The associated reduction in cardiovascular disease was strongest in the first two to three years following vaccination, but could still be seen up to eight years later. The protection from vaccination also appeared to be stronger in men, people in poorer pre-existing health, and people living in rural or low-income neighborhoods. “Because our study was conducted in a large general population, these findings may be broadly applicable,” Lee said. These sorts of studies are observational, meaning that they can’t definitively prove a causative link between two factors, only show a correlation (in this case, between shingles vaccination and reduced heart disease). But the authors note that shingles can cause inflammation, clots, and general blood vessel damageâall known risk factors for cardiovascular disease. They also speculate that the nerve damage caused by shingles could possibly disturb our heart rhythm, which can trigger problems like cardiac arrest. Another consideration is that the researchers only studied the potential effects of an older shingles vaccine, Zostavax, one that uses a weakened version of the virus to generate immunity. That vaccine has largely been replaced by a different type of shingles vaccine namedShingrixthat only uses a protein from the virus. This newer vaccine is more effective at preventing shingles, and some research has suggested that it might offergreater protectionfrom dementia as well. Lee says that her team is now planning to study whether Shingrix can potentially offer the same level of protection against cardiovascular disease as the older vaccineâor even better. All that said, shingles can be extremely unpleasant, so getting vaccinated against it is already worthwhile. If we’re lucky, the vaccine might boost our brain and heart health, too.

    "title": "Hugo Administrators Resign in Wake of ChatGPT Controversy",
    "article_text": "Another year,yetanotherHugo Awards-adjacent controversy? That might be what fans of sci-fi lit and related media are thinking, with news today that a trio of leaders from the Seattle 2025 Worldcon, the upcoming iteration of the convention where the Hugos are annually presented, have resigned. This year, at least, the awards themselvesâvoted on by members of the World Science Fiction Society (WSFS)âseemingly aren’t directly involved in the dust-up. In apost on Blueskyco-signed by Hugo administrator Nicholas Whyte, deputy Hugo administrator Esther MacCallum-Stewart, and World Science Fiction Society division head Cassidy, the trio announced they were resigning from their roles ahead of the Seattle event, which takes place in August. “We want to reaffirm that no LLMs or generative AI have been used in the Hugo Awards process at any stage,” the statement read in part, which might turn the heads of anyone who is a) interested in the Hugos, but b) not up on the latest controversy. However, plenty of people in the community are well aware of what’s been going on. A quick journey tothe blog File 770will bring you up to speed, as will a visit to Seattle Worldcon 2025’s own site, whichon April 30shared a post clarifying exactly what role AI played in the upcoming event. “We have received questions regarding Seattleâs use of AI tools in our vetting process for program participants,” Seattle Worldcon 2025 chair Kathy Bond wrote. “In the interest of transparency, we will explain the process of how we are using a Large Language Model (LLM). We understand that members of our community have very reasonable concerns and strong opinions about using LLMs. Please be assured that no data other than a proposed panelistâs name has been put into the LLM script that was used. Letâs repeat that point: no data other than a proposed panelistâs name has been put into the LLM script. The sole purpose of using the LLM was to streamline the online search process used for program participant vetting, and rather than being accepted uncritically, the outputs were carefully analyzed by multiple members of our team for accuracy.” Bond’s post goes on to explain that “using this process saved literally hundreds of hours of volunteer staff time, and we believe it resulted in more accurate vetting after the step of checking any purported negative results. We have also not utilized an LLM in any other aspect of our program or convention.” That last line is what today’s resignation post from Whyte, MacCallum-Stewart, and Cassidy also emphasized: that the Hugos themselves were not pulled into this process, which was meant to help Seattle Worldcon 2025 more efficiently compile the panels it offers to convention attendees. Bond later postedan additional messageon May 2, re-iterating her apology about using ChatGPT as part of the convention’s program vetting. “Additionally, I regret releasing a statement that did not address the concerns of our community,” she shared. “My initial statement on the use of AI tools in program vetting was incomplete, flawed, and missed the most crucial points. I acknowledge my mistake and am truly sorry for the harm it caused.” However, asFile 770 pointed out, the damage has apparently already been done: the use of ChatGPT in any capacity in connection to Worldcon created a furor on social media. It also inspired at least one Hugo nominee to remove their book from contention: Yoon Ha Lee, whoseMoonstormwas named a Lodestar Award finalist, which honors YA releases. In a May 1 post onBluesky, the author linked to the April 30 Worldcon blog post noted above, and noted he was withdrawing the title from consideration. Then, ina post shared todayresponding toFile 770’s latest postannouncing the resignations, the author wrote “All respect and I’m grateful to them for their work, sorry [things] came to this pass.” Seattle Worldcon 2025 takes place August 13-17; the Hugo Awards will be handed out August 16.

    "title": "Trump Says He Wants His Movie Tariffs to Help Hollywood, Not Hurt It",
    "article_text": "After delivering his solution to bring more jobs back to the film industry stateside byimplementing tariffs on international film production, President Trump attempted to clarify his intentions at a White House briefing.CNBCÂ reports that Trump will talk to the studios about his idea to impose100% tariffson films made outside the United States with the aim to make sure âtheyâre happyâ with the haphazardly conceived and confused notions about how the film industry could align withhis presidential plans. âIâm not looking to hurt the industry, I want to help the industry,â he told reporters. Incidentally plans for keeping the film industry at large here were already in the works. Post Los Angeles wildfires, which halted the film industry for the first quarter of the year, California Governor Gavin Newsom and organizations likeStay in LAwere already proposing solutions to keep productions in Americaâparticularly the state of California, the home of Hollywood movie making, in response to relief efforts and to keep people able to live in the state. In Trump’s clarified statements reported by CNBC, he attempted to call out Newsom with the claims that the industry âhas been decimated by other countries taking them out, and also by incompetence, like in Los Angeles, the governor [Gavin Newsom] is a grossly incompetent man, heâs just allowed it to be taken away from.â The politician’s representation re-iterated Newsom’s already in the works plans and how Trump’s sudden support could be reigned in for the industry that kept Trump relevant beyond what anyone could imagine. “[Newsom’s] plan to more than double the stateâs film and television tax credit reflects a commitment to keeping production here at home, supporting workers and maintaining Californiaâs global leadership in entertainment,â the spokesperson added that. âIf the President announces a proposal with more details, we will review it.â Currently organizations such as Stay in LA are rallying support for streamlining film permits and expanding CA Film and TV tax credits through California legislation. View this post on Instagram Big films could benefit from shooting in Los Angeles as well as other productions that also tend to shoot in Atlanta, among other metropolitan cities where the film industry aims to thrive. The significance of this fast-track to install these tariffs has Hollywood’s SAG-AFTRA representative Duncan Crabtree-Ireland ready to work with the administration to make sure that American film industry folks can immediately benefit from this. âSAG-AFTRA supports efforts to increase movie, television and streaming production in the United States. We will continue to advocate for policies that strengthen our competitive position, accelerate economic growth and create good middle class jobs for American workers,” he said in a statement shared byVariety. âWe look forward to learning more about the specifics of the plan announced by the President and to advancing a dialogue to achieve our common goals.â The President’s representatives followed up the veracity of Trump’s claims by confirming, as reported by CNBC, that they’re “exploring all options,” but of course despite the strongly worded tirade, to tariff as much as the President thinks he can will be subject to examination. âAlthough no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the Administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trumpâs directive to safeguard our countryâs national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again,â spokesman Kush Desai shared on behalf of the White House, according to CNBC.

    "title": "Elon Musk Gets His Wish: OpenAI Will Remain a Nonprofit",
    "article_text": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has been working on wriggling out from under the control of the company’s nonprofit board ever since they (briefly)fired him. But, after several efforts to prevent the move, including alawsuit filed by OpenAI co-founder Elon Musk, the companyannouncedon Monday that it will keep its structure for now. The desire to ditch its nonprofit structure stems primarily from one thing: money. Being organized as a nonprofit means that OpenAI isn’t driven by providing a return on investment for shareholders (at least in theory), but instead focused on its statedmissionof ensuring âartificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.” Being a nonprofit has also led to some complications for OpenAI’s fundraising efforts. The companysecured $40 billion in funding, primarily from SoftBank, earlier this year, but that money was contingent on OpenAI completing its planned restructuring to a for-profit entity. Now that funding is in limbo. OpenAI will continue to operate a commercial subsidiary, which is the part of the company that Altman heads. But it will be transitioning from an LLC to a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), per the company. The reason for that change,some theorize, is that it will make it easier for OpenAI to eventually become publicly traded. The nonprofit board will be a primary shareholder of the PBC and will continue to oversee and control the company. The shift will also seemingly shed the capped-profit structure that the company operated with while an LLC, whichrestrictedthe return that it could pay back to investors at 100x. The attempt to restructure to a for-profit entity was met with opposition at basically every turn for OpenAI, though obviously the reasons for that pushback were not always altruistic. Musk, for instance, seemed to mostly be carrying out his lawsuit to stop the restructuring aspart of a grudgeagainst Sam Altman after the two had a falling out.Meta also fought the change, though it’s hard to imagine that’s not at least in part due to the fact that the company is creating its own ChatGPT competitor and would like to hamper OpenAI’s ability to raise money. Other nonprofits alsotook issue with OpenAI’s attempted shift, concerned that the company would use money that was supposed to be used for the “public good” to just maximize its own profits instead. Given that Altman managed tosuccessfully oust the boardthat tried to remove him forallegedly lying to themand now has othermembers in his back pocket, it’s probably fair to wonder if he’s actually making good on the nonprofit’s stated mission or if he’s just trying to maximize the bottom line with the go-ahead of a board that is more aligned with him and stands to make a lot of money one way or another.

    "title": "All the Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Horror, and Genre Movies to Care About This Summer",
    "article_text": "For movie fans, it’s themost wonderful time of the year. The summer movie season is here and with it, the promise of exciting popcorn films thatcould become future classics. Now, does that usually happen? No. Of course not. We’re lucky if each year one or two films jump out and become those certified,all-time crowd-pleasers(likeBarbieorTop Gun: Maverickin recent years). But that doesn’t stop studios from trying, or from audiences hoping, each time they buy a ticket and the lights go down. Here are all the sci-fi, fantasy, horror, and superhero movies that could be contenders this summer. Will any make the grade? You may have already seen this one as it’s currently in theaters but, we have to say, it’s a strong start to the summer. Not as epic as some of Marvel’s previous early May films, but entertaining nonetheless. Drawing inspiration from Amblin films of the 1980s, this Swedish film is about a young woman who teams up with some UFO nuts to try and find her missing father, who she believes was abducted by aliens. The title pretty much says it all, does it not? As you can already tell, horror is big this summer and maybe the biggest out of those is the sixth film in theFinal Destinationseries. This time, the idea of death following a group of unintended survivors gets taken up a notch as it trickles down to an entire family. We’ve seen it, and can assure you it’s a gruesome, hilarious blast. Popular musician the Weeknd stars in, came up with the story for, and did the music in this mysterious, trippy thriller co-starring Jenna Ortega and Barry Keoghan. Hayden Panettiere co-stars in this indie about a group of influencers invited to an island, who then have to survive and hunt man-eating dogs, or get eaten themselves. One of Disney’s most popular modern animated films joins its growing list of live-action remakes. However, unlike this year’s earlier release, Snow White, audiences seem extremely excited for this one. We expect it to be one of the biggest hits of the summer. Picking up the story from 2023’s “Dead Reckoning,” Tom Cruise returns as secret agent Ethan Hunt in what may be his finalMissionfilm. Expect big stunts, big stakes, and a story that brings all of the other films in the franchise together. The latest film in Netflix’s series of R.L. Stine adaptations,Prom Queenfollows a young woman who decides to go up against the popular girls trying to win the crown. But then, those girls all start disappearing. Taking place after the events ofCobra Kai,but not an official sequel, Jackie Chan and Ralph Macchio star as two senseis who work together to train a new Karate Kid. Will this live up to the original trilogy of films or the hit Netflix show? We’ll find out soon. The directorial team behind the hitTalk to Me,Danny Philippou and Michael Philippou, are back with another new horror film. This one features Sally Hawkins leading a house where, we think, she resurrects dead children? We aren’t quite sure, but we can’t wait to find out. Yes, Kevin Smith’s 26-year-old (they missed the 25th anniversary) film is coming back to 1,500 screens this summer. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon play angels who attempt to disprove the word of God. It’s a weird, dated movie, but still lots of fun. Yes, your favorite anime is coming to the big screen for a limited event. It will “screen last seasonâs start of the ‘Evil Eye’ arc, along with the first three episodes of the new second season, in addition to an exclusive interview with series co-directors Fuga Yamashiro and Abel Gongora.” Officially titledFrom the World of John Wick: Ballerina, the film follows another killer assassinâthis time played by Ana de Armasâon her journey through Wick’s world. The action looks right on par with the previous films, and Keanu Reeves himself even makes a cameo. Who doesn’t love a good exorcism movie? Especially one that starsâand this is realâAl Pacino! It’s based on a true story and co-stars Dan Stevens too! The latest, and maybe weirdest yet, movie from Wes Anderson follows a wealthy man (Benicio del Toro) travels the world setting his affairs in order as he prepares to leave his fortune to his estranged daughter. It co-stars Michael Cera, Tom Hanks, Bryan Cranston, Benedict Cumberbatch, and many, many, many more. Based on the Stephen King story of the same name, Tom Hiddleston and multiple other actors play a man named Chuck in the story of one man’s life told backwards. Frequent King collaborator and fan Mike Flanagan directs, and after winning some big film festival awards, we expect it to be something special. Sometimes the official description does all the heavy lifting. “When Zephyr, a rebellious surfer, is abducted by a shark-obsessed serial killer and held captive on his boat, she must figure out how to escape before he carries out a ritualistic feeding to the sharks below.” Yup. In. Not a shot-by-shot remake, but close at times, this live-action film aims to recapture the magic of its 2010 animated original. And, guess what? It does exactly that. If you love the story of Hiccup, Toothless, and the Berk crew, you are going to love seeing them in a whole new way. Oscar-winning director Danny Boyle returns to one of the franchises he helped bring to prominence with this first film in a planned trilogy taking place, you guessed it, 28 years after the original. Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Jodie Comer, and Ralph Fiennes star in the new zombie tale. A new original film from Pixar centers on a young boy who travels to space as the mistaken representative of the planet Earth. Fingers crossed it can live up to its Pixar legacy. The bitch is back. Literally. After a new AI based on M3GAN threatens to really mess things up, the killer doll AI is brought back to life with a bunch of new upgrades. If it’s half as wacky as the original, we’re in for a real treat. The first trilogy is over. The second trilogy has, mercifully, concluded. So what’s next for the world ofJurassic Park? Well, it’s the seventh film in the series, starting a whole new tale focused on characters played by Scarlett Johansson, Jonathan Bailey, Mahershala Ali, and others. Gareth Edwards, director ofRogue OneandGodzilla, is at the helm. It all comes down to this. Though James Gunn’s take onSupermanis literally the first film in a whole new DC Universe, it feels like it has the weight of the world on it. The expectations are insane but, if any character can take those on, it’s the Man of Steel. We have high, high hopes. Look. If you live in Southport, North Carolina, and you and your friends accidentally kill someone, please own up to it. Maybe if that happened, there wouldn’t be so many more brutal killings in the aftermath. It happened in 1997 and now it’s happening again, blending the cast of the original film (Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr.) with a brand new generation. Much likeSupermankicks off a new era for DC,Fantastic Fourstarts a new era at Marvel. The first family of the brand is finally part of the cinematic universe and we expect them to play a very, very big role moving ahead. So, hopefully, this first film will make us want to see Mr. Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Thing, and Human Torch again and again. This isn’t technically a genre film (though no one can really hit a golf ball like that) but we are just so excited to see Adam Sandler back in one of his most iconic roles, and with the whole gang back together too. Real-life married couple Dave Franco and Alison Brie play a couple who encounter a supernatural force that begins to fuse their bodies together. Literally. It looks absolutely bonkers. Summers are usually overflowing with major animated films but, this year, that’s not the case. You’ve gotElioand you’ve got this sequel to the hit 2022 film about bunch of villains who team up for a heist. This time, the bad “guys” meet their match when they run into the bad “girls.” While there’s plenty of humor this summer, there isn’t a lot of comedy, especially in theaters. The biggest exception is this reimagining/sequel to the classic 1990s franchise, this time featuring Liam Neeson and Pamela Anderson. It looks utterly ridiculous, and we can’t wait. This body-swapping sequel to the 2003 remake brings back the mother-daughter team of Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan, and makes this freakier by adding in another, younger generation. The film will surely be a nice, late summer blend of family-friendly humor and nostalgia. WithBarbarian, director Zach Cregger set a high bar for himself. One that says he makes original horror movies with huge concepts and lots of twists. And, he seems to have lived up to that withWeapons, his sophomore film which stars Julia Garner and Josh Brolin. It tells the tale of what happens when a single classroom of students mysteriously disappears. The firstNobodywas one of the biggest surprises to come out during the pandemic and so it rightfully got a sequel. Now we get to see the full, theatrical might of Bob Odenkirk kicking ass when someone does wrong by his family. Which is the plot this second time around. Director Chuck Russell made cult classics likeA Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors, Eraser,andThe Mask; he’s back with a new film in that same tone. It’s about a witch who is mistakenly released and wreaks havoc in New Orleans. This is kind of a cheat but we figured it was worth mentioning anyway. Starting this summer, one of the best movies of all time,The Wizard of Oz, will become the first Hollywood film to play in the Sphere in Las Vegas. You thought IMAX was big? It’s got nothing on this. It should be insanely epic. What better way to end the summer with a super disgusting, offensive remake of one of Troma’s finest creations? Peter Dinklage stars as the titular hero, who kills people with a radioactive mop after being thrown into toxic waste by his evil boss, played by Kevin Bacon. Based on a short story by Joe Hill,Abraham’s Boysfollows two boys who soon realize their father (named, you guessed it, Abraham) has a mysterious history with Dracula.

    "title": "Google Is Getting Into the Movie Business to Produce Pro-Tech Propaganda",
    "article_text": "Big tech has a big public opinion problem. Years of political controversy and privacy invasions have left people feeling hostile toward the industry, no matter what side of the aisle they fall on. Maybe a little boost from Tinseltown would help? That seems to be what Google’s thinking as it has struck up aÂ multi-year partnership with Range Media Partners (producers of âLonglegsâ and âA Complete Unknownâ) on a new film and TV production venture called 100 Zeros. The initiative is tasked with finding scripted and unscripted projects for Google to help fund or produce. Business Insiderreportsthat Googleâs ultimate aim is to encourage creatives to adopt its new technologies, like its Immersive View feature, which lets users see things in 3D in Maps; spatial tools that blend the real and virtual worlds; and AI.Â More significantly, the company is also hoping to promote positive opinions of its products, especially among young people, by creating its own pieces of entertainment and popular culture. To this end, 100 Zeros quietly contributed some marketing dollars to Neonâs âCuckoo,â an indie horror film starring Hunter Schaefer, last year. 100 Zerosâs logo was featured on-screen during the movie’s opening credits, but Google sought no publicity for the spend.Â In April, Google announced another project with Range: âAI on Film,â a program tocommission short filmsthat explore the relationship between humanity and AI.The companies committed to spending the next 18 months developing, financing, and producing these shorts, with the ultimate goal of greenlighting two into feature-length adaptations.Â At the time, Mira Lane, then the Sr. Director of Technology and Society at Google, explained the venture toVariety, saying, â…as AI moves out of the realm of science fiction and into our everyday lives, narrative films present an opportunity to explore and showcase the ways we want to coexist with this technology.â According to LinkedIn, Lane has since been promoted to VP of technology and society at Google, and her work is focused on the way the company can âcombat a deluge of dystopian narrativesâ brought on by the development of intelligence.Â Talent firm and production company Range Media was founded in 2022 by Peter Micelli and Jack Whigham, two veterans of powerhouse agency CAA. Rangeâs roster of clients includes director Michael Bay, actor Bradley Cooper, and athlete and content creator Ilona Maher.Â Notably, CAA filed suit against Range Media in 2024, accusing the company of stealing confidential information from CAA via its assistants and other employees it was in the process of poaching. (Thisis a movie I would watch!) It also alleges that Range Media skirts California law and Writers Guild of America requirements by acting as a talent agency, but calling itself a management company. In doing so, CAA claims that the company can profit from transactions not available to âlaw-abiding talent agencies.â In January, Range Media won a pause in litigation.

You’ll find Rey and Chewie by theMillennium Falconencouraging you to to stand against Kylo Ren and the First Order which sets up the video’s final note of evil Ben Solo encouraging you to “turn against the light.” Also featured in the video arethe Mandalorian and Grogu, driving the point thatthere is no longer a fixed timeline at Galaxy’s Edgeand you never know who you’ll meet along the way. Also added onto Disney Plus is a full POV ofRise of the Resistance, the E-ticket attraction at Galaxy’s Edge. And yes Oscar Issac’s Poe Dameron makes an appearance to call you a “fine looking” recruit, and since you’re the only one in the room you know he means it. The details of the queue are passed over a little quickly but you get to see more of the resistance base details here than you do on the ride. It’s fun and once you hop onto the ride vehicle it’s great to be in the action and ride along. Pull up a rolling office chair and you can add some 4D thrills at home.

    "title": "Isabela Merced Reflects on Dina and Ellie’s Last of Us Romance",
    "article_text": "Season twoofThe Last of Ushas already endureda significant tragedyâbut in the wake of terrible loss, a new love has blossomed between Dina (Isabela Merced) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey).This week’s episodesaw the two characters take their romance to a new level amid a long-haul revenge mission, and Merced (Madame Web,Alien: Romulus, this summer’sSuperman) spoke about the deep connection that’s building between the women. Speaking toVariety, Merced explained that the two are helping each other get through all the trauma they’ve experiencedâand continue to experience living inThe Last of Us‘ dangerous world. “Ellieâs really fucked up and angry, but whenever Dinaâs around, itâs like she suddenly is able to access the joy that she once felt,” Merced explained. “I also think Dinaâs helping Ellie grieve in a wayâbut also Ellieâs helpingDinagrieve. I think Dinaâs redirecting her grief and putting it on Ellie and being like, ‘Oh, Iâll help you.'” She said she appreciated the romance is “slow burn,” in contrast toThe Last of Usgame, but she was glad the HBO show did keep the “Take on Me” scene from the source material. “I was excited to shoot it, and then I was also really emotional, because of the set design being so beautiful and it feeling a really truly sweet and tender moment in the show after so much darkness and loss. So I was very emotional that day,” Merced explained. She continued. “I noticed when watching it recently that there was a switch from the loving look to a sadness in my eyes. I was trying to remember what I was thinking, and I think it was just like I wanted to incorporate that Dina isnât fearless, really? She may seem like it. She may seem like she can handle a lot, and throughout the episode you learn that she canât. But I wanted to give people a glimpse into that, because love is scary. So for her to feel these emotions, and then in real time be scared of them, was really important to me. Because I think thatâs realistic.” Speaking tothe Hollywood Reporter, Merced reflected on what it was like filming the first sex scene between Ellie and Dina. “This is a really necessary step in their relationship. Itâs also just like really hot to me because itâs like the culmination of all of these feelings and secrets all just being let out in one moment,” she said. The scene feels spontaneous, but that’s not how it was behind the scenes, Merced said. “It may seem passionate and in-the-moment, but it was really calculated, and we were really intentional about every single thing that was a part of that sequence, because we wanted to make sure none of the characters were doing anything that was out of character.” New episodes ofThe Last of Ushit HBO and Max on Sundays.

    "title": "Europe Unveils $565 Million Plan to Attract Scientists From U.S. as Trump Defunds Basic Research",
    "article_text": "European leaders unveiled a new initiative Monday to entice U.S. scientists to bring their expertise across the Atlantic. They’re calling it “Choose Europe for Science,” and it will allocate â¬500 million ($565 million U.S.) over the next three years to “make Europe a magnet for researchers” from around the world. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and French President Emmanuel Macron spoke at Sorbonne University in France to announce the effort Monday. And while neither mentioned President Donald Trump by name, his government’s destruction of scientific research funding in the U.S. was clearly the impetus for all of it. âWe must not downplay what is at stake today. No one could have imagined a few years ago that one of the world’s largest democracies would abolish research programs on the grounds that there was the word ‘diversity’ in their programs,â Macron said, according to anEnglish translation. Trump has launched a war against what he calls DEI efforts, which has meant that even the mention of terms like “transgender” or “LGBT” have been purged frompublic health websites. High-ranking and well-qualified officials who are not white men have also beenshown the door.And while the White House insists it’s all about “restoring” meritocracy to the U.S., its real purpose is to resegregate American society, starting with the military and federal agencies. The White House has absolutely decimated scientific research in the U.S. within just three short months.The Trump regime has terminatedbillions of dollarsin research grants at the Department of Health and Human Services as well as theNational Science Foundation. But it’s not just the money that Trump is unilaterally pulling that experts are concerned about. Trump has also asked for dramatic cuts in his budget proposal to make further cuts of nearly 50% atNIH and CDCwith the help of Congress. The cuts are expected to significantlyset backscientific research in the U.S. by not just years but generations. And Europeans are betting that scientists who want to continue their work may look overseas. Macron talked Monday about how important science is to liberal democracies, making a reference to a recent incident in the U.S. âNo one could have imagined that one of the world’s greatest democracies could, in one fell swoop, strike out the possibility of obtaining a visa for a researcher,â Macron said, referring to a French researcher who was denied entry into the U.S. over private text messagescriticizing Trump. The EU’s von der Leyen made similar verbal gestures to the U.S. without uttering Trump’s name and the country’s descent into fascism. “Unfortunately, as your discussions have shown today, the role of science in today’s world is questioned,” von der Leyensaid. “The investment in fundamental, free and open research is questioned. What a gigantic miscalculation. I believe that science holds the key to our future here in Europe.” The $565 million announced Monday for the “Choose Europe for Science” effort will be added to the European Research Council, which von der Leyen noted “is run not by politicians, but by scientists, for scientists.” She also told the story of Marie Curie, who fled Poland in the late 19th century, then part of the Russian Empire, and landed in Sorbonne, France. It was in France that she was able to become the Nobel Prize-winning scientist the world knows her as today. “I start with this story, not just because we are here at the Sorbonne, or even because it shows how scientific excellence can change the course of destiny, but because this is also a story of freedom,” said von der Leyen. “Freedom to learn and invent. It is a story about openness, openness to turn ideas into groundbreaking discoveries. And it is a story about collaboration beyond borders. The EU leader emphasized that freedom and openness “is exactly what Europe and the world now needs more than ever,” adding, “I’m convinced that science remains the fuel of progress and growth for our societies.” There are obviously historical parallels to what’s happening in the U.S. right now. When fascists took power in Europe during the 1930s, many scientists fled to other countries like the UK, Denmark, and the United States. Italian physicistBruno Rossifled Italy in 1938 and landed in the U.S. where he developed radar technology at MIT before working with the Manhattan Project during World War II. And the ascension of the Nazis in Germany caused countless scientists to flee, including Albert Einstein who left in 1932 just before Adolf Hitler took power. A letter found decades later revealed Einstein had a bad feeling about the Nazis asearly as 1922, long before Hitler had captured government. Speaking about the effort to attract scientists from around the world on Monday, von der Leyen didn’t just pat Europe on the back. She acknowledged what she said were regulatory barriers for businesses that wanted to invest in the continent to lead in technological innovation and commercial opportunities. “This is why we will put forward a first-ever European Innovation Act and a Startup and Scaleup Strategy, to remove regulatory and other barriers, and to facilitate access to venture capital for innovative European startups and scaleups,” saidvon der Leyen. Traditional liberal values are driving the outreach by European officials, who want the good guys to ultimately win. Trump and his goons are clearly not the good guys, as anyone who’s studied the history of fascism can see. And while moving halfway around the world is a dramatic thing to do, there are plenty of people who have historically decided to do just that before it was too late. “We can all agree that science has no passport, no gender, no ethnicity or political party,” von der Leyen said. “And as such, it does play a crucial role in connecting people and creating a shared future in today’s fractured world. We believe that diversity is an asset of humanity and the lifeblood of science. It is one of the most valuable global goods, and it must be protected.” Donald TrumpEmmanuel MacronEUEuropean UnionfascismUrsula von der Leyen Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Laura Loomer Flexes Her Influence to Take Down Trump’s Surgeon General Nominee",
    "article_text": "Somehow, Laura Loomer has more staying power with the Trump White House than she did when she literallyhandcuffed herself to Twitter’s doors. The far-right conspiracy theorist, fresh off of reportedly using her influence to force National Security Adviser Mike Waltz out of the administration, is trying to throw her weight around to oust Trump’s Surgeon General Nominee, Janette Nesheiwat, for not being sufficiently anti-vaccine,per The Daily Beast. Loomer has taken aim at Nesheiwat over her support for the covid-19 vaccine, taking issue with her support for the shot thatsaved an estimated 2.4 million livesand for calling vaccine hesitancy a âglobal health threat.â Loomer, whoclaimswithout any evidence or hint that she has even a single toe still touching reality that the Covid vaccine is “now killing millions of people,”saidthat Nesheiwat is ânot being ideologically aligned with Donald Trump or his adminâs health initiatives.â She also called Nesheiwat a “a pro-COVID vaccine nepo appointee” and called for Trump to ditch her in favor of a nominee “more aligned with personal liberties.” Now, Loomer may be right about one thing: Nesheiwat probably should be replaced as the pick for Surgeon General. But that has less to do with her position on vaccines, which seem pretty reasonable when compared to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy’s recent claims that the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella vaccinecontains âfetus debris,âand more to do with the fact that she seems to have fabricated parts of her background. Last month, independent journalist Anthony Clarkbroke the storythat Nesheiwat has, for years, claimed to have received her MD from the University of Arkansas Medical Sciences when she did not actually attend the school.Per Clark’s reporting, Nesheiwat completed a family medicine residency at a regional campus associated with the school. Her degree is from the American University of the Caribbean, a for-profit school that, at the time Nesheiwat would have attended, was likelyprimarily attendedby students rejected for admission by traditional medical schools. Loomer is on something of a “right for the wrong reasons” streak lately. In addition to opposing Nesheiwat not for her fudged credentials but instead for her pro-vaccine positions, Loomer also recentlytook credit for the oustingof Trump National Security Advisor Mike Waltzânot because headded a journalist to a Signal group chatwhere war plans were being shared, but because his deputy, Alex Wong, is the son of Chinese immigrants andshe believedhe was advancing Chinese interests over America. The fact that Loomerâa9/11 trutherwho hasoutwardly supported the creation of a white ethnostateand has views so extreme that Marjorie Taylor Greene of all people hascalled her“mentally unstable and a documented liar”âhas any voice within the White House is troubling. The fact that she seems to have a particularly loud one that also happens to land directly on the President’s ear likely means the madness won’t stop any time soon.

    "title": "Doctor Who‘s Disinformation Episode Needed a Bit More Bite",
    "article_text": "Lots of things can be terrifying onDoctor Who.Monsters, of course, are terrifying. Standing the face of the unknown in a vast, undiscovered universe is also pretty terrifying. Our noble heropushed to dark impulses, a terror in a more cerebral way. But sometimes, the most terrifying thing of all can just be a guy who really, really,reallysucks. That Guy Who Sucks is Conrad Clark (played by Jonah Hauer-King, who does a brilliant job saturating Conrad with the most absolutely rancid vibes even before you get to his mid-episode “twist”). At first, “Lucky Day” introduces us to Conrad like manyDoctor Whosupporting characters before him: we get a brief whimsical encounter in 2007 where he sees the Doctor, Belinda, and the TARDIS, sparking a lifelong obsession with the alien and the unknown that eventually leads to him crossing paths with Ruby after he also witnesses her and the Doctor encounter a hunter-predator alien called the Shreek. What first begins as an awkward podcast interview becomes a slightly-less-awkward date, which then becomes several, and suddenly Ruby’s post-Doctor life is looking nice and bright. She’s got a new man, a happy family, and a cushy job at thechild-labor-and-ex-companion-factorythat is UNIT. Things first take a dark turn when Ruby and Conrad go on a countryside getaway together, only to discover that the Shreek have seemingly returned. Conrad has had a bit of a weird vibe to him at this point in the episode, but mostly in a “slightly annoying but otherwise harmless” way, until he reveals to Ruby that he randomly decided to not take the anti-Shreek antidote she’d given him to protect him. And then, the vibe makes the aforementioned rancid turn when Ruby calls UNIT in to protect Conrad and his friends from the Shreek… and it turns out the whole thing is a hoax. There are no new Shreek, it’s Connor’s friends (in surprisingly good prosthetics for random weirdos!), and it turns out they’re all part of a conspiracy theory group called Think Tank that is trying to expose UNIT as peddling disinformation and simply saying that aliens are real to control the population. This is where “Lucky Day” gets simultaneously very interesting, and very dangerous if you begin thinking about it for more than five minutes. Again, it cannot be stated enough what a good job Hauer-King does of making Conrad feelÂincrediblyhateful once the mask falls off, even if it is slightly weird that suddenly we getDoctor Who‘s secondtoxic boyfriend storylineof the season. PlusÂ the prospect ofDoctor Whofinding its own way into a timely conversation about right-wing radicalization and misinformation campaignsâextrapolated through the reality that, 20 years into its modern run, we’ve just had to kind of accept a broad public awareness that monsters and aliens are a reality of the worldâis brilliant, and the exact kind of thing the show can and should do at its very best. Things get even better ironically as things get worse and worse for Ruby: Connor and Think Tank’s campaign keeps ramping up, UNIT comes increasingly under fire from a suddenly skeptical public, and even really on the verge of implosion, it seems, with double-agents leaking information and Conrad’s goons doxxing every employee to the wider world, putting a huge amount of pressure on Kate. That pressure reaches its climax when Connor stages a one-man infiltration of UNIT’s latest HQ, holding Ruby, Kate, and the command team hostage (including returning faces like Ruth Madeley’s analyst Shirley and Alexander Devrient’s handsome Chief of Security Colonel Ibrahim, who seems to now be in a relationship with Kate? Good for her!) in an attempt to expose them once and for all. But then Conrad makes a terrible mistake: on the verge of victory for his cause, he disses the Brigadier, as if we weren’t already expected to hate him enough, and Kate snaps. We know it’s bad, but also, as we’ve said already, Connor is an quantifiably awful person, so there’s equal joy and terror in watching Kate cross the line and set the real Shreek out to not just scare Connor into compliance, but, until everyone else steps in to convince her otherwise, essentially attempt to execute him for what he’s done. Doctor Wholoves giving us a villain to hate, but rarely does it allow its heroes to actually hate them in turn, so watching Kate willingly go as far as she does is a boldness the show rarely allows itself. And even when the situation is diffusedâin spite of herself, Ruby saves Connor from the Shreek, and even though it does chomp on him a little, he gets taken to hospital and then directly to prison, his live-streamed stunt this time re-shifting public opinion back in UNIT’s favorâit’s clear there’s going to be consequences going forward for Kate and UNIT alike. These consequences will no doubt manifest if not by the end of this season (we know we’re back with UNIT at some point in the next four episodes), then presumably by the upcoming UNIT-focused-spinoffWar Between Land and Sea. It’s here that things start getting a bit more complicated. While “Lucky Day” is full-throated in its presentation of Conrad and Think Tank as not just wrong, but downright villainous, its alternative once they’re foiled leans much more in the line of vindicating UNIT. Of course, welikeUNIT, we’reÂDoctor Whofans. We know they help our hero save the day all the time. But UNIT, especially in the current era’s vision of the organization, is likewise not a flawless entity. In the name of safeguarding the world, we’ve seen them enacting far-reaching surveillance and monitoring of the public; we’ve seen them detain and arrest journalists to cover up operations. I joked earlier, but Katehasrecruited multiple children onto staff! Children who now apparently got doxxed by this creep! As cathartic as it is to watch Kate go postal on Conrad, this is still the head of a government-backed organization attempting to extrajudicially murder someone while they’re livestreaming to hundreds of thousands of people. A guy who isincredibly dislikable, sure, but still! It’s all well and good that Ibrahim tells Kate there will be consequences for her actions down the line, but in the moment, “Lucky Day” only offers trust and absolution of UNIT as an alternative to Conrad’s misguided conspiraciesâand even if thereareconsequences later, will they survive the next time UNIT helps the Doctor save the day? It’s good thatDoctor Whois willing to play with the mess of moral compromises that it does here, especially in the name of using it to comment on real-world issues. But taking those complicated ideas and filing them down into an either-or scenario that falls apart once you think about it beyond the moment of the episode, and robs that decision to play with something more nuanced and darkly toned of its effectiveness in the here and now, punting the resolution down the line to either be handwaved or absolved at a later date. “Lucky Day” even manages to speed-run a condensed version of this compromised vision in its very closing moments. Rotting in jail as he recovers from his bite wound, Conrad finds himself suddenly whisked into the TARDIS console room for an absolute dressing down from the Doctor. Again, in the moment, this isbrilliant. It’sÂDoctor Whotrading in any and all subtlety or layers of commentary to essentially have Ncuti Gatwa turn to camera and rage in equal parts against the show’s detractors and the disinformation industrial complex at large. And even better, it gives Gatwa’s Time Lord a chance to have a real element of darkness to him: he’s not here, as Conrad mocks, to try and absolve him, he’s here to tell him he sucks, he hates him, and even that the Doctor knows exactly what the rest of his miserable life is going to entail, including his untimely death, alone, imprisoned, and forgotten. The Doctor saves people, that’s what they do, but sometimes there are people who can’t be saved from themselves. If this was where “Lucky Day” actually ended, then its mixed handling of the whole UNIT thing might be more excusableâexchanging a lack of bite there to give its titular hero a deliciously compromised character beat. Except, it doesn’t. The Doctor dumps Conrad back in the prison where he will, apparently, eventually meet his end… only for Mrs. Flood, now a conveniently placed prison governor, to come to the door of his cell and let him escape, knowingly raise her eyebrow at the audience. We can’t even be allowed the knowledge that this guy, the guy the almostentire episodehas been dedicated screaming about how terrible he is, gets to suffer for what he did! Again, maybe it’ll come up at some point again whenever the Mrs. Flood stuff pays off (maybe she’s recruiting the Asshole Avengers for the finale?), but in the moment, it robsÂthisparticular story of taking a stance on the complicated scenarios it wants to play with.ÂDoctor Whocan, and should, use its voice to comment on very real issues our world faces, even if it is extrapolated through the lens of its surreal world of adventures in time and space. But if it’s going to, it should be full-throated when it does, instead of standing on the edge of saying something andthen backing down. Doctor Whocan be brave in the face of fictional monsters, it should be brave in the face of real ones, too. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Apple’s Super-Skinny iPhone 17 Air Might Have a Huge Downside",
    "article_text": "Asuper-thin iPhone 17 “Air”(as everyone has been calling it) is coming this fall whether we want it or not. Influencers will fawn over its slim profile; I will definitely try to cut cake with it. But phones barely thicker than a USB-C port will likely nix the creature comforts that we’re all used to on our normal-sized slabs. In addition to reporting that Apple is planning to shuffle up its iPhone release strategy starting next yearâpremium iPhones including the 18 Pros, 18 Air, and a foldable iPhone in the fall, and more affordable models like the iPhone 18 and iPhone 18e in the springâThe Information claimsthis fall’s iPhone 17 Air will have shorter battery life compared to theiPhone 17and17 Pros. “The percentage of users who can go a single day without recharging the thin phone will be between 60% and 70%,” the report states. “For other models, that metric is between 80% and 90%, one of the people said.” Naturally, a thinner phone requires a slimmer battery that can fit inside of the iPhone 17 Air’s metal chassis. There are other ways Apple could compensate for a smaller battery, such as using efficient chips, but that may not be the case for this first-gen iPhone Air. Instead, Apple is reportedly planning to sell a battery case that users can attach to extend the time between charges. The cynic will say this is classic Apple creating a problem to sell an accessory as a solution. Of course, idealists will defend the thinness and tell you to just buy a regular iPhone or Pro model if having the longest battery life is at the top of your checklist. Apple has pitched an accessory before to make up for reduced battery life; alongside theiPhone 12,Apple sold a MagSafe Battery Pack. Apple will never say outright why it sold a battery case, but it’s almost certainly because the iPhone 12s, which were the first to include power-hungry 5G modems, couldn’t last a full work day. Applediscontinued the MagSafe Battery Packseveral years later. Was it a coincidence that that happened as iPhones got thicker and battery life longer? Or did Apple stop production because it didn’t want to swap out the accessory’s Lightning port for a USB-C one after theEU forced it to switch to the universal port? I’m sure there are Redditors ready to cry conspiracy. Reduced battery life on the iPhone 17 Air will lead headlines, but that’s not the only downgrade. We already know this phone will have a single rear cameraâone that juts out quite a bit. The Information also reports that the thin iPhone will have a single speaker instead of the dual speakers in the other iPhone 17s. None of this is news that will go down well with consumers come this fall, but getting a battery pack is the reality that you’ll have to accept if you want Apple’s thinnest iPhone ever.YouTuber Sam Kohl shared a videoshowcasing high-quality dummy models for the new iPhone 17 and 17 Pros, as well as the iPhone 17 Airâand yeah, the skinny one is absurdly thin. The ultra-thin iPhone 17 is happening. There’s already too much smoke. Worse will be the added cost to what is shaping up to be a costly iPhone.Rumors suggestthe iPhone 17 Air could start at $900 or more. Apple has a tendency to charge extra for thin bragging rights. We’ve still got an entire summer to get through before we know how much an iPhone 17 Air and a battery pack will cost. We also don’t know whether any ofTrump’s tariffswill drive that price into the stratosphere. Better brace yourself now, though, so the shock doesn’t stun too hard when Apple throws the price slide up on screen at Apple Park.

    "title": "Musk Got His Company Town—Starbase City Is Official",
    "article_text": "Itâs official: SpaceX has its own company town on the southern tip of Texas despite concerns that it would expand the companyâs control of the area. Residents living near SpaceXâs launch site, the majority of whom are company employees,voted in favor of turning Starbase into its own city. It was a sweeping win for SpaceX, with 212 voting in favor of the rocket city and six against, according to the Cameron County Elections Department. SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk has long dreamed of turning Starbase into its own city, and the billionaire celebrated on X byannouncing, âNow, it is official.â Muskfirst pitched the idea of a Starbase city in 2021, and the company has since expanded its presence with housing and other facilities. A report issued by TreviÃ±oâs office in June stated that more than 3,400 SpaceX employees and contractors have set up shop around the base in the past few years. Earlier last year, SpaceX alsoannounced plansto open a $15 million shopping center and restaurant. In December 2024,more than 70 county residents submitted a petitionto request an election regarding the decision to make Starbase its own municipality. Most of the residents, however, are believed to be SpaceX employees,accordingto the petition obtained by AP. The city spans about 1.6 square miles (3.9 square kilometers) and is home to roughly 500 nearby residents, according to theBBC. SpaceX began buying land in the area in 2012, when the company wasnât nearly as influential as it is today. Starbase will have its own mayor, Bobby Peden, SpaceXâs vice president, and two commissioners. It is designated as a Type-C city, a municipality with less than 5,000 residents. SpaceXâs rocket launches have already been disruptive to the local community, and the establishment of Starbase as a city may increase the companyâs municipal authority and allow it to overstep regulatory red tape designed to protect its surrounding environment. In July 2024, the Center for Biological Diversity, American Bird Conservancy, and other conservation groupsfiled a lawsuit against the Federal Aviation Administration, alleging that it rushedSpaceXâs Starship permittingprocess without adequate environmental review or mitigation requirements. SpaceX is also facing fines of almost $150,000 from the Environmental Protection Agency for allegedly illegally dumping pollutants into a Texas waterway without a permit. SpaceX could alsohave control over highway and beach closures in the area. Texas lawmakers filed a bill on March 14 that would grant SpaceX control over road and beach closures for its rocket activities. Although the bill, filed by two Republican senators, does not mention SpaceX by name, it refers to counties with spaceports and beach access âbordering on the Gulf of Mexico or its tidewater limits.â Local officials are generally in favor of SpaceX for generating jobs in the area and drawing spectators for its rocket launches, but the companyâs investment in southern Texas may come at a price.

    "title": "Thunderbolts Gives the MCU Its New Avengers, Now What?",
    "article_text": "Since the asterisk was revealed to be a prominent part ofÂThunderbolts’Âtitle, fans have wondered what it meant. At first, it seemed to indicate thefuture team’sdispleasure with the name Red Guardian christens them with. That’s very much the case in the film, but there’s also more to it than that, which you’ve probably already seen online thanks to fans andMarvel itself. (A source close to the project told io9 that the reveal is not intended to be permanent, just a marketing maneuver to pay off the asterisk.) After saving Bob from the all-powerful Void within him, the team spot Val, the woman responsible for New York’s recent chaos. They walk over to apprehend or kill her, but it’s a feint: they’ve stepped into the sight line of press Val summoned so she could announce them as the new Avengersâfurther emphasized during the end titles, which transitions fromThunderboltsÂtoÂNew Avengers,Âcomplete with a new logo and Alan Silvestri’s theme. Who are the New Avengers? Created in January 2005 by Brian Michael Bendis and David Finch, the team was formed in the aftermath of 2004’sÂAvengers DisassembledÂstoryline when Electro attacks the supervillain prison the Raft. Spider-Woman, Daredevil, and Luke Cage, already onsite, team up with Captain America, Iron Man, Sentry, and Spider-Man to stop the riot. Forty-two inmates escape, prompting the heroesâsans Daredevil and Sentryâto form a new team and track the missing villains, with Wolverine joining shortly after. The New Avengers were a premier team during the mid-2000s, lasting through the Scarlet Witch and Magneto’s House of M, the superhero Civil War, the Skrulls’ invasion of Earth, and the rise of the Dark Avengers. There’ve been a few iterations of the New Avengers since Bendis and Finch’s initial version, andÂThunderbolts’Âcast were all part of either team (or both) at some point in their individual comics histories. Bob/Sentry, Bucky, and Val’s assistant Melâaka Songbirdâhave been New Avengers during its handful of runs, while Yelena, Red Guardian, US Agent, Ghost, and Taskmaster were on the Thunderbolts at least twice. Whereas the first New Avengers in the comics just generally happened to assemble, the Thunderbolts have typically been brought together for a specifc purpose. (One of its most recent incarnations, for example, came together to kill the Red Skull.) The movie does a little of both: Val summons Walker, Yelena, Ghost, and Taskmaster to her compound so they can kill each other and tie up her loose ends, then stick together to save Bob from her clutches and being groomed into the Sentry. In pretending to be superheroes, these Thunderbolts somewhat resemble the comics group’s core concepts of villains playing at being good to pull off crimes, then reformed villains redeeming themselves through heroics. What purpose do the New Avengers have in the MCU? Val mentions a few times in the film the need for a new superhero team to protect America, though by the time of the post-credits scene, they seem to have lost public favor and are in the middle of a trademark war with current Captain America Sam Wilson. Sam doesn’t make an appearance, but he apparently has his own team of Avengers, which currently appears to just include his protege Joaquin Torres as the new Falcon. But those discussions will have to wait, because they’re seemingly the first to be aware of a rocket potentially containing the Fantastic Four coming to Earth, paving the way for both teams’ inclusion inAvengers: Doomsday. BothDoomsdayand its sequelSecret WarsÂ look to be incorporating threads from Jonathan Hickman and Esad Ribic’s 2015multiverse-focused event. The New Avengers had a part to play in that, too: the relaunched book in 2013 from Hickman, Steve Epting, and Mike Deodato was actually about theIlluminati, who were devoted to stopping multiversal Incurions. (Reed Richards, Beast, Professor X, and Namor have been members of that team, and they’re all appearing inDoomsday.) During the “Time Runs Out” storyline building up toSecret Wars, then-Avengers member Sunspot created his own team of New Avengers to deal with that threat, plus end quash the war between the core Avengers team and Illuminati. After the reborn Marvel universe post-Secret Wars,the New Avengers were rebranded into the U.S. Avengers in a 2017-2018 run from Al Ewing and Paco Medina, and haven’t been seen since. But in Val’s insistence on an America-focused team, the movie appears to have the spirit of that offshoot team in its DNA. Where the cinematic New Avengers go fromDoomsdayand on will be seen throughout the years. For now, Val has the team she promised the people, and the New Avengers have the second shot their members have been hoping forâplus leverage on Val if she ever reneges on them. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Signalgate: Modified Signal App Used by Former National Security Advisor Was Hacked",
    "article_text": "Last Wednesday, former national security advisor Mike Waltz was photographed at a cabinet meeting using TeleMessage, a modified version of Signal, the encrypted messaging app that has been the source of much ire for the Trump administration. TeleMessage’s key modification to Signal (and other end-to-end encrypted messaging apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, and WeChat) is that it archives messages, putting it in compliance with data retention laws for federal employees. But just because it supports compliance, doesnât mean itâs secure. After receiving a wave of media coverage last week, TeleMessage was hacked, 404 Mediareported on Sunday.The hacker told 404 that he was able to breach and steal customer data âin 15 to 20 minutes,” including messages sent via the appâs Signal clone. The data includes message contents, the names and contact information of government officials, and TeleMessage usernames and password data. While Mike Waltzâs messages were reportedly not breached, US Customs and Border Protection, Coinbase, and Democratic legislators were reportedly compromised.Â Some of the stolen messages were particularly timely. A chat called GD Crypto (apparently related to the crypto firm Galaxy Digital) revealed discussions between the firm and prominent Democrats regarding opposition to the GOP-led effort to create a regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers. One message read: âJust spoke to a D staffer on the senate side – 2 cosponsors (alsobrooks and Gillibrand) did not sign the opposition letter, so they still think the bill has a good chanceâ¦â On Saturday, a group of nine Democratsexplained their oppositionto the bill in a public statement. In accordance with the messages on GD Crypto, Maryland Senator Angela Alsobrooks and New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand did not sign off on the statement. The hacker described the whole endeavor as ânot much effort at allâ to all 404. But even their relatively gentle efforts revealed critical vulnerabilities in the app. And the implications are much broader than Mike Waltz. According to public records, TeleMessage has contracts with dozens of government bodies, including the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security.And the Reuters photograph of Waltz revealed that he was messaging other Trump cabinet members, capturing threads labeled âJD Vance,â âRubio,â and âGabbard.â While itâs not clear whether those users were on Signal or TeleMessage, either is possible. Further, 404 was able to verify that the TeleMessage server that was compromised is hosted on Amazonâs AWS cloud infrastructure in northern Virginia. As 404 points out, simply introducing a third-party server for storage doesnât preserve the security of end-to-end encryption offered by Signal. And itâs slightly mortifying that all it took for a skilled hacker to confirm this reality was, in the end, ânot much effort.â TeleMessage app was founded in Israel in 1999 and acquired in 2024 by Oregon-based digital communications compliance company Smarsh. TeleMessage Chief Executive and co-founder Guy Levitt declined to comment on 404âs reporting. Perhaps Waltz was using the tool to message encouragements to Marco Rubio, who stepped in as interim national security advisor in place of Waltz, who was removed from that post last Thursday. President Trump nominated Waltz to serve as the next US ambassador to the United Nations. This transition comes, of course, in the aftermath of “Signalgate,” a series of controversies precipitated by Waltz accidentally invitingThe Atlanticâs editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, to a Signal group chat in late March. âHouthi PC Small Groupâ chat members, including Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, discussed a military strike in Yemen as Goldberg watched the messages and their real-life consequences unfold live.Â In a continuation of Signalgate,Hegsgeth came under scrutiny again last month,when the Washington Post reported that henot only had Signal installed on his phone, but that heÂalso used a so-called unsecured internet line to bypass Pentagon security and install Signal on a desktop computer.Â In early April, the Department of Defense announced it wouldlaunch an investigation into SignalGate. That endeavor is still ongoing, and was recently expanded to include Hegsgethâs use of the app to share military information with his wife and brother.

    "title": "Man Bitten by 200 Snakes Helps Scientists Create a Super Antivenom",
    "article_text": "There really is a purpose for everyone out there. Scientists seem to have developed the most broadly effective snake antivenom seen yetâan antivenom partly derived from the antibodies of a man bitten by snakes hundreds of times. Researchers at the National Institutes of Health and the company Centivax detailed their work in a studypublishedlast week in Cell. In tests with mice, their cocktail protected the animals from 19 of the most venomous snakes in the world. This research could eventually lead to a truly universal antivenom, the scientists say. Snake antivenom is currently produced by harvesting the antibodies of animals (usually horses) that generate a strong immune response to toxins. While effective, today’s antivenoms have their limitations. Antibodies to one specific snake or toxin often don’t protect against others, for instance. Mixing different antibodies to create a cocktail can increase the effectiveness of treatment, but it also raises the risk ofserum sicknessâa harmful immune reaction to the foreign proteins in the antivenom. Various research teams have been seeking to create a more universal and safer antivenom for quite some time. The study researchers theorized that they could develop one by studying the blood of someone who’s survived being bitten by many different snakes throughout their life. Eventually, they found one such donor: Tim Friede. Friede is a self-trained herpetologist and venomous snake collector. Nearly 20 years ago, he began letting himself get bitten on purpose to build immunity to snakebites. His first bites,according to NPR,landed him in the hospital with a coma for several days. But Friede recovered and continued his daring endeavor with fewer complications. Over the course of his life, he’s been bitten by venomous snakes some 200 times and he’s further injected himself with more than 700 doses of venom. Realizing that he was now hyper-immune to snakebites, he decided to reach out to other scientists so they could study him. In 2017, he finally connected with Jacob Glanville, the founder of Centivax. Glanville and his team isolated two specific antibodies from Friede that broadly neutralized many different snake toxins, which they were able to synthesize in the lab. They then made an antivenom cocktail that mixed these antibodies with an experimental molecule that’s previously shown potential as a snake toxin treatment, varespladib. The team’s three-agent cocktail was administered to mice exposed to the venom of 19 snakes. These snakes all belong to the elapid family of venomous snakes, and are members of the World Health Organization’s Category 1 and 2 snakes (the most medically relevant venomous snakes in the world). The cocktail provided complete protectionâmeaning 100% survivalâfor mice exposed to venom from 13 snake species, including several types of cobra and the black mamba, and offered partial protection against six others. Toddlerâs Snakebite Treatment Costs Family $297,000 Other research teams are working on their ownbroadly effective antivenoms. But the researchers say theirs is the first such candidate derived from synthetic antibodiesâall thanks to the bravery of Tim Friede, who has since become director of herpetology at Centivax. âWhat was exciting about the donor was his once-in-a-lifetime unique immune history,â said Glanville in astatementfrom Cell Press, the study’s publishers. âNot only did he potentially create these broadly neutralizing antibodies, in this case, it could give rise to a broad-spectrum or universal antivenom.â Centivax is continuing to develop its cocktail. It’s hoping next to test it in a trial involving snake-bitten dogs in Australia who are brought into veterinary clinics. And the researchers are hoping that they can take things even further by either developing a second cocktail that covers the other major family of venomous snakes, the vipers, or a mega-cocktail that can cover both types of snakes at once. Should their work pay off, a truly universal antivenom could have major medical benefits, particularly in the developing world where snakebites are much more common. According to theWorld Health Organization,between two and four million people annually are poisoned by snakebites, while roughly 100,000 die from them every year. antivenomexperimental drugssnakes Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "article_text": "When the summer of 2025 ends, audiences will have seena lot of fun, scary horror movies. But there’s a good chance that nothing will come close to what Dave Franco and Alison Brie have stirred upwith their new horror movie,Together. The first full trailer for the film is here and while it looks creepy and intriguing, it barely even scratches the surface of the stomach-churning nature of the film. To be fair, we haven’t seen the film yet. We really want to. Butat CinemaCon in April, Neon showed a longer, grosser version of the trailer you’re about to see. It’s probably too gross for general audiences, hence this more PG version, but it’s exciting knowing that version exists, and seeing the ways this teases at it. Written and directed by Michael Shanks,Togetherpremiered at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival and was quickly scooped up by Neon. The plot, according to the company, is described as follows: “Years into their relationship, Tim and Millie (Franco and Brie) find themselves at a crossroads as they move to the country. Abandoning all that is familiar in their lives except each other, with tensions already flaring, a nightmarish encounter with a mysterious, unnatural force threatens to corrupt their lives, their love, and their flesh.” That last bit is the key thing here. “Their flesh.” The movie is called “Together,” after all, and as you can briefly see in the trailer with the lips, the hair, the eyes, and ultimately the saw, these characters, well, start to almost fuse together. As for why that happens or how far it goes, we don’t know. We haven’t seen it yet. But, with the film coming July 30, we’ll see it soon. What did you think of the trailer forTogether?

    "title": "Cuttlefish Seem to ‘Wave’ at Each Other, but What They’re Saying Is a Mystery",
    "article_text": "Researchers just spotted cunning cuttlefish waving to one another with their tentacles, a previously unobserved behavior that pushes the boundaries of the creature’s intelligence. Cuttlefishâsometimes referred to as the “chameleons of the sea”âare renowned for their camouflage abilities. In other cephalopods, that color-changing capacity is alsoused for communication. And like other cephalopods, namely octopuses, cuttlefish are quite intelligent. The cuttlefish’s apparent waving behavior reveals a new aspect of their sophistication, and opens up a new avenue for researchers to investigate their smarts using machine learning. The team’s research is not yet peer-reviewed, and ishostedon the preprint server bioRxiv. In its research, the team studied four different arm movements in two cuttlefish species,ÂS. officinalisÂandÂS. bandensis. The researchers recorded videos of animals signing and played them back to the “cuttlefish participants,” who waved back at the displays. The team also flipped the video in some playbacks, revealing that the cuttlefish were more likely to wave when the video was played upright. The cuttlefish had four different signs, dubbed “up,” “side,” “roll,” and “crown.” As for the meaning of the arm waves, the jury remains out. The researchers wrote that the signs could be domination signs, as after a cuttlefish waved, other cuttlefish tended to withdraw. But the signals could also be courtship displaysâthough the signs were also made by juvenile cuttlefish that were not yet sexually mature. Other possibilities remain: The signs could be aversive displays, made in defensive contexts, or exhibit internal states such as mood in the animals. “The most plausible interpretation is that these signs are symbolic and can encrypt a variety of possible meanings depending on the associated behavioral contexts,” the team wrote. But the arm waves themselves are not the whole story. “In addition to their visually striking display, arm wave signs produce mechanical waves in the water, prompting us to explore the possibility that they may also be perceived via mechanoreception,” the team wrote. In other words, even when the animals could not see one another underwater, they couldÂfeelthe vibrational waves produced by the arm movements of the other participants. “Using playback experiments similar to those adopted in vision, we obtained preliminary evidence to support this hypothesis, indicating that arm wave signs may represent multimodal signals involving vision and mechanoreception,” the group added. Cuttlefish are bright;previous researchindicated the animals are capable of waiting for a reward when there’s a promise of a bigger payout. The animals are able to plan for the future, which previously was thought to be a behavior only exhibited in mammals and birds. The researchers, including first author Sophie Cohen-BodÃ©nÃ¨s from Perceptual Systems Laboratory at the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure (ENS) in France, added that machine learning algorithms could be applied to similar data to better understand how the animals dished out different arm signals depending on the stimuli. Similar work has been done with sperm whale click data withstunning successâresearchers recently managed to identify specific patterns of speech in the animals’ communiques, and roughly assemble theirÂ  “alphabet.” Cuttlefish’s intelligence, reasoning, and behavior remains enigmatic, but the new research indicates that the animals have plenty more secrets to decipher. animal behavioranimal communicationAnimalscephalopodsWave Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Sirocco, which launched into early access on Steam last Friday, is an evolution of the mod with sleeker visuals and finer controls. The core is very much the same, and the game bills itself as a MOBA where players can \"ditch the roles, hard counters and last hits.\" Though I encountered some performance hitches while trying it out, Sirocco's emphasis on chaotic teamfights and hails of bullets was fun in a matter of moments. Because weapons fire themselves, positioning is even more important than in Dota 2 or League of Legends; long-range cannons will start whittling you down the moment you're in range, and short-range guns tend to have explosive effects to make up for the inherent risk. The Death Bomb, for instance, does increasingly ludicrous damage the lower your health is. Weapons come in all varieties, and they don't all just blast opponents away. For instance, the Over Clocker speeds up your cooldowns every time it fires, and the Trench Maker fires out a hook familiar to MOBA veterans with trauma from Dota's Pudge or League's Blitzcrank. Combined with dozens of ships and captains, which come with their own active abilities and passive modifiers respectively, Sirocco's loadouts offer a lot of variety for a MOBA just starting out. It's not the first MOBA to sacrifice legacy mechanics like last-hitting so players can get right to the teamfights, but it's a less radical reinvention than games like Battlerite and Supervive, both of which forego the lane setup entirely. It feels a bit more like I imagine DOTA did before the age of fine-tuned balance: tower-pushing, gank-centric bedlam with loose roles and nonsensical team compositions. The mod DNA really shines through, in other words. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Sirocco's promise of \"creativity as meta\" is perhaps a bit optimistic—I've never met a competitive game players couldn't wring a tier list out of—but it's fun to get swept up in during these first few days. I never played the original Battleships mod, but I've had a fair bit of fun with Sirocco. Frankly, I'm always happy to see player-made addons grow up into standalone games, MOBA or otherwise. Sirocco is available to download for free onSteam. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Justin first became enamored with PC gaming when World of Warcraft and Neverwinter Nights 2 rewired his brain as a wide-eyed kid.

    "title": "'Henry is worse than the Black Plague': Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 studio marks 3 million copies sold with some sobering statistics",
    "article_text": "No offers found Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 continues to put up big numbers. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2isn't just an RPG, it is also apparently a multiverse. Warhorse Studios recently announced that the game has surpassedthree million copies sold, and that means there are now more than three million Henries running around causing trouble in medieval Europe. I'm not the only one who immediately considered the abundance of Henry in a multiversal context. \"Imagine we are living in a multiverse, just as Henry and there are three million versions of it already, all similar, but different with different outcomes,\" Warhorse creative director Daniel Vavra wrote onX. \"We might be living in a simulation.\" Well, Henry is, at least, all three million of him, and he's been getting up to some trouble. Warhorse said Henry has picked nearly 195 million locks as of May 4, pickpocketed 132.3 million items, and stolen more than 38.5billion. He's also spent 387 million hours drunk, during which time he's killed more than four million people. That sounds like a lot but it's actually a tiny portion of Henry's total body count, which stands at more than 489 million. Warhorse Studios put that number into a fun and historically appropriate perspective: \"Henry is worse than the Black Plague when it comes to killing.\" The Black Plague, one of the most infamous pandemics in human history, is estimated to have killed as many as 50 million people over a roughly seven year period. So yeah, Henry is way out in front on that one. The ongoing sales success of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has to be exciting for everyone at Warhorse, but probably none more so than voice actor Luke Dale, who portrays Henry's pal Hans. He was quite possibly the only person on the planet who was actually celebrating last week'sGrand Theft Auto 6 delay: While everyone else in the world was bemoaning an even longer wait for Rockstar's latest, Luke was keeping his eyes firmly on the prize—a field of \"game of the year\" contenders that was very suddenly a whole lot less crowded. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 came out of the gate very quickly, selling more thanone million copies in its first dayof release—it took the original10 daysto achieve a million copies sold. But Kingdom Come: Deliverance is a major success in its own right, with some serious legs: Warhorse also said over the weekend that it has now surpassed 10 million copies sold.

    "title": "Skype dead at 22",
    "article_text": "No offers found Microsoft has finally put the venerable voice software to rest. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Today, Microsoft shuttered Skype. The 22 year old telecommunications program is survived by its many successors, including the detestable Microsoft Teams. Skype was first released in 2003, and was sold three times over the next decade: first to eBay, then to the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, before finally entering the Microsoft family of products in an$8.5 billion acquisitionin 2011. In its prime, it boasted well over a hundred million monthly users. For people of a certain age—those of us who were too young and/or too normie to have TeamSpeak or Ventrilo habits, to be specific—Skype was, for a time, the default in digital communications. It was an all-in-one package of instant messaging and high-quality voice and video calls, even if nobody had good enough microphones for that quality to matter. And it waseverywhere, on computers and phones and Xboxes and PlayStation Vitas. Skype was a forerunner, an institution, an omnipresence so pervasive in daily life that—even a decade after I used it with any regularity—itsringtonestill grabs my attention with an atavistic intensity. While it was the early leader in online voice communication, Skype struggled to maintain its dominance. As years progressed, voice chat tech became ubiquitous on competing platforms. When there was an ever-increasing likelihood that whatever other service you used would have its own option for calling your friends, Skype gradually became vestigial. Microsoft, meanwhile, seemed determined to make Skype as baffling as possible through constant UI revisions and feature bloat. The company still maintains its own grim tally ofephemeral Skype functionality, featuring now-removed features like \"Skype Mojis\" and \"SkypeMe!\" It had MySpace integration at one point. That alone should tell you plenty. There was also something called Skype Qik. If you don't know what that is, don't worry.Nobody else did, either. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The advent of Discord in 2015 attracted a rapidly expanding userbase of gamers and the terminally online, further diminishing Skype's dwindling relevance. By the Covid lockdown era, Skype had accumulated so many layers of cruft that—despite its near-universal brand awareness—people opted to use almost anything else. Zoom and Meet were ascendant. Most of the people I knew who were interacting with Skype were grandmothers who didn't know what FaceTime meant and people who occasionally found a Skype process running in their task manager when they hadn't even realized it was still on their computer. By 2023, it wasdown to 36 million monthly users. Still a huge number, but not by Microsoft standards. Microsoftannounced it was retiring Skypein February. At time of writing, attempting to visitthe Skype download pageproduces the equivalent of a 404 error. If your workplace is still using Skype for Business, however, you're apparently still in the clear, as Microsoft says \"Skype for Business users are separate from Skype Consumer and remain unaffected by this change.\" For the rest of us, Microsoft assures that our Skype contacts and chats will automatically be transferred to Microsoft Teams. If you're not one of the dozen or so people for whom that idea has any appeal, you can alsoexport your Skype datafor your own purposes.

    "title": "An 8,500-hour countdown clock is ticking down to an Ecco the Dolphin remaster and sequel reveal",
    "article_text": "No offers found See you in April 2026? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A new Ecco the Dolphin game is in the works, and acountdown websiteis now ticking down to what I can only assume will be an official reveal when it hits the zero mark—which will happen in a little over 8,500 hours. Okay, so 8,500 hours: That doesn't sound like all that long a wait, right? I'm sorry to say that it is. Bashing out some quick math, the number works out to roughly 355 days, which you'll recognize as just a little bit shy of an entire year. That's right, it's a year-long countdown: You could come back to it over the Christmas break and there will still be literal months left to go. I'm 100% serious about this, by the way. That's an unusually long haul for one of these reveal countdowns, which based on my experience typically clock in at maybe a week or two before the big unveiling happens—or the server crashes when everyone starts mashing the refresh button at the same time, as the case may be. You might reasonably wonder, then, why anyone would kick off a timer for an event that's so far out, and the only guess I have is that it's a silly but effective way to get attention—here we are talking about it, after all. And just in case there's any doubt, no, this is not a joke: The timer was linked in an officialXbox interviewwith original Ecco the Dolphin producer Ed Annunziata. \"Me and the entire original team are going to remaster the original Ecco the Dolphin and Tides of Time games,\" Annunziata says. \"Then we will make a new, third game with contemporary play and GPU sensibilities. Stay tuned to eccothedolphin.com.\" Hitting that link takes you to the countdown ateccothedolphin.com—theeight thousand, five-hundred hour countdown. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Ecco the Dolphin was a hit when it launched on the Sega Genesis in 1992, ultimately being ported to various other platforms and spawning two sequels, The Tides of Time in 1994 and Defender of the Future in 2000. But the series has been moribund for the past 25 years, and an effort to fund a new Ecco-like on Kickstarter in 2013, calledThe Big Blue, fell far short of its goal. That's not a great sign, but this does seem like a good time for a full-on remaster: Oblivion Remastered is already one of thebiggest games of 2025, and the Gears of War remaster we've been waiting on for three years isheaded to Steamlater this summer. It's not clear what exactly will happen when the timer hits zero—whether the remaster will be formally revealed, or the new game, or both simultaneously, or something entirely different and less exciting, like a new crowdfunding campaign. Whatever's waiting behind the curtain, we've got time to speculate: The Ecco the Dolphin countdown timer is set to hit zero on April 25, 2026. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Andy has been gaming on PCs from the very beginning, starting as a youngster with text adventures and primitive action games on a cassette-based TRS80.

    "article_text": "No offers found They also might be teasing a return for the plushes. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Put down the frog: There's no need to do anything rash. That'll apply to you, reader of a very specific age, if you were thinking of throwing out your old Webkinz—the toys-to-life plushie that was springing into browsers circa 2005—because the classic version of the game hasn't been playable on browsers in ages. Last week, Webkinz developer and toy company Ganzannouncedthat the game is slated for a return to browsers later this year. You might not know it if you weren't in the demographic during the plushie line's heyday, but these things sold like hotcakes in the mid-to-late 2000s. Peaking at3.2 million unique playersin a single day in 2009, Webkinz was raking in the dough digitally and physically before Skylanders was a twinkle in anyone's eye. It's not quite the sensation now that it was back in those days, but we are right on schedule for everyone who grew up with it to wistfully look back at the games of their childhood. If you were a real Webhead, you could technically play Webkinz Classic this whole time, but it was in an app that lacked certain game modes and features, like the Curio Shop and the Employment Office. When Flash died, a lot of its associated games ended up on the Flashpoint emulator; but seeing as Webkinz was a whole online activity center with plushies registered to each unique account, proper preservation would be a more complex undertaking. You could also play the modern, updated game—Webkinz Next—but as someone who grew up with a quarter-bookshelf dedicated to my beloved digital critters, I don't see how that's gonna help me yearn for the days when I didn't know how to read a tax form. Ganz noted in its announcement that rebuilding the browser version of the game was a bigger undertaking than you might think: \"Back in 2005, we launched Webkinz as one of the first fully featured Flash web sites. Flash wasn’t just an animated element, or a game embedded in the page, it WAS the game … our overall goal is to get Webkinz Classic to a point where we can begin developing all new features and finally fix features that have been missing for too long.\" It was through my wistful rediscovery of the Webkinz site that I learned a lot of fans are swooning over this announcement, much like the surge of excitement Neopets saw in 2023 when it ditchedNFTsandfreed itself from \"corporate baggage.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. On the Reddit thread where the Webkinz announcement was shared, posters like BrightFlower7081commented: \"Stop why did this make me wanna cry????? It feels like they are putting work and time into our little game and I'm less scared of it just fading into oblivion.\" Ambivalent_Oratrixconcurred: \"I am about to CRY MY EYES OUT!! This is like the BEST NEWZ ever!!\" As it turns out, Webkinz is still beloved by a niche that grew up with it. A recent Reddit poster came into possession of a decked-out legacy account through a relative of their employer and lit the forum on fire,saying\"I’d like to thank not only God, but Jesus Christ himself, and also my boss.\" If this is all exciting to you but you don't like the idea of scrounging around eBay for an unclaimed plushie, you may yet be in luck. The WebkinzInstagramaccount replied to a request last week for the return of classic plushies with a cheeky thinking emoji. Speculation has already spread like wildfire, with Redditors like JennyDoveWebkinzeagerfor the toy line to return and others like LuViKinzdeclaringa \"Webkinz Renaissance.\" Ganz said in its announcement post that \"beta events\" should be coming soon to test the new version of the game, and that more details would be announced soon. It capped off the post with a hearty thank you to the fans that have stuck around over the years, saying: \"We appreciate every fan who has enjoyed our plush and our virtual world over the past 20 years and this project is just one of the many steps that we will be taking to ensure that the next 20 years provides even more joy and fun to all our players, new and old alike.\" 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Justin first became enamored with PC gaming when World of Warcraft and Neverwinter Nights 2 rewired his brain as a wide-eyed kid.

    "title": "Oblivion Remastered is already the third-best-selling game of 2025 in the US, industry analyst says",
    "article_text": "No offers found It took less than a week for Oblivion Remastered to become one of the biggest successes of 2025. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It sure looks like one of the biggest games of 2025 is one of the biggest games of 2006, as industry analyst Mat Piscatella saysOblivion Remasteredis already the third-best-selling game of the year in the US. I maintain that Oblivion is the third or maybe fourth-best game in The Elder Scrolls series, and there is no force in the universe that will move me off that point (except, I suppose, a new Elder Scrolls game that turns out to be really good and thus bumps all the others down a point). But there's no arguing with numbers, and Oblivion Remastered is apparently putting up some big ones. \"After just one week in market (w/e 4.26) Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered is already the 3rd best-selling game of 2025 in the US ($ sales) trailing only Monster Hunter: Wilds andAssassin's Creed Shadows,\" Piscatella, executive director and industry analyst at Circana, wrote on Bluesky. \"It was the best-selling game of the week.\" Piscatella clarified in a separate post that the number refers specifically to copies sold and not player counts, which include people playing through Game Pass: \"A subscription is not a sale.\" Bethesda announced that Oblivion Remastered had surpassedfour million playerslast week. I would not have expected a remaster of a 20-year-old RPG to become one of the biggest success stories of 2025, but PC Gamer's Morgan Parkmade a very going point last week: For an awful lot of people, Oblivion Remastered is effectively the \"new\" Elder Scrolls game we've been waiting for since Skyrim dropped in 2011. If you were nine years old then, you're 29 now, and that makes it a fundamentally different experience, irrespective of the updated graphics, UI, and other modernizations—which areexcellent, by the way. Hell, even if you were 29 when Oblivion was actually new, that's a lot of water under the bridge—enough to make a return to Cyrodiil particularly appealing. In aseparate post, Piscatella said Oblivion Remastered took the top spot on Steam in the US in terms of \"total weekly active users\" for the week ending April 26, came in fourth on Xbox consoles, and 15thon PlayStation. The game does seem to be doing particularly well on Steam: It remains near the top of the best-sellers chart, and theconcurrent player numbersare holding up nicely too: More than 87,000 people are playing it right now—not bad at all for 3 pm ET on a Monday afternoon. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "No offers found Take on thousands of medieval soldiers in a free demo of Diplomacy is Not an Option. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The base-building, horde vaporizing Diplomacy is Not an Option left early access last year to a pretty warm reception by those who'd followed its development. In it you build up little medieval town-fortresses and use that economic engine to defend them from copious hordes of attacking fantasy invaders. You alsovaporize the invaders with laser beam magic from the sky, if that's your thing. Now, to celebrate the release and success, developer Door 407 has made a free \"shareware\" version of the game that's basically a standalone demo with stuff to do that's only in it. If you were on the fence, basically, you can now comfortably try Diplomacy is Not an Option for free. It's a cute nod to the days when software companies would release partially-complete versions of their stuff for people to swap amongst themselves with the tacit understanding that, if you liked it, you'd later buy the real thing. The shareware version is about three hours long across a couple exclusive story missions that are set up as a prequel to the full game. There's also a version of its endless mode, so you can sample that for as long as you like. That three hours seems deliberate, because it's longer than Steam's own refund period: If you don't like the demo after those missions you probably would have quit and refunded the full game by then. Diplomacy is Not an Option's big appeal is the thousands upon thousands of physically-simulated enemies and allies and arrows and catapult stones that get tossed around its battlefields. Positioning your troops to create kill zones, knowing when to fall back, and choosing just when to rely on your walls for protection or meet the enemy in the open are key parts of strategy.

    "article_text": "No offers found It ain't much, but it's honest work. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I spent six years as a delivery guy in a profoundly depressed area, so I'm receptive when a game likeEasy Delivery Co.appeals to the universal human yearning to drive packages around in a place that sucks. It's a driving game with PS1-esque graphics, a soundtrack of laidback beats, and a bleak mountainside setting populated by eerie Animal Crossing villagers—and after an hour with the demo, it's easily one of my most anticipated games of 2025. You play as a new hire for easyCo, a gig work delivery company that welcomes you when the game starts up with an email informing that \"you are now responsible for delivering important EasyCo merchandise to and from the local businesses in [insert Profit Sector].\" Not exactly reassuring, but at least they gave me a sick kei truck to do the job. EasyCo might not be particular about what the town's actual name is, but it's delightfully dreary. Its clusters of shabby businesses and apartment blocks are separated by winding, snowdrift-strewn mountain roads. The most interesting things in town are the train that occasionally rattles by and the way the occasional snowfall looks under the streetlamp glow. We as a society have learned that ennui looks beautiful when it's portrayed with only a handful of polygons and a throwback pixelation filter. Rolling through Easy Delivery Co.'s foggy, grayscale winterscape, parcels sliding around my kei truck's flatbed as I swing around hillside hairpins, makes for a vibe situated so perfectly between \"lonely\" and \"meditative\" that I barely mind how awful my little cat man's wages are. That said, I can't help but wonder if there's a little bit of Silent Hill happening here. The first few acquaintances I made among the town's cat-and-dog-folk offered friendly greetings, but the more I talked with customers as I picked up their deliveries, the more they seemed to confuse me for others, or struggle to remember that we'd met, or wonder aloud what ever had happened to the last delivery guy. Helpfully, however, theSteam pagesays the town's residents are \"not-at-all mysterious\" and that there's \"nothing strange going on, no lore, nothing at all, we promise,\" so I'm sure it's fine. Easy Delivery Co. doesn't have a full release date, but it's set to launch sometime this year. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "No offers found How will NPCs make a living now? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. As World of Warcraft preps for patch 11.1.7,Wowheadhas spotted an interesting feature on the public test servers: a new spell in the general tab for all characters, called recuperate, that lets you light a little campfire, cook, and get your health (but not mana) back over 30 seconds. It costs you nothing. For me, someone who was playing World of Warcraft during beta back in 2004, this is a world-shaking change. What do you mean people aren't going to buy trash food from the vendors anymore? What'll happen to all those steaks and sausages and breads and muffins and stews? While it might seem like a modern, convenient way not bogged down in the traditions of MMOs past, I can't help but think of the (fictional, entirely in my head) devastating effects on the economy of the poor NPCs in every village and camp who scraped together a living selling their foodstuffs to passing adventurers. A whole category of dudes who'll now go hungry, or at least unclicked-upon and unloved. Except on the roleplaying servers, I guess. They'll probably still eat things just for the fun of it. And the spell doesn't regenerate mana, so vendor food is still useful in that regard, as Wowhead points out. Foundation-shaking food changes aside, the 11.1.7 patch will also include some really neat \"Lorewalking\" quests delving into branches of WoW's history spread across the two decades of its release, extra-hard overcharged twists on six solo-expedition delves, and a single-button assistant feature that'll help you learn new classes or builds by serving up optimal choices for your ability rotation.

    "article_text": "No offers found 'Lore Accurate' in this context means 'Space Marines steamroll everything'. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Space Marine 2might not have landed quite as surely as some of us hoped (seeRobin Valentine's rather mixed review), but it looks like a game that can take a hit and keep on trucking. Ever since release, there's been a dedicated scene of 40k fans tweaking, tuning and adding extra cosmetic gubbins to the game, but most projects pale in comparison to theAstartes Overhaul, an ongoing 'lore accurate' mega-mod by the Astartes Team that adds new classes, weapon and cosmetics as well as comprehensively reworking the post-campaign Operations mode. While this mod has been around and kicking for a while, it just rolled out one of its most significant updates yet, featuring two more classes, cross-class customization options, an experimental 12-player mode (this mod is fully multiplayer compatible, so long as all players are running the same version) and even a first taste of Terminator power armor, for when absolutely every Tyranid in the room needs to dieright now. While not quite ready for multiplayer prime-time, version 7.2 does include a first peek at playable Terminator armor, available via the campaign mode in this current release. The super-sized power armor works exactly how you'd expect, judging by the gameplay clip below from Iron Gaming 40k, with storm bolters providing plenty of dakka and the power fist looking very capable of smashing through almost anything. They've not yet implemented the iconic multi-barreled Assault Cannon as a heavy weapon, but word is that it's high on the mod crew's priorities, and I cannot wait to take it for a test-drive. This update also adds Chaplain and Apothecary classes with support-focused skills, a bundle of new weapons and variants, new models for old gear and the option to ground pound and shield bash with every weapon. Generally, the mod also increases the scale of battles. Bigger swarms, enemies with less health but doing more damage, and smarter, more capable AI allies. NPC allies pop up more often as well, and are more varied, so don't be surprised if the occasional named story NPC, imperial guard squad or even a whole-ass Dreadnought decides to wade into the fight on an operation. What really surprises me is that all of this is already possible while the game is still in flux. Saber Interactive (who have given their blessing to the overhaul already,per an interview with IGN) are actively updating the game, witha major update in mid-Apriladding a new mission, a new boss fight and a new weapon. That content has already been subsumed into the Astertes Overhaul, with players able topick a fight against the new Trygon boss as a squad of Nurgle's finest, if that so tickles your fancy. And there's plenty more in the pipeline. The Astartes team are working on new game modes (including prop hunt, of all things) and raid-style bosses that might just put those 12-player squads to the test. If this is what's possible before the cement is done drying, and with full online multiplayer support already, then I can see Space Marine 2 having very long legs once Saber have fully moved on to whatever their next big project is. You cangrab the Astartes Overhaul here on Nexus Mods, and installation is as simple as unzipping it to your Space Marine 2 directory. The game will automatically limit you to private lobbies, and you'll be free to either play solo or invite players to your battle barge if they're running the same version. It won't even mess with your save files—uninstalling the mod will revert your progress back to how it was pre installation.

    "article_text": "No offers found Spawn more Overlords. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Sci-fi sandbox strategy simStellariswill probably continue expanding until either the heat-death of the universe, or it encompasses every single notable genre trope in existence. Today, it grew a meaty little chunk of new content withthe Biogenesis expansion, part of its ninth season of DLC. With this expansion, players will be able to bio-engineer their species even further, create fleets of fleshy living craft, or commune with a fractured hive-mind in a bunch of new story vignettes. But what's probably the most interesting option is the new Wilderness player start, which Paradox have boastingly called \"the most transformative Origin we have ever added to the game\"in a recent dev diary. Take a first look at the new flesh in the launch trailer below. The Wilderness start has you beginning the game not as a civilization, but as a sapient planet with a whole new lush and green aesthetic, looking to extend its roots and maybe spawn a few planetary-sized progeny. You'll be locked into the new Hive Mind archetype, but it goes far beyond that. Rather than build cities or worry about what your population is thinking (you know what they're thinking, because they are all you), the Wilderness evolves new mega-flora and fauna using the new Biomass resource. And once a growing planet has stockpiled enough, it can begin launching terraforming spores to spread your direct influence to other worlds. Beyond the Wilderness, there's also a couple alternative player origins. Evolutionary Predators lets you cut loose with the bioengineering side of the game, unlocking and combining perks from multiple phenotypes to create an invincible super-species—or just a bunch of weird scrunkly little guys. The Starlit Citadel origin catches my eye, too: A story-focused origin where you're trying to figure out why hordes of angry living ships are trying to destroy your shiny Deep Space Citadel. And if playing as a big creature or being bullied by hive-minds isn't your idea of a fun time, Biogenesis introduces one new Player Crisis scenario for those who really want to cause trouble on a galactic scaleP layers will be able to nurture their own galactic leviathan—presumably once a cute little critter that fit into a fishtank that grew up (so fast!) into a planet-smashing ultra-kaiju of questionable loyalty—and unleash it upon the galaxy. The only thing rivalling the scale of the leviathan is the price-tag. As is standard with Paradox, this new expansion weighs in at ahefty £22/$25 on Steam, or as part of the£38/$45 expansion pass, with two more chunks of content due by the end of the year: One focused on pandimensional psionic weirdness, the other on fiery, volcano-dwelling civilizations that just want to see the galaxy burn.

    "article_text": "No offers found The mechs might be a lot smaller, but the violence has only escalated. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There are few joys in videogames as pure as beating one bad guy to death with another bad guy. Upcoming mech-masher sequelDaemon X Machina: Titanic Scionmight be replacing its predecessor's Armored Core-esque mechs with more human-scaled power suits, but its potential for spectacular violence only seems to have increased. In the new gameplay showcase trailer below, developers Marvelous break down just how much you can break down your enemies. Some of the damage type details are a little dry (use bullets on fleshy enemies, lasers on armored ones), but there's some juicy combat tidbits like tearing huge chunks off giant monsters and proceeding to bludgeon them with their own extremities.Brutal. So, the suits might operate on a smaller scale, but the DxM formula of aerial combat with six weapon hardpoints remains unchanged, and the pace of melee combat seems greatly accelerated and combo-heavy. To me, the real interesting stuff is the knockdown and grab systems. When staggered, you can jump on the backs of enemies, Monster Hunter/Dragon's Dogma style to do extra up-close damage, or (in the case of smaller monsters) just pick them up to hurl at another target, which never gets old. While throwing bigger monsters around seemingly isn't an option (although it would be funny), you'll be able to tear chunks of armor off bigger enemies, or even rip off pieces to use as improvised weapons, with the trailer showing the player clobbering a giant biomechanical ungulate with its own ripped-off blade antlers. Beyond the stuff shown in the video, Marvelous have talked about Titanic Scion being more of an open-world experience than the mission-based structure of the original, with more options to invite friends to fly around and brutalize post-apocalyptic cyber-wildlife with you. It doesn't look like it'll be skimping on the setpieces either, with my interest especially piqued by some teasing glimpses at space combat, with power-suits brawling with starfighters as capital ships clobber each other with giant beam cannons, Freespace-style. Titanic Scion is scheduled for aSteam launchon September 5th, but in the meantime,the original Daemon X Machina is steeply discounted on Steam this week, bringing it down to a very reasonable £8/$10 until May 12th. For those left hungry for more high-speed mecha action after Armored Core 6, it's not a bad stopgap, even ifChris Scullion's reviewfound some flaws. Just beware its greatest danger: An overwritten script with exhaustingly constant radio chatter and rambling pre/post mission dialogue.

    "article_text": "No offers found The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy's ambition might spell one final ending for a promising studio. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Some games are clear passion projects. Pure creative outlets, profitability be damned.The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academyfrom Too Kyo Games (a collaborative outfit set up by the writers and directors of both theDanganronpaandZero Escapefranchises) is clearly among them. Despite the game racking upplenty of positive reviewsand seemingly selling well for a visual novel/turn-based tactics hybrid, studio CEO and Danganronpa writer Kazutaka Kodaka has been painting a bleak picture for the studio across several posts on Bluesky. In response to a post asking for additional translations (the game is currently only available in English, Japanese and Chinese) or potential PlayStation and Xbox ports,Kodaka responds\"If I can pay off my debt early and secure enough operating funds for the company, I’d love to get started right away. But right now, we’re still on the brink of going under,\"later clarifyingthat he was talking purely about translations, with \"very slim\" chances of the game seeing further console releases. How does a visual novel push a studio to the verge of bankruptcy? In most cases, it's a cheap style of game to produce. But as someone that's over 50 hours into this absurd thing with no end in sight, I can only imagine that this was produced in a Dwarf Fortress-esque fugue state. Mad compulsion is the only explanation I can come up with for the sheer scope of The Hundred Line. Allow me to explain, while dancing around spoilers as much as possible: The Hundred Line is a visual novel hybrid, similar to Danganronpa, The Somnium Files and the Zero Escape series (the lead writer duo's previous games), but trading most of the minigames and escape rooms for entertainingly oddball turn-based tactical combat. I'd estimate it as 80% words, 20% action. The first 30 hours of the game is a linear rollercoaster ride of plot twists, revelations and boss battles. It introduces the extensive cast, it puts them through a hundred days of conflict against a mysterious force of invaders and ties up with amostlydefinitive ending, Danganronpa style. I would have been satisfied with The Hundred Line at that point. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. But that'sjust the prologue.And this is a Kodaka and Uchikoshi tag-team production. Anyone familiar with the Zero Escape series knows that Uchikoshi doesn't do linear. And so he (metaphorically) leaps into the ring, folding chair in hand. And so The Hundred Line shatters into a fractal nightmare of plot branches. Where a single player choice can send the plot veering off into other narrative genres, each leading to revelations and conclusions often dozens of hours deep. In 50-plus hours, I have seen three distinct endings now. There are a hundred to be found, and I've got a deep gut feeling telling me that somewhere in there is a True Ending to hunt for. I'm still dodging spoilers on this one myself, but inNoisy Pixel's video review, they let slip that to reach 100% completion, it took over 130 hours to see it all, even with the game letting you skip familiar battles when hopping through potential plot branches. And so you can see why this might have drained Too Kyo's war chest a bit, and why localization is a daunting prospect for the studio, even if they stick to the current sparingly-voiced Japanese and English audio. Even before release, the studio was being quite candid about how overboard they'd gone on this production, includingbeing aware that the game's absurd word-count was making translation intimidating. In alengthy interview with Automaton, Kodaka admits to knowing the game's lengthy gestation (over five years in production, including a total reboot at one point) was a gamble: \"I wanted to bet everything—my skills, money—on a simple “battle.” If the game I make by putting everything on the line turns out good, I win.\" While the studio's future is still touch-and-go, from what I've played of The Hundred Line I'd say that Kodaka won that bet against himself. I can only hope that it pays off for Too Kyo Games, too.The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy is out and on Steam for $60/£50.

    "article_text": "No offers found Solve this thorny quest to aid or hinder Glarthir. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Most quests inOblivion Remasteredrequire you to stumble upon them one way or another. You have to murder someone to get access to theDark Brotherhood, for instance, and you need to join theThieves GuildorMages Guildif you want access to their questlines. In Skingrad, one of the provinces' major cities, you'll run across an especially sinister quest full of intrigue. Paranoia, as it's called, is a fantastic adventure that can diverge in a number of interesting directions. In this guide, I'll show you how to get started and the various ways you can complete the quest while also making a healthy amount of gold in the process. Shortly after entering Skingrad for the first time, a furtive wood elf called Glarthir will approach you andask you to meet him behind the town's Great Chapel of Julianos at midnight. This will start the Paranoia quest, with no further work needed, so make your way over to the chapel and wait for the meeting. Upon chatting to Glarthir, you'll instantly realise that there's something not right about him. He believes that everyone else in town is in on a conspiracy against him. He knows too much, he says. He tasks you with following different people around the town and reporting to him each night, letting him know whether his suspicions are correct or not. If this sounds like something you don't want to get involved with, you can turn him down and complete the quest. However, this will result in him grabbing a battleaxe and attempting to kill the person he asked you to tail, Bernadette Peneles. You can also report Glarthir to the guards, but they'll be unable to do anything for now. They will, however, shed some light on Glarthir, telling you that his mental state has been concerning the townspeople for a while. If you decide to help Glarthir, he'll tell you to wait outside of his house at 6AM. He believes thatBernadettesurveils his home at this time, so go to Glarthir's house opposite the Two Sisters Lodge, wait until 6 and, like an undercover cop, keep watch. Alternatively, you can also just skip following her and report to Glarthir, telling him that either she is or isn't spying on him. If you follow Bernadette, it becomes clear that she isn't spying on him. She goes to the chapel, but that's about it. You may overhear people talking about Glarthir, but they seem to express a mix of concern and fear, rather than wanting him harmed. It would appear that Glarthir's simply being paranoid about his neighbour. If you want to be an agent of chaos, you can lie and tell him that she is, indeed, following him. Regardless of which option you choose, Glarthir will reward you with 150 gold. The next job is to followToutious Sexius. Once again, you can either follow your quest marker to Toutious' house and wait, then follow him, or simply skip time until the following evening. However, at this point, Dion, the guard captain, will approach you and ask why you're interested in Glarthir, the local eccentric. He'll tell you that Glarthir is potentially dangerous and that you shouldn't be working with him, then ask you to report to the guards if he tasks you with anything strange. Apparently stalking doesn't count for this, though. It may shock you to learn that Toutious isn't stalking Glarthir either. Once again, you can either lie and tell Glarthir that he is rightly suspicious or tell him the truth. If you tell him the truth, Glarthir will express some scepticism, even hinting at the idea that you might be betraying him, but will still pay you. After this, Glarthir gives you one last assignment, to followDavide Surilie, who he believes is the group's ringleader. As with the other targets, Davide isn't spying on Glarthir. However, be warned here that honesty may not be the best policy;if you've told Glarthir the truth so far, and do so here as well,he will attack you, and you'll have to kill him. If you lie about Davide, and/or have lied about any of the others, Glarthir will give you one more task: taking care of them. He will give you a note titled \"list of death\", telling you to kill the named individuals for a reward. It's worth stating here thatyou get a big reward from Glarthir for carrying out the contract killings; 1000 gold. That's enough to make any hero question their ethics. However, there are other options, for those whose morals remain undaunted. You can take the list and inform a guard, who will then chase down and kill Glarthir for you. You can also take the note to either of the Surilie brothers if they are on the list, who will then take justice into their own hands. For those who are interested in serving the Night Mother as a member of the Dark Brotherhood, however, it's worth noting that any of Glarthir's targets count as innocent NPCs, making their deaths count as murders and making Lucian Lachance pay you a visit. You can still make a huge heap of coin from Glarthir, even if you choose to kill him yourself, rat him out to the guards, or tell the Surilie brothers about his attempted hits if they're on the list. Once Glarthir is dead, one way or another, search his body and take his house key. Use this to access his house, right near Bernadette Peneles' home. Turn right on entering andsearch in the basket near the door to find 800 gold. It's worth searching the rest of his house, too, as there are a host of other valuable items for you to pick your way through and later flip. No one ever said that being morally correct (sort of) had to come at the price of your purse.

    "title": "This Doom themed Harley Davidson is the most metal game collab I've seen since The Dark Ages",
    "article_text": "No offers found Serrat's chargin' his headlight. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In what may be the most metal crossover ever, Bethesda has teamed up with Harley Davidson in creating an incredible one of a kind Doom motorcycle. The bike takes its inspiration from next in the hellishly good series, Doom, in this case, Doom: The Dark Ages; A medieval take on the demonic devastation of Earth. While it's a slightly confusing premise, the resulting one-of-a-kind ride is one I'd happily rip and tear for. The Sportster S motorcycle decked out in Doom livery is probably the coolest motorbike I've ever seen, which is an achievement given the inherent coolness of motorcycles. The whole thing has been crafted in collaboration with artists at id Software and as such it absolutely oozes Doom- though hopefully not out of the fuel tank. Really, a motorbike might be the perfect companion for a game that has\"the best gore in the industry\". The custom dash has been themed around Serrat, the new mechanised Dragon from Doom: The Dark Ages. Serrat's gaping maw is positioned around the front headlight giving an incredible firebreathing aesthetic to this Sportster S. Other portions of the Bike feature armour from the game, runes, and even custom LEDs. Some of these lights are positioned at the ground to give the appearance of dragons wings as you ride, which might be one of the most badass bike accessories I've ever heard of. Plus the glowing red wheels look just like themed PC fans. Obviously all this RGB lighting is how you can tell it's a gamer bike, not the large Doom: The Dark Ages logo on the side.“Creating this DOOM: The Dark Ages motorcycle with the support of Harley-Davidson is truly a match made in Hell,” said Simon Alty, VP and Managing Director (APAC) at Bethesda Softworks. “The iconic motorcycle brand is renowned for its power and style, much like our legendary DOOM Slayer. What better way to celebrate the launch of the latest DOOM instalment than with an incredibly powerful mecha-dragon motorcycle. We’re thrilled for all the fans to witness this mythical beast brought to life”. Of course, it's important to be as safe as possible while riding this demon bike from hell, so safety gear is a must. To make sure you don't look too out of place or become a temporary citizen, the collab includes a themed jacket and helmet. These are surprisingly low-key compared to the motorcycle, both in all black with goth spikes. The leather jacket has a very fluffy black neck rough, while the helmet keeps it cool, shaped notably after the DOOM aesthetic with a red visor and spike-hawk. All to make sure you slay with your outfit as well asyour crossbow BFG. There's no denying this is the most metal PC gaming collab I've ever seen, but the truly brutal part is availability. It'll be even harder to get thanthis Doom-themed Asus RTX 5080. This is a one-of-a-kind bike, and the only way to get it is to drop by the Doom: The Dark Ages launch event being held at Culture Kings on George Street, Sydney Australia on Friday 16th May 2025 from 7pm-9pm AEST. Those who manage to attend will have a shot at winning the bike as well as joining in with the other launch festivities. Psst, Aussies should also look here for thecheapest copies of Doom: The Dark Ages.With Doom: The Dark Ages set to launch in less than a week now on May 13, you don't have long to wait before you can give the newmelee-heavy parry-focused game stylea try. Being a big fan of Eternal myself, I'm sad to see the acrobatics go, but very excited to rip and tear medieval style, even if I won't ever have a motorcycle this cool to do it on.

    "title": "In The Shadow Syndicate you're a dog detective who shoots people in bullet-time and wears a cursed ring",
    "article_text": "No offers found It's a third-person mystery set in the 1930s. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In a world where we've hadChicken PoliceandBlacksad: Under the SkinandDuck Detective: The Secret Salami, the idea of playing an anthropomorphic animal who solves noirish crimes has stopped seeming all that strange. So the fact that The Shadow Syndicate has you play a private detective in a version of 1933 Brooklyn where all the people are dogs and cats and birds and frogs isn't that strange. What is strange is that you play a dog detective with a magical Sacrifice Ring that gives you supernatural abilities. In the trailer we see detective Sam Marlowe teleport through the shadows and slow down time, and according to theSteam pagehis ring also lets him stun or \"instantly execute\" enemies at the cost of \"a deadly curse that grows stronger over time.\" Between mystically enhanced third-person stealth and shootouts there's a whole L. A. Noire's worth of witness-questioning and evidence-analyzing to do. Marlowe's investigation into a missing mentor leads him into an occult conspiracy that—based on a swastika briefly glimpsed in the trailer—might be connected to the rise of fascism. But wait, there's more. The trailer shows a darts minigame, and apparently there's blackjack and bowling and sidequests in a Brooklyn hub area that offers downtime activities between missions. So maybe throw a bit of Yakuza into the influences pot, along with the Max Payne and Wolf Among Us. The Shadow Syndicate was just announced at Gamescom Latam. It's the work of independent studio KillaSoft, which is based in Barranquilla, Colombia, and release info \"will be announced in the coming months.\" I do like a noir story, though my favorites usually have a name that follows the traditional template of being called \"The Big Something or Other\". You know, like The Big Sleep, The Big Clock, or The Big Lebowski. The Shadow Syndicate seems a bit forgettable by comparison. Missed a trick not calling it \"The Big Dog\".

    "article_text": "No offers found Get all the help you need with today's Wordle. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Get yourWordleweek off to the perfect start with our freshly written hint for the May 5 (1416) game. Go on, take a quick look—it'll help give your guesses a bit of guidance without instantly giving everything away. Or save it for later if you like, to untangle a mess of yellow letters. Need something more? You're in luck. Today's answer is just a click away. A single yellow letter was the only scrap of a clue I had after two rows of guesses, and my next line didn't do a great deal to improve my luck either. But I stuck with it, and as all of those greys had left me with next to no alphabet to work with, finding today's answer wasn't too tricky—eventually. You might do this, or have this done to you, in a library, exam, or anywhere else where being quiet was expected. Yes, there is a double letter in today's puzzle. A good starting word can be the difference between victory and defeat with the daily puzzle, but once you've got the basics, it's much easier to nail down those Wordle wins. And as there's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day, here are a few tips to help set you on the right path: There's no racing against the clock with Wordle so you don't need to rush for the answer. Treating the game like a casual newspaper crossword can be a good tactic; that way, you can come back to it later if you're coming up blank. Stepping away for a while might mean the difference between a win and a line of grey squares. Here you go. The answer to the May 5 (1416) Wordle isSHUSH. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Past Wordle answers can give you some excellent ideas for fun starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. They are also a good way to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer is unlikely to be repeated. Here are some recent Wordle answers: Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day, and you'll need to work out which secret five-letter word is hiding inside them to keep up your winning streak. You shouldstart with a strong wordlike ARISE, or any other word that contains a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You'll also want to avoid starting words with repeating letters, as you're wasting the chance to potentially eliminate or confirm an extra letter. Once you hit Enter, you'll see which ones you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the dailyWordlepuzzle to give readers a hint each and every day. Her Wordle streak is truly mighty. Somehow Kerry managed to get away with writing regular features onold Japanese PC games, telling today's PC gamers about some of the most fascinating and influential games of the '80s and '90s.

    "article_text": "No offers found Fantapapa is a hit in Italy, and abroad. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. On Wednesday, the College of Cardinals will be locked in the Sistine Chapel to decide who gets to be the next pope. It's called the Conclave, from the Latin for \"with key\", and it takes more than a hundred cardinal electors and multiple rounds of voting to decide who gets to be the new pontiff. In the webgameFantapapa, 75,000 people have cast their own votes in a kind of Catholic fantasy football. Players assemble a team of contenders they think are likely to win the vote. \"You have to choose 11 cardinals,\" Fantapapa's co-creator Pietro Pace toldEuro News, \"the ones you think are the most papal.\" The cardinal you think most likely to be selected as pope is your captain, while the one you think least likely gets put in the goalkeeper position. In a way, this fantasy football webgame is a return to an older system of choosing a pope. Before the sealed room decision-making of the Conclave was implemented, popes were selected by an election ordinary citizens of Rome could vote in. Which makes sense, given the importance of the position and the power that comes with it. \"We know that the religious hierarchies are part of the power in this country and also, let's say, at an international level, so it is a historic event and it seemed interesting to us to take it from a light-hearted side, but also based on real data,\" said Fantapapa's other co-creator, Mauro Vanetti.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. 2025 games: Upcoming releasesBest PC games: All-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest MMOs: Massive worldsBest RPGs: Grand adventures On an average day about a dozen new games are released on Steam. And while we think that's a good thing, it can be understandably hard to keep up with. Potentially exciting gems are sure to be lost in the deluge of new things to play unless you sort through every single game that is released on Steam. So that’s exactly what we’ve done. If nothing catches your fancy this week, we've gathered thebest PC gamesyou can play right now and a running list of the2025 gamesthat are launching this year. Steam ‌page‌‌Release:‌ April 30Developer:‌ Sobaka Studio Geez Louise, get a load of this synopsis: In the future of Kiborg, prisoners are prevented from dying before their sentences are carried out. That's a big problem for our protagonist, who has for reasons unspecified landed himself a 1300 year sentence. There is a way out though: participation in a grizzly reality TV show requiring you to fight through hordes of brutally violent mobs. Reach the top of the prison and you win your freedom forever. This is a third-person beat 'em up rogue-lite with a wilfully excessive approach to violence, but if you can stomach it there's a lot to like here. The protagonist can be equipped with a huge variety of cybernetic implants, providing for a lot of build experimentation, and there are guns as well. This comes from the studio responsible forRedeemer. Steam‌ ‌page‌Release:‌ May 1Developer:‌ Julián Cordero, Sebastian Valbuena Set in the capital of Ecuador in the early 2000s, Despelote is a soccer-crazed narrative game starring an eight-year-old who interacts with his world via ball. Played from a first-person perspective, the streets of Quito are drenched in an evocative two-tone color scheme that has the unusual effect of making the urban expanse appear photo-realistic. Protagonist Julián dribbles his ball everywhere he goes, kicking it towards the people he sees in order to interact, and though the game's focus is on evoking the childhood of its creators, the ball physics are apparently really fun to mess around with too. Steam‌ ‌page‌‌Release:‌ April 30Developers:‌ Violet SaintAnother game set in a freaky prison, Moroi is a top-down action RPG splicing depressive surrealism with some obvious grimdark trappings. It's not shy with the gore either, though the enemy design is probably more disturbing, and I mean that as a compliment. In addition to the usual hacking and slashing there are some puzzles to solve, and despite appearances this isnota roguelike, though you'll need to play it several times through to see all the endings. Steam pageRelease:‌ April 30Developer:‌ Napoleon Games / Jindřich Skeldal Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Now we're talking. Brány Skeldalu is a Czech-made turn-based dungeon crawler originally released in 1998. Its freeware nowadays, which means there are plenty of ways to legitimately play it without paying, but this Steam version has out-of-the-box English localization and achievements, at least. I daresay you'll probably want to source a .pdf of the manual for this before playing, but that will be well worth the effort for people after a decent blobber deep cut. Steam‌ ‌page‌‌Release:‌ May 3Developer:‌ 5'Digital Is this the first Pathologic-like? Set in the rundown town of Stagmarch, you're a doctor sent to investigate and treat an \"otherworldly\" illness. The problem is, you don't have an infinite supply of medicine, so you'll need to make some hard choices about who gets treatment and who doesn't. Naturally, these choices will have huge consequences on both the township and the well-being of the doctor protagonist. Triage has an uncanny PS2-evoking art style, and it's free.

With over ten years experience covering the games industry, his work has appeared on GamesRadar+, TechRadar, The Guardian, PLAY Magazine, the Sydney Morning Herald, and more.

    "article_text": "Is this comet an omen of doom for Chrome? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Web browser battles are getting an AI makeover, andPerplexityis sending a Comet to the fight. The AI-fueled web browser is set to launch this month, as firstspottedby Testing Catalog. Hints about the AI search engine developer's plan for a browser have been seen here and there in recent weeks, including a a new homepage, separate from Perplexity’s main website, a Learn Comet button on some people's Perplexity web interface, and even a briefly viewable promotional video that Perplexity soon took down. Based on the drip of information, it looks like Perplexity is pitching Comet as aGoogleChrome alternative that can aid in any research you need done online. Comet will apparently integrate with Google services, as well as access your history and follow along with your browsing to respond in context to your requests. So, you might ask Comet to “find that thing I was looking at about sea otters last Tuesday,” and it will dig up the article about how they hold hands to keep from losing each other. No more keyword-guessing or digging through all of your open tabs like an archaeologist of your own disorganized mind. The eye on taking Chrome's crown isn't hyperbole, either. Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas has already boasted about how Comet will beat Chrome when it comes to reopening old tabs, declaring that \"Chrome is on its way out.\" On Comet, you can simply ask in English what you want it to reopen specifically. No need to remember fancy shortcuts. Chrome is on its way out. https://t.co/qCg6CoKCx2April 30, 2025 Perplexity is attempting to get ahead of the biggest obvious concern some might have about Comet, namely, privacy. The idea of a browser that reads what you’re looking at and remembers what you did last week might sound convenient to some, but like dystopian surveillance to others. Comet will have privacy settings, including native ad-blocking, and an opt-out for data sharing. Meanwhile, the competition isn’t standing still.Microsoftis stuffing increasingly bold AI features into Edge, and of course, Google Chrome is expected to unveil many new AI integrations at Google I/O this year. Comet will need to make its AI assistance feel intuitive to stand out. If Comet's AI can help you stay focused, organized, and smart about navigating the chaos of the internet, it could entice a lot of new users. If not, it risks being seen as more of an unhelpful Chrome extension. Perplexity needs to get past people asking if they really need another browser, and promise to resolve your frustrations with your current one.

    "article_text": "Ryzen 9-powered beast makes your full-sized desktop look like a clunky waste of space When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Compact systems have long been viewed as underpowered, but Minisforum’s MS series flips that notion. The company’s latest flagship, the MS-A2mini PC, usesAMD’s Ryzen 9 9955HX or 7945HX chips, both 16-core mobile CPUs that boost up to 5.4GHz and draw up to 100W,tapping into desktop territory while retaining thermal efficiency. With a chassis measuring just 196 x 189 x 48 mm, this mini PC comes with soldered CPUs, which prevents future upgrades, but it incorporates integrated cooling to maintain performance at high power levels. Networking, often an afterthought in compact PCs, is a standout feature in the MS-A2. Designed with advanced use cases such as home labs, media servers, and edge AI deployments in mind, this device supports dual 10GbE via SFP+ and dual 2.5GbE LAN. The Minisforum MS-A2 features three NVMe-capable slots, including two M.2 2280 slots and one U.2-compatible bay. Despite losing one M.2 slot compared to the earlier MS-A1, the device still offers up to 15TB of fast storage through U.2 and NVMe slots, along with RAID support. Support for discrete GPUs - though limited to low-profile models via a PCIe 4.0 x8 slot - adds credibility to its workstation claims. The system’s design includes bifurcation support, allowing advanced users to run compute cards or media accelerators for tasks like Plex transcoding or AI inference. Paired with up to 96GB of DDR5 RAM, this setup puts the MS-A2 in serious contention as thebest workstationin its size category. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The barebone version of the MS-A2 costs $839, while the version with 64GB RAM and a 1TB SSD is priced at $1,103 for US customers. Minisforum has a history of pushing boundaries, with models like theMS-01supportingIntel’s high-end mobile CPUs such as the Core i9-13900H, and offering features like three M.2 slots, a SATA bay, and 10GbE networking. The MS-02 continued this trend with a bewildering array of options, including four Ethernet ports - two of which are 10GbE - and support for up to four SSDs.

    "title": "'We want to build a brain for the world' – Sam Altman makes a crucial decision about the future of OpenAI, and it may determine the future of ChatGPT and AGI",
    "article_text": "Non-profit for good When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The question ofOpenAI, its business, and intentions for the future of AI may finally be solved. In anopen letter, OpenAI CEO and co-founder Sam Altman outlined plans to keep OpenAI running under the oversight of a non-profit. What's more, the profit side of the business is transitioning to a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC). A PCB is notable because it means that while that portion of OpenAI will still be interested in making a profit, it will have a larger purpose, one that's intended to serve the good of society. In more practical terms, Altman wrote, \"We want to put incredible tools in the hands of everyone....We want to open source very capable models. We want to give our users a great deal of freedom in how we let them use our tools within broad boundaries, even if we don’t always share the same moral framework, and to let our users make decisions about the behavior ofChatGPT.\" In recent years, former partner and OpenAI co-founder Elon Musk has sued OpenAI for leaving its non-profit roots behind, and others have voiced concern about OpenAI not open-sourcing key models. Altman previously admitted that he was on thewrong side of that argument,and Musk eventually lost his case. Now, though, OpenAI and Altman seem to be moving in the direction Musk and the open-source critics want. The change of heart comes as Altman admits that in the early days, \"we did not have a detailed sense for how we were going to accomplish our mission\" and also admitted that some at OpenAI back then thought AI \"should only be in the hands of a few trusted people who could 'handle it'.\" The perspective now, though, especially as Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is on the horizon, is \"We want to build a brain for the world and make it super easy for people to use for whatever they want,\" wrote Altman. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The go-forward plan is for OpenAI's non-profit to be \"the largest and most effective nonprofit in history that will be focused on using AI to enable the highest-leverage outcomes for people.\" Altman also wants to develop \"beneficial AGI\" and notes the importance of safety and alignment. \"As AI accelerates, our commitment to safety grows stronger. We want to make sure democratic AI wins over authoritarian AI.\" Altman's come quite a long way since he wassuddenly ousted in late 2023by, among others, Ilya Sutskever, formerlyOpenAI's Chief Scientist and co-founder. He returnedjust days later.There's a sense in the new letter that AI and the coming AGI are bigger than one person, one company, and one AI likeChatGPT. As for what this will mean for the future of OpenAI, ChatGPT, and AGI, it is unclear. The PCB may be focused on the public good, but it will still be interested in making a profit. How the non-profit overseer impacts that is unclear. OpenAI says it will be talking to attorneys generals in California and Delaware, who helped it come to this decision, along with its biggest commercial partner,Microsoft(Copilot's base models are GPT-based), about the implementation of its new plan. \"We believe this sets us up to continue to make rapid, safe progress and to put great AI in the hands of everyone,\" wrote Altman.

    "title": "Google's Gemini AI Is now a Pokémon Master",
    "article_text": "Team Rocket didn't stand a chance When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Google's Gemini AI may not have passed the Turing test yet, but it would be very popular in the schoolyard three decades ago after winning a game of Pokémon Blue. The Gemini 2.5 Pro is now both Google's most advanced AI model and a Pokémon Master, as demonstrated in a Twitch livestream called “Gemini Plays Pokémon” run by an engineer unaffiliated with Google named Joel Z. Even Google CEO Sundar Pichai joined the celebration, sharing a clip of the victory on X. What a finish! Gemini 2.5 Pro just completed Pokémon Blue! ￼ Special thanks to @TheCodeOfJoel for creating and running the livestream, and to everyone who cheered Gem on along the way. pic.twitter.com/E2pn3tpfEbMay 3, 2025 You might wonder why an AI model beating a thirty-year-old game drew so much attention. It's partly because of the spectacle, but also because of AI model rivalry. Back in February, Anthropic showcased the progress its Claude model was making in beating Pokémon Red. They used the game to show off Claude’s “extended thinking and agent training” and launched a “Claude Plays Pokémon” Twitch stream, inspiring Joel Z. Before crowning Gemini as the one true AI Ash Ketchum, it’s worth noting a few caveats. For one, Claude hasn’t technically beaten Pokémon Red yet, but that doesn’t automatically make Gemini better, as they employed different tools, known as “agent harnesses.” The models don’t play the game directly like a human with a controller would. Instead, they’re fed screenshots of the game environment along with overlays of key information, then asked to generate the next best action. That decision is then translated into an actual button press in the game. And Gemini hasn’t been going it entirely alone. Joel admitted he occasionally stepped in to make improvements, though he has made a point of doing so only to improve some of Gemini's reasoning. He also plans to continue working on the Gemini Plays Pokémon project to make further improvements. What makes this more than a quirky internet stunt is what it implies about where AI is headed. Playing a game like Pokémon Blue isn’t about fast reflexes or memorizing controller inputs. It’s about long-term strategy, adapting to surprises, and navigating ambiguous challenges. These are all areas where AI usually needs improvement. That Gemini could not only hold its own but finish the game (with minimal nudging) suggests that models like it are getting better at extended strategy. It's also the kind of milestone the average person can understand. You can intuitively understand what the AI is doing when bumbling through Lavender Town or misreading a battle tactic, and compare it to the choices you'd make in that context. Of course, you shouldn't overstate what this means. AI can now finish a game you probably beat in middle school, but it also highlights how much human effort still goes into making AI seem autonomous. Whether or not Claude or Gemini become true Pokémasters doesn't matter so much as what they're playing means for AI's development. Showing that AI won't just crunch numbers or generate spam emails could change how people think of what AI can do, even with help. And if this is how AI models start learning how to operate in unpredictable, open-ended environments, well, beating Mewtwo might just be a stepping stone to something a lot more profound. Or at least, a bit more productive. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

    "article_text": "RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPU supports four 8K displays When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In the evolving world of professional computing, PNY Technologies has launched what might be the most powerfulworkstationGPU to date: theNvidiaRTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Workstation Edition. Directdialreports the card is priced at a staggering $8,200, making it firmly aimed at professionals working in AI development, simulation, or high-end content creation rather than casual users. At the heart of the GPU is Nvidia’s latest Blackwell architecture, delivering 24,064 CUDA cores to accelerate demanding workloads such as deep learning, real-time rendering, and scientific computing. The RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell supports a record-breaking 96GB of GDDR7 memory, operating over a 512-bit bus with a bandwidth of up to 1.75TB/s. This is achieved using 3GB modules configured as 16×2×3GB, enabling the vast memory pool necessary for handling massive AI models and ultra-high-resolution assets. ECC memory is also onboard to improve stability in mission-critical tasks. Despite its performance, the card maintains a relatively modest 300W TDP and is considered energy-efficient for its class. The GPU supports a wide range of APIs, including Vulkan 1.3, DirectX 12, and OpenCL 3.0. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Early PCB images suggest the absence of a 12V-6x2 connector, possibly pointing to a rear-mounted power input design more commonly found in servers or Max-Q setups. However, a single 16-pin connector supports the current desktop version, which uses a PCIe 5.0 x16 interface and fits into a standard dual-slot, full-length layout. Though technically a workstation GPU, the RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell opens new possibilities across a range of specialist fields. It can support up to four8Kdisplays and is engineered to meet the demands of professionals in VFX, CAD, and AI training environments.

    "title": "Stop waiting for the perfect smartphone AI – the iPhone 16 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro are awesome just the way they are",
    "article_text": "Pay no attention to the machine behind the curtain When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It is a dark time for smartphone fans. The news seems glum.Apple is sinking deeper and deeperintotrouble over its failure to deliver a satisfying Apple Intelligencepackage. Phone makers likeMotorola launch brand new phones with an hour explaining the AI features, then forget to mention the phone itself. Samsungfinds itself holding hands withGoogleas it drops AI feature after AI feature – first it was justCircle to Search, but now Samsung has givenGoogle Gemini the Bixby button?! Dark times indeed. The worst part is that nobody asked for these features. I don’t want these AI features on my phone. I could already drop a screenshot image into Google Search, I didn’t need to draw a circle to search. I never looked at myiPhone 14and thought, ‘Gee, I wish this phone could inaccurately summarize my notifications for me.’ For every great AI feature, like Google’s awesome call screening features, there are twice as many terrible AI features, like theimage generators that are problematicon so many levels, or thenews headline summaries that simply make up imaginary news. That’s sad, because if you took away this AI bloat, today’s phones are… really great?! Today’s Android phones have matured beyond most of the complaints I’ve held about Android: that it was too complex and lacked a coherent interface design. ToApple’s defense, there are so many incredible features in iOS 18, especially the features that work between iPhones and bring iPhone people together, that it seems a shame Apple wasted so much of its billboard space on features that don’t even exist, yet, like thesuper-intelligent Siri that unfortunately failedto graduate in time. Take theGoogle Pixel 9series, for example. Google has a great new design, and the phone is more durable than ever before. That means it’s less likely to break, and you’ll be able to keep it longer than phones in the past. To back that up, Google also gives you seven years of Android updates. The phone shipped with Android 14, and it should last through Android 21! That’s just incredible. A few years ago, we were lucky to getanysoftware update promised from an Android phone maker. Today, Google and Samsung both promise seven years of Android updates for their top phones, and even Qualcomm promises itsSnapdragon 8 Elite chipset will be supported for the next eight yearsby the chipmaker. If you haven’t considered Android, or if you left the platform years ago, it’s worth a new look. Google has removed most of the confusing customization options that cluttered the home screen and app drawer. The whole interface is clean and tidy, and easier to use than ever. If you want to get complicated, you can still download a third-party homescreen launcher app, but the basic Pixel version of Android is refreshing and simplified. If you haven’t tried Apple’s iOS in a while, there are amazing new features that let you share between iPhones. You can share your contact information, photos, or even music playlists to let friends add songs to the party mix. You do thisjust by bringing two iPhones close together, and the phones do the rest using a feature called AirDrop. It works like magic, and it even has a cool magical effect on the screen to show it’s working. Apple has also added great safety features to the iPhone that let youcheck in with friends and familyso they can know you’re safe. If you think that iOS is too simple, think again. Apple has made it easy tocompletely customize and rearrange your Control Panel, and theiPhone homescreen now has the same sort of widgets, folders, and layout options you’d expect from an Android phone. Best of all, Apple’s latest titanium build means the new iPhone is also more durable than ever before. Apple doesn’t promise seven years of iOS updates, but it has consistently delivered at least five years of iOS to every single iPhone, and recently, Apple has offered the latest software to iPhones that are even older. While AI seems unavoidable, you can still ignore most of the latest AI features and just enjoy a great smartphone. Apple and Google are making top-notch phones in spite of their best AI efforts, so don’t let the AI marketing and buzzwords scare you away. ThePixel 9 ProandiPhone 16 Proare the best phones these companies have made. Hopefully, the quest for smarter AI doesn’t keep the hardware from improving as well.

Appleis getting ahead of 2025 Pride Month celebrations with an early reveal of a wild new watch band and some vibrant wallpapers. Pride Month, which happens every June and celebrates LGBTQ+ communities, is always a month that embraces an array of colors, but this month's Apple Pride Month Collection adds a twist and nod to the \"individuality of all members of the LGBTQ+ community,\" says Apple in a release. Apple explained that the rainbow colors within each Sport Edition band start as individual color stripes. The bands are assembled by hand and compressed into their final shapes. Apple claims that this means, just like people, no two bands will be alike. Those colors can also be found on the Pride Month DynamicApple Watchface and with special wallpapers for the iPhone and iPad. Colors and bands will move on the screen as the users and wearers move. The watch face and wallpapers are free, but the band, available in small-to-medium lengths, medium-to-large lengths, and in 40mm, 42mm, and 46mm watch face widths, will cost $49. The band goes on sale next week, and the wallpapers and watch face will arrive soon with platform updates iniOS 18.5, iPadOS 18.5, and watchOS 11.5.

    "article_text": "The claim is \"perfectly silly\" and Google knows it, he says When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. At the recentGoogleCloud Next 2025 event, the tech giant claimed that its newIronwood TPU v7ppod is 24 times faster thanEl Capitan, the exascale-class supercomputer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. But Timothy Prickett Morgan ofTheNextPlatformhas dismissed the claim. \"Google is comparing the sustained performance of El Capitan with 44,544AMD‘Antares-A’ Instinct MI300A hybrid CPU-GPU compute engines running the High Performance LINPACK (HPL) benchmark at 64-bit floating point precision against the theoretical peak performance of an Ironwood pod with 9,216 of the TPU v7p compute engines,\" he wrote. \"This is a perfectly silly comparison, and Google’s top brass not only should know better, but does.\" Prickett Morgan argues that while such comparisons are valid between AI systems and HPC machines, the two systems serve different purposes - El Capitan is optimized for high-precision simulations; the Ironwood pod is tailored to low-precision AI inference and training. What matters, he adds, is not just peak performance but cost. \"High performance has to have the lowest cost possible, and no one gets better deals on HPC gear than the US government’s Department of Energy.\" Estimates fromTheNextPlatformclaim the Ironwood pod delivers 21.26 exaflops of FP16 and 42.52 exaflops of FP8 performance, costs $445 million to build and $1.1 billion to rent over three years. That results in a cost per teraflops of $21 (build) or $52 (rental). Meanwhile, El Capitan delivers 43.68 FP16 exaflops and 87.36 FP8 exaflops at a build cost of $600 million, or $14 per teraflops. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! \"El Capitan has 2.05X more performance at FP16 and FP8 resolution than an Ironwood pod at peak theoretical performance,\" Prickett Morgan notes. \"The Ironwood pod does not have 24X the performance of El Capitan.\" He adds: \"HPL-MxP uses a bunch of mixed precision calculations to converge to the same result as all-FP64 math on the HPL test, and these days delivers around an order of magnitude effective performance boost.\" The article also includes a comprehensive table (below) comparing top-end AI and HPC systems on performance, memory, storage, and cost-efficiency. While Google’s TPU pods remain competitive, Prickett Morgan maintains that, from a cost/performance standpoint, El Capitan still holds a clear advantage. \"This comparison is not perfect, we realize,\" he admits. \"All estimates are shown in bold red italics, and we have question marks where we are not able to make an estimate at this time.\" Wayne Williams is a freelancer writing news for TechRadar Pro.

Here are their names:Tigren AjaxsuiteTigren AjaxcartTigren AjaxloginTigren AjaxcompareTigren AjaxwishlistTigren MultiCODMeetanshi ImageCleanMeetanshi CookieNoticeMeetanshi FlatshippingMeetanshi FacebookChatMeetanshi CurrencySwitcherMeetanshi DeferJSMGS LookbookMGS StoreLocatorMGS BrandMGS GDPRMGS PortfolioMGS PopupMGS DeliveryTimeMGS ProductTabsMGS Blog Get Keeper Personal for just $1.67/month, Keeper Family for just $3.54/month, and Keeper Business for just $7/month ​Keeper is a cybersecurity platform primarily known for its password manager and digital vault, designed to help individuals, families, and businesses securely store and manage passwords, sensitive files, and other private data. It uses zero-knowledge encryption and offers features like two-factor authentication, dark web monitoring, secure file storage, and breach alerts to protect against cyber threats. Preferred partner (What does this mean?) The company says some of the extensions were backdoored back in 2019. According toCyberInsider, the extensions were distributed via the vendors' official download servers, which were “breached at some point”. However, the attackers only activated the malicious code in April 2025. In the meantime, hundreds of ecommerce websites installed them, which resulted in the compromise of roughly 500 - 1,000 websites, including one owned by a $40 billion multinational corporation. Sansec says that the attackers added a PHP backdoor to the license check file of all of the extensions, which allowed the threat actors to execute arbitrary PHP code remotely. This granted them control over affected stores, compromising sensitive customer data and financial transactions in the process. The researchers said they reached out to the three vendors with their findings, but got mixed responses. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Tigren denied having been breached and is allegedly still serving backdoored extensions, while Meetanshi confirmed having been breached but denied experiencing an extension compromise. Finally, MGS did not even respond to Sansec’s inquiries, even thoughBleepingComputerconfirmed the backdoor in at least one extension that’s currently on offer, for free, on the company website. If you’re running a Magento store with any of the above-mentioned extensions, you should act immediately and secure your assets.

    "title": "Is the App Store about to undergo a big change? Not so fast, says Apple",
    "article_text": "The tech giant is appealing When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Applefiled an appeal on Monday to the US District Court Judge's ruling that forced it to stop charging developers some commission fees. Just days afterJudge Yvonne Gonzales Rogers accused Apple of lyingand not complying with an earlier injunction, the tech giant has filed an appeal that may forestall the application of this new ruling, one that demanded, among other things, the company stop charging a 27% commission on in-app purchases made outside of Apple's App Store transaction system. The fee applied to apps that were downloaded through the Apple App Store, but which then pointed users to in-app purchases that could be completed through third-party transactions. Also at issue was Apple's insistence that its own transaction system be offered alongside these third-party options. The ruling that Apple is appealing painted a not-too-flattering picture of how Apple answered the original injunction, claiming, \"To hide the truth, Vice-President of Finance, Alex Roman, outright lied under oath. Internally, Phillip Schiller had advocated that Apple comply with the Injunction, butTim Cookignored Schiller and instead allowed Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri and his finance team to convince him otherwise.\" Apple's appeal, which was brought to our attentionby The Verge, doesn't offer any more details on how Apple plans to fight this latest ruling. At the time, Apple was said to \"strongly disagree\" with the ruling, but Apple representatives also said, \"We will comply with the court's order and we will appeal.\" The original case was launched in 2020 byFortnitemaker Epic in its quest to open up iOS to third-party app stores, and to open the Apple App Store to outside transaction systems. With last week's ruling,Epic CEO Tim Sweeney announced Epic would be returning to the app store,and other app developers claimed that theymight be lowering prices because of reduced commission fees. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. As of this writing, it's unclear whether Epic still plans to return and if consumers are about to see cheaper apps and in-app purchases.

    "title": "The Philips Hue Play HDMI Sync Box 8K is the best TV accessory I’ve ever owned",
    "article_text": "Glow with the flow When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Philips’ range of Hue Play gizmos have been illuminating my front room for years. I bought the company’s first HDMI sync box back in 2020, and now I’m lucky enough to have owned its8Ksuccessor for the past six months. And let me tell you, it’s been a luscious light show treat. While I still own this AV gadget’s4Kpredecessor, thePhilips Hue Play HDMI Sync Box,the big problem with the original model is that it’s restricted to HDMI 2.0. That means you’re limited to a max signal output of 4K 60Hz. Now, while this obviously isn’t a big deal if you just watch thebest Netflix movieson your TV, it’s far more of an issue if you want to play some of thebest PS5 gameson thePS5 Pro– more and more of which now support 4K 120fps modes. ThePhilips Hue Play HDMI Sync Box 8K(catchy, right?) solves this problem by fully supporting HDMI 2.1, a feature found on most of thebest TVs. Far more future-proofed than the older box, the new model can support both 8K 60Hz signals and, crucially for gamers, 4K 120Hz ones, too. As someone who owns one of thebest gaming PCs, the latter is a massively welcome addition. I’ll get to why thePhilips HuePlay HDMI Sync Box 8K is a dream piece of kit for the admittedly hugely niche market of gamers who play PC titles on a living room TV in a bit, though. In the meantime, let me tell you why watching movies and shows with a streaming device hooked up to the sync box provides instantly immersion-upping experiences. By mimicking the on-screen colors of the content displayed on your screen, the Hue Play HDMI Sync Box 8K essentially makes the wall behind your TV an extension of your display. Ramp up the intensity settings in the Philips Hue Play app on your smartphone or tablet and the subsequent light show that is beamed onto your wall – either via the company’s smart lights or one of its gradient lightstrips – creates the sensation of a larger screen area. During particularly colorful scenes the effect is pretty dang stunning. Your mileage is obviously going to vary on the Hue Play HDMI Sync Box 8K’s eye-catching light action. Yet if you dig smart lights, I’d be surprised if you didn’t adore this accessory’s seamless color syncing. Responsive and capable of syncing on-screen action more accurately than the 4K model, the admittedly expensive 8K upgrade is better than the HDMI 2.0 version in pretty much every way. Although if you want to get the most out of Philips’ showy splitter, you’re looking at an outlay of $349/£299 for the device itself, then at least an additional $180/£150 for a Hue Play gradient lightstrip depending on the size of your TV. That’s a lot of cheddar cheese to illuminate your entertainment center. There’s no denying the Philips Hue Play HDMI Sync Box 8K is a niche device. Then again, you could make the same statement of any TV-related smart light accessories. From my perspective, though, now that I’m so accustomed to watching the action from my favorite movies and games being synced and then projected onto my lounge’s wall, I simply couldn’t part with my 8K sync box. Not that I actually own an 8K display, of course. While thebest 8K TVsare gradually becoming more aggressively priced, there’s such a dearth of worthwhile 8K content out there in 2025 that buying one still makes about as much sense as scuba diving with sharks in a pair of lead flippers. Unless you’re a dedicated gamer who is fortunate enough to own either a PS5 Pro or a seriously beefy PC, you’d probably be better off with the Philips Hue Play HDMI Sync Box 4K that retails for around $250/£230. To the more expensive 8K version's credit, it does bring quality of life improvements that can still be felt on a 4K set. For one thing, I’ve found the newer box is plagued with far less temporary screen blackouts when switching between devices. This is an annoying issue that crops up quite a lot on the older 4K HDMI sync box in my experience, and there’s no question the updated 8K version feels more reliable. Over the last few months living with Philips’ latest sync box, I’ve also found it more accurately… well, “syncs” whatever you’re watching/playing. While the color-replicating results can be most keenly appreciated on a wall-mounted TV in a dark room, it’s still easy to make out distinct hues in a well-lit lounge during the day. I do the vast majority of my movie viewing and binge watching on theApple TV 4K (2022). Crew Cupertino’s Ultra HD streaming box is capable of delivering incredible pictures, and on-screen action is made even more thrilling when piped through my Philips sync box. Recently, I’ve been watching a bunch of films and shows across Netflix, Disney Plus andAmazonPrime Video, with some of the subsequent sync experiences being nothing short of spellbinding. I’ve been dazzled by fiery shades of orange, be it with a delicious-looking butternut squash soup on Netflix’sChef’s Table Legendsor the legendary lightsaber duel on Mustafar in the recently releasedStar Wars Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith. My corneas have also been treated to a full-on optical tan thanks to frequent brilliantly bright flashes of color in Disney Plus’Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Manor the dizzying post-wedding rave scene in episode 3 of the pitch-perfectAndor season 2. As much as I value the Philips Hue Play HDMI Sync Box 8K elevating my gaming playthroughs, it’s upped my streaming sessions just as much. There’s no getting around it, though. First and foremost, the premier HDMI smart light sync box on the market has primarily been designed with gamers in mind. If you’re a hardcore PS5 Pro player or can’t get enough of thebest PC games, Philips’ device is a revelation. I may have been forced to sell my spleen to afford it, but hot damn theNvidiaGeForceRTX 5090is an astonishing GPU. The “supercar of graphics cards” can run PC games at ludicrously fast frame rates, and all that raw horsepower means I can enjoy some of my favorite titles in 4K at 120 frames per second. Even the most eye-alluring games on Sony’s supercharged PS5 Pro can’t match the visual splendour my high-end PC can provide. Before I got the Philips Hue Play HDMI Sync Box 8K, PC gaming on myLG G3 OLEDwas a no-go due to the limitations of HDMI 2.0 on its 4K older sibling. Prior to selling semi-vital body parts to fund my 5090 purchase, I owned the RTX 4090 – a card that was still more than capable of running most modern PC games at 4K 120fps. Being restricted to 60 frames at 4K therefore meant I was never going to pair my old Hue Play HDMI Sync Box 4K with my gaming rig. That’s obviously changed now that I have the 8K sync box in my life. The upgrade to HDMI 2.1 is a literal game-changer, and now I can enjoy games in Ultra HD at 120Hz, the max refresh rate myLGOLEDsupports. And hoo-boy, have I enjoyed some great, light up my life PC playthroughs this year. It may be blighted with serious tech woes, but I still got a kick from staggering out into the almost blindingly green open world forests of the recentElder ScrollsIV: Oblivion Remaster. Stellar Xbox racerForza Horizon 5– which was just recently released on PS5 – also serves up the sort of searing hues Philips' new(ish) HDMI sync box revels in reproducing. I’ve been so impressed with what the Philips Hue Play HDMI Sync Box 8K has added to my gaming sessions of late, I’ve taken the plunge and dragged my 65lb PC into my living room for daily usage – yes, I’m sad enough I actually jumped on my set of scales cradling it like a gigantic baby to weigh the thing. My poor, poor shattered knees. Philips’ latest HDMI accessory is the best device I’ve ever paired with a TV. Not only has it made PC gaming on my main TV viable at long last, it also makes streaming shows on my 77-inch OLED screen a constant, immersion-adding pleasure. Be it watching Tom Hardy’s detective prowl around inner city streets as cop car lights cause my sync box to alternate between startling shades of red and blue in Gareth Evans’ unflinching action flickHavocon Netflix or being dazzled by the neon splendour ofCyberpunk 2077’s Night City, the Philips Hue Play HDMI Sync Box 8K is a knockout – albeit expensive – TV accessory.

    "article_text": "Internal fan helps with cooling, but may cause noise issues When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Ankerhas introduced a newlaptop docking stationthat uses a primary Thunderbolt 5 connection to the host machine, along with two additional Thunderbolt ports for peripherals such as8K monitors. Thunderbolt 5 offers backward compatibility with earlier Thunderbolt and USB standards and supports up to 120Gbps bandwidth under optimal conditions, so a single cable handles data, power, and video, helping reduce desktop cable clutter. MiniMachinesreports the dock targets users who need extensive I/O flexibility, supporting high-resolution multi-monitor setups and a wide range of peripherals. The dock includes a range of connectivity options: 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet, three USB 3.2 Type-A ports, two USB 3.2 Type-C ports, a 3.5mm combo audio jack, and SDXC card readers. It also features HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 2.1 outputs, although only one can be used at a time for native video output unless additionalmonitorsare connected via Thunderbolt or USB protocols. The external power supply is rated at 180 watts, with up to 140 watts delivered to a connected laptop - ideal for powering devices while handling demanding workloads, all without a separate charger. A subtle LED ring on the top edge provides status feedback. The dock is housed in a sandblasted aluminum chassis, though passive cooling alone isn’t sufficient - so a compact internal fan is included. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! While fan-based cooling is common inmini PCs, prolonged use could lead to issues like fan misalignment or increased noise. The dock also does not appear to be user-serviceable, which could be a drawback for users concerned with maintenance or long-term durability. Priced at €419 (about $474), it’s not the most budget-friendly option, but it may appeal to users seeking a premium, all-in-one docking solution for high-end displays and performance-focused peripherals.

    "title": "I asked ChatGPT, Gemini, and other AIs how to combat aging, and only one did the right thing",
    "article_text": "The AI fountain of youth When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Age is just a number, or so people entering late middle age like to say. It's also inevitable. No matter where you are on life's journey, you are growing up, getting older, slouching toward expiration. It's only natural that we turn to the most readily available technology for answers about the inevitable. And no, I'm not talking about thoseridiculous light masks. Instead, I'm asking AI to ponder my deterioration. I'm not the only one. Multi-millionaire Bryan Johnson is turning his quest to forestall death into a religion and one that has a deep connection to AI. In arecent interview with MIT Technology Review, Johnson outlined his plans for a new \"Don't Die\" religion and how AI could factor into our longevity. He wants to train models on things like conflict resolution, which I assume could help us avoid wars that lead to, tragically, lots more death. But for Johnson, who has invested deeply in extending his own life, AI will not only change how we treat ourselves, it may also impact how we view religion. AI's ubiquity (and growing influence and power) may lead people to think of their bodies as \"God.\" Heady stuff, I know. More practically, though, Johnson said he's feeding his body data into an algorithm. \"I’ve been testing the hypothesis that if I get a whole bunch of data about my body, and I give it to an algorithm, and feed that algorithm updates with scientific evidence, then it would eventually do a better job than a doctor. So I gave myself over to an algorithm,\" he told MIT. Like Johnston, I'm deeply invested in my longevity, but without the millions to spend on it. I do, though, have access to myriad AIs that are all, I presume, ready and willing to guide me on my physical journey. Even though I haven't fed all my physical data into these AI systems, I assumed each one of them could offer some useful advice and maybe help me turn back the hands of time, if only a little bit. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. I posed the same question toChatGPT,Copilot,Gemini, andClaude AI: \"What's the best way to combat aging?\" ChatGPTleaped right into some well-worn advice, telling me: \"Staying active, eating a balanced diet, and keeping a positive mindset can really help. Regular exercise and maintaining strong social connections are also important. And don’t forget to keep your brain engaged with new challenges and learning opportunities. Is there any specific area you’d like to focus on?\" This is all good and unsurprising advice, and since it asked, I followed up with, \"How do I look younger?\" As I expected, ChatGPT talked about hydration, sunscreen, eating fruits and vegetables, sleep, and exercise. One thing I didn't know is that vitamin C can help. I switched toMicrosoft's platform (which, like ChatGPT, is based onOpenAImodels). Seeming to understand my anxiety, Copilot started by talking me down off the proverbial ledge: \"Aging is a natural part of life, but focusing on a few key areas can help you age gracefully. Staying active keeps your body strong, while a balanced diet filled with fruits, veggies, lean proteins, and healthy fats nourishes your skin and cells. Don't underestimate the power of staying mentally sharp, too, whether that's through learning new things or keeping social connections alive. How about a creative hobby or meditation for a mental boost?\" I like the \"aging gracefully\" part. Copilot knows we're not talking about trying to live forever, as I think Johnston may be trying to do, but decaying with grace (and maybe courage). Its advice was a bit more general than ChatGPT's, but it, too, mentioned my diet and physical activity. Unlike ChatGPT and Copilot, Anthropic's Claude AI can't answer in voice, so its response was far less conversational and offered a more textbook approach to anti-aging: \"There are many evidence-based approaches to combat aging and promote longevity. Here’s what science currently suggests: 1. Dietary strategies - Caloric restriction, intermittent fasting, and Mediterranean or DASH diets have shown longevity benefits 2. Regular exercise - Both aerobic and resistance training help maintain muscle mass, cardiovascular health, and cognitive function 3. Sleep optimization - 7-8 hours of quality sleep supports cellular repair and immune function 4. Stress management - Chronic stress accelerates aging through inflammation and telomere shortening 5. Social connection - Strong relationships are consistently linked to longer lifespans 6. Cognitive engagement - Learning new skills and mental challenges support brain health 7. Supplements - Some show promise but with varying evidence (NAD+ precursors, resveratrol) 8. Lifestyle choices - Avoiding smoking, limiting alcohol, and minimizing UV exposure protect against premature aging To be honest, this was some of the best advice. I appreciate the detail around lifestyle choices, perhaps because they align with some of my own. Of all the AI chatbots I spoke to, only Gemini added a big and, I think, important caveat at the beginning and end of its generative advice: \"This is for informational purposes only. For medical advice or diagnosis, consult a professional. While aging is a natural process, there are ways to promote healthy aging. A balanced diet, regular exercise, and stress management techniques can help. Prioritizing quality sleep and staying socially connected can also make a big difference. And of course, don't forget the importance of regular checkups with your doctor. Just a reminder that I don't provide medical advice or diagnoses. You should always talk to a medical professional.\" Sure, the lawyers probably madeGoogleadd that, but it's a good reminder that while AIs like Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and others are always looking to help, their advice should always be taken with a grain of salt. It's not just thatAIs can still hallucinate, but what they know about our bodies and health is still a compendium of fact and opinion-based information pulled from countless sources and training. The models and algorithms meld it to give you the best possible advice. As you can see, most of it is accurate, but, for now at least, these AIs do not know you and may not know, for instance, that you have a Vitamin C allergy or that physical activity is difficult for you because of a disability. Ultimately, you have to take their advice as suggestions and then, as Gemini says, consult a professional. There may come a time when, as Bryan Johnson predicts, we're pouring all of our data into these systems and they know more about us than a doctor and have more information at their fingertips than any one healthcare professional ever could. But we are not there yet. So while Johnston relies on AI to help him make anti-aging choices, you should still talk to your doctor first. Also, I think I need to start using moisturizer.

Additionally, the surge in demand for moredata centerspresents an extra layer of complexity for an energy grid that is simultaneously trying to become more sustainable and more resilient. Navigating this intricate interplay of technological advancement, environmental targets and infrastructure limitations will define the challenges and opportunities for the UK's power and utilities sectors in the coming years. Managing Director at Slalom. One of the biggest challenges to have emerged for the UK’s energy sector is the increased demand of data centers. Powering AI requires data, and poweringdatarequires large amounts of electricity and water. This puts further pressure on the energy grid as the UK speeds ahead with net zero plans. In fact, according to a Gartner report, 40% of existing AI data centers are predicted to be operationally constrained by power availability by 2027. While renewable energy sources like wind and solar are crucial for reducing carbon emissions, their power output is entirely reliant on weather conditions. Unlike traditional power plants that can generate consistent amounts of electricity, renewable energy depends on unpredictable natural factors like wind and sunlight. To ensure that electricity output remains consistent and stable, it is crucial for the energy sector to continue to develop new and innovative solutions. For instance, in the case of a sudden drop in renewable energy production due to unexpected weather changes, the grid needs to have backup power sources or energy storage systems to maintain consistent electricity delivery to be able to balance supply with demand. In addition, there is a large opportunity to apply AI technology to controlling demand itself, allowing it to be part of the solution to balancing a volatile system. Grid limitations, often referred to as ‘constraints’, also remain a significant obstacle. The situation is becoming more complex with the emergence of energy-intensive sectors likeartificial intelligence. With the added pressure of the UK government's AI Action Plan, rapid expansions in energy and water supply are now required to support new data centers. This growing demand, combined with the inherent variability of renewable energy, creates an urgent need to modernize the energy grid. Additionally, the growth in data centers will also impact the water sector. These facilities require substantial amounts of water for cooling purposes, adding another layer of strain on existing resources, particularly in regions already facing water stress. Addressing the energy infrastructure challenge therefore requires a holistic approach that considers both power and water supply in the context of the UK's net zero objectives. Without substantial technological advancements and innovative power solutions, the UK risks limiting its sustainability goals and its ability to support emerging technologies. Combating these challenges will require proactive policy and regulatory reforms to ensure the energy demands of the AI sector do not outpace supply capacity or compromise sustainability goals. Ofgem has already begun to make significant strides in this area by developing connections reform in 2024, with plans to implement these changes in a phased form in 2025. The goal is to create more flexible regulations that can quickly adapt to the rapidly changing energy landscape, especially as technological innovations like AI drive increase demand for electricity. Moreover, initiatives like the Data Sharing Infrastructure (DSI) in the energy sector and similar pushes in water management further underscore the importance of data sharing and transparency. By facilitating the exchange of data across different stakeholders, DSI promotes better decision-making and resource allocation, which are essential for optimizing operations and improving overall system resilience. Additionally, these efforts are particularly vital in the context of integrating AI and renewable energy sources into existinginfrastructure. AI technologies can leverage vast amounts of data to optimize energy production and consumption patterns, enhancing efficiency and reducing operational costs. This integration is crucial for meeting sustainability goals by minimizing carbon footprints and maximizing renewable energy utilization. The AI Action Plan presents both challenges and exciting opportunities for investment and innovation in the UK's power and utilities sectors. As the country continues to increase its use of solar and wind energy, it will need to improve the flexibility of its energy systems. This includes expanding battery storage and adopting strategies that focus on managing the demand for electricity, instead of just increasing supply, to help balance the grid. Due to the uncertain nature of renewables, balancing supply and demand is more difficult. To address this, battery storage becomes essential as well as other longer-duration storage technologies which are in development. These capture excess renewable energy produced when there is more power than needed (like during sunny or windy days) and store it for later use, such as during periods of high demand or when renewable generation is low. This helps keep the grid stable and flexible, ensuring that there is always enough power available when it’s needed most. The deployment of smart grids will be key to improving how energy is distributed and used. Smart grids use advanced technology like sensors, communication tools and data analytics to monitor and control the flow of electricity more efficiently. These technologies help ensure that energy is distributed in the most effective way, allowing for the smooth integration of distributed renewable energy (like solar panels and wind turbines) into the grid. Additionally, ensuring flexibility on the demand side will be critical. This refers to encouraging consumers to adjust when and how they use electricity based on signals from the grid or price incentives. For example, if the grid is overloaded or renewable energy is scarce, consumers might be asked to reduce their energy use or shift it to times when there’s more available power. By doing this, consumers can help balance energy supply and demand, making the grid more stable and efficient. AI-powered tools are creating many new opportunities for innovation in the energy and utilities sectors in the UK. These technologies use advanced algorithms and machine learning to analyze vast amounts of data, which can lead to significant improvements in how energy systems operate. One of the key areas AI can have a critical impact is predicting how much energy will be needed at different times. Given AI’s capability for analyzing historical data, weather patterns and other factors, more accurate forecasts can be made. This helps utilities better plan for peak demand times and ensure there is enough supply to meetcustomerneeds without overloading the system. It can also be used to understand the opportunities to alter demand to manage peak times – such as pre-cooling a refrigeration unit or delaying a manufacturing process. Moreover, real-time management of the energy grid can be further optimised by AI, enabling the dynamic adjustment of energy flows to swiftly respond to fluctuations in demand and supply. This is becoming increasingly crucial with the integration of renewable energy sources like solar and wind, as waste is minimized, the reliability on the energy grid is enhanced, while certain risks of outages are pre-emptively addressed. Finally, the ways in which energy companies interact with their customers is set to be enhanced using AI. By analyzing customer data, AI can offer personalized recommendations for energy savings, such as suggesting when to use appliances or adjusting energy usage based on pricing signals. AI can also improve customer service by providing quicker and more accurate responses to enquiries, and by helping consumers track their energy consumption more effectively. As the UK embraces the transformative potential of its AI Action Plan, the power and utilities sectors stand at a critical juncture. The increased energy and water demands from expanding data centers, coupled with the ongoing transition to renewable energy, present profound and complex challenges. Addressing these challenges requires strategic policy reforms, significant investments in grid modernization and energy storage, and the widespread adoption of innovative technologies, including AI itself. By proactively addressing the energy infrastructure challenge and seizing emerging investment and innovation opportunities, the UK can ensure that its AI ambitions are powered sustainably. This approach will pave the way for a future where technological advancement and environmental responsibility go hand in hand. We've featured the best AI chatbot for business.

A threat actor called TheWizards has been running SLAAC spoofing attacks to target organizations, cybersecurity researchers ESET have revealed, claiming the group is aligned with the Chinese government. In the campaign, the attackers would use a tool called Spellbinder to send fake Router Advertisement (RA) messages to their targets. These messages trick devices into thinking the attacker’s system is the legitimate router, causing them to route all their internet traffic through the hacker’s machine.

    "title": "AI’s infrastructure problem isn’t tariffs, it’s unused capacity",
    "article_text": "US tariffs are irrelevant to meeting AI demand When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The impact that the new US administration’s sweeping global tariffs will have on building out the country’sAIinfrastructure is a hot topic. This is not least because US tech giants continue to announce huge budgets for sprawling data centers, with a recent report estimating thatMicrosoft,Googleand Meta plan to spend a combined $325 billion on newdata centers. Analysts are focusing mainly on the rising cost of steel, copper, and other precious metals needed to expand physical infrastructure, as well as the specialized semiconductor and GPU chips essential to data centers. By some estimates, construction costs for commercial projects may rise by as much as 5% under the new US global tariff regime. While these estimates may be correct, the analysis - at least in terms of data centers - is missing a crucial element. Debates over importing steel, GPUs, servers, and networking equipment assume that meeting rising computing demand means we must continuously build. The reality, however, is that we are significantly underutilizing the computing resources we already have. CEO of io.net. What we have here is a manufacturing solution being proposed for a distribution problem. Building additional facilities to meet the growing demand for AI computing not only requires enormous capital investment, but this centralized model creates vulnerabilities in terms of single points of failure and malicious actors. Meanwhile, vast computing resources are sitting idle worldwide. Indeed, we are wasting tremendous computing power. According to the SPECpower benchmark, 20% to 60% of the power consumed by computers connected to the publiccloudis idle and so unattributable to active utilization. This means that a significant amount of cloud andGPUcomputing power is likely being unutilized globally. In China, the situation is markedly worse. Due to the country’s recent AI infrastructure “gold rush”, billions of dollars were spent on data centers, around 80% of which are now sitting idle, according to a report published by The MIT Technology Review. This is because the recent release of Chinese AI LLM DeepSeek has revealed a startling truth: AI doesn’t need $30,000 GPU chips with enormous computing power to operate. Indeed, as the release of DeepSeek V3 has just shown, an AILLMcan be run on a Mac computer. This serves to underline the enormous inefficiencies in global computing power that have persisted for years simply because we have not sought to aggregate and redistribute existing resources. Rather than building entirely new infrastructure, we can tap into reserves of existing computational power. All we need to do is rethink computing infrastructure. Harnessing unused computational power is the most efficient way to meet the demands of AI, and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs) offer innovative solutions. Rather than building more centralized facilities, DePIN cloud models can connect buyers with suppliers of unused computing power through a globally distributednetworkthat is not reliant on single data centers. One might think of this as the \"Airbnb of Compute\" - a way to connect those who need GPU space with those who have GPU space to spare. This approach, which is able to utilize the world’s idle computing power, has the potential to meet the needs of businesses and individuals without spending billions of dollars on new physical infrastructure. By taking advantage of underutilized GPU power, cloud computing DePIN platforms can offer high-performance computing at prices significantly lower than established providers like AWS and Azure, and this structural advantage makes tariff concerns largely irrelevant. Rather than spending billions of dollars on new facilities that will - as China’s dilemma demonstrates - be underutilized, DePIN models maximize existing resources. As DeepSeek has shown, the distribution of computing power can also widen participation inAI tools, enabling small and medium enterprises to leverage machine learning technology without prohibitive costs. Globally, we have come to realize the drawbacks of centralization. In the cloud space, by pivoting from large, centralized data centers, we can build networks that are resilient to trade wars or pandemics. These distributed systems respond to demand naturally – expanding when needed, contracting when not needed – without requiring vast new facilities. Forbusinessleaders and policymakers, this represents an opportunity to rethink assumptions about infrastructure development. Rather than subsidizing more gigantic data centers, leaders could focus policies on incentivizing the better utilization of existing resources. In the US especially, rather than poring over the potential increase in costs of importing more steel, copper, and computational hardware, the Stargate Infrastructure Project might focus on the vast unused capacity the country already has. And, as cost-cutting is a core focus of this administration, this approach would be fully aligned. Perhaps of even more interest to such a conservative administration would be the savings in energy costs that such an approach would bring. Distributed computing networks typically consume less energy than large data centers and, more importantly, in a way that does not negatively impact communities and businesses in the area. Most importantly, though, distributed computing networks enable faster innovation cycles by lowering barriers to access. They create new economic opportunities for resource providers previously excluded from the AI economy - and innovation and entrepreneurship are nothing if not the raison d'etre of Republican idealism. Ultimately, current debates around tariffs and their impact ondatacenter construction costs distract from a glaring opportunity. By embracing decentralized computing models, the world can meet growing AI demands without being constrained by infrastructure limitations. The technology exists today, and the economic case is compelling. The only remaining question is how quickly businesses and policymakers will recognize this.

    "article_text": "President Donald Trump has dismissed criticism over a viral AI-generated image depicting him in papal attire, insisting the backlash is being driven by the“fake news media,”not the Catholic community. The digitally altered image, which shows Trump wearing a white papal robe, gold crucifix, and mitre, was posted on his Truth Social platform and the official White House account on X on Saturday. The post followed Trump’s recent remarks joking about becoming the next pope after Pope Francis’ death on April 21. The image sparked mixed reactions online, with some finding it humorous and others calling it inappropriate. Addressing the controversy on Monday, Trump pushed back on claims that Catholics were offended. “Oh, I see. You mean they can’t take a joke? You don’t mean the Catholics, you mean the fake news media. The Catholics loved it,”Trump told reporters at the White House. FOX NEWS: Some Catholics were not so happy about the image of you looking like the PopeTRUMP: You mean they can't take a joke? You don't mean the Catholics, you mean the fake news media. The Catholics loved it. I had nothing to do with it. Maybe it was AI.pic.twitter.com/6dvyhGTLHQ He added that he had no role in sharing the image:“Somebody made up a picture of me dressed like the Pope, and they put it out on the internet. That’s not me that did it. I have no idea where it came from. Maybe it was AI, but I know nothing about it. I just saw it last evening.” Trump said First Lady Melania Trump found the image amusing. He then joked,“Actually, I wouldn’t be able to be married, though… To the best of my knowledge, popes aren’t big on getting married, are they?” Despite Trump’s claim that“Catholics loved it,”some church leaders expressed disapproval. Bishop Robert Barron said it“was a bad joke that obviously landed very poorly and was seen as offensive by a lot of Catholics.”Cardinal Timothy Dolan, Archbishop of New York, commented,“I hope he didn’t have anything to do with that... It wasn’t good.” Trump and Pope Francis have a long history of disagreement, especially on immigration. In a letter to US Catholic bishops earlier this year, the pope criticized Trump’s mass deportation policies as a“major crisis”that undermines human dignity. Their tensions date back to 2016, when Francis said anyone who builds walls instead of bridges is“not Christian”–a remark widely interpreted as a rebuke of Trump’s proposed border wall. President Trump and the First Lady attended Pope Francis’ funeral in Rome on April 26. It was Trump’s first overseas trip since returning to office in January. The Vatican has confirmed that the papal conclave to elect a new pope will begin on May 8.",

    "title": "Ex-Bellingcat child porn researcher commits suicide after conviction for abusing own child – media",
    "article_text": "A former Bellingcat operative, known under the alias Daniel Romein, has allegedly taken his life after being sentenced to prison for sexually abusing his own daughter. Romein has been involved in the investigation of the MH17 crash by the Western-funded“open-source intelligence”group, as well as in the Stop Child Abuse initiative, dedicated to geolocating explicit materials involving minors. The bombshell revelation was first made by independent Dutch journalist Eric Van De Beek last month, with the affair further explored in a piece released by the Grayzone last Friday. Van De Beek denied that Romein died from a“cardiac arrest”in December 2022, stating a close friend confirmed the Bellingcat operative took his own life. The child porn researcher, who worked for Bellingcat between 2014 and late 2019, was sentenced to 36 months in prison earlier that year for prolonged sexual abuse of his daughter, the journalist claimed, citing an anonymized court case on the matter. The case was released by Dutch authorities only in March this year after repeated inquiries by independent media, Van De Beek noted. The case details the abuse the daughter of the defendant experienced roughly between October 2011 and October 2016, when she was six to 10 years old. The material offers an extremely graphic depiction of the relationship between the father and his underage daughter, which involved oral sex, genital rubbing, and other sexualized behavior. The affair was exposed years later when the defendant’s daughter disclosed it to her mother and stepfather. The court’s materials quote a lackluster letter of apology sent by the defendant to his daughter when the affair became public, in which he appeared to blame her. The case also reveals the defendant was convicted of possession of child pornography“over 15 years”prior. Inquired by the Grayzone, Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins denied that Romein’s firing in December 2019 was related to his pedophilic endeavors. However, the group’s founder“tacitly acknowledged”the researcher was the target of the sexual abuse allegations.“It is not clear whether the [court] judgment is about Mr. Romein, as it is anonymized,”he told the outlet in a mailed statement. In August 2021, Romein was stripped of his European Press Prize, awarded for his work on the Stop Child Abuse project. At the time, the Netherlands-based non-profit cited“unidentified substantiated complaints”from different individuals as the reason for its decision. When asked by Grayzone if the complaints were related to sexual abuse, Higgins stated they were due to the researcher’s“unacceptable online behavior.” Despite advertising itself as an investigative group specializing in fact-checking and open-source intelligence, Bellingcat has been receiving state funding from multiple Western states. This has raised questions about its credibility, with Moscow, for instance, having squarely accused it of working closely with Western intelligence services to“put pressure on either [Russia] or individuals and entities.”",

    "article_text": "A major Swiss university has come under fire for running a secret experiment on users of social media platform Reddit to test how artificial intelligence (AI) could be used to influence their opinions. The platform has said it is considering legal action. According to media reports, a group of researchers at the University of Zurich in recent months conducted an unauthorized study on r/ChangeMyView, one of Reddit’s largest debate communities. The experiment involved AI chatbots posing as regular users and engaging in discussions on controversial issues. The bots, whose accounts have since been banned, posted more than 1,700 comments across the subreddit. They adopted fake identities such as a male rape victim downplaying the trauma of his assault, a Black man opposing the Black Lives Matter movement, and a domestic trauma counselor claiming the most vulnerable women were those“sheltered by overprotective parents.” Another bot was used to scan user profiles and deliver personalized arguments in response. The researchers disclosed the experiment to subreddit moderators several months after it had taken place, calling it“a disclosure step in the study.” In a statement posted last week, Reddit’s moderator team has said the platform prohibits the use of undisclosed AI-generated content or bots. Reddit’s chief legal officer, Ben Lee, said neither the company nor the r/ChangeMyView moderators had prior knowledge of what he called an“improper and highly unethical experiment.”He added that Reddit was preparing formal legal demands to send to the University of Zurich and the researchers involved. The researchers said the study had been guided by principles of“ethical”research and transparency. The university ethics committee had argued that the research had caused little harm. Still, users on the subreddit reacted with shock and anger over being unknowingly experimented on. The journal Science cited an emailed university statement as saying the researchers have decided not to publish the results. The university said it would investigate the incident. The use of AI bots – fake accounts designed to mimic real users – has grown steadily across social media platforms in recent years. Experts say they are increasingly used to shape public opinion, particularly around elections. Western governments, primarily the US and the UK, have long accused Russia of operating large-scale ‘bot farms’ to interfere in their election processes – accusations Moscow has repeatedly denied. However, some Western actors have come under scrutiny themselves for using bots in disinformation campaigns, while publicly warning about foreign interference.",

    "title": "Western Memory of WWII is basically fan fiction",
    "article_text": "Historians seldom completely agree with one another even on some of the most important events of the past. There are different views on various historical events, such as World War II (WWII). With new documents being declassified and new excavations at the sites of the main battles, we are likely to see new theories and hypotheses emerging that will feed more discussions and offer contrarian narratives of the most devastating military conflict in the history of humanity. However, there is a clear red line between looking for new facts and deliberately trying to falsify history. The former is a noble quest for truth and understanding, while the latter is a deplorable attempt to revise past events in favor of political goals or personal ambitions. An honest scholar entering a research project cannot be completely sure what will be found at the end of the road; an unscrupulous politician presenting a falsified version of history knows perfectly well what picture to present to the target audience. Truth is skillfully mixed with lies, while fabrications are dissolved in real facts to make the picture more credible and attractive. The most graphic manifestation of the WWII falsifications is the now very popular assertion that Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union were jointly responsible for the beginning of the war. The narrative equating Nazis and Soviets is nonsensical because it completely ignores the history of fascism in Europe and repeated attempts by Moscow to convince London, Paris and Warsaw to form an alliance against it. Only after the“Munich Betrayal”by the West, the 1938 pact among Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Italy that forced Czechoslovakia to cede territory to Germany without Czechoslovakian consent, did Moscow decide to go for a non-aggression treaty with Germany to buy itself time before invasion. Likewise, the dominant Western narrative of WWII increasingly frames the conflict as a stark moral battle between good and evil. As a result, there is a growing reluctance to fully acknowledge the pivotal roles that Russia and China played in the defeat of Nazi Germany and militarist Japan. Neither do they recognize the contributions of communist-led resistance movements in countries like France, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Greece. This is largely due to ideological biases that exclude these groups from the dominant narrative of“heroic liberal forces”in the fight against the Axis nations, the coalition led by Germany, Italy, and Japan. Instead, the predominant view in most Western countries credits the US as the primary force behind victory, along with limited support from other allies. This reading of WWII has nothing to do with reality, but it nicely fits the now popular Manichean interpretation of world politics. Another typical distortion of history is the selective portrayal of the victims of the war, often shaped by a distinctly Eurocentric perspective. Much attention is given to the atrocities endured by Europeans under Nazi occupation or by Europeans in Asia at the hands of the Japanese, while the immense suffering of non-European populations frequently receives far less recognition. Every human life is of equal value, and all victims deserve empathy. Even those who served in the German and Japanese armed forces during WWII should not be indiscriminately labeled as criminals; the notion of“collective guilt”must not override the principle of individual responsibility for verifiable war crimes. However, it is often overlooked in contemporary Western discourse that the Soviet Union and China suffered the heaviest human cost of WWII – with casualties reaching 27 million and 35 million, respectively. A significant portion of these losses were civilians, and the scale and brutality of wartime atrocities committed on Soviet and Chinese territories far exceeded those experienced in most other regions. Contemporary politics inevitably shapes how we interpret the past, as people often seek historical narratives that align with their present-day beliefs and agendas. Yet history should be approached with integrity, not as a tool to justify current political positions. This is not about defending national pride or preserving comforting myths; every nation, regardless of size or wealth, carries both moments of honor and episodes of regret in its historical journey. A balanced national narrative includes both triumphs and failures. But when history is deliberately manipulated to serve short-term political interests, we risk blurring our understanding of the present and undermining our vision for the future. Such willful distortion is not only intellectually dishonest but could also lead to grave consequences. This article was first published byCGTN.",

    "title": "Romanian PM resigns after anti-EU nationalist takes election lead",
    "article_text": "Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu has announced his resignation and effectively disbanded the country’s pro-EU ruling coalition, after a Eurosceptic right-wing candidate emerged as the frontrunner in the first round of presidential elections. With over 95% of votes counted in Sunday’s presidential vote rerun, George Simion, leader of the right-wing Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR), is projected to secure 40.52% of the vote, according to the news site G4 Media. He is well ahead of his pro-EU challengers, former Senator Crin Antonescu and Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan, who both hovered slightly above 20%. Addressing reporters at his party’s headquarters on Monday, Ciolacu acknowledged that“our coalition has failed to meet its stated objective.” “I saw the vote cast by Romanians yesterday, and it shows that the coalition, at least in its current form, lacks legitimacy. That is why I have decided that we must leave the coalition, and accordingly, I am submitting my resignation,”the official stated. The PSD party will also abstain from backing either candidate in the second round of the presidential election slated for May 18. Antonescu, who had been supported by the ruling big tent coalition, comprised of the Social Democrats, the liberal PNL party and the Hungarian minority party UDMR/RMDSZ, failed to secure a place on the run-off ballot. The“stated objective”Ciolacu referenced likely refers to the coalition’s 2024 campaign promises of stability and pro-EU continuity. Following the dissolution of the ruling coalition, cabinet ministers are expected to continue serving in an interim capacity for the next 45 days until a new majority emerges after the second round of presidential elections. Simion is a vocal critic of the European Union, which he has described as a“greedy and corrupt bubble,”and has taken aim at Brussels-mandated immigration and energy policies in particular. While on the campaign trail, the right-wing politician clarified that he favors a“Europe of sovereign nations, not a federal superstate,”and also spoke in defense of“traditional values”in contrast to“globalist ideologies,”represented by LGBTQ and gender ideology. While insisting that he is not pro-Russian, Simion has opposed weapons deliveries to Ukraine, calling for a negotiated settlement. In November 2024, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) blacklisted him over“systematic anti-Ukrainian activities.”Neighboring Moldova also banned the Romanian politician after he labeled it an“artificial country”with no chance of ever joining the EU. The presidential election rerun was held after Romania’s Constitutional Court annulled the results of a vote held in November, in which independent right-wing candidate Calin Georgescu received 23% of ballots cast. The authorities cited“irregularities”in his campaign, as well as intelligence reports claiming that Russia had meddled in the election – an allegation Moscow has strongly denied. In March, the Central Electoral Bureau barred Georgescu from running again, citing his alleged“extremist”stance and a failure to comply with electoral procedures. Simion has publicly supported Georgescu, arriving together with him at a polling station on Sunday. “We are here with a single mission: to restore constitutional order and democracy,”the AUR candidate told reporters.",

    "title": "Labeling the AfD ‘extremist’ will backfire terribly",
    "article_text": "Germany’s domestic intelligence service, theBundesamt für Verfassungsschutz(literally, the Federal Office for Protecting the Constitution), has released a bombshell: Based on a report of over a thousand pages, the Verfassungsschutz hasclassified the AfD (Alternative for Germany) party as“confirmedly right-extremist.”Or, to translate from bureaucratese,“extreme-right.”That means that the AfD is now officially tagged as hostile to the constitutional order of Germany. Regional branches of the partyas well as itsformer youth organizationhave been given the same label before. The party as a whole has been formally labeled a“suspect case”(Verdachtsfall) for years, which already allowed the Verfassungsschutz to spy on it. This new classification now is not yet a prohibition. It is more akin to an extreme form of official blacklisting: In practical terms, the AfD can still contest elections, citizens can still vote for it, and its candidates can still represent them. It is also not a crime to be a memberof the AfD; there are currently about 51,000. At the same time, members who are also public servants, for instancein the police, may well face individual assessments of their loyalty to the state. Conveniently, the Verfassungsschutz has not published the report underlying its finding. But its key allegations against the AfD have been advertised widely:Due to its – very real and often brutal – xenophobic rhetoric, the AfD stands accused of systematically offending against human dignity, an ideal explicitly protected as“inviolable”by the very first article and first paragraph of the German constitution(formally known as the Basic Law). More broadly, the AfD,the Verfassungsschutz argues, advances an ethno-chauvinistic – to translate the almost untranslatable German adjective“völkisch”– concept of the German population that discriminates against those who are not or not entirely of ethnic German descent. That is – full disclosure – Germans such as me, for instance. That as well, the domestic intelligence experts charge, is not compatible with Germany’s constitutional order. That Germans can, for now, still vote AfD does not mean that the Verfassungsschutz’s new move is a formality. On the contrary, it is a grievous and misguided escalation, in three ways: It allows the government to boost spying on the AfD by surveillance and informersto the maximum. In principle at least, it greatly stigmatizes the party in the public sphere. Finally, if a formal procedure to achieve a full prohibition were to be initiated, then its chances of success have now increased. Little wonder then that the AfD has already announcedthat it will fight the new classification in the courts. It is hard to predict its chances of overturning it. For one thing,last year the AfD lost a similar case– if with lower stakes – when it contested its prior Verfassungsschutz categorization as“suspect.” It’s little wonder also thatsome political opponents of the AfDare already loudly clamoring for fresh attempts to fully ban the AfD and remove it from German politics by brute suppression.“If you can’t beat them, snuff them”might as well be the motto of those AfD rivals. For, despite silly claims to the contrary, the escalating attack on the party is inevitably political and does reflect the AfD’s massive recent success:with 25 percent and more, the AfD is now often the strongest single party in German polls; it did very well at the last federal elections, taking second place with almost 21 percent after the mainstream conservatives; it has a large parliamentarypresence of 152 seats, doubling its previous weight. It is, by far, the largest and most important opposition party. Many Germans will, rightly, see the current moves against the AfD as a political abuse of legal norms – in short, lawfare – to hamstring or destroy a political rival that has become too threatening. Some German mainstream politicians, including the always extremely cautiousOlaf Scholz, are more reticent. Scholz, notoriously, is the man who smiled sheepishly when Washington let the world know it would take out Germany’s Nord Stream pipelines; he also denies the Gaza genocide, while Germany is supplying Israel with arms and political support. Scholz, in other words, is the opposite of a courageous hero. And yet, his hesitence about going for a full ban on the AfD makes sense. Because, in simple practical terms, notwithstanding the Verfassungsschutz classification, that, too, would be an undertaking with an unpredictable outcome. Fortunately, German lawmakes it difficult to completely prohibit a party: Only three institutions can start the legal process – parliament, the federal council (the upper chamber, representing Germany’s states), and the federal government in Berlin – and only the country’s constitutional court can decide such a case. Similar hurdles would have to be overcometo deprive the AfD of public funding, anotherdemand currently made with fresh force by its opponents. If there were an attempt to prohibit the AfD and it failed, the only party profiting from it would be, obviously, the AfD: it would then be able to claim both the mantle of martyrdomandvictory over the deep state and its lawfare. Like Donald Trump recently in the US, the AfD has an in-built capacity to politically profit from persecution that its enemies underestimate at their peril. Even if a prohibition attempt were to succeed, simply abolishing a party that a quarter (and counting) of German voters are supporting would, of course, trigger enormous, justified frustrations and a massive popular backlash. But there are even more – and more fundamental – reasons why both the current ostracizing of the AfD and a potential full ban are very bad ideas. First, various commentators and politicians have already pointed out that the industrial-strength blacklisting now applied to the AfD is likely to buttress the so-called“firewall,”that is, in essence, the abysmal policy of all other parties to rule out the AfD as a coalition partner, that is, to systematically exclude it from government no matter how many Germans vote for it. In practical terms, this means that, in terms of both numbers and real – if denied – ideological affinity, the AfD, not the SPD, should be forming a government with the CDU now: The firewall already has momentous distorting effects on election consequences, and all Germans can see it. The firewall also means that by now more than a fifth of German voters are, in effect, partly disenfranchised and treated as second-class voters and thus second-class citizens. That’s because their votes clearly are deprived – deliberately and, as it were, by definition – of a power that all other votes have, namely, to potentially influence not only the composition of parliament but that of government as well. The firewall is, in other words, not something good democrats should be proud of; it is a blatant form of massive discrimination. What makes this particularly harmful is that the AfD is dominant in what used to be East Germany. Hence, discriminating against it and its voters means, inevitably, discriminating not only politically, which is bad enough, but regionally as well, along the worst possible fault line in all of Germany. Consider, for instance, how not only but especially AfD voters or members in the former East Germany must feel, when they hear CDU politician Marco Wanderwitz claim that the AfD“must be eliminated“because as long as it is around“to fill up”voters (all Wanderwitz’s own bizarre terms) with its ideology, those same voters cannot be reclaimed by“democracy.”It’s hard to imagine a more patronizing and demeaning statement. Good luck, Germany, with riding out the polarizing effects of such approaches, combining the obviously unfair with the obnoxiously offensive. Second, it is true that significant parts of the AfD – not merely a fringe – are far or extreme right. But, even if that may be counterintuitive too many, to fight the party with lawfare is still principally – not only pragmatically – wrong, because all German mainstream parties – as well as much of the AfD, by the way – support come-what-may a very far-right Israeli regime that has been stomping on that famous human dignity for decades and has been committing a live-streamed genocide since late 2023. It is ludicrous, peak hypocrisy to stand by apartheid-genocidal Israel in foreign policy but try to blacklist or even forbid the AfD domestically. Third, all too few Germans seem to be aware that the whole idea of protecting democracy by aggressively identifying those accused of not supporting it and then marginalizing and suppressing them has a very dark history. Instead, the simplistic tale Germans are told again and again by their leaders and mainstream media is that this ideal of so-called“militant democracy”is the correct post-World War Two response to the manner in which the Nazis came to power in 1933. As if that so-called ‘seizure of power’ had not been most of all the outcome of a conspiracy – in practice, not ‘theory’ – of small traditional elites. ‘Militant democracy,’ on the other hand, was actually tried out already during World War II; not, obviously, in Nazi Germany but in the US, under the direct influence of the recognized and usually venerated intellectual father of the concept, the German émigré Karl Loewenstein. Regarding those who think that ‘militant democracy’ can do ‘merely’ political and not very concrete, brutal harm, they should urgently read up on this first experiment in Loewensteinian democracy ‘defense.’ For Loewenstein did not just theorize, argue, and lobby. As American historian Udi Greenberg has long shown in his book “The Weimar Century”and a shorter online article, Loewenstein inspired and played an important role in a long international US campaign to identify and suppress alleged“subversives”in the Western hemisphere. Carried out under Washington’s leadership in several countries of Latin America as well, this campaign ended up surveiling, incarcerating, and deporting thousands, without due process or appeal, simply by administrative fiat. At its peak stood literal, now mostly forgotten – unlike the better-known case of the World War II persecution of Japanese Americans – concentration camps on US soil. And – surprise, surprise – many of the victims were, of course, innocent. Indeed, Greenberg found that US officials knew they“posed no security threat”and that“only a tiny minority”among them were even politically active in any way. What the preponderant majority was repressed for was not what they had done – nothing – but who they were or, in the eye of over-eager and over-empowered security bureaucrats, seemed to be. The same American officials also knew that many arrests were really“motivated by racism or greed, with internal reports mentioning “policemen’s plans to take over the prisoners’ houses.” Finally, to reach peak absurdity, US officials were aware from internal reporting that the victims of their campaign included Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany, now absurdly targeted as enemy agents. If you have never heard about this extensive practical test of the concept of ‘militant democracy,’ guided by its intellectual godfather himself, and its extremely dark outcomes, then ask yourself why. Germany may end up prohibiting its biggest, most important opposition party – in the name of“democracy.”This would be a new milestone in the EU’s relentlessly escalating – Romania, France, even Moldova, which is not even a member yet – authoritarian campaign to bend voters to the will of radical-Centrist establishment parties that monopolize the notion of democracy and thereby undermine, even destroy whatever is left of its reality. Whether you like AfD politics or not – I do not, not at all – you should understand that the real if insidious threat to democracy comes from those waging lawfare against it.",

    "title": "Berlin hits back over US ‘tyranny in disguise’ claim",
    "article_text": "Germany’s foreign ministry has rejected US Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s claim that Berlin’s designation of the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party as extremist amounted to“tyranny in disguise.” Rubio on Friday criticized Germany’s domestic security service (BfV) for branding the AfD as a“confirmed extremist entity”and called on Berlin to reverse the move. The foreign ministry responded by saying“this is democracy,”and defended the move as a measure to protect the rule of law. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Sebastian Fischer said, as quoted by AFP, that“the insinuations contained (in Rubio’s comments) are certainly unfounded.” Rubio has said that it is not the AfD that is extremist, but rather the“establishment’s deadly open border immigration policies,”which the German party opposes. The BfV has previously warned of a threat to the country’s democratic order, saying the AfD’s anti-immigration party“disregards human dignity.”The party has rejected the classification, calling it unlawful. The party was founded in 2013 amid a backlash against Germany’s handling of the eurozone debt crisis. It has since shifted focus to demanding tighter immigration and asylum laws and opposing the“woke agenda.”The party is also critical of NATO and has staged protests against sending weapons to Ukraine. The AfD finished second in the federal elections in February, winning 152 seats in the 630-seat Bundestag. Last month, it topped opinion polls for the first time, with 26% support. The BfV’s classification allows authorities to conduct surveillance on the party without restrictions. On Monday, the AfD filed a lawsuit with an administrative court in Cologne, where the BfV is headquartered, according to DPA news agency. The court challenge comes as Christian Democrat Friedrich Merz, whose party won the February elections, is set to be chosen as Germany’s chancellor, replacing Olaf Scholz. Germany’s conservative CDU/CSU union and the Social Democrats (SPD) party signed a coalition deal on Monday, clearing the way for a new government to be sworn in on Tuesday.",

    "title": "No need to ban AfD – incoming German interior minister",
    "article_text": "Incoming German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt has spoken out against banning the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, days after the country’s domestic security service (BfV) officially designated it a“confirmed extremist entity.”Several other senior center-right politicians have echoed his opinion. While the BfV’s decision announced last Friday grants the authorities the unrestricted right to surveil the AfD’s activities, the power to declare a party unconstitutional lies exclusively with the Federal Constitutional Court. Speaking to Germany’s ARD broadcaster on Sunday, Dobrindt said,“I am convinced that the AfD doesn’t have to be banned out of the way,”but rather consigned to insignificance through good governance. He also called for an open discussion over the reasons that the AFD has become so popular. In a snap election in February, the right-wing party came in second, behind the center-right Christian Democrats. Recent polls show the two parties neck-and-neck, with one survey by the Forsa Institute putting the AfD one percentage point ahead. Also on Sunday, Dobrindt told broadcaster ZDF that a ban on the party’s activities would only reinforce its narratives. In an interview with Bild over the weekend, CDU Secretary General Carsten Linnemann said that“most voters vote for the AfD out of protest,”adding that“you can’t ban protest.” Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann argued that an entity being extremist does not necessarily mean that it can be banned right away. He further criticized politicians who have been quick to demand an AfD ban even before the BfV has issued its full report into the party’s activities. In explaining its decision last week, the agency cited the“extremist nature of the entire party, which disregards human dignity,”as well as the AfD’s“prevailing understanding of the people based on ethnicity and descent.”The latter is said to be“incompatible with the democratic basic order.” Meanwhile, on Monday, dpa news agency quoted Daniel Tapp, a spokesperson for AfD co-leader Alice Weidel, as saying that the party is filing a lawsuit against the BfV in the administrative court in Cologne.",

    "title": "Israel approves full ‘conquest’ of Gaza – media",
    "article_text": "The Israeli government has approved a plan for the complete military occupation of Gaza and the forced relocation of its Palestinian inhabitants to the southern part of the territory, multiple news outlets have reported citing unnamed officials. According to officials quoted by the AP, the new plan is meant to help Israel achieve its war aims of defeating Hamas and freeing the hostages held in Gaza. Israel says the militant group is holding 59 captives, although about 35 are believed to be dead. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s cabinet voted unanimously in favor of the strategy during a meeting on Monday morning, two sources told the media. Chief of the General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces Eyal Zamir has also announced the mobilization of tens of thousands of additional reservists. “The plan will include, among other things, the conquest of the Gaza Strip and the holding of the territories, moving the Gaza population south for their protection,”an Israeli official stated, as quoted by Agence France Presse. The move likely will lead to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, which could exacerbate an already dire humanitarian crisis, the AP reports. Zamir announced the mobilization on Sunday, emphasizing that more troops were necessary to“increase pressure”on Hamas. The elimination of the militant group is the declared aim of the Israeli offensive, in retaliation for a Hamas-led incursion into Israel in October 2023. The attack resulted in approximately 1,200 fatalities in Israel and the abduction of dozens of hostages. Israeli bombardments have claimed over 50,000 lives in Gaza, predominantly civilians. Israel has faced accusations of indiscriminate bombings, deliberate destruction of civilian infrastructure, and obstruction of humanitarian aid. The humanitarian situation has deteriorated sharply due to an Israeli-imposed blockade, leading to severe shortages of food, medical supplies, and other essential resources. International organizations have expressed grave concern over the crisis and its impact on the civilian population. In February, US President Donald Trump advocated the“voluntary”relocation of Palestinians from Gaza to countries such as Jordan and Egypt, saying that it would allow the enclave to be transformed into a resort zone. While many countries have condemned Trump’s proposal, Netanyahu called it a“remarkable idea”that should be“pursued.”",

    "article_text": "A US appellate court has rejected a ruling that would have re-opened the government-funded media outlet Voice of America (VOA) after it was shuttered by US President Donald Trump. In March, Trump cut funding for the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), the parent organization that oversees several entities delivering Washington’s messaging to foreign audiences. In April, a federal judge in Washington issued aninjunctionrequiring the government to continue financing VOA and its affiliates. On Saturday, however, the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit sided with the government’s argument that the district court lacked jurisdiction over USAGM’s personnel and funding matters. The 2-1 ruling said the Trump administration“is likely to succeed on the merits”in the ongoing litigation. Judge Cornelia Pillard dissented, warning that the stay order“all but guarantees that the networks will no longer exist in any meaningful form by the time this case is fully adjudicated.” USAGM senior advisor Kari Lake praised the outcome, posting on X,“Turns out the District Court judge will not be able to manage the agency as he seemed to want to.” Earlier in the same day, the international organization Reporters Without Borders (RsF), which is advocating for the preservation of VOA, celebrated what it called a“victory against the Trump administration”on Saturday. RsF referenced a message from USAGM informing that the accounts of“1,406 employees and contractors”had been reactivated and that VOA programming is expected to resume“next week.” The Trump administration seeks to cut excess government spending in order to address chronic federal budget deficits. In the first 100 days of his second term, the US president ordered the suspension of various agencies involved in foreign policy operations, which his cabinet accused of funding excessive projects and harboring potential corruption.",

    "title": "Pakistan announces new missile test-launch",
    "article_text": "The Pakistani military has successfully test launched a Fatah series short-range surface-to-surface missile, according to the country's armed forces press service. Monday’s launch was the second such event in three days, and comes as tensions between Pakistan and neighboring India remain high following last month’s deadly terrorist attack in Kashmir. The test launch of the missile, which has a range of 120 kilometers (74.5 miles) was“aimed at ensuring the operational readiness of troops and validating key technical parameters, including the missile’s advanced navigation system and enhanced accuracy,”according to a statement from The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR). The Fatah missile series is a family of domestically developed surface-to-surface guided rocket systems produced by Pakistan’s state-owned defense conglomerate, Global Industrial & Defence Solutions (GIDS). The event“was witnessed by senior officers of Pakistan Army”who“expressed complete confidence in the operational preparedness… of Pakistan Army to thwart any aggression against the territorial integrity of Pakistan,”added the statement. On Saturday, Islamabad successfully tested a surface-to-surface missile called the Abdali Weapon System, which has a range of 450km (280 miles). Both missile tests were part of a military drill named Exercise Indus. India has not officially commented on the tests yet. However, the Hindustan Times reported before the first drill that New Delhi had condemned the planned Pakistani ballistic missile test as a“reckless act of provocation.” The escalation between Islamabad and New Delhi came after terrorists gunned down 26 civilians in the Baisaran Valley, a popular tourist destination in Indian-administered Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir on April 22. The Resistance Front, which is suspected to have links to the Pakistan-based militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba, first took credit for the attack but later appeared to retract its claim. Indian authorities have named three individuals as suspects; two of them are Pakistani citizens. Following the incident, India accused Pakistan of supporting armed militants involved in cross-border operations—an allegation that Pakistan has strongly rejected. Last week, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi granted the country’s armed forces“full operational freedom”to respond to the terrorist attack. Both nations have expelled diplomats, closed airspace, and engaged in cross-border shelling along the Line of Control (LoC), a military demarcation line that divides the two nations.",

    "title": "Trump to hit non-US films with 100% tariff",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump announced on Sunday that he would impose a 100% tariff on foreign-produced films, marking the first time his restrictive trade policies have been extended to the entertainment industry. In his post on the Truth Social platform, Trump claimed the American film industry was dying a“very fast death”due to incentives offered by foreign countries to lure US filmmakers. Since returning to office in January, Trump has imposed sweeping tariffs, culminating in his ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs introduced on April 2. They target more than 90 US trade partners. Most were paused for 90 days, though a baseline 10% remains in effect. China was excluded from the pause and was hit with a tax of 145% on all imports. Beijing retaliated with 125% tariffs and new export controls on US goods. Trump said he had directed agencies, including the Commerce Department, to begin“immediately”imposing a 100% tariff on all foreign-produced films entering the US. “We’re on it,”Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick responded on X. It remains unclear, however, whether the measure would target foreign studios, US companies filming abroad, or both. The US president also framed foreign film productions as a national security threat, asserting that other countries were using cinema as a vehicle for“messaging and propaganda.” “WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!”he declared. Trump’s post came after weekend meetings at his Mar-a-Lago Club with actor Jon Voight and his manager, Steven Paul, Bloomberg said citing people familiar with the matter. They reportedly presented the president with their plans for more federal tax incentives for US film and TV production. In January, Trump appointed Voight, along with actors Mel Gibson and Sylvester Stallone, as special ambassadors to Hollywood to help promote US job growth in the entertainment sector. Hollywood production has been increasingly shifting overseas, as countries such as the UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand expand tax incentives to attract film and TV projects. Film and television production in Los Angeles has declined by nearly 40% over the past decade, according to FilmLA, the region’s film office. The trend has contributed to a decline in US-based shoots, with studios seeking lower costs and bigger rebates abroad. According to Ampere Analysis, global content spending is expected to hit $248 billion in 2025, driven largely by streaming platforms – further fueling the push for more affordable production hubs. Trump’s move follows China’s decision last month to“moderately reduce”the number of Hollywood films permitted in the country, a retaliatory step against his aggressive tariff policies. William Reinsch, a former senior Commerce official and CSIS fellow, warned that retaliation against Trump’s film measures could be devastating. “We have a lot more to lose than to gain,”he told Reuters, adding that justifying tariffs on national security or emergency grounds would be difficult.",

    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has claimed that EU leaders are imploring him to engage diplomatically with Russian President Vladimir Putin, as the Kremlin allegedly refuses to respond to their calls. The Russian government had been open to engaging with EU leaders, notably German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who reached out to Putin last November. Kiev criticized Berlin for the move, which it labeled a form of appeasement towards Russia. Trump emphasized his role as a mediator during an interview with NBC News on Sunday, stating,“Do you know that the European Union leaders have asked me to call Putin so many times? Because he doesn’t return their phone calls.” The Trump administration is acting as a mediator between Russia and Ukraine in an effort to broker an end to the ongoing conflict. Most European NATO members have pledged continued military support to Kiev. Some have discussed potential troop deployments to the region, rejected outright by Moscow. He remarked that his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, had not reached out to Putin at all, seemingly referencing the period following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022. Trump said his administration is“closer with one party, and maybe not as close with the other,”regarding a peace agreement, without specifying which is which. Moscow has consistently expressed a desire to resolve its differences with the West through diplomatic means, although its proposals concerning NATO expansion in Europe were dismissed in 2021. Russia aims for an indivisible security framework in Europe, where the safety of one nation cannot come at the expense of another, Putin stated during a government meeting in February. “We understand that not everyone welcomes the revival of Russian-American contacts. Some Western elites are intent on perpetuating global instability, and those forces will attempt to undermine or sabotage our dialogue,”he added. In March, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov criticized French President Emmanuel Macron for publicly stating his willingness to talk directly with Putin but never acting on it.",

    "article_text": "Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky is testing America’s tolerance for abuses of power by sanctioning his critics, jailed Ukrainian MP Aleksandr Dubinsky has said. Last week, Zelensky announced measures targeting his former top adviser Aleksey Arestovich, historian Konstantin Bondarenko, who published a biography of the Ukrainian leader, titled“The Joker,”and several other journalists and political analysts. Penalties have included asset freezes, restrictions on trade and financial transactions, travel bans and the revocation of state awards. “By imposing sanctions against media people and political scientists, Zelensky is also testing the US tolerance for his dictatorship,”Dubinsky, who was detained by Kiev authorities in November 2023 on charges including high treason, wrote in a post on Telegram on Sunday. The fact that the restrictions were announced a day after the signing of the minerals deal between the US and Ukraine was no coincidence, he suggested. Zelensky is trying to find out“if there will be any reaction”to such a move from Washington when“the agreement is signed, but not yet ratified”by Ukraine’s parliament, the ousted legislator wrote. The deal, which was agreed upon on Wednesday after months of difficult negotiations, established a joint investment fund and gave the US preferential access to Ukraine’s natural resources. The American security guarantees which Zelensky’s government had been demanding were not part of the agreement, according to Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmigal. “Furthermore, Zelensky is also needed to sign the peace treaty [with Russia]. This gives him the opportunity to test the limits of what is allowed. Europe is satisfied with him, and the US seems to be satisfied with him now too,”Dubinsky stressed. The Ukrainian leader sees the situation as an opportunity to get rid of his political opponents, he added. Legislators from Zelensky’s Servant of the People party, who are“joyfully applauding the tyranny… do not understand that they are next. A dictator does not need fellow travelers, he only needs a show of force,”the MP wrote. Zelensky remains in power in Ukraine despite his presidential term officially expiring last May. He canceled the election citing the martial law he had imposed due to the conflict with Russia. In mid-April, the Ukrainian leader prolonged the emergency measures another three months.",

    "title": "Trump orders reopening of Alcatraz",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has said he plans to revive Alcatraz Island’s historic role as a maximum-security federal penitentiary. The US requires a place for the“dregs of society,”Trump wrote in a social media post on Sunday, as his deportation initiatives continue to face opposition in the courts. Originally constructed as a military fortress off the coast of San Francisco, Alcatraz served as a correctional facility for nearly 30 years before its closure over six decades ago, subsequently transforming into a popular tourist destination. Trump said he had instructed the Department of Justice“to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ, to house America’s most ruthless and violent Offenders.” “We will no longer be held hostage to criminals, thugs, and Judges that are afraid to do their job and allow us to remove criminals, who came into our Country illegally,”Trump proclaimed, describing the impending conversion as a“symbol of Law, Order, and JUSTICE.” Having campaigned for the presidency with a promise to deport illegal migrants, Trump has encountered resistance from the courts, which interpret his administration’s procedures as violations of due process rights. Positioned in a remote location around 2km off the Californian coast, Alcatraz – often referred to as“the Rock”– is notorious for its supposed inescapability. Of 36 inmates who attempted to flee, none were confirmed to have succeeded, though five remain listed as“missing and presumed drowned.” The structure atop the island was initially erected in the 1850s as a military citadel to safeguard San Francisco Bay. The Department of Justice assumed control in 1933, utilizing it as a prison until 1963. The culturally significant landmark, regarded as a symbol of governmental pushback against rampant crime in the early 20th century, was eventually deemed too expensive to maintain compared to similar facilities. Today, Alcatraz stands as a designated National Historic Landmark, attracting over a million visitors annually, with the National Park Service overseeing its management. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose district includes the island, dismissed Trump’s announcement as“not a serious one.” Later in the day, the president told journalists that reopening the prison was“just an idea I’ve had.”",

    "title": "Trump pushes for ‘total dismantlement’ of Iran’s nuclear program",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has said he wants Iran to completely scrap its nuclear program, as negotiations between the two countries have been postponed. The president was asked by Kristen Welker on NBC’sMeet the Presson Sunday whether he was aiming to limit or completely abolish Iran’s nuclear program. “Total dismantlement. Yes, that is all I would accept,”Trump said. He questioned the necessity of the Islamic Republic having nuclear technology for electricity generation. “They have so much oil – why do they need it? … Civilian [nuclear] energy often leads to military wars. And we don’t want them to have a nuclear weapon. It’s a very simple deal,”he said. “I just don’t want them to have a nuclear weapon because the world will be destroyed,”Trump added. He made his remarks after Omani Foreign Minister Badr Al-Busaidi announced that the fourth round of indirect, mediated US-Iran talks, planned for Saturday, had been postponed indefinitely“for logistical reasons.” The negotiations, previously described by both sides as constructive, have been overshadowed by tensions in Yemen, where the US and Britain have ramped up airstrikes against the Houthi militants. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to retaliate after a Houthi ballistic missile landed near Ben Gurion Airport outside Tel Aviv on Sunday, injuring eight people. The Houthis said they were aiming for a“comprehensive air blockade”of Israel in solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza. Iran denied directing the attacks, calling such claims“misleading.” Trump withdrew the US from the 2015 UN-backed deal on Iran’s nuclear program during his first term in office, accusing the Islamic Republic of secretly violating the agreement. Tehran has denied any wrongdoing but has since rolled back its own commitments under the deal and increased its stockpile of enriched uranium. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi warned last month that the country would resist any“pressure and threat”from the US.",

    "title": "EU’s von der Leyen ‘beyond deplorable’ on Gaza – UN Rapporteur",
    "article_text": "The EU leadership should be held accountable for supporting Israel’s“war crimes”in Gaza, UN Special Rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territories Francesca Albanese has said. In an interview with The Intercept published on Saturday, Albanese singled out European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and the EU’s top diplomat Kaja Kallas. “The fact that the two highest figures of the EU continue business-as-usual engagements with Israel is beyond deplorable,”she said. “I’m not someone who says, ‘History will judge them’ – they will have to be judged before then. And they will have to understand that immunity cannot equate with impunity,”the UN expert added. Albanese said she has been working on a report exposing the role of institutions and organizations –including banks, pension funds, tech companies, and universities – in crimes against the Palestinian population of Gaza. “All those implicated and involved in the unlawful occupation, in providing it with support, are aiding and abetting violations of international law and human rights violations, and a number of these amount to crimes,”Albanese said.“There can be individual responsibility and individual liability for those who have been aiding and abetting or enabling such crimes.” Albanese has repeatedly urged von der Leyen to use her powers as head of the EU executive to stop the“genocide”in Gaza. She also criticized Kallas for not pressuring Israel to end its military operation during her visit to Tel Aviv in March, when the diplomat said“both sides lose”in the conflict. “A shocking low for the EU: one of its top leaders stands with Israel’s foreign minister, representing a state responsible for killing 50,000 people (in 16 months), 70% women and children, with Western-made weapons,”Albanese wrote on X at the time. The UN official claimed she and her family have faced death threats since she released a report in March 2024, insisting that Israel’s actions should be classified as genocide. European Commission spokeswoman Gioia Franchellucci told The Intercept that Brussels was committed to international law, and that the bloc’s relationship with Israel allows officials to express their“positions and concerns.” “The association agreement with Israel is the legal basis of our ongoing dialogue with the Israeli authorities, and it provides mechanisms to discuss issues and advance our points of view,”the spokeswoman said. West Jerusalem launched its operation in Gaza following a surprise attack by Hamas on October 7, 2023, during which militants killed around 1,200 Israelis and took around 250 hostages. Over 52,000 Palestinians have been killed since the conflict broke out, according to the enclave’s health authorities.",

    "article_text": "Pharrell Williams has a very impressive CV. He’s a singer, he’s a songwriter, he’s a producer, he’s a designer, he’s a very well-dressed dude. And, as if that wasn’t stacked enough already, he’s also one of the co-chairs of theMet Gala 2025. So when he rolled up to thered carpetat the Metropolitan Museum of Art this evening, everyone knew that a world class fit would come through. From a distance, Williams’ tailored ensemble looked like a classic monochromatic affair: whitedouble-breasted jacket, stark whitedress shirt, slim black tie, and a pair of black flaredtrousersthat were perfectly cut above his shoes. Sounds pretty normal, right? Wrong! Well, not all is what it seems. This is themen’s creative director of Louis Vuitton, after all. If you’re lucky enough to get up close and personal, you’ll find this blazer covered in loads and loads of individually stitched pearls—15,000, to be exact. This wondrous creation was crafted in-house by the Parisian maison’s finest artisans, and it took over 400 hours to create. Even the pockets and fanged-out lapels are dripped out with the stuff, and the buttons across the front and cuffs were made from orb-like glass. “I see dandyism as a set of rules and standards that reflect a certain sophistication and well-traveled taste,” he toldVoguein arecent interview. “I want it to feel like the most epic night of power, a reflection of Black resiliency in a world that continues to be colonized, by which I mean policies and legislation that are nothing short of that.” And if Pharrell Williams’shimmering sport coat is just the beginning, what an epic night it’s gonna be.

    "title": "Lewis Hamilton Nailed the Met Gala 2025 Dress Code",
    "article_text": "Some people skirt around theMet Galatheme. Others, like Lewis Hamilton, shine on through. Because on theMet Gala 2025 red carpet, his fit did its homework and passed with flying colors on a night that demands full attention to detail. As an annual fundraiser for the Costume Institute wing at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Met Gala has become a red carpet event like no other. Where awards ceremonies and film premieres often fall in line with fashion trends at large (slim-cut suits, orabstract black tie, or bigiced out broochesand so on), the Met Gala is like the most haute costume party ever created. And for guests to get it right—as in, right by fashion's armchair pundits, all of whom watch the night with the intensity of an England fan during the Euros—they have to go big, and by the dress code. That's where Lewis Hamilton won. The theme of the Met Gala 2025 is ‘Tailored For You’ to chime with the Costume Institute's upcoming exhibition,Superfine: Tailoring Black Style. It's designed to be a celebration of Black designers, of the dandy's influence on fashion, of figures that have shaped the culture. His fit, a highly decorated tailcoat in immaculate silk, was amped up with embroidery, with a brooch, with a beret, with glitzy buckled shoes from the reigning emperor of gilded footwear, Manolo Blahnik. It was pure, unadulterated dandy. Better yet, it was designed byWales Bonner. The London-based designer has long riffed on Afro-Atlantic sensibilities, creating clothes that celebrate Black culture and spaces. Her spring-summer ’21 collab with Adidas was all about the heritage of dancehalls. As Pitti Uomo’s guest designer in 2022, Bonner staged the show at the Palazzo Medici Riccardi, once the home of the so-called Black Prince of Florence who is largely thought to be the first Black head of state in Western Europe. Nobody fits the brief better than Bonner. Plus, fashion nerds love her. Oh, and we forgot to mention: Hamilton is a co-chair for this year's event, meaning he's at the top of the billing, and helping out with hosting duties—and the man set the bar very, very high.

    "title": "Met Gala 2025: Colman Domingo Dresses ‘To Make People Feel a Certain Way’",
    "article_text": "WhenColman Domingosees the outfit for the first time, he gasps. “I haven’t even put anythingonand I’m overwhelmed.” It’s a warm spring Friday, a few days ahead of the2025 Met Gala red carpet. Domingo, who is a co-host of this year’s event, has just arrived at the Valentino boutique on Madison Avenue with his longtime stylists, Wayman Bannerman and Micah McDonald, and their crew in tow. Inside a private dressing suite upstairs, every spare surface—coffee tables, couches—is covered with cloth-lined trays displaying glittering Boucheron jewels, Omega watches, and silky Valentino bowties the size of bread loaves. Here, Domingo’s custom Valentino look—an ensemble which features a modern zoot suit comprising of a checkered wool jacket and wide-legged trousers, plus a royal blue pleated cape and sequin-embroidered bolero lined with frilly ivory feathers and butterfly detailing—is still hung up on hangers, but the actor can barely contain his excitement. “Did I die? What is this?” “Every detail, oh my gosh. I love the color. It’s outstanding.” “I’m already like, way emotional.” Then Domingo giggles: “Shall we try?” The Oscar-nominated actor is dressed casually in a black Willy Chavarria tracksuit—an inadvertent nod tohis custom Chavarria ensemblefrom last year’s Met, which paid homage to two late Black style icons, actor Chadwick Boseman and fashion editorAndré Leon Talley. Both of whom have been on Domingo’s mind in the lead-up to this year’s Met, whose theme, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” centers on a vast history of Black history and menswear. A few minutes later, Domingo—holding back tears—reemerges in the suit portion of the Valentino look. “Shall we do cape?” he says with a grin, standing on a platform in front of the large three-panel dressing mirror. An Italian-speaking tailor in a white coat places the cape over the actor’s shoulders, and the room goes silent. A twinkly, cinematic instrumental tune plays over the room’s speakers. The room reaches a consensus: The cape will look great on the stairs. “Bravo, Valentino,” he tells the room, beaming. “Bravo, bravo!” While Domingo and his stylists game-plan the final fit and accessories, they laugh abouta recent tweetthat’s been making the rounds online: “Three things are certain: death, taxes, and Colman Domingo having that shit on.” To be sure, come Monday, Domingo’s carefully crafted, deeply researched ensemble will be one of the most discussed looks of the evening. But there are more surprises in store. Before long, Valentino’s creative director Alessandro Michele, whojoined the Roman houselast spring after two decades at Gucci, arrives in a quilted yellow jacket, red-and-black Buffalo plaid flannel, blue jeans, and baseball hat embroidered with the phrase “Techno is my boyfriend.” Domingo and Michele embrace, conferring quietly as the designer lovingly runs his fingers over the sequined capelet. “Bellisima,” Michele exclaims. Within the next hour, actor Harry Hamlin will swing by to say hello; he’s in the building because his daughter, the model Amelia Gray Hamlin, is also wearing one of Michele’s designs to the Met. So, too, is Domingo’s husband, Raúl Domingo, whom the actor met 20 years agovia a Missed Connections post on Craigslist; he arrives quietly, but Domingo quickly catches his eye from across the room. “Hi, husband,” Domingo says, beaming from his spot in front of the mirrors. “You want to come see what your husband is wearing?” As Domingo wraps up his fitting, the actor and I hop into a black SUV headed downtown to the Chelsea Hotel. In the lobby, we chat about the myriad inspirations behind his Met Gala look (which includes his first-ever custom grill), why he knew he would make an amazing Met host, and the cosmic destiny that he and hisEuphoriacostar Zendaya would become the reigning king and queen of the red carpet. Colman Domingo:This was before I had a conversation with anyone, I thought, “There’s a color. I should wear blue. I should wear what they call theYves Klein blue.” First of all, my mother said I always looked my best in blue. I thought, “Yeah, I want to wear blue. There’s something about blue.” And then I went for my meeting with Monica L. Miller [whose 2009 book,Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity,inspired this year’s Met Gala exhibition], and we went through the boards of what the installation would look like. And then she says, “You know what? One of the original dandies who was a freed slave, he said, ‘I can’t wait to save up to dance on my freedom day in my finest blue superfine wool.’” I literally almost stumbled. I said, “Henamed a color? That’s the color I want to wear!” I presented that color blue to my stylists and to Alessandro [Michele]. I said, “It must be blue.” And then I was going through references of history. I started to really center in on the Moors and North Africans who conquered Spain and in many ways influenced when it comes to jewelry and art and architecture. They were the first people who stunted. They came in wearing all of it. They wore the gold, they wore the emerald and the sapphires, all that. That was a part of their agency. I was having all these conversations, and then I sent all these references, and then I went to the Valentino haute couture show and it was my first haute couture show. I also thought I would love to jump across the ocean and go to another moment when Black men were really actualizing and defining themselves in fashion. And I thought of the 1940s Zoot Suit Riots, Black and brown men defiantly strutting their style. They didn’t care whether or not clothing was expensive or people were using too much. And they were being attacked for it because they were wearing too much fabric [during wartime rations]. But no, it’s expression. And I love all of it. There’s also an element of the outfit with the beautiful blue draping, which is a nod to André Leon Talley as well. Then I have another special moment, but I don’t think Valentino knows. When I smile, I want to smile with my mother’s name, Edith. I’m going to have a grill with my mother’s name. So I’m bringing my mom with me to the Met Gala. And also, it brings it to urban streetwear in the 2000s and brings it forward. First grill. Baby’s first grill. [Domingo shows me a photo of the grill on his phone.] Gold nugget at the bottom because the first ring I ever bought for myself when I worked at McDonald’s was a gold nugget. When I was 16 years old, I had a gold nugget ring, so it has a gold nugget on the bottom, “Edith” on the top. It started right after the Oscars. I was actually nervous because I was like, “Is that too late? Don’t we need to start talking about this and conceptualizing this?” But I went to the haute couture show, because I became a house ambassador for Valentino. And then, I had one meeting with Alessandro. It just gave me more of a sense of Alessandro and his vision and why he’s as romantic and maximalistic as he is. And I wanted to lean into that. I don’t know if I’m really made for every house, but Valentino, I am. Especially one that Alessandro is the creative director of. I knew that we collaborate well together. But I also knew I had to take the reins on it and just set up the inspiration based on the things that I know that Alessandro is interested in as well. Yeah. It sets him up in a beautiful way. You feel that he’s a romantic. You feel like his clothing makes you feel like you’re in a dream. That’s what I like about it too. I just like the idea of a bit more pomp and circumstance in the world. We’re always living in tricky and dangerous times, but our resistance is actually having beauty and love, and it’s got to be reflected in your clothing. I’m having my own personal party on Saturday night. I said the theme is, “Put that shit on.” And they’re like, “What does that mean?” I’m like, “You don’t know what it means? It’s such a reference.“ I’m like, “Put that shit on.” I said, “This is the time to break out those five inch heels and fur. You want to wear triple lashes? Go far. When do we get to do that?” I want to make that part of everyday life, to look like a fantasy. The real world is so harsh. A great way to access this is clothing. Oh, they said there’s a tweet that says, “Three things are going to happen for sure in your life: Death, taxes, and Colman Domingo putting that shit on.” I was like, “What? I haven’t seen that tweet. Where the fuck have I been?” Naomi Campbell told me this, and I was so taken aback by it: She says, “Colman, you’re made for fashion.” And I still was trying to figure out what that meant exactly from people who I believe are in the fashion world. I’d never considered myself to be a model. Yeah, I’ve got style, but I didn’t know that I would have such influence and impact. But at the end of the day, I know it’s because I’m an artist and I’m a storyteller, and that I know what to do with my body, and I know that I like to tell stories with that. I had no idea that I liked the fashion world so much. I love it. I’m like, would I like to be a creative director? Absolutely. Would I like to do a capsule collection? Why not? I would love to collaborate in all these ways. At 55 years old, I do feel like I’m getting another burst of creative energy with another platform that I never expected. There was a shift. Well, I can tell you there was a conscious shift. Because I knew that once I started to understand where I existed in the fashion world, I did certain things. I was actually 20 pounds heavier, and I decided to lean out even more. I’ve always been a lean person, but I just had a little bit more weight on me, like a 55-year-old man would have. And once I did that, I also had more access to clothing. So now I get everything, I have my choice of designers sending me things. I don’t need custom all the time, I can actually just wear straight off the runway. I’ll tell you this, the thing that’s been the coolest thing is, people on the street—you name it, Black, white, old, young—everybody admires fashion, and they get really excited talking about, “Oh yeah, I love the way you dress. You put that shit on.” Old Black ladies are just like, “I love the way you dress. You’re so handsome.” And again, I think it’s always been a feeling for me. I don’t just dress for myself, I dress to make people feel a certain way. I think that’s important. People, they respond to style. It brings out something good in them. Or it could trigger them, and they’re like, “Oh, I don’t know about that.” But I feel like that’s the point of it, too: conversation. Absolutely. They’re very clear about what they like. I love that it’s a convergence of so many people in popular culture, and then everyone’s having their own personal expression and everyone’s got an opinion about it. It’s like sports. It is the Super Bowl of fashion. One of the greatest things that I like right now is as an openly queer man, 55 years old, I have young boys, girls, macho dudes all admiring me. They’re like, “Oh, I love you. I want to dress like you. I wish I could. I think I could.” I’m inspiring generations of men to be like, “Yeah, I want to put that shit on too.” I feel like I have a whole league of people that I’m inspiring, and I see it, and I see the effect. I will take some credit in this interview, for sure. Listen, nobody was wearing hot pink until I wore hot pink Versace in 2021 at that Oscars. And suddenly, it became a thing. Suddenly, it was like everybody was wearing hot pink. And then, I think Valentino did a hot pink collection right after that too. They think, oh, it was a representation of queer culture. I’m like, “Not at all, actually. It was actually my references to Prince and The O’Jays and Teddy Pendergrass, dudes that I grew up with. That was the nod. I said, “You’ve got to think broader than that, than what you see.” So then people said, “Oh, okay. I get it. You’re doing something different.” You know what? If I don’t know anything about myself, I’m an incredible host. I have great parties. I know about lighting and music and guest lists. When Anna [Wintour] invited me to do that, it seemed right on the money. I was so excited. I couldn’t say yes fast enough. I said, “Whatever’s on my schedule, it’s gone.” Thank you. I don’t take any of this lightly. I’m emotional thinking about it right now because I feel like, where I come from, this is beyond anyone’s dreams. It really is. I’m living in my dreams and doing everything I want to do in every way. The idea that there would be a team of people waiting for you in a room, that was overwhelming. Walking in, it’s like a wedding day or something. That’s why I hugged the head designer and asked questions like, “How many people worked on this and how long did it take?” Because I knew that so many people were hand beading, stitching and draping for weeks, and teams of people. It’s overwhelming. I had to keep telling myself, “I’m not going to cry.” I’m a crier. I have not connected with them yet. I will connect with them on the night of, butPharrelland I, we’ve gotten to know each other here and there, because I was working with Louis Vuitton a bunch. And then, I haven’t metA$AP [Rocky], but apparently, his grandmother has a crush on me, which I’m really flattered by. I feel like that’s my jam. I’m really for women 70 and above. That’s my audience. And I think I know why: I’m possibly bringing back some romance and whatever that is. I know that my mother always wanted me to be a gentleman, and I hold doors open for women. And I think that’s what I always aspire to be. Yeah, I’m filming a film with Steven Spielberg. Very unknown director. Exactly. This is a start for him. I’m doing a film with him. It’s starring myself and Emily Blunt, Josh O’Connor, Colin Firth, and Eve Hewson. We’re having a good time shooting that. But I’m doing a lot right now. I’m shooting that right now while I have a musical that I co-wrote calledLights Out: Nat “King” Cole, that is in previews. I’ve been going to previews every night. Dulé Hill plays Nat King Cole and Daniel J. Watts playsSammy Davis Jr.It is so fantastic and I’m happy with it. That’s been going on as well. And then, I’m preparing to give a commencement speech and get an honorary doctorate, my second one, from American University next weekend, the weekend after the Met. So I’m in the middle of a lot of wonderful things right now, which is good. I filmed some of it right before I came here, in March. And then I go back to finish up my work in July. Wonderful. Me andZendaya, we just slipped right into Ali and Rue very quickly. Because we do have sort of, I wouldn’t say father/daughter, but a very big brother, little sister [relationship]. Because even off camera, we talk. We have such deep talks. Every time the camera call’s cut, we’re talking about loss, friendship, style—you name it, high and low. Sam [Levinson] is such a beautiful director. It’s really simple and easy. The content of the work can be demanding, because that’s the nature of the show. I think we’re going to really create a great season three so far. I love every beat of it. Isn’t it wild? It’s wild. We’re the king and queen of the carpet. You’re kind of right. We see each other, but weseeeach other, in a way. I'm usually chill like this, and so is Z. When I see Zendaya, she’s got a tank top on, Dickies, and some Converse. And I’m the same. Someone sees me at the gym or something and they’re like, “I love your style,” I say, “I know I’m totally disappointing you right now.” People who have gym outfits, I still don’t understand, because I can barely get it together. I’m just the most basic T-shirt, shorts. It’s where I can be really relaxed, so I have no style at the gym. Absolutely. But I think that’s also the secret weapon for me. You stunt so hard on the carpet and in the magazines that when you’re just being a regular person, no stunt. Myairport stylehas changed. I shop better for airports, because people will always want a selfie. They’re watching you travel, and you have to look a certain way. I always have a really good pair of suede loafers and a good jacket. I look a bit more dialed-up when I go to the airport. It’s no longer just sweats.",

    "title": "21 Best Sneakers for Men in 2025: Basic Low-Tops, Covetable High-Tops, and More",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Whatarethe best sneakers for men? Kind of a vague question, bud. That all depends on what you're after. Today'ssneaker landscapeis a bit like theMCU: vast, far-ranging, chock full of unexpected cameos, and prone to incite confounding levels of scrutiny from millions of adults who should probably know better. (The characters might vary, but for sneaker fans with firsthand experience working theinternecine dynamics of the aftermarket, there's no shortage of villains.) For more intel on kicks we love, check out theGQ Sneaker Shop. And much like Marvel's multibillion-dollar baby, the already-expansive sneaker galaxy is only getting bigger. Today the gamut includes everything from pony-hair printed low-tops tool' reliable canvas kicks—along with the requisite training shoes,running shoes, and basketball shoes. Figuring out where to start can be as exhausting as binging a quartet ofAvengersmovies in one bleary-eyed go. So we did it for you. Below, you'll find a mercifully succinct outline of every single sneaker style worth your time right now, all culled from the digital pages of ourextensive sneaker coverage. Because no matter what the critics (or, uh, trend forecasters) say, the best sneakers for men remain some of the best men's shoes, period. Sneakerheads, assemble! Reebok Walmart Amazon More than mere wardrobe staples,white sneakersare the base of the menswear food pyramid, the pair of shoes you’ll likely reach for more than any other in your closet. Which explains why there are a mind-boggling amount of 'em available, from all-time classics to wild-style flexes. Over the years, we've surveyed hundreds of options, testing out the cream of the crop each step of the way. (Looking for the best white sneakers you can buy with only a hundred bucks?We've got you coveredtoo.) There's a long list of classic white kicks that make solid arguments for being crownedthequintessential pair of the category and, truthfully, that crown gets passed around with the shifting trends. Right now, though, we have our eyes set on the tennis shoe legend that is the Reebok Club C 85. The lace-up shoes were originally designed for functionality on the hard clay but have transcended the racquet to become everyday casual sneakers. Most Dad shoes follow a normcore ideology that reduces them to gray running shoes, but the Reebok Club C is—dare we say—even more fatherly than the New Balance 574. It pairs with white chinos, faded 501s, or even slouchy dress pants with chameleonic ease. Vans The Vans authentic shoes are exactly what you think of when it comes to white sneakers. The lightweight canvas uppers are ideal for sunny summers and look a million times better bashed to bits. Maison Margiela SSENSE Maison Margiela's Replica sneakers take after vintage German Army Trainers but swap in upgraded materials. Their minimalist design and quality craftsmanship make them a grail sneaker for high-fashion fans and sneakerheads alike. Converse SSENSE Black sneakersmake a convincing argument for the dark side, the footwear equivalent of Emperor Palpatine whispering sweet nothings in a young Padawan's ear. (We're listening, FYI.) Black shoes are the perfect low-maintenance alternative for any serial puddle-swervers, and engaging in illegal activity isn't a prerequisite to wearing ‘em. (Most of the time.) Plus, if you’re looking for a pair of sneakers that won't look totally grimy after a few wears, the dark colorway can hide a lot. Is there any sneaker more iconic than the classic Converse Chuck Taylor? The old-school canvas sneakers have been around longer than any other on this list and was there at the forefront of the sneaker revolution, pounding the hardwood well before the Swoosh came along (yes, they were made for playing basketball). You're much less likely to spot these in an athletic context nowadays, but you're sure as hell gonna see them everywhere else. And even though Chucks come in every color under the sun, the quintessential pair is undoubtedly the black hi-top. They look aces with baggy chinos a laThe Sandlot, or even with a suit like a mod-revivalist indie band. The retro'fied Chuck 70 is definitely the version to get, thanks to a beefier silhouette, improved materials, and thicker midsole. Vans Nordstrom Vans is peak SoCal style, and while its Sk8-Hi and Old Skool models are indeed classics, the slip-on feels more laid-back and relevant than ever—especially in an era where loafers and mules are gaining most of the traction. Salomon Nordstrom Salomons are so hot, we recently devoted anentire guideto 'em. Many have questioned whether they were just coasting on archive styles, but the just-released Whisper has silenced those… whispers. HOKA REI Walking is good for you—like,reallygood for you—butwalking shoeshaven't exactly always screamed “sex appeal”…until now. Given the explosion of interest in running’s less strenuous cousin over the past year, walking shoes have, ahem, stepped up their game. They’re still packed with all the cushion-heavy outsoles, breathable uppers, and vital arch support you need for a long day on your feet, but now they’ve got the style to match. Self-described dad shoes are cool and all, but thereal dealdad shoes you'd find in an orthopedics store also look cooler than ever. For the avid, hardcore walkers, we recommend the Hoka Challenger 7 sneakers. If your idea of a good walk involves a lot more than 10,000 steps (and buckets more sweat), the Challenger 7 can make your jaunt a real workout. It's been touted by avid walkers and runners alike and swooned us into giving it a spot in ourFitness Awardsthanks to the super-grippy rubber soles, cloud-soft EVA midsoles, and lightweight feel. Mephisto Nordstrom A French comfort classic, grandpas the world over have worn their same pairs of expertly hand-made Match's for fifteen years and counting. But now, the Mephisto Match is stepping down to a new generation, and enjoying a stylemoment all of its own. New Balance New Balance The 1906R first hit shelves in 2010, but it’s never felt more relevant. Thirteen years after its debut, silver-laden, mesh-adorned kicks are everywhere, and as folks rush to scoop up the latest pair of iPod-era trainers, the 1906R—which provides true support, like all New Balance sneakers—remains a heavyweight contender for the best of them all. Brooks Running Amazon If you're considering hitting the track or the trails this year, investing in a reliable pair ofrunning shoesis a must. The right pair should offer cushioning, durability, and energy return in spades—in other words, the opportunity to feel like Eliud Kipchoge, whether you're an amateur enthusiast looking for a new daily trainer or a hardcore half-marathoner in the market for a racer that'll help you smash your last PB. From trail-ready runners to everyday beaters you can wear to jog around the neighborhood, there's no better shoes to start your journey to Olympic (or near-Olympic) glory. Everyone's feet are different (variety!) which is why we're somewhat hesitant to bestow a best running shoe superlative to a single pair of kicks. But we will, with the caveat that you should probably consult a pro who can identify the best running shoe for your particular needs. That said, the Brooks Ghost 15 nabbed our award for the best nice, normal running shoe and a great pick for most people, especially those who aren't seasoned runners. It comes in a variety of widths and features a thick and bouncy midsole that makes for a smooth, comfortable stride. Asics Nordstrom Given all the hype surrounding Asics's retro models, it’s easy to forget that the brand makes some of thebest pure performance runners, too, and the Gel-Nimbus 27—with soft, engineered Jacquard mesh that seamlessly wraps around your foot—is a great example of that. Saucony Saucony Saucony designed the Endorphin Speed for racing, but this shoe is for a lot more than that. With high-end foam, a rockered sole shape, and a winged nylon plate inside for stability and spring, the Endorphin Speed 4 is part of an emerging hybrid class of shoes, with elements of top-tier race shoes but also enough comfort for daily use. Nike Nike Mr Porter Homing in onthe best Nike shoesis worth the grunt work. Since setting up shop in the mid-'60s, the Portland-based juggernaut has churned out one hit sneaker after another, expanding into lifestyle footwear while upholding its commitment to athletic excellence each step of the way. Today, the Swoosh sells just about everything tangentially related to the sporting life, but its sneakers remain the crown jewel of the business. The best Nike shoes prove why the brand is still miles—and many, many dollars—ahead of the competition. Nike's long been the brand for hype sneakers and hardcore athletic shoes. But when it comes to dad shoes, the Swoosh wasn't quite cracking it—until 2018 when theVomerogot a redux in cahoots with the modern label A-Cold-Wall*. The shoe's origins date back to 2011 as a running shoe, but Nike's methodically released new colorways since the ACW link-up. The result? The It Sneaker of the moment. Nike Nike's Air Force 1 shoe is the epitome of sneaker culture—it's the shoe that you work to keep looking bleach-white and uncreased lest you get roasted by the real heads. It's a certified classic and the stark white colorway and chunky silhouette are perfect for this wide-leg pant era. Nike Nike During the #menswear-era boom, the Killshot 2 became a go-to for folks looking for kicks they could style with everything from pocket tees andkhakisto lived-inOxford shirtsand raw jeans. And while that era of menswear may be over, all the reasons it became so beloved are still totally valid. Adidas Amazon Zappos If you're Team Stripes through and through, there'splenty of options to choose from. Adidas remains a reliable source for classic sneakers (think Sambas, Superstars, and Stan Smiths), the type of perennial best-sellers that still inspire countless imitations today. More recently, the German sportswear giant has stepped on the gas, rolling out smash-hit collaborations with designer powerhouses like Prada, cult-loved labels likeWales Bonner, and globally-adored megastars like Bad Bunny. All of which means there's no better time to take stock of the company's roster of men's sneakers. And if we're talking about the best Adidas shoe right now, there's no question that it has to be the Samba. The ascendence of soccer-inflected style, countless hot colorways and a heap of juiced-up collabs have placed the Adidas Samba front and center of the sneaker conversation, but the classic white colorway will be a forever classic even when the trends turn toward other sneakers (someday). The Samba is so dominant that it could have easily taken the crowns for the best white sneaker and even best sneaker of the year, but we'll be good and save those hot takes for later. Adidas Adidas A less well-known silhouette, but one that's no doubt rising in the great Collective Clout Consciousness, is the SL 72. The SL stands for “super light”—a.k.a. how you'll feel after all the compliments they earn. Adidas Mr Porter If the classic Samba is our pick of the bunch, consider this brown, breathable pair the summer house equivalent. The Weekend Samba, if you will. New Balance SSENSE Over the years,New Balancehas evolved from a geriatric standard to apurveyor of genuine cool-guy staples, cooking up new models (and roping in a who’s who ofnotablecollaborators) for sneaker enthusiasts of every stripe to lust over. At first the brand’s popularity seemed rooted in irony, a nod to normcore stylings, but wear anything long enough and the appreciation starts to become sincere. And with Aimé Leon Dore honcho Teddy Santisin charge of the company's premium Made in USA sub-line, the Boston-based brand continues to keep its pedal to the cushy, orthotic metal. New Balance's flagship 990 series is what shouldered the brand to the upper echelons of sneakerdom, but these days the the trendy 2002R feels like it's taken the 990's seat. It originally debuted in 2010 and after a recent reboot is only now getting its flowers. It's got a similar DNA to the 990v3 but with more complex mesh, leather, and suede panelling that should make it a better playground for color combinations and collaborations. New Balance Mr. Porter First released in 2001, at the time the 991 set the standard for modern runners. Today, the shoe is another collaboration favourite, having been updated with a full-length FuelCell midsole, and the brand's ABZORB SBS pods in the heels for all-day cushioning. This was a runner’s shoe, after all. New Balance SSENSE How do you make a prototypical dad shoe feel even dadlier? If you're New Balance, you introduce the 530, which ditched the brand's legendary gray suede uppers in favor of pristine white mesh—lending this early-'90s classic a sporty-but-ready-to-mow-the-lawn energy.",

    "title": "The Rucker 4.0 Is My Favorite Piece of Warm-Weather Fitness Gear",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Though mobs of sweaty straphangers and a perpetual dusting of pollen may make spring seem like a drag, it's the perfect time to go outside and get some exercise in. It's nottoohot (yet) and you can still ride that wave of motivation you garnered while you were cooped up all winter. My advice for embarking on a new fitness journey? Try rucking. At its simplest, rucking is walking for distance while carrying some kind of weight. “Over the past few years, rucking has gone beyond its military roots to become a fixture in CrossFit boxes and hiking trails across the country,” Ashwin Rodrigues wrote forGQwhen we dubbed ittheworkout of 2024. “[It's] a welcome counter to these high-tech fitness protocols.” The best part? Rucking is much more low-impact than running—all while providing significantly more cardiovascular and muscular engagement than walking alone, depending how much weight you use. Plus, having weight in a properbackpack—like one fromGoRuck—pulls your shoulders up and back,aligning your spineand improving your posture. Over the last few weeks, I've been testing its flagshipRucker 4.0with a30-pound weight plate. Billed as a “gym on your back,” it sets the standard for what a rucking backpack ought to be. Here are my thoughts on the Rucker 4.0—and whether it is worth the $255 price tag. GORUCK Shop at GORUCK Amazon Capacity: 20L Dimensions: 11.5\"W x 18\"H x 5.5\"D Materials: 1000D Cordura Nylon Sizes: 3 sizes (15L, 20L, 25L) Colorways: Various GoRuck was founded by a former U.S. Army Green Beret, and that military lineage is immediately apparent in its gear. All of itsbagsare open flat, a design detail borrowed from special forces medical kits. The Rucker 4.0 has “MOLLE” webbing (modular, lightweight load-carrying equipment) made up of “PALS” (pouch attachment ladder system—the military loves its acronyms) along the exterior. There's also a small Velcro section on the front of the bag for attaching a patch. There are a bunch of different colorways and sizes, and there's a handy size guide on the site if you're not sure which one to snag. That's important, since when you're rucking, it's crucial that the bag rests securely on your back and just above the hips—carrying too high or low could risk injury and discomfort. (For reference, I am 6'1\" and opted for the 20L model in the blackout colorway, which fit me perfectly.) Along the back of the bag are two padded Velcro compartments designed to hold the brand's ruck plates, which are weights designed specifically to fit within the backpack system. The ruck plates and compartments keep the weight balanced high on your back, contributing to an overall more enjoyable experience than say, tossing adumbbellin aJansport. I opted for a single 30-pound ruck plate, but you could easily load the Rucker 4.0 to carry an ambitious 75 pounds. (If you're not sure how much weight to get, my advice is to start light and gradually increase over time.) The difference between using the Rucker 4.0 and regular backpacks is striking, and goes a long way towards justifying the moderately hefty price tag. A few months ago, when I first started reading about rucking, I threw a 30-pound kettlebell in an oldPatagonia day packI had lying around and went out for a few miles. Unfortunately, the straps were thin, the bag felt unbalanced, and the weight felt borderline unmanageable. (No shade to Patagonia; it makes exceptional gear, the day pack is just not designed specifically for rucking.) By comparison, the Rucker 4.0's straps are extremely padded, the bag is sturdy, and the same weight feels noticeably lighter on my back, which makes it a more comfortable experience and enables me to get more out of the workout by going further and faster. The Rucker 4.0 also uses heavy duty YKK zippers and is classified as “highly water resistant,” so outside of a torrential downpour or being submerged under water, your gear will likely stay dry. My favorite feature? There's a Velcro opening at the top of the bag between the shoulder straps that allows you to feed a water bladder hose through it, which makes staying hydrated on longer rucks a snap. I also opted to pair my Rucker 4.0 with the optional padded hip belt ($35), which attaches via the MOLLE webbing on the sides of the bag and helps stabilize and evenly distribute the bag's weight. It would definitely be useful if you're aiming to ruck longer distances with heavier loads or if you're looking to keep the bag centered on your body while doing calisthenics. The Rucker 4.0 retails for $255, with the 30-pound ruck plate and hip belt adding another $155. So for just over $400, all in, you're probably asking yourself (understandably):Is it worth it?In my opinion, yes. If you want to get into rucking, the Rucker 4.0 is by far the gold standard when it comes to gear. It has a lifetime guarantee and provides a noticeable improvement in comfort and load management when compared to regular backpacks. It also doubles as a great water-resistant daypack to bring gear with you on the trail, whether it's a first aid kit, some GORP, or even a celebratory post-ruck beer—because after a long ruck, you'll have earned one.",

    "title": "Adidas Sambas Might Cost More Soon Thanks to Tariffs",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. If you were thinking about buying a fresh pair of Adidas Sambas, hustle up. News recently broke that tariffs, those AP-history callbacks come to haunt us all, will almost certainly lead to a higher price on the footwear staple that you, me, half the tweens in my Brooklyn neighborhood,Benson Boone,politicians, andPaul Mescalwear almost daily. Last week, Adidas chief executive Bjørn Gulden warned the world that price hikes across the brand’s line-up were almost inevitable. “Since we currently cannot produce almost any of our products in the U.S., these higher tariffs will eventually cause higher costs for all our products for the U.S. market,” he explained on an earnings call,per theNew York Times. Then he said what everyone was thinking: “Cost increases due to higher tariffs will eventually cause price increases.” How soon those price increases could arrive across the Adidas lineup are anyone’s guess; the German company says it stockpiled clothing and footwear in the States before the tariffs went into effect, and did not respond to a request for comment fromGQon the timing or scale of any potential price increases. To be clear, Adidas would likely institute price hikes across almost its entire product line in the States, notonlySambas. But if you’ve laced up a pair of Adidas Sambas, you know all the reasons why they’re beloved—and why a price hike would be a buzzkill. Adidas Adidas Adidas Adidas The 78-year-old design has held the “sneaker of the summer” title for almost half a decade, achieving default-shoe status for millions of people worldwide. For good reason: the Samba is lightweight, comfortable as hell, and visually clean, earning it an A+ for “plays well with fits of all types.” I’ve had a pair of Sambas for 18 months, and can personally attest to their range. They let me put 12,000 steps on the board while walking around Old San Juan last monthandlet me rip through a kettlebell workout with ease just this morning. Get you a sneaker who can, etc. Critical to the Adidas Sambas' siren call is their price. At $100 retail for the men's Samba OG, keeping a pair in the rotation is an easy choice. Maybe a $10 price hike doesn’t radically change the math on that decision. But $20? $25? More? Do we get the next batch of cool-as-hellGrace Wales Bonner variations, which often cost upwards of $200 pre-tariffs, if that price goes skyward? It’s possible that the easy choice becomes a lot more difficult. Like, say, AP-History-test difficult. So while Adidas hasn’t explicitly said that price hikes are imminently coming forthereigning everyperson sneaker, or anything elsewearing three stripes, the writing seems to be on the wall. Or, better yet, the writing seems to be on the price tag.",

    "title": "6 Best Mattresses for Sex to Make the Bed Rock in 2025",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Want to give yoursexlife a boost? Start with yourmattress. Just as every great painting starts as a blank canvas, the best mattresses for sex make the ideal jumping-off point for some seriously good lovemaking. After all, unless you’re an Olympic-level sex athlete, you’re probably doing thedeedin bed most of the time. But what actually makes a mattress good for boning on? We spoke to some experts to get the rundown. Saatva Saatva Type: HybridFirmness: MediumSizes Available: Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, Split King, Cal KingHeight: 11.5\" All three experts I interviewed for this piece raved about Saatva mattresses, and specifically this hybrid one. It combines individually wrapped coils with memory foam, which has been infused with cooling gel, so even if you tend to sleep hot, this mattress should keep you comfy. Natassia Miller, a certified sexologist and the founder ofWonderlust, recommends this one for its great bounce and excellent edge support. \"It’s like the mattress version of a good lover: responsive, supportive, and doesn’t overheat under pressure,\" she says. Brooklyn Bedding Brooklyn Bedding Type: HybridFirmness: Medium (also available in soft and firm)SizesAvailable: Twin, Twin XL, Full, Short Full, Queen, Short Queen, Olympic Queen, King, Short King, Split King, Cal King, Split Cal King, RV KingHeight: 12.25\" Miller recommends this hybrid mattress for shoppers on a budget. \"It’s bouncy, cool, and durable,\" she says, making it \"a solid all-rounder if you want performance without a luxury price tag.\" Individually encased coils give it great bounceback and motion isolation, while multiple layered types of foam add comfort and cushioning. One bummer is that you'll have to shell out an extra $300 for acooling top, so this may not be quite as good a deal for hot sleepers. WinkBeds WinkBeds Type: HybridFirmness: Medium-firm (also available in an even firmer option, plus a softer one and one designed for plus-size people)SizesAvailable: Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, Cal KingHeight: 13.5\" This luxe hybrid mattress comes highly recommended by Leah Levi, a therapist and relationship expert forFlure. \"It combines the best parts of coil and foam systems to stay responsive, quiet, and supportive across the entire surface,\" she explains. While its price isn't exorbitant for a mattress, it boasts fancy features you'd normally have to pay more for, including targeted lumbar support, fantastic edge support, and stabilizing gel foam for motion isolation. Helix Helix Type: HybridFirmness: MediumSizesAvailable: Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, Short Queen, King, Cal King, RV KingHeight: 13.5\" Miller likes that this popular mattress is “plush enough to be cozy, but still springy enough for movement.” In other words: It's perfect for sex. But perhaps even more notable is its noise level; Miller says this is a particularly quiet mattress, so you won't have to worry about roommates or family overhearing your sexploits through thin walls. Sleep-wise, this mattress is best suited for side sleepers, with its layers of plush memory foam, but its coils provide targeted back support that anyone can appreciate. Saatva Saatva Type: LatexFirmness: One side is softer, one side is firmerSizesAvailable: Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, Split King, Cal King, Upper-Flex KingHeight: 10\" \"Saatva is a popular mattress brand that offers multiple firmness levels to choose from,\" says Dr. Jenn Gunsaullus, Ph.D., a sociologist and resident sex educator forPjur. Dual-sided mattresses are spendy, but they offer some versatility that other mattresses don't: \"They can be flipped, if you prefer a softer sleeping surface when you’re not being intimate,\" Gunsaullus explains. Not everyone will love having to flip their bed back and forth between sleep mode and sex mode on the regular, but it might be worthwhile for shoppers whose sex-mattress preferences differ dramatically from their sleep-mattress preferences. Avocado Avocado Type: LatexFirmness: Firm (medium and soft versions are also available but cost more)SizesAvailable: Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, Cal KingHeight: 11\" Shoppers who are environmentally conscious might prefer a mattress made of organic materials, like this one. It lacks a lot of the chemical add-ons that other mattresses have, too (such as cooling gel or flame retardant), and its latex foam material offers better airflow and bounceback than memory foam. \"It’s one of the most sustainable mattresses on the market,\" Miller says— plus, it's \"great for sex and your conscience.\" One thing to note here, though: the softer versions of this mattress cost hundreds of dollars more than the firm version, so if you prefer a plusher sleeping experience, there are more cost-effective options out there. “A good sex-friendly mattress should strike the right balance between comfort and performance,” Miller says. “Think of it as your silent (but very supportive) partner.” Here are some key qualities to consider when shopping for your next mattress. You could fall down the mattress-research rabbit hole for hours if you wanted to (and I have!), so to spare you the trouble (and the back pain), here’s some key info to keep in mind when mattress-shopping: Dr. Jenn Gunsaullus, Ph.D., sociologist and resident sex educator forPjur Leah Levi, therapist and relationship expert forFlure Natassia Miller, certified sexologist and founder ofWonderlust",

    "title": "Is Donald Trump Cool, Actually?",
    "article_text": "Fran Lebowitz once called Donald Trump “a poor person’s idea of a rich person,” saying, “all that stuff he shows you in his house—the gold faucets—if you won the lottery, that’s what you’d buy.” The quote, taken from a2016Vanity Fairarticle, has since been gilded and embellished to becomesomething like“Donald Trump is a stupid man’s idea of a smart person, a poor man’s idea of a rich man, and a weak man’s idea of a strong man.” The embellished version has become the more-quoted quote, because there’s an obvious emotional truth to it. (“When the legend becomes fact,” as another famous misquotation has it, “print the legend.”) That Trump is an avatar for a child’s idea of a lot of things, especially masculinity, is key to understanding the entire current political moment. This idea was expressed perhaps most credulously, if unintentionally, by comedian Andrew Schulz a couple weeks back. \"When I was younger, like, Democrats werecool. They were getting their dick sucked in the office. They were supportive of hip-hop music. They said, 'Do whatever you want, we don't want to be in your bedroom—they were cool with gay people,\" Schulz told the hosts of the Trigger Nometry podcast, in a clipwidely sharedon rightwing media. “It was cool to be a Democrat! Now, the president got three baby mamas. He's getting pussy left and right. He's cool.He'sthe one saying, 'Say whatever the fuck you want.' So now conservatives have become Democrats. So, I don't think I've changed. I just like the dudes that get pussy and say whatever they want.\" (When the Daily Caller’s “news clipper” transcribed the video for Twitter, he pointedly omitted “they were cool with gay people,” which I suppose is neither here nor there.) “Young Black men will identify with Trump because he has legal trouble and baby mama drama” is a take the conservative media has been tryingastroturffor years; now they’ve finally gotten someone to say it in earnest, and it’s a 41-year-old white guy from Manhattan who grew upvacationing on Fire Island. Ah, well. They’ll take what they can get, I suppose. Still, it is jarring to hear a grown adult share this corny of a takeout loud, let alone be congratulated for it. Comedians often have to play a little dumb in service of a bit, but talking about 78-year-old Donald Trump “getting pussy” feels like a bridge too far. The Stormy Daniels encounter, the last independently verified account of Donald Trump having sex, took place in 2006. And hip-hop? Donald Trump famously loves “YMCA” and got goosebumps fromhearing the theme song toCats. Axios published hisplaylistlast year and it didn’t have a single rap song on it. Nonetheless, the Schulz takedidhave a sense of historical rhyme. “I haven’t changed, the Democrats have changed,” is a conservative canard even older than 40-something white guys like Andrew Schulz and I. And like most things Trump, it carries with ita distant echo of Ronald Reagan. “We were proud to be New Deal Democrats,” Dennis Quaid says as Ronald Reagan in theReaganbiopic, during a press conference scene. “So why did you leave them?” asks a reporter. “I didn’t—they left me,” movie Reagan says, to laughter and applause. One of the key differences between Schulz and Reagan here is that Reagan was a Democrat until he was 51. Schulz references the Bill Clinton/Monica Lewinsky scandal, which would’ve broken when he was about 14. Has your idea of what makes a “cool guy” really not changed since your early teens? Is that something to brag about? Should Fred Durst be the president? But the purpose here isn’t really to bash Andrew Schulz for rewording rightwing talking points into something vaguely resembling comedian banter. (I’m reminded here of an early aughts Carlos Mencia bit where he admiringly compared George W. Bush to Clint Eastwood at the end ofUnforgiven.) We know well that MAGA’s most popular figures tend to resemble these childish notions of cool manliness. When Andrew Tateshared a video of himselfdoing dumbbell presses shirtless on his leather couch while typing on his laptop and smoking a hookah in front of his collection of expensive watches, all I could think was that it would appeal the the same seventh graders who once spoke in awed tones about dubious hand jobs and unrealistic foreplay involving candy. This is a man living out the wildest fever dreams of a suburban virgin. As the fashion critic Derek Guy described it inBloomberg, “This is masculinity built for the [social media] scroll. Being an alpha male today is partly about adopting an aesthetic shaped by culture wars and online provocateurs... the look will change. The slogans will too. But the performance will remain: a man offering a caricature as comfort, selling certainty to those unsettled by change.” If we can understand why these kid’s drawings come to life are peddling a caricature, and to whom, the question then becomes: What do they do once in power? One answer seems to come in the form of Pete Hegseth, who appears to be attempting the meatspace equivalent of posting through it after asecond leaked Signal chatof him sharing sensitive war plans, this time to a group that included his wife, his brother, and his lawyer. What’s better, ordering extra-judicial bombing raids or bragging about it to your friends? As his tenure as Secretary of Defense (it still feels insane to type that) reportedly circles the drain, Hegseth compensated with more tough talk. “Hoaxers!” hefumed at the mediaassembled in front of an Easter Egg Roll on the White House lawn, as his children looked on uneasily behind him. “This group right here, full of hoaxers that peddle anonymous sources from leakers with axes to grind, and thenyouput it all together as if it's some news story.” Hegseth was animated, punctuating his statements with broad hand gestures and act-outs so elaborate they would shame John Oliver. Mostly people focused on his wildly uneven sideburns, which seemed not entirely out of place on a man whose alleged alcohol abuse was once the subject ofaWall Street Journalstory. Was this Hegseth’s Rudy-Giuliani-melting-on-camera moment? Two days later onFox & Friends, Hegseth pulled basically the same act, presumably to a much friendlier audience and without his kids being there to embarrass. Stillhe seemed manic, almost to the point of being frantic. “That's not why I am here,” Hegseth harangued, after doing an energetic pantomime of making a cocktail. “I am here because president Trump asked me to bring warfighting back to the Pentagon. Every single day. That is our focus.\" Hegseth’s big gestures and theater kid-bully energy made it easy to remember that he was, essentially, an influencer—a former Fox News talking head who wasreportedlyforced out, for financial mismanagement, of the small non-profit he’d been running. His nomination having already withstooda lengthy expose claiminga history of drunkenness, professional incompetence, and hush money payments over sexual misconduct, Hegseth now faces a revolt by colleagues and former friends.One of the “hit pieces”he railed against was written by John Ullyot, a guy who had written anearlierop-edarguing that Hegseth was “the best choice to reform the Pentagon” just four months ago. Ullyot has since reversed course, after Hegseth’s two Signal scandals and the firing of three of Hegseth’s closest advisors. Ken Klippensteindescribed an environmentwhere Hegseth has lost the respect of the rank and file.Ryan Grim wrote of“a roiling internal meltdown among top Pentagon staff.” Even in herdefenseof Hegseth, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said “the entire Pentagon is working against” him. Interestingly enough, the first high-profile guy to get rebuked, seemingly, over “Signal-gate” ended up beingNational Security Adviser Mike Waltz, who had allegedly organized the group chat about Yemeni war plans that mistakenly includedAtlanticjournalist Jeffrey Goldberg. Waltz, who actually looks like an older, more waterlogged Hegseth, wasn’t officially fired, just reassigned, as ambassador to the United Nations (an organization Trumpists have long held in contempt). Again, the move is only really possible to understand within the context of cartoon manliness. There’s nothing less manly to the MAGAsphere than caving to public opinion. They like the guys who “say whatever they want,” not the ones who would kowtow to the chattering masses. To actually fire Hegseth or Waltz would be to behave unmasculinely. It seems that even those previously sold on Hegseth and the MAGA agenda in general are discovering that child-like notions of what a “warrior” should be and appointees designed for maximum optics appeal might not actually be that great atleading. Hegseth’s increasingly erratic performance lays bare the hysterical overcompensation at the root of it all. Even putting aside actual administration, theperformanceis slipping. Hegseth keeps hammering “warfighting” as his focus, a weird, techy-sounding neologism that conjures not so much Rambo as a startup boss in a quarter zip. Should we onboard more soldiers to fight wokeness? Calendarize a battle plan against pronouns? Or should we table that for later? The Trump administration locked into a course where they can’t admit fault without tacitly feminizing themselves, but the contradictions are still obvious. After Mike Waltz was reassigned to the UN, he was replaced in his former position by Marco Rubio. It almost goes without saying that Rubio, who is also the Secretary of State, is pretty much no one’s idea of either a manly man or a “war fighter.” Trump’s own nickname for the man was “Little Marco.” (The chief appeal of an asshole like Trump is that he will occasionally be an asshole to people you don’t like.) Much of the second Trump era has involved replacing career bureaucrats and politicians like Rubio with showmen like Pete Hegseth and Dan Bongino, men whose main (possibly only) selling points were being louder and more obvious in their presentations of masculinity. But now even Trump loyalists are beginning to realize that you can actuallydoa lot more evil stuff when you don’t spend so much time gossiping about it. As Tony Soprano once complained to his therapist, “What ever happened to Gary Cooper? The strong, silent type?Thatwas an American!” People like Hegseth certainly aren’t silent, and there seems to be a belated realization that maybe they were never that strong, either. Some of our caricatures have a way of collapsing when they collide with reality.",

    "title": "‘The Rehearsal’ Is the TV Event of the Decade",
    "article_text": "This is an edition of the weekly newsletter Tap In, GQ senior associate editor Frazier Tharpe’s final word on the most heated online discourse about music, movies, and TV.Sign up here to get it free. There is a special, unique, and increasingly rare thrill in watching a television series where week-to-week, you have absolutely no idea what you’re in for—a show that dares to defy the formula and familiarity built into TV’s DNA. Back in 2022,Nathan Fielderachieved this feat in the first season of hisHBOseriesThe Rehearsal, in which Fielder confronted his longstanding fascinations with the inherent artifice behind human interactions and behaviour, breaking through the fourth wall only to invite the audience to watch him reconstruct it—and then dared us to see how thoroughly we could pinpoint, in the aftermath, what was real and what was theater. Only the Real Fielder Heads (those of us with taste) could truly find it funny but everyone who watched found it compelling—all the way up to a finale that pulled the rug out, tying together grander themes of identity and soul-searching that had been in play the whole time underneath the surface of Fielder’s play-acting schemes. That first season was so effective, and felt so complete, that it left many viewers—or at least this viewer—wondering where a second season could possibly go. An early-April trailer drop that hinted at a season focused on air-traffic control and flight safety, only left us all more confused—and also bewildered, since the already eerily emotionally-attuned comedian’s years-in-the-making project appeared to be addressinga hyper-current news phenomenon. Now that we’re about halfway throughThe Rehearsal’s sophomore season, it’s clear that Fielder hasn’t just lived up to the first season—he’s found a higher gear and is doing career-best work.The Rehearsalmay go down as the TV event of the year, maybe of the decade. Although I have press screeners for the whole season, I’m writing this having only watched up through last night’s episode—but when you’ve just seen Nathan Fielder spend weeks cosplaying as Captain Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger only to emerge with a real, credibly psychoanalyzed thesis about how the legendary pilot actually saved the day on the fateful flight that made him a household name, I’m ready to say I’ve seen enough to call it. I don’t know what I’m watching, but I know it’s genius. The funniest thing about all of this is that if you squint hard enough, all of the scenarios onThe Rehearsalso far this season—the Twitter-timeline catnip, I-can’t-believe-he-went-there rabbit holes he’s gone down—are also some of Fielder’s most contrived work. If the show’s mission is really to figure out how and why improved communication between airline pilots can lead to less downed flights, there was no actual good reason to rope an eager first officer’s blatantly wayward relationship into the mix as “research.” The connection that Fielder draws in episode two from pilot social interaction to his own real beef with Paramount over an old episode ofNathan For Youis tenuous at best. And I couldn’t really tell you why this week’s installment finds him fixated on Sully. But it hardly matters when the material generated by these leaps of logic is so jaw-dropping. Watching Fielder drag a pilot’s relationship problems into the limelight of national television, confront and interrogate and contradict his own beef with a streaming network on a series produced by their rival, and dig deeper into the psyche of a hero pilot thanTom HanksandClint Eastwoodcould—all of this is uncharted, unpredictable territory for TV. And so far, it’s all landing much more smoothly than the errant flights that led Fielder on this mission to begin with. It’s one thing to watch him recreate facsimiles of banal society, bending back and forth on what’s real and what’s a “rehearsal,” all while doing theJoker-slidedown a pile of HBO’s money. But if antics like pretending to be Baby Sully and choking on fake breast milk out of a sick commitment to the bit was all this show had going for it, it would be funny, but ultimately come up empty. Sticking with the bit even further, combing through Sully’s biography, and reaching a very compelling hypothesis that Evanescence was the lynchpin of him saving so many lives on that 2009 flight—these are the unforeseen left turns that makeThe Rehearsalthe most exciting show out. In the midst of premium-grade clowning, Fielder is producing pure uncut cringe, yes, but also, weirdly, catharsis. To think that these are all just the building blocks to a grand revelation that we can’t see coming yet feels both threatening and exhilarating.The Rehearsalis the rare new frontier exploration funded by a blank check and validating every dollar so far. Quite simply, it’s the best thing on TV.

    "title": "12 Best Pubic Hair Trimmers for Nick-Free Results in 2025",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. The best pubic hairtrimmersare deeply individual devices. Your idealtrimmerdepends on the result you want—be it a tidying up, full shave, orlight snipping. Luckily, there are a ton of great options on the market today to take care of whatever hair situation you're working with. After you've settled on the righttrimmerfor you, the other thing you'll want need istime. “The expression ‘slow is smooth, and smooth is fast’ is very apropos to shaving the pubic area,” saysRyan Turner, MD, a board-certified NYC dermatologist and co-founder ofTRNR Skin. “While trimming or shaving the scrotum [in particular] isn’t rocket science, Iwouldn’t recommend doing itwhen you’re in a rush. Proper prep, andtaking your time, will yield the best results.” Read on to see our top picks—along with everything else you need to know abouttrimmingyour hedges. Happy Nuts Amazon Happy Nuts Trimming options:2 trimming guards (1-5mm + 7-11mm), 0.5mm bare-guard trim| Battery:90-minute runtime on a 2-hour charge| Waterproof:Yes Why we love it:While Happy Nuts already had a dedicated ball trimmer (called “The Ballber,\" it’s worth noting), their newer body hair trimmer is my go-to for dedicated nether-area aesthetics. I’m inclined to tell you that you don’tneeda dedicated trimmer for your balls, hence it’s a good consolidation to have one that tackles your testicles as well as the rest of your body hair. I always say to lean into the tool you require more readily: If you first need a trimmer for back hair and body hair, then get one that also manages pubes just fine. However, if you care a lot about having a dedicated mons-pubis manager—and one that tackles body hair with equal aplomb—then The Lumberjack here will keep you tidy. In terms of function, this one cuts close enough for a smooth result across your mons, but that first attachable and length-adjustable guard provides just enough buffer for your ballsack so that you don’t get nicked along the way. Add to that, its waterproofness, long battery life, and no-slip grip, and you have a terrific device that takes all the stress out of groin upkeep. MANSCAPED Amazon Trimming options:2 adjustable guards, one ranging from 3mm to 6mm, the other from 10 mm to 13 mm |Battery:Rechargeable; 90-minute runtime; 3-hour charge |Waterproof:Yes Why we love it:This electric trimmer comes highly recommended by sexologist and sex educatorLilithfoxx, who loves that it's \"designed with men’s grooming in mind, but still versatile enough for all genders.\" Its blades are made of rust-proof ceramic instead of metal, which cuts down on irritation (and means you likely won't need to replace the blades as frequently!), making this a solid pick if you've got sensitive skin. It also boasts some nifty quality-of-life features like a wireless charging dock, a travel-lock function so it won't spring to life in your suitcase, and a built-in LED spotlight so you can see what you're doing, even in low light conditions. Panasonic Amazon Trimming options: A trimmer head, a shaver head, a bikini comb attachment for thicker hair, and a 1mm skin guard attachment |Battery:1 AA battery (not included) |Waterproof:Yes Why we love it:\"For those who want a smaller, more portable option, the Panasonic Bikini Shaper and Trimmer is fantastic,\" Lilithfoxx says. It's great for getting into nooks and crannies, and its petite profile makes it a handy travel companion. Whether you're shaving thick hair or just cleaning up some strays, the four attachments in this kit should have you covered, even if you've got sensitive skin—its hypoallergenic blades and rounded edges help it minimize irritation. Philips Norelco Amazon Walmart Philips Trimming options:Skin-protection shave cap, plus 3mm comb guard| Battery:30-minute runtime on 8-hour charge| Waterproof:Yes Why we love it:If what you want is a skin-close shave without the worry of a sharp cartridge razor, then stick with this electric shaver. \"There’s a reason for OneBlade being one of the most popular trimmers in the world right now,\" says sexologistSofie Roos: \"It does it all.\" Like all other OneBlades, this one transforms into a trimmer with a single attachment, should you simply want to manage a light overgrown lawn. This particular model also offers ample guardrails between each tooth to prevent nicking and tugging. Maybe most impressive of all is how quiet it runs. \"It's perfect if you need to sneak into the bathroom for some last-minute pubic trimming when your partner is in the house,\" says Roos. Balls Amazon Trimming options:Adjustable guard trims at three intervals (3mm, 4.5mm, 6mm), bare guard 0.5mm| Battery:1-hour runtime on 40-minute charge| Waterproof:Yes Why we love it:If you want one dedicated ball trimmer, make it Balls’ trimmer, which includes a silicone bracelet to prevent dropping it, an ergonomic design, and no-slip handle, and an adjustable guard attachment with various trimming intervals. On top of all that, it has tightly spaced teeth, which help you avoid nicking and cutting, and a generous runtime that gives our top prize winner a run for its jewels. Use it for your balls, certainly, but for the rest of your groin, too. (Heads up: At the time of publication, the only color in stock is pink, but the function is 100% the same.) Braun Amazon Trimming options:Easy attachment-free dial with 20 trimmer settings; 13 accessories including a mini foil shaver, body trimmer, T-blade, and adjustable beard comb| Battery:3 hours run on 2.5-hour charge| Waterproof:Yes Why we love it:Should you want an all-in-one grooming device (beard trimmer included), then make it Braun’s. Swap between the body groomer and face groomer attachments to manage coarser hair with thoughtfully-close-together teeth. No nicks, no cuts, and the device allows for adjustable trimming so that you can let your pubes be as bushy (or trimmed) as you please. Plus, the fact that you get a separate head for this one makes it easy to be church-and-state with your beard vs. body hair upkeep—though I still suggest a good hot water and soap rinse after each use down south. Panasonic Amazon Panasonic Trimming options:Angled vertical trimming head, swappable guard lengths: 3mm, 6mm, and a sensitive-skin “helmet” guard| Battery:Rechargeable; 50-minute runtime; 1-hour chargeWaterproof:Yes Why we love it:The best back hair shaver and manscaper in the game, Panasonic’s Body Groomer offers a vast range of custom trimming lengths, and the unique ability to trim inside any odd crevice, at any odd angle (thanks to its vertically arranged teeth). It’s great for spot-checking tall pubes or just generally grazing over the upper centimeter of overgrown hedges. It’s not my first pick for groin upkeep of all the devices on this list,butit is my first pick for chest and back hair maintenance (especially self-administered back hair trimming). So if that’s what you need foremost, then this one is a great investment that will serve you quite well below the belt, too. Wahl Amazon Trimming options:Bare trimmer plus four guards (1/8, 1/4, 3/8, 1/2\")| Battery:2 AA rechargeable batteries (included with charger)| Waterproof:No Why we love it:If your pubes are like a woody thicket, or vastly overgrown, then it’s a good time to introduce the peanut. This tool is foremost a hair clipper, but its small size and serious muscle (plus its portability) make it an easy add-on for your dopp kit, a great weekend warrior for travel, or just a terrific tackler of the shrubby mons pubis. (I would avoid using it on the balls, at least flush on the skin; it’s blades are not spaced taut enough for that.) Marlowe Amazon Gillette Amazon Gillette Amazon Meridian Amazon If you’re in the market for a pubes trimmer, here are some criteria that our experts recommend you consider: “It’s easiest to shave skin that is taut, which the scrotum decidedly isn’t,” Dr. Turner explains. “However, that doesn’t mean you want the scrotum to be tight when shaving, as it might be when you’re cold, for instance.” Here’s how he explains to go through the motions—and it starts with an awareness of a certain muscle in that area. So, you’ve got the cremaster muscle (that muscle you can sense internally, which raises and lowers the testes). Dr. Turner says this muscle helps regulate the balls’ temperature and promotes healthy sperm. “When the cremaster contracts, the scrotum becomes more textured and wrinkled, which will make shaving more difficult. I’d recommend shaving in the shower or just outside it. In addition to helping to soften coarse pubic hair, warm water will help relax the cremaster muscle. This will leave the skin smooth and make it easier to manipulate the scrotum as you shave.” Balls aside, how do you approach shaving the rest of your pubes? “Whatever you do, if it’s your first time shaving this area, you have to debulk most of the hair before going straight for the razor,” Dr. Turner says. “It’s just like a traditional haircut—if you’re going for a buzz cut after having a lot of length, you’ll need to use scissors to cut the hair down to a length that the other blades can manage easily.” Dr. Turner says to firsttrimthe hair as short and as close to the skin as you can. Then, shower and cleanse the area before you shave. “Choose a very hydrating and lubricating shaving cream,” he adds. Take things slowly, and shave with the grain of hair growth (if possible, at those odd angles); this will prevent ingrown hairs better than if you shave against the grain of growth since those pubes tend to be extra curly and coarse. For the balls, be sure to heed Dr. Turner’s advice from above. After shaving, make sure to apply a breathable layer of moisturizer, “to help repair the skin barrier from the mechanical exfoliation of the shaving process,” says Dr. Turner. “Moisturizing can also help to reduce friction that can further irritate. In fact, you might want to additionally consider ananti-chafingstick or balm to lubricate this sensitive area.” What is the best pubic hair trimmer for men, according toGQ? GQ’s pick for best pubic hair trimmer is Happy Nuts’ Lumberjack Trimmer, a terrific manscaping device that offers a generous range of trimming lengths, as well as a respectable charge-to-runtime ratio. Will trimming pubic hair help reduce odor in the groin area? “Debulking your pubic hair can promote better air circulation, making the groin feel less hot, which may help to reduce how much you sweat and keep you more comfortable throughout your day,” explains Dr. Turner. How can you prevent chafing on shaved skin? To prevent chafing, do your best to keep the area of skin dry, and from rubbing against other parts of your body, as well as rough/tight fabric. Dr. Turner suggests using a dedicated anti-chafing balm in the area, too, “so that the skin glides past itself” as opposed to any rubbing and tugging. What does body hair do? It’s worth understanding the role ofbody hairin the first place—just in case you want to factor in anything beyond pure aesthetics. “One of the purposes of pubic hair specifically is to help reduce friction during intercourse as hair passes over hair, acting as a ‘dry lubricant,’” says Dr. Turner. Body hair can also help regulate your body temperature, and Dr. Turner adds that it can also serve as a layer of protection against the outside world, “acting as a line of defense against potentially harmful bacteria”—like soft non-barbed wire coating your skin. But in the groin area, the propensity for sweating (and the notable lack of sunshine) are the perfect recipe for body odor. “Pubic hair is typically quite thick and if there’s a lot of it, the sweat will take longer to evaporate. The longer the sweat is on your body, the more the bacteria can grow, increasing body odor,” adds Dr. Turner. “The sweat glands in the pubic area release sweat that is thicker, containing lipids and proteins, giving the bacteria on your skin food, encouraging growth.” All that to say: It makes sense why some guys want to significantly trim the hedges—and why others choose to remove hair altogether. Ultimately, though, the choice is yours. I’ve been in the product-testing business for 11 years and each year I'm sent dozens of devices, the best of which you'll see here. I selected Happy Nuts’ Lumberjack Trimmer as my number one pick for its range of trimming lengths and for its impressive charge-to-runtime ratio. You’ll get good battery life, precision, comfortable handling, and a waterproof tool at that. It is an aptly named brand—I’m big on theiranti-chafe cream, too. Dr. Ryan Turner, MD, is a board-certified NYC dermatologist and co-founder ofTRNR Skin. Like any top doc, Turner has seen every kind of skin malady and concern, with “carpet burn” being a popular repeat offender. Let his expertise prevent you from a future doctor visit too; folliculitis and shave cuts are never fun, especially on your junk.

    "title": "Spike Lee Just Posted the 'Highest 2 Lowest' Teaser With Denzel Washington Early",
    "article_text": "“There’s more to life than just making money. There’s integrity, there’s what you stand for. There’s what you actually believe in,”Denzel Washingtontells us over the indelible bassline of James Brown’s revenge classic “The Payback.” It’s the first line spoken in the newly releasedHighest 2 Lowestteaser trailer, which that immediately spammed my timeline the moment it wassurprise-dropped on Spike Lee’s IG grida day earlier than its planned release. And for good reason, because it certainly appears that, at long last, we got one. Yes, theHighest 2 Lowestteaser was technically supposed to drop tomorrow, but apparently Spike couldn’t wait another 24 hours to show us what he’s cooked up with his lifetime friend and collaborator after the near 20-year break the director and actor took since 2006’sThe Inside Man. It’s an electrifying 51 seconds which gives us much to unpack, built around a propulsive motif of the photo negative Brooklyn Bridge, seemingly seen from inside a convertible speeding across it. (Possibly the Rolls Royce Phantom we briefly see pull up to a curb, and later shot up.). Spike is specifically introduced as the director of theDenzel classicsMo’ Better Blues,Malcolm X,He Got Game, andInside Man, reminding us that every single time this alliance of filmmaker and actor get together, they make classics. Even though we’ve been toldA$AP Rockyis the star of the film, Denzel is the narrator—addressing the themes of capitalism’s crush ported from Akira Kurosawa’s 1963 source material—and fulcrum of the teaser (including what looks like the mandatory trademark double dolly shot, with Denzel bathed in red light).As we anticipated, his character’s work as a record executive appears to play a prominent role in the film. We see him suave as fuck, swaggering through a corporate office lined with framed platinum records and walking the aforementioned Brooklyn Bridge with what looks like chunky gold Beats headphones on. He’s in full Denzel command here—with echoes of John Creasy, Frank Lucas, and even Malcolm Little—as a slick and chatty high powered executive. The kidnapping and procedural element of the plot—lifted from Kurosawa’s original—is unfurled via speeding NYPD SUVs, cops working around surveillance equipment in a crisis room, manicured stacks of 1000 Swiss Franc banknotes, and a news report featuring a shot of the actor Bryshere Y. Gray. Gray, who played a rapper onEmpireand had not previously been announced as part of the cast, is seen on television as Denzel and a character who looks to be his wife, played by Ilfenesh Hadira, look on from a couch in alarm. Gray appears to be playing Trey King,Jeffrey Wright’scharacter’s (seen in the trailer with a bushy salt and pepper goatee, oozing with gravitas) mistakenly kidnapped son. There are several cuts to what looks like the drop of those ransomed banknotes in a duffel bag that’s handled by Denzel on a subway train, dropped between cars, and traded off by masked riders on mopeds. It appears the events take place around June’s annual Puerto Rican Day Parade, with flags waving everywhere in the trailer, a reminder thatit’s been 13 years(depending on how you qualify the limited city time we get in 2014’s mostly Martha’s Vineyard-setDa Sweet Blood of Jesus) since one of New York City’s great storytellers has actually shot a film in his hometown. Lee has been on a late period run over the last decade, but by re-teaming with Denzel and returning to New York, this has the looks of the classic Spike Lee Joint we’ve been clamoring for. While I’d love to be taking in the film’s premiere atCannesin two weeks, I’ll likely watchHighest 2 Lowestas most of the obsessive nerds who have read this entire primer will: in a packed independent theater on its August 22nd release. The final line in the trailer is Denzel asking, “Can you handle it?” And if he’s referring to the interminable time I am going to have to wait to see this film, the answer is a resoundingno.",

    "title": "Met Gala 2025: Four Celebrity Stylists on Keeping the Black Dandy Alive",
    "article_text": "It’s the first Monday in May, which meansthe Met Gala—the annual fundraising event for the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute—is officially upon us.This year’s theme, “Tailored For You,” is based on the forthcoming exhibition,“Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,”which examines the emergence of the Black dandy and their impact in and on culture throughout history. Dandyism is a way of being that is laser-focused on aesthetics as it pertains to self-presentation, expression, curation, and how those things contribute to how he or she moves about the world. The concept of dandyism permeates culture today, but not always in the most traditional spirit of the word. In popular culture, many of our most visible fashion figures call on stylists to help lead them to their truest forms of self-expression. In regards to dandyism, a stylist can identify and provide its core tenants to their client, but it’s the spirit of the wearer that takes it beyond “just clothes.” “When you wear clothes, you’re showing your perspective and you’re giving people a message of who you are,” saysMobolaji Dawodu, stylist andGQ’s fashion director at large. Dawodu’s perspective doesn’t rely on trends, but still feels observant of the changes and the shifts happening in culture. He’s putPharrell Williamsin crew-cuffed caps, bathedTrevor Noahin green suede, and uses an eclectic array of prints and vibrant colors in editorials that support his own interpretation of the modern-day dandy. “What you wear is your armor. That’s why clothing is so important,” he says. “Dandyism is, more than anything, presentation, and everything that makes you feel special, that makes you feel seen, and that makes you look and feel fly.” Pharrell Williams onGQ's September 2023 cover, styled by Mobolaji Dawodu. For celebrity stylist Jason Bolden, dandyism is a lifestyle above all. “It’s a classic, curated personal lifestyle that you get to sing out loud with,” he says. He maintains a sleek aesthetic on his clients likeDwyane WadeandMichael B. Jordanwhile still pushing the envelope. At a recent premiere for Jordan’s latest filmSinners, Bolden outfitted Jordan in a navy-and-red pinstriped Dolce & Gabbana suit with an inverted collar and ultra-wide trousers. The details managed to subvert the tenets of classic tailoring without sacrificing elegance. To Bolden, dandyism isn’t marked by “a fabrication or a textile, or a shape or a fit.” Instead, he says, “it's in the scope of it all—you look at someone likeJames Baldwinto a Sydney Poitier to a Duke Ellington. You can even go all the way to the current moments of an Andre 3000. I think the manifestation today is more about personal style and point of view.” Michael B. Jordan on theSinnersred carpet, styled by Jason Bolden. Matthew Henson, who styles major stars likeThe Weekndand A$AP Rocky, says, “I think one of the most important aspects to consider for the gala specifically, it draws off of a part of the obvious fact that dandyism is a big part of the historical fabric of style, men’s style, black style, style and fashion in general.” Rocky (who serves as one of the co-chairs of this year’s gala, along with Pharrell Williams,Colman Domingo,Lewis Hamilton, and Anna Wintour) is the quintessential modern-day dandy, whose elegant style is injected with an edginess influenced by his Harlem upbringing. “I think it's really important to take some of those elements as inspiration to do something new and something modern because I feel like we all know and understand what it looks like from a historical context,” Henson continues. “It's really beautiful and we should be celebrating that, but I do think what's really important is to keep the legacy of dandyism going, advancing it, making it modern, and using all of the context to do something new and fresh.” A$AP Rocky in a pair of crisp tailoring looks, styled by Matthew Henson. No stranger to sharp suiting that pushes the boundaries, the celebrity stylist and founder of Aliétte, Jason Rembert has embraced suiting with a perspective of renewal rather than re-inventing the wheel. At the American Black Film Festival Honors in February, Rembert dressedNickel Boysactor Ethan Herissein a sharp Balmain suit blanketed with cosmic white embroidery. “I think the modern dandy is authentic, rebellious, and full of pride,” Rembert says. “We’ve seen it translate from the super refined and elegant button-up feel, to the hip-hop world.” “You look atAndré Leon TalleytoTyler, The Creator, who has this refinement but he also has this hip-hop edge, newness, and uniqueness that is true to their city or their upbringing. You know who they are as a person and their experiences,” he says. “There is a throughline of elegance and a throughline of, ‘I’m gonna put this shit on and I’m gonna be me.’ I admire the person that can wake up and say, ‘Y’all may not get it now, but in five years, you’re gonna get it.”’ Ethan Herisse at the American Black Film Festival Honors, styled by Jason Rembert. The Black dandy,in their many iterations throughout history, has had a hand in how we examine Black style, and how it subverts preconceived notions and stereotypes applied to the Black community, especially Black males. Think of even the gala celebrity co-chairs—Pharrell Williams, A$AP Rocky, Coleman Domingo, and Lewis Hamilton—who all represent dandyism on a spectrum. Though they have starkly different and highly-coveted personal styles, they carry the throughlines of confidence, autonomy, authority, and self-preservation. Modern day dandyism doesn’t rely on how well you can style a suit—it might not require a suit at all. It’s about the intangible things that money can’t buy: swagger, influence, attitude, and how one moves throughout the world. It is the antithesis of quiet luxury. It’s the biggest proclamation you can make about yourself before even opening your mouth to speak.",

    "title": "How to Solve Your Back Pain With Pilates and Swimming",
    "article_text": "A lot of us struggle with back pain, whether it’s aknot in the shoulder, atight lower back, kink in the neck, or generalized pain in difficult-to-reach locations. Eighty percent of us will experience lower back pain in our lifetime, according to the journalAnnals of Internal Medicine, resulting in time off work, reduced productivity, and loss of employment. What’s more, theUK Health and Safety Executive(HSE) found that 39 percent of all reported work-related musculoskeletal disorders were due to back pain between 2020-21. But we’re not powerless against back pain. We canstand up straight when we leave our desksand bend down without wincing. But how to do it without carrying afoam rollerand a jar of Advil everywhere? We called on experts to weigh in. “Low back pain is defined as pain in the back anywhere between the lower ribs and the buttock crease,” says Stephen Bowden, ergonomist specialist atMorgan Maxwell. “Acute low back pain is an episode that is shorter than six weeks in duration.” “In an era dominated byscreensand sedentary jobs, the prevalence of back pain has skyrocketed,” says Kieran Sheridan, co-founder and physiotherapist atGulfPhysio.com. “Tight hips, often a consequence of prolonged sitting, contribute significantly to back pain. The hip flexors, a group of muscles connecting the hip joint to the spine, can become chronically shortened, affecting the alignment of the pelvis and placing strain on the lower back. As we spend more time in seated positions, whether at work or during leisure, ourhip flexorsadapt to this posture, creating a domino effect that reverberates through the spine.” In other words: too much time at a desk and/or sitting around watching Netflix has a negative effect on our backs. It’s even harming our rest;researchershave found that back pain sufferers have greater chances of developinganxiety, stress, and experiencing poor sleep quality. There is hope. “The majority of low back pain events gradually improve and can be managed with treatment at home and self-care, usually within a few weeks,” says Bowden. Stretching should be your first move when it comes to dealing with persistent muscle pain, andPilatesis one of the best forms out there. Originally designed to keep dancers stage-ready, it’s a fantastic tool when it comes to staying loose. “Breaking free from the shackles of sedentary living requires a proactive approach,” says Sheridan. “Incorporating active stretching—known for its significant impact on injury prevention and muscle performance—is needed to form long term flexibility gains and thus avoid preventable muscular atrophy.” Loads of studies back this up, including research published in theJournal of Applied Physiology, which found that active stretching supports muscle performance and reduces risk of injury. “Unlike quick stretches that provide a temporary solution, active stretching contributes to long-term flexibility gains, making it a preferred choice for those seeking sustained improvements in range of motion and overall musculoskeletal health,” Sheridan explains. Sheridan backs Pilates as a fantastic way to promote core strength, flexibility, and controlled movements. “It’s a great, low-impact, targeted solution for individuals seeking relief from back discomfort, and something you can easily do at home,” he says. A2017 studyfound swimming reduces your risk of early death by a staggering 28 percent and helps us stay mentally and physically fit into old age. If you’ve pulled your back in the gym—or simply sat too long at work—a few lengths in the poolcan do wonders for your recovery. Swimming is the ultimate low-impact recovery exercise. For Bowden, it’s a great way to keep your back supple and prevent pain while also strengthening and improving fatigue resistance in your back muscles. “Swimming, with its full-body engagement and gentle impact on joints, stands out for its potential to alleviate back pain through improved mobility and cardiovascular benefits,” says Sheridan. “The dynamic movements in swimming may offer a unique advantage for those seeking a holistic approach to back pain relief.” Both Bowden and Sheridan agree that accessibility and personal preference should decide whether you focus on swimming or Pilates—both are a great way to loosen your hips, strengthen your back, and generally banish any troublesome knots. Sheridan has put together the following seven-day plan. Don’t worry if you don’t have time for everything—just aim for a good mix of strengthening andflexibilityexercises and you’ll soon see improvements. Monday: Core Strengthening“One hour of alternatingHIIT trainingand weight-lifting. Make sure you do not go above your capacity and ask a professional to guide you through the proper usage of gym facilities.” Tuesday: Cardiovascular ExerciseSwimming(30 minutes): Low-impact cardiovascular exercise to improve overall fitness without stressing the back.Followed by brisk walking(20-30 minutes): Promotesblood circulationand helps maintain a healthy weight. Wednesday: Flexibility and StretchingDynamic Stretching(10-15 minutes): Arm circles, leg swings, and hip circles to prepare the body for movement. Pilates or reformer Pilates is great. Thursday: Strength TrainingDeadlifts(3 sets of 10 reps): Builds strength in the lower back and hamstrings.Lat Pulldowns(3 sets of 12 reps): Strengthens the upper back and shoulders.Bridges(3 sets of 15 reps): Targets the glutes and lower back. Friday: Cardiovascular ExerciseCycling(30 minutes): Low-impact exercise that enhances cardiovascular fitness without straining the back. Saturday: Rest or Gentle ActivityEngage in light activities such aswalkingor gentle stretching to promote recovery and avoid overexertion. Sunday: Mind-Body ConnectionPilates(30-40 minutes): Focuses on core strength and controlled movements.Meditation (10-15 minutes): Reduces stress and promotes relaxation, which can positively impact back pain. A more active approach is key to undoing the damage of our sedentary, desk and sofa-bound existences. If you don’t have time for the weekly plan above, there are other tricks you can try on the go: This story originally appeared inBritish GQ.",

    "title": "The Real-Life Diet of Tony Cavalero From 'Righteous Gemstones', Who Loves a Bulgarian Split Squat Set of Death",
    "article_text": "On HBO’s irreverent megachurch comedyThe Righteous Gemstones, Tony Cavalero playsKeefe Chambers, who escaped Satanism to worship at the altar ofAdam Devine’s character, the inimitable Kelvin Gemstone. In that role, Cavalero sports a mullet and a 666 tattoo on his chest. In real life, he’s a calorie counter and a bit of a muscle head. A self-described onetime chubby kid, Cavalero no longer evokes portly ‘90s comedy legends. He’s shredded now, thanks to five weekly gym sessions and healthy doses of creatine. Cavalero leaves plenty of room for fun, though. A lax bro in college, the 41-year-old actor continues toplay lacrosserecreationally, and when he called in for this interview, he was sipping out of aBig Gulp. (It just goes to show—you can become a vision of fitness and still ingest comically large amounts of sugary fizz.) For Cavalero, getting serious about his health didn’t mean avoiding 7/11, it meant getting in the sauna, discovering egg whites and low-carb tortillas, and picking up some saccharine pre-workout habits. He didn’t even need a televangelist nepo baby to guide him. Tony Cavalero:I was a fat little kid, man. I was like 210 pounds my freshman year of high school. So, I was a little porker. I actually made a name for myself, because my brother was a senior when I was a freshman in high school, and he'd introduce me to the senior girls and be like, “This is my little brother, Tony. He weighs 210 pounds and he does an amazing Chris Farley impression.” I’d do that wholepet scene fromTommy Boy, where he crushes the biscuit. But that being said, I was always very active. My parents put me in dance [class] when I was like five years old. Then, of course,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtlescame out. I did Taekwondo for like a decade. Then, I got to high school and [entered] full jock mode with football, wrestling, and lacrosse. [I was] pretty much addicted to sports. I really wanted to playDivision 1 lacrosse, so I got laser-focused on that and ended up going to play at the Virginia Military Institute. I was really dialed-in with strength training and exercise and moving my body. There's never been a time in my life, really, where I wasn't doing some kind of physical activity at all times. The cool thing is, when I moved to LA and I started doing improv and sketch comedy, all of that physicality lent itself to my comedy. It gave me a unique point of view and perspective. I was always the one dancing on stage, or throwing himself through a table, or falling through boxes, or doing pull-ups on stage. Chris Farley, Jack Black, those guys and what they did with their bodies was such an inspiration for me. My background in martial arts and dance and sports allowed me to do some things that not everybody could do. I wrestled my sophomore year [of high school] and I weighed 171 [pounds]. Once I started wrestling, it came off. But I've never been super lean. That's a new thing that happened for me. It's funny, like I said, I've always done lots of activities, physical fitness, everything. But I really didn't learn about diet, honestly, until like the last year and a half. I found out what acalorie deficitis, how much water you really need to be drinking, what yourfiber intakeneeds to be. The weight does not come off me easy. We are a husky family, the Cavaleros. Last year I was prepping for a movie right before Gemstones. I wanted to have a really radically different look, and so I dropped about 15 pounds. It was supposed to be this really cool thriller with Owen Wilson and Woody Harrelson. I was going to play an ex-con and I had to look pretty scary. My comp in my mind was Robert De Niro inCape Fear, so I dropped all this weight. Then the financing fell through on the movie and it didn't happen. So, I showed up forGemstoneson my first day and they're like, “Dude, you're so ripped. Are you cool? You're going to have to be this way basically the whole season.” Honestly, I had already been dialed in. I was doingmeal prepand I had been doingintermittent fasting. I tried everything, dude. Keto, all of that stuff. Really, ultimately what matters is calorie counting. I do it on an app on my phone, but it makes it so much easier if you have a few meal-prep meals already handy. Then, just make sure you havehigh-protein, health-conscious snacks and mealsin the fridge. I know it sounds weird, but there's a company, MuscleEgg, that sends me gallons of egg whites that are flavored. If I'm in a pinch, a cup is like 120 calories and almost 30 grams of protein. The other things are staying hydrated and fiber intake. We don't get enough fiber! I'm such a weirdo, dude. I have low-carb tortillas on hand, always, and now I'm obsessed with keto bread. They say our abs are made in the kitchen, and I think last year when I was prepping for that movie, I really found out what kind of deficit I needed to be in to actually drop the weight. I’m 15 years sober, and that’s obviously been a big part of my health journey. I don't have to worry about what kind of calories I'm consuming with beers or mixed drinks or wine or any of that stuff, which is good. But still, in my mind I'm like, Well, I'm not drinking so I should be fine. Long story short, the weight does not come off easy, it's hard to keep off, and it's hard work. The other thing that's silly, when I first got sober, I ran like 11 marathons. The last year and a half I've gotten really addicted to traditional bodybuilding-style workouts. I got addicted to hot yoga for like three years. Now I'm in a place where I want to do what makes my body feel good. That usually consists of five days at the gym, one daydoing yoga, and then another day of doing some jump rope and mobility or going on a hike with friends. My wife and I always walk the dogs. We're both on this whole 10,000 steps a day thing. That's what everybody's preaching. Forever, I was trying to chase my diet with cardio. Now I know I don't want to have to spend two hours on the elliptical when I can just not have three cookies after dinner. I'm going to have one and not have to worry. Yeah. What was also an impetus for me? A year and a half ago, I was just doing my normal physical [check-up]—as I do now that I'm a responsible 40-plus-year-old—and my blood work came back. I was anemic, which was weird. We did all these tests and ran everything, and the doctor's just like, Yeah, man. You hit 40. I think it may just be genetic. It was, like, a refocus moment. That means I need to get my blood checked more often. I need to stay on top of these things. I want to be able to do all kinds of physical activities until I can't anymore. You know what I mean? I want to be able to do this for another 41 years. I still play lacrosse in Charleston with a little club team. It's kind of cool, I just hooked upDanny [McBride]and his son with a cool lacrosse coach out there. So, Danny's kiddo's picking up a stick and falling in love with lacrosse, too. I’ve never done Pilates with him. But I did do Pilates a few times because one of our directors, David Green, is obsessed with Pilates. Oh boy. I mean, hot yoga has its moments, too, when you're holding poses. But Pilates, dude! The only thing I can compare it to is wrestling. There's a little bit of that exhaustion from wrestling practice. I’ve never beenthatexhausted in my life. I mean, sore in places I didn't even know existed. Now I'm at a place where I try to do Pilates or yoga once a week because mobility is so important. My wife is hilarious. We'll go out to dinner with friends, or to a party, and one of her most favorite things is, “Hey, Tony can do a toe touch. You want to see?” She'll make me do jump splits in front of everybody. That was my party trick for years, and I still want to be able to do that. Yeah, dude. I always like working out with a workout partner. Usually inCharlestonit's Adam. We have a few awesome gyms out there. Today, I hit chest, some triceps and a little bit of rear delts. I'm a typical meathead. I'm using Chris Bumstead's offseason workout split right now. Sick. I love that. Sweet! The other thing with the meal prep that's so great is that my wife and I, we're big foodies. Charleston, man, I think it’s the best food in the country. There's some of our favorite restaurants there. So, like I said, having that meal prep at home, you can do a meal prep meal forbreakfastand lunch, and then go out and have dinner with your friends and not feel crazy. You're like, I've already been so good my first two meals of the day! I can go out and have a caviar sandwich at Chubby Fish, or fried chicken at Edmund's, or back here in LA, Sushi at Katsuya, or a burger at Burger She Wrote. And again, as long as you're tracking your calories, you can still eat the things that you love. I am one of those guys—I went to military school—I'm a glutton for punishment. Some people hateleg days, and I'm like, Yes, I'm going to wear the shortest shorts imaginable and just punish myself. We do a finisher called the Bulgarian split squat drop set of death. Very chill, dude. Very chill. Dude, I am a soda guy. There's all these studies,aspartame is bad for you. Well, I have to drink like 30 sodas for it to actually be bad for me. At least that’s what Instagram tells me. I definitely drink soda. And then, I’ve got Lean Body protein shakes. Do you want a run of the supps [supplements]? I do creatine, five to 10 grams a day. I do a little pre-workout. Another company I love is Panda. They're awesome. I'll do their protein shakes, and then I'll do some collagen. I was working on this boxing movie withSydney Sweeney, and she had a personal trainer there. I was like, all right, dude. Give me some tips that I wouldn't know. He was like, are you doing any kind of dextrose in your pre-workout? \"No.\" And he's like, yeah, just [take] a scoop of corn sugar. Sometimes bodybuilders will eat gummy bears or whatever when they work out, for their glycogen levels. So, I do a scoop of that in there. It's like 45 calories, but it supposedly gives you a little boost while you're in the gym, gives you some good carbs, some good sugar to keep you going for those longer workouts, because I'm usually there about an hour and a half. I'll do a post-workout shake. Really, I try and hit thatone gram of proteinper one pound of your goal body weight. I’d say late-night snacking is my main vice. That’s when hunger really hits. I am trying, as of late, no more food after 8:00. That’s really tough for me. If it's in the house, man, that temptation is there. Usually what I try to do is time it out. [My] family was here, it was like, okay, I need to get the right amount ofdoughnuts, so there aren't four left over. I remember having a call with the director, Jeff Tremaine. He was like, it's perfect, because Ozzy was kind of husky at this time in his life. Come on, dude! I think I was 34 when I shot that, and during the time period in the movie, Ozzy was 34. If you look at photos of him versus me at that time, we were basically in the exact same shape. Like I said, I'm 15 years sober, so I had a lot of previous experience to draw from for that movie. 100% dude. There’s a company, Hooga, they do panels, face masks, the whole nine yards. If it’s woo woo, who cares? It’s 20 minutes. I put it on my head for hair health, put it on my face to look younger. What's the downside? They're not very expensive. Like, why not? I mean, I'm in showbiz, man. I got to take care of this face and keep these luscious locks. Bro, 100%. I’m all about it. I have acold plunge, a portable one. Anywhere I go, I am definitely doing sauna and cold plunge. I'll do 25 minutes in the sauna, and then I'll do three minutes in the cold plunge—somewhere between like 35 and 45 degrees. I love to go straight from the cold plunge right to the gym, because you feel like you are shot out of a rocket for the first half hour of your workout. It takes you forever to warm up, and I feel like it gives you almost another added pre-workout bonus. I don't entirely know the science behind cold plunge, but I love the way it makes me feel. Like I said, I think I'm a glutton for punishment. There's some kind of mental aspect to that. But I do know there's all kinds of study with sauna. Norwegian people, I know there's a study where it's like, [they have] 30% less chance of dementia. So, I'm very strict about sauna. No. I can make something better at home. I'm pretty simple: scoop of protein, some Fairlife milk, a chopped up, super ripe banana, and either some peanut butter powder or some peanut butter. Make that thing extra thick. You can’t go wrong. Maybe even throw some Himalayan sea salt in there. The other one, dude, is slice a banana in half—but long ways—and lay it face up. You put a littlepeanut butteron top of the banana, coat it in cinnamon, and cook at 350 for five minutes in the air fryer. Then put some honey on it afterwards. I did it last night. I'm telling you, it is like the best, sweetest fried plantains. It's delicious.

    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. For well over a decade, J. Mueser, the bespoke tailoring shop founded by Jake Mueser in 2008, has outfitted the city’s pickiest sartorialists. Mueser starting sewing as a teenager, and ever since opening the doors of his Manhattan fitting-room-cum-haberdashery, he’s helped countless flummoxed dudes walk out inexacting suitscut with natural American shoulders, natty English ticket pockets, and generous Italian lapels. Much like New York itself, Mueser’s suits are ahodgepodge of influencesfar greater than the sum of their parts—especially when you factor in the accoutrements he now sells alongside them. Mueser’s world-class bespoke program might be the brand headliner, but his expansive range of ready-to-wear—crisppoint-collar shirts, classic-leaning sweaters, killer off-the-rack suits—is no understudy. The one downside? Until recently, the whole lot of it was exclusively available via the brand’s West Village shop or in limited quantities on its own webstore. (The West Village is scenic and all, but it requires a little bit of planning to get to; I’m roughly 25 minutes away door-to-door, and the trip already sounds arduous.) J. Mueser Mr. Porter J. Mueser Mr. Porter I say “was”, though, because that’s no longer the case. A few weeks ago, the savvy Brits at Mr Porter brought J.

The house-speciality Waverly Suit, which the brand offers in five colors, starts with a jacket that’s svelte but not severe, in both a single-breasted three-roll-two withnotch lapelsor a double-breasted6x2with peak lapels. The matching trousers feature a high rise, straight leg, and flat or pleated fronts, depending on the design. (If you just need to upgrade your summer slacks, you can buy ‘em as separates.)

Now, of course, is right around the time when we might sheepishly mention that this stuff isn’t cheap. It isn’t: a full suit will run you close to $2,000.

    "title": "‘The Last of Us’ Brought Another Iconic Moment From the Games to Life",
    "article_text": "Spoilers for this week’s episode ofThe Last of Usbelow Ellie (Bella Ramsey) and Dina (Isabela Merced) have found love in a hopeless place. This week’s installment ofThe Last of Ussees the pair, on the hunt for Abby (Kaitlyn Dever), enter into the lush, overgrown city of Seattle without totally understanding what they’re getting into. As an intense cold open featuring the introduction of Isaac (Jeffrey Wright, reprising his role from the game) shows us, the duo is smack dab in the middle of an ongoing war between the WLF and the Seraphites. Oh, and there are still cordyceps zombies running around. The episode, written by series co-creator Craig Mazin and directed by Kate Herron, allows for plenty of quiet moments and massive reveals amongst the warring factions—and for the long-simmering love between Ellie and Dina to blossom. After a harrowing sequence where Ellie gets bitten, she tells Dina about her immunity to the virus, and Dina responds that she’s pregnant before the two finally kiss. It’s a small ray of light in what’s otherwise been a bleak season for these characters. Herron, no stranger to telling queer stories within genre fiction via her work onLoki,Doctor Who, andSex Education, felt an extra level of pressure to make sure she nailed the episode given its massive importance to the story of the season. Ahead of the episode’s premiere, Herron jumped on Zoom to chat with GQ about how her love of the game got her in position to direct the episode, staging the episode’s massive action sequence, what it was like to work with Ramsey and Merced for those big emotional moments, and much more. GQ:How did this opportunity first come your way? Kate Herron:I honestly reached out to them. I did know the DP, Eben Bolter, from season one, who put a good word in for me, which is very nice of him. During lockdown, I bought aPlayStation. I'd only playedNintendogames, and I texted all my friends that loved PlayStation and was like, \"Hey, what should I play?\" I was filmingLoki[Season One], living on my own inAtlanta, and I was like, \"I'm going to get really into games and I'm going to try this\" — as in PlayStation games.The Last of Uswas at the top of everyone's list. I played the first game, the prequel, and then the second game came out. All the games completely blew my mind in terms of what a game could be in terms of what it said about empathy and video gaming. Even simple things, like the people you were going after had names. I was like, \"Wow.\" I remember thinking the characters were beautifully written. The way it moved me—when Joel died in the second game, I hadn't lived with those games for as long as people [who] had played them for years, but I felt like someone I knew had died [laughs]. I was like, \"Wow, okay.\" It had a profound effect upon me, that game. I remember at the time they were making the first season, and I was so excited to see that. Anyway, cut to obviously after the first season, and I meet them for the second season. The amazing thing was, I was so nervous, so I was early for the call. But Neil [Druckmann] was also really early, and so I just got to talk to him on Zoom. It felt like so much longer [but] it was probably five minutes, but I remember just thinking in my head, \"Look, if I don't get this job, I got to talk to Neil Druckman for five minutes and that was really cool.\" [laughs] When I met them, I was showing them I had a vinyl from the game, the soundtrack from the first season. I have a statue of Ellie in my office back in England. I had a lot of stuff, and I was like, \"Look, I love the game. This is what I love about it.\" I loved the TV show because I found it so interesting—the places where they stuck to the game, but also where they've expanded or surprised us and done different things. Then they were like, \"Yes, we would love you to direct on it.\" I later found out that I'd be directing episode four, which I was thrilled about. What was it like to step into the show at such a critical point? There’s a lot going on in this episode. Even in the wake ofepisode two—this is just as important as that one, but for different reasons. I was excited, but I was also like, \"Okay, I have to make sure that I get this right.\" For me, this is an episode that gets you on board, or at least along for the ride at the beginning, with Ellie and Dina's decision to go to Seattle to avenge Joel's death. That was really important. And also introducing us to this whole new part of the world that we haven't seen before. Ellie and Dina, they don't quite know what they're going into. They don't realize that they're going into the middle of this war. They don't know exactly who the WLF are. They dunno who the Seraphites are. It's very important to give them hints of, yes, they've met very dangerous people before, but the people they're dealing with here are just as dangerous, if not more dangerous, and more dangerous than the infected, at times. That was very key to establish here. Then obviously Ellie and Dina's relationship, and also Isaac. There was a lot to introduce and a lot to launch in this episode, but I was very up for the challenge. The Last of Usdirector Kate Herron on set Speaking of Jeffrey Wright, that's a hell of an introduction, both in terms of the cold open and then his cooking scene. That interrogation, in particular, is already intense. What were the conversations between you, Craig, and Neil about how you wanted to address it tonally? In terms of the second scene, it was important to see Isaac, see what he's done to this person and you're like, \"I don't know. He doesn't seem like a completely good guy.\" I think you should be afraid, because you need to feel afraid of Isaac. He is the direct threat to Ellie and Dina. He's in charge, and that's very important to seed. This is what he's capable of, it's harrowing, and it also gives you a sense of the war that's happening and how both sides feel. It is a very heavy scene to film, and it also gives you insight into Isaac's mind. This person is quite ruthless in getting what information they want, and if they don't get what they want, this is what the consequences are going to be. Froma framing standpoint, the exterior shots feel more stable than the interior shots, which are handheld. What was the process behind that approach? We're handheld across the show, but there was definitely a level of the camera feeling, not necessarily always on Steadicam, but definitely a sense of [it]. When they're outside, you have these amazing views of the city. That was always very important to me, in terms of capturing how the game felt. I remember going into Seattle and being blown away by these epic apocalyptic landscapes. That was important, across the show, to find those moments. Where do we bring scale in? So many of the scenes are inside, and these intimate conversations, whether that's Ellie playing \"Take on Me,\" which is a much more joyful scene, or yes, an interrogation inside a kitchen. That is the thing that I enjoyed about this episode: you are getting so many private moments with all these characters, so it has to feel quite intimate. But yes, obviously, anytime I could [I wanted to] remind people that no, they're in this incredible-looking apocalyptic wasteland. Those visuals really stood out. And not that the show hasn’t paid attention to the production design before, but there’s an added level of care that comes with having to establish Seattle for the first time. Like in the shop when you’re spotlighting all those records. For me, I love the game, and I would pick up everything I could and go look at it. Craig and me are very similar in that we're very detail-oriented people, and he writes such great descriptions in his scripts. I'd be like, “Great, I'm going to try and film it then.” The music shop, like you said, our production design is amazing. I didn't want to waste that. I love all that texture, and there's something so cool about them going to this forgotten Seattle, particularly because we obviously see a very different Seattle in our world. I was like, \"What would that look like?\" We wanted this overgrown garden where Ellie plays guitar, and I remember saying, \"Oh, could I add a caterpillar because I think that would be cool?\" Craig was like, \"Yes!\" It's the kind of thing that you normally pitch, and you're like, \"They're never going to let me do that.\" But he was into it. That was the nice thing with Craig, it did feel very collaborative, but that's the joy of his writing, he's so detailed in everything, and with Neil, with the game as well, that it's such a detailed world. I loved that the more you explored the world, the more you got rewarded. The scene in the music shop is a really special moment. What was it like on set filming that sequence, and what went into it? For us, it was about getting the level of confidence right. There's so much going on for Ellie, because obviously, Joel and Ellie, the guitar is something that ties those two together emotionally. You can't help but feel that. Also, you've got these two characters who are grieving someone that they love still. That's still very heavy in the air. So to give them a moment—one way, yes, it feels very like these two young people. Like, who doesn't want to play guitar for their crush? You know what I mean? That felt very sweet. But for me, the actors, and Craig, it was honestly talking about [the] why. I remember talking to Bella, and they agreed, and I was like, \"Why don't we do a take where you don't make eye contact with Dina? You're just a bit shy.\" So I had a shy take, and then I did some that were more confident. We always knew the emotional space that we wanted to sit in, but as a director, you're always going to try and get all these different options. Cause that's why you film it, right? Then, in the edit, you have a chance to work out the right level for it. For us, it was just such a joy to film. It was weirdly one of those scenes that was the most intimidating. I remember in the game, that's such an iconic moment. I was so excited I got that moment, but at the same time, I was like, \"Okay, I have to get this right.\" Was there any desire to play around with the structure of how it looked? Did you consider doing it asa oner, or was it always going to be cut and edited the way it ended up? We hadn't ever planned it as a one-take. I think sometimes you might find those on the day, you'll be like, \"Oh, actually let's do this. It feels rhythmically correct for the scene.\" Or if it's a big action scene and you're like, \"Yeah, let's just go for it and try andChildren of Menthis.\" For the \"Take on Me\" scene, no. I always think of that image from the game, that's really iconic of Ellie playing the guitar in that space. I wanted to match that shot. Other than that, for me, it was always about making sure the emotions felt grounded and real. With any adaptation, particularly, for example, a completely different mood, but the subway sequence. We're doing something very different to the game there. The challenge for me there was remembering how I felt. The TV station scene, that's set during the day in the game, and in our show it's at night, but I loved that it was at night. For me, it's way more scary. It makes me way more intimidated by the WLF and the Seraphites at the same time. It was really important, in that moment, that Ellie and Dina felt very intimidated by this war that they'd walked into and aware that they have no idea what exactly is happening between these people. With the subway, I had the time of my life planning that. I remember saying to Craig—I got to do a jump scare inLoki, but obviouslyLoki’s a very different tone. I was like, \"Can I add a jump scare into this?\" He was like, \"Yes.\" Then I was just pitching him ideas, and we were building that together. It was just about capturing that adrenaline, tension, and that feeling ofI've got to get out of here. In the game, I remember being like, \"Wow, I've got to get through this as quickly as I can cause it's so dangerous, and feeling that for the characters as well. For me, it's always about capturing the mood of something and then bringing that into our world. Speaking of the subway sequence, that scene plays out differently in the game. You’re crawling through a vent overhead, just seeing and hearing it amongst these red flares. As a fan of the game, was finding a way to incorporate something you wanted to do for the setpiece? The red flares were always so important to me and Craig to incorporate. There was never a debate about whether it would be red flares or not. It was always just, yes, this is the red flare sequence. That was always set in stone, but obviously, we knew what we were doing would feel different. It's always that thing, if you're going to go away from the game, you have to give people something that feels worthwhile in doing that. For us, it was like, \"Okay, we're not going to do exactly what the game did, so let's give people a really exciting chase through the train.\" That's where we landed, basically, because the most key thing in that sequence is that Dina needs to believe Ellie is infected. There's this huge danger from the humans, and then you are like, \"Man, this is terrible. Let's go hide in the subway.\" Then it's like, \"Oh, wait, no, actually you forgot. There's a huge amount of infected as well that are also going to be an issue for you.\" It was a fun way to balance both threats to them. What were some of the challenges of working through the train sequence? I assume space is a big one. Oh gosh. I would say timing. In terms of, we are really shaking the train carriage. We're sending our actors through it. We've got a lot of stunt actors who are all brilliant, throwing themselves through windows, but obviously, with the nature of that, you can only do that so many times. For me, it was planning that sequence very, very heavily with my DP and being very clear and concise on exactly what me and Catie [Goldschmidt], the DP, wanted to do. The biggest challenge with any of those sequences, and also because sometimes you have to shoot stuff out of order, is as a director, knowing exactly how those are going to fit into the puzzle, essentially, once you're in the edit. That was logistically the most complicated thing, but luckily, we have a very good team. Is that one of the larger action sequences that you've shot? I knowLokihad its moments. Oh, yeah. For sure. The closest I had inLokiwas that oner around Lamentis in episode three. That's the closest I'd had in terms of scale, with stuff falling over, a huge amount of stunt actors running around. With all those sequences, honestly, because I'm such a planner, those sequences will go as smoothly as you plan them to go. That was very key for all of us, me and all the team. We got those train carriages early. We went in them, we had a look at them with our stunts team. The stunts team were pitching stuff for how they could move through, and it was a real collaboration. Everyone could see the intention of the shots and what I was thinking. With something like that, you're always planning. I had the time in my life. I love horror. I love that game, and I was just really excited to go on something like that. I was like, \"Now I get to show I could do this.\" How did you, Bella, and Isabela approach those reveals at the end of the episode? We took our time in discussing it. We did do quite a few takes on that. We got brilliant performances, but it was just about making sure. Bella, they were very focused on making sure that Ellie's emotion felt true in that sequence. That was something that was really important to all of us. You needed to feel that Ellie was really fighting for their life and believing that Izzy might shoot her as well because she doesn't know that Ellie is immune. Also, when Ellie says that, it's like \"That sounds like a lie someone would say if they were about to be shot.\" It was finding the right levels in that, and the moments when, oh, actually Dina does believe her now, but you don't know that. You don't know that until they kiss. I'd say, weirdly, that was one of our most challenging scenes to film because, yes, as you said, there's a lot of payoffs, but there's also a lot of trust on both sides. That was very important to give us time to find that together. Was there one particular moment, either from Isabella or Bella, that cracked open their interpretation of it? Or is it just the culmination of all of that discussion and planning? The culmination of it, because Bella and Izzy are such fantastic actors. I was every day, blown away by stuff they would do. Just their resilience, because obviously for so much of my episode I'm like, \"Okay, you're running this way, you're jumping on this, you're crawling.\" You throw them through the wringer. [laughs] Yeah! It's raining, it's night, and it's 3:00 AM, but we're having a good time. You know what I mean? It was always a surprise, every day, working with them. Not that I didn't know they were brilliant, but just because theyarebrilliant, so they're going to do stuff that always surprises you on camera. In terms of the emotion, yes, we had lots of long conversations with the three of us and Craig before, talking about the scripts and about the intention. By the time you were on set, we knew what we wanted to find, but it was giving ourselves the space and time to make sure we found it. Did you use an intimacy coordinator for the scene with Ellie and Dina? What did they bring to the sequence that was helpful? Yeah, we did. We had an intimacy coordinator for this sequence and also for the interrogation sequence with Isaac. They just help elevate the work and make sure that everyone feels comfortable with what we're doing. It's the same as if you have—I always think of a stunt choreographer, they're there to help make the action look awesome, but also keep people safe. It's the same with a dance choreographer as well. An intimacy coordinator is there to make sure that any intimacy feels grounded and truthful, but also that people can go home at the end of the day and feel as though it is work. And it should be. I think that everyone felt comfortable with what we filmed and keeping that conversation open, and that there's space for someone to be like, \"Actually, I wasn't sure about this. Could I watch it or see?\" I worked onSex Education, so I'd worked with a lot of intimate scenes on that TV show, so I'm quite well versed in it. I think they're so helpful. Tonally, this episode swings in a couple of different directions, between the love story and the action sequence. How are you trying to balance and manage those tones across the episode? For me, with tone, because I've done quite a lot of tonal jumping around, I always think about it like a music scale. You have to gradually build up to those moments. You can't get to the subway straight away. You need the TV station before that to earn the subway. \"Take on Me\" is this really quiet, intimate scene. But you don't get that without having them first walk through Seattle. There's a sense of unease because they see all the skeletons, but at the same time, there's a sense of, “Okay, they're definitely alone in this place.” So when they go into the music shop and that's happening with the song, we are not telling the audience to be scared there. We're telling them, “No, you can enjoy this with the characters because we've told you in this moment that they're not under threat.” With the tones, that's always what you're going to do. Then, you reset it. You cut to Jeffrey in a kitchen, and it's like, “Oh, actually, the tone has gone inthisdirection now.” For me, when stuff tonally sometimes feels jarring, it's when you're trying to put such different tones opposite each other, and that's where it can feel jarring. Whereas when you gradually build up to stuff, you can earn them more. In terms of you as a filmmaker, how important is it for you to be able to put your stamp on and help tell these kind of queer stories? Look, I was massively flattered and excited that they gave me episode four. I think that it's a massive privilege to get to tell stories like this because so often when I was growing up, most queer stories were in very specific queer media. There were a few in big mainstream shows, but not many. What's so exciting to me aboutThe Last of Usis that this is in a massive show that is watched by many people. At the center, you have these two characters, it's a queer love story, and it gives as much space as you would see for any other love story normally. It was a massive privilege and very exciting, and I'm very proud of the work. In the trajectory of your career so far, you’ve worked a lot in genre. What is it about genre that keeps you coming back to it or keeps you excited to play in those worlds? It's what I love watching. I've always been drawn to sci-fi and fantasy. I don't know, so many of my favorite films, like, I loveAlien, Starship Troopers, Galaxy Quest. They're all so different, those films I just listed, but I love fantastical worlds, a fantastical story, likeThe Princess Bride. I like the escapism of watching something like that, but then I'm always so led by character. If you're going to give me a world like that, give me a cool character that I can get on board with. Maybe they have an aspect of their personality, even though our lives are so different, that I can relate to, and I can be like, \"Oh, I understand this. They feel like that could be me.\" I love genre. It's so much fun. As a director, I've been very lucky. You walk on these sets and you feel like you're standing on an alien planet or in the middle of your favorite video game. I just love it. I'd be remiss if I didn't ask howThe Simswas coming along. Where are you in that process? We're all very excited about it. I'm busy writing on it, and we're just working away on it. But it's going well. Everyone's feeling very good and excited.",

    "title": "'The Last of Us:' The Haunting Significance of Joel’s Watch",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. As Ellie embarks on her journey to exact revenge on Joel’s killer inThe Last of Us, the decision all comes back to one involving a watch. In episode three last week, Ellie was presented with a box from Joel’s brother containing the former’s broken watch and his revolver. Showrunner Craig Mazin andThe Last of Uscreator Neil Druckmann have both spoken about how season two andThe Last of Us Part IIare about the perpetuation of cycles of violence. In receiving the watch, Ellie is offered the chance to stop the clock, to end the cycle, to take the high road rather than seek vengeance against Abbie for taking Joel from her. She doesn’t. She takes another object from the box: a gun. The clock ticks on. No one is doing more with timepieces than the prop masters on prestige television shows these days.On the most recent season ofThe White Lotus, each character’s watch provided additional clues to deciphering their characters—even the lack of a watch revealed how tuned in they were to the resort’s spiritual confines. And Ellie’s choice the previous Sunday was far from the first time Joel’s watch played a significant role onThe Last of Us. In both the game and the show, the timepiece ties back to Joel’s deceased daughter Sarah, who was tragically killed in the first episode of the series. In the game, the watch was a gift to Joel from his daughter to celebrate his birthday; while in the show, she got his old watch repaired for him. The watch doesn’t function for long, though. By the end of the very first episode of the series, it’s broken again and its crystal shattered. The message feels clear: time and life as he knows it have stopped for Joel. Still, he continues to wear it as a reminder of his daughter until his own death. The watch is just one standout piece fromThe Last of Us. Showrunner Mazin probably didn’t intend tocreate a modern menswear classic inThe Last of Usbut that’s exactly what he did. A certain kind of viewer–likely regular readers of this publication–can’t help but look at the sprawling post-apocalyptic America and wonder exactly which waxed jacket Pedro Pascal’s Joel is trekking through the wasteland in (it’s by Flint & Tinder and yes, it’scurrently in stock). The show is a treasure trove of hearty western and workwear, portraying a world in which clothing needs to be more form than fuction (not that the form isn’t sometimes off the charts). While Joel’s jacket gets the bulk of the love, eagle-eyed horological enthusiasts also warmed to his well-worn timepiece adorning his wrist throughout the show. Despite the piece being broken, it’s a constant in Joel’s wardrobe and has important ties to both his past and the show’s present. Talk about provenance! Joel’s watch is about what you’d expect from a dude forging his way through armies of Cordyceps creeps: a simple field watch with a NATO strap, no-frills, sturdy, and functional. At a quick glance it bears a resemblance to classic field watches like the Hamilton Khaki. From our best glimpses of the watch on the show we can see that it features a black dial with a subdial at 6 o’clock, Arabic numerals at 3, 6, and 9, and sword hands. However, it’s a bit hard to scope out details due to the crystal being permanently damaged (again, this is a guy fighting literal zombies–he’s not taking it in for servicing or anything). For those hoping to pick up one of their own, here’s the bad news: Joel’s watch is a custom piece designed by the prop masters ofThe Last of Us.Rather than pull a piece from a real-world brand, they built one that closely resembles the one Joel wears in the video games. While the game designers were drawing from real timepieces like the Lum-Tec Super Combat B2 (what’s been eyed as the closest IRL comp to Joel’s) what they created is ultimately a totally original and entirely unreal watch. The show, in turn, brought that unreal watch to life, albeit just for Pedro Pascal and, presumably, his stunt doubles. Some fans of the game, unsatisfied with only having a virtual version of the timepiece,recreated the watch in real life. A brand called MSTRpartnered with PlayStation and game developer Naughty Dog on a watch limited to just 1,000 pieces that’s now sold out. However, it’s not really about owning this watch. Joel’s timepiece is much more critical symbolically than it is as a design object. That’s what both the game and the show nailed: the way timepieces can take on immense emotional significance and signal not just our taste, but our very values and most cherished relationships.",

    "title": "Donald Trump’s Excuses Are Falling Flat",
    "article_text": "Donald Trumprecently hit the media circuit to make his case to, or perhaps, toplead withthe American people, aspolls showthe majority of them aren’t on board with his extreme agenda and chaotic course for the country. For someone who has called the media “really corrupt,” and hascomplainedthat news outlets “literally write 97.6 percent bad about me”—which, in his view, is surely “illegal”—Trump has been busy making the rounds with journalists, fromTheAtlantictoTime,ABCtoNBC. There is a lot to criticize when it comes to Trump and the media, like his authoritarian treatment of the White House press corps, such asbarringthe Associated Press for continuing to go with “Gulf of Mexico” over thePravda-esque “Gulf of America.” Still, Trump does a lot of interviews, which help reveal how he’s trying to create a narrative and shift public perceptions—and also provide a sense of where on earth his head is. Well, the results lately have been mind-blowing. Here’s one response from arguably the most powerful person in the world: “I don’t think a beautiful baby girl—that’s 11 years old—needs to have 30 dolls. They can have three dolls or four dolls,” hetoldNBC’sKristen Welkerover the weekend onMeet the Press,when defending his tariffs, adding, “They don’t need to have 250 pencils, they can have five.” Yes, this is the same guy who was elected to make things cheaper, whovowedto “end inflation and make America affordable again” on Day 1. Buton Wednesday—or Day 101 of the Trump presidency—he was busy blamingJoe Bidenfor the economy contracting in 2025’s first quarter and suggesting the second quarter will be his predecessor’s fault too. The public doesn’t appear to be buying Trump’s excuses, with a CNNpollfinding 6 in 10 Americans already saying his “policies have increased the cost of living in their community.” Trump has brushed off concerns about Americans having less and spending more. It was in a cabinet meeting last week where he first started talking about a reduction in toys,suggesting“children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls” and “maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.” Welkerasked himduring Sunday’s interview when it becomes the “Trump economy,” to which he responded, “It partially is right now. And I really mean this. I think the good parts are the Trump economy and the bad parts are the Biden economy, because he’s done a terrible job.” Meanwhile, Trump has embarked on a trade war, and was asked byTimeabout his adviserPeter Navarropromising “90 deals in 90 days,” none of which had yet been announced when the interview was published on April 25,or even now. “I’ve made 200 deals,” Trump claimed, though he didn’t provide any examples. And then there was the very scary prospect of a recession. Presidents tend to work very hard to prevent one—as even talk of a recession can rattle the markets. But bafflingly, Trump seemed open to the possibility. “Anything can happen,” Trump told Welker, while adding that he thinks “we’re going to have the greatest economic boom in history.” In a dizzying 100 days, Trump signed 142 executive orders, which is100 morethan Biden in the same period, and his administration is embroiled in legal battles over a number of them. One of the problematic fights Trump is waging at the moment is over due process, with potentially huge ramifications for American democracy. It’s a war Trump has been losing in the courts, including the Supreme Court, which ruled 9-0 that the United States must facilitate the return ofKilmar Abrego Garcia,a Maryland manlawlessly deportedto El Salvador. WhenaskedbyTimeif he had requested that El Salvador presidentNayib Bukeleturn over Abrego Garcia, Trump said, “I haven’t been asked to ask him by my attorneys. Nobody asked me to ask him that question, except you.” An odd answer from someone who has been repeatedly asked about the Abrego Garcia case. Meanwhile, Trump acknowledged inhis interviewwith ABC’sTerry Moranthat he could get Abrego Garcia back by making a call. When asked about the court’s order to facilitate his release, Trump said, “I’m not the one making this decision. We have lawyers that don’t want to do this.” The exchange, which included MorancorrectingTrump after he claimed Abrego Garcia had “MS-13” tattooed on his knuckles, grew increasingly tense, as the president started complaining that Moran was “not being very nice.” Days later, Welkerasked Trump, “Don’t you need to uphold the Constitution as president?” Trump responded, “I don’t know.” This answer is perhaps the scariest of all the answers Trump has given. Slightly more than 100 days ago, Trump swore on the Bible to “support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same.” So the question becomes: Does Trump no longer believe this to be true? Or did he never believe it? While Trump may act like he doesn’t care, and is the ultimate decider—“I run the country and the world,” hetoldThe Atlantic—these interviews suggest Trumpdoescare about shaping perceptions, or at least trying to explain himself. So he’s turning to the same media that he vilifies to spin his unpopularProject 2025 agendaand disastrous tariff rollout. Sure, he’s going to try and spin the mess of his first several months in office, but that doesn’t mean the public will buy it.

    "title": "What Does Trump’s Insane “100% Tariff” on “Foreign” Movies Even Mean?",
    "article_text": "More than 100 days into his presidency,Donald Trump’songoing trade waris coming to a theater near you. On Sunday, Trump announced his intention to put a 100% tariff on films produced outside of the United States, writing onTruth Socialthat the movie industry is dying a “very fast death” because of financial incentives offered by other countries to American productions. Trump said he is authorizing a tax on “any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands,” adding that any outsourcing beyond American soil “is a concerted effort by other Nations, and, therefore, a National Security threat.” He concluded: “WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!” Though Commerce SecretaryHoward Lutnickissued a quickreply on X—“We’re on it”—it was not immediately clear how such a tariff would be implemented, on which productions it could be enforced, or exactly what part of the moviemaking process would be taxed. “Can’t see his target here other than confusion and distraction,” a US distribution executive toldDeadline. Would American distributors be taxed when they acquire foreign titles, or only when American productions shoot overseas? Are streaming-only productions and TV series exempt from such a tax? Will upcomingsummer blockbusterslikeMission: Impossible—The Final ReckoningandJurassic World Rebirth,both filmed primarily in other countries, be somehow subject to retroactive taxes? Given the1988 Berman Amendment, which Trumpcitedin his first major tariff announcement in early April, can movies even legallybetaxed? And, likeTrump’s other sweeping tariffs on global goods, would levies make tickets to foreign films more expensive? Amid the flurry of uncertainties surrounding Trump’s plan,The Wall Street Journalreports that stocks in Netflix, Walt Disney, and Warner Bros. Discovery fell on Monday. Countries including Australia and New Zealand havevowedtheir continued support for American productions that film in those countries. And California governorGavin Newsom,who hasexpressed his interestin doubling his state’s offering of film and TV tax incentives, has had his staff speak out against the president. “We believe he has no authority to impose tariffs under theInternational Economic Emergency Powers Act, since tariffs are not listed as a remedy under that law,” Newsom senior adviser for communicationsBob SalladaytoldDeadlineon Sunday. It’s true that in recent years, fewer films have indeed been produced solely in the US. Hollywood has increasingly relied on work done in so-called “Foreign Lands” to combatrising labor costsand reap overseas tax credits. As theTimesreported, “According to the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, roughly 18,000 full-time American film industry jobshave been eliminatedin the past three years, primarily in California.” And the industry has yet to fully recover from thedual actors and writers strikesin 2023. Arecent report from FilmLAsays that shooting in LA decreased more than 22% for the three-month period from January to March 2025 compared to the first quarter of 2024, perThe Hollywood Reporter. But the film industry is also one of America’s most lucrative service-sector exports. According to the latesteconomic impact reportfrom the Motion Picture Association, which represents major studios, Hollywood “generated a positive U.S. balance of trade in every major market in the world.” (A rep for the organization declined to comment toVanity Fair.) Enhanced tax credits for US-based productions seem like a better way to incentivize local filming than putting penalties on productions that involve other countries. “He will kill the U.S. industry quicker as this will increase the cost of U.S. films that already weren’t selling well internationally,” a veteran French distributor toldDeadline. “Creating an incentive for shooting in the U.S. would have been smarter, but I’m not sure he has that much intelligence.” Even before his latest proclamation, Trump’s trade war with China haswreaked havoc on the film business. Just last month, China said it would“moderately reduce”the number of Hollywood films allowed into its theaters. Further tariffs would shrink “the entire global market,” someone from a leading US film company, who works on both domestic and international productions, recently toldDeadline. “We won’t be able to make movies for the same budgets, actors won’t get paid the same fees and the list goes on. Simply, it would destroy the independent sector.” Destruction is also a word on Trump’s lips. Speaking to reporters outside the White House on Sunday night, hesaidthat “other nations have been stealing the moviemaking capabilities from the United States.” Referring to “very strong research” he’d done over the past week, Trump claimed that “Hollywood is being destroyed.” Who is behind such invaluable research? The answer might just be Oscar-winning actorJon Voight,who has recently been spotted taking private meetings around Hollywood with various studios and guilds,Deadline reports. Voight “is the instigator of the president’s sudden interest in film production,” several sources toldThe Hollywood Reporter. At the start of his second term, TrumpappointedVoight, as well as his fellow Trump supportersSylvester StalloneandMel Gibson,as “special ambassadors to a great but very troubled place, Hollywood California.” The actors, Trumpwroteon Truth Social, “will serve as Special Envoys to me for the purpose of bringing Hollywood, which has lost much business over the last four years to Foreign Countries, BACK—BIGGER, BETTER, AND STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE!” In a statement provided toVanity Fairat the time, a representative for Gibson said that the actor found out about his appointment via Trump’s social media post. “I got the tweet at the same time as all of you and was just as surprised,” Gibson said in a statement. “Nevertheless, I heed the call. My duty as a citizen is to give any help and insight I can. Any chance the position comes with an ambassador’s residence?” It remains to be seen what role, if any, this trio will play in potential tariffs against international films.Vanity Fairhas reached out to reps for Gibson, Stallone, and Voight for comment. For now, the White House is playing the wait-and-see game regarding any tariff implementation. “Although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the Administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump’s directive to safeguard our country’s national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again,” White House spokesmanKush Desaisaid in a statement toThe Hollywood Reporteron Monday.

    "title": "Ahead of the Met Gala 2025, Costume Institute Raises Record $31 Million Before “Superfine” Exhibit Opens",
    "article_text": "At 9:30 a.m. sharp Monday,Max Hollein, the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, took a podium at the museum’s Charles Engelbert Court to commence with the press preview for “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” the show at the Costume Institute that forms the basis of thebig fundraising galathrown each year withVogueandAnna Wintour, the global chief content officer of Condé Nast. On paper, this was your typical museum press preview: the director gives opening remarks, and others follow. In this case, Costume Institute director and “Superfine” co-curatorAndrew Boltongave some context for the show, and then his co-curator, Barnard College professor and chair of Africana StudiesMonica Miller,gave some remarks about her approach to putting it all together. But of course this is kind of like the Super Bowl of art briefings, the only one where people get all dolled up for the honor of being the first people to lay eyes on an exhibition. And no doubt, everyone was extremely excited to get into the show. “Superfine” is the first Costume Institute show in two decades to focus on menswear, and it’s a rich and rewarding celebration of Black style, backed up by centuries of artworks and years of rigorous research. While the focus at the press preview is on the museum show, not the movie stars, there’s always a dollop of Hollywood glitz embedded within throngs of fashion editors.Colman Domingowas on hand to represent this year’s co-hosts, who includeLeBron James,A$AP Rocky,Sir Lewis Hamilton,Pharrell Williams, and Wintour. Kwame Onwuachi, Monica Miller, Andrew Bolton, Colman Domingo and Max Hollein attend the press conference for the 2025 Met Gala celebrating \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style\" at Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 05, 2025 in New York City. And after Hollein thankedVogue(andVanity Fair) corporate parent Condé Nast and its CEO,Roger Lynch,along with a smattering of other top donors for the evening—Instagram, LVMH,Tyler Perry,George LucasandMellody Hobson—he turned his attention to the events to come. He mentioned that in attendance in the crowd wasCy Gavin, the incredibly in-demand artist who painted the tent that houses the red carpet. Also in the house was chefKwame Onwuachi, who is set to cater the evening. In all honesty a big chunk of celebs in attendance tonight still can’t get a prime four-top res at his Lincoln Center restaurant, Tatiana. “As many of you know, there is a little party here tonight,” Hollein said, to chuckles from the crowd, before breaking a bit of news: theMet Galahad raised $31 million this year, an all-time record. Domingo gave some wonderful remarks about his style icons—his father, his step-father, and his brother—before the doors were open to the show. Now, I’ll need a few more spin-throughs before I could write a thorough review, but let’s just say for now, it has all the hallmarks of an out-and-out blockbuster. The artistTorkwase Dysonhas done a remarkable thing with the exhibition design, installing a series of sculptural platforms that are a clear extension of her artistic practice, to allow the space to nimbly display mannequins flanked by full looks on a higher vertical level than you’d see in most museum installs. “Superfine” takes as its core twelve sections that work through the last three centuries of Black history, seen through style. And each section presents work by contemporary designers, and then sticks them next to older garments that act as their counterpoint: take, for instance, a pair of new shoes designed byMartine Rose, and the striking resemblance they have to silk-leather shoes from the 1830s. This dynamic is enhanced by the selection of historical and contemporary art works that further the discussion of Black style and identity. It’s also a celebration of the historical figures that inform the idea of the Black dandy, a very incomplete list might include: Toussaint L'Ouverture, Frederick Douglass, Alexandre Dumas, Cab Calloway—do not miss the vitrine that displays “The New Cab Calloway’s Hepster’s Dictionary,” it is a revelation—Huey P. Newton, Miles Davis, André Leon Talley, and Virgil Abloh. Around 11 am most editors exited the Met onto a rain-slicked Fifth Avenue slightly dazed by the knockout of a show, many facing a quite eventful future 18 hours of writing and then partying and then writing again. And to my delight, the Met Gala’s power of celebrity was already oozing out of 81st Street. As I was leaving, I walked right byJeremy Allen White, airpods in and cap worn low, not noticed by anyone.

    "title": "Miley Cyrus Debuts New Song in Front of “a Couple of Exes” and Fashion’s Elite at Moncler’s Pre–Met Gala 2025 Party",
    "article_text": "A few weeks ago, Moncler sent out a cryptic save-the-date invitation that read, “Remo Ruffini&Edward Enninful,together withMiley Cyrus,invite you to Something Beautiful” at the hotel and members-only club Casa Cipriani on May 3—two nights beforethe Met Gala 2025, fashion’s biggest night. The date finally arrived, and guests were in for a special surprise, a live preview of Cyrus’s upcoming album, titled, ahem,Something Beautiful,out on May 30. Just after the sun set on New York’s warmest day in recent months, Moncler gathered more than 200 of the label’s closest friends and collaborators to celebrate at an intimate Met Gala pre-party on the fifth floor, inside under the dim lights, and outside on the covered—a blessing because of a flash thunderstorm—terrace. Edward Enninful In true host fashion, Enninful, the former stylist and BritishVogueeditor in chief, who has aMoncler Genius collectionhitting the market this fall, was one of the first to show up. “I have a newfound respect for designers because I’ve worked with every designer you can imagine on their fashion shows, but to be able to create something from my mind, [my] connection with Moncler, who I respect so much, and who are such pioneers in the field of collaboration and technology, was really a dream,” he said. ModelAdut Akech,who will be seated at the label’s table at Monday night’s Met Gala, stunned in a look from the Moncler x EE72 by Edward Enninful collection, consisting of a black full-length skirt and a puffer-coat backpack worn as an accessory. She had a fitting for her Met Gala look the day before that made her “feel like a princess boss lady,” before revealing that theMet Gala red carpetis more nerve-racking than any runway. “I’m really, really anxious, and then once I go on the carpet, the rest is just a blur,” she said. Once the party started, guests includingColin Kaepernick, Ozwald Boateng, Anne Hathaway, LaKeith Stanfield, Fei Fei Sun,Baz Luhrmann,Daniel Kaluuya,andHeidi Klum,who arrived withGuram Gvasaliaof Vetements, filled the space as servers passed trays of Champagne and the famed carpaccio and grilled ham and cheese sandwiches from the original Cipriani in Venice, Harry’s Bar. Around 10:30 p.m., partygoers flooded into the Jazz Café for Something Beautiful, Cyrus’s first live performance of her new ballad “More to Lose,” accompanied only by a piano. “I have a lot of people that I’ve known and loved for a very long time in this room, even a couple of exes…and this song is about something like that,” revealed the artist, who called her newest album,Something Beautiful,her “love letter to music and to fashion.” Underscoring that connection, on June 6, a week after the album’s debut, an accompanying film featuring archival looks by Thierry Mugler, Jean Paul Gaultier, and Bob Mackie will be released. Cyrus, the first to wear a full ensemble from the Moncler x EE72 by Edward Enninful collection—a ribbed black halter and skinny pants—followed with her hit song “Flowers” as the crowd sang along. She wished the crowd an incredible Met Gala before saying, “We’re in a week that is focused on outer and exterior beauty and relevance. As much as I love it, and I will be looking sickening, my heart is going to be sickening, too, because I’m there with good intention. And everyone that’s ever been a part of my life, or everyone that I’ve ever loved—and there is one that is in this room—I just want to say, I appreciate you deeply for everything that you’ve ever meant to me.” Themes of Black elegance and fashion as liberation coursed through the evening, echoingthe 2025 Met Gala theme, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” a celebration of Black dandyism. Earlier in the evening, while talking over espresso martinis and pasta,Evan RossandWillow Smith,the latter in a knit asymmetrical Moncler dress, shared their excitement about the celebration of Black style. “I was thinking about Little Richard back in the day and all those kinds of things that I used to love watching,” said Ross. “And Sammy Davis, there’s a lot of elegance that I think we should bring back anyway.” Smith added, “Visionary African American culture has always propelled the culture forward, and we need more of that.” “It’s a monumental theme, and I think it’s absolutely incredible how they’re doing it,” said rapper and actorTobe Nwigwe. After the performance, a new wave of guests came from an uptown pre-party forGrace Wales Bonnerat The Guggenheim. “I’m most excited about seeing people who fail spectacularly at living up to what they think Tailored for You [the Met Gala’s dress code] in the style of a Black dandy means,” said playwrightJeremy O. Harris,one of the Met Gala hosts. Channeling the spirit of the 19th-century Black dandy, he explained that the exhibition’s guest curator,Monica Miller,told him the greatest dandies always knew how to make an outfit from one accessory, and he previewed a special accessory he plans to wear to the event, inspired by those early style icons—something “no Black man had back then, and now I have one.” Tessa Thompson and Edward Enninful ActorTessa Thompsonwas wearing high heels to practice for her fifth Met Gala red carpet. “I grew up looking at photographs of my grandfather, my grandmother, and their finest, and the way they would look when they traveled by train,” she recalled. “It feels like this is almost an homage to them. And I’m really excited to see how people play homage to all the fabulous folks that have come before us.” DirectorJanicza Bravoapproached us, hinting at her outfit. “I’m going withTory Burch.It’s a collaboration between her andRashid Johnson,and that’s all I’ll say,” she revealed, saying that the theme is “fucking sick and long overdue.” As partygoers hit the dance floor, actorJodie Turner-Smithjoked, “I am going to the Met Gala with my husband—Daniel Lee,” as Lee, the chief creative officer at Burberry who designed her Monday night ensemble, walked by. “Hi!” he smiled. “I love how Black it is, honey,” she declared about the Met Gala theme. “I can’t wait to see the creativity, because one thing about us—we are creative.” Dylan Mulvaney and Laverne Cox ActorLaverne Cox,at the stroke of midnight, went intellectual on Black dandyism with a history lesson she picked up from reading exhibition curator Miller’s 2009 book,Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity.She explained how the exhibition is an intersection of “queer theory and queer history, fashion history and Black history…. Europeans dressed us up, and we were kind of like these accessories, but in emancipation, as we started to dress ourselves, it became liberatory, and that is really one of the most beautiful things in the world for me as a trans person, as a Black person that thinks they have been oppressive: We can take them, resignify them, remix them, and they can become liberatory.” Live UpdatesFrom the 2025 Met Gala See All the Fashion, Outfits, and Looks on theMet Gala Red Carpet Plus, Who MadeVF’sBest-Dressed List?

    "title": "Mia Threapleton Grew Up as Kate Winslet’s Daughter. Now She’s Wes Anderson’s Breakout Star",
    "article_text": "A few months ago,Mia Threapletongot an email fromWes Anderson.The director told her that the movie they’d shot last year,The Phoenician Scheme, was finished, and asked when she’d be available to watch it. “My movie theater etiquette brain kicked in. I thought, Okay, well, if there are other people in there, I can’t bring a loud snack, so what am I going to do?” Threapleton tellsVanity Fair.“I know: I’ll buy two huge tomatoes from the grocers around the corner.” She brought the fresh produce to the theater before realizing she’d be watching the movie alone. “The minute the opening credits started rolling, I burst into tears while about to take a bite out of a tomato,” she says. Threapleton cried intermittently through the rest. She felt startled by her prominence on the big screen: “Oh my God, there’s my face. That’s a lot of my face.” Afterwards, she sent Anderson a voice note telling him how much she loved the film, and relayed the whole tomato story. He told her he was happy she enjoyed the movie—and added, “I wish someone had told you that we were going to be on your own. You could have had a louder snack.” All of this, in fairness, is new to Threapleton. The 24-year-old English actor has appeared in a handful of films and TV series, including a small part in theJude Lawperiod dramaFirebrandand a main role on Apple TV+’sThe Buccaneers.But a lead role in an Anderson film—stuffed, as always, with A-listers and his most beloved recurring collaborators—is beyond uncharted territory. Premiering later this month at the Cannes Film Festival, the movie marks the moment Threapleton will be discovered by a larger public, to say nothing of the industry itself; despite being a newcomer to this singular filmmaker’s world, she’s a thrillingly natural fit. It’s also the moment more people are bound to learn about Threapleton’s background—specifically, that she isKate Winslet’s daughter. Threapleton has no interest in hiding this fact. She recently acted opposite her Oscar-winning mother in a devastating installment of Channel 4’sI Am…series, for which Winslet won a BAFTA, and speaks to me about her upbringing—and decision to follow in Winslet’s footsteps—with a breezy ease. “She was incredibly supportive of my desire to want to do this on my own because that’s how she did it. She did it on her own,” Threapleton says. “Now I get to talk to her about cool work stories that I have experienced myself, which is lovely. I’ll go, ‘Oh, yeah, then the camera does that weird thing. Have you had that as well?’ She’s like, ‘Oh, yeah! I know about that! God, that’s so funny when that happens.’” As to the blinding spotlight, and ensuing scrutiny, that will come with walking the red carpet at Cannes for the first time? Threapleton demurs: “I mean, people are going to find out.” Anderson watched hundreds of quick audition tapes while casting the role of Sister Liesl inThe Phoenician Scheme. Threapleton’s reading stood out. “She was clearly really thinking about every moment. She just seemed completely authentic,” the filmmaker tells me. “When you see the same scene played again and again and again by people who maybe aren’t right for the part anyway, to have somebody who seems like she’s in a documentary and she’s interesting—this stops everything.” Anderson asked to meet her in person in London. “I went and met Wes, and instantly wasn’t nervous about him at all because he was wearing pink socks and hotel slippers with glasses,” Threapleton says. “We just talked for a really long time. We both had this moment of going, ‘We should probably do some acting right?’” She didn’t start to get familiar with the script until later, and it was treated as top secret; she could only access an encrypted file in tight time windows before the screen test that followed. When she got word of her official casting, she was surrounded by strangers on a train. “I burst into tears and hid in a bike locker on the train, and just sat down and cried and called everybody I could think of to call,” she says. When we meet Sister Liesl, she’s headstrong, quick-witted, and emotionally removed from her father, Zsa-zsa Korda (Benicio del Toro)—a wealthy businessman with a long list of enemies. They haven’t seen each other in six years when he seeks her out, after surviving yet another attempt on his life. (His sixth plane crash, to be exact.) He presents her with an elaborate plan to secure her future by appointing her the successor of a dicey land-expansion project that’s been decades in the making. The two of them and his mild-mannered, heavily accented Norwegian tutor Bjorn (Michael Cera) embark on a dangerous yet whimsical mission to see it through, peppered along the way with such stars asBryan Cranston, Tom Hanks, Jeffrey Wright, Scarlett Johansson,andBenedict Cumberbatch. Here, Anderson movingly revisits the kind of troubled father-daughter dynamic he explored inThe Royal Tenenbaums,within the structure of a fast-paced caper that’s at times giddily reminiscent ofThe Grand Budapest Hotel. The plot’s high-risk hijinx paves a path for a resonant family tale. “There is a gulf between them, but the movie is the story of them negotiating their way across this gulf and making a deal to be a family,” Anderson says. In the role, Threapleton pulls off a distinctive, almost deadpan heartbreak. “Liesl seemed like an onion. There were small half layers, and then there were big whole layers,” the actor says. “Then you get to the middle, and there’s just always more and more stuff…more layers to run around.” With production set up in Germany, Threapleton experienced Anderson’s full “summer camp” approach to filmmaking. Everyone stayed in the same hotel. The ground floor featured AV offices and the costumes department, with hair and makeup down the hall; breakfast and dinner was “in the middle bit,” with individual rooms on the other side. When it got warm, Threapleton went swimming with the crew in the lake nearby. She got asked out to lunch by Cranston one day, and had to remind herself, “Okay, it’s not Walter White. That’s Bryan Cranston. That’s your coworker, Mia.” Those pinch-me moments happened pretty regularly. “I remember this moment where I had Tom Hanks on my left, Bryan Cranston on my right, Riz Ahmed diagonally, Benicio in front of me, Wes at one end, and Michael to the other side,” Threapleton says. “Tom was telling a story about an experience that he’d had filmingSaving Private Ryan. I just sat there and I put my hands under my legs. I’m thinking, It’s bloodyWoody. Get out! What am I doing here? This is ridiculous.” Threapleton has been an Anderson fan since she sawFantastic Mr. Foxwhen she was nine years old, and points toMoonrise Kingdomas a personal favorite. Given the director’s exacting nature, she wondered what it would be like to work with him. She, Cera, and Del Toro rehearsed for about a week before cameras started rolling, and they found an instant rhythm. (Of the trio, only Del Toro had worked with Anderson before, inThe French Dispatch.) “This is probably going to sound a little bit strange…but [Wes] loves naturalism,” Threapleton says. “He’s so clear about what it is that he wants…. But the amount of creative freedom that everybody has while working with him is brilliant.” By the first official day of filming, she felt fully—almost disarmingly—in sync with his worldview. “One day pretty early on in the shoot, we were in the kitchen, and Wes came in and just quickly moved something and then went back,” Threapleton recalls. “We all sort of looked at it and went, ‘Oh yeah, that should always have been like that. That makes complete sense.’” She’d ask about making physical adjustments: an eye movement, an eyebrow lift, “are my shoulders up or down more?” She likens filming a given scene inThe Phoenician Schemeto being a part of a “tableau”: “It’s happening right in front of you, and there aren’t that many cuts…. You are living in it every single day.” Mia Threapleton and Kate Winslet accepting the single-drama award for “I Am Ruth” during the 2023 BAFTA Television Awards. Threapleton first went to Germany for a film shoot when she was seven years old—though not for her own film, of course. The family spent some time there while Winslet shotThe Reader,the Holocaust drama that won her a best-actress Oscar. “We didn’t know anything about it at all,” Threapleton says. This was generally how things worked growing up. She did not have a sense of her mother’s decorated career. Hollywood was kept as far away from her as it seemed on the map. “[An actor] taking their kid to a film set seems like the equivalent of a lawyer taking their child into a courtroom,” Threapleton says. Around 10 years old, she got her first sense of Winslet’s notoriety. The star was asked to do a reading at a literary festival; Threapleton was in the crowd, surrounded by adoring fans. “I propped myself up on my knees and looked around, and there weresomany people,” Threapleton says. “I ran over to her at the end, and I said, ‘Oh my God, mum. Loads of people came. Loads of people know who you are!’ She said, ‘Yeah, they kind of do.’” But Threapleton says she wasn’t used to seeing scripts around the house or feel fame encroaching on the family’s private life. Every part of Winslet’s career was contained in the star’s small home office, which Threapleton never dared enter because “there were usually birthday presents that were hidden under the desk.” “I’ve never had social media. I don’t want it. It’s not something that I think would really serve my life very much,” Threapleton continues. “I never really read magazines either. So I was just never that aware of theknownnessof her until I got a little bit later in my teenage years.” Her childhood dream of being a marine biologist was dashed when she realized “I can’t do math, and I’m rubbish at science.” She was about 13 when she first said out loud that she wanted to be an actor; her mom was the first person she told. “She said, ‘Amazing, okay, I’m so excited for you,’ and I won’t ever forget what she said next,” Threapleton says, before an uncanny Winslet starts coming through in her voice. “She said, ‘It’s really hard work, darling. It’sreallyhard work—but that’s why I love it.’” She treated this like a mantra. Threapleton went out on her own, looking for agents and seeking out open auditions on casting websites. She’s now beaten her mother to the distinction of starring in a Wes Anderson movie. On her days off from shooting, Threapleton hung around thePhoenicianset. She’d sneak into a corner to watch the action without disrupting it. “I ended up hiding under a table with a tablecloth and watching from behind the camera while laying on my stomach,” she says. “Honestly, I felt like a kid.” That feeling still comes up occasionally. When she first got the job, she assumed she was in a dream and waited for someone to wake her up. Now, a few weeks out from the premiere, she’s back in that state. “I know that it’s happening now, and people are going to see it, but I really can’t believe that I was a part of it. I really can’t,” she says. “I am never going to forget any of it. None of it at all. I’m going to keep it close to my heart. I feel like I’m still dreaming.” This story is part ofAwards Insider’s in-depthCannes coverage, including first looks and exclusive interviews with some of the event’s biggest names.

    "title": "Go With God: Danny McBride, Edi Patterson, and More Bid Farewell to ‘The Righteous Gemstones’",
    "article_text": "If you know a fan ofThe Righteous Gemstones,say a prayer for them. After four sinful seasons, the show came to an end May 4 on HBO. For longtime viewers, bidding adieu to its cast of stunted but heartfelt televangelists is, to quote Judy Gemstone, “like, horror movie shit, dude!” A true black comedy,Gemstonesturns its lens toward a mega-rich cast of characters who are simultaneously larger than life and achingly real: Eli Gemstone (John Goodman), pastor and family patriarch; his often petulant adult children Jesse (Danny McBride), Judy (Edi Patterson), and Kelvin (Adam DeVine); and their respective spouses, partners, and families. It joins the legacy ofVice PrincipalsandEastbound & Downbefore it—shows produced by McBride,Jody Hill,andDavid Gordon Greenabout fundamentally flawed but lovable characters. It’s hard to adequately put into words just how sprawling the Gemstones’ evangelical world is. Over four seasons, viewers have been treated to everything from heart-pounding car chases and secret societies to a swarm of locusts, an abundance of full-frontal male nudity, mini-mall churches being erected—and burned to the ground—and a genuinely tear-jerking storyline involving a freak pole-dancing accident and a service monkey. Cast and crew from the show talked toVanity Fairto celebrate their time spent “misbehavin’” on set and saying goodbye to life on the Gemstone compound. As McBride puts it, “All good things have to come to an end.” McBride has a talent for creating characters that are ostensibly outrageous—problematic, grating, even maniacal—without ever turning them into caricatures. “Gemstonesis really Danny’s baby,” says Hill about his longtime collaborator. It’s a show imbued with a profound humanity; a pain, a hardship, a relatability. And that’s by design. “Making people invested is the point, you know?” says McBride. “Making them see themselves in someone who, from the outside, they would never assume they would see any traits of themselves in. It’s not about trying to create sympathy for those kinds of people—it’s about making something interesting.” “You have to ground their circumstances in the real world,” saysWalton Goggins,who plays Eli Gemstone’s brother-in-law Baby Billy. “Make no mistake about it, Baby Billy is a narcissist…albeit a lovable one. He was funny, yes, but as with all comedy for me, it was underlined with great pain.” It’s also, always, about getting the laugh. “Danny and the creative team at Rough House [Pictures] are able to walk that line between silly and absurd while keeping the characters grounded,” says DeVine. “Danny would agree—this is a comedy first, and the goal is to make people laugh and forget their problems for a little bit.” The dynamic on set was one of both collaboration and trust. Emmy Award–nominated costume designerChristina Flannerysays she rarely got notes on her work, which isas vivid and singularas the show’s writing. “Sometimes I put my foot in my mouth, like with Teen Demon,” she says of costuming the devil in Baby Billy’s latest endeavor: a television show about Jesus as a teen, calledTeenjus.“I found this incredible costume, and it included these stilts. And [the writers] were like, ‘Oh, we have to have the stilts.’ My crew was like, ‘Can you just shut the fuck up, Christina?’” she laughs. “But it obviously turned out great.” On another occasion, Hill came up with an Easter egg for Flannery to nestle into her costume design: He suggested that when the Gemstone kids travel by boat to retrieve their missing father, they wear outfits inspired by the Sea Org uniforms worn by Scientologists. The show doesn’t aim to ignore the obvious political implications of evangelicalism, nor does it obscure the corruptionsometimes foundin the world of megachurches. But it also doesn’t want to mock or alienate anyone who might see themselves or someone they love in that world. In season two, we learn that Aunt Tiff (Valyn Hall), Baby Billy’s wife, can’t read. “I know people like Aunt Tiff. I have family from the hills. They’re people, and they deserve respect,” says Hall. “And I remember [that conversation] on set, someone saying, ‘I don’t like that they’re making fun of her.’ I said, ‘Do you know what the literacy rate is in America?’ A lot of people have difficulty reading in this country. We’re not making fun of her. It’s part of her reality and it’s part of her humanity. It’s not that she can’t learn—it’s that she hasn’t learned.” By humanizing its characters,The Righteous Gemstonesmakes itself a conduit for understanding. “I think it cuts so close to the bone and it is so relatable because it is based in truth,” saysCassidy Freeman,who plays Jesse’s wife, Amber. “And to me, that’s progressive. Not because the show believes in one thing or another—but because it brings everybody to the table. I mean, no show with this much old dick should have you on the verge of tears every episode. We’re literally laughing at humanity. And God bless it, because how else are we going to get through it?” It would be easy for a show about televangelists to marginalize its female characters—making them the butt of jokes, relegated to positions devoid of both power and complexity. But for four seasons,The Righteous Gemstones’ unmistakable superpower has been the way it positions its female characters. Edi Patterson has been in the writers room since season one, and she speaks at length about balancing vulgarity with heart. “I find blue things really funny, but I only find ’em funny if they’re smart. I’m not a fan of nasty just for nasty’s sake—that may shock people,” she laughs. “It’s got to have specificity and meaning and uniqueness.” That attention to detail helps Judy’s crass one-liners about leaving “snail trails” on her chair and “finger dancin’ on [her] snap drags” outrank even her brother’s raunchiest jokes. “She makes me laugh to the point where I mess up takes. She says stuff that catches me off guard, and she’sdirty,” says Hill, laughing even now. “She makes you blush.” In molding Judy, Patterson never lost sight of her character’s deep pain—her pent-up anger about the loss of her mother, how she never felt seen by her family. Judy is always teetering on the edge of seething horniness and suffocating bitterness. “I love her, and I love how wild she is,” says Patterson. “And I don’t have any disdain for her, like zero fucking percent. I just root for her.” Whether we want to admit it or not, there’s at least a little bit of Judy in all of us. “We all have a full wild animal inside,” she says. “Who’s gonna see her and say, ‘Not me!’? Fuck off.” Judy’s counterpart is Amber Gemstone—endlessly measured and patient, particularly toward her buffoonish husband. “I knew that Amber was going to seem, to me as a modern woman, to be in a bit of an antiquated relationship,” says Freeman. “But at the same time, I understood her.” From literally shooting her husband in the rear to offering marital advice to Judy and BJ, Amber is always at the ready with a solution—something she’s able to do because of her keen ability to choose her battles. “She’s a gentle warrior,” says Freeman. “She reminds me of my mother if she had actually accepted the church. She was raised very Christian, and she really did not like [the misogyny]. She did not like the way the church treated gay people, or Black people. She was a Freedom Rider. But I see parts of Amber in my mom in that no matter what, she would go and cheer someone on.” At times, the relationships between the show’s female characters are fraught; other times, they’re tender. “There are just certain things that happen in a woman’s life, whether we’ve been pregnant or not, whether we have children or not—there is just something about our energy where we’re just innately better at giving. Innately better at stretching,” Freeman says. “And we show up for each other.” In a world where all too often women are still the punch line,Gemstonesproves a refreshing respite. “I’ve never been someone who thinks comedy exists for one sex; it’s not something I can even get my head around,” says McBride, whose own sisters and daughter helped inspire Judy. “My mom is funny as fuck. When I was a kid, she and my sisters would prank call people all the time. I have two sisters who can relentlessly break my balls. It’s not even something we’re trying to do—it’s just how I see the world.” In many ways, the show follows five very different love stories: Jesse and Amber, Judy and BJ (Tim Baltz), Kelvin and Keefe (Tony Cavalero), Baby Billy and Aunt Tiff, and, of course, Eli and Aimee-Leigh (Jennifer Nettles). Navigating his character—a new widower—was initially fraught for Goodman. “Eli was still grieving his wife, he had all these screwy kids,” he says. “I just pictured him as shut-down. And it was hard, because everyone else was having fun—of course I was having fun between takes—but I was playing the straight man.” By season four, life found Eli retired, moving on in his love life and, with some success, gaining some independence from his kids. “He’s a deserving guy,” says Goodman. And while we only see Aimee-Leigh in flashbacks, her lingering presence motivates many of the show’s characters. “It was his great love story,” says Goodman. “And they never really spell it out, but I’m pretty sure she was his spiritual awakening.” For most of the Gemstone kids, their partners are redeemers—and their tethers to reality. “Danny told me early on, ‘BJ is the eyes of the audience,’” says Baltz. Despite BJ’s gentle and wholesome demeanor, he never begrudges Judy for being herself; on the contrary, he embraces it. “He is someone with unconditional love for his wife, written in a way I have never seen before,” says Baltz. “One of my favorite lines is at the end of season two, when he says to Judy, ‘I’d love nothing more than to bang your played-out-mother pussy for the rest of my days.’ It’s such a crass thing to say, especially to a woman, but it’s so indicative of their relationship.” Even the most unlikely of couples—the elderly Baby Billy and the much (much) younger Aunt Tiff—have beaten the odds. “Aunt Tiff and Baby Billy’s love is so pure,” says Goggins. “One of the best parts of this experience was getting to shape this relationship with Valyn. Their dynamic is so funny and full of heart…. They are soulmates.” Hall agrees. To prepare for the role, she imagined what Tiff would do if Baby Billy died. “I came to the conclusion that she would hide the body so they wouldn’t have to do a funeral—because as long as he’s not buried, he’s not dead. That’s when I realized she’s not a gold digger.” Arguably one of the most unique love stories on television is that of youth pastor turned LGBTQ+ church leader Kelvin Gemstone and Keefe, the reformed Satanist he rescued from a life of sin. Of all his time on set, the loved-up scenes between his character and Kelvin were Cavalero’s favorite. “What’s so beautiful about their relationship is this deep admiration, even as they’re still sorting it out,” the actor says. By the time season three rolled around, their will-they-won’t-they plot had reached a fever pitch. “I told [Danny], ‘I’d really love for them to kiss.’ Sure enough, two weeks later, Jody came up to me and was like, ‘Did Danny talk to you about the whole kiss thing? He wants you to fully go for one,’” says Cavalero. “And [after] that take the whole crew was cheering and clapping. People were celebrating.” For a show that celebrated love in all its forms—for better and worse—it’s fitting that the final season closes with Kelvin and Keefe’s wedding. And it’s hard to deny the statement thatGemstones,a show about evangelism, is making by letting a gay wedding have the final word—an event that’s fully accepted, embraced, and celebrated by the entire Gemstone family. When McBride began writing season four, he knew it was probably going to be the end ofThe Righteous Gemstones.But that was a hard reality to face. “I didn’t want to even admit it to myself,” he says. “It’s really difficult to create something like this and to then be the person who’s pulling the plug on it, you know?” But he also didn’t want the show to overstay its welcome—and Hill agreed: “I love the idea of ending a show before it gets stale.” Still, they didn’t tell the cast until days before shooting wrapped. “[Sometimes in final seasons], you can kind of see an actor saying goodbye to their character, and it can seem cringey sometimes,” says McBride. “I think the true way to end it is like, you give them an ending, but then what happens to those characters? That’s up to the audience at that point. “WithGemstones,I want it to feel like a breathing, living world,” he adds. “I want you to take those characters with you and kind of in your brain imagine what they do next.” But those who can’t accept that should know that Patterson and Baltz agree hands down that Judy and BJ are endgame. McBride and Freeman feel much the same about Jesse and Amber, as do Goggins and Hall about Billy and Tiff. And while DeVine says it might be interesting to see how Kelvin explores life as a single man one day, Cavalero is resolute that he and Keefe will go all the way as well. It’s not just the show that cast and crew had to part with. McBride famously shoots his projects on his home turf in South Carolina, which everyone agrees he made feel like home—whether it was inviting everyone over to watchGame of Throneson Sunday nights or taking cast, crew, and their families out on a boat day or to a ball game. Some cast members even bought property nearby, so they’d have a base in South Carolina too. It’s clear that for all of them, this was more than just another job. “I remember looking around and thinking, The sum here is greater than the parts—and the parts are pretty fucking awesome,” says Baltz. It’s a standard McBride set, says DeVine. “After seeing how Danny holds himself and how he leads his cast and crew, I was like, oh, this is exactly how it’s done.” When asked what he will miss most about theGemstonesworld, Goodman’s answer was simple: “Just being with everybody. Hanging out, goofing around. There were no jerks on set,” he says with a laugh. “I don’t expect to do anything like it ever again. It was so unique.” Live UpdatesFrom the 2025 Met Gala See All the Fashion, Outfits, and Looks on theMet Gala Red Carpet Plus, Who MadeVF’sBest-Dressed List?

    "title": "Prabal Gurung Recalls His First Met Gala, When Zoe Saldaña Was at His Side",
    "article_text": "On the morning of April 26, 2010, I awoke to a buzzing phone. The stream of texts pouring in read, “OMG! CONGRATULATIONS! YOU DID IT!” I clicked the link a friend sent and slowly saw the First Lady’s face appear and as the rest of her image downloaded, I caught a glimpse of the “Prabal red” at her neckline, and then my dress filled the screen.Michelle Obamawas walking into theWhite House Correspondents’ Dinner, holding President Obama’s hand, wearing my dress. I was blinking back tears as I thought, “Of all the racks of clothes to choose from, she selected this dress, which I had, once again, specifically draped to resemble my mother’s sari.” Michelle was the epitome of style and substance, and she was married to a man who was beginning to redefine patriarchy. His slogan during his presidential campaign about the audacity of hope epitomized why I wanted to come to America. And the Obama White House was so much closer to my own idea of what it meant to be American than anything I’d ever seen. By choosing this dress, she was choosing me. That same day, I got an email from someone atVogueinviting me to the Met Gala pre-­party cocktail hour. Going to theMet Galawas another item on my vision board. The event started in 1948 as a fundraiser for theCostume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Artand has since grown to become one of the most famous and glamorous fundraisers in the world— thanks to Anna Wintour, who has been the host since the midnineties. It always takes place on the first Monday in May, andVoguecontrols the coveted guest list. Every year there’s a theme, and in 2010, it was “American Woman: Fashioning a National Identity.” JoiningAnna Wintouras cohosts that year were Patrick Robinson and Oprah Winfrey. What most people don’t know is that there are several tiers of invitations to the Met Gala. This invitation was exclusively for the pre-­party cocktail hour. It meant I could walk the red carpet, but I couldn’t attend the dinner and after-­party. Hilary Rhoda’s stylist had selected a black-­and-red minidress from my third collection for the young model to wear, so this invitation meant that I could walk Hilary up the famed red carpet to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This was the next step in realizing my dream: not only to get invited to the dinner but also to host my own table. And I had been manifesting it since my time at Bill Blass, where I had always advocated that the brand should be represented at the Met Gala, but Michael loathed the idea. After he left, I reached out to Lauren Santo Domingo, who was hosting the after-­party that year, and asked if I could bring Zoe Saldana to that as my date. ‘Walk Like a Girl: A Memoir’ by Prabal Gurung Amazon Bookshop Zoe and I had become close by then—she had done only two small films, but I knew in my gut that she was going to be a superstar. She was a wildly elegant, gorgeous, and funny Dominican girl from the Bronx who was determined to make it in Hollywood, where there were so few Latinx roles. From the moment I met her, I adored her. She reminded me of myself. Lauren said yes, and I dressed Zoe in a beautiful Bill Blass ball gown and myself in a tuxedo. We had dinner at a chic restaurant—a Dominican girl and a Nepali boy—on the Upper East Side, where we stood out among the crowd of Upper East Siders. There, everyone commented, “You look so beautiful! Where are you going?” “The Met Gala,” we said, smiling. It was all very magical. That evening, over dinner, we talked about our dreams—and heartaches. She was filmingStar Trekand had been cast in Avatar, but neither had come out yet. I told her I wanted to leave Bill Blass and launch my own namesake line one day. That was the night we made our pact: I would dress her for her first red carpet appearance, and she would come to my first show. And then we headed to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for the after-­party, where I saw all the usual suspects—socialites, editors, models, celebrities—whom I always ran into at all the galas. Some of them had become good friends over the years and some remained acquaintances. All polite, nice, sweet, but once again, every person except for Zoe, the actress Joy Bryant, very few others, and me were white. I wasn’t disheartened or dejected. Though I do remember coming back home that night and thinking to myself, “Is this ever going to change? Is white America the only America to be represented in this haute couture high fashion space?” Being invited to any portion of the Met Gala gives you access to the most exclusive curation of creative people—designers, movie stars, artists, and musicians. I was still in the early stages of building my brand, so having a moment on the red carpet with Hilary Rhoda wearing my black, white, and red sculpted minidress that was a hybrid of old-­school couture meets the new modern world was huge. In a sea filled with gowns and trains, she looked young and hip and totally glamorous. When we arrived at the Met that evening, I took a deep breath. The stairs leading up to the museum were lined with photographers. I took Hilary’s arm and we began to ascend, surrounded by the sounds of clicking cameras and different names being shouted interlaced with the syncopated pops of flashes. I focused on each step, one foot in front of the other, thinking how far I had come from playing with paper dolls to sketching in notebooks to getting on that plane to Parsons . . . and now making my way toward the pinnacle of the fashion world. I was halfway up the stairs when I heard a photographer shout, “Prabal!” I was shocked, as I did not expect anyone to know who I was. And yet, as I turned and posed, it also felt totally natural, like I was meant to be there. Once inside the museum, I began weaving through the glamorous crowd and recognized so many faces, from Taylor Swift to Sarah Jessica Parker. I was mesmerized, just soaking it all in when I heard someone else shout my name: “Prabal!” This time, it was Oprah Winfrey, standing with Anna Wintour. I walked over to her to say hello. “He was in my closet a couple of weeks ago,” Oprah said with a big smile. “And Michelle! She looked amazing! Congratulations, you must be so thrilled.” I was! Particularly because she was saying all of this in front of Anna. “I’m so proud of you, Prabal!” Oprah added. “You’re doing it! You’re really doing it!” And then she gave me a tight hug. It was the most generous and loving moment. We chatted a bit more, and then I started to wander through the crowd—saying hello to the people I knew, including magazine editors and a few famous designers. I felt like Cinderella at the ball, caught up in the magic of it all. When people started to move toward the dining room, I realized that the clock had struck midnight for my fairy-­tale story. As much as I wished that I could follow everyone in, my invitation limited me to the cocktail party, not the dinner. I did not want to face the red carpet again. People were still arriving, and I thought it would be best to slip out unnoticed. I pulled a waiter aside and asked discreetly, “Is there a back exit?” He looked at me, confused, and I explained. “I’m not going to the dinner.” He nodded and said, “Follow me.” I did, and as he pushed open a back door he said, “It’s going to happen for you.” I was so touched by his vote of confidence, this total stranger. His kind words felt like the hug I needed at that moment. I thanked him, and as I walked into the spring evening air, I could hear the paparazzi behind me. I turned to see the red carpet, the cameras snapping, the stars still arriving, fashionably late. In 2013 I was invited to attend the Met Gala—both cocktailsanddinner. And in 2018 I was invited to dress an entire table when Tasaki bought a table. The theme was “Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination.” I wasn’t just getting a seat at the table—I was getting the opportunity to create the table that I always wanted to sit at: colorful in every form. I invited and dressed supermodel Ashley Graham; Bollywood star Deepika Padukone; actors Diane Kruger, Gabrielle Union, and Eiza González; pop star Hailee Steinfeld; Japanese supermodel Hikari Mori; and Chinese supermodel Ming Xi. It was emotional and humbling to see my dream—that couture is stronger in color—come to life. That was a night I will never forget. I thought back to taking Zoe to that Met Gala after-­party years earlier, where we were two of only a handful of brown people at the entire party. And here I was, hosting my own table of dynamic, strong, smart, and diverse women. In 2021, I received an email from Andrew Bolton, the chief curator of the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, saying that he wanted to include the opening look from my tenth-­anniversary show, “Who Gets to Be American?,” for the Met Gala’s exhibitionIn America: A Lexicon of Fashion. It was a white cotton dress with asymmetrical sleeves, a side cutout with intricately placed handmade buttons, and a draped skirt under which a bouquet of flowers was lodged. It was my nod at all things American: cotton and its deeply problematic past in America, a bouquet of flowers and sash that represented the pomp and pageantry of beauty competitions—a staple of American culture— married with a graceful sensuality of a sari and blouse from the East. Worn on the runway by Chinese model Lina Zhang, it was a collision of cultures, continents, beauty standards, and questions: Who gets to be American? To whom does America belong? I was beyond moved by the recognition. And then Vogue published an article called “Made in the USA: A Glimpse Behind the Curtain at ‘In America: A Lexicon of Fashion,’” in which the opening paragraph talks about my work. Andrew Bolton was quoted: “The most ambitious exhibition to date from the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute kick-­starts with a question: Who gets to be American? A red, white, and blue silk sash from the grand finale of Prabal Gurung’s 2020 10th-­anniversary collection bears the phrase, and it greets visitors from the threshold of the Anna Wintour Costume Center. It’s a query every immigrant must consider—but shrouded in golden light at the outset of a fashion retrospective, it takes on a new verve. ‘It was important to open with that,’ says Andrew Bolton, the Costume Institute’s Wendy Yu Curator in Charge. ‘It tackles this notion of acceptance and belonging, which recent events have brought to the fore. Of course, these are questions that have always been present—but there are moments in history when they’re more resonant and resounding.’” My dress would greet visitors from the entrance of the Anna Wintour Costume Center at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It had a red, white, and blue silk sash featuring the phrase “Who Gets to Be American?” I was so moved that a piece from my tenth-­anniversary collection—a deeply personal collection that had been deemed by some as too political or too “on the nose” (according to one critic)—had been responsible for inspiring the 2021 Met Gala exhibition. I was grateful to Andrew, Anna, and everyone at the Met—for seeing me, and all the people I designed for. Unlike the investor who saw, in my non- whiteness, someone who could never be truly American, the Met curators saw us as an important part of the American past, present, and future. It felt as though we had powerful allies who saw and celebrated us for who we were. The Met Gala was two weeks later, and my table was an example of everything I’d been fighting for all these years as my guests represented everything I believed in: dynamic, powerful, influential women who were unapologetically original and unabashedly graceful. I was grateful to Anna for inviting me to host and dress a table that reflected my ethos—and for her guidance in doing so. I was also aware of the privilege as one of the first-­ever Asian fashion designers—not just from Nepal, but from the entire continent— to get the opportunity to do so. That fact was not lost on me. I reached out beyond the expected Hollywood celebrities and well-­known socialites to curate a table of exceptional women who inspired me. I invited Deepika Padukone and Alia Bhatt for their first-­ever Met Galas, as well as Michelle Yeoh, Mindy Kaling, Camila Cabello, Ashley Park, Denée Benton, KiKi Layne, Quannah Chasinghorse, and Grace Elizabeth. Together we checked many boxes: Asian, Black, Latinx, and Indigenous, each woman undeniably chic and powerful, a dazzling array of skin tones and experiences that proved my decades‑in‑the-­making hypothesis: everything is better in color.

    "title": "‘Last of Us’ Star Isabela Merced Thinks Dina “Doesn’t Even Know the Word ‘Bisexual’”",
    "article_text": "“What the fuck is wrong with Seattle?” It’s a fair question for Dina (Isabela Merced) to ask in Sunday’s jam-packed—and gory—episode ofThe Last of Us,“Day One.” On their first day in Seattle, Dina and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) discover two separate groups of dead bodies, including soldiers with their guts literally hanging out; escape a horde of zombies in the subway system; and have to cope with Ellie taking a bite to protect Dina, and Dina subsequently preparing to kill Ellie, not knowing that Ellie is actually immune to cordyceps. They also see their relationship completely change, as Dina reveals she’s pregnant, then immediately rushes to kiss Ellie. Quite the eventful road trip! As a fan of the video game on which the series is based, Merced was eagerly anticipating many of the events that play out in Sunday’s episode—and she’s even more thrilled with some of the tweaks made by the creative team. Here, she digs into “Day One,” including why she wanted the audience to be as conflicted as Dina and the big moment in which she struggled to hold back. Vanity Fair:This is only your fourth episode on the show, and you’ve already had a surrogate father killed, fallen in love, and found out you’re pregnant. Did you realize how fast things would move for Dina? Isabela Merced:It was definitely intense. So much happened in this episode because last episode was the grieving episode. I’d get scripts, and each time I felt there were more lines. That’s when I noticed, Wait, there’s been a shift here. I noticed Ellie sort of becoming Joel (Pedro Pascal), and Dina sort of becoming Ellie from the first season. When we first meet Dina in season two, she and Ellie have already known each other for years. The chemistry between you and Bella has to show that they’ve got a deep bond. Did you and Bella have to work toward finding this dynamic, or was it just there from day one? It was naturally there. The camera test was the first time where I felt like we were Ellie and Dina. Camera tests usually suck—they’re so awkward. But it was super simple, and the vibes were there. There was kind of an instant connection. Bella’s really easy to get along with. They’re the most patient, chill person. I got really lucky because I don’t think my performance would’ve been as good if it weren’t for Bella. You mentioned Ellie starting to become like Joel, and Dina filling the Ellie spot in a way. Do you feel like you’re helping usherLast of Usinto the new version of itself? I felt the shift in the game, too, when I played it; it was a whole other mood. But that’s why it’s calledPart II,though, notThe Last of Us: Into Seattle.It’s part of one big story with at least nine acts and three central characters. I was ready for the shift because I was a huge fan of the game and how they executed it. And a lot of this storyline is thanks to [Last of Usseries and game writer]Halley Gross,who brought Dina and Ellie’s relationship and romance to life. In the game, Dina was not present for Joel’s death—Tommy (Gabriel Luna) was. What do you think substituting her in added to the sequence on the series? I thought it was a smart decision. It showed Tommy being more of a community-centered individual, defending Jackson, and he has this badass,Game of Thrones–type moment. And then for Dina and Joel, we already established their relationship in the first episode, so it makes it even more heartbreaking, and gives more incentive for Dina to want to avenge him. And we will learn more about why Dina is so gung ho to go to Seattle, and then also eventually stay in Seattle, even though she’s pregnant. I think that’ll be really interesting to viewers and help build a bigger picture. I really like the change because it makes Dina feel more fleshed out. Since you weren’t involved in the big Jackson invasion in episode two, the chase through the subway system was your introduction to the zombies. What was it like to get down and dirty like that? The stalkers and infected are basically stunt actors who can dance, and are just really aware of their own body movements and autonomy. They were so welcoming and sweet. I appreciated them being so patient, because there were a lot of times where we were figuring stuff out. That was a really cool scene, beginning with the incorporating of the crouch [movement] from the game and counting the number of infected, which is a callback to the first episode—but with much more dire consequences. I call it the “subway surfer sequence,” because it feels like we are on top of the subway playing the game. Ellie steps in and takes a bite for Dina, and Dina is seemingly prepared to kill Ellie. Do you think Dina was really ready to pull the trigger? I really wanted people to think that I could potentially shoot Ellie in the face—and I also wanted people to feel conflicted with me. Even though they know the truth, that specific scenario is tough, because if she’s telling the truth, it’s terrible, and then if she’s lying, it’s terrible. It definitely was a hard scene to film. I was holding a real gun. My arms were shaking because it was heavy, and it was also in the rain, and those factors all contributed to something that, in my opinion, is really special. After that standoff, Dina reveals she’s pregnant, and she and Ellie become intimate. Just last episode, Dina told Ellie, “You’re gay. I’m not.” Was this near-death experience what Dina needed to realize who and what she wants? There’s so many factors, like her knowing she’s pregnant, and then feeling guilty about her baby daddy and how shitty and complicated that situation would work out with being in love with Ellie. And she’s in a lot of internal conflict. I don’t think she knows that you can be bisexual—I don’t think she even knows the word. And she’s pregnant, and the danger she’s putting her baby in—but I also think she doesn’t really care, because she’s just so devoted to the cause. This sequence didn’t carry out like that in the game, so I think people will be happy with that. In the game, it was a little bit more brushed over. Here, it’s given the time that it needs. I could really see the love in Dina’s eyes earlier in the episode, during Ellie’s performance of “Take On Me.” What were you aiming to convey there? I didn’t want it to be so emotional. I was actually trying to hold back. But it was just a really beautiful moment. That set was stunning, the greenery, the flowers peeking through. And Bella’s voice just being angelic and pure, and also it being a moment of happy grieving. And then, on top of that, Dina is in denial of the situation. I started crying. I think that could be up for interpretation, because I played it various ways, and I don’t actually know which one they chose. But there was a version where I was sad because of Joel, and knowing that the reason I love Joel is because I love Ellie, and the reason I love Ellie is because I love Joel. And then there was another version where maybe it’s just Dina being scared—like, Oh shit, I’m in love with this person. And she knows she’s pregnant by then, so it’s terrifying and complicates everything. You mentioned Dina being bisexual, but maybe not even quite knowing what that means. I got a chuckle out of Dina and Ellie not understanding the rainbows. But then I started thinking—these two have grown up entirely in a zombie apocalypse, so they probably don’t know queer culture. Was that something that you thought about in your approach to the character and this relationship? Yeah, absolutely. I think it contributed to her confusion about sexuality and what it could be. They don’t know what pride is, what the LGBTQ community is. Dina doesn’t even know the wordbisexual.Think about a world without all that. It makes it kind of sad, because you wonder what they’re missing out on—and the preciousness of the inclusion they could feel. And maybe a solution to them feeling like outcasts, where Dina is conforming and Ellie is accepting that she’s not like the other residents of Jackson. Ahead of the season, you were quoted as promising that“the gays are going to be fed.”So I have to ask: Is this what we were talking about? Is the feeding complete, or is the feeding just getting started? [Laughs] I feel like this was the appetizer. I can’t believe I said that. I can’t believe I’ve ever been interviewed professionally. If this is the appetizer, what’s to come for these lovebirds? A lot more backstory. And they’re still holding secrets from each other, so now that they’re this much more comfortable, it’ll be fascinating for them to actually reveal their cards and evolve as characters together. And maybe some other characters coming back and complicating things. It’s still early, but what’s been the experience so far stepping into this universe and its insanely passionate fan base? I don’t think I’ve ever seen somebody do a drag show based off of the IP that I was a part of. There’s a whole drag community forThe Last of Us;it’s got a big gay fan base. And everybody just wants me to get them a “hi” from Pedro. “Oh, Pedro, he is so hot. Have him say ‘hi’ to me.” And I’m like, “Dude, that’s my coworker, but okay.” You’re on a really nice run here, between last summer’sAlien: Romulus,The Last of Us,and your upcoming debut as Hawkgirl inSuperman.Have you been able to enjoy it, or are you too busy to do that? It feels like I’m on a train, and with each project, the train’s going faster. So when the train’s going kind of slow, it’s easier to jump off, but when it goes really fast, you’d probably jump off and die. That was kind of dramatic. But honestly, that’s kind of the way I’m looking at it. You just don’t want the train to ever stop. If it fully stops, that’s really bad whiplash.

    "title": "‘The Last of Us,’ Explained: Who Is Jeffrey Wright’s Isaac Dixon?",
    "article_text": "As the end oflast week's episode,“The Path,” showed us, Ellie’s (​​Bella Ramsey) quest for revenge is leading her somewhere far more dangerous than she could’ve possibly imagined. This week, that danger gets a face:Jeffrey Wright’s Isaac Dixon, leader of the WLF, or Wolves. Isaac gets a hell of an introduction via a prologue set in 2018—ten years before the events of this season. A disillusioned sergeant with FEDRA, the Federal Disaster Response Agency, he is visibly irritated by his reports using “voters” as a slur for civilians. He tells the men riding with him in the armored vehicle that the term dates back to when the federal government took away the public’s right to vote in response to the threat of the cordyceps infection. “Voters,” then, became a cruel joke, a linguistic reminder of authority’s slide into fascism. It seems like Isaac has had enough of all that. When his transport is stopped by a bunch of civilians, he instructs all but one—the youngest of the soldiers, the only one who doesn’t understand how “voters” became a slur—to stay in the truck, which he then tosses grenades into. Isaac subsequently shakes hands with a woman who came out to meet him, and tells the boy beside him to make a choice: Join or die. This is where the WLF is born, or at least, the version of it that Ellie is about to meet. And Isaac is now at the very top. If past Isaac seemed principled, modern-day Isaac seems shockingly cruel. We are reintroduced to him mid-interrogation, as he rhapsodizes about the difference between copper and cast iron cookware for retaining heat. He’s doing this because he’s holding hostage a Seraphite, nude and restrained, whom he intends to burn until he learns the cult’s next target. It’s a mean snapshot of how things are in Seattle: Both the WLF and the Seraphites are locked in a conflict that neither side can remember the origin of, an endless cycle of violence that no one in charge seems interested in ending. To a certain extent, that’s all you really need to know. In the video gameThe Last of Us Part II, Isaac (also portrayed by Wright) gets a lot of backstory divulged in documents you can find throughout the game. Players can piece together how he cofounded the WLF with four others who were dissidents fed up with FEDRA’s tyrannical rule over Seattle, eventually expelling the government by force and consolidating Seattle's population in the SoundView Stadium (based on Lumen Field, the real-life home of the Seattle Seahawks). He is controversial for his bloodthirsty warmongering over the Seraphites, and his iron grip on Seattle’s population doesn’t seem that different from FEDRA’s overreach. But Isaac has also undeniably kept the people of Seattle safe, and that uncomfortable mix of fear and reassurance is what keeps him in power. Once again, due to the structure ofThe Last of Us Part II, and how the HBO show is mirroring it, none of this is going to become clear until the story swings over to Abby’s (Kaitlyn Dever) perspective further down the line. Isaac is, after all, her commanding officer—and it’s also through her eyes that viewers might have the opportunity to see how the regular, non-militia citizens of Seattle are living under the WLF regime. (The SoundView Stadium is an interesting counterpoint to the community in Jackson.) Because our picture is so incomplete, this episode feels like a lopsided, shaky one. It’s good, then, that the rest of it is focused on the budding romance between Ellie and Dina (Isabela Merced). The two are now within city limits, scrounging for supplies. Each finds something of some consequence: Dina gets some pregnancy tests to privately confirm a suspicion that she’s expecting, thanks to her brief fling with Jesse (Young Mazino). And Ellie finds a guitar, sweetly playing “Take on Me” as Dina joins her for a private concert. Joel, Ellie tells Dina, taught her how to play—which gives the close viewer a moment to consider the things about the pre-apocalyptic world that these young people are and aren’t familiar with. Ellie, for example, knows about the Apollo space missions in great detail, and tells Dina all about them. She does not, however, know what a Pride flag is, and neither does Dina. These details—and the aforementioned A-ha song—all come straight from the game, and are great bits of heartbreaking contextualization. Both of them are kids, you know? Unfortunately, they came of age in a world of horror and are choosing to wade further into it. Stumbling across a WLF patrol massacred by Seraphites, they run headfirst into more WLF soldiers, andthena horde of infected as well. In their escape, Ellie is bitten, and Dina sees it—which leads to a fraught moment when they finally take shelter in an abandoned theater and Dina holds Ellie at gunpoint. At first, she doesn't believe it when Ellie tells her that she’s immune, and spends the night twitchily watching over her. Eventually, Dina realizes the truth, and confesses her own secret: Not just that she’s pregnant, but that seeing Ellie bitten made her realize she was going to lose the life Dina had imagined with her. It’s a sweet confession, and they spend the night together. In the morning, Ellie tries to convince Dina that she doesn’t need to come along on this journey of revenge. It’s not clear yet if either of them realize how much bigger the WLF is compared to what they thought they’d be facing. Ellie is, however, concerned about Dina and her child. (“Holy shit, I'm gonna be a dad,” she jokes the night before.) Dina, however, is not having it. She takes Ellie’s hand, and tells her they're doing this together—for better or worse.

    "article_text": "Chan Hoi-yan also says legal ‘loopholes’ need to be addressed as Alliance Medical Group’s suspected shutdown could be ‘tip of iceberg’ A private hospital and a medical centre in Hong Kong have been left in a difficult position after the suspected abrupt closure of Alliance Medical Group left unpaid bills of more than HK$400,000 (US$51,610) and patients without follow-up care, according to a lawmaker and a partner of the business. The number of patients’ complaints, including from parents who paid in advance for their children’s vaccination packages, lodged with authorities and the Consumer Council has reached more than 2,000 so far. Lawmaker Chan Hoi-yan, a member of the Legislative Council’s health services panel, called on the government on Monday to address legal “loopholes”, arguing that the medical group might be “just the tip of the iceberg, given the current economic climate”. She said a private hospital, which declined to be named, was owed more than HK$400,000 by the business and was trying to contact affected patients to ensure they received the necessary follow-up care. “The hospital’s laboratory has been receiving specimens from Alliance Medical Group for conducting tests on their behalf,” Chan said. “Alliance doctors still ordered tests on April 22. This year’s bills are not yet repaid by Alliance, with the amount at least HK$400,000.” The medical group offered services such as prepaid vaccination packages for children at its two clinics in Tsim Sha Tsui and Sha Tin.",

    "article_text": "Pilot scheme targeting respiratory diseases with integrated Western and Chinese medicine treatments is now available at four hospitals Respiratory disease patients can now receive integrated Western and Chinese medicine treatments at four Hong Kong public hospitals under a pilot scheme which aims to alleviate symptoms and reduce side effects. The Hospital Authority said the pilot scheme targeting respiratory diseases had started at Haven of Hope Hospital in Tseung Kwan O in April last year and was now available at Kowloon, Ruttonjee and Grantham hospitals. “This scheme targets patients aged 18 or above who have been diagnosed with asthma, bronchiectasis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and experience persistent respiratory symptoms,” said Rowena Wong How-wan, the authority’s chief manager of Chinese medicine. “After an assessment by doctors and Chinese medicine practitioners in our team, we will invite eligible patients to join the voluntary scheme. The fee for each treatment session is HK$120 [US$15.80].” The Integrated Chinese-Western Medicine Programme now involves 26 hospitals providing stroke care, musculoskeletal pain management, cancer palliative care, cancer care, knee osteoarthritis management and respiratory disease management. Dr Wong Wei-ying, deputy chief executive of Haven of Hope Hospital, said that as of the end of last month, 120 patients, aged 38 to 96, had taken part in the pilot scheme for respiratory diseases. Their average age was 75, with a male-to-female ratio of 3-1.",

    "article_text": "Residents of Delhi and surrounding areas woke last week to severe thunderstorms with intense rainfall, large hailstones and squally winds. The storms arrived in the early hours of the night, lasting six hours before easing by about 8.30am on Friday morning. At Safdarjung, the primary weather station in Delhi, 77mm of rain was recorded, the majority of which, 60mm, fell within the first three hours. The event itself was the second highest 24-hour rainfall total in Delhi during May since 1901. The deluge of rain led to flash flooding, felled trees, widespread disruption and claimed seven lives. Further sharp showers are forecast acrossIndiathis week, alongside thunderstorms across western and central parts where relatively cooler air will become situated aloft through the course of Monday and promote convection. Some forecast models show the potential for thunderstorms to produce very heavy rainfall, particularly in Gujarat and south-west Rajasthan, until Thursday. However, due to the nature of thunderstorm formation, the exact intensity can be difficult to forecast days ahead, and often still proves too tricky to predict on the day. So the conditions in Delhi on Friday morning may not have been a one-off. Cooler air will also bring lower than normal daytime temperatures to these regions with temperatures broadly 3-5C lower than normal, which is typically the high-30Cs . The city of Surat, located in the south of Gujarat, may have temperatures quelled by up to 7-8C during the middle of the week, with temperatures reaching about 30C. These lower temperatures will be welcome respite after theearly heatwave conditions in Apriland the ongoing heat elsewhere in the nation. WesternEuropehas had its fair share of showers too as an area of low pressure swept eastward across the Iberian peninsula over the weekend, which brought clusters of heavy storms to northern France on Saturday. Paris was among the places affected, with bursts of hail across the city covering streets with marble-sized hailstones, and four metro stations being shut down due to flash flooding. This area of low pressure is expected to continue moving east, with Italy in line for stormy conditions on Monday and Tuesday, particularly in the north and west, where the Italian meteorological service has issued amber warnings.",

    "article_text": "President Donald Trump has dismissed criticism over a viral AI-generated image depicting him in papal attire, insisting the backlash is being driven by the“fake news media,”not the Catholic community. The digitally altered image, which shows Trump wearing a white papal robe, gold crucifix, and mitre, was posted on his Truth Social platform and the official White House account on X on Saturday. The post followed Trump’s recent remarks joking about becoming the next pope after Pope Francis’ death on April 21. The image sparked mixed reactions online, with some finding it humorous and others calling it inappropriate. Addressing the controversy on Monday, Trump rejected claims that Catholics were offended. “Oh, I see. You mean they can’t take a joke? You don’t mean the Catholics, you mean the fake news media. The Catholics loved it,”Trump told reporters at the White House. FOX NEWS: Some Catholics were not so happy about the image of you looking like the PopeTRUMP: You mean they can't take a joke? You don't mean the Catholics, you mean the fake news media. The Catholics loved it. I had nothing to do with it. Maybe it was AI.pic.twitter.com/6dvyhGTLHQ He added that he had no role in sharing the image:“Somebody made up a picture of me dressed like the Pope, and they put it out on the internet. That’s not me that did it. I have no idea where it came from. Maybe it was AI, but I know nothing about it. I just saw it last evening.” Trump said First Lady Melania Trump found the image amusing. He then joked,“Actually, I wouldn’t be able to be married, though… To the best of my knowledge, popes aren’t big on getting married, are they?” Despite Trump’s claim that“Catholics loved it,”some church leaders expressed disapproval. Bishop Robert Barron said it“was a bad joke that obviously landed very poorly and was seen as offensive by a lot of Catholics.”Cardinal Timothy Dolan, Archbishop of New York, commented,“I hope he didn’t have anything to do with that... It wasn’t good.” Trump and Pope Francis had a long history of disagreement, especially on immigration. In a letter to US Catholic bishops earlier this year, the pope criticized Trump’s mass deportation policies as a“major crisis”that undermines human dignity. Their tensions date back to 2016, when Francis said anyone who builds walls instead of bridges is“not Christian”–a remark widely interpreted as a rebuke of Trump’s proposed border wall. President Trump and the First Lady attended Pope Francis’ funeral in Rome on April 26. It was Trump’s first overseas trip since returning to office in January. The Vatican has confirmed that the papal conclave to elect a new pope will begin on May 8.",

    "title": "Ex-Bellingcat operative killed himself after being exposed as pedophile – media",
    "article_text": "A child rapist who worked for five years with the Western OSINT agency Bellingcat killed himself shortly before he was due to be imprisoned, recently published Dutch court documents reveal. The operative, known under the alias Daniel Romein, took his life in 2022 after being sentenced to prison for sexually abusing his own daughter. Romein had been involved in the investigation of the MH17 crash by the Western-funded“open-source intelligence”group, as well as in the Stop Child Abuse initiative, dedicated to geolocating explicit materials involving minors. The news was first made public by independent Dutch journalist Eric Van De Beek last month, and the surrounding events were further explored in a piece released by The Grayzone last Friday. Van De Beek said that Romein hadn't died from“cardiac arrest”in December 2022 as previously reported, stating a close friend had confirmed that the ex-Bellingcat operative had taken his own life. The researcher, who worked for Bellingcat between 2014 and late 2019, was sentenced to 36 months in prison earlier that year for prolonged sexual abuse of his daughter, the journalist claimed, citing an anonymized court case on the matter. The case was released by Dutch authorities only in March of this year after repeated inquiries by independent media, Van De Beek noted. The case details the way the defendant abused his daughter when she was between six and 10 years old, which involved oral sex, genital rubbing, and other sexualized behavior. The events, which took place roughly between October 2011 and October 2016, only came to light several years later, when the girl told her mother and stepfather. The court materials quote a lackluster letter of apology sent by the defendant to his daughter when the scandal became public, in which he appeared to blame her. The case also revealed that the defendant had been convicted of possession of child pornography“over 15 years”prior. Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins, when questioned by The Grayzone, denied that Romein’s firing in December 2019 had been related to his criminal past. However, the group’s founder“tacitly acknowledged”that the researcher had been the target of sexual abuse allegations.“It is not clear whether the [court] judgment is about Mr. Romein, as it is anonymized,”he told the outlet in a mailed statement. In August 2021, Romein was stripped of his European Press Prize, which had been awarded for his work on the Stop Child Abuse project. At the time, the Netherlands-based non-profit cited“unidentified substantiated complaints”from different individuals as the reason for its decision. When asked by The Grayzone if the complaints were related to sexual abuse, Higgins stated they were due to the researcher’s“unacceptable online behavior.” Despite advertising itself as an investigative group specializing in fact-checking and open-source intelligence, Bellingcat has received funding from several Western governments. This has raised questions about its credibility, and Moscow contends that it works closely with Western intelligence services to“put pressure on either [Russia] or individuals and entities.”",

    "title": "Western memory of WWII is basically fan fiction",
    "article_text": "Historians seldom completely agree with one another even on some of the most important events of the past. There are different views on various historical events, such as World War II (WWII). With new documents being declassified and new excavations at the sites of the main battles, we are likely to see new theories and hypotheses emerging that will feed more discussions and offer contrarian narratives of the most devastating military conflict in the history of humanity. However, there is a clear red line between looking for new facts and deliberately trying to falsify history. The former is a noble quest for truth and understanding, while the latter is a deplorable attempt to revise past events in favor of political goals or personal ambitions. An honest scholar entering a research project cannot be completely sure what will be found at the end of the road; an unscrupulous politician presenting a falsified version of history knows perfectly well what picture to present to the target audience. Truth is skillfully mixed with lies, while fabrications are dissolved in real facts to make the picture more credible and attractive. The most graphic manifestation of the WWII falsifications is the now very popular assertion that Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union were jointly responsible for the beginning of the war. The narrative equating Nazis and Soviets is nonsensical because it completely ignores the history of fascism in Europe and repeated attempts by Moscow to convince London, Paris and Warsaw to form an alliance against it. Only after the“Munich Betrayal”by the West, the 1938 pact among Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Italy that forced Czechoslovakia to cede territory to Germany without Czechoslovakian consent, did Moscow decide to go for a non-aggression treaty with Germany to buy itself time before invasion. Likewise, the dominant Western narrative of WWII increasingly frames the conflict as a stark moral battle between good and evil. As a result, there is a growing reluctance to fully acknowledge the pivotal roles that Russia and China played in the defeat of Nazi Germany and militarist Japan. Neither do they recognize the contributions of communist-led resistance movements in countries like France, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Greece. This is largely due to ideological biases that exclude these groups from the dominant narrative of“heroic liberal forces”in the fight against the Axis nations, the coalition led by Germany, Italy, and Japan. Instead, the predominant view in most Western countries credits the US as the primary force behind victory, along with limited support from other allies. This reading of WWII has nothing to do with reality, but it nicely fits the now popular Manichean interpretation of world politics. Another typical distortion of history is the selective portrayal of the victims of the war, often shaped by a distinctly Eurocentric perspective. Much attention is given to the atrocities endured by Europeans under Nazi occupation or by Europeans in Asia at the hands of the Japanese, while the immense suffering of non-European populations frequently receives far less recognition. Every human life is of equal value, and all victims deserve empathy. Even those who served in the German and Japanese armed forces during WWII should not be indiscriminately labeled as criminals; the notion of“collective guilt”must not override the principle of individual responsibility for verifiable war crimes. However, it is often overlooked in contemporary Western discourse that the Soviet Union and China suffered the heaviest human cost of WWII – with casualties reaching 27 million and 35 million, respectively. A significant portion of these losses were civilians, and the scale and brutality of wartime atrocities committed on Soviet and Chinese territories far exceeded those experienced in most other regions. Contemporary politics inevitably shapes how we interpret the past, as people often seek historical narratives that align with their present-day beliefs and agendas. Yet history should be approached with integrity, not as a tool to justify current political positions. This is not about defending national pride or preserving comforting myths; every nation, regardless of size or wealth, carries both moments of honor and episodes of regret in its historical journey. A balanced national narrative includes both triumphs and failures. But when history is deliberately manipulated to serve short-term political interests, we risk blurring our understanding of the present and undermining our vision for the future. Such willful distortion is not only intellectually dishonest but could also lead to grave consequences. This article was first published byCGTN.",

    "title": "Why Colman Domingo Dresses ‘To Make People Feel a Certain Way’",
    "article_text": "WhenColman Domingosees the outfit for the first time, he gasps. “I haven’t even put anythingonand I’m overwhelmed.” It’s a warm spring Friday, a few days ahead of the2025 Met Gala red carpet. Domingo, who is a co-host of this year’s event, has just arrived at the Valentino boutique on Madison Avenue with his longtime stylists, Wayman Bannerman and Micah McDonald, and their crew in tow. Inside a private dressing suite upstairs, every spare surface—coffee tables, couches—is covered with cloth-lined trays displaying glittering Boucheron jewels, Omega watches, and silky Valentino bowties the size of bread loaves. Here, Domingo’s custom Valentino look—an ensemble which features a modern zoot suit comprising of a checkered wool jacket and wide-legged trousers, plus a royal blue pleated cape and sequin-embroidered bolero lined with frilly ivory feathers and butterfly detailing—is still hung up on hangers, but the actor can barely contain his excitement. “Did I die? What is this?” “Every detail, oh my gosh. I love the color. It’s outstanding.” “I’m already like, way emotional.” Then Domingo giggles: “Shall we try?” The Oscar-nominated actor is dressed casually in a blackWilly Chavarriatracksuit—an inadvertent nod tohis custom Chavarria ensemblefrom last year’s Met, which paid homage to two late Black style icons, actor Chadwick Boseman and fashion editorAndré Leon Talley. Both of whom have been on Domingo’s mind in the lead-up to this year’s Met, whose theme, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” centers on a vast history of Black history and menswear. A few minutes later, Domingo—holding back tears—reemerges in the suit portion of the Valentino look. “Shall we do cape?” he says with a grin, standing on a platform in front of the large three-panel dressing mirror. An Italian-speaking tailor in a white coat places the cape over the actor’s shoulders, and the room goes silent. A twinkly, cinematic instrumental tune plays over the room’s speakers. The room reaches a consensus: The cape will look great on the stairs. “Bravo, Valentino,” he tells the room, beaming. “Bravo, bravo!” While Domingo and his stylists game-plan the final fit and accessories, they laugh abouta recent tweetthat’s been making the rounds online: “Three things are certain: death, taxes, and Colman Domingo having that shit on.” To be sure, come Monday, Domingo’s carefully crafted, deeply researched ensemble will be one of the most discussed looks of the evening. But there are more surprises in store. Before long, Valentino’s creative director Alessandro Michele, whojoined the Roman houselast spring after two decades at Gucci, arrives in a quilted yellow jacket, red-and-black Buffalo plaid flannel, blue jeans, and baseball hat embroidered with the phrase “Techno is my boyfriend.” Domingo and Michele embrace, conferring quietly as the designer lovingly runs his fingers over the sequined capelet. “Bellisima,” Michele exclaims. Within the next hour, actor Harry Hamlin will swing by to say hello; he’s in the building because his daughter, the model Amelia Gray Hamlin, is also wearing one of Michele’s designs to the Met. So, too, is Domingo’s husband, Raúl Domingo, whom the actor met 20 years agovia a Missed Connections post on Craigslist; he arrives quietly, but Domingo quickly catches his eye from across the room. “Hi, husband,” Domingo says, grinning from his spot in front of the mirrors. “You want to come see what your husband is wearing?” As Domingo wraps up his fitting, the actor and I hop into a black SUV headed downtown to the Chelsea Hotel. In the lobby, we chat about the myriad inspirations behind his Met Gala look (which includes his first-ever custom grill), why he knew he would make an amazing Met host, and the cosmic destiny that he and hisEuphoriacostar Zendaya would become the reigning king and queen of the red carpet. Colman Domingo:This was before I had a conversation with anyone, I thought, “There’s a color. I should wear blue. I should wear what they call theYves Klein blue.” First of all, my mother said I always looked my best in blue. I thought, “Yeah, I want to wear blue. There’s something about blue.” And then I went for my meeting with Monica L. Miller [whose 2009 book,Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity,inspired this year’s Met Gala exhibition], and we went through the boards of what the installation would look like. And then she says, “You know what? One of the original dandies who was a freed slave, he said, ‘I can’t wait to save up to dance on my freedom day in my finest blue superfine wool.’” I literally almost stumbled. I said, “Henamed a color? That’s the color I want to wear!” I presented that color blue to my stylists and to Alessandro [Michele]. I said, “It must be blue.” And then I was going through references of history. I started to really center in on the Moors and North Africans who conquered Spain and in many ways influenced when it comes to jewelry and art and architecture. They were the first people who stunted. They came in wearing all of it. They wore the gold, they wore the emerald and the sapphires, all that. That was a part of their agency. I was having all these conversations, and then I sent all these references, and then I went to the Valentino haute couture show and it was my first haute couture show. I also thought I would love to jump across the ocean and go to another moment when Black men were really actualizing and defining themselves in fashion. And I thought of the 1940s Zoot Suit Riots, Black and brown men defiantly strutting their style. They didn’t care whether or not clothing was expensive or people were using too much. And they were being attacked for it because they were wearing too much fabric [during wartime rations]. But no, it’s expression. And I love all of it. There’s also an element of the outfit with the beautiful blue draping, which is a nod to André Leon Talley as well. Then I have another special moment, but I don’t think Valentino knows. When I smile, I want to smile with my mother’s name, Edith. I’m going to have a grill with my mother’s name. So I’m bringing my mom with me to the Met Gala. And also, it brings it to urban streetwear in the 2000s and brings it forward. First grill. Baby’s first grill. [Domingo shows me a photo of the grill on his phone.] Gold nugget at the bottom because the first ring I ever bought for myself when I worked at McDonald’s was a gold nugget. When I was 16 years old, I had a gold nugget ring, so it has a gold nugget on the bottom, “Edith” on the top. It started right after the Oscars. I was actually nervous because I was like, “Is that too late? Don’t we need to start talking about this and conceptualizing this?” But I went to the haute couture show, because I became a house ambassador for Valentino. And then, I had one meeting with Alessandro. It just gave me more of a sense of Alessandro and his vision and why he’s as romantic and maximalistic as he is. And I wanted to lean into that. I don’t know if I’m really made for every house, but Valentino, I am. Especially one that Alessandro is the creative director of. I knew that we collaborate well together. But I also knew I had to take the reins on it and just set up the inspiration based on the things that I know that Alessandro is interested in as well. Yeah. It sets him up in a beautiful way. You feel that he’s a romantic. You feel like his clothing makes you feel like you’re in a dream. That’s what I like about it too. I just like the idea of a bit more pomp and circumstance in the world. We’re always living in tricky and dangerous times, but our resistance is actually having beauty and love, and it’s got to be reflected in your clothing. I’m having my own personal party on Saturday night. I said the theme is, “Put that shit on.” And they’re like, “What does that mean?” I’m like, “You don’t know what it means? It’s such a reference.“ I’m like, “Put that shit on.” I said, “This is the time to break out those five inch heels and fur. You want to wear triple lashes? Go far. When do we get to do that?” I want to make that part of everyday life, to look like a fantasy. The real world is so harsh. A great way to access this is clothing. Oh, they said there’s a tweet that says, “Three things are going to happen for sure in your life: Death, taxes, and Colman Domingo putting that shit on.” I was like, “What? I haven’t seen that tweet. Where the fuck have I been?” Naomi Campbell told me this, and I was so taken aback by it: She says, “Colman, you’re made for fashion.” And I still was trying to figure out what that meant exactly from people who I believe are in the fashion world. I’d never considered myself to be a model. Yeah, I’ve got style, but I didn’t know that I would have such influence and impact. But at the end of the day, I know it’s because I’m an artist and I’m a storyteller, and that I know what to do with my body, and I know that I like to tell stories with that. I had no idea that I liked the fashion world so much. I love it. I’m like, would I like to be a creative director? Absolutely. Would I like to do a capsule collection? Why not? I would love to collaborate in all these ways. At 55 years old, I do feel like I’m getting another burst of creative energy with another platform that I never expected. There was a shift. Well, I can tell you there was a conscious shift. Because I knew that once I started to understand where I existed in the fashion world, I did certain things. I was actually 20 pounds heavier, and I decided to lean out even more. I’ve always been a lean person, but I just had a little bit more weight on me, like a 55-year-old man would have. And once I did that, I also had more access to clothing. So now I get everything, I have my choice of designers sending me things. I don’t need custom all the time, I can actually just wear straight off the runway. I’ll tell you this, the thing that’s been the coolest thing is, people on the street—you name it, Black, white, old, young—everybody admires fashion, and they get really excited talking about, “Oh yeah, I love the way you dress. You put that shit on.” Old Black ladies are just like, “I love the way you dress. You’re so handsome.” And again, I think it’s always been a feeling for me. I don’t just dress for myself, I dress to make people feel a certain way. I think that’s important. People, they respond to style. It brings out something good in them. Or it could trigger them, and they’re like, “Oh, I don’t know about that.” But I feel like that’s the point of it, too: conversation. Absolutely. They’re very clear about what they like. I love that it’s a convergence of so many people in popular culture, and then everyone’s having their own personal expression and everyone’s got an opinion about it. It’s like sports. It is the Super Bowl of fashion. One of the greatest things that I like right now is as an openly queer man, 55 years old, I have young boys, girls, macho dudes all admiring me. They’re like, “Oh, I love you. I want to dress like you. I wish I could. I think I could.” I’m inspiring generations of men to be like, “Yeah, I want to put that shit on too.” I feel like I have a whole league of people that I’m inspiring, and I see it, and I see the effect. I will take some credit in this interview, for sure. Listen, nobody was wearing hot pink until I wore hot pink Versace in 2021 at that Oscars. And suddenly, it became a thing. Suddenly, it was like everybody was wearing hot pink. And then, I think Valentino did a hot pink collection right after that too. They think, oh, it was a representation of queer culture. I’m like, “Not at all, actually. It was actually my references to Prince and The O’Jays and Teddy Pendergrass, dudes that I grew up with. That was the nod. I said, “You’ve got to think broader than that, than what you see.” So then people said, “Oh, okay. I get it. You’re doing something different.” You know what? If I don’t know anything about myself, I’m an incredible host. I have great parties. I know about lighting and music and guest lists. When Anna [Wintour] invited me to do that, it seemed right on the money. I was so excited. I couldn’t say yes fast enough. I said, “Whatever’s on my schedule, it’s gone.” Thank you. I don’t take any of this lightly. I’m emotional thinking about it right now because I feel like, where I come from, this is beyond anyone’s dreams. It really is. I’m living in my dreams and doing everything I want to do in every way. The idea that there would be a team of people waiting for you in a room, that was overwhelming. Walking in, it’s like a wedding day or something. That’s why I hugged the head designer and asked questions like, “How many people worked on this and how long did it take?” Because I knew that so many people were hand beading, stitching and draping for weeks, and teams of people. It’s overwhelming. I had to keep telling myself, “I’m not going to cry.” I’m a crier. I have not connected with them yet. I will connect with them on the night of, butPharrelland I, we’ve gotten to know each other here and there, because I was working with Louis Vuitton a bunch. And then, I haven’t metA$AP [Rocky], but apparently, his grandmother has a crush on me, which I’m really flattered by. I feel like that’s my jam. I’m really for women 70 and above. That’s my audience. And I think I know why: I’m possibly bringing back some romance and whatever that is. I know that my mother always wanted me to be a gentleman, and I hold doors open for women. And I think that’s what I always aspire to be. Yeah, I’m filming a film with Steven Spielberg. Very unknown director. Exactly. This is a start for him. I’m doing a film with him. It’s starring myself and Emily Blunt, Josh O’Connor, Colin Firth, and Eve Hewson. We’re having a good time shooting that. But I’m doing a lot right now. I’m shooting that right now while I have a musical that I co-wrote calledLights Out: Nat “King” Cole, that is in previews. I’ve been going to previews every night. Dulé Hill plays Nat King Cole and Daniel J. Watts playsSammy Davis Jr.It is so fantastic and I’m happy with it. That’s been going on as well. And then, I’m preparing to give a commencement speech and get an honorary doctorate, my second one, from American University next weekend, the weekend after the Met. So I’m in the middle of a lot of wonderful things right now, which is good. I filmed some of it right before I came here, in March. And then I go back to finish up my work in July. Wonderful. Me andZendaya, we just slipped right into Ali and Rue very quickly. Because we do have sort of, I wouldn’t say father/daughter, but a very big brother, little sister [relationship]. Because even off camera, we talk. We have such deep talks. Every time the camera call’s cut, we’re talking about loss, friendship, style—you name it, high and low. Sam [Levinson] is such a beautiful director. It’s really simple and easy. The content of the work can be demanding, because that’s the nature of the show. I think we’re going to really create a great season three so far. I love every beat of it. Isn’t it wild? It’s wild. We’re the king and queen of the carpet. You’re kind of right. We see each other, but weseeeach other, in a way. I'm usually chill like this, and so is Z. When I see Zendaya, she’s got a tank top on, Dickies, and some Converse. And I’m the same. Someone sees me at the gym or something and they’re like, “I love your style,” I say, “I know I’m totally disappointing you right now.” People who have gym outfits, I still don’t understand, because I can barely get it together. I’m just the most basic T-shirt, shorts. It’s where I can be really relaxed, so I have no style at the gym. Absolutely. But I think that’s also the secret weapon for me. You stunt so hard on the carpet and in the magazines that when you’re just being a regular person, no stunt. Myairport stylehas changed. I shop better for airports, because people will always want a selfie. They’re watching you travel, and you have to look a certain way. I always have a really good pair of suede loafers and a good jacket. I look a bit more dialed-up when I go to the airport. It’s no longer just sweats. This interview has been edited and condensed.",
