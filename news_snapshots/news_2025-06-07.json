    "title": "Musk feud presents 'unprecedented' dynamic compared to past Trump disputes: expert",
    "article_text": "‘The Five’ co-hosts examine President Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s ongoing feud. The ongoing feud between PresidentDonald Trumpand Elon Musk, his one-time \"special government employee,\" has brought an \"unprecedented\" dynamic compared to other famous disputes, long-time Democratic political strategist and Fox News contributor Jacques DeGraff said. After somewhat repeated rumblings from Musk about why he opposed a Trump-endorsed Republican spending package, Trump launched complaints about Musk and began firing back this week, including threats aimed at Musk's business revenue. \"It's unprecedented, but the reality is that what makes it a singular moment in history is that no single figure has ever been able to say, 'I made a president and then (fell) out with that individual,\" DeGraff told Fox News Digital Friday. \"There have been groups, there have been individuals who wanted to pretend that they did, but the record is clear. And, I mean, this man (Elon) brought his son into theOval Office.He wore a hat and didn't wear a suit to the Oval Office. He clearly had carte blanche. … The president, in effect, did a Tesla ad in the Rose Garden … and now they've fallen out in life.\" WATCH: REPUBLICANS RALLY BEHIND TRUMP, CONTINUE TO SUPPORT MUSK AMID 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL' BRAWL President Donald Trump bought a Tesla from Musk at the White House as a show of support earlier this year when the EV maker faced consumer backlash over Musk's political activism.(Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images) DeGraffe, who has been a political advocate and strategist for years, quipped that, ordinarily, \"we would have to go to family court,\" adding \"what's the court here?\" Trump is no stranger to quarrels with his staff. During his first term, his relationship soured with his National Security Advisor, John Bolton, and his press secretary,Anthony Scaramucci,after they diverged on different issues and publicly criticized Trump. But, for DeGraffe at least, this quarrel has \"distinguished itself from anything in the past.\" One major difference he pointed to is the implications for both parties in this spat. LIZ PEEK: FIVE CRITICAL TAKEAWAYS FROM THE EPIC TRUMP-MUSK RUMBLE \"Tesla stockhas dropped $150 billion, Trump stock has dropped but it also occurs at the same time as this legislation and so that is going to have – no matter how it turns out – it's going to have massive political and public policy implications for the country,\" DeGraffe said. \"So this is no small dispute.\" Unlike John Bolton, second from left, and Anthony Scaramucci, second from right, Elon Musk's megaphone may make his falling out with Trump of greater consequence.(Getty Images) DeGraffe also contended that this is \"the first time\" there has been a major deviation from Trump \"from the MAGA side of the aisle.\" He suggested the split could be bad news for Trump and others who hope to see the GOP's budget package pass the finish line in its current form. \"This major split will allow other players to take positions other than the party line, and it gives them room and comfort and cover in order to do so,\" DeGraffe suggested. \"Willsenators who follow Musk, or, better yet, disagree with Musk, face intensely funded primaries? \"That's a consideration that everyone involved will have to take. … As a lifelong Democrat, I'm sitting with my bowl of popcorn saying, ‘Go at it.’ Because anything that slows this horrific legislation has got to be good news to the rest of the country.\" Elon Musk's falling-out with Trump could become a problem for the president, an expert said.(Reuters) CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP However, while DeGraffe sees the Trump-Musk feud as having wide-ranging and lasting implications, GOP political strategist Dallas Woodhouse says he thinks the feud is unimportant to most Republicans. \"I am currently at theNorth CarolinaState GOP convention, and this is not a topic of concern among activists,\" Woodhouse said. \"No doubt it makes for funny and entertaining X posts, but the GOP faithful are laser-focused on growing the new diverse GOP/Trump winning coalition.\"",

    "article_text": "Aaron Rodgers plans to sign with the Pittsburgh Steelers after a long offseason. Jason McIntyre discusses the Steelers’ ceiling with him under center and whether Rodgers can lead the Steelers to a Super Bowl. The worst-kept secret of the offseason is out afterAaron Rodgersofficially joined the Pittsburgh Steelers. It's a one-year-deal for the 41-year-old, who spent his last two seasons with theNew York Jets,each ending in major disappointment. But the Steelers, while opting not to select a highly-touted quarterback in the NFL Draft — they drafted Will Howard in the sixth round — had been targeting Rodgers since practically the start of the offseason. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM The feud between Ryan Clark and Aaron Rodgers is at another level.(Getty Images) Ex-Steeler Ryan Clarkis not a fan of the signing. \"This is the worst-case scenario for Pittsburgh Steelers fans,\" Clarksaid on ESPNThursday. \"It continues to keep you mired in mediocrity. Will this team be better? Have they gotten better in the quarterback room? Absolutely. Will they contend for that championship that Pittsburgh Steelers people and fans and organization think is the standard? No, they won’t. \"They’ll be fighting for a wild-card spot. They’ll probably be home week one of the playoffs and again be looking for a franchise quarterback. \"If you told me you were gonna pair one of this era’s greatest coaches with one of this era’s greatest quarterbacks, I’d expect greatness. That is not what we’ll get. Maybe six years ago, but not now.\" New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers (8) and Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin greet each other after a game at Acrisure Stadium.(Charles LeClaire/Imagn Images) This offseason, the Jets made the decision to move on from Rodgers after two years with him under center. His first season didn't go according to plan after he tore an Achilles in Week 1, but a 5-12 record last season wasn't what anyone at 1 Jets Drive expected with a healthy Rodgers under center. Rodgers was back on the free agent market for any quarterback-needy team. However, the same issue the Jets faced when they were looking to trade for Rodgers with the Green Bay Packers hung over his availability — retirement. EX-NFL STAR TAYLOR LEWAN HAS 'WORST DAY OF MY ATHLETIC LIFE' WITH DISASTROUS FIRST PITCH Rodgers will lead Arthur Smith's offense that won't feature wide receiver George Pickens in 2025 after he was traded this offseason to the Dallas Cowboys. Pittsburgh, though, reached a deal with the Seahawks to land Pro Bowler DK Metcalf to assume that top wide receiver role. Rodgers will also be working with tight end Pat Freiermuth, receivers Robert Woods and Calvin Austin and a young, dynamic backfield of Jaylen Warren and third-round pick Kaleb Johnson. The four-time MVP quarterback did have a strong finish to his 2024 campaign despite dealing with some nagging injuries in the beginning. Through his final 10 games with New York, he threw for 18 touchdowns and only four interceptions.

    "article_text": "Charlamagne Tha God put Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., in the hot seat and asked him why Americans should trust the Democratic Party after the cover-up of then-President Joe Biden's decline. Radio host Charlamagne Tha God reflected Thursday on his interview with Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., earlier this week, slamming the congressman's claim he was not aware of then-President Joe Biden’s decline. Charlamagne grilled Swalwellon Tuesday’s episode of his \"The Breakfast Club\" radio show. He said Democrats \"got on television and pretended to act like everything was fine\" and asked Swalwell, \"Why should we ever trust the Democratic Party after they lied to us [for] so long about President Biden?\" Swalwell defended himself and his fellow Democrats throughout the podcast, claiming, \"I don’t think many of us were behind the scenes, to be honest. I didn't spend much time with President Biden behind the scenes.\" On Thursday, Charlamagne shared his disgust with Swalwell’s answers to his \"Brilliant Idiots\" co-host, comedian Andrew Schulz. Radio host Charlamagne has called out Democrats and legacy media for covering for Biden.((Photo by Marcus Ingram/Getty Images)) CHARLAMAGNE MOCKS SCHUMER, JEFFRIES AND NEWSOM AS HE WONDERS WHO SHOULD LEAD DEMOCRATIC PARTY \"I kept asking him a simple question over and over, ‘Why should we ever trust Democrats ever again, knowing that y’all upheld this lie?'\" Charlamagne said. After a clip of the interview, Schulz responded, \"We clearly can't trust the Democrats that are currently in power that upheld the lie.\" \"Anybody that wants to be the future of the party has to throw the Biden s--- under the bus,\" Charlamagne said. \"Now, Eric and all of these guys are like, ‘But we didn’t know.' You gotta cut it the f--- out! You’re actually around him!\" Charlamagne, like Schulz, noted he has never met Biden in person, \"but we’ve got eyes.\" \"If they couldn’t be honest about that, would they be honest about anything in the future?\" Charlamagne asked, restating his point. He then addressed CNN host Jake Tapper and hisnew \"Original Sin\" bookabout the Biden cover-up as too little, too late. \"You’ve got the same eyes, the same ears that I have. Way before that debate you had to see what we all were seeing,\" Charlamagne said, arguing journalists should have had the integrity to tell people what was going on. \"Maybe that would have pushed him out way earlier.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Radio host Charlamagne Tha God spoke to Rep. Eric Swalwell about the current state of the Democratic Party this week.(Breakfast Club Power 105.1 FM YouTube channel) Schulz, who interviewed Trumpduring the campaign, argued that there is a double standard when podcasters are hammered for not asking this or that question to a politician guest, but those same critics turn a blind eye to legacy media personalities who \"literally protected the guy who was unfit for office.\" Charlamagne agreed, calling on people to hold CNN and MSNBC to the same standard they hold podcasters. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"I think that, like, the legacy Democrats still believe that people believe them,\" Schulz said, drawing laughter from Charlamagne. \"And they are the last ones that believe that.\" Fox News Digital reached out to Swalwell for comment.

    "title": "After its data was wiped, KiranaPro’s co-founder cannot rule out an external hack",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Indian grocery delivery startup KiranaPro’s recentdata lossstory has more holes than Swiss cheese, as the startup remains unclear whether the incident was an internal breach or an external hack. Last week, the Bengaluru-based startup discovered that it could not access its back-end servers and that all its data, including its app code, had been deleted from GitHub. The startup on Friday blamed a former employee for the breach. However, in an interview,KiranaProco-founder and CEO Deepak Ravindran conceded that the company had not deactivated the employee’s account after they departed the company and cannot rule out the possibility of subsequent malicious misuse of their account. “If we go deeper, we have to do a real forensic investigation. We are going to talk [about] this with our board, the investors, and we are going to get a formal opinion on that also with our legal advisers,” Ravindran told TechCrunch. Earlier on Friday, Ravindran claimed in apost on Xthat the incident that affected its data was an internal breach. “After careful investigation, we conclude that this was not a hack. No external party penetrated our ordering or payment systems, exploited vulnerabilities, or bypassed security protocols,” he wrote. The co-founder also explicitly shared a screenshot of a LinkedIn profile of one of KiranaPro’s former employees on X on Thursday, alleging that they had deleted the startup’s code. (TechCrunch is not sharing the post’s link, as the startup has yet to offer concrete proof supporting its position.) “[T]his was an internal data breach. Specifically, it was the result of actions taken by a trusted internal employee who had legitimate access to our systems,” the co-founder wrote in his post on Friday. “This individual intentionally deleted critical server logs while they were being tested and/or edited, an action that goes directly against our policies, our principles, and the trust we place in our team.” When TechCrunch asked if KiranaPro could rule out whether any third party had maliciously gained access to the former employee’s account, Ravindran could not. “We have to do a complete forensic check on the company. We have to do the entire IP scan. We have to look at where the tracks happened. We have to check the computers, MacBooks, and whatever is used. Everything has to be done. Then we have to spend money … so, that’s why we decided not to,” he told TechCrunch. Then what was the basis of Ravindran’s allegation? It was a GitHub response, a copy of which he shared with TechCrunch. The response included a username, which Ravindran said was associated with the former employee. “All we have is the emails that we got from GitHub, stating that [the former employee’s username] as an individual is the one who deleted the account. We haven’t done the investigation further,” Ravindran told TechCrunch. Launched in late 2024, KiranaPro operates as a buyer app on the Indian government’s Open Network for Digital Commerce. The startup allows more than 55,000 customers in 50 cities to purchase groceries from their local shops and nearby supermarkets using its voice-based interface. The company also supports local language inputs, including English, Hindi, Malayalam, and Tamil. Ravindran stated that they decided to call out the former employee based on the company’s “belief system,” as they claim the former employee deleted the data after their sudden termination. However, the startup said it is not aware if there were enough protections on the former employee’s devices, such asmulti-factor authentication, to restrict malicious third-party access, like malware. The company confirmed it did not remove the employee’s access to its data and GitHub account following his departure. “Employee offboarding was not being handled properly because there was no full-time HR,” KiranaPro’s chief technology officer, Saurav Kumar, confirmed to TechCrunch. Alongside its code saved in GitHub, KiranaPro  also lost access to its Amazon Web Services (AWS) account, which included its customer data and their transaction details. Ravindran told TechCrunch that the GitHub data was restored after getting its backup from one of their employees. The startup also regained access to its AWS account along with its customer data. Both the co-founder and CTO said the AWS account was protected by multi-factor authentication, but neither could say how the account was accessed, as nobody else had physical access to Ravindran’s phone, which generates the multi-factor code. Nonetheless, Ravindran claimed that the customer data stored in the AWS cloud remained intact and was not accessed by any third parties, nor was it downloaded by the former employee in question. “Because if that is the case, I will get its notification on email or anything [sic],” he said. That said, Ravindran stated that the startup has enough evidence to file a formal complaint with the police, but said that its investigation is ongoing. The startup has also not fully paid its current employees, the company’s co-founder confirmed, soon after the company raised a seed round of ₹100 million Indian rupees (about $1.2 million), which Ravindran said has yet to be fully wired. The startup counts Blume Ventures, Unpopular Ventures, and Turbostart among its institutional venture backers, as well as Olympic medalist PV Sindhu and Boston Consulting Group managing director Vikas Taneja among its angel investors.

    "title": "Government struggles to cut foreign aid spent on asylum hotels",
    "article_text": "The government is struggling to cut the amount of foreign aid it spends on hotel bills for asylum seekers in the UK, the BBC has learnt. New figures released quietly by ministers in recent days show the Home Office plans to spend £2.2bn of overseas development assistance (ODA) this financial year - that is only marginally less than the £2.3bn it spent in 2024/25. The money is largely used to cover the accommodation costs of thousands of asylum seekers who have recently arrived in the UK. The Home Office said it was committed to ending asylum hotels and was speeding up asylum decisions to save taxpayers' money. The figures were published on the Home Office website with no accompanying notification to media. Foreign aid is supposed to be spent alleviating poverty by providing humanitarian and development assistance overseas. But under international rules, governments can spend some of their foreign aid budgets at home to support asylum seekers during the first year after their arrival. According to the most recent Home Office figures, there are about 32,000 asylum seekers in hotels in the UK. Labour promised in its manifesto to \"end asylum hotels, saving the taxpayer billions of pounds\". Contracts signed by the Conservative government in 2019 were expected to see £4.5bn of public cash paid to three companies to accommodate asylum seekers over a 10-year period. Buta report by spending watchdog the National Audit Office (NAO) in Maysaidthat number was expected to be £15.3bn. On June 3, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told the Home Affairs Committee she was \"concerned about the level of money\" being spent on asylum seekers' accommodation and added: \"We need to end asylum hotels altogether.\" The Home Office said it was trying to bear down on the numbers by reducing the time asylum seekers can appeal against decisions. It is also planning to introduce tighter financial eligibility checks to ensure only those without means are housed. But Whitehall officials and international charities have said the Home Office has no incentive to reduce ODA spending because the money does not come out of its budgets. The scale of government aid spending on asylum hotels has meant huge cuts in UK support for humanitarian and development priorities across the world. Those cuts have been exacerbated by the government's reductions to the overall ODA budget. In February, Sir Keir Starmer said he would cut aid spending from0.5% of gross national income to 0.3% by 2027- a fall in absolute terms of about £14bn to some £9bn. Such was the scale of aid spending on asylum hotels in recent years that the previous Conservative government gave the Foreign Office an extra £2bn to shore up its humanitarian commitments overseas. But Labour has refused to match that commitment. Gideon Rabinowitz, director of policy at the Bond network of development organisations, said:  \"Cutting the UK aid budget while using it to prop up Home Office costs is a reckless repeat of decisions taken by the previous Conservative government. \"Diverting £2.2bn of UK aid to cover asylum accommodation in the UK is unsustainable, poor value for money, and comes at the expense of vital development and humanitarian programmes tackling the root causes of poverty, conflict and displacement. \"It is essential that we support refugees and asylum seekers in the UK, but the government should not be robbing Peter to pay Paul.\" Sarah Champion, chair of the International Development Committee, said the government was introducing \"savage cuts\" to its ODA spending, risking the UK's development priorities and international reputation, while \"Home Office raids on the aid budget\" had barely reduced. \"Aid is meant to help the poorest and most vulnerable across the world: to alleviate poverty, improve life chances and reduce the risk of conflict,\" she said. \"Allowing the Home Office to spend it in the UK makes this task even harder.\" \"The government must get a grip on spending aid in the UK,\" she said. \"The Spending Review needs to finally draw a line under this perverse use of taxpayer money designed to keep everyone safe and prosperous in their own homes, not funding inappropriate, expensive accommodation here.\" Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said: \"Labour promised in their manifesto to end the use of asylum hotels for illegal immigrants. But the truth is there are now thousands more illegal migrants being housed in hotels under Labour. \"Now these documents reveal that Labour are using foreign aid to pay for asylum hotel accommodation – yet another promise broken.\" A Home Office spokesperson said: \"We inherited an asylum system under exceptional pressure, and continue to take action, restoring order, and reduce costs. This will ultimately reduce the amount of Official Development Assistance spent to support asylum seekers and refugees in the UK. \"We are immediately speeding up decisions and increasing returns so that we can end the use of hotels and save the taxpayer £4bn by 2026.\" The award is for its work with refugee groups \"both on and off stage\", the theatre says. Denmark has come under international attention for its tough approach. And its Social Democrat prime minister is leading the charge A report into the disorder in Bristol in August 2024 has been published. The law would aim to restrict asylum applications and expand authorities' ability to inspect mail. New figures show the number of \"red days\" - when conditions are considered favourable for crossings.",

    "title": "US brings man wrongly deported to El Salvador back to face charges",
    "article_text": "Kilmar Ábrego García, a 29-year-old from El Salvador mistakenly deported in March, has been returned to the US to face prosecution on two federal criminal charges. He has been accused of participating in a trafficking conspiracy over several years to move undocumented migrants from Texas to other parts of the country. El Salvador agreed to release Mr Ábrego García after the US presented it with an arrest warrant, Attorney General Pam Bondi said on Friday. His lawyer called the charges \"preposterous\". The White House had been resisting a US Supreme Court order from April to \"facilitate\" his return after he was sent to a jail in El Salvador alongside more than 250 other deportees. In a two-count grand jury indictment, filed in a Tennessee court last month and unsealed on Friday, Mr Ábrego García was charged with one count of conspiracy to transport aliens and a second count of unlawful transportation of undocumented aliens. Bondi said the grand jury had found that Mr Ábrego García had played a \"significant role\" in an alien smuggling ring, bringing in thousands of illegal immigrants to the US. The allegations, which date back to 2016, allege he transported undocumented individuals between Texas and Maryland and other states more than 100 times. The indictment additionally alleges he transported members of MS-13, designated a foreign terrorist organisation by the US. The Trump administration had previously alleged Mr Ábrego García was a member of the transnational Salvadorian gang, which he has denied. Bondi also accused Mr Ábrego García of trafficking weapons and narcotics into the US for the gang, though he was not charged with any related offences. He appeared in court for an initial hearing on Friday in Nashville, Tennessee. An arraignment hearing is scheduled 13 June, where US Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes will determine if there are grounds to keep him detained ahead of his trial. For now, Mr Ábrego García remains in federal custody. Mr Ábrego García's lawyers have previously argued that he has never been convicted of any criminal offence, including gang membership, in the US or in El Salvador. Simon Sandoval Moshenberg, one of his attorneys, called the charges \"preposterous\" and the events an \"abuse of power\" at a Friday news conference. \"The government disappeared Kilmar to a foreign prison in violation of a court order,\" Mr Moshenberg said. \"Now, after months of delay and secrecy, they're bringing him back, not to correct their error but to prosecute him.\" He added: \"This is an abuse of power, not justice. The government should give him a full and fair trial in front of the same immigration judge who heard the case in 2019.\" Speaking to reporters on Friday, President Donald Trump called Mr Ábrego García a \"bad guy\" and said the Department of Justice had made the right decision to return him to US soil to face trial. Mr Ábrego García entered the US illegally as a teenager from El Salvador. In 2019, he was arrested with three other men in Maryland and detained by federal immigration authorities. But an immigration judge granted him protection from deportation on the grounds that he might be at risk of persecution from local gangs in his home country On 15 March, he was deported amid an immigration crackdown by the Trump administration, after Trump invoked theAlien Enemies Act, a wartime law that allows presidents to detain or deport the natives and citizens of an enemy country. Mr Ábrego García was taken to the Cecot mega-prison in El Salvador, known for its brutal conditions. While government lawyers initially said he was taken there as a result of \"administrative error\", the Trump administration refused to order his return. Whether or not the government had to \"facilitate\" his return to his home in the US state of Maryland became the subject of a weeks-long legal and political battle. After Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen demanded to see Mr Ábrego García in El Salvador, he was released to a different prison in that country. On Friday, Van Hollen reiterated that \"this is not about the man, it's about his constitutional rights - and the rights of all\". \"The administration will now have to make its case in the court of law, as it should have all along.\" El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, a close ally of Trump, said on social media on Friday that if the administration \"request the return of a gang member to face charges, of course we wouldn't refuse\". Mr Ábrego García is expected to make an initial appearance at a Tennessee court on Friday, where US will request he be held in pretrial custody \"because he poses a danger to the community and a serious risk of flight\", according to the detention motion. Five people are killed in a drone and missile attack on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, officials say. The BBC’s Nomia Iqbal speaks to voters in Philadelphia, where the tech billionaire campaigned for the president and even gave away a few $1m cheques. Experts say his tech empire needs more of Musk's attention - but also the continued custom of the government. The \"Devil in the Ozarks\" escaped on 25 May by wearing a disguise meant to \"mimic law enforcement\". Leaders of the far-right group, who were convicted and later pardoned, allege their constitutional rights were violated.",

    "title": "MI5 misled watchdog about neo-Nazi spy case after lying in court",
    "article_text": "The watchdog charged with holding MI5 to account rewrote a report into the handling of a violent neo-Nazi agent after the Security Service gave it false information, the BBC can reveal. An early draft of the report by the Investigatory Powers Commissioner's Office (IPCO) contradicted false evidence given by MI5 to court, but the final version did not. IPCO told the BBC it was \"misled\" by the Security Service. MI5 director general Sir Ken McCallum apologised to IPCO, after the BBC challenged the Security Service's false statements to the courts. The revelation means that MI5 has effectively given false evidence in this case to every organisation or court which is supposed to have access to the Security Service's secrets and is responsible for holding it to account. It also raises questions about how easily IPCO accepts false assurances from MI5, when it is supposed to ensure the Security Service works within the law and in the public interest. IPCO began its secret investigation into MI5's handling of the agent - a genuine neo-Nazi known publicly as X who informed on extremist networks – in 2022. It was prompted bya BBC story about how X used his Security Service role to coerce and terrorise his then-girlfriend, known publicly as \"Beth\". MI5 had told me he was an agent in 2020 while trying to stop me running a news story about the man's extremism. I had already heard he was an agent, also known as a covert human intelligence source (Chis), and told MI5 as much. The calls were an attempt by MI5 to protect and cover for X, a violent misogynistic abuser with paedophilic tendencies. Telling me he was an agent was inconsistent with MI5's public claims about always abiding by a core secrecy policy – known as neither confirm nor deny (NCND) – on the status of agents. But the Security Service maintained it had stuck by the NCND policy - first in a court case where the government tried to prevent the BBC from publishing a story about X, and then in two further courts where Beth made a claim against MI5. Keeping X's status officially secret meant that key evidence was withheld from Beth. IPCO's role is to inspect the use of investigatory powers by MI5, such as its use of agents, and to identify any concerns in its reports. It reviewed MI5 documents about the case of agent X,  including an official record authorising a departure from NCND, and sent a draft report to MI5 in February 2023. The report concluded that MI5 had taken the \"extraordinary\" decision to depart from NCND on X's agent status in calls with me. But MI5 pushed back and denied it had departed from the policy, including in correspondence with the Investigatory Powers Commissioner himself Sir Brian Leveson, a former High Court judge best known for chairing a public inquiry into the culture and standards of the media. MI5 told IPCO: \"We would like to make clear that we did not in fact take any such decision. [X's] status was not disclosed to the BBC either at that time or subsequently.\" In December 2023 Sir Brian wrote back, saying that \"based on the records available\" it was \"entitled to conclude as a justifiable inference, on the balance of probabilities, that MI5 disclosed [X's] role as a CHIS\". He said that MI5 had provided no documentary evidence to support its position, nor any explanation about how it had convinced me not to run a story about X, as the Security Service had claimed. \"I note that MI5 has not disputed that disclosure was, at least, contemplated… either there was inadequate record keeping or there has been a failure to make records available to inspectors. Either would represent a serious compliance failure,\" he said. MI5 refused to back down and IPCO changed its position, with the final report falsely saying that there was no departure from NCND. The final version introduced three significant falsehoods. First, the report said that \"an operational plan was agreed that there would be no disclosure that X was an MI5 CHIS\". This was the opposite of the truth. MI5's entire operational plan involved a sustained attempt to persuade me to stop doing a story by disclosing that X was an agent. Second, the report said \"it was not MI5 policy to record all such exchanges\" with journalists. This was untrue. There was a policy requiring such exchanges to be recorded. Third, the report referenced a High Court witness statement I had given and said: \"De Simone's witness statement confirms that no disclosure of X's status as a CHIS was made.\" This was false. My witness statement said no such thing. When contacted by the BBC, IPCO said it was \"misled into amending our draft report to remove the finding that Agent X's status had been disclosed.\" IPCO said the first two falsehoods were included due to \"assurances provided by MI5\" and that it is now \"clear that this information was incorrect and that the findings in our draft report reflected the true position\". Regarding the false information about my witness statement, IPCO said: \"We accept that this line in the report reflects our interpretation of your statement based on the information available to us at the time.\" The BBC challenged MI5 on its false evidence late last year, leading tothe Security Service apologising in the High Court. MI5 promised to transparently investigate what happened, and produced new witness statements from the senior officer in charge of the MI5 team who handled X and MI5's director general of strategy - who is in effect third-in-command of the Security Service. But neither of them told the court about the IPCO reports, even in the closed, secret part of the case intended to allow MI5 to disclose sensitive evidence. The judge, Mr Justice Chamberlain, only learned about the IPCO report afterhe had made MI5 hand over another secret documentwhich mentioned it. MI5 made further witness statements apologising to the court, with the senior officer in charge of the team who handled X saying that \"on reflection\" they recognised the \"IPCO issue\" should have been revealed earlier. \"I apologise for not recognising the importance of explaining the IPCO aspect,\" the director general of strategy said, but he insisted there had been no \"attempt to conceal or obscure that aspect of the background\". The BBC was only told about the IPCO issue last week, with further information then provided after MI5 abandoned an attempt to keep applying its NCND secrecy policy on X's agent status. Followinga High Court hearing on Tuesday, a panel of senior judges is considering what to do next about MI5's false evidence. MI5's internal review into the false evidence said it was a result of mistakes, poor memories and bad record-keeping. The BBC said there is evidence of lies by MI5 officers, the internal inquiry was lacklustre and MI5 tried to keep damning material from the court. IPCO said its investigation of how MI5 had managed Agent X found a \"critical failure to create and maintain accurate documentary records; a finding which was reinforced in the final report due to MI5's inability to produce any contemporaneous records and the length of time taken to respond to our requests for supporting evidence\". In IPCO's most recent annual report, published in the past few days, Sir Brian referred to Agent X, saying: \"Recent developments in this case mean that we are keeping it under review.\"",

    "title": "Biggest drone strike hits Ukraine's second city",
    "article_text": "At least three people have been killed and another 17 injured in the biggest Russian drone attack on Ukraine's second-largest city of Kharkiv, the mayor says. Ihor Terekhov says that overnight Russia launched 48 drones, as well as two missiles and four gliding bombs. \"We have a lot of damage,\" he says, adding that three high-rising residential buildings were hit. Footage has emerged showing several storeys of one such building on fire. Six people were killed and 80 injured across Ukraine the previous night, when Russia attacked the country with more than 400 drones and nearly 40 missiles. Russia said that aerial attack was in response to \"terrorist acts by the Kyiv regime\", claiming that military sites were targeted. It came days after Ukraine's daring drone strikes targeting Russian strategic warplanes at four air bases deep inside the country. Ukraine's security service SBU said at least 40 Russian aircraft were struck during itsOperation Spider Web last Sunday. Ukraine says 117 drones were used: they were first smuggled into Russia, then placed inside wooden cabins mounted on the back of lorries and concealed below remotely operated detachable roofs. The lorries were then apparently driven to locations near the Russian air bases by drivers who were seemingly unaware of their cargo. The drones were then launched remotely. Speaking to reporters late on Friday, US President Donald Trump said that the Ukrainians had given Russian President Vladimir Putin \"a reason to go in and bomb the hell out of them last night\". Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Five people are killed in a drone and missile attack on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, officials say.

    "title": "We always joked dad looked nothing like his parents - then we found out why",
    "article_text": "Matthew's dad had brown eyes and black hair. His grandparents had piercing blue eyes. There was a running joke in his family that \"dad looked nothing like his parents\", the teacher from southern England says. It turned out there was a very good reason for this. Matthew's father had been swapped at birth in hospital nearly 80 years ago. He died late last year before learning the truth of his family history. Matthew - not his real name - contacted the BBC after wereported on the case of Susan, who received compensation from an NHS trust after a home DNA test revealed she had been accidentally switched for another baby in the 1950s. BBC News is now aware of five cases of babies swapped by mistake in maternity wards from the late 1940s to the 1960s. Lawyers say they expect more people to come forward driven by the increase in cheap genetic testing. During the pandemic, Matthew started looking for answers to niggling questions about his family history. He sent off a saliva sample in the post to be analysed. The genealogy company entered his record into its vast online database, allowing him to view other users whose DNA closely matched his own. \"Half of the names I'd just never heard of,\" he says. \"I thought, 'That's weird', and called my wife to tell her the old family joke might be true after all.\" Matthew then asked his dad to submit his own DNA sample, which confirmed he was even more closely related to the same group of mysterious family members. Matthew started exchanging messages with two women who the site suggested were his father's cousins. All were confused about how they could possibly be related. Working together, they eventually tracked down birth records from 1946, months after the end of World War Two. The documents showed that one day after his father was apparently born, another baby boy had been registered at the same hospital in east London. That boy had the same relatively unusual surname that appeared on the mystery branch of the family tree, a link later confirmed by birth certificates obtained by Matthew. It was a lightbulb moment. \"I realised straight away what must have happened,\" he says. \"The only explanation that made sense was that both babies got muddled up in hospital.\" Matthew and the two women managed to construct a brand new family tree based on all of his DNA matches. \"I love a puzzle and I love understanding the past,\" he says. \"I'm quite obsessive anyway, so I got into trying to reverse engineer what had happened.\" Before World War Two, most babies in the UK were born at home, or in nursing homes, attended by midwives and the family doctor. That started to change as the country prepared for the launch of the NHS in 1948, and very gradually, more babies were delivered in hospital, where newborns were typically removed for periods to be cared for in nurseries. \"The baby would be taken away between feeds so that the mother could rest, and the baby could be watched by either a nursery nurse or midwife,\" says Terri Coates, a retired lecturer in midwifery, and former clinical adviser onBBC series Call The Midwife. \"It may sound paternalistic, but midwives believed they were looking after mums and babies incredibly well.\" It was common for new mothers to be kept in hospital for between five and seven days, far longer than today. To identify newborns in the nursery, a card would be tied to the end of the cot with the baby's name, mother's name, the date and time of birth, and the baby's weight. \"Where cots rather than babies were labelled, accidents could easily happen\", says Ms Coates, who trained as a nurse herself in the 1970s and a midwife in 1981. \"If there were two or more members of staff in the nursery feeding babies, for example, a baby could easily be put down in the wrong cot.\" By 1956, hospital births were becoming more common, and midwifery textbooks were recommending that a \"wrist name-tape\" or \"string of lettered china beads\" should be attached directly to the newborn. A decade later, by the mid-1960s, it was rare for babies to be removed from the delivery room without being individually labelled. Stories of babies being accidentally switched in hospital were very rare at the time, thoughmore are now coming to light thanks to the boom in genetic testing and ancestry websites. The day after Jan Daly was born at a hospital in north London in 1951, her mother immediately complained that the baby she had been given was not hers. \"She was really stressed and crying, but the nurses assured her she was wrong and the doctor was called in to try to calm her,\" Jan says. The staff only backed down when her mum told them she'd had a fast, unassisted delivery, and pointed out the clear forceps marks on the baby's head \"I feel for the other mother who had been happily feeding me for two days and then had to give up one baby for another,\" she says. \"There was never any apology, it was just 'one of those silly errors', but the trauma affected my mother for a long time.\" Matthew's father, an insurance agent from the Home Counties, was a keen amateur cyclist who spent his life following the local racing scene. He lived alone in retirement and over the last decade his health had been deteriorating. Matthew thought long and hard about telling him the truth about his family history but, in the end, decided against it. \"I just felt my dad doesn't need this,\" he says. \"He had lived 78 years in a type of ignorance, so it didn't feel right to share it with him.\" Matthew's father died last year without ever knowing he'd been celebrating his birthday a day early for the past eight decades. Since then, Matthew has driven to the West Country to meet his dad's genetic first cousin and her daughter for coffee. They all got on well, he says, sharing old photos and \"filling in missing bits of family history\". But Matthew has decided not to contact the man his father must have been swapped with as a baby, or his children – in part because they have not taken DNA tests themselves. \"If you do a test by sending your saliva off, then there's an implicit understanding that you might find something that's a bit of a surprise,\" Matthew says. \"Whereas with people who haven't, I'm still not sure if it's the right thing to reach out to them - I just don't think it's right to drop that bombshell.\" The recent find went from an innocuous enquiry about a house's history in Purley to Stalag Luft III. Descendants of the Poingdestre family are visiting Jersey from around the world. Researchers in Japan and US have unlocked the 60-year mystery of what gives cats their orange colour. The project has been hailed as a \"major achievement\" by archivists on the island. The UK led the way in this field of science until recently - but now other countries have overtaken.

    "title": "Illegal work arrests surge as police target 'unscrupulous' employers",
    "article_text": "Arrests for illegal work have surged this past year as police focus on \"unscrupulous\" employers who exploit undocumented migrants, the government says. Immigration officers arrested more than 6,400 people in the past year in raids at businesses across the UK, data released by the Home Office shows. It said the figure is 51% higher than the previous year. It did not provide numbers as to how many arrests led to charges, convictions or deportations. It said immigration enforcement officials had \"intensified\" their work to \"tackle those abusing the UK immigration system and exploiting vulnerable people\". Officers had visited more than 9,000 businesses - among them restaurants, nail bars and construction sites - to check paperwork and working conditions. Such businesses had often subjected migrants to \"squalid conditions and illegal working hours\" as well as below-minimum wages. The Home Office said there were a range of industries exploiting migrant workers. In one case in Surrey, officers arrested nine people at a caravan park who had been working as delivery drivers. At one one major operation in March, officers arrested 36 people at a building site in Belfast's Titanic Quarter. Some had breached visa conditions while others didn't have working rights. Immigration Enforcement director Eddy Montgomery said there were many cases where people travelling to the UK were \"sold a lie by smuggling gangs that they will be able to live and work freely in the UK. \"In reality, they often end up facing squalid living conditions, minimal pay and inhumane working hours,\" he said. Dame Angela Eagle, the minister for border security and asylum, said the government would \"continue to root out unscrupulous employers and disrupt illegal workers who undermine our border security\". The government said it had also returned nearly 30,000 people over the past year who did not have the right to be in the UK. It has said it is cracking down on illegal migration, setting out its plans in a White Paper to tighten work visas and those overstaying. It scrapped a special visa for care workers introduced during the pandemic, noting that this had been a pathway exploited by some. There was mixed reaction to the plans, with some business sectors decrying the restrictions on work visas, while some Conservative opponents said the reforms didn't go far enough to stop illegal migration. The most recent data shows that approximately 44,000 people have entered the UK illegally in the year to March 2025, more than 80% through small boat journeys.",

    "title": "‘The US was our El Dorado’: Africans on Trump’s travel bans and taxes",
    "article_text": "When Essi Farida Geraldo, a Lomé-based architect, heard about partial restrictions on travel to the US from Togo as part of thetravel bans announced by Donald Trumpon Thursday, she lamented losing access to what many young Togolese consider to be a land of better opportunities. “The United States was the Togolese’s El Dorado,” Geraldo said. “Many people go to work in the US to save money and support their families or projects inAfrica… This will force the country to really develop stronger partnerships that exclude the US.” Trump’s order, which is to come into effect on Monday, prohibits people from seven African countries – Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Libya, Somalia and Sudan – from entering the US, making Africa the worst-affected continent. People from another three African countries – Burundi, Sierra Leone and Togo – will be subject to partial restrictions, meaning they will not be able to travel to the US on certain visas. For Geraldo, an alumnus of the Mandela Washington Fellowship for Young African Leaders programme instituted by the Obama administration, the new restrictions compound the harm from Trump’s foreign aid cuts, which made it harder for her to access funding for social projects in the tiny west African state. Mikhail Nyamweya, a political and foreign affairs analyst, said the new travel bans and restrictions would “bring about a pattern of exclusion” and “may also institutionalise a perception of Africans as outsiders in the global order”. “In the short term, they will restrict access to education, innovation and professional mobility. In the long-term, they risk alienating African partners,” he said. The White House deputy press secretary, Abigail Jackson, said the countries on the list “lack proper vetting, exhibit high visa overstay rates or fail to share identity and threat information”. “President Trump is fulfilling his promise to protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors that want to come to our country and cause us harm,”she said on X, adding that the restrictions were “commonsense”. This interpretation was firmly rejected by Abby Maxman, the president and CEO of Oxfam America, whosaidthe ban “deepens inequality and perpetuates harmful stereotypes, racist tropes and religious intolerance”. She said: “This policy is not about national security. It is about sowing division and vilifying communities that are seeking safety and opportunity in the US.” The policy has deepened a cloud of uncertainty in the affected countries, especially after the US government announced in May that visa appointments for students wishing to study in its universities had been suspended pending expanded social media vetting. There is also fear across Africa about a proposed tax on remittances under Trump’sOne Big Beautiful Bill Act, which is under parliamentary review. If passed into law, the 3.5% tax could severely dent the GDP of many nations, for whom diaspora remittances are a huge contribution. Geoffrey Gichohi, a 34-year-old nurse working in Minnesota, recently sent money to his mother in Kenya – which is not covered by the travel ban – via an app to pay for a concrete wall and a metal gate at their home. Like many Africans abroad, he regularly sends money to his family members back home who rely on it for school fees, healthcare and other basic needs. A new tax – on top of sending and withdrawal fees – would make it more difficult, he said. “The parents back at home in Kenya are the ones who will suffer because they’ll have limited resources,” he said. “Personally, I hope the bill doesn’t get passed.” Human rights activists have criticised the restrictions and planned tax, saying they unfairly target citizens of countries in the global south. Other experts say the moves could further damage US-Africa ties in an era of rising anti-western sentiments on the continent. Feelings of despair are not universal, however. According to Jalel Harchaoui, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London, many people in Libya will be unbothered by the new policies as the US is not a major travel destination for them. “It’s not good, but it’s not noticed as something catastrophic,” he said. “People are barely paying attention to [the travel ban] or the [proposed] remittance tax … if the same thing had happened to the UK it would be a major event, but not for the US.” Authorities in many of the affected countries are yet to respond. However, on Thursday afternoon the president of Chad, Mahamat Idriss Déby, suspended the issuance of visas to US citizens, citing the need for reciprocal action. “Chad has no planes to offer, no billions of dollars to give, but Chad has his dignity and pride,” he said in a Facebook post, referencing Qatar’s controversial gift to theTrump administration. Over the last year, US and French troops have been forced to withdraw from military bases in Chad, which was previously a key ally in the Sahel for many western nations. The reaction from Sierra Leone, another US ally in west Africa, was much mellower. “We have taken note of this proclamation,” said the information minister, Chernor Bah. “Our understanding is that the decision is based exclusively on visa overstay rates and that it does not reflect the broader state of US-Sierra Leone relations, which remain from our perspective strong and productive.”",

    "title": "Jailed Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong hit with new charges",
    "article_text": "Jailed pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong has been hit with further national security charges, a move rights groups said showed theHong Konggovernment was trying to keep dissidents behind bars for as long as possible. Wong,a well-known activistwho has been in jail for more than four years either awaiting trial or serving sentences, is accused of conspiracy to collude with a foreign country. He appeared in court on Friday to hear the charge and did not apply for bail. Hong Kong’s national security police said in a statement they had arrested a 28-year-old man on suspicion of the offence, as well as for “dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of an indictable offence”. According to the charge sheet, viewed by Reuters and Hong Kong Free Press, Wong is accused of conspiring with fellow democracy activist Nathan Law, who is in exile overseas, and others to ask foreign countries, institutions, organisations or individuals outsideChinato impose sanctions or blockades. He is also accused of conspiring to ask foreign parties to “seriously disrupt the formulation and implementation of laws and policies” in Hong Kong and China, “which was likely to cause serious consequences”, Hong Kong Free Pressreported. The charge comes under Hong Kong’s national security law, which was imposed on the city by Beijing in 2020 after the 2019 pro-democracy protests brought the city to a standstill. The law has beencriticised by foreign governmentsand rights groups as overly broad and ill-defined, and easily weaponised to crush the opposition by criminalising even benign acts of dissent. The Hong Kong and central Chinese governments reject the criticism and say the law was needed to restore order to the city. Wong is due to be released in January 2027. He is serving protest-related sentences, including a 56-month term for his role amongthe so-called “Hong Kong 47”group of politicians, activists, campaigners and community members who held unofficial pre-election primaries in 2020.The cohort were sentenced in November, at the end of Hong Kong’s largest national security trial. Just two of the 47 were acquitted. Human Rights Watch’s associate China director, Maya Wong, called the new charges against Wong “arbitrary, cruel and outrageous”. “While imprisoned under one trumped-up charge, Joshua Wong has been suddenly slapped with yet another as the authorities appear intent on keeping one of Hong Kong’s most influential democracy leaders behind bars,” she said. Amnesty International said the new charges could see him given a life sentence if found guilty. “Hong Kong’s national security law is turning five years old at the end of the month, and these new charges against Joshua Wong show that its capacity to be used by the Hong Kong authorities to threaten human rights in the city is as potent and present as ever,” said the organisation’s China director, Sarah Brooks. “Once again, the vague and sweeping offence of ‘collusion with foreign forces’ is being weaponised to justify an attack on the freedoms of expression and association. “This latest charge against him underscores the authorities’ fear of prominent dissidents and shows the lengths they will go to keep them behind bars for as long as possible – in so doing, continuing a chilling effect on civic activism in the city.” Reuters contributed to this report",

The discovery of remains was made at about 2.30pm on Friday after a search of an area near Good Night Scrub national park, close to Gin Gin, police said. The remains were found one day after herhousemates were charged with her murder. “We always wanted to bring Phoebe home, and we believe that this is the first step in that process,” Det Insp Craig Mansfield said on Saturday. He confirmed police had contacted Pheobe’s family. “We do hope that this development, coupled with the arrests in recent times, will bring some level of closure to Pheobe’s family so they can begin to move forward with their grieving process.” Police anticipated forensic investigations at the site would be finished today. “We will conduct our examinations with a view of trying to determine a cause of death, whether it’s able to be achieved is yet to be determined,” he said.

    "article_text": "Online “ghost stores” falsely claiming to be Australian businesses are providing fake tracking numbers to convince payment platforms they have delivered goods that have never been sent, a disappointed shopper says. Ghost stores are online businesses that only exist in a digital sense and do not have a physical storefront. Guardian Australia hastracked 140 such storesmasquerading as local businesses, which include those selling poor quality clothing and counterfeit labels, while others take customers’ money and fail to deliver anything at all. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email A 63-year-old Geelong woman, who asked not to be identified, said she had a “distressing” and “disappointing” experience seeking a refund fromPayPalafter trying to buy items from the Maison Canberra website in April. She said she had been duped by fictitious advertising on Facebookportraying it as a Canberra-based boutique having a saleafter making the difficult decision to close. Her clothing and shoe orders never arrived. The customer said the seller had repeatedly submitted false evidence to PayPal of deliveries, and she believed the payment platform was siding with the business despite her “efforts to provide clear and legitimate proof to the contrary”. Maison Canberra was built using Shopify, a Canadian multinational e-commerce platform. Neither Maison Canberra nor Shopify has responded to Guardian Australia’s repeated requests for comment. On 31 March Guardian Australia bought a blouse for $69.95 from Maison Canberra. The site sent an email on 1 April saying the item had been shipped but it was never delivered. The site has since been taken down. The Geelong woman spent $490.90 on two orders of clothing and shoes. After seeing she had been charged international transaction fees of $17.18, researching the site and realising she had potentially been scammed, she lodged a dispute with PayPal requesting a refund. She said she had included “extensive documentation” including evidence of what she believed were “fake” tracking numbers. In two separate emails seen by Guardian Australia, Maison Canberra claimed her orders were “on the way” but sent tracking numbers beginning with “UK”. Australia Post declined to comment on whether they were valid. Guardian Australia looked up the tracking numbers on three third-party parcel-tracking platforms, all of which said the orders had been processed by a logistics company in China but had not progressed any further. Consumer experts have said Shopify and Metaneed to take more responsibility for enabling these sites and allowing them to run false advertising but that payment platforms including PayPal also play a role by allowing these sites to use their services. The Geelong customer said PayPal had denied her claim on 29 April and told her tracking information provided by the seller showed that the items had been delivered. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion The woman filed a formal complaint with PayPal on 11 May. But she said she hadn’t receive a refund until 26 May, the day after she told PayPal she would escalate the issue to the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. She said PayPal maintained she had received items from the seller and that her refund had only been granted because they were “not as described”. The customer said she was “appalled by this misrepresentation”. “I strongly believe consumers deserve better protection, and someone must be held accountable,” she said. “It’s so distressing and so disappointing and frustrating.” She said PayPal should have a dedicated fraud or scam category in its claims process to help scam victims seeking redress. PayPal previously said all Australian sellers were verified when applying for an account, before conceding that this may not be the case for online sellers based in countries with different laws and regulations. A PayPal spokesperson said the safety and security of customers was its “top priority” and it invested “significant resources” into protecting them. “Under PayPal’s buyer protection policy, we will refund the full purchase price plus the original shipping charges for eligible claims,” they said. The Australian Financial Complaints Authority declined to comment, saying it could not disclose information about individual complaints. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which has previously said it is investigating ghost stores, declined to comment.",

    "title": "Conference to recognise Palestinian state to weaken scope of its ambition, diplomats say",
    "article_text": "A planned conference in Saudi Arabia this month that supporters of Palestine had hoped would push western governments to recognise a Palestinian state has weakened its ambition and will instead hope to agree on steps towards recognition, diplomats have said. The change to the aims of the conference, due to be held between 17 and 20 June, marks a retreat from an earlier vision that it would mark a joint declaration of recognition of Palestine as a state by a large group of countries, including permanent UN security council members France and the UK. Emmanuel Macron, the French president and a co-sponsor of the event, has declared recognition of Palestine as “a moral duty and political requirement”, but French officials briefing their Israeli counterparts this week reassured them the conference will not be the moment for recognition. That is now seen as a prize that will emerge from other measures, including a permanent ceasefire inGaza, the release of Israeli hostages, reform of the Palestinian Authority, economic reconstruction and a definitive end to Hamas’s rule in Gaza. France and Saudi Arabia have set up eight working parties to prepare the necessary ingredients for a two-state solution, and Macron is hosting a conference of civil society under the banner of the Paris Peace Forum immediately before the three-day conference. The UK is overseeing the humanitarian working party and other working groups cover reconstruction, economic viability of a Palestinian state, promoting respect for international law, narratives for peace and “peace day”, an imagining of the benefits to both sides from a peaceful settlement. Israel and the US have attended run-up meetings to the conference but have not spoken, prompting speculation they may boycott the event. Israel has fought hard to prevent stateless Palestinians achieving self-determination. Polls show only a fifth of the Israel electorate favour a two-state solution and 56% of Jewish Israelis supported the “transfer of Arab citizens of Israel to other countries”. Israel has also approved plans to build a further 22 settlements in the West Bank–the biggest expansion in decades. Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, said it was “a strategic move that prevents the establishment of a Palestinian state”. Macron’s initiative has been described as “disastrous” by the Israel’s ambassador to France, Joshua Zarka. Recognition of a Palestinian state was previously seen as an outcome of a failed 1990s-era two-state plan. However, governments in Europe increasingly doubt Israel has any intention to ease its control over Palestinians and see recognition as a possible lever to force a change of thinking among Israeli officials. Ireland, Spain and Norway recognised a Palestinian statelast year. Macron has insisted he would only recognise a Palestinian state without Hamas–the same stance as the UK. Inan open letterto Macron, The Elders, a group of former senior UN diplomats, say recognition is “an essential transformative step towards peace” that should be taken as a matter of principle, divorced from negotiations over the ultimate form of Palestinian statehood and how and when Hamas should be disarmed. Anne-Claire Legendre, the president’s adviser on the Middle East, has said the conference “must mark a transformative milestone for the effective implementation of the two-state solution. We must move from words to deeds, and we must move from the end of the war in Gaza to the end of the conflict.” She met Israeli officials this week to discuss the conference and Israel’s often cloudy long-term vision for the region. She also met the Palestinian prime minister, Mohammad Mustafa. Israeli newspapers reported the travelling French officials as saying: “The recognition of a Palestinian state remains on the table, but not as a product of the conference. This will remain a bilateral subject between states.” The British foreign secretary, David Lammy, who is expected to attend the conference, is under massive backbench pressure to do more to punish Israel and is, at minimum, being asked flesh out the conditions for the UK recognition of a Palestinian state. Hamish Falconer, the Middle East minister, told MPs this week the UK thinking was evolving. “One reason that the traditional position of the UK government has been that the recognition of a Palestinian state should come at the end, or during, a two-state solution process was the hope that we would move towards a two-state solution,” he said. “Many minds have been changed because of the rhetoric of the Israeli government – the clear statements by so many that they are no longer committed to a two-state solution.” But the British are looking for firm undertakings at the conference on the future government of Palestine, including the exclusion of Hamas from any future governance of Gaza, which is something Hamas itself has appeared to accept in the various plans drawn up by Arab states. A growing number of Conservative MPs have broken with their frontbench on the issue and now back recognition, including the former attorney general Sir Jeremy Wright. France hopes that a group of western states recognising a Palestinian state could be counter-balanced by Muslim states normalising relations with Israel. However, Saudi recognition of Israel seems impossible. The Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, the other co-host, has asserted repeatedly that Israel is committing a genocide, a view that is shared widely by Saudi public opinion.",

    "title": "UK mortgage guarantee scheme due to end with no news on replacement",
    "article_text": "A government scheme to encourage UK lenders to offer 95% mortgages is scheduled to end this month, with no word yet on when its replacement will be launched. The mortgage guarantee scheme went live in April 2021 to help buyers with small deposits get on the property ladder. It allows banks to buy a guarantee from the government on the slice of the mortgage between 80% and 95% of the property’s value. If a borrower gets into financial difficulty and their property is repossessed, the government will cover that portion of the lender’s losses. Not every lender offering 95% mortgages has used the scheme. However, between launch and the end of December 2024, more than 53,000 mortgages were completed using it, of which 86% were first-time-buyer purchases. The government said in February it would be launching “a new, permanent, comprehensive mortgage guarantee scheme” that would “open the door to home ownership for more young families and hard-working renters”. But at the time of writing no detailed information had been announced. The existing scheme is open to new home loans only until 30 June. Ministers had said that by making the mortgage guarantee scheme permanent and comprehensive, “banks and building societies will have long-term confidence to continue offering low-deposit mortgages”. Data issued last week showed the total value of the guarantees provided by the scheme was £1.6bn, while the overall value of the mortgages supported by it was £10.7bn. The mean value of a property bought or remortgaged via the scheme was £211,000.",

    "title": "Ice agents use pepper spray and smoke grenades to disperse LA protesters",
    "article_text": "The Department of Homeland Security conducted raids on multiple locations acrossLos Angeleson Friday, clashing with the crowds of people who gathered to protest. Masked agents were recorded pulling several people out of two LA-area Home Depot stores and the clothing manufacturer Ambient Apparel’s headquarters in LA’s Fashion District. Immigration advocates said the raids also included four other locations, including a doughnut shop. There has not yet been confirmation of how many people were taken into custody during the coordinated sweeps. At an afternoon press conference, Angelica Salas, executive director for the Coalition of Humane Immigrant Rights, said at least 45 people were arrested without warrants. “Our community is under attack and is being terrorized. These are workers, these are fathers, these are mothers, and this has to stop. Immigration enforcement that is terrorizing our families throughout this country and picking up our people that we love must stop now,” Salas told the crowd. The protest only grew as the afternoon wore on. By 6pm local time, hundreds of people assembled around the federal building in downtown Los Angeles, where those taken into custody during the raids are being held. Earlier in the day, armed agents clad in heavy protective and tactical gear, including some who wore gas masks, could be seen on video and through aerial footage pushing individuals and trying to corral large groups that congregated to challenge the raids. Smoke grenades were reportedly thrown near the crowds and pepper spray was used as the federal officers attempted to clear the area. As the demonstrations continued into the evening,videosshowed officers firing less-lethal weapons toward protestors. Some people in the crowd attempted to block large armored trucks carrying FBI agents as they departed. One person reportedly threw eggs at the vehicles. The Los Angeles fire department was called to the scene to administer aid to protesters injured by agents and officers, which included the president of the California branch of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), David Huerta, the organization said instatementcalling for his immediate release. “We call for an end to the cruel, destructive, and indiscriminate Ice raids that are tearing apart our communities, disrupting our economy, and hurting all working people,” Tia Orr, executive director of SEIUCaliforniasaid. “Immigrant workers are essential to our society: feeding our nation, caring for our elders, cleaning our workplaces, and building our homes.” The Los Angeles police department also assisted the federal officers in dispersing demonstrators, despite the department’s insistence that it is not involved in “civil immigration enforcement”, and would only have a presence to ensure public safety. Advocates used megaphones from the streets outside where the raids were occurring to remind workers inside of their rights, the Los Angeles Timesreported. Some called out individual names and demanded they be given access to lawyers. “The community is here with you,” one person shouted. “Your family is here with you.” Los Angeles leaders were quick to condemn the actions, which were part of a string of high-profile raids undertaken by Immigration and Customs Enforcement under orders from Donald Trump. “I am closely monitoring the Ice raids that are currently happening across Los Angeles, including at a Korean-American owned store in my district,” Congresswoman Sydney Kamlager-Dove said in a post on X, along with instructions on how impacted constituents could reach her office for help. “LA has long been a safe haven for immigrants,” she added. “Trump claims he’s targeting criminals, but he’s really just tearing families apart and destabilizing entire communities.” Mayor Karen Bass said in a statement that she was “deeply angered by what has taken place,” and that her office was coordinating with immigrant rights community organizations. “These tactics sow terror in our communities and disrupt basic principles of safety in our city,” she said. “We will not stand for this.” Los Angeles councilmember Eunisses Hernandez said in a statement: “These actions are escalating: agents arrive without warning and leave quickly, aware that our communities mobilize fast. I urge Angelenos to stay alert.”",

    "title": "Federal prosecutor reportedly quit over concern Ábrego García indictment was politically motivated – as it happened",
    "article_text": "This blog has now closed. Kilmar Ábrego García returned from El Salvador to face criminal charges in US A career federal prosecutor resigned in protest the same day that charges were filed againstKilmar Ábrego García, following an investigation that apparently began after the mistaken deportation of the Maryland resident became a legal and political headache for the Trump administration,ABC News reports. Ben Schrader, announced his resignation as the chief of the criminal division at the US attorney’s office for the Middle District of Tennessee ina LinkedIn poston 21 May, the same day the indictment of Ábrego García was signed by the acting US attorney for that district. Sources told ABC News that Schrader stepped down because of concerns that the case was being pursued for political reasons. “Earlier today, after nearly 15 years as an Assistant United States Attorney, I resigned as Chief of the Criminal Division at the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Tennessee”, Schrader wrote on LinkedIn that day. “It has been an incredible privilege to serve as a prosecutor with the Department of Justice, where the only job description I’ve ever known is to do the right thing, in the right way, for the right reasons. I wish all of my colleagues at the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Nashville and across the Department the best as they seek to do justice on behalf of the American people.” At a news conference on Friday, the attorney general, Pam Bondi, refused to say exactly when the investigation that led to the charges was opened, but shetold reportersthat the indictment was based on “recently found facts” about a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee, and that “thanks to the bright light that has been shined on Ábrego García, this investigation continued”. The indictment was signed by Robert McGuire, who has been the acting US attorney in Nashville since December, and three senior prosecutors from the justice department’s Joint Task Force Vulcan, which was created during the firstTrump administration“to dismantle MS-13”. This brings our live coverage of the secondTrump administrationto a close for the day. Here are some of the latest developments: Kilmar Ábrego García, a Maryland resident who was deported to El Salvador in violation of a court order, was returned to the United States and charged with the criminal smuggling of undocumented immigrants inside the United States. Ben Schrader, a career federal prosecutor, reportedly resigned in protest the same day that charges were filed against Ábrego García, following an investigation that apparently began after the mistaken deportation became a legal and political headache for the Trump administration. Donald Trumpsuggested that court orders to his administration to return Ábrego García to the US was a sign that “the judges are trying to take the place of a president that won in a landslide”. One day after his feud withElon Muskexploded Trump claimed that he was far too busy to think about the billionaire donor who had accused him of sex crimes and called for his impeachment. That claim was undermined by the fact that Trump spent a chunk of his morning on the phone with at least three television reporters, gossiping about Musk. Two federal appeals court judges appointed by Trump overturned a lower court ruling to allow him to resume punishing the Associated Press for continuing to refer to the Gulf of Mexico by that name instead of the new one Trump gave it. Two judges appointed byDonald Trumpto a federal appeals court ruled in his favor on Friday, allowing him to resume blocking the Associated Press from covering him at events in the Oval Office, on Air Force One and in his Mar-A-Lago club. The 2-1rulingwas written by US circuit judge Neomi Rao, who served in Trump’s first administration, and joined by fellow Trump appointee Gregory Katsas. The divided ruling by the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit temporarily blocks an order by another Trump appointed judge, US district judge Trevor McFadden, who had ruled in April that theTrump administrationhad to allow AP journalists access to events while the news agency’s lawsuit moves forward. The AP sued after Trump banned the news organization for refusing to follow him in referring to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. The court left in place part of a lower-court order that required Trump to give AP access to events held in larger spaces, like the East Room of the White House. The Department of Homeland Security conducted raids on multiple locations acrossLos Angeleson Friday, clashing with the crowds of people who gathered to protest. Masked agents were recorded pulling several people out of two LA-area Home Depot stores and the clothing manufacturer Ambient Apparel’s headquarters in LA’s Fashion District. There has not yet been confirmation of how many people were taken into custody, but initial estimates provided by news helicopter reportsshows roughly two dozen people were loaded into white vansand taken away. Armed agents clad in heavy protective and tactical gear, including some who wore gas masks, could also be seen pushing individuals and trying to corral large groups that congregated to challenge the raids, and smoke grenades were reportedly thrown near the crowds. Pepper spray was used as the federal officers attempted to clear the area. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on Friday,Donald Trumpsuggested that some sort of unspecified action needed to be taken against federal judges who ordered his administration to bring the wrongly deported Maryland residentKilmar Ábrego Garcíaback from El Salvador. Trump continued to insist that the supreme court’s order requiring his administration to bring Ábrego García back to the United States was incorrect. “He should’ve never had to be returned”, Trump said. “Either way it’s a total disaster – this is a pretty bad guy.” In commentsposted on YouTubeby the Washington Post, Trump seemed to give insight into the political calculation behind his administration’s decision to bring Ábrego García back, as the supreme court had ordered, but first indict him on new criminal charges. “I could see a decision being made” Trump said, “‘bring him back; show everybody how horrible this guy is’”. He then returned to his outrage at federal judges for not allowing him to deport people like Ábrego García who have been accused of crimes without giving them an opportunity to challenge the evidence against them in court. “Frankly, we have to do something, because the judges are trying to take the place of a president that won in a landslide” Trump said. “And that’s not supposed to be the way it is”. Trump seems convinced that Ábrego García is so obviously a gang member that there is no need for a trial. However, the president demonstrated in April that he is deeply confused about at least one piece of the supposed evidence. Ina social media postin mid-April, Trump held up a photograph of the tattoos on Ábrego García’s hand, symbols that one corner of the internet is convinced represent the letters and numbers M,S,1 and 3, to signify that he is a member of the gang MS-13. In an interview with Terry Moran of ABC News two weeks later, though, Trump revealed that he had been confused by the photograph, which added the letters and numbers as a form of annotation. “He had MS-13 on his knuckles, tattooed”,Trump insisted to Moran. When Moran pointed out that the letters and numbers had been added to the photograph he held up to illustrate what people thought the four symbols represented, Trump made it clear that he had mistaken the annotation for part of the tattoo. “Go look at his hand”, Trump said. Now that Ábrego García is back in the United States and will be in court, new photographs of his hand will soon be available for Trump to inspect. Duringa brief news conferenceon Air Force One, en route to his golf course in New Jersey,Donald Trumptold reporters that he has been far too busy to spend any time thinking aboutElon Musk, his top donor and former aide who called for him to be impeached on Thursday. “Honestly, I’ve been so busy working on China, working on Russia, working on Iran, working on so many things, I’m not thinking about Elon” Trump said. “I just wish him well.” The president’s comment, one day after Musk accused him of having been involved in his late friendJeffrey Epstein’s sex crimes, oddly echoed Trump’s response to a question about Epstein’s longtime companion,Ghislaine Maxwell, in 2020 when she was arrested andcharged withhelping Epstein recruit and sexually abuse girls. Back then, when Trumpwas askedduring a coronavirus briefing in the White House if he expected Maxwell “to turn in powerful men”, he responded: “I don’t know, I haven’t really been following it too much. I just wish her well, frankly.” “I’ve met her numerous times over the years, especially since I lived in Palm Beach, and I guess they lived in Palm Beach. But I wish her well, whatever it is.” Maxwell was convicted in 2021 and sentenced to 20 years in jail the following year. Her prosecution was led by Damian Williams, the US attorney for the Southern District of New York. Williams later oversaw the indictment on New York’s mayor, Eric Adams, on corruption charges that were later dropped by theTrump administration. On Friday, Williams left the law firm Paul Weissto join Jenner & Block, moving from a firm that struck a deal with Trump to one that fought him in court. Trump’s claim that he was far too busy on Friday to concern himself with Musk’s criticism was slightly undermined by the fact that he spent much of his morning at the White House talking about Musk to multiple reporters on the phone. WhenJonathan Karlof ABC News called the president at 6:45 am, Trump picked up to talk about Musk andcalled him“a man who has lost his mind”. Trump also took timeto tellBret Baierof Fox, “Elon has totally lost it”. Trump also spoke to CNN’sDana Bash,to insist: “I’m not even thinking about Elon, he’s got a problem, the poor guy’s got a problem”. Bash said that Trump also told her he wishes Elon well. Donald Trump, who is again enjoying a long weekend at one of his golf courses, took a moment to respond, obliquely, toElon Musk’sunsourced claimon Thursday that the Trump administration has not released all of the files from the sex-trafficking investigation intoJeffrey Epsteinbecause Trump is implicated in his late friend’s crimes. During an Air Force One flight to New Jersey on Friday, Trumpshareda comment fromDavid Schoen, a lawyer who defended the president at his second impeachment trial in 2021, over the January 6 riot. “I was hired to lead Jeffrey Epstein’s defense as his criminal lawyer 9 days before he died”, Schoenwroteon Musk’s social media platform X on Thursday. “He sought my advice for months before that. I can say authoritatively, unequivocally, and definitively that he had no information to hurt President Trump. I specifically asked him!” Following Musk’s post on Thursday, which was viewed more than 200 million times (according to Musk’s company), Schoen alsowroteon the billionaire’s platform: “I can tell you unequivocally as someone who would know that President Trump never did anything wrong with Jeffrey Epstein.” A career federal prosecutor resigned in protest the same day that charges were filed againstKilmar Ábrego García, following an investigation that apparently began after the mistaken deportation of the Maryland resident became a legal and political headache for the Trump administration,ABC News reports. Ben Schrader, announced his resignation as the chief of the criminal division at the US attorney’s office for the Middle District of Tennessee ina LinkedIn poston 21 May, the same day the indictment of Ábrego García was signed by the acting US attorney for that district. Sources told ABC News that Schrader stepped down because of concerns that the case was being pursued for political reasons. “Earlier today, after nearly 15 years as an Assistant United States Attorney, I resigned as Chief of the Criminal Division at the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Tennessee”, Schrader wrote on LinkedIn that day. “It has been an incredible privilege to serve as a prosecutor with the Department of Justice, where the only job description I’ve ever known is to do the right thing, in the right way, for the right reasons. I wish all of my colleagues at the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Nashville and across the Department the best as they seek to do justice on behalf of the American people.” At a news conference on Friday, the attorney general, Pam Bondi, refused to say exactly when the investigation that led to the charges was opened, but shetold reportersthat the indictment was based on “recently found facts” about a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee, and that “thanks to the bright light that has been shined on Ábrego García, this investigation continued”. The indictment was signed by Robert McGuire, who has been the acting US attorney in Nashville since December, and three senior prosecutors from the justice department’s Joint Task Force Vulcan, which was created during the firstTrump administration“to dismantle MS-13”. In a new statement, SenatorChris Van Hollen, the Maryland Democrat who visitedKilmar Ábrego Garcíain El Salvador, reiterated the point he made after his trip in April,when he saidthat he was “not defending the man” but “defending the rights of this man to due process”. Here is Van Hollen’s new statement: “For months the Trump Administration flouted the Supreme Court and our Constitution. Today, they appear to have finally relented to our demands for compliance with court orders and with the due process rights afforded to everyone in the United States. As I have repeatedly said, this is not about the man, it’s about his constitutional rights – and the rights of all. The Administration will now have to make its case in the court of law, as it should have all along.” This restates what Van Hollen said inan interview with ABC Newsin April, of the Trump administration: “Here’s where they should put their facts: they should oput it before the court. They should put up or shut up in court.” El Salvador’s president,Nayib Bukele, joined the White House in attacking SenatorChris Van Hollenon social media with a post on Elon Musk’s X in which he referred back to a staged photograph of the Maryland senator’s meetingKilmar Ábrego Garcíain April. Referencing the release of Ábrego García from custody in El Salvador on Friday, Bukelewrote: we work with the Trump administration, and if they request the return of a gang member to face charges, of course we wouldn’t refuse.” He added: “No more margaritas under custody”. On his return from El Salvador in April, however, Van Hollenaccusedthe government of El Salvador of creating the hoax he called “Margarita-gate”, by placing a pair of cocktail glasses on the table between himself and Ábrego García as they met to make it look as though they were enjoying drinks. Those photographs wereposted on Xby Bukele, along with a caption that downplayed the seriousness of the situation by falsely claiming that the senator and the wrongly deported man had been “sipping margaritas” as they met. Butthe senator saidthat the drinks were placed there during the meeting by someone from the Salvadoran government before the photographs were taken and that neither he nor Ábrego García had touched them. Van Hollen pointed out that there was visual evidence for this in the photographs: the rims of both glasses were covered in salt or sugar, but it was clear from the images that neither glass had been drunk from, since the rims were undisturbed. The US supreme court on Friday permitted the so-called ‘department of government efficiency’, or Doge, a team set up by former Trump aideElon Muskto take a chainsaw to the federal workforce, broad access to personal information on millions of Americans in Social Security Administration data systems while a legal challenge plays out, Reuters reports. At the request of the Justice Department, the justices put on hold US district judgeEllen Hollander’s order that had largely blocked Doge’s access to “personally identifiable information” in data such as medical and financial records while litigation proceeds in a lower court. Hollander found that allowing Doge unfettered access likely would violate a federal privacy law. The court’s brief, unsigned order did not provide a rationale for siding with Doge. The court has a 6-3 conservative majority. Its three liberal justices dissented from the order. White House officials have wasted no time in using the newly announced criminal charges againstKilmar Ábrego Garcíato attackDemocratswho objected to his deportation without due process in violation of a previous court order. Writing onElon Musk’s social media platform X, the White House’s official account dedicated to partisan “rapid response”resurfacedan April post from SenatorChris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat whose constituents include Ábrego García’s wife, to suggest that he should now be ashamed of having stood up for the undocumented Maryland resident’s due process rights. “A grand jury found his full-time job was human smuggling, Chris,” the White House account commented. “He spent his entire life abusing people – including women and children. This is who you spent so much time defending. Shame on you.” The White House press secretary,Karoline Leavitt, also using the platform owned by a former Trump aide who called for the president to be impeached just yesterday,claimedthat the indictment against Ábrego García “proves the unhinged Democrat Party was wrong, and their stenographers in the Fake News Media were once again played like fools”. Apparently unaware that the allegations have yet to be tested in court, the president’s chief spokesperson insisted that “Democrat lawmakers” including Van Hollen, “and every single so-called ‘journalist’ who defended this illegal criminal abuser must immediately apologize to Garcia’s victims”. Ata news conference, the US attorney general,Pamela Bondi, just announced thatKilmar Ábrego García, a Maryland resident who was deported to El Salvador in violation of a court order, has been returned to the United States and charged with criminal charges related to smuggling undocumented immigrants inside the United States. Bondi said that the US government presented an arrest warrant for Ábrego García to El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele. She also said that the grand jury indictment on 21 May was based on recently discovered facts and that the grand jury “found that over the past nine years, Ábrego García has played a significant role in an alien smuggling ring.” “Upon completion of his sentence, we anticipate he will be returned to his country of El Salvador”, Bondi said. Bondi suggested that Ábrego García was involved in other crimes, based on what unnamed co-conspirators allege, but he was only indicted on two counts related to the alleged smuggling. In response to a reporter’s question, Bondi said that Ábrego García would serve a prison sentence in the US if convicted, on charges that carry a possible sentence of 10 years, and then be deported to El Salvador again. We are waiting for the start ofa livestreamed justice department news conference, which is expected to deal with the indictment ofKilmar Ábrego García, a Maryland resident who was deported to El Salvador and is reportedly on his way back to the United States to face new criminal charges stemming from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee which prompted officers to suspect that he might have been transporting undocumented migrants. Thecriminal indictment, which was filed on 21 May, accuses Ábrego García of being “a member and associate” of the Salvadoran gang MS-13 and charges him with taking part in a conspiracy to transport undocumented immigrants inside the United States. The reportedly imminent return to the United States ofKilmar Ábrego García, a Maryland resident who was deported to El Salvador in violation of a court order that he should not be sent there because he had a reasonable fear of persecution in that country, comes nearly two months after the attorney general, Pamela Jo Bondi, insisted that it would never happen. “He is not coming back to our country” Bonditold reportersat a news conference on 16 April. “President Bukele said he was not sending him back. That’s the end of the story.” Asked if she could provide evidence that he was a member of the MS-13 gang, Bondi said only that the allegation was contained in a 2019 court hearing. Kilmar Ábrego García, the Maryland man unlawfully deported to El Salvador, is on his way back to the US where he will face criminal charges,ABC News is reporting, citing sources. A federal grand jury has indicted Ábrego García for allegedly transporting undocumented migrants within the US, according to the report. The outlet, citing sources, reports that a two-count indictment, filed under seal in federal court in Tennessee last month, alleges that Ábrego García participated in a years-long conspiracy to transport undocumented migrants from Texas to the interior of the country. Among those allegedly transported were members of the Salvadoran gang MS-13, according to the report. The alleged conspiracy spanned nearly a decade, according to the report. AUStrade delegation including three cabinet officials will meet with trade representatives fromChinain London on Monday “with reference to the trade deal”,Donald Trumphas announced. He posted on Truth Social: I am pleased to announce that Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, and United States Trade Representative, Ambassador Jamieson Greer, will be meeting in London on Monday, June 9, 2025, with Representatives of China, with reference to the Trade Deal. The meeting should go very well. Thank you for your attention to this matter! It comes a day after Trump and Chinese presidentXi Jinpingheld a “very good” phone callduring which they discussed “some of the intricacies of our recently made, and agreed to, Trade Deal”, Trump said. Trump also said Xi had invited him to visit China, an invitation he aid he reciprocated. Xisaid of the callthat a “consensus has been reached”, adding that the two sides “should enhance consensus” as well as “reduce misunderstanding, strengthen cooperation” and “enhance exchanges”. “Dialogue, cooperation is the only right choice for China and the US,” the Chinese president said. Elon Muskmay believe his money bought the presidential election and the House of the Representatives for theRepublicans. But he is discovering painfully and quickly that it has not bought him love, loyalty or even fear among many GOP members of Congress on Capitol Hill. Faced with the choice of siding with Musk, the world’s richest man, orDonald Trump, after the two staged a public relationship breakdown for the ages on Thursday, most Republicans went with the man in the Oval Office, who has shown an unerring grasp of the tactics of political intimidation and who remains the world’s most powerful figure even without the boss of Tesla and SpaceX by his side. The billionaire tech entrepreneur, who poured about $275m into Trump’s campaign last year, tried to remind Washington’s political classes of his financial muscle on Thursday during an outpouring of slights against a man for whom he had once professed platonic love and was still showering with praise up until a week before. One after another, Republican House members came out to condemn him and defend Trump, despite having earlier been told by Musk that “you know you did wrong” in voting for what has become Trump’s signature legislation that seeks to extend vast tax cuts for the rich. Troy Nehls, a GOP representative from Texas, captured the tone,addressing Muskbefore television cameras: You’ve lost your damn mind. Enough is enough. Stop this. It chimed with the sentiments of many others. “Nobody elected Elon Musk, and a whole lot of people don’t even like him, to be honest with you, even on both sides,”Jeff Van Drew, a New Jersey congressman,told Axios. “We’re getting people calling our offices 100% in support of President Trump,” Kevin Hern, a representative from Oklahoma, told the site. Every tweet that goes out, people are more lockstep behind President Trump and [Musk is] losing favour. Republicans were balancing the strength of Trump’s voice among GOP voters versus the power of the increasingly unpopular Musk’s money – and most had little doubt which matters most. “On the value of Elon playing against us in primaries compared to Trump endorsing us in primaries, the latter is 100 times more relevant,” Axios quoted one unnamed representative as saying. The Trump administration is preparing to make good on the president’s threat to strip “large scale” federal funding fromCalifornia, an effort that could begin as early as Friday,according to CNN. The report says agencies have been directedto start identifying grantsthe administration can withhold from the state. A whistleblower reportedly told a congressional committee that the administration wasplanning to cut all research grants to California. The White House has not commented on the plans. The timeline remains speculative, and it is unclear what grants would be targeted. Trump has repeatedly threatened to cut federal funding as a way to force states, institutions and universities to comply with his agenda. Last week, he said California could lose “large scale” funding “maybe permanently” if the state continued to allow transgender athletes to participate in girls’ and women’s sports. The declaration appeared to be in reference to a transgender track-and-field star from southern California. On Saturday, she won two gold medals and a silver, which she shared with other teen athletes under a new rule by the state’s high school sports body. Trump had also repeatedly threatened to withhold federal disaster aid, assailing the state’s Democratic leaders for their handling of the wildfires that devastated Los Angeles earlier this year. More from House speakerMike Johnson, who has told CNBC he has been texting withElon Muskand hopes the dispute is resolved quickly. He said of the “big, beautiful bill”: I don’t argue with [Musk] about how to build rockets and I wish he wouldn’t argue with me about how to craft legislation and pass it. Johnsonearlierissued a warning:“Do not second-guess and don’t ever challenge the president of the United States, Donald Trump.” He had also projected confidence that the Trump-Musk dispute won’t affect prospects for the tax and border bill. “Members are not shaken at all,” he said. “We’re going to pass this legislation on our deadline.”",

    "title": "Arkansas killer and rapist caught after 13-day manhunt in mountains",
    "article_text": "A former police chief who is also a convicted killer and rapist nicknamed the “Devil in the Ozarks” was captured by law enforcement 1.5 miles north-west of the prison heescapedfrom following a 13-day manhunt in the mountains of northern Arkansas, authorities announced on Friday. Grant Hardin’s identity was confirmed through fingerprinting, the Izard county sheriff’s office said in a Facebook post. Hardin, a former police chief in the small town of Gateway near the Arkansas-Missouri border, was serving lengthy sentences for murder and rape. Eventually, his notoriety led to a TV documentary, 2023’sDevil in the Ozarks. Hardin had been held at the Calico Rock prison since 2017 after pleading guilty to first-degree murder in a fatal shooting. In order to escape, he had impersonated a corrections officer “in dress and manner”, according to a court document. A prison officer in one of the guard towers opened a secure gate, allowing him to walk out of the facility. Rand Champion, a spokesperson for the state prison system, said that someone should have checked Hardin’s identity before he was allowed to leave, describing the lack of verification as a “lapse” that’s being investigated. Searchers had been using bloodhounds, officers on horseback, drones and helicopters in their hunt for Hardin since he escaped on 25 May. An elite and highly trained US border patrol team had recently joined the search, federal authorities announced this week. The border patrol tactical team known as BORTAC provided “advanced search capabilities and operational support” in the hunt for Hardin, US customs and border protection said. Its members are experienced in navigating complex terrain, the agency said. The Ozark mountains region is known for its rocky and rugged landscape, thick forests and an extensive cave network. Hardin pleaded guilty in 2017 to first-degree murder for the killing of James Appleton, 59. Appleton worked for the Gateway water department when he was shot in the head on 23 February 2017, near Garfield. Police found Appleton’s body inside a car. Hardin was sentenced to 30 years in prison. Hardin’s DNA was also matched to the 1997 rape of a teacher at an elementary school in Rogers, north of Fayetteville. He was sentenced to 50 years for that crime.",

    "title": "Why are ice cream prices soaring this summer?",
    "article_text": "Staying cool just got a little more expensive this summer. The price of coconut oil, a key ingredient in ice cream, has soared in 2025. Looking ahead, further price gains are likely as demand continues to outpace supply. At the end of May, the wholesale price for Philippine coconut oil delivered in Rotterdam, an industry benchmark, reached$2,800 a tonne, roughly twice as much as the year before. Adverse weather in Indonesia and the Philippines, which together account for three-quarters of global coconut oil supplies, has negatively affected production. Ice cream prices, in turn, have risen. According to an analysis by RIFT, a British business consultancy, United Kingdom supermarket ice lollies and cones shot up by 7.6 percent in May. Due to its high melting point, coconut oil keeps industrially made ice cream solid for longer at room temperature. Crucially for food companies, it does so without affecting ice cream’s flavour and texture. The global ice cream industry, worth$81bnin 2024, is now paying close attention to the market dynamics affecting coconut prices. Coconuts are found in the tropics, where they benefit from lots of rain and sunshine. But the El Nino weather pattern, which produces warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures across the Pacific, led to drier weather across Southeast Asia, particularly from June last year to October. During that period, coconut farms suffered from extreme heat and droughts. Because coconuts take a year to grow, last year’s weather pattern has meant that palm trees have yielded less fruit than normal in 2025, reducing supply. The United States Department of Agriculture expects that unfavourable weather conditions will seeglobal coconut oil production fall to 3.6 million tonnes in 2024-2025, down 5 to 10 percent from the previous season. Output is also likely to stay low in the 2025-2026 season, according to analysts. In October, the Philippine government mandatedblending larger amounts of coco methyl ester, a fatty derivative of coconut oil, with diesel to produce biodiesel. Until recently, the impact of the coconut-for-diesel policy was limited. A blending target of 1 percent was introduced in 2007 and then 2 percent from 2009. But that changed last year, when Manila hiked the target to 3 percent. The government announced a further jump to 4 percent by late 2025 and 5 percent by the end of 2026. A 1-percentage-point increase requires an extra 900 million coconuts for the biofuels market, raising demand and prices. Last year, Philippine Energy Secretary Raphael Lotilla said: “Implementing the higher biofuels blend is a win-win solution as we promote economic growth, uphold environmental stewardship and strive for cleaner energy utilisation.” If the Philippine government carries out its plan, it will use 4.5 billion coconuts to generate the 500 million litres of coco methyl ester necessary to meet the biodiesel target by 2026. That would amount to nearly one-third of the country’s annual crop of 15 billion coconuts. For context, the US diverts about 40 percent of its annual corn crop into its bioethanol, a fuel made primarily from fermented cornstarch designed to lower greenhouse gas emissions. In an effort to maintain profit margins and contain costs, increasing numbers of chocolate makers have started reformulating products with cocoa substitutes. One of those is coconut oil. In December, the US ICE cocoa futures contract surged to a record $12,931 per tonne, up a staggering 177 percent from the same period the year before. Since then, prices have come down but continue to remain elevated. The high price of cocoa – currently trending about $10,000 per tonne – continues to be supported by crop shortages and resilient consumer demand for cocoa-based products, especially chocolate. Coconut oil is an established alternative for cocoa butter, particularly in vegan or dairy-free chocolate recipes. And even at its elevated price, coconut oil is still cheaper than cocoa. “I expect many confectionery and chocolate makers to substitute cocoa for coconut oil in the near term,” Felipe Pohlmann Gonzaga, a Switzerland-based commodity trader, told Al Jazeera. Platforms like TikTok and Instagram have become another source of demand. In recent years, coconuts have been extolled by celebrities likeGwyneth PaltrowandKourtney Kardashianfor their nutritional benefits. Wellness Mama, a popular healthcare website, lists101 usesfor coconuts, including as a treatment for insomnia, heartburn, cuts, acne, haemorrhoids, mosquito bites and sunburn. In the makeup and beauty market, coconut oil is seen as a natural and environmentally friendly alternative to palm oil. Here too, industrial consumption is rising. While the health benefits of coconut oil continue to bequestioned, this niche source of demand is rising. And although they wouldn’t have a big impact on their own, health-conscious buyers are entering an already tight market, lifting prices. Despite coconut oil’s growing popularity, expanding production is a difficult task. “Unlike with other crops,coconut farmerscan’t simply add acres in response to higher prices,” Pohlmann Gonzaga says. “It takes at least a year for the trees to reach maturity and production. Deforestation concerns and environmental laws also make expansion difficult,” he added. Like palm fruit, coconuts grow on trees in tropical areas where forests would have to be removed to plant more trees. “The European Union deforestation regulation, for instance, inhibits the destruction of biodiverse forests in order to importmonoculture crops,” Pohlmann Gonzaga said. He also pointed out that “we’re moving from El Nino to La Nina, which tends to bring more flooding in Southeast Asia. So planting, harvests and logistics will be impacted.” With demand for coconuts likely to remain firm and supplies constrained, he added that he does not expect the prices to come down anytime soon. “We can expect ice cream prices to be high this summer and stay high next year,” he said. “For ice cream lovers out there, it may be time to start looking at fruit-based sorbet substitutes.”",

    "title": "Israel warns of more attacks on Lebanon if Hezbollah not disarmed",
    "article_text": "The Israeli military will continue to bomb Lebanon if Hezbollah is not disarmed, Israel’s Defence Minister Israel Katz has warned, saying “there will be no calm in Beirut” and “no order or stability in Lebanon” unless Israel’s security is assured. “Agreements must be honoured, and if you do not do what is required, we will continue to act, and with great force,” the Israeli minister said in a Friday statement. Israel’s military launched aseries of strikestargeting Beirut’s southern suburbs on Thursday night, sending huge numbers of residents fleeing their homes on the eve of the Muslim Eid al-Adha holiday after issuing a forced evacuation order an hour earlier. Israel claimed, without providing evidence, that its latest attack was launched against Hezbollah “drone factories” in the Lebanese capital. The Israeli military said Hezbollah was “operating to increase production of UAVs [drones] for the next war” with Israel in “blatant violation” of the terms of November’s ceasefire. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency reported that Israeli fighter jets had carried out about a dozen strikes in the attack. A Hezbollah statement said a preliminary assessment showed nine buildings had been destroyed, while dozens of others were damaged. Hezbollah also denied there were drone production facilities in the targeted locations. The Israeli attack was the fourth, and heaviest, carried out targeting Beirut’s southern suburbs – a Hezbollah stronghold – since the ceasefire ended hostilities on November 27. Israel’s last attack on the Lebanese capital, in which it claimed to destroy “infrastructure where precision missiles” were being stored by Hezbollah,came in late April. Across Lebanon, Israel has violated the ceasefire on a near-daily basis in the seven months since it was signed, according to the Lebanese government of President Joseph Aoun, Arab nations and human rights groups. Aoun has appealed to the United States and France, guarantors of the November ceasefire, to rein in Israel’s attacks. Speaking late on Thursday, Aoun voiced “firm condemnation of the Israeli aggression”, labelling the attacks a “flagrant violation of an international accord … on the eve of a sacred religious festival”. On Friday, Ali Ammar, a Hezbollah lawmaker, urged “all Lebanese political forces … to translate their statements of condemnation into concrete action”, including diplomatic pressure. In the months since the ceasefire, Israeli strikes in Lebanon have killed at least 190 people and wounded nearly 500 more, the Lebanese government said in April. Under the ceasefire agreement, the Lebanese military has been tasked with disarming Hezbollah – a political party and paramilitary group once believed to be more heavily armed than the state. But following Thursday’s attack, Lebanon’s army warned that such attacks are weakening its role in the ceasefire. It added that Israel rejected its proposal to inspect the alleged drone production sites in southern Beirut in order to prevent an air strike. “The Israeli enemy violations of the deal and its refusal to respond to the committee is weakening the role of the committee and the army,” the military said in a statement. It added that continued Israeli attacks could lead the army to freeze its cooperation with the monitoring committee “when it comes to searching posts” and dismantling Hezbollah infrastructure near the Israeli border in southern Lebanon. The war between Israel and Hezbollah re-erupted in the wake of Israel’s war on Gaza in October 2023, as the Lebanese group launched cross-border attacks on northern Israel in solidarity with Hamas. Subsequent Israeli attacks on Lebanon killed more than 4,000 people, including hundreds of civilians, before the ceasefire was signed. Hezbollah rocket fire in Israel killed a reported 87 Israeli military personnel and 46 civilians.",

    "title": "‘We do this to survive’: Harvesting opium poppies in Myanmar’s Shan State",
    "article_text": "Southern Shan State, Myanmar– Tian Win Nang squats on the hard-packed earth, balancing a kilogramme (2.2 pounds) of chocolate-coloured raw opium in each hand like a human weighing scales. “Each kilogramme is worth around $250,” said Tian Win Nang, wearing worn white flip-flops and a black T-shirt. The son of poppy farmers, Tian Win Nang appears to be barely out of his teens. “Chinese traders pay us in advance for the harvest,” he said, showing Al Jazeera three dinner-plate-sized mounds of opium. “We don’t know what happens after,” he says of the journey that will see the opium go “north to the labs” where it will be processed into morphine and eventually refined into heroin. “We do this to survive,” he adds. The sun is high and the air is still in the poppy fields blanketing the hills in this part of southern Shan State in eastern Myanmar. Men and women, young and old, their faces shielded with scarves and straw hats, move with quick, practised motions as hands use sharp tools to score green poppy pods before silently progressing on to another plant. A milky fluid slowly oozes from the wound inflicted on the pod. When it has dried to the consistency of gum, the same hands will scrape off the sticky substance, gather it together and leave it to dry in the sun until it reaches the toffee-like consistency of raw opium. This is a daily ritual for many farmers in this part of Shan State near where drug shipments have flowed along these mountain roads near the town of Pekon for decades. The routes wind towards the borders with neighbouring Thailand, Laos and China. Armed conflict between Myanmar’s military and ethnic armed organisations in these regions has fuelled opium farming and drug production for generations, but the trade has surged in step with the country’s intensifying civil war. Alliances have long existed, experts say, between high-ranking Myanmar military officers, ethnic armed groups, local criminal networks and transnational syndicates that handle the drug trade’s logistics, refining and distribution. “Drug trafficking in Myanmar has been facilitated by the military since the 1990s,” said Mark Farmaner, director of the London-based Advance Myanmar charity and an expert on Southeast Asia. “Many officers profit personally, and the institution as a whole reaps political advantages,” he said. One of the most powerful regional syndicates is Sam Gor, a sprawling network made up of an alliance of rival Chinese triad gangs that operates across China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and beyond. Despite the 2021 arrest and extradition to Australia of Tse Chi Lop – a Canadian national of Chinese origin widely believed to be the leader of Sam Gor – the network remains largely intact. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimates that the Sam Gor syndicate generated at least $8bn – and possibly as much as $17.7bn – in 2018 from controlling between 40 and 70 percent of the wholesale methamphetamine market in the Asia Pacific region. Despite the high-profile arrest of Tse Chi Lop, the regional drug trade is flourishing with more than 1.1 billion methamphetamine pills seized across Southeast Asia in 2023 – a historic record, according to UNODC. Most of the methamphetamine originates from laboratories hidden in the mountains of northern Shan State and other areas on Myanmar’s eastern borders, which have become the region’s epicentre of synthetic drug production and are part of the “Golden Triangle” – the lawless territory encompassing the shared borders of Myanmar, Thailand and Laos. But before the explosion in methamphetamine production, the Golden Triangle was infamous for its opium crops and the heroin it produced while under the rule of the self-styled drug lord Khun Sa – the undisputed drug kingpin of the 1980s and 1990s regional drug trade. Khun Sa is believed to have commanded a personal army of some 15,000 men and under his direction much of Shan State became the global centre of heroin production. He surrendered to the military government in Myanmar in 1996 and died in Yangon in 2007, under the protection of the same generals who had shielded him for years. “In the early 1980s, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration estimated that 70 percent of the heroin consumed in the US came from his organization ,” Kelvin Rowley, a lecturer at Swinburne University of Technology in Australia, wrote after Khun Sa’s death. “The US government placed a $2 million bounty on [Khun Sa’s] head – an amount reportedly less than what he earned in a single month,” Rowley said. Opium has now made a comeback in the Golden Triangle. After the Taliban banned poppy cultivation in Afghanistan in 2022, Myanmar returned to being the world’s top producer of opium. In 2023, according to UNODC estimates, Myanmar’s poppy fields stretched over more than 47,000 hectares (more than 116,000 acres), and by 2024, some 995 tonnes of raw opium was produced – an increase of 135 percent since the military takeover in 2021. The gross value of the opium and heroin trade in Myanmar last year was estimated to be between $589m and $1.57bn, according to UNODC. The scale of drug production, the UN reports, is also tied to the civil war in Myanmar, which is now in its fourth year. Myanmar’s economy has collapsed since the military coup in 2021, and with options narrowing, people have traditionally turned to poppy cultivation as a means to survive. The UN notes that opium poppy cultivation in Southeast Asia has long been linked to poverty, lack of government services, economic challenges and insecurity. “Households and villages in Myanmar that engage in poppy cultivation and the broader opium economy do so to supplement income or because they lack other legitimate opportunities,” the UN said.</p >< p> But now parts of Pekon, long a military stronghold and a key drug trafficking corridor, are under the control of the Karenni Nationalities Defence Force (KNDF) and other Karenni armed groups fighting the ruling military. They say they want to change things. “We oppose the production, trafficking, and use of narcotics,” said Maui, a deputy commander of the KNDF. “When we capture Burmese soldiers, they’re full of meth,” Maui said. “We ask where it comes from and they tell us, without hesitation, it’s distributed by their superiors to push them to the front lines,” he said. “Once the war is over, we’ll go after the opium too. We want it to be used only for medical purposes,” he added. As part of those antidrug efforts, Karenni police forces stop and search motorcycles and vehicles on roads in the areas of Shan State they now control. “We are stopping cars and motorbikes we don’t recognise to search for drugs,” said Karenni police commander Win Ning Thun, standing at a checkpoint just outside a village in Pekon district. “We’re looking for yaba pills,” said Win Ning Thun, using the local name for methamphetamine pills. “Until recently, this area was under military and pro-junta militia control,” Win Ning Thun said. “Meth was moving freely under their supervision. They took a percentage of the profits from every shipment passing through,” he said. Deep in the forests surrounding Pekon, a small prison holds rows of detainees arrested by Karenni police. “Everyone here has been arrested for drug trafficking. Some were carrying yaba pills to the Thai border. Others were internal couriers,” a Karenni police official told Al Jazeera. “These are the pills we confiscated just this past month,” he said, holding up a plastic bag stuffed with small red yaba pills that are easy to conceal, sold cheaply, but represent a trade that is worth millions of dollars. Among the detainees in the prison was Anton Lee, who wore glasses and a calm, unassuming look. “They stopped me at a checkpoint with 10,000 pills,” Lee said. “I was taking them to the Thai border. I was supposed to make a lot of money,” he said, offering no further details, only to say that the profit he hoped to earn would have fed his family for a year. Now, he faces a long time in prison. Not too far from the prison, the civil war grinds on in Myanmar as the military regime buys more advanced weaponry, and the rebel forces try to hold out and extend their advances. The military’s air raids, drone strikes and artillery fire hammer schools, hospitals, homes and religious sites, turning entire villages into targets. Yet, even under fire, here in southern Shan State, some appear to be trying to staunch the flow of drugs. With limited resources, they tell of doing what they can in another battle inside a much larger war.",

    "title": "Popular AI apps get caught in the crosshairs of Anthropic and OpenAI",
    "article_text": "﻿With the latest moves from both companies, life is getting increasingly treacherous for AI startups. ﻿With the latest moves from both companies, life is getting increasingly treacherous for AI startups. byAlex Heath Battlelines are being drawn between the major AI labs and the popular applications that rely on them. This week, both Anthropic and OpenAI took shots at two leading AI apps: Windsurf, one of the most popular vibe coding tools, and Granola, a buzzy AI app for taking meeting notes. ”With less than five days of notice, Anthropic decided to cut off nearly all of our first-party capacity to all Claude 3.x models,” Windsurf CEOVarun Mohanwrote on Xthis week, noting that “we wanted to pay them for the full capacity.” An additionalstatement on Windsurf’s websitesaid: “We are concerned that Anthropic’s conduct will harm many in the industry, not just Windsurf.” Here, Mohan’s company is collateral damage in Anthropic’s rivalry with OpenAI, which has reportedly been in talks to acquire Windsurf for about $3 billion. The deal hasn’t been confirmed, but even the spectre of it happening was enough for Anthropic to cut off one of the most popular apps that it powers. After a spokespersontoldTechCrunch’sMaxwell Zeffthat Anthropic was “prioritizing capacity for sustainable partnerships,” co-founderJared Kaplanput it more bluntly. “We really are just trying to enable our customers who are going to sustainably be working with us in the future,” Kaplantold Zeff. “I think it would be odd for us to be selling Claude to OpenAI.” Meanwhile, OpenAI sent its own warning shot this week to the budding AI app ecosystem. It announceda “record mode”for ChatGPT — initially only for enterprise accounts — that transcribes calls and generates meeting notes. This is the core use case of Granola, one of my favorite AI tools thatrecently raised $43 millionin additional funding and released a mobile app. Given how quickly Granola has evolvedto do morethan summarize meetings, I suspect that the company isn’t at risk of extinction. Still, it will be harder to grow when hundreds of millions of ChatGPT users eventually have access to its main functionality. It’s unclear how the tension between the product ambitions of OpenAI and Anthropic and the needs of their API customers will settle out. When I interviewed Anthropic’s chief product officer,Mike Krieger,back in March, the company had just announced its own Claude coding competitor to Windsurf and Cursor, which coincidentallyraised $900 millionthis week. I asked Krieger the obvious question: how does Anthropic think about competing with its API customers? He didn’t really have an answer. “I think this is a really delicate question for all of the labs and one that I’m trying to approach really thoughtfully,” Krieger told me at the time. “Hopefully, we’ll all be able to navigate the occasionally closer adjacencies.” AI investorZak Kukoffput itwell this week: “At some point model providers are going to need to decide if they want to be stable platforms or compete for every vertical.” Ultimately, this week served as a wake-up call for the many startups building businesses on the backs of AI models; if you are successful enough, you run the risk of being copied by your model provider. A lot of companies are thinking through this risk right now, especially as OpenAIbuilds a new teamto help its API customers “translate abstract ideas into production applications.” “You have to wonder if the recent moves by the big AI labs to more directly compete with the app layer will be one giant tailwind for incumbents like Google, Amazon, MSFT, etc.,”Michael Mignano, a Granola board member,wrote this week. “If developers can’t trust the labs, maybe it’s better to trust the big guys like they did for cloud?” This week, I heard two CEOs contradict thegrowing fearthat AI will destroy jobs en masse, at least when it comes to engineering roles. The first wasSundar Pichai, whom I watched speak at Bloomberg’s tech conference in San Francisco. He downplayedDario Amodei’sdoomerism fear about job loss, correctly pointing out that “we’ve made predictions like that for the last 20 years about technology and automation, and it hasn’t quite played out that way.” He went so far as to say, “I expect we will grow from our current engineering base into next year,” because AI “allows us to do more.” The next day, I walked down the street to the Moscone Center to see Snowflake CEOSridhar Ramaswamy, who had just spoken to a room of 4,000 developers with AI pioneerAndrew Ng. I asked Ramaswamy if AI had changed his hiring plans, and he said he agreed with a ranking of hiring desirability for engineers that Ng had just described onstage, with the top being experienced engineers who leverage AI tools, followed by early-career engineers who are all-in on AI. He noted that new graduates who avoid AI tools are at the bottom of the desirability ranking and may struggle to find jobs. If anything, it’s the middle of the workforce — those who are in the middle of their careers and hesitant to adopt AI tools — that is the most in danger of near-term displacement, Ramaswamy argued. “Companies tend to accrete middle management, so there’s very much a push to get more people who aredoing. How do we get them as leveraged as possible? Snowflake has historically been a little top-heavy on the engineering side, so we are balancing that out.” “Oh, man, the girls are fighting, aren’t they?” - Rep.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezcommenting onwhat was the best day on Twitter in years. “Maybe there’s a world where you have one AI in the sky. Maybe you actually have a bunch of domain-specific agents that require a bunch of specific work to make it happen. I think the evidence has really been shifting towards this menagerie of different models.” - OpenAI’sGreg Brockmanspeaking atthe AI Engineer’s World Fair. “Give it a year. We’ll be doing a billion queries a week if we can sustain this growth rate.” - Perplexity CEOAravind Srinivasonstageat Bloomberg’s tech conference. “We were accidentally cash flow positive in Q1, which was cool.” - Substack CEOChris Bestspeaking atThe Information’s creator economy summit.

The Nintendo Switch 2 is more expensive in practically every way: pricier console, pricier games, an entire Chat buttonyou’ll eventually have to pay to use. So it was nice when Nintendo revealed youwon’tneed itsown $55 camerato video chat with pals. “You can use the Nintendo Switch 2 camera accessory (sold separately) or any compatible USB-C® camera you’d like,”the company wrote. But you might be mighty disappointed if you simply buy a PC webcam off the shelf. Many USB-C webcams we’ve tried don’t work at all, including the ones you’ll typically find on “best webcam” lists around the internet, like the Logitech Brio 4K, the Insta360 Link, and the Elgato Facecam MK.2. Meanwhile, ancient USB-A cameras like my Logitech C920 fire up instantly with no trouble at all. And in our testing, it doesn’t seem to matter if you use the Switch USB-C ports or the USB-A ports on the dock, whether you’re going through a C-to-A adapter, or whether you daisy-chain with a USB hub: the webcams that work, work, and the ones that don’t, don’t. Overall, it’s starting to look like Nintendo didn’t mean “compatible with USB-C,” but rather “compatible with Switch 2.” So why did it suggest you can use any camera you’d like? We’ve asked Nintendo. (It didn’t have an answer for us just yet.) As of launch, neither Nintendo nor any major webcam manufacturer had even a partial list for us of compatible webcams. We asked Logitech, Razer, Microsoft, Anker, Elgato, Dell, Insta360, Obsbot, and Opal, but they didn’t have anything yet. (We’ll publish an update and/or a new story next week if they do.) In the meanwhile, it may be up to gamers and the media to create a list themselves. So here’s a first stab at that!

    "title": "Protests held after dozens arrested in immigration operations across L.A.",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 7, 2025 / 12:36 AM EDT/ KCAL News Dozens of people were arrested Friday in multiple immigration enforcement operations involving Homeland Security Investigations, the DEA and the FBI that took place across Los Angeles. The arrests prompted citywide protests. The raids occurred in the Westlake District, downtown L.A., and South L.A., CBS News Los Angeles learned. Yasmeen Pitts O'Keefe, a spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told CBS News Los Angeles in a statement that about 44 people were arrested in the operations. \"ICE officers and agents alongside partner law enforcement agencies, executed four federal search warrants at three locations in central Los Angeles,\" O'Keefe said. \"Approximately 44 people were administratively arrested and one arrest for obstruction. The investigation remains ongoing, updates will follow as appropriate.\" The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, or CHIRLA, a nonprofit immigrant rights advocacy group, also estimated that at least 45 people had been taken into custody. And in a previous statement, O'Keefe said federal agents were executing search warrants in downtown L.A.  related to the \"harboring of people illegally in the country.\" Witness video and SKYCal aerial footage showed federal agents detaining people outside a Home Depot in the Westlake District, as well as outside a business in downtown LA. During one of Friday's operations, Service Employees International Union-United Service Workers West says its president, David Huerta, was taken into custody. In a press release, the union said that he was injured during the arrest and treated at Los Angeles General Hospital before being discharged and taken to the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown LA. \"What happened to me is not about me; This is about something much bigger. This is about how we as a community stand together and resist the injustice that's happening. Hard-working people, and members of our family and our community, are being treated like criminals,\" Huerta said in a statement afterwards. \"We all collectively have to object to this madness because this is not justice. This is injustice. And we all have to stand on the right side of justice.\" U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli addressed Huerta's arrest in apost on X. \"Federal agents were executing a lawful judicial warrant at a LA worksite this morning when David Huerta deliberately obstructed their access by blocking their vehicle. He was arrested for interfering with federal officers and will face arraignment in federal court on Monday,\" the post said. Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said the department was aware that ICE was conducting operations in the city, but that it is not involved and will not assist in any sort of mass deportations. \"I'm aware that these actions cause anxiety for many Angelenos, so I want to make it clear: the LAPD is not involved in civil immigration enforcement,\" McDonnell said. Sheriff Robert Luna echoed the sentiment, stating that the LA County Sheriff's Department does not enforce civil immigration law  and that their goal is \"enforcing state and local laws to ensure safety and well-being of our diverse communities throughout Los Angeles County.\" SKYCal footage over downtown LA shows both FBI and HSI agents responding as at least two people were detained outside Ambiance Apparel on Towne Avenue. A crowd of people and some protesters gathered outside the location as the alleged operation was being carried out. A third immigration operation also unfolded at a second Ambiance building in South L.A. near 15th Street and Santa Fe Avenue. The FBI, in a separate statement, said it was supporting the Department of Homeland Security in immigration operations all across the country. \"As we have been asked to do, we are sending Agents to participate in these immigration enforcement efforts. That includes assisting in cities where major operations are already underway and where we have special agents embedded on operational teams with DHS,\" the FBI said. CBS News Los Angeles has reached out to Ambiance for comment and is waiting for a response. Later in the day, protesters marched through the streets of downtown Los Angeles, stopping for a while on Aliso Street near the 101 Freeway. They could be seen waving flags and holding signs criticizing ICE. Some demonstrators were seen spraying graffiti onto the side of the Metropolitan Detention Center. The crowd continued to move throughout the night, prompting the LAPD todeclare it an \"unlawful assembly\"and issue a dispersal order. Officers dressed in riot gear began to move towards the crowd in a skirmish line as the demonstrators threw projectiles in their direction.Police saidthey were throwing \"large pieces of concrete.\" CBS News Los Angeles reporters witnessed officers firing non-lethal foam projectiles and bean bag rounds in response. At around 8 p.m., the crowd started to thin with LAPD officers blocking their path to the detention center. Traffic in the area was also impacted as both police and demonstrators crowded the streets near the 101 Freeway. In a statement shared Friday to social media, L.A. Mayor Karen Bass said that city officials Friday morning \"received reports of federal immigration enforcement actions in multiple locations in Los Angeles. As Mayor of a proud city of immigrants, who contribute to our city in so many ways, I am deeply angered by what has taken place. These tactics sow terror in our communities and disrupt basic principles of safety in our city. My Office is in close coordination with immigrant rights community organization. We will not stand for this.\" Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California also condemned the operations in a statement, saying that \"the ICE raids across Los Angeles today are a continuation of a disturbing pattern of extreme and cruel immigration enforcement operations across the country. These indiscriminate raids prove once again that the Trump administration cares about nothing but instilling harm and fear in our communities to drive immigrants into the shadows. It will not work.\" Meanwhile, community leaders and activists converged in downtown L.A. on Friday afternoon for a press conference on the operations. \"Our community is under attack and is being terrorized. These are workers, these are fathers, these are mothers, and this has to stop. Immigration enforcement that is terrorizing our families throughout this country and picking up our people that we love must stop now,\" said Angelica Salas, executive director of CHIRLA. Earlier Friday,CBS News learnedthat some allegedly undocumented immigrants were being taken into custody and brought to the basement of the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building in Los Angeles during ICE check-ins. Some of these people were held overnight, immigration lawyers and family members said. Legal representatives said that detainees were being kept in rooms with no beds or blankets and that they had limited access to food and water. Julie Sharp is a digital producer at CBS Los Angeles.

    "title": "Maryland leaders react as Kilmar Abrego Garcia returns to U.S. to face charges",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 6, 2025 / 11:29 PM EDT/ CBS Baltimore Maryland leaders shared their thoughts after news that Kilmar Abrego Garcia has returned to the U.S. to face federal charges, nearly four months after he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Abrego Garcia illegally entered the U.S. in 2011 and settled in Maryland. He was taken into custody by federal immigration officials on March 13 of this year and was among nearly 230 people deported to a Salvadoran prison on March 15. An indictment unsealed Friday shows that Abrego Garcia isfacing two federal charges. The charges, filed in a federal district court in Nashville, Tennessee, accuse Abrego Garcia of conspiracy to transport aliens and unlawfully transporting undocumented people, according to CBS News. According to the indictment, a grand jury found that Abrego Garcia had a role in an alien smuggling ring that involved children and women over the last decade. If convicted, Abrego Garcia would be imprisoned in the U.S. before he is returned to El Salvador. Abrego Garcia's case drew attention from leaders and advocates across the nation, including Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen and Congressman Glenn Ivey. Both Van Hollen and Ivey traveled to El Salvador to meet with Abrego Garcia, thoughIvey was denied access. Both leaders have called for Abrego Garcia's return and have called out the Trump administration for denying due process in the case. \"For months, the Trump Administration flouted the Supreme Court and our Constitution,\" Van Hollen said in a statement Friday. \"Today, they appear to have finally relented to our demands for compliance with court orders and with the due process rights afforded to everyone in the United States. As I have repeatedly said, this is not about the man, it's about his constitutional rights – and the rights of all. The Administration will now have to make its case in the court of law, as it should have all along.\" Van Hollen has been a vocal supporter of Abrego Garcia's right to due process, going so far as topen a letter to President Trump. \"Your comments and the actions of your Administration clearly demonstrate your failure to comply with court orders as you continue to violate Mr. Abrego Garcia's constitutional and due process rights,\" Van Hollen wrote to the president in April. \"At least he's going to have a chance to talk to his lawyers now and hopefully have a chance to start appearing in front of judges here in the United States and get some semblance of due process,\" Rep. Glen Ivey said. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks emphasized Friday that Abrego Garcia should not have been deported. \"Even the Supreme Court demanded this President follow the law and return him to the U.S. It is right that due process will be afforded to him,\"she said in a social post. \"I've reached out to his family, we have not yet been connected, I hope to do that soon,\" Van Hollen added. \"We've also been in touch with his lawyers because he had been denied the chance to talk to his lawyers ever since.\" During a press conference on Friday, Ama Frimpong, the legal director of CASA, stated that \" for three months these three children and Kilmar's wife have been wondering when will their loved one come back home... As the fight for Kilmar continues for justice, which means his actual release, resume communication. Let him talk to his wife. Let him talk to his children. This family has suffered enough.\" Abrego Garcia sued the Trump administration over his deportation to El Salvador, saying a withholding of removal order granted to him in 2019 should have prevented the action. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) admitted that Abergo Garcia was deported due to an \"administrative error\" and \"oversight.\" In April, afederal judge and the Supreme Courtordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return to the U.S.  The Supreme Court then sent the case back to federal court. In early May, the administration was accused of stonewalling court orders afterinvoking the state secrets privilege, which allows them to withhold information. Abrego Garcia remained in custody as his case played out. He was moved from the notorious CECOT prisonto a lower-security facilityin mid-April, days before he met with Sen. Van Hollen. In a procedural move, the Trump administration asked a federal judge todismiss Abrego Garcia's lawsuiton May 28. As Abrego Garcia's case played out in court, the Trump administration continued to allege he was a member of the MS-13 gang. Those allegations stemmed from his arrest in 2019, during which law enforcement reported that Abrego Garcia was wearing a Chicago Bulls hat and a hoodie that were \"indicative of Hispanic gang culture.\" At that time, police were informed by a source that Abrego Garcia was an active member of MS-13, according to court documents. Abrego Garcia's attorneys have repeatedly denied the gang ties, saying he does not have a criminal history in the U.S. or in El Salvador. © 2025 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "title": "Trump Updates: Musk feud simmers, Abrego Garcia returned to U.S.",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 6, 2025 / 11:20 PM EDT/ CBS News Elon Musk wished President Trump well in apost on Xlate Friday, as a public blowup between the president and the world's richest man showed some signs of cooling off. When asked about Musk earlier Friday, Mr. Trump largely avoided taking swipes at the billionaire, telling reporters, \"I just wish him well.\" Hours later, Musk replied to a video of the president's comments: \"Likewise.\" Musk alsoresponded\"Fair enough\" to a video in which Mr. Trump said he will \"take a look at\" cutting off some of the government contracts that flow to Musk's companies in the name of fiscal responsibility. It's unclear if the mutual well-wishes mark a true détente between Musk and Mr. Trump, who feuded throughout the day Thursday. Mr. Trump told reporters earlier Friday he had no plans to speak with the Tesla CEO, while Musk hascontinued to museabout starting a new political party. President Trump told reporters Friday his administration will \"take a look at\" the large federal contracts and subsidies that Elon Musk's companies benefit from. On Thursday, Mr. Trump suggested cutting off subsidies to Musk's companies, escalating a public feud between the president and the world's richest man. Musk's two largest companies, SpaceX and Tesla, getbillions of dollarsfrom direct government grants and environmental incentives. When asked by a reporter Friday if he's still considering rolling back subsidies to Musk as a money-saving move, Mr. Trump suggested he was open to it. \"He's got a lot of money, he gets a lot of subsidy. So we'll take a look at that,\" the president said on Air Force One. \"Only if it's fair for him and for the country. I would certainly think about it, but it has to be fair.\" Mr. Trump said he doesn't have any immediate plans to speak with Musk. He remained complimentary of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, and largely demurred when asked about his view on Musk, saying he's focused on other matters: \"I just wish him well.\" The president alsodidn't comment about reportson Musk's alleged drug use, saying a New York Times article on the issue \"sounded very unfair.\" And he said he will not try to take back a symbolic key that was presented to Musk last week, marking the end of his time with the Trump administration: \"I don't take things back.\" The president was optimistic about the fate of the One, Big Beautiful Bill Act,a domestic policy billthat still needs to pass the Senate. Musk's opposition to the bill helped spark his feud with Mr. Trump. \"We have tremendous support,\" the president told reporters. Separately, Mr. Trump would not say whether it was his decisionto returnKilmar Abrego Garcia to the U.S. to face criminal charges, after he was imprisoned in El Salvador for months following his mistaken deportation. Mr. Trump said Abrego Garcia has a \"horrible past.\" Mr. Trump is looking at \"all options available\" as his latest executive order to delay enforcement of a law that essentially bans TikTok is set to expire on June 19, according to the White House. \"President Trump remains committed to securing a deal that saves TikTok while protecting the American people's data privacy. He is reviewing all options available and you will hear from the President once there is an announcement to be made,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement Friday. TheNew York PostandWall Street Journalreported that Mr. Trump is considering another delay as TikTok and its China-based parent company, ByteDance, have yet to cut ties. It would be the third time since January that Mr. Trump has ordered the Justice Department not to enforce the law, which bans TikTok in the U.S. unless ByteDance sells the company. The law passed Congress with bipartisan support last year, and was upheld by the Supreme Court days before Mr. Trump was inaugurated. BY Caitlin Yilek and Kristin Brown Elon Musk once again suggested creating a new political party to \"represent the 80% in the middle\" on Friday, an idea he floated a day earlier during an angry back-and-forth with President Trump. Musk had posted a poll to X on Thursday asking if people support creating a new political party. After just over 24 hours, some 80% of respondents voted yes, leading Musk to say, \"The people have spoken.\" In a reply, Musk suggested calling it the \"America Party.\" Read more here. The people have spoken. A new political party is needed in America to represent the 80% in the middle!And exactly 80% of people agree 😂This is fate.https://t.co/JkeOlG7Kl4 The president shared a post Friday afternoon rebuking Elon Musk's claims that he is \"in the Epstein files,\" breaking Mr. Trump's hours-long silence about his feud with Musk. Mr. Trumpshared a screenshotof an X post from attorney David Schoen that said Epstein \"had no information to hurt President Trump.\" Schoen — who oncerepresented Mr. Trumpin an impeachment trial — says he was hired to represent Epstein shortly before his death in custody for sex trafficking charges. Schoen's post didn't mention Musk by name, but it appeared to be a response to Musk's claim a day earlier that \"@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public.\" The post marked Mr. Trump's first comments on Truth Social about the Musk feud since Thursday, when the presidentrepeatedly lashedout at Musk and said he had \"gone CRAZY.\" Mr. Trump spoke with several reporters earlier Friday,tellingCBS News' chief Washington analyst Robert Costa he's focusing on domestic and foreign policy rather than Musk. A federal appeals court on Friday said the presidentcould barthe Associated Press from the Oval Office and other restricted spaces, blocking a judge's ruling that the White House's decision likely violated the First Amendment. The White House informed the AP in February that it would no longer be permitted in the Oval Office, Air Force One and other places where members of the White House press pool are allowed because of its refusal to use the name Gulf of America in its Stylebook and reporting. The wire service has continued to use the name Gulf of Mexico. \"We grant in part the government's motion for a stay pending appeal,\" the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia wrote in a 2-1 decision. \"The White House is likely to succeed on the merits because these restricted presidential spaces are not First Amendment fora opened for private speech and discussion,\" the decision said. \"The White House therefore retains discretion to determine, including on the basis of viewpoint, which journalists will be admitted. Moreover, without a stay, the government will suffer irreparable harm because the injunction impinges on the President's independence and control over his private workspaces.\" Read more here. An attorney for Kilmar Abrego Garcia called his return to the U.S. to face criminal charges Friday \"an abuse of power, not justice,\" after he spent months in Salvadoran prisons following his deportation from Maryland. Lawyer Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said the government \"disappeared Kilmar to a foreign prison in violation of a court order. Now, after months of delay and secrecy, they're bringing him back, not to correct their error but to prosecute him.\" Meanwhile, Maryland Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollensaid, \"this is not about the man, it's about his constitutional rights – and the rights of all. The Administration will now have to make its case in the court of law, as it should have all along.\" The Justice Department haschargedAbrego Garcia with one count of conspiracy to transport aliens and one count of unlawful transportation of undocumented aliens. Attorney General Pam Bondi alleged he \"played a significant role in an alien smuggling ring.\" The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency in a pair of cases Friday — as DOGE's former leader Elon Musk feuds with President Trump. The high courtallowed DOGE to accesssensitive information held by the Social Security Administration, lifting a lower court injunction that halted the group from accessing the agency's records amid legal challenges. The justices alsohalted a separate lower court orderthat required DOGE to hand over records about its work and personnel to a government watchdog group. The high court's three liberal justices dissented from both rulings. DOGE was previously led by Musk, but his time as a formal part of the Trump administration came to an end last week. Read more here. Kilmar Abrego Garcia — the Maryland man from El Salvador who had been deported and imprisoned there — has landed back in the U.S., Attorney General Pam Bondi announced in a press conference Friday afternoon, months after a judge ordered his return. Minutes earlier, federal criminal charges were unsealed against Abrego Garcia for transporting aliens. Bondi said that, if convicted, he will return to his home country after serving a sentence in the U.S. \"Abrego Garica has landed in the United States to face justice,\" Bondi announced, adding, \"this is what American justice looks like.\" Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador in March, in what the Trump administration acknowledged was an error. A judge ordered the Trump administration to \"facilitate\" the return of Abrego Garcia, who was deported even though a court had previously ruled he should not be sent to El Salvador. Read more here. By Melissa Quinn and Kathryn Watson The State Department told diplomatic posts to start refusing student and exchange visa applicants who plan to study at Harvard University \"effective immediately,\" in a message Friday signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and obtained by CBS News. Mr. Trump had ordered animmediate halton international students entering the U.S. to study at Harvard on Wednesday, with narrow exceptions for applicants whose entry would be \"in the national interest,\" escalating a simmering feud between Mr. Trump and the Ivy League school. A judge temporarily blocked that rule Thursday night after Harvard sued; it's unclear how that ruling impacts Friday's memo. Friday's message said visas that have already been issued but haven't left a foreign embassy or consulate yet should be cancelled, but action shouldn't be taken on visas that have already left. Any decisions about revoking visas for current students \"will be coordinated from Washington.\" A State Department spokesperson told CBS News it \"does not comment on internal communications, nor do we comment on pending litigation.\" Kilmar Abrego Garcia wascharged in U.S. federal courtin an indictment unsealed Friday. The indictment — filed in Nashville — charges Abrego Garcia with one count of conspiracy to transport aliens and one count of unlawful transportation of undocumented aliens. ABC News reported Friday that he was being brought back to the U.S. to face criminal charges. En route to New Jersey from the White House Friday, the president declined an opportunity to speak to reporters gathered on the White House South Lawn. The president would have faced questions about Musk, among other topics. Mr. Trump, who frequently gaggles with reporters, hasn't spoken to reporters at the White House other than individual calls with reporters since his public feud with Musk. FBI Director Kash Patel revealed during anepisodeof Joe Rogan's podcast, \"The Joe Rogan Experience,\" that he was the victim of swatting. \"As the director of the FBI, I have a responsibility — I'm not just going to bring a case because somebody hurt me. They did, and they continue to do it,\" Patel said. \"S**t, my house just got swatted yesterday.\" The episode with Patel was published Friday, though it's unclear when it was taped.According to KLAS, a swatting call was reported at Patel's Las Vegas home on Tuesday morning. The caller said there was an active crime being committed at the house. Police determined the call was a hoax before officers responded, according to KLAS. The president posted on Truth Social that trade talks between U.S. officials and their Chinese counterparts will take place on Monday in London. Mr. Trump said the U.S. would be represented by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. \"The meeting should go very well,\" hewrote. News of the meeting comes one day after Mr. Trumpspoke to Chinese President Xi Jinpingfor 90 minutes and said the two sides agreed to resume talks. The two countries had exchanged accusations that each was violating a May 12 truce in an escalating tariff battle, an agreement that was meant to pave the way for a broader trade deal. Despite the public feud between Mr. Trump and Musk, there has been no effort to oust the over 100 administration officials who came from Musk's orbit, according to three administration officials. Sources say the White House's Presidential Personnel Office, led by Sergio Gor, is not working to push these staffers and nominees out. Many are expected to be confirmed by the Senate in the next month. As of Friday afternoon, the White House has not received any official resignations from DOGE staffers since Thursday's public blowup between the president and Musk. Administration staffers supported by Musk include Troy Meink, who was confirmed recently by the Senate to be secretary of the Air Force. Stephen Ehikian, a former Salesforce vice president with ties to Musk, currently serves as the acting head of the General Services Administration. And sources say there is not an effort to pull the nomination of venture capitalist Scott Kupor to lead the Office of Personnel Management. One Musk-backed nominee who was pulled, days before Thursday's public breakup between Musk and Trump, wasJason Isaacman, who had been awaiting Senate confirmation to lead NASA. Sources said the withdrawal of Isaacman to lead NASA wasn't out of spite towards Musk. Mr. Trump announced he pulled Isaacman's nomination on May 31, ahead of the public spat with Musk. On Thursday, the president referenced Isaacman's donations to Democratic campaigns as a reason why his nomination was withdrawn. \"I say, you know, look, we won. We get certain privileges, and one of the privileges [is] we don't have to appoint a Democrat,\"' Mr. Trump said Thursday in an Oval Office meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. Republican senators had also called the White House to complain about Isaacman's Democratic donations and ask for his nomination to be pulled, sources say. In 2024, Isaacman donated to several Democrats, including Sens. Chuck Schumer, Jon Tester, Bob Casey and Mark Kelly. Campaign finance records show his last donation to a Republican was to Florida State Rep. Randy Fine's campaign in a February special election. There were no donations shown for Mr. Trump. Former White House aide Steve Bannon was among those critical of Isaacman's nomination. \"No progressive Democrats in the administration — start by checking donors,\" Bannon said. He declined to say if he hopes some of Musk's allies leave government after Thursday's spat. By Jennifer Jacobs and Aaron Navarro In a phone conversation Friday morning, President Trump told chief Washington analyst for CBS News Robert Costa that he's moving forward with his presidency today, and \"totally\" focused on domestic and foreign policy matters — not on Musk and their public feud. He also cast this moment as a positive oneeconomically, even as many of his supporters and critics are paying close attention to Musk's attacks on his administration. \"That's all I focus on,\" Mr. Trump said of his presidency. \"I don't focus on anything else. That's why I have my highest poll numbers.\" \"It's going really well,\" the president added. \"The country is doing great, has never done so well. Jobs numbers are great, everything is good.\" According to two sources close to the president who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations, the atmosphere at the White House this morning is muted about Musk. The president, they said, is unhappy with him. But the president also finds him to be \"immature\" and \"acting out,\" as one source described Mr. Trump's view of the situation. \"This is a fluid thing and a lot can happen. It's wait and see, wait and see what happens, what Musk does, how the president digests it,\" one of the sources said. \"We're all not going to get ahead of this and he's just doing what he always does, be the president and keep on moving.\" Musk took up posting on X again Friday, responding to Steve Bannon's criticism of him. The former chief White House strategist, who remains close to Mr. Trump, had suggested Musk, a naturalized citizen from South Africa, should be \"deported from the country immediately.\" \"Bannon is a criminal,\"Musk wrotein response to a video of Bannon suggesting the federal government should immediately seize SpaceX, one of Musk's companies. \"And a communist.\" Bannon served four months in prison for defying a congressional subpoena in the investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021,Capitol assault. Steve Bannon on Friday called on the Trump administration to investigate Elon Musk. Bannon, a former White House chief strategist and an ally of President Trump, told CBS News he wants the White House and Trump administration to probe alleged drug use by Musk, the South African-native's immigration status and the Musk-inspired Department of Government Efficiency. \"They have to do that. You have to take his security clearance. Investigate drug use and investigate his involvement\" with China, Bannon said in a phone interview. \"And you have to investigate his status as a citizen.\" Bannon questioned whether Musk's path to citizenship was handled properly. \"If it turned out he overstayed visas and lied about it, it's not right. It has to be investigated,\" Bannon said. He added that he now believes DOGE needs greater scrutiny. \"Did they take data sets to feed into their AI model? This has to be investigated now. He's an unstable individual. What did DOGE do? What did DOGE find?\" Bannon asked, saying it's a matter of \"national security.\" Read morehere. Tesla'sstock pricerose in early trading, regaining some of the ground it lost after anacrimonious online disputebetween Elon Musk, CEO of the electric car maker, and President Trump. Tesla sharesclosed down 14%on Thursday following the heated exchange, with Mr. Trump threatening to strip Musk's companies of their government contracts. The stock was up more than 5%, to around $300, as of 1 p.m. ET. Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives said the spat unnerved Tesla investors, he remained optimistic the stock would rebound. \"Musk needs Trump and Trump needs Musk for many reasons, and these two becoming friends again will be a huge relief for Tesla shares,\" he wrote in a research note Friday. President Trump's administration asked the Supreme Court on Friday to clear the way for it to continue with its efforts todismantle the Department of Educationand lay off more than 1,300 employees while a legal fight over the future of the department moves forward. The Justice Department is seeking the high court's intervention in a pair of disputes brought by a group of20 states,school districts and teachers unions, which challenge Mr. Trump's plans to unwind the Department of Education. The presidentsigned an executive orderin March directing Education Secretary Linda McMahon to facilitate the department's closure to the maximum extent allowed under the law. As part of Mr. Trump's pledge to get rid of the department, the administration canceled a host of grants and executed a reduction in force, or a layoff, that impacted 1,378 employees — roughly a third of the department'sworkforce. Affected workers were placed on administrative leave and were to receive full pay and benefits until June 9. Mr. Trump also announced that the Small Business Administration would take over the Education Department's student-loan portfolio, and the Department of Health and Human Services would handle special education, nutrition and other related services. In response to the lawsuits challenging Mr. Trump's actions, a federal judge in Massachusetts blocked the administration from carrying out its layoffs, finding that the reduction-in-force was a unilateral effort to close the department, which would violate the separation of powers. Read morehere. House Speaker Mike Johnson said Friday morning he hopes Mr. Trump and Musk \"reconcile\" but warned against challenging the president of the United States. Johnson told reporters he hasn't spoken with Musk by phone and said he has only communicated with him by text since Thursday's public fallout between Mr. Trump and Musk. The speaker said he was at the White House with the president Thursday \"as some of this was unfolding\" and described the president as \"disappointed\" by what Musk said. But Johnson said he hopes the two men can reconcile. \"I believe in redemption,\" Johnson said. \"That's part of my worldview, and I think it's good for the party and the country if all that's worked out.\" \"I tell you what, do not doubt and do not second-guess and don't ever challenge the president of the United States, Donald Trump,\" Johnson added. \"He is the leader of the party. He's the most consequential political figure of this generation and probably the modern era, and he's doing an excellent job for the people.\" A senior administration official said Mr. Trump is thinking about selling the Tesla he purchased earlier this year. In March, the president said that he would buy a Tesla \"as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk.\" Several models of the vehicle were displayed on the driveway at the White House for Mr. Trump to shop from and he ultimately selected a red Model S, which starts at around $80,000. Mr. Trump told reporters then that he would write a check for the car and leave it at the White House for hisstaff to use. On the heels of their public spat, Musk is seeking a call with Mr. Trump. A call hasn't taken place, a source familiar with the discussions told CBS News. The source said Mr. Trump hasn't elected to schedule a call with Musk. A second source told CBS News that the president isn't interested in speaking with Musk. In an appearance on CNN, White House Office and Management Director Russ Vought said of Musk's comments lambasting the Trump tax bill, \"We're disappointed by Elon's comments, but look, we have a job to do. The president has a job to do.\" As to whether the cancellation of Musk'sgovernment subsidies and contractsis actually under consideration, a threat Mr. Trump made Thursday, Vought did not answer directly — he said Musk and his companies, which include Tesla, SpaceX and Starlink, benefit from taxpayer dollars. The president posted onTruth Socialthat the \"easiest\" way to save \"billions and billions\" in the budget \"is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts.\" Vought argued the president's post was intended to state \"the reality that the businesses of Elon Musk benefit and work in tandem with the federal government. And the American people need to know that.\" Vought also acknowledged that the tax bill, titled One Big Beautiful Bill, could be changed by the Senate and that the White House is having conversations with House and Senate members to make \"improvements\" to it. The May jobs report showed 139,000 jobs were added in the last month. President Trump reacted favorably to the news, posting on Truth Social, \"AMERICA IS HOT! SIX MONTHS AGO IT WAS COLD AS ICE! BORDER IS CLOSED, PRICES ARE DOWN. WAGES ARE UP!\" In another post, he criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, urging him to slash interest rates. CBS News MoneyWatch correspondent Kelly O'Grady breaks down the job report numbers, and CBS News' Natalie Brand has the latest updates from the White House. Top White House trade adviser Peter Navarro praised the work of the Department of Government Efficiency, formerly led by Musk, and expressed doubt that the feud would affect DOGE efforts in the future. \"Waste, fraud and abuse, unfortunately, is alive and well in America, and the DOGE folks here, they're good folks,\" he told reporters at the White House Friday. \"When you work with them and bring to them the institutional knowledge of our bureaucracies' work and what's important in a bureaucracy and what's not, when you wed to that, it's a great thing. So, we're happy.\" He said of Musk that he was \"a special government employee with an expiration date\" and added that he works with DOGE staff \"a lot here.\" The alliance between President Trump and Elon Muskwent up in flamesThursday, days after the world's richest man left the administration and tried to wield his influence to kill a massive budget bill that is central to enacting the president's top legislative priorities. Their spat played out in public and marked another remarkable turn for Musk, who spent tens of millions on Mr. Trump's reelection campaign and was given the reins to slash the size of the federal government.Here's a look back at how Mr. Trump and Musk got here. By Caitlin Yilek and Joe Walsh In response to the spat between Mr. Trump and Musk, Vice President JD Vance reaffirmed his loyalty to the president, writing onsocial mediathat he has \"done more than any person in my lifetime to earn the trust of the movement he leads. I'm proud to stand beside him.\" As the feud between Mr. Trump and Musk unfolded Thursday, the billionaire claimed on X, the social media platform he owns, that the president's name appeared in the filesrelated to the caseof Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier who faced charges of sex trafficking and died by suicide while in federal custody in 2019. He said \"that is the real reason\" the files haven't been released to the public. Musk teased the allegation by claiming it was \"time to drop the really big bomb.\" Trump administration officials pledged to release more files related to Epstein's case once the president returned to the White House for his second term. The Justice Department in Februaryreleased some informationto more than a dozen right-wing influencers, but some who were part of the group said they learned nothing new.

    "title": "Officer Krystal Rivera was accidentally shot and killed by fellow officer, CPD says",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 6, 2025 / 11:17 PM EDT/ CBS Chicago Chicago police confirmed Friday night that Officer Krystal Rivera was accidentallyshot and killedby a fellow officer while chasing a suspect after an investigatory stop in Chatham Thursday night. Officer Krystal Rivera was among officers on a tactical team who were on patrol in the South Side neighborhood when they attempted to conduct an investigatory stop in the 8220 block of South Drexel Avenue just before 10 p.m. Police said, as the officers approached, the suspect ran into a nearby apartment and the officers gave chase. Sources said Rivera and her partner followed the suspect to the second floor of the apartment building, into a home. Chicago Police Supt. Larry Snelling said that when the officers got into that apartment, they were confronted with a second person who pointed a rifle at them. \"At some point an officer discharged a weapon,\" Snelling said. In a statement Friday night, police confirmed that the only person who fired a weapon during the incident was an officer, \"whose gunfire unintentionally struck Officer Rivera.\" Sources said the officer who fired the shot was Rivera's partner. Several people were taken into custody after the shooting, including one person believed to have been the one with the rifle inside the apartment. No charges have yet been announced. Police said the investigation remained open Friday night, and the person who had the rifle remained in custody. \"Detectives also continue to investigate the circumstances that led to the investigative stop preceding the encounter. At this time, no further information is available while the investigation continues,\" police said. Rivera was rushed to the hospital by her fellow officers, but while they on the way, their vehicle caught fire due to a mechanical issue. Rivera had to be put in another vehicle, which took her to University of Chicago Medical Center, where she died. \"There was some type of malfunction in that vehicle that caught fire, but assisting officers came in and she was transferred to another vehicle and driven to the hospital,\" Snelling said. An autopsy determined Rivera was shot in the back, according to the Cook County Medical Examiner's office. \"We ask that the city continue to pray for fallen Officer Krystal Rivera's family during this heartbreaking time. We also ask that the people of Chicago pray for Officer Rivera's partner as he faces the loss of his fellow CPD family member. Though her loss weighs heavy on our department, we will continue to do all we can to protect our city in memory of Officer Rivera and her sacrifice,\" police said. CPD and the Civilian Office of Police Accountability were investigating the shooting. Former Chicago Police Board president Ghian Foreman said that COPA will review all of the available evidence for their investigation, including conducting interviews and obtaining body camera video if possible to determine how officers conducted the investigatory stop. \"Was the body cam on? Did they announce their arrival?\" Foreman said. The body camera video could be key in the investigation, as it could show where the suspect was and what he was doing at the time Rivera and her partner entered the apartment. \"For example, did he have a gun in his hand? Was it raised?\" said Foreman. Rivera, 36, was a four-year veteran of the department and a mother. Snelling described her as vibrant and fearless, saying she showed up to work every day ready to be bold and work hard, and was dedicating to protecting others. Despite grieving the loss of one of an officer under his command, Snelling and Mayor Brandon Johnson on Friday evening took part in the 8th annual \"We Walk for Her March\" in Bronzeville, which is dedicated to bringing awareness to the unsolved cases of missing Black and Brown women in Chicago. Snelling said he made it a point to attend the event, despite the long and heartbreaking day for the department, because Rivera was dedicated to saving lives. \"What better place to acknowledge her, her life, and the fact that she gave her life for the people who are out here today?\" Snelling said. \"When I think about Krystal Rivera, Officer Krystal Rivera, and the work she was doing, she was taking guns off the streets, she was going after the bad people who were doing harm to others, and she wanted justice. She wanted justice for the people that you see standing, and marching, and walking out here right now today.\" Snelling said as the city mourns, it's just as important to remember the vow every officer takes to protect, even when they're grieving. \"This is my family. The Chicago Police Department, these members are my family, and when we lose a family member, it's tough, it's hard; but those family members are resilient, they're tough. They would want you to keep moving on,\" he said. Rivera was the second police officer from the 6th District killed recently in Chatham. In November 2024,Officer Enrique Martinez was shot and killed during a traffic stop near 80th and Ingleside. In addition, in February, a 27-year-old officer assigned to the district died by suicide. Dr. Carrie Steiner, a former Chicago police officer turned police and public service psychologist, said she is particularly concerned about the officers in that district. \"This is a lot of cumulative trauma, and so I am really worried about all of the officers there, and how they're feeling. I think that right now everybody's more so in shock, and some of them are saying, \"I think I'm doing okay,' but I really feel like I need to check in on them in 24 hours or 48 hours, and see how they're doing,\" she said. \"Some of them are also like, really, like, 'I can't handle this. I can't keep doing this.'\" Suzanne Le Mignot serves as CBS2 Chicago's weekend news morning anchor and weekday reporter. © 2025 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "title": "Judge approves NCAA settlement, clearing way for schools to pay athletes",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News June 6, 2025 / 10:43 PM EDT/ CBS/AP A federal judge signed off on arguably the biggest change in the history of college sports on Friday, clearing the way for schools tobegin paying their athletesmillions of dollars as soon as next month as the multibillion-dollar industry shreds the last vestiges of the amateur model that defined it for more than a century. Nearly five years after Arizona State swimmer Grant House sued the NCAA and its five biggest conferences to lift restrictions on revenue sharing, U.S. Judge Claudia Wilken approved the final proposal that had been hung up on roster limits, just one of many changes ahead amid concerns that thousands of walk-on athletes will lose their chance to play college sports. The sweeping terms of the so-called House settlement include approval for each school to share up to $20.5 million with athletes over the next year and $2.7 billion that will be paid over the next decade to thousands of former playerswho were barredfrom that revenue for years. In a letterpennedby NCAA President Charlie Baker following the announcement, Baker wrote that the settlement \"opens a pathway to begin stabilizing college sports. This new framework that enables schools to provide direct financial benefits to student-athletes and establishes clear and specific rules to regulate third-party NIL [name, image and likeness] agreements marks a huge step forward for college sports.\" The agreement brings a seismic shift to hundreds of schools that were forced to reckon with the reality that their players are the ones producing the billions in TV and other revenue, mostly through football and basketball, that keep this machine humming. The scope of the changes — some have already begun — is difficult to overstate. The professionalization of college athletics will be seen in the high-stakes and expensive recruitment of stars on their way to the NFL and NBA, and they will be felt by athletes whose schools have decided to pare their programs. The agreement will resonate in nearly every one of the NCAA's 1,100 member schools boasting nearly 500,000 athletes. Wilken's ruling comes 11 years after she dealt the first significant blow to the NCAA ideal of amateurism when she ruled in favor of former UCLA basketball player Ed O'Bannon and others who were seeking a way to earn money from the use of their name, image and likeness, or NIL — a term that is now as common in college sports as \"March Madness\" or \"Roll Tide.\" It was just four years ago that the NCAA cleared the way for NIL money to start flowing, but the changes coming are even bigger. Wilken granted preliminary approval to the settlement last October. That sent colleges scurrying to determine not only how they were going to afford the payments, but how to regulate an industry that also allows players to cut deals with third parties so long as they are deemed compliant by a newly formed enforcement group that will be run by auditors at Deloitte. The agreement takes a big chunk of oversight away from the NCAA and puts it in the hands of the four biggest conferences. The ACC, Big Ten, Big 12 and SEC hold most of the power and decision-making heft, especially when it comes to the College Football Playoff, which is the most significant financial driver in the industry and is not under the NCAA umbrella like the March Madness tournaments are. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia brought back to U.S. to face human smuggling charges",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 6, 2025 / 10:28 PM EDT/ CBS News Washington —Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant who the Trump administration admitted wasmistakenly deportedback to his home country, has been returned to the U.S. to face two federal criminal counts that were detailed in anindictmentunsealed on Friday. Filed in the federal district court in Nashville, the indictment charges Abrego Garcia with one count of conspiracy to transport aliens and one count of unlawful transportation of undocumented aliens. Abrego Garcia was removed from the U.S. in March and flown to El Salvador, where he was initially held at a notorious supermax prison. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in remarks Friday at the Justice Department that the Salvadoran government agreed to return Abrego Garcia to face the criminal charges after it was presented with an arrest warrant. \"Abrego Garcia has landed in the United States to face justice,\" Bondi said, adding: \"This is what American justice looks like.\" ABC News firstreportedFriday that he was being brought back to the U.S. to face the charges. A federal grand jury returned the indictment on May 21. The Justice Department said in acourt filingthat Abrego Garcia should be held in pretrial custody because \"he poses a danger to the community and a serious risk of flight, and no condition or combination of conditions would ensure the safety of the community or his appearance in court.\" Bondi said the grand jury found that Abrego Garcia \"played a significant role in an alien smuggling ring\" that involved children and women and is \"a danger to our community.\" If Abrego Garcia is convicted, he would serve his sentence in the U.S. and then return to El Salvador, according to the attorney general. In her remarks, Bondi strayed beyond what was alleged in the indictment, claiming that Abrego Garcia played a role in the murder of a rival gang member's mother and solicited naked pictures from a minor. Neither of those allegations appear in the charging documents. Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Abrego Garcia's attorney, said in a statement that due process \"means the chance to defend yourself before you're punished, not after. This is an abuse of power, not justice.\" He said the government \"disappeared Kilmar to a foreign prison in violation of a court order. Now, after months of delay and secrecy, they're bringing him back, not to correct their error but to prosecute him.\" During a brief news conference Friday, Sandoval-Moshenberg added that Abrego Garcia is \"not going to be convicted of these crimes.\" \"There's no way a jury is going to see the evidence and agree that this sheet metal worker is the leader of an international MS-13 smuggling conspiracy,\" he said. Abrego Garcia made an initial court appearance on Friday and remains in the custody of U.S. Marshals. His next hearing was scheduled for June 13. The filing alleges that between 2016 and 2025, Abrego Garcia and others conspired to bring migrants from Latin American countries to the U.S., passing through Mexico before crossing the southern border into Texas. Prosecutors allege that Abrego Garcia and an unidentified co-conspirator picked up the migrants in Houston and transported them to other parts of the U.S., and devised \"cover stories\" to give to law enforcement in the event they were stopped — like transporting people for construction work. The Justice Department said that Abrego Garcia and six co-conspirators used cellphones and social media platforms to move migrants into and throughout the U.S. He allegedly worked with two of the co-conspirators to transport firearms that were purchased illegally in Texas for distribution and resale in Maryland, where Abrego Garcia lived. Abrego Garcia and the six others also allegedly collected financial payments from migrants for their movements, according to the indictment. That money was then transferred between one another, the Justice Department said, claiming it was an effort to hide their origins. The indictment claims that Abrego Garcia and his co-conspirators \"knowingly and unlawfully transported thousands\" of migrants who were not legally authorized to live or work in the U.S., and alleges that many of those people were members of the gang MS-13 and associates. The filing includes information about a November 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee, when Abrego Garcia was pulled over by the state Highway Patrol for speeding. The agency released body camera footage from the incident. Abrego Garcia had at least eight people in the car with him when he was stopped. He said that they had been performing construction work at a site in St. Louis, Missouri. AnApril reportfrom the Department of Homeland Security about the incident said Aberego Garcia was suspected of human trafficking, though he was not arrested or charged with any crime. Abrego Garcia was escorted into the Nashville courtroom Friday by two Homeland Security Investigations agents. Both sat at opposite ends of him during the hearing. Abrego Garcia, in a white-colored, short-sleeved button-down shirt and jeans, appeared confused and tired during the hearing, and mostly kept his head down while waiting for Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes to enter the courtroom. He remained mostly stoic for the full length of the hearing, making no notable facial expressions or showing any strong emotion. His attorney, a public defender, noted that he had little time to speak with his client beforehand, and said he had only received a copy of the indictment in English. The attorney said he had been working to have the entire indictment read to Abrego Garcia in Spanish, but \"only made it halfway\" through before Abrego Garcia was escorted into the courtroom. The judge said she intends to set a detention hearing for next week. Abrego Garcia's attorney argued he should be released from custody, saying the Justice Department did not prove the defendant is a flight risk or a danger to the community. Following a lengthy recess and discussion, Holmes decided Abrego Garcia will remain in the custody of U.S. Marshals until his next hearing on June 13 at 11 a.m. ET. Holmes said that hearing will serve to determine if prosecutors have the basis to request a detention hearing in the first place, and if so, that hearing will also serve as a detention hearing and his arraignment. Abrego Garcia's case sparked nationwide backlash after an immigration official in the Trump administration acknowledged thathis deportation to El Salvadorwas an \"administrative error.\" The 29-year-old had been granted a legal status in 2019, known as withholding of removal, that forbade the Department of Homeland Security from removing him to his home country of El Salvador because he was likely to face persecution by local gangs. Abrego Garcia was among themore than 200 peoplewho were boarded onto planes bound for El Salvador in mid-March for confinement in the country'snotorious maximum-securityTerrorism Confinement Center, known as CECOT. The removals were part of the Trump administration's efforts to crack down on illegal immigration, which have prompted numerous legal battles across the country. Abrego Garcia, who hadlived in Marylandsince he came to the U.S. unlawfully in 2011, was initially held at CECOT but eventuallymoved to a lower-security facility, according to Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, whomet with Abrego Garciain El Salvador in April. The State Department laterconfirmedhe had been transferred. Sandoval-Moshenberg, Abrego Garcia's attorney, said Friday that Abrego Garcia \"is one of the first, if not the first person\" to leave CECOT and he was curious to hear about his treatment there. \"So it's going to be very interesting to hear what he has to say about the way in which he was treated in that prison by the Salvadoran authorities, especially his first days in that prison before the Salvadoran government realized that he was special in the object of attention in the United States,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg said. Van Hollen on Friday said that the Trump administration has for months been flouting the Supreme Court and the Constitution. \"Today, they appear to have finally relented to our demands for compliance with court orders and with the due process rights afforded to everyone in the United States,\" he said in a statement. \"As I have repeatedly said, this is not about the man, it's about his constitutional rights — and the rights of all. The administration will now have to make its case in the court of law, as it should have all along.\" Abrego Garcia's case, and U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis' orders for the government to take steps to bring him back to the U.S. was the catalyst for an escalating clash between the Trump administration and the courts that has played out over the past few weeks. The government was accused of defying Xinis' demand that it facilitate his release from Salvadoran custody — which wasaffirmed by the Supreme Court— and refusing to provide any details about what efforts it had taken to do so. The Trump administration has claimed Abrego Garcia is a member of the gangMS-13, citing an allegation from a confidential informant and the clothes he was wearing when he was arrested in 2019, after which he was released from custody. His lawyers have denied that Abrego Garcia has any ties to MS-13, and said he has never been charged or convicted of a crime in the U.S. or El Salvador. Three courts — the district court on which Xinis sits, afederal appeals courtand the Supreme Court — all said the Trump administration had to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from Salvadoran custody. The Supreme Court also directed the government to ensure that his case \"is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.\" But lawyers for Abrego Garcia said the administration has defied those decisions by repeatedly refusing to take steps to bring him back to the U.S. or provide any information about whether it has even made attempts to do so. In response, Xinisordered an expedited examinationinto the Trump administration's refusal to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. and allowed his lawyers to pose 15 questions to government officials and make 15 requests for documents. Abrego Garcia's lawyers told Xinis that the Trump administrationturned over \"nothing of substance\"and provided \"non-responsive\" answers to their questions. The judge thenblasted the administrationfor its responses and blamed it for \"continued mischaracterization\" of the Supreme Court's order. She said their objection to certain requests for information \"reflects a willful and bad faith refusal to comply with discovery obligations.\" Regarding the administration's attempts to invoke certain privileges to shield certain details from Abrego Garcia's lawyers, the judge said they rely on \"boilerplate assertions.\" \"That ends now,\" Xinis wrote.

    "title": "Meet the horses running in the Belmont Stakes",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 6, 2025 / 9:58 PM EDT/ CBS News TheBelmont Stakesis set to host a rematch in New York on Saturday of the top three finishing horses from the Kentucky Derby to close out horse racing's Triple Crown for 2025. Five weeks after Sovereigntywon the Derbyover Journalism and Baeza, the three horses will be among the eight competing in the last race of the Triple Crown — the series for 3-year-olds consisting of the Derby, the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont. Sovereignty's connections chose toskip the Preaknessin Baltimore to prepare for the Belmont, meaning no horse would win the Triple Crown this year. Journalism, whowon the Preaknesstwo weeks after coming in second at the Derby, was picked as the morning-line favorite for the Belmont with 8-5 odds. Theoddswill change as bettors place their wagers leading up to Saturday's approximate post time of 7:04 p.m. EDT. Here's a list of all the horses racing in the Belmont in order by their number with their morning-line odds: The Belmont will be 1 1/4 miles long instead of the usual 1 1/2 miles, making the race known as the Test of the Champion the same length as the Derby. The change is because the Belmont is temporarily being held at Saratoga Race Course in Saratoga Springs, New York, about a 45-minute drive north of the state capital of Albany. \"Shame the Belmont is not a mile-and-a-half,\" said Heart of Honor's trainer, Jamie Osborne, according to a news release after the Preakness. The brown colt didn't have the best start, but passed four horses to finish fifth in the 1 3/16-mile race, the shortest of the Triple Crown races. The Belmont is expected to return to Long Island's Belmont Park next year after the completion of amassive redevelopment project. While the Triple Crown has been won twice in the past decade — with American Pharoahending a 37-year droughtin 2015 andJustifyin 2018 — winning just the Preakness and the Belmont has become more of a novelty. It was last accomplishedin 2005by Afleet Alex, who finished third in the Derby. At the Preakness, Journalism barreled down the stretch to overcome Gosger and win by half a length at Pimlico Race Course. The bay colt was the morning-line favorite for the Preakness as well as the Derby, winning over oddsmakers with four straight victories in California, including April's Santa Anita Derby, March's San Felipe Stakes and December's Los Alamitos Futurity Stakes. Jockey Umberto Rispoli, who was aboard Journalism for those three races, the Preakness and the Derby, will have the mount again for the Belmont. Journalism's trainer,Michael McCarthy, has only had one other horse in the Belmont, Rombauer, who came in third in 2021. With 2-1 odds in the morning line, Sovereignty will try to achieve a rarer feat than winning just the Preakness and the Belmont: victories at the Derby and the Belmont. The last horse to do that was Thunder Gulch in 1995 after finishing third at the Preakness. While Sovereignty  skipped the Triple Crown's middle jewel, the bay colt wasn't completely out of the news. His jockey, Junior Alvarado, wasfined $62,000and suspended for two racing days in Kentucky by the state's Board of Stewards for allegedly using his riding crop too much in the Derby. Alvarado is appealing the decision. Alvarado will be riding Sovereignty on Saturday, which will be the jockey's fourth mount in the Belmont. Last year, he was aboard Resilience, who finished in 10th place and was trained by Bill Mott. The two have teamed up again with Sovereignty. Mott has trained a Belmont winner before — Drosselmeyer, whowon in 2010. Sovereignty comes into the Belmont after finishing second at March's Florida Derby and winning the Fountain of Youth Stakes in Florida and October's Street Sense Stakes at Churchill Downs, the home of the Derby. Baeza didn't initially draw a post for the Derby and only entered the field when Rodriguez was scratched from the race two days before the Run for the Roses. He broke from the post on the far outside and came in third behind Journalism by a neck. Before the Derby, the bay colt came in second at the Santa Anita Derby, also behind Journalism. Baeza was given 4-1 morning-line odds for the Belmont and will be under Flavien Prat, who also had the mount in the Derby. Prat's been in the past four runnings of the Belmont, riding Hot Rod Charlie to second place in 2021. Trainer John Shirreffs has had three other horses in the Belmont, most recently Gormley, who came in fourthin 2017. Rodriguez wasscratched from the Derbyover what co-owner Tom Ryan described as a \"small but slightly sensitive foot bruise.\" Trainer Bob Baffert said the dark bay colt has healed and is performing as well as he was before he won the Wood Memorial Stakes in April at New York City's Aqueduct Racetrack, according to a New York Racing Association news release. Baffert has trained three Belmont winners: American Pharoah, Justify and Point Given, whowon the raceby 12 1/2 lengths in 2001. With 6-1 odds in the morning line, Rodriguez will be under Mike Smith, who's looking for his fourth Belmont win. Hill Road, who was given 10-1 morning-line odds for the Belmont, won the Peter Pan Stakes at Aqueduct last month and finished third in the Tampa Bay Derby in March and in November's Breeders' Cup Juvenile in California. Irad Ortiz Jr. will be aboard the bay colt in pursuit of his third Belmont win, most recently ridingMo Donegalto victory in 2022. Hill Road will be trainer Chad Brown's fifth career entry in the race. He's still seeking his first Belmont win after coming close with third-place Sierra Leone in 2024 and second-place Gronkowski in 2018. Crudo, who's co-owned by celebrity chefBobby Flay, was given 15-1 odds in the morning line. The bay colt won the Sir Barton Stakes, one of the undercard races for the Preakness, and will be trainer Todd Pletcher's chance for a fifth Belmont win. John Velazquez will have the mount, going for his third victory at the race. Pletcher's second horse in the race, Uncaged, won at Saratoga in August and at Aqueduct in April but came in sixth at the Peter Pan. With 30-1 morning-line odds, the bay colt will be under Luis Saez, who won the Belmont withDornochlast year and withEssential Qualityin 2021. With Heart of Honor, the other horse to be given 30-1 odds in the morning line, Saffie Osborne has a chance to become the first woman to ride to victory in a Triple Crown race since Julie Krone won the Belmont in 1993 aboard Colonial Affair. In addition to finishing fifth at the Preakness, the British-bred brown colt raced in the United Arab Emirates, coming in second at the UAE Derby in April.

    "title": "Teen helps coworkers on his graduation night, rewarded with big donations",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News June 6, 2025 / 9:07 PM EDT/ CBS News Dacula, Georgia— At a Burger King in Dacula, Georgia, 18-year-old Mykale Baker is known for his whopper of a work ethic. He shows up early, stays late, and looks at every shift like a privilege. \"I like helping people and not expecting anything back from it,\" Baker told CBS News. \"That's just me.\" That work ethic created some good karma for Baker. \"I knew that all the good I put out there is going to come back to me somehow,\" Baker said. Baker's high school graduation night arrived in May. He left the ceremony and dropped by Burger King for a late meal. That is when he noticed his colleagues were absolutely swamped with orders. At this point, most teens would have just been glad they had the night off and been on their way. But instead, Baker did what Baker does. \"I wasn't even clocked in,\" Baker said. \"I just put gloves on and said, 'What do you all need help with?'\" So, with his graduation sash and medals still draped around his neck, Baker hopped on the line. The whole thing was caught on camera by customer Maria Mendoza, who just could not believe her eyes. \"There's not a lot of people who are like that,\" Mendoza said. \"…Thirteen years of school, you graduate. The last thing I would think is somebody would go to work!\" Mendoza was so impressed, that she posted the video online and started a crowdfunding campaign to reward Baker for his integrity and dedication. The campaign has raised more than $200,000. Baker plans to use that money to go trade school become a master auto mechanic and eventually open his own shop. The Burger King Foundation later surprised Baker with $10,000. The foundation also gave Mendoza $10,000 for her daughter, Daizie, who also just graduated high school. Baker said his mother, Demeshiah Scott, always taught him to work hard, even if you think no one is watching, because you never know when someone is. Steve Hartman is a CBS News correspondent.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 6, 2025 / 8:57 PM EDT/ CBS News Washington— Federal law enforcement agencies have issued a new intelligence bulletin, obtained by CBS News, warning that recentattacks in Boulder, Colorado, at theCapital Jewish Museumin Washington, D.C., and at thePennsylvania governor's residence\"could motivate others to conduct violence against Israeli and Jewish institutions, or their supporters.\" The memo was issued by the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and the National Counterterrorism Center to law enforcement nationwide Wednesday, voicing concern that \"some individuals online are sharing the manifesto of the alleged Capital Jewish Museum attacker, praising their actions, and calling for additional violence.\" \"We advise security partners to remain vigilant for threats of targeted violence against Jewish and Israeli communities, and their supporters,\" the memo says. On Sunday, a suspect allegedly used Molotov cocktails toattacka march for Israeli hostages in Boulder, Colorado, injuring more than a dozen people. He has since been charged with 118 state criminal charges, including 28 counts of attempted murder. On May 21, two Israeli Embassy employees,Yaron LischinskyandSarah Lynn Milgrim, were shot and killed as they left the Capital Jewish Museum. Thesuspect, who shouted \"Free Palestine\" as he was taken into custody, faces first-degree murder charges. And in April, PennsylvaniaGov. Josh Shapiro, who is Jewish, was allegedly targeted by a man who officials say intentionallyset fire to the governor's residencewhile Shapiro and his family were home asleep. The suspect has been charged with attempted murder, terrorism and other crimes. The law enforcement bulletin said intelligence analysts assess that \"online messaging promoting violence by foreign terrorist organizations, their supporters, and other threat actors particularly messaging that highlights successful attacks –- could compel threat actors motivated by various ideologies to engage in violence.\" The law enforcement agencies also warned that foreign terrorist organizations have pushed content encouraging violence regarding the Israel-Hamas conflict, \"and the online messaging is one of many factors that has influenced the radicalization of violent extremists.\" Kathryn  Watsoncontributed to this report.

    "title": "Tariffs are causing Alaska Airlines to cancel flights. Here's why.",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 6, 2025 / 8:56 PM EDT/ CBS News Alaska Airlinesis canceling more than a dozen flights a day as tariffs hinder its ability to accept delivery of new aircraft, according to the carrier. The Seattle, Washington-based airline said it wouldn't immediately accept delivery of two Embraer 175 regional jets in order to avoid incurring the extra tariff-related costs. The aircraft were meant to serve Horizon Air, a regional subsidiary of Alaska Airlines. President Trump's tariff agenda has upendedsupply chainsfor a range of businesses, and has forced many companies toraise prices on consumersin order to protect their margins. The aviation industry has also warned that the levies will affect its business. \"We deeply regret the impact this situation will have on our guests this summer,\" Alaska Airlines said in a statement to CBS News Wednesday. \"Amid the ongoing uncertain economic environment, we are focused on controlling what we can control — including costs, productivity, operational performance and taking care of our guests to the best of our ability. As part of this effort to control our costs, Alaska will not accept additional costs imposed by tariffs throughout our supply chain,\" it added. Without the new aircraft, Alaska said it must cancel 14 flights a day through the end of July. Horizon operates all of its flights on Embraer jets. Alaska operates an all-Boeing fleet. The delayed aircraft were expected to arrive from Brazil in May. Brazilian imports to the United States have been subject to a 10% tariff since April. Delta Air Lines also took steps to avoid paying tariffs on new aircraft earlier this year. In April, it had new Airbus A350 airlines delivered from France to Japan, and flew the planes internationally first, before bringing them to the U.S. Because the aircraft were not new on arrival in the U.S., the airline was not on the hook for paying tariffs on them. The new planes had been scheduled to arrive by the end of May and were expected to go into service during the summer season for Horizon, which serves the Pacific Northwest, Alaska, California, Colorado, Utah and western Canada. Alaska said it is cutting routes that are served by multiple flights, so that no single route is eliminated entirely, even temporarily. \"When deciding which flights to cancel, we put our guests at the center of consideration. We don't take these decisions lightly as we know it means disruption for our guests and their travel plans. We assessed our network and protected the communities we serve that already have limited service. Our teams are working to reaccommodate all impacted guests on the next best option for their travel plans,\" Alaska said in a statement. Kris  Van Cleavecontributed to this report.

    "title": "Elon Musk suggests creating a new political party amid Trump rift",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News June 6, 2025 / 8:43 PM EDT/ CBS News Elon Musk publicly mused about creating a new political party this week, an idea that could escalate the billionaire's feud with his onetime ally President Trump. Musk first floated the idea on Thursday. In between jabs at Mr. Trump, the billionaire posted a poll to X asking his 220 million followers if they think it's \"time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle.\" A day later, Musknoted that80% of respondents to the poll backed the idea. \"This is fate,\" he wrote Friday evening. Musk thenendorsed a fan's suggestionthat he name it the \"America Party.\" The name bears a resemblance to America PAC, the political action committeefounded by Musklast year that was his main vehicle for spending $239 million to help elect Mr. Trump and other Republican candidates in 2024. Starting a new political party is easier said than done. The Democratic and Republican parties, and some of the larger third parties,already have ballot accessin virtually every state, so an upstart party that hopes to be competitive would need to navigate a web of state-by-state rules to get its candidates on the ballot. And while Musk — the world's richest person — is legally allowed to pour unlimited money into his America PAC because it is organized as an independent super PAC,donations to formal political partiesare capped at well under $1 million, per the Federal Election Commission's contribution limits for 2025-2026 federal elections. It's not clear how serious Musk is about the idea of breaking with the Republican Party. Later Friday, the billionairereplied\"Ok\" to a person who argued \"the best bang for your buck\" is to get involved in GOP primaries. He alsoseemed to entertaina post that suggested reforming one of the main parties \"from the inside out\" instead of starting a third party, replying \"Hmm.\" Still, Musk's musings about starting a new political party could signal he plans to stay engaged in politics, and may try to challenge Mr. Trump's influence. Musksaid last monthhe planned on dialing back his political spending generally, saying at the time that he didn't \"see a reason\" to keep putting his money into politics, though he left open the possibility of getting involved again. His time leading the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency also came to an end last week, with Mr. Trump publicly expressing support. But Musk began directly challenging Mr. Trump on Tuesday, calling the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — a sprawling domestic policy bill backed by Mr. Trump — a \"disgusting abomination\" and urging lawmakers tovote againstit. The two men publicly sparred on Thursday, with Mr. Trump threatening to cut off subsidies to Musk's companies, while Musk claimed the president was ungrateful for the hundreds of millions he poured into helping the 2024 Trump campaign. Musk entered the congressional fray at a delicate moment for the GOP. The party's domestic policy bill narrowly passed the House last month, but it still needs to go through the Senate, and if the upper chamber makes any changes, it will need to head back to the House again. Muskoffered a pointed suggestionThursday afternoon to any congressional Republicans who may be unsure of whether to side with him or the president, writing on X: \"Trump has 3.5 years left as President, but I will be around for 40+ years.\" Joe Walsh is a senior editor for digital politics at CBS News.

    "title": "U.S. judge approves $2.8 billion settlement, paving way for colleges to pay athletes millions",
    "article_text": "A federal judge signed off on arguably the biggest change in the history of college sports Friday, clearing the way for schools to begin paying their athletes millions of dollars as soon as next month as the multibillion-dollar industry shreds the last vestiges of the amateur model that defined it for more than a century. Nearly five years after Arizona State swimmer Grant House sued the NCAA and its five biggest conferences to lift restrictions on revenue sharing, U.S. Judge Claudia Wilken approved the final proposal that had been hung up on roster limits, just one of many changes ahead amid concerns that thousands of walk-on athletes will lose their chance to play college sports. The sweeping terms of the so-called House settlement include approval for each school to share up to $20.5 million with athletes over the next year and $2.7 billion that will be paid over the next decade to thousands of former players who were barred from that revenue for years. The agreement brings a seismic shift to hundreds of schools that were forced to reckon with the reality that their players are the ones producing the billions in TV and other revenue, mostly through football and basketball, that keep this machine humming. The scope of the changes — some have already begun — is difficult to overstate. The professionalization of college athletics will be seen in the high-stakes and expensive recruitment of stars on their way to the NFL and NBA, and they will be felt by athletes whose schools have decided to pare their programs. The agreement will resonate in nearly every one of the NCAA’s 1,100 member schools boasting nearly 500,000 athletes. Wilken’s ruling comes 11 years after she dealt the first significant blow to the NCAA ideal of amateurism when she ruled in favor of former UCLA basketball player Ed O’Bannon and others who were seeking a way to earn money from the use of their name, image and likeness (NIL) — a term that is now as common in college sports as “March Madness” or “Roll Tide.” It was just four years ago that theNCAA cleared the way for NIL moneyto start flowing, but the changes coming are even bigger. Wilken granted preliminary approval to the settlement last October. That sent colleges scurrying to determine not only how they were going to afford the payments, but how to regulate an industry that also allows players to cut deals with third parties so long as they are deemed compliant by a newly formed enforcement group that will be run by auditors at Deloitte. The agreement takes a big chunk of oversight away from the NCAA and puts it in the hands of the four biggest conferences. The ACC, Big Ten, Big 12 and SEC hold most of the power and decision-making heft, especially when it comes to the College Football Playoff, which is the most significant financial driver in the industry and is not under the NCAA umbrella like the March Madness tournaments are. The deal looked ready to go since last fall, but Wilken put a halt to it after listening to a number of players who had lost their spots because of newly imposed roster limits being placed on teams. The limits were part of a trade-off that allowed the schools to offer scholarships to everyone on the roster, instead of only a fraction, as has been the case for decades. Schools started cutting walk-ons in anticipation of the deal being approved. Wilken asked for a solution and, after weeks, the parties decided to let anyone cut from a roster — now termed a “Designated Student-Athlete” — return to their old school or play for a new one without counting against the new limit. Wilken ultimately agreed, going point-by-point through the objectors’ arguments to explain why they didn’t hold up. “The modifications provide Designated Student-Athletes with what they had prior to the roster limits provisions being implemented, which was the opportunity to be on a roster at the discretion of a Division I school,” Wilken wrote The list of winners and losers is long and, in some cases, hard to tease out. A rough guide of winners would include football and basketball stars at the biggest schools, which will devote much of their bankroll to signing and retaining them. For instance, Michigan quarterback Bryce Underwood’s NIL deal is reportedly worth between $10.5 million and $12 million. Losers, despite Wilken’s ruling, figure to be at least some of the walk-ons and partial scholarship athletes whose spots are gone. Also in limbo are Olympic sports many of those athletes play and that serve as the main pipeline for a U.S. team that has won the most medals at every Olympics since the downfall of the Soviet Union. All this is a price worth paying, according to the attorneys who crafted the settlement and argue they delivered exactly what they were asked for: an attempt to put more money in the pockets of the players whose sweat and toil keep people watching from the start of football season through March Madness and the College World Series in June. What the settlement does not solve is the threat of further litigation. Though this deal brings some uniformity to the rules, states still have separate laws regarding how NIL can be doled out, which could lead to legal challenges. NCAA President Charlie Baker has been consistent in pushing for federal legislation that would put college sports under one rulebook and, if he has his way, provide some form of antitrust protection to prevent the new model from being disrupted again.",

Much like last yearand the playoff run to this point, Sergei Bobrovsky was dialed in when he was needed the most, making some unreal saves while stopping 42 of the 46 shots he faced. His teammates provided the necessary goal support. Along with Marchand, Sam Bennett scored his postseason-leading 13th goal and NHL record 12th on the road. Seth Jones scored into a wide-open net after some spectacular tic-tac-toe passing, and fellow defenseman Dmitry Kulikov tied it with a shot through traffic that Stuart Skinner almost certainly did not see. Kulikov’s goal came after Florida controlled play for several minutes in the second, hemming Edmonton in its zone shift after shift and piling up a 34-13 advantage in shot attempts during the period. Marchand’s OT goal was his 10th career goal in the final to lead all active players. Game 3 is Monday night as the teams traverse the continent and play shifts to Sunrise. The Panthers wrested home-ice advantage away from the Oilers by splitting the first two, rebounding from a Game 1 overtime loss and asserting they won’t go quietly against Draisaitl and Connor McDavidlooking like they’ll do everything in their powerto hoist the Cup for the first time. Of course, those stars had their moments. They assisted on Evan Bouchard’s goal when coach Kris Knoblauch put them on the ice together, and McDavid stickhandled through multiple defenders in highlight-reel fashion to set up Draisaitl scoring on the power play. There were a lot of those — 10 in total — after officials whistled 14 penalties, including three in the first four minutes. Each team had a few calls it was not happy with, though most of that evened out over the course of the game.",

    "title": "DHS wants National Guard to search for and transport unaccompanied migrant children",
    "article_text": "A Department of Homeland Security request for 21,000 National Guard troops to support \"expansive interior immigration enforcement operations\" includes a call for troops to search for unaccompanied children in some cases and transport them between states, three sources briefed on the plan tell NBC News. Having National Guard troops perform such tasks, which are not explained in detail in the DHS request, has prompted concern among Democrats in Congress and some military and law enforcement officials. The tasks are laid out in a May 9th Request for Assistance from the Department of Homeland Security to the Pentagon. The document states that, “this represents the first formal request by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for the deployment of National Guard personnel in support of interior immigration enforcement operations.” The request calls for National Guard troops to be used for “Search and Rescue for UACs [Unaccompanied Alien Children] in remote or hostile terrain,” and “Intra- and inter-state transport of detainees/ unaccompanied alien children (UACs),\" without clearly explaining what that would entail. Most of the troops, about 10,000, would be used for transporting detained individuals, the DHS said. Roughly 2,500 troops would be used for detention support but the document does not specify where. Another 1,000 troops would be assigned to administrative support, such as processing detainees. The request also asks for up to 3,500 troops to “Attempt to Locate — Fugitives” and to conduct “surveillance and canvassing missions,” as well as “night operations and rural interdictions.” It also asks for support for ICE in “joint task force operations for absconder/fugitive tracking,” according to the three sources familiar with the plans. NPR first reportedthe details of the DHS request. Democrats in Congress and military and law enforcement officials have expressed concern about the use of National Guard troops to perform what they say are civilian law enforcement duties. One characterized the plan as the Trump administration “finding a way to get the National Guard into the streets and into American homes,” saying, “I fear it’s going to look like a police state.” A second source said, “Trump has said he wants to use the National Guard for law enforcement, and the Pentagon and other entities have always said, ‘Oh, don’t worry, it will never come to that.’ But this is it.” Defense officials say the request has not been approved and is being evaluated by Pentagon policy officials, the General Counsel’s office, and other Pentagon leadership. The officials say the most likely course of action would be for some parts of the request to be approved and others rejected. But one source briefed on the plans said that Secretary of Defense Peter Hegseth is close to approving some elements of the request and considering which state governors to approach first regarding National Guard units. “We are so much closer to this being real,” said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. DHS is requesting the National Guard troops under Title 32 status, which means they would remain on state active duty under the command of their governor but would be federally funded. Title 32 status generally allows National Guard troops to conduct law enforcement activities without violating the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law that bars the use of federal troops in law enforcement operations. A National Guard member who opposes troops performing such tasks told NBC News, “I plan to leave the National Guard soon over this.”",

    "title": "A timeline of the twists and turns in the Trump-Musk relationship",
    "article_text": "The escalatingwar of wordsthis week between President Donald Trump and tech mogul Elon Musk marked the most contentious chapter in a yearslong and at-times rocky relationship between two of the most influential figures in business and politics. Musk, a former Democrat, has criticized Trump in the past, but over the past year forged a strong relationship with the president that positioned him to wield significant power in the early months of Trump's second administration. Those close ties, though, came after years of ups and downs stretching back to 2016 when Musk accepted a spot on several of Trump’sbusiness advisory councils. Here are some of the highlights of Trump and Musk's volatile relationship from the past few years. Musk, who would ultimately emerge as one of the most loyal contributors to Trump's 2024 campaign, was initially a vocal opponent. Despite a solid working relationship with Trump during his first term, the enigmatic tech leader called on Trump to skip the 2024 race. \"I don’t hate the man, but it’s time for Trump to hang up his hat & sail into the sunset,\"Musk wrote on X.\"Trump would be 82 at end of term, which is too old to be chief executive of anything, let alone the United States of America.\" The post was not without provocation — Trump days earlier at a campaign rally in Alaska bashed Musk for his effort to purchase X, then known as Twitter, and for saying in an interview that he never voted for a Republican. \"He told me he voted for me,\" Trump said at the rally. \"He's another bulls--- artist.\" Musk in response threw his support behind Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. \"If DeSantis runs against Biden in 2024, then DeSantis will easily win — he doesn’t even need to campaign,\" he wrote on X. Weeks after officially taking control of X, Musk extended an olive branch to Trump byreinstating his accounton the social media platform — once his favorite online megaphone — after it was banned following the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. Musk reinstated the account on Nov. 19, four days after Trump formally launched his 2024 campaign. By the summer of 2023, Trump had been indicted in three separate criminal cases. Musk, whomonths earlierpredicted Trump would win the 2024 election if arrested, condemned the prosecutions. \"I did not vote for him last election, but such aggressive legal action against a former president is not right,\"Musk wrote. The post served as a shift for Musk, who soon after began posting more sympathetic messages about Trump. In the first few months of 2024, Trump's campaign found itself in a cash crunch after allocatingupwards of $50 milliontoward his legal defense. So when Trump met with Musk alongside several other wealthy Republican donors in Palm Beach, Florida, most political observers were quick to connect the dots. Musk, the world's richest man, has insisted that the meeting was unplanned and maintains that Trump never explicitly requested funding. “I’m not paying his legal bills in any way, shape or form … and he did not ask me for money,” Musksaid in an interviewafter the meeting, though he did say afterward that he was at least \"leaning away\" from President Joe Biden. When asked about their meeting, Trump said he'd\"helped\"Musk in the past, without providing details. According tocampaign finance documents, Musk created America PAC, a pro-Trump Super PAC, on May 22. Soon after,reports emergedthat Trump and Musk had discussed a possible advisory role for the Tesla CEO in a second Trump administration, an effort to ensure Musk would hold a key position in the White House. Less than an hour after an assassination attempt on Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania, Musk officially threw his support behind Trump's candidacy. \"I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery,\" Muskwrote on X. Trump responded by touting reports that Musk planned to contribute $45 million a month to his re-election effort and promising to make life \"good\" for him. \"We have to make life good for our smart people. You know, we have some smart people. We have to make life good for our smart people, and he’s as smart as you get,\" Trump said at his first campaign event after the assassination attempt. In an event billed by Trump's campaign as \"the interview of the century,\" Trump joined Musk for anonline rallyon X. The event was repeatedly delayed due to tech issues, but saw the pair bond over their shared disdain for Biden's immigration policies. It also saw Musk unsuccessfully try to prod Trump into prioritizing renewable energy over fossil fuels. When Trump returned to the site of the first assassination attempt against him, he shared the rally stage with Musk, who accused Democrats of seeking to take away voters' freedom of speech and right to bear arms. Musk emphatically encouraged Trump supporters to \"vote, vote, vote.\" By October, Musk had alreadygiven nearly $75 millionto the super PAC he created to support Trump, according to campaign finance filings. That money was used in part to fund sprawlingget-out-the-votedrives in battleground states, including door-knocking programs in deep-red, traditionally low-turnout areas. Trump's striking victory, in which he won all seven battleground states and the popular vote for the first time, came as Musk's spending for the effort surpassed aquarter billion dollars, according to campaign finance reports. Of that total, $120 million came in the final weeks of the race. In his election night speech, Trump praised Musk, saying, \"A star is born.\" One week after the election,Trump appointedMusk and Vivek Ramaswamy to head up a newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, fulfilling a campaign promise to allow Musk to oversee cuts to government spending. Ramaswamy later left to pursue a gubernatorial bid in Ohio. Toward the end of the month, Trumptraveled to Texasto watch the launch of Musk's SpaceX Starship rocket, despite previously ridiculing the company. Musk spoke at Trump's inauguration rally at Capital One Arena, emphatically lauding Trump's victory, jubilantly raising the prospect of taking DOGE to Mars and thanking the crowd for voting to guarantee \"the future of civilization is assured.\" \"My heart goes out to you,\" Musk said before forcefully touching his heart and raising his hand in a gesture some criticslikened to a Nazi salute.Musk has denied that assertion. Among the first executive ordersTrump signedon Jan. 20 was one that formalized the creation of the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency. The White House officially announced Musk's role in early February, clearing way for him to oversee a wide-ranging effort to reduce to the size of the federal government through mass job cuts, the cancellation of research programs and grants and the dismantling a federal agencies. In an early sign of tensions between Musk and several Cabinet members, Trumpplaced limitson his adviser, making clear in a Truth Social post that staffing decisions across the federal government will be determined by agency heads, not Musk. The Tesla CEO had been exercising authority over rank-and-file federal workers, including a threatto fire themif they didn't respond to inquiries regarding their work output. The new publicly established guardrails appeared to do little to hurt the pair's relationship, with Trump a week later turning the South Lawn of the White House into aTesla show roomto demonstrate support for Musk amid slumping sales for his electric vehicle company. On the first day of May, Musktold reportersat the White House that he would soon step back from DOGE to focus on his companies, comparing the shift to going from full-time to part-time work. The announcement came after Tesla reported a drop in its first-quarter profit and revenue. By the end of the month, Musk's exit was formalized. The White House on May 28 confirmed that Musk's tenure as a special government employee, a temporary role that he soon would legally have to exit anyway, had come to an end. Musk thanked Trump \"for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,\" and the president at a news conference with Musk days later said, \"Elon’s service to America has been without comparison in modern history.\" Trump presented Musk with a gold-colored key at the event. But underneath the polite exchanges hid simmering tension: Musk days earlier appeared on CBS' \"Sunday Morning\" andbashed a massive Republican bill,designed to fund much of Trump's domestic agenda, by condemning the expected impact of the legislation on the national debt. Trump soon after pulled the nomination of billionaire Jared Isaacman, an associate of Musk, to be NASA administrator. Days after formally departing the White House, Musk launched a scathing attack on the Trump-backed bill making its way through Congress. “I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore,”Musk wrote in a poston X. “This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.” Asked about those criticisms, Trump expressed disappointment. \"Elon knew the inner workings of this bill,” Trump told reporters, before suggesting Musk's opposition to the bill was personal. “Elon is upset because we took the EV mandate which was a lot of money for electric vehicles. They’re having a hard time the electric vehicles, and they want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy,\" Trump said. The attacks quicklygrew more personal. Musk called out Trump's \"ingratitude,\" arguing that Republicans would have lost the 2024 election without his support. Trump in response said Musk \"went crazy\" after being asked to leave his White House role, and he toyed with the idea ofsevering government tieswith Musk's companies. Musk replied by claiming Trump was in what are known as \"theEpstein Files,\" and said Trump's tariff policy would cause a recession. He also amplified a post calling for Trump to be impeached and replaced by Vice President JD Vance. A day after the barrage of attacks, Trump told reporters he's no longer thinking of Musk. \"Honestly, I’ve been so busy working on China, working on Russia, working on Iran, working on so many — I’m not thinking about Elon. You know, I just wish him well,\" he said.",

    "title": "California professor sues university over suspension for online comments on Gaza",
    "article_text": "A professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco filed a lawsuit Wednesday, alleging that the university violated her freedom of speech by suspending her for her online comments on Israel’s war in Gaza, according to court documents. Rupa Marya’s social media posts included expressing “solidarity with the hospitals and healthcare workers that Israel was attacking in Gaza,” according to court documents. The complaint stated that Marya “felt an obligation to speak out and did so using her X account.” Israel’s war in Gaza hasleft more than 52,000 people deadsince Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas militants killed 1,200 people in Israel and took 251 people hostage. Israel hasreceived intense criticismfrom around the world, including from the United Nations, for its actions in Gaza. “Firing Dr. Marya doesn’t only violate her right to free speech, it threatens all of us,” attorney Mark Kleiman said in a statement. “We all need to urgently speak up against these kinds of attacks on our basic rights to advocate for justice, and we expect the Court will agree with us that Dr. Marya’s rights have been violated and must be remedied.” Marya was placed on leave in September 2024 and her clinical privileges were suspended by the UCSF Executive Medical Board on Oct. 1. The board called her a “possible imminent danger” and cited social media posts, according to court documents. Her privileges were reinstated on Oct. 15. According to court documents, Marya received “rape and death threats” as well as “repeated harassment and threats” because of her posts, according to court documents. Before her suspension, Marya had several interactions with the university regarding her online activity. In November 2023, the dean of UCSF’s School of Medicine notified Marya that the school would be assessing whether her social media activity violated university policies. In response to one of Marya’s social media threads that went viral in January 2024, UCSFposted a statement regarding a circulating 'conspiracy theory.' “Although the statement did not name Dr. Marya, Dr. Robert Wachter acknowledged in an email that it was in direct response referring to Dr. Marya’s social media thread from January 2,” the complaint claimed. “UCSF’s January 6 statement accused Dr. Marya of promoting a ‘racist’ and ‘antisemitic’ ‘conspiracy theory.’” According to court documents, Marya’s posts \"never impeded the performance of her duties as a physician or faculty member, or the regular operation of the University.” “As a medical doctor, American citizen and as a person of South Asian descent raised in the Sikh religious tradition, Dr. Marya has long been concerned about American foreign policy, including in the Middle East and the issues surrounding the conflict between Israel and Palestine,” the complaint reads. “Her posts take aim at state policy and supremacist political ideologies, not at any religious or ethnic group.” A spokesperson for the University of California, San Francisco said that because of  privacy laws, the school is unable to comment on the lawsuit. Marya completed her residency in internal medicine at the University of California at San Francisco in 2007, was subsequently offered employment and joined the faculty. For the past five  years, however, Marya had no teaching duties and focused exclusively on patient care in the non-teaching hospital medicine services, according to court documents. Marya was also appointed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom to the Healthy California for All Commission in 2021, an initiative to advance a system for universal healthcare in the state.",

    "title": "Spanish Flamenco thrives in New Mexico, with its own unique flavor",
    "article_text": "By John Burnett Yjastros, the American Flamenco Repertory Company, performing in AlbuquerqueThais Coy/American Flamenco Repertory Companyhide caption A lot of folks know New Mexico for green chiles, the largest hot air balloon festival in the world, and the birthplace of the bomb. But it's also a global center of flamenco—the passionate dance, song and music of the Roma people of southern Spain. The epicenter is Albuquerque. New Mexico's largest city boasts aworld-famous flamenco festivalthat's coming up later this month. The University of New Mexico is the only American university that offers graduate and undergraduate Dance degrees with an emphasis in flamenco. TheNational Institute of Flamencois home to a world-class repertory company, and a conservatory that teaches students as young as three, to young adults who want to be professional dancers. The popularity of flamenco has exploded in the last four decades. You can find its distinctive percussive footwork from Tokyo to Israel to Toronto, throughout Latin America, and in Miami, New York, and San Francisco. But what's different about flamenco inNuevo Mexicois that it's homegrown. New Mexico traces its deeply Hispanic identity to the arrival of Spanish settlers 400-plus years ago. \"Here in New Mexico it's got to sound like us,\" says Vicente Griego, a celebrated singer from northern New Mexico who specializes incante jondo,the deep song of flamenco. \"There's other people who want to do flamenco exactly the way it's been done in Spain. But what makes us really special here and what keeps us honest, is that we have our own history. We've had our own resistance, our own celebration, our own liberation.\" Says Marisol Encinias, executive director of the National Institute of Flamenco: \"I like to think that there's something in our DNA that ties us to the antecedents of flamenco from way back.\" The renowned dancers, Maria Benitez and Vicente Romero, openedtablaos, or flamenco venues, in Santa Fe in the 1960s. At the same time, the Encinias family was establishing itself in Albuquerque. While there are regular flamenco performances in both cities today, Albuquerque is the hands-down flamenco capital. Eva Encinias, Marisol's mother, learned dance from her mother, Clarita, and is considered thegrande dameof flamenco in Albuquerque. Joaquin and Marisol Encinias, standing, mother Eva, sitting, the first family of flamenco in AlbuquerqueThaïs Coy/National Institute of Flamencohide caption \"Even though we present all of this very, very high-end flamenco, the rationale behind that is to inspire and cultivate young people,\" says Eva, sitting in the costume room of the National Institute of Flamenco that she founded 43 years ago. She's surrounded by racks of extravagantly ruffled dresses. \"We all started as children and we know the impact that flamenco had on us as young people.\" Outreach is a huge part of their mission. Between Eva and her children, Marisol and Joaquin, they've taught thousands of flamenco students at the Institute and at UNM. To that end, the Institute sends teachers into public schools across the state. \"We're gonna clap along to the music, in 4/4 time, which means that we count 1-2-3-4,\" intones Sarah Ward, a Canadian who became enthralled with flamenco and now teaches. She's leading a class of fourth-graders at the Taos Integrated School of the Arts. Fifteen kids happily stomp their sneakers to the count. Sarah Ward teaches flamenco at the Taos Integrated School of the ArtsMonica Ortiz Uribehide caption \"New Mexico is the best place to access flamenco outside of Spain,\" Ward says in an interview. \"It has such a rich cultural heritage here. We have grown it in the earth here as well and so it's very much a part of the New Mexican experience.\" One of her bright-eyed students is 10-year-old Cypress Musialowski. \"I feel an opportunity to let out anger,\" she says. \"I really like stomping my feet. But I also feel like I can just flow and be me.\" She adds, \"I love it, because in class I can't just stomp my feet. I'll get in trouble.\" Flamenco has been called performed aggression—the pounding wooden heels, the feral singing, the baroque guitarwork. The Spanish poet Federico Garcia Lorca definedduende, the spirit of flamenco, as \"tragedy-inspired ecstasy…a poetic emotion which is uncontrolled.\" And it's really hard to learn, says Marisol Encinias, who is also an assistant professor of flamenco dance at UNM. \"It's a really, really challenging artform,\" she says. \"I had a guitarist friend who said you spend your whole life trying to be mediocre.\" Evelyn Mendoza, the 27-year-old education manager at the Institute, says, \"I mean, you sweat your heart, soul, tears, blood and everything into any dance form that you do.\" While she has a bachelor's degree in contemporary dance from UNM, it was flamenco that captured her soul. \"But flamenco is so different because it's fierce.\" The fierceness, poetry and passion of flamenco will be celebrated June 20-28 atFestival Flamenco Alburquerque(the festival puts an extra R in Albuquerque to honor its original Spanish spelling),which isnow in its 38thyear.This year, fourteen of the world's best flamenco companies will perform on stages throughout Albuquerque for what is called the most celebrated flamenco festival outside of Spain. \"We're super blessed that they bring in these phenomenal artists  from Spain,\" says Noelia Encinias, the 30-year-old granddaughter of Eva. Now a rising professional dancer, Eva says she's been dancing flamenco \"since I was potty trained.\" \"Just being in Albuquerque you have such a vast knowledge base to pull from—the amazing artists from Spain, my peers, or watching kids taking beginning dance and remembering my basics.\" She adds, \"My cousin refers to it as the Disneyland of flamenco.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "With $2.7 billion settlement approved, college sports' big money era is officially here",
    "article_text": "Becky Sullivan Starting this fall, NCAA Division I schools will be able to pay players directly up to a salary cap of $20.5 million.Jae C. Hong/APhide caption A federal judge has approved the multibillion-dollar class-action legal settlement known asHouse v. NCAA, paving the way for a new era for college sports. Starting this fall, collegesand universities in the NCAA's top division will be allowed to directly pay athletes for the first time. Payments will be limited by a salary cap set initially at $20.5 million per school. And more than $2 billion will be paid out to former college athletes who were not allowed to earn money while they were in school. \"Despite some compromises, the settlement agreement nevertheless will result in extraordinary relief for members of the settlement classes,\" U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken wrote in Friday's order. The approval of the settlement \"marks a huge step forward for college sports,\"said NCAA President Charlie Baker. Direct payments to players, he added, \"is a tremendously positive change and one that was long overdue.\" For decades, college athletics were ruled by the tradition of amateurism, and NCAA rules banned schools from compensating players — called \"student-athletes\" by the NCAA — with anything beyond a scholarship that covered the costs of tuition and attending college. But the money in big-time college sports has grown exponentially over the past few decades. Top-level athletic departments rake in hundreds of millions of dollars from broadcast deals, ticket sales, donations and licensing agreements. \"The money became too big to not allow athletes to get a cut,\" said Noah Henderson, a one-time collegiate golfer who now directs the sports management program at Loyola University Chicago. TheHousesettlement arose out of three different lawsuits over the issue of compensation for collegiate athletes. The plaintiffs were a class of some 390,000 current and former college athletes, and the defendants were the NCAA and five of its athletic conferences. The negotiations took more than a year to complete. There are two major parts of theHousesettlement: one that looks backward, and one that looks forward. Looking backward, the NCAA and schools have agreed to pay $2.75 billion to former college athletes who played before 2021. That's the year the NCAA changed its rules to allow players to sign licensing agreements to earn money from their name, image and likeness rights, known as NIL. Men's football and basketball players will earn the largest payments, with prominent athletes who played at major schools earning as much as five or six figures. Going forward, the settlement puts in place a new system that will allow schools to pay players directly. Schools will be able to decide which players to pay and how much to pay them. It is expected that most of the compensation will be reserved for players in the sports that generate the most revenue for schools: primarily football, along with men's and women's basketball. The settlement also sets a salary cap. For each school, player compensation across all sports will count against a cap initially set at $20.5 million and that could rise as high as $33 million in 2035. Also new are roster limits, which replace the traditional scholarship limits for each sport. Schools may grant as many scholarships as they like, but team sizes are limited. Around half of the NCAA's 365 Division I schools are expected to adopt the new framework, either because their conferences — the SEC, ACC, Big Ten, Big 12 and PAC-12 — are named as defendants and they are required to comply with the settlement or because they are expected to opt in to its terms, according to court documents filed by lawyers negotiating the settlement. Some schools, particularly those in the lower football subdivision and those without football teams altogether, will opt out of the settlement and continue to compensate athletes only with scholarships and other costs of attendance. Since 2021, when the NCAA first allowed players to earn compensation from their name, image and likeness rights, NIL payments have become a de facto pay-to-play system. Star players, like Duke's basketball phenom Cooper Flagg, have earned millions of dollars on these deals. Another key part of the settlement takes aim at those supersized NIL deals by establishing a third-party clearinghouse to review licensing agreements for \"fair market value.\" That concept has been criticized by some in college sports. It is also likely to face legal challenges, said Sam Ehrlich, a professor at Boise State University who tracks college sports litigation. \"There's going to be significant questions moving forward as to what kind of powers that clearinghouse has and whether the clearinghouse is even legal,\" Ehrlich told NPR last month.

This most recent spate of encounters has become heated. \"It got out of control because of the way that they showed up,\" says San Diego council member Sean Elo-Rivera, referring to ICE agents conducting a raid on a local Italian restaurant. Members of the public surged around the agents, at one point surrounding their cars. The immigration authorities discharged flash-bangs, leading to a chaotic scene. Elo-Rivera posted a photo of federal agents dressed in tactical gear outside the restaurant, with the word \"TERRORISTS\" written over it. It drew an angryreaction from the Trump administration, but he says he believes the operation was meant to be intimidating. \"They wanted to make a show of it, so they did it on Friday night at dinnertime. They wanted to make a show of this so they showed up with assault rifles. They wanted to make a show of this so they showed up in far more numbers than they needed to,\" Elo-Rivera says. \"And the use of masks I think is incredibly concerning.\" ICE agents, as well as other federal agents delegated to work with ICE, are increasingly wearing masks during operations, somethingmany people find objectionable. But at a press conference on Monday, ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons said agents had good reasons to do so. \"People are out there taking photos of [agents'] names, their faces and posting them online with death threats to their family and themselves,\"Lyons says. \"So I'm sorry if people are offended by them wearing masks, but I'm not going to let my officers and agents go out there and put their lives on the line and their family on the line because people don't like what immigration enforcement is.\" At the same press conference, Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent in Charge for New England Michael Krol cautioned those who \"impede or obstruct operations or those who dare to threaten or assault our law enforcement officers,\" and he warned of potential investigations and prosecutions. But civil rights groups say bystanders have the right to observe, protest and shout questions. Kate Evans, director of theImmigrant Rights Clinic at Duke Law, says ICE agents don't necessarily have to answer questions from bystanders, but those questions can still be important. \"They're essentially functioning as kind of Fourth Amendment observers and informing the people who are actually the subject of the seizure — the arrest — that they have the right to request a warrant,\" Evans says. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents execute a criminal search warrant on May 30, 2025, at Buona Forchetta in San Diego, Calif.Lara McCaffrey/KPBShide caption She says one thing an observer can point out is that ICE agents need to show a judicial warrant — one signed by a judge, not just an ICE official — in order to enter a private space without permission. Agents have more latitude in public spaces. Evans says in order to arrest someone on civil immigration violations, agents should generally have an administrative warrant — the kind signed by ICE itself — showing the reason for the arrest. But in some circumstances, she says agents may also arrest someone if they have probable cause and reason to believe the person will get away. \"Immigration laws and regulations are not easily accessible for a lay person,\" Evans says. Adding to the confusion is the fact that sometimes, when ICE agents are spotted on operations, they're actually part of larger criminal investigations. That appears to have been the case in Minneapolis on Tuesday, when acrowd came out to protestwhat many assumed was an immigration raid at a taco restaurant, chanting \"Abolish ICE!\" Later, federal officials said it was a criminal investigation. \"The thing is, if you don't want to confuse people, why would you send ICE agents to the scene?\" asks Ryan Perez, who joined the crowd. Perez works with a nonprofit calledCOPAL, which trains \"constitutional observers\" to monitor ICE raids. Perez says the group is cautious, because sometimes people will mistakenly issue false alarms about ICE raids that are actually other kinds of law enforcement operations. At the same time, he says you have to understand people's response when heavily-armed ICE agents appear on the street. \"They intentionally brought armored vehicles in a residential area and a business corridor in front of, like, very high traffic areas. That's a stunt to me,\" Perez says of the operation on Tuesday. \"It just reminded me of the protests and the reactions of officers post-George Floyd. It brought me back to that moment.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Deportees are being held in a converted shipping container in Djibouti, ICE says",
    "article_text": "By Ximena Bustillo , Bill Chappell Camp Lemonnier uses stacks and rows of \"Containerized Living Units,\" or CLUs, which the military likens to shipping containers, to house thousands of personnel at the U.S. base in Djibouti. A group of migrants is being held in a converted shipping container, according to court filings.U.S. Navy photo / Screenshot by NPRhide caption A group of deported migrants is living in a converted shipping container at a U.S. military base in Djibouti, a country in East Africa, where they are guarded around the clock by a small team of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, according to a Thursdaycourt filing. Several migrants have been stuck at the base for more than two weeks, after the airplane they were on, which was originally bound for South Sudan,was rerouted mid-trip due to a federal judge's ruling. The court ruling came after multiple people facing deportation fought the Trump administration's effort to send them to South Sudan. Now, their casehas reached the Supreme Court, which could issue a ruling at any time. It's the latest example of migrants being caught in the legal crosshairs between Trump's efforts to streamline deportations and the courts' push for due process. Since the flight landed in Djibouti, ICE officers have been left with limited resources, and the migrants have been held with very limited communication with their families and no communication with their lawyers, according to the court filings. On Wednesday, lawyers for the migrants said some of the detainees were able to make contact with family members for the first time since being put on the flight on May 20. ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment on why the officers and migrants were still in Djibouti. In the Thursday court filing, Mellissa Harper, acting deputy executive associate director at ICE, said that the migrants are being held in a conference room in a converted Conex shipping container at Camp Lemonnier, a U.S. Naval Base. She said the ICE contingent includes 11officers assigned to guard the deportees, and two officers to support medical staff. The ICE personnel are working 12-hour shifts and Harper noted they \"do not have the capacity to maintain constant surveillance, custody, and care of the aliens for prolonged periods of time.\" Harper said in a sworn declaration that the daily temperature where the migrants are being held has exceeded 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The conference room where deportees are housed is \"not equipped nor suitable for detention of any length\" and ICE officers are sharing a small sleeping space with only six beds. Harper described a series of additional concerns including exposure to malaria and close proximity to \"burn pits\" — a method of disposing trash and human waste in the country, she wrote. She said the pits \"create a smog cloud\" that causes throat irritation and difficult breathing. She also said ICE officers and detainees complained of feeling ill within three days of their arrival to the base. Some officers have slept wearing N-95 masks, but access to medication is limited, she said. \"ICE officers continue to feel ill with symptoms such as coughing, difficulty breathing, fever, and achy joints,\" Harper said in her declaration. \"These symptoms align with bacterial upper respiratory infection, but ICE officers are unable to obtain proper testing for a diagnosis.\" Terrorist attacks, Harper said, are also a risk. Both the officers and detainees lack body armor and other gear in case of an attack from terrorists in Yemen, across the Gulf of Aden from Djibouti, she said. On May 20, news emerged that the U.S. wasmoving to deport a group of men, apparently to South Sudan. A Homeland Securityfilingin federal court in Massachusetts states that the deportees who were on the plane include two citizens of Cuba and two from Burma, along with natives of Laos, Mexico and Vietnam. All of the men have criminal records, according to the government's filings,and U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials have alleged that their home countries refused to take them back. On May 21, federal judge Brian Murphyordered that the migrants stay in DHS custody,instead of being released in South Sudan, in order for the department to give them more time to contest their deportation to the African country. Murphy did not specify in his order where geographically the detainees needed to be held, andthe deportation flight wound up in Djibouti. On May 27, Solicitor General D. John Sauerasked the Supreme Courtto place a stay on Murphy's injunction regarding deportations. Sauertold the high court on Thursdaythat the Trump administration was \"forced to establish a makeshift detention facility for dangerous criminals at a military base in Djibouti.\" The team of ICE officers that was originally assigned to the deportation mission was replaced and expanded on May 27, according to court filings. Camp Lemonnier spans nearly 500 acres, according to the U.S. military. It's located south of Djibouti–Ambouli International Airport.Google Maps / Screenshot by NPRhide caption Camp Lemonnier is the main base of operations for U.S. Africa Command in the Horn of Africa, according to the Navy. The facilityspans nearly 500 acresand supportsaround 4,000 personnel— a mix of U.S. and allied military and civilian staff. Service members stationed at the base are eligible for several pay increases.According to the Navy, personnel can receive \"imminent danger pay\" ($225 each month), which is associated with therisk of hostile fire, along with hardship duty pay ($100 a month). But the installation also includes aspects of everyday life in the U.S. It has a Pizza Hut, for instance, and a Planet Smoothie that's next to a gym. Two coffee shops are open 24 hours a day. Service members posted to the base live in \"Containerized Living Units,\" or CLUs, according tothe base's housing guide. Typically, each unit has a door and window, \"and a robust air conditioner,\" the guide states. \"The standard CLU is much like the shipping containers or CONEX boxes you might have seen being pulled by trucks or down at the port being loaded onto container ships,\" according to the guide. \"The CLUs can be stacked and arranged neatly to form their own sort of community here at the camp.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "Get all the help you need with today's Wordle. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Welcome to your firstWordlewin of the weekend. Keep it simple with an easy click through to the June 7 (1449) answer if you like, or relax, see how things go, and know that today's hint is here if you need it. Make sure you check out our general tips and tricks too—however you want to win, they can help get you there. I had a proper lightbulb moment today. Wordle didn't just give me enough clues to spot the answer (after perhaps a touch longer than I would have liked), but it gave me the pleasant surprise of instantly flipping from a state I'd describe as \"Please help, can someone explain words again?\" to an instant win. Well, it felt like an instant win after all the stumbling about that happened above it, anyway. When you take a cardboard delivery box and give it a second lease of life, you're doing this. Yes, there is a double letter in today's puzzle. A good starting word can be the difference between victory and defeat with the daily puzzle, but once you've got the basics, it's much easier to nail down those Wordle wins. And as there's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day, here are a few tips to help set you on the right path: There's no racing against the clock with Wordle so you don't need to rush for the answer. Treating the game like a casual newspaper crossword can be a good tactic; that way, you can come back to it later if you're coming up blank. Stepping away for a while might mean the difference between a win and a line of grey squares. Win the weekend. The answer to the June 7 (1449) Wordle isREUSE. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Past Wordle answers can give you some excellent ideas for fun starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. They are also a good way to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer is unlikely to be repeated. Here are some recent Wordle answers: Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day, and you'll need to work out which secret five-letter word is hiding inside them to keep up your winning streak. You shouldstart with a strong wordlike ARISE, or any other word that contains a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You'll also want to avoid starting words with repeating letters, as you're wasting the chance to potentially eliminate or confirm an extra letter. Once you hit Enter, you'll see which ones you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the dailyWordlepuzzle to give readers a hint each and every day. Her Wordle streak is truly mighty.

    "title": "'I'm not here to apologize but I am here to clarify': Splitgate 2 boss says his Make FPS Great Again hat is 'not a political statement'",
    "article_text": "The 1047 Games CEO wore the Trump slogan-parody hat on stage at Summer Game Fest. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Splitgate 2 launched a battle royale mode live at Summer Game Fest today. 1047 Games CEO and co-founder Ian Proulx took the stage himself to announce the news whileslamming the state of shooters. Almost immediately, reactions to the segment weren't as much about Splitgate 2 asProulx's peculiar fashion choice: a black \"MAKE FPS GREAT AGAIN\" hat. In response to negative reactions to the CEO's donning of the Trump slogan riff, Proulx said to take the hat at face value. \"I'm not here to apologize but I am here to clarify. This is not a political statement, it is quite literally what it says, so take it at face value,\" Proulxsaid via the official Splitgate X account. \"The state of multiplayer FPS games is tragically stale. We hope to fix that, whether you want Arena, Battle Royale, Onslaught, or Map Creator.\" Alongside the statement was a photo of a smiling Proulx with the MFPSGA hat and a thumbs up, which strikes me as a cavalier response to the suggestion from critics that invoking the decade's most politically-charged combination of words has significance beyond face value. Meanwhile, players were surprised to find that today's Splitgate 2 battle royale update also included ashop refresh with an $80 skin bundle, far in a way the most expensive item sold in the free-to-play FPS yet. An influx of Splitgate 2 players checking out the battle royale also caused XP to break again. 1047 says it's working on a fix.

    "title": "I can see why Devolver dedicated its whole show to Ball X Pit: It's like Atari's Breakout meets Vampire Survivors and the demo is curing my roguelike fatigue",
    "article_text": "Ball X Pit is the latest slice of zany genre riffage published by Devolver Digital. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If you're anything like me, a Gen Z caffeine addict with the attention span of a fruit fly, ancient classics like Pong and Breakout don't do much for you. 'How am I supposed to play this without roguelite elements and heaps of stacking upgrades?' I cry, and if the lesson is that sometimes less is more, an hour with Ball X Pit has made sure I may never learn it. Sometimes more is more, and it rules. Devolver dedicated its Summer Game Fest show to Ball X Pit, a brick-breaker turbocharged with new twists, and I was able to try a demo of it before the reveal. Skeleton soldiers in the form of blocks and rectangles march down a vertical column trying to shoot you and reach the bottom, while you run around automatically firing balls which bounce around and deal damage. If you catch the balls mid-flight, they immediately shoot out wherever you're aiming. There's already some depth there: you can aim wide to take down a whole group with ricochets, or get up in an enemy's face and rapidly bat the ball back at them to focus one down. The fun really starts, though, when you start leveling up and racking up special balls. Between a broodmother ball that \"births\" more balls as it flies around, a burn ball that lights enemies ablaze, and a midnight oil ball that turns burning enemies into living bombs, and all sorts of colorful alternatives, Ball X Pit goes from stark simple to nigh-unreadable chaos in a matter of minutes. Each special ball gets added to your arsenal and comes with its own suite of upgrades and potential fusions with other special balls; before long, you're making split-second decisions in a sea of automatic laser fire and screen-coating explosions. Boss enemies will DPS check your build as the skeleton hordes get tougher and more numerous, and I was constantly itching to level up just one more time, get a little bit stronger, so I could live a few dozen seconds longer. In-between runs, you hurry back to New Ballbylon (yes, really) and spend whatever cash you earned on the meta progression stuff. New buildings, new playable characters, new potential builds for future runs, and so on. The structure is nothing unusual, but I still walked away from the demo pretty taken with what I played—which speaks to the sheer, twitchy fun this game finds in its ball-bouncing brick breaking. Frankly, I thought I was getting tired of the roguelike formula, and Ball X Pit packs in a lot of concepts you have seen before. But the action in its demo is so breakneck, such a potent distillation of that power-scaling madness I love in games like Risk of Rain, I came crawling back to the play button after seeing what the demo had to offer. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "'No one cooks anymore': Dosa Divas is an RPG about food, death, and big robots",
    "article_text": "You know, the classic videogame themes. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Outerloop's previous RPG,Thirsty Suitors, featured an elaborate cooking minigame—complete with quick-time-event handwashing—where you had to prepare Indian cuisine as a way of impressing and subsequently bonding with your mother. What I'm saying is, they've got prior when it comes to games where food is important. Outerloop's next RPG, shown off today on the Day of the Devs stream following theSummer Game Festshow, takes the cooking and makes it central. Dosa Divas pits you against a fast-food corporation called LinaMeals who serve food in plastic tubes to a pacified population. As one of the heroes sadly puts it, \"No one cooks anymore.\" I'm getting JojaMart vibes. To defeat LinaMeals you have to gather ingredients and cook meals, both to serve local villagers who are starved for food that's been made with love and care, and to physically assault the goons of the LinaMeals corporation with. There's a whole JRPG-style system of menu combat, and each enemy has an elemental weakness—a flavor craving—that can be set off by attacking them with the right kind of food, triggering a status effect called \"Stuffed\". You can also hit them with weapons made out of cooking implements, with two of the trailer's featured protagonists wielding a spatula-nunchuck and a shield made out of a barbecue lid. The third protagonist is basically a Transformer. Yeah, if you thought Dosa Divas was done being weird it's got a ways to go yet. Your partner in cooking is a robot \"spirit-mech\" called Goddess who communicates in emoticons and who you can ride around in between battles. She's got a double-jump and a grappling hook for when she's not Naruto-running across the land. Another odd ingredient in Dosa Divas is one that's only hinted at in the trailer. Creative director Chandana Ekanayake sums up the gameloop like this: \"Platform through vibrant villages, battle corporate goons, reconcile with loved ones, and eat one last meal together before saying goodbye.\" I'm sorry, what was that last bit? The tagline is \"One last meal\" and apparently one of the themes Dosa Divas explores is death, so I guess this is an RPG about cooking and robot-platforming that is also about sharing final meals with your family and friends. Which sounds kind of heavy, but in a filling way. I liked Thirsty Suitors a lot so I'm intrigued by Dosa Divas. It's got robot crabs too, did I mention the robot crabs? It'll be out in early 2026 and you can wishlist it onSteam.

    "title": "PC finally has its own Breath of the Wild killer, and it's indistinguishable from the Nintendo game except that you are a boy who is also a tire",
    "article_text": "You'd have to get up pretty early in the morning to spot the difference between Tire Boy and TOTK. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Beneath my television sits a small, underpowered rectangle. It's called the 'Nintendo Switch' and I purchased it—in its advanced, glowing OLED form—to play Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom. That is its sole purpose—filling that single hole in my PC's gaming library (yes, yes, I know you can black-magic your way to Zelda on PC, but consider that I am very lazy and stupid). Except maybe that hole isn't there anymore. Maybe we've finally got Breath of the Wild on PC—truly on PC—with the advent of Tire Boy. It's a game where you roam windswept, verdant plains, make prominent use of a glider, and help the world's strange denizens with their travails and woes. Plus, you are a boy that is also a tire. That's also a factor. Revealed at Day of the Devs, Tire Boy looks very much like Link got into a horrible accident at an autobody shop. You play a boy who is, for about ⅔ of himself, simply a boy. He has all the normal boy accoutrements: arms, legs, a t-shirt. And then where his head should be, his neck instead resolves into a great tractor tire, looping out of his esophagus and connecting between his feet, just above ground level, in a neat 360. Which is the stuff of nightmares, of course, but I have to admit the whole thing looks quite charming, especially when you hear its very amiable devs chat about it excitedly. \"Tire Boy is fast and nimble,\" declares the studio, which seems unlikely to me. If I were a boy that was also a tire, I think I'd be taking some serious hits to my dexterity, and yet there he is, doing battle with giant toad-monsters and rolling gaily across the countryside like it's actually regular humans that are badly designed ones. It's aggressively Breath of the Wild-flavoured, which I mean only as a compliment, but looks infused with enough imaginative weirdness to make it definitively its own thing. Your main quest is all about repairing a huge radio transmitter to get in touch with lost travellers, for instance. Plus, on top of being a boy that is a tire, Tire Boy spent his childhood being raised by a large owl named Nestwijk, and it sounds like figuring out why your head is a tire—what happened to your family of presumably also tire-headed kin—will be a lynchpin of the game's story. At one point Tire Boy picks up an acoustic guitar while roaming the open world. I'm not going anywhere with that observation, I just wanted to make you aware of it. I'm into it, even if my Switch is now more obsolete than ever, and I will be linking up (get it? Like the Zelda guy) with Tire Boy as soon as he arrives at an undefined point in the future.

    "article_text": "Be careful where you drive on Arrakis. Be careful where you do anything on Arrakis, really. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I'm an explorer at heart. Give me a big open world map and yes, I'll harvest resources and craft gear and build a base—but what I really want to do is get out and see the world. I'm about 10 hours into survival MMO Dune: Awakening, I've got a snug little base, a couple flasks of water, and a fully-fuelled sandbike, so I thought I'd do a bit of exploring today. I jumped on my bike, pointed myself toward the horizon, and floored it—and immediately got stuck in a massive pit of quicksand. Roadtrip cancelled! Also: life cancelled. This was my first encounter with quicksand and it wasn't exactly a surprise. I knew there were quicksand pits in the region because they're very helpfully marked on the map. In fact, I opened my map to see where the quicksand was, which accomplished two things. First, it showed me I had already driven directly into the middle of the quicksand, and second, it slowed me down because you can't look at your map and maintain bike speed at the same time. Here, see it for yourself: I might have made it if I hadn't slowed down, but now I was properly stuck. I tried the only move I had: flooring my bike and chanting \"No, no, no.\" Strangely, that didn't work. So, I continued doing it for about another twenty to thirty seconds, while slowly sinking deeper. That's when the sandworm appeared, breaching the dunes right behind me. I am terrified of sandworms because when they swallow you, they swallow all of your gear and you lose it forever. It's theworst way to die in Dune: Awakening: your bike, your weapons, your armor, everything you've got with you is permanently gone. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. So, I leapt into action… by continuing to floor it and chant \"No, no, no.\" Still didn't work. Finally, I had a bit of luck: my bike exploded and I was killed instantly! Hooray! I know, it doesn't sound like something to celebrate, but dying by exploding bike meant I wasn't killed by the sandworm. I may have lost a few resources from my backpack, but I didn't get swallowed, so I still had all my weapons and armor and tools. Is that a viable strategy if you're stuck in quicksand? Exploding? I'm not sure, but it's all I've got to work with right now, and I was afraid if I jumped off and ran my boots would sink into the sand, too. My plan is to stop exploring and get to work on crafting an ornithopter so I can just fly over this scary desert instead of driving on top of it. I did have to build a new bike, and I couldn't collect my dropped items (I wouldn't have tried anyway), but at least my lack of caution resulted in me happily dying in a vehicle explosion. Believe me, there are worse ways to go in Arrakis.

    "title": "To be a master heister in Thick as Thieves, Warren Spector's 'player-powered' multiplayer Thief successor, the devs say you'll have to 'play with your ears'",
    "article_text": "If your heist is about to go loud, make sure there's something louder nearby. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. At today's Day of the Devs showcase, immersive sim luminary Warren Spector presented the latest on Thick as Thieves, the upcoming multiplayer Thief successor from Spector's studio, Otherside Entertainment. Spector calls Thick as Thieves a \"player-powered\" immersive sim, where the flow of a match is determined by how your rival thieves are manipulating the game's systems to their own ends. Revealed back in 2024, Thick as Thieves is a PvPvE first-person stealth game pitting you against rival Thieves Guild members as you race through a dense, intricate turn-of-the-century city to be the first to pilfer a prized item. Otherside says it's got \"all the bells and whistles\" of its immersive sim forebears, like hiding in shadows and timing your movements with internalized NPC pathing and vision cones. The \"x-factor,\" Otherside says, is multiplayer. No matter how much you memorize NPC behavior and level geometry, your heist plans can only be so perfect when another player might sprint by and club you senseless. According to Otherside, a core design pillar for Thick as Thieves is \"play with your ears,\" meaning audio design is a crucial component of providing players with information for pulling off their skulduggery. And those sounds won't just tell you when a guard's walking down the corridor or rival thieves are tussling outside. Audio is a tool for you to use, too: Otherside says you can use loud sounds like thunderstorms and passing trains to cover the noises of your lockpicking, glass-breaking, and general cutpursery. That changing audio landscape is just one way that each Thick as Thieves match will differ from the next. Weather conditions will vary from game to game; shops that were closed in your last game might be open in the next. And each thief is pursuing their own quest objectives, seeding interconnecting webs of chaos across each other's schemes. We've been eagerly waiting for a chance to try it out since our lengthyThick as Thieves previewlast year. If you're just as eager to play, you might have a chance soon: Otherside istaking playtest sign-ups now.

    "title": "Popular weight loss drug could cause sudden blindness – EU’s health watchdog",
    "article_text": "The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has concluded that semaglutide-based medications – including Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus – increase the risk of a serious eye condition that can lead to sudden vision loss. Following a comprehensive safety review, the EMA’s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC)determinedon Friday that non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) should be listed as a“very rare”side effect of semaglutide – the main component of weight-loss and anti-diabetic drugs produced by Novo Nordisk. The EU health watchdog’s review, initiated in January 2025, analyzed data from clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, and medical literature. Findings suggest that adults with type 2 diabetes taking semaglutide have approximately twice the risk of developing NAION compared to those not on the medication. The“very rare”side effect classification indicates that the condition may affect up to 1 in 10,000 users. NAION is the second most common cause of optic nerve-related blindness after glaucoma. Patients experiencing sudden vision loss or rapidly worsening eyesight while on semaglutide are advised to seek immediate medical attention and discontinue use if NAION is diagnosed. The Denmark-based company Novo Nordisk owns the patent on semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist used for managing type 2 diabetes and obesity. It functions by enhancing insulin secretion and promoting a feeling of fullness, thereby aiding in blood sugar control and weight management. A recent study also indicated that Ozempic and similar medications may increase the risk ofkidney cancer. However, the drugs reportedly lower the risk of more than a dozen other cancers, suggesting their overall benefit may still outweigh the hazards. Additionally, the EMA previously investigated reports of suicidal thoughts associated with semaglutide use, though no definitive causal relationship was established. The EMA’s recommendations will now be reviewed by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) before a final decision is adopted by the European Commission. Novo Nordisk, which was dethroned as Europe’smost valuable companyearlier this year, has stated its commitment to patient safety and is working with the EMA to update product labels accordingly.",

Given the limited space and narrow access roads, large gatherings could present safety concerns. We kindly request that fans avoid going to the bases.\" Korean fans needn't fret.Just days after their discharge, the band, with the exception of Suga, will be celebrating their 12thanniversary on June 13 with The 2025 BTS Festa at Kintex in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province, from June 13 to 14.

(Photo: REUTERS/Issei Kato) TOKYO: Japan had made some progress in a fifth round oftrade talkswith United States officials aimed at ending tariffs that arehurting Japan's economy,Tokyo's chief tariff negotiator said. \"Tariffs have already been imposed on autos, auto parts, steel and aluminum, and some of them have doubled to 50 per cent along with 10 per cent general tariff. These are causing daily losses to Japan's economy,\" Ryosei Akazawa, said in Washington on Friday (Jun 6) after talks with officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Akazawa, a minister in charge of economic revitalisation, declined to say what progress they had made.

North Korea's entire internet infrastructure is not showing up on systems that can monitor internet activities, he said. \"Hard to say if this is intentional or accidental - but seems like this is internal rather than an attack,\" he said.

    "title": "Abrego Garcia, mistakenly deported, is returned to US to face migrant smuggling charges",
    "article_text": "World World Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant who lived in the US legally with a work permit and was erroneously deported to El Salvador, is seen wearing a Chicago Bulls hat, in this handout image obtained by Reuters on Apr 9, 2025. (File photo: Reuters/Abrego Garcia Family/Handout) WASHINGTON: Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the man mistakenly deported from Maryland to El Salvador by the Trump administration, was flown back to the United States to face criminal charges of transporting illegal immigrants within the country, Attorney General Pam Bondi said on Friday (Jun 6). Abrego Garcia's return marks a turning point in a case that became a flashpoint for critics of President Donald Trump's aggressive immigration policies, who pointed to it as asign that the administration was disregarding civil libertiesin its push to step up deportations. The 29-year-old Salvadoran, whose wife and young child in Maryland are US citizens, appeared in federal court in Nashville on Friday evening. His arraignment was set for Jun 13, when he will enter a plea, according to local media reports. Until then, he will remain in federal custody. If he is convicted, he would be deported to El Salvador after serving his sentence, Bondi said. The Trump administration has said Abrego Garcia was a member of the MS-13 gang, an accusation that his lawyers deny. Officials on Friday portrayed the indictment of Abrego Garcia by a grand jury in Tennessee as vindication of their approach to immigration enforcement. \"The man has a horrible past and I could see a decision being made, bring him back, show everybody how horrible this guy is,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, adding that it was the US Justice Department that decided to bring Abrego Garcia back. According to the indictment, Abrego Garcia worked with at least five co-conspirators as part of a smuggling ring to bring immigrants to the US illegally, and then transport them from the US-Mexico border to other destinations in the country. Abrego Garcia often picked up migrants in Houston, and made more than 100 trips between Texas and Maryland between 2016 and 2025, the indictment said. The indictment also alleges Abrego Garcia transported firearms and drugs. According to the indictment, one of Abrego Garcia's co-conspirators belonging to the same ring was involved in the transportation of migrants whose tractor trailer overturned in Mexico in 2021, resulting in 50 deaths. Abrego Garcia's lawyer, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, called the criminal charges \"fantastical\" and a \"kitchen sink\" of allegations. \"This is all based on the statements of individuals who are currently either facing prosecution or in federal prison,\" he said. \"I want to know what they offered those people.\" Abrego Garcia wasdeported on Mar 15, more than two months before the charges were filed. He was briefly held in a mega-prison known as the Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT), despite an immigration judge's 2019 order barring him from being sent to El Salvador because he would likely be persecuted by gangs. At a press conference, Bondi said Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele had agreed to return Abrego Garcia after US officials presented his government with an arrest warrant. \"The grand jury found that over the past nine years, Abrego Garcia has played a significant role in an alien smuggling ring,\" Bondi said at a press conference. In a court filing on Friday, federal prosecutors asked a judge to have Abrego Garcia detained pending trial. They said Abrego Garcia got into MS-13 in El Salvador by murdering a rival gang member's mother, citing a co-conspirator whom they did not name. The indictment did not charge Abrego Garcia with murder. If convicted, Abrego Garcia could face 10 years in prison for each migrant he transported, prosecutors said. That means he could be locked away for the rest of his life, they said. The case has become a symbol of escalating tensions between the Trump administration and the judiciary, which has blocked a number of the president's signature policies. More recently, the US Supreme Court has backed Trump's hardline approach to immigration in other cases. After his lawyers challenged the basis for his deportation, the US Supreme Courtordered the Trump administrationto facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, with liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor saying the government had cited no basis for what she called his \"warrantless arrest\". US District Judge Paula Xinis has opened a probe into what, if anything, the Trump administration had done to secure his return, after his lawyers accused officials of stonewalling their requests for information. That led to concerns among Trump's critics that his administration would openly defy court orders. In a court filing on Friday, Justice Department lawyers told Xinis that Abrego Garcia's return meant they were in compliance with the order to facilitate his return. Sandoval-Moshenberg said Abrego Garcia's return did not mean the government was in compliance, asserting that his client must be placed in immigration proceedings before the same judge who handled his 2019 case. Chris Van Hollen, a Democratic senator from Maryland who visited Abrego Garcia in El Salvador, said in a statement on Friday that the Trump administration has \"finally relented to our demands for compliance with court orders and the due process rights afforded to everyone in the United States\". \"The administration will now have to make its case in the court of law, as it should have all along,\" Van Hollen said.

    "article_text": "Business Business FILE PHOTO: A satellite model is placed on EchoStar Satellite Services logo in this picture illustration taken April 4, 2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo EchoStar is considering a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing as the telecommunications services firm vies to shield its cache of wireless spectrum licenses from the threat of revocation by federal regulators, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter. The company declined to comment on the report. Last month, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) notified EchoStar it was investigating the company's compliance with certain federal obligations to provide 5G service in the U.S., questioning EchoStar's buildout extension and mobile-satellite service. FCC's actions have severely limited the company's ability to make strategic decisions regarding the growth and investment of its Boost Mobile business, according to a regulatory filing by the company last month. EchoStar has previously disclosed that it missed roughly $500 million in interest payments, citing uncertainty around the ongoing FCC review. U.S. satellite TV provider DirecTV terminated its agreement to acquire EchoStar's satellite television business last year, which includes rival Dish TV, over a failed debt-exchange offer.

Newell's, the Rosario club that once nurtured a young Lionel Messi, suspended the academy players from training and revoked their scholarships for three months after discovering their photo with Malcorra, who has played for bitter rivals Rosario Central during five seasons. The decision, which club officials framed as a protective measure following reported fan threats, has drawn strong criticism from both the public and prominent figures, while Malcorra himself expressed his dismay at the row. \"I feel sad for them. Children are innocent and don't know much about what they're doing,\" Malcorra told reporters on Friday, recounting the chance encounter at a youth tournament three months ago.

The incident came to light on Friday after the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department last month implemented a raft of measures to prevent the employment of unqualified lifeguards at private swimming pools. The department checked a batch of lifeguard records with the Hong Kong China Life Saving Society that day and found that the credentials of an attendant who was on duty earlier in the week at the swimming pool in San Francisco Towers did not match official records. “As the qualification of the life-saving attendant is in doubt and the swimming pool has allegedly failed to provide a sufficient number of qualified life-saving attendants as required by law, the department has ordered the immediate closure of the pool and is considering prosecuting its licensee,” the department said on Friday evening. “The incident has been reported to police, and the [department] has also notified the Property Management Services Authority to take parallel follow-up action.” San Francisco Towers is a high-end, two-block private estate on 29-35 Ventris Road.",

On Saturday, tear gas was deployed near Home Depot inParamount, California, where Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers were allegedly conducting a raid. Following the raid, a violent protest broke out and several arrests were made for assault on a federal agent, according to U.S. Border Patrol Chief Michael W. Banks. President Donald Trump took to Truth Social to call out state and local leadership's inaction. \"If Governor Gavin Newscum, of California, and Mayor Karen Bass, of Los Angeles, can't do their jobs, which everyone knows they can't, then the Federal Government will step in and solve the problem, RIOTS & LOOTERS, the way it should be solved!!!\" Trump wrote.

    "article_text": "Fox News’ Alex Hogan reports on one of the largest Russian attacks on Ukraine since the war began. At least four people were killed ineastern Ukraineand more than two dozen were injured, including a baby and a 14-year-old, after Russia launched drone-and-missile and bomb attacks Saturday, Ukraine officials said. Russia launched 215 missiles and drones on Kharkiv, the war-torn nation’s second-largest city, in the early hours of Saturday, killing three people and wounding more than 40 others, Ukrainian officials said. Later in the day,Russia droppedbombs on Kharkiv’s city center, killing at least one more person and injuring five. \"What the Russians want is the complete destruction of life,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday after the attacks. TRUMP SUGGESTS TAKING A STEP BACK FROM UKRAINE PEACE TALKS The aftermath of a Russian attack that hit a residential building in Kharkiv, Ukraine, Saturday, June 7, 2025.(AP Photo/Andrii Marienko) \"In more than 11 years of Russia’s war against Ukraine, they have brought only one new thing to our land, the most widespread Russian ‘legacy,’ ruins and death,\" Zelenskyy added. \"We must continue resisting this. I thank everyone around the world who is helping. The Russians are preparing to continue the war and are ignoring all peace proposals. They must be held accountable.\" Zelenskyy said Ukraine would work to strengthen its air defense, adding, \"We urgently need positive signals from the United States regarding air defense systems. We are still waiting for a response to our request to purchase systems that can help.\" He also thanked other European countries for sending supplies. \"We must also achieve results in joint production of air defense systems and missiles. This is absolutely essential for our whole Europe,\" he added. \"Only time separates us from that result, and what matters most is shortening that time.\" Rescuers carry a wounded woman after a Russian attack that hit a residential building in Kharkiv, Ukraine, Saturday, June 7, 2025.(AP Photo/Andrii Marienko) \"This is another savage killing,\" he wrote on X along with graphic photos of some of the injured. \"Aerial bombs were dropped on civilians in the city — there is even a children’s railway nearby. This makes no military sense.\" He called the attack \"pure terrorism. And this has been going on for more than three years of the full-scale war. This cannot be ignored. This cannot be turned a blind eye to. And this is not some kind of game. Every day, we lose our people only because Russia feels it can act with impunity. Russia must be firmly forced into peace.\" RUSSIA LAUNCHES LARGEST AERIAL ATTACK OF UKRAINE WAR, KILLING AT LEAST 12 Last Sunday, Ukrainelaunched a surprise drone attackon Russian territory that destroyed 40 Russian planes, according to Kyiv. In his evening address, Zelenskyy said 117 drones had been used in the operation. He claimed the operation was headquartered out of an office next to the local FSB, the Russian intelligence agency.

The attack came after President Donald Trump had a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin in which the Russian leader said he planned to retaliate. Trump responded to the attacks Friday, telling reporters on Air Force One, \"Well, they gave Putin a reason to go in and bomb the hell out of them last night. … When I saw it, I said, ‘Here we go, now it’s going to be a strike.’\" On Thursday, Trump alsocompared the Russia-Ukrainewar to children.

    "article_text": "Check out the best moments between the Boston Red Sox and the Atlanta Braves. Alex Bregmanmay not be available to play for the Boston Red Sox right now, but that didn’t stop him from trying to inspire an offensive rally Friday night. It was with his mustache, not his bat. Baseball players are some of the most superstitious athletes in the world, and Bregman illustrated that during a game against theNew York Yankeeson the road. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Boston Red Sox third baseman Alex Bregman participates in media day at JetBlue Park at Fenway South Feb. 18, 2025.(Nathan Ray Seebeck/Imagn Images) TheRed Soxentered the game having lost six of their previous nine games, and they found themselves in a hole after Walker Buehler gave up seven runs in the first two innings of the game. Bregman tried to rally his teammates by heading into the clubhouse and returning to the dugout with a clean shave. He shaved off his mustache in the middle of the game in hopes it would be a spark for his squad. Bregman, who is dealing with a quad injury that has him on the 10-day IL, seemed to help in some respect. The Red Sox got on the board with a home run from rookie Marcelo Mayer, who was recently called up from Triple-A, and they scored three more runs in the sixth inning to make it 8-4. RED SOX OUTFIELDERS COMBINE TO MAKE MIRACULOUS CATCH In the top of the seventh inning, Rafael Devers, labeled a Yankees killer in his Red Sox career, launched a two-run homer to cut the lead to 9-6 in favor of the home team. Bregman’s quick action to shave off his ‘stache wasn’t the magic potion needed for an all-time comeback. Yankees closer Devin Williams shut the door on Boston’s comeback hopes in the top of the ninth inning to come away with the first victory in this weekend series. Boston Red Sox third baseman Alex Bregman bats against the Detroit Tigers during the first inning at Comerica Park in Detroit May 14, 2025.(Imagn.) Boston was supposed to be a team poised for the playoffs in 2025, but injuries and inconsistent play have them five games under .500. They sit fourth in the AL East, while the Yankees are five games ahead of the Toronto Blue Jays in first place in the division. Bregman, though, has enjoyed his new home in Boston, joining the Red Sox this offseason after nine seasons with the Houston Astros. Bregman is slashing .299/.385/.553 with a .938 OPS, 11 homers, 17 doubles and 35 RBIs in 51 games this season. But it isn’t offense that has been hurting the Red Sox. It’s pitching.

Asked how it happened, Romano explained she was not \"at liberty to say specifics,\" according to People. The actress previously revealed on Instagram that she was \"hit in five places,\" including below her eye. CHRISTY CARLSON ROMANO ‘SHOT IN THE EYE’ DURING CLAY PIGEON SHOOTING OUTING WITH HER HUSBAND FOR HIS BIRTHDAY Romano shared details for the first time about what transpired. \"It’s a birdshot that got sprayed in my direction by another party, and essentially it was within 200 feet, which means really fast and hot,\" she told hosts Neen Williams and Frankland Lee.

She remembered that Rooney rushed to her aid and had to restrain himself from retaliating against the other party. \"So, he’s running to me and making sure I’m OK, and he’s fighting the urge to hurt the person … but he’s been practicing stoicism recently, and there was something in him,\" Romano recalled. \"He was immediately into action mode, evaluating me and ran to get the car. \"I felt this huge rush that I’d never felt before where I was starting to get really woozy.

    "title": "How Justice Clarence Thomas led SCOTUS to kill DEI",
    "article_text": "Fox News chief legal correspondent Shannon Bream has the latest on Supreme Court rulings tackling issues such as reverse discrimination, Mexican drug cartels and more on ‘Special Report.’ Clarence Thomas has spent his professional life trying to return American law to the Declaration of Independence’s founding promise that individuals should bejudged as individualsrather than as members ofracial, gender, or ethnic groups. It seems that his peers on the high court have been listening. Thomas' belief in individual rights precedes his time on the court. For example, in a 1985 law review article, Thomas discussed his daily responsibilities of enforcing the nation’s civil rights laws as chairman of the EEOC. He wrote: \"I intend to take EEO enforcement back to where it started by defending the rights of individuals who are hurt by discriminatory practices. … Those who insist on arguing that the principle of equal opportunity, the cornerstone of civil rights, means preferences for certain groups have relinquished their roles as moral and ethical leaders in this area.\" SUPREME COURT RULES UNANIMOUSLY IN FAVOR OF STRAIGHT OHIO WOMAN WHO CLAIMED DISCRIMINATIONJustice Thomas has reiterated that American law protects individual rather than groups rights throughout his three-and-a-half decades on the nation’s highest court. In 1995's Missouri v. Jenkins, for instance, Thomas became the first Supreme Court justice to directly criticize Brown v. Board of Education (1954). Although he called state-mandated segregation \"despicable,\" he said that the Court was wrong in 1954 to rely on disputable social science evidence to declare segregation unconstitutional rather than invoking the \"constitutional principle\" that \"the government must treat citizens as individuals, and not as members of racial, ethnic or religious groups.\" A close friend of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas believes it’s absurd that Democrats and media members are trying to pressure him to recuse himself from deciding whether former President Trump should be removed from Colorado's primary ballot.(Drew Angerer/Getty Images) Justice Thomas has made similar pronouncements in many other judicial opinions. His concurring opinion in 2007's Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1 is perhaps the strongest articulation of his conception of equality: \"The dissent attempts to marginalize the notion of a colorblind Constitution by consigning it to me and Members of today’s plurality. … But I am quite comfortable in the company I keep. My view of the Constitution is Justice Harlan’s view in Plessy: ‘Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.’\"More recently, Justice Thomas wrote in a concurring opinion in the Supreme Court’s 2023 decisions holding that colleges and universities cannot consider race in admissions decisions that \"While I am painfully aware of the social and economic ravages which have befallen my race and all who suffer discrimination, I hold out enduring hope that this country will live up to its principles so clearly enunciated in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States: that all men are created equal, are equal citizens, and must be treated equally before the law.\" Associate Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson authored the opinion in Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services.(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File ) Last week’s Supreme Court decision in Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services signals that proponents of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs should stop pretending that they are complying with the law. After all, one of the most liberal members of the Court, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, wrote in an  opinion for a unanimous Court that the \"background circumstances\" rule imposed by several lower courts of appeal requiring members of a majority group to satisfy a heightened evidentiary standard to prevail on a Title VII discrimination claim is inconsistent with the text of Title VII and the Supreme Court’s anti-discrimination precedents. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONJustice Jackson’s opinion for the Court reversing the lower courts might as well have been penned by Justice Thomas himself. Justice Jackson quoted the text of Title VII that makes it illegal to take an adverse employment action against \"any individual.\" She further quoted a 2020 Supreme Court decision, Bostock v. Clayton County, that held that the \"law’s focus on individuals rather than groups [is] anything but academic.\" She added: \"By establishing the same protections for every ‘individual’—without regard to that individual’s membership in a minority or majority group—Congress left no room for courts to impose special requirements on majority-group plaintiffs alone.\"Justice Thomas joined Justice Jackson’s opinion for the Court \"in full.\" But he also issued a concurring opinion in which he suggested that the \"background circumstances\" rule is not only inconsistent with the statutory text of Title VII but is \"plainly at odds with the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection.\" Most important for present purposes, Thomas made clear that if proponents of DEI are hoping that the Ames decision has nothing to do with their DEI programs, they are sorely mistaken. \"American employers have long been ‘obsessed’ with ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ initiatives and affirmative action plans,\" he wrote. \"Initiatives of this kind have often led to overt discrimination against those perceived to be in the majority.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPWhen Justice Antonin Scalia died in 2016, Court watchers openly speculated about who would replace him as the intellectual leader of the conservative legal movement. Clarence Thomas has unquestionably filled that role. After all, in Ames even Justice Thomas’s liberal colleagues on the nation’s highest court conceded that American law protects individual rather than group rights.

Multiple people were detained by immigration agents on Friday as seven locations inLos Angeleswere raided. In response, violent protests broke out across the county, including an attempted break into the Roybal Federal Building.

Rory McIlroy might have some serious driver troubles heading into next week’sU.S. Open. The 2025 Masters winner missed the cut by 12 strokes at the RBC Canadian Open, shooting an 8-over 78 on Friday, which was his second-highest score in anyPGA Tourevent for his career. The last time McIlroy shot a 78 was in the first round of The Open in 2024. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Rory McIlroy hits his tee shot on the eighth hole during the second round of the RBC Canadian Open golf tournament.(Dan Hamilton-Imagn Images) McIlroy said his round \"concerns me,\" and what professional golfer wouldn’t be worried after carding a quadruple bogey as well as one double bogey and four bogeys to go with just two birdies. \"You don’t want to shoot high scores like the one I did today,\" McIlroy said,per ESPN. \"Still, I felt like I came here obviously with a new driver thinking that that sort of was going to be good and solve some of the problems off the tee, but it didn’t.\" RORY MCILROY DEFENDS RIGHT TO SKIP MEDIA SESSIONS AFTER NONCONFORMING DRIVER NEWS LEAKED AT PGA CHAMPIONSHIP McIlroy’s driver has been a point of emphasis since the PGA Championship last month, where it was leaked that he had a nonconforming driver that was unusable after pre-tournament testing. Scottie Scheffler, the winner at Quail Hollow Club that week, also had a nonconforming driver, but his name wasn’t publicly known. However, McIlroy was ticked off his name got out there, and he skipped media sessions the entire tournament. He went on to finish T-47th. Before teeing off this week in Toronto, McIlroy admitted being upset that his driver conundrum had been made public. Rory McIlroy reacts after playing a bunker shot on the first hole during the second round of the RBC Canadian Open golf tournament.(Dan Hamilton-Imagn Images) \"I was a little p----d off because I knew that Scottie’s driver had failed on Monday, but my name was the one that was leaked,\" McIlroy said in a press conference, viaThe New York Post.\"It was supposed to stay confidential. Two members of the media were the ones that leaked it. \"I didn’t want to get up there and say something that I regretted either, because I’m trying to protect Scottie. I don’t want to mention his name. I’m trying to protect TaylorMade, I’m trying to protect the USGA, PGA of America, myself.\" So, McIlroy’s tee shots were going to be under a microscope this week because he would be working with a new driver, and it wasn’t as consistent as it usually is. McIlroy is one of the best drivers on tour, currently ranking first in strokes gained off the tee, while being third in driving distance with an average shot of 319.3 yards.

He ranks 170th in driving accuracy, hitting the fairway 51.13% of the time. At least being cut from this week’s tournament gives McIlroy a couple more days to figure out his driver before teeing it up at the U.S. Open on Thursday.

    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. PresidentDonald Trumpwarned on Saturday that there would be \"serious consequences\" for Elon Musk if he were to fund Democratic candidates. The president made the remark during a phone interview with NBC News. \"If he does, he’ll have to pay the consequences for that,\" Trumptold NBC News. However, according to the outlet, Trump did not detail what the consequences would be. President Donald Trump said he was \"disappointed\" with Elon Musk after the billionaire criticized the Big Beautiful Bill.(Reuters) TIMELINE: INSIDE THE EVOLVING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TRUMP AND MUSK FROM FIRST TERM TO THIS WEEK'S FALLOUT The president also told the outlet that he has no interest in repairing his relationship with the Tesla founder and CEO. When asked if he thought hisrelationship with Muskwas over, Trump reportedly told NBC News, \"I would assume so, yeah.\" Trump also apparently has \"no intention\" of speaking with Musk — which is what he told Fox News Chief Political AnchorBret Baier. Trump and Musk have been engaged in a heated feud that has rapidly escalated in a matter of days. The spat began when Musk criticized the Trump-backed \"Big Beautiful Bill\" after his time with the administration ended. \"I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,\" Musk said in a Tuesday post on X. \"Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong.

In one, Musk accused Trump of being in files related to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

    "article_text": "Fox News host Will Cain breaks down President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's 'big, ugly battle' on 'The Will Cain Show.' Elon Muskappeared to jokingly reconsider his stance on the Big Beautiful Bill after a California Democrat came to his defense. Sen.Adam Schiff, D-Calif., wrote on X that \"I can't believe I'm saying this – but [Elon Musk] is right.\" However, that seems to be the last point on which the two agree. They both object to the Big Beautiful Bill, viewing it as full of pork. Musk opposes the bill because he believes it raises government spending too much, while Schiff objects to what he calls its \"far-right\" content, which he describes as \"dangerous.\" Elon Musk joked that he would reconsider his position on the Big Beautiful Bill after being praised by Sen.

President Donald Trump thanked Musk for his work with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and gave him a symbolic \"key to the White House\" as a parting gift. Following his departure from the White House, Musk said he was looking forward \"to continuing to be a friend and adviser to the president.\" However, things took a sharp turn as a feud between Trump and Musk quickly heated up after the Tesla founder began publicly criticizing the Big Beautiful Bill.

Meanwhile, House Speaker Mike Johnson said he was \"surprised\" by Musk’s reaction and claimed the two of them had a good discussion about the bill. Trump and Musk then began slugging it out on their respective social media platforms — X and Truth Social — as well as TV. The president told reporters in the Oval Office that he was \"very disappointed\" with Musk and claimed that the former DOGE head knew what was in the bill, something that Musk denied.

    "article_text": "Fox News host Jesse Watters discusses the feud between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump on ‘Jesse Watters Primetime.’ From bringing the heat to retreating on the beef. Elon Musk appears to be backtracking on some of the wild accusations he made during his ugly spat withPresident Donald Trumpearlier this week. Musk sensationally posted on Thursday that the president’s name appears in unreleased Jeffrey Epstein files — and said that’s why the files haven’t been made public. \"@RealDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files,\" Musk wrote on X. \"That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!\" Muskfollowed the post with another, saying, \"Mark this post for the future. The truth will come out.\" Elon Musk appears to be backtracking on some of the wild accusations he made during his heated spat with President Donald Trump earlier this week.(Reuters/AP) PRESIDENT TRUMP TEASES ‘LAST DAY, BUT NOT REALLY’ FOR ELON MUSK AT DOGE: OVAL OFFICE PRESSER SET FOR FRIDAY But eagle-eyed online sleuths noticed that Musk had quietly deleted the posts. The former \"First Buddy\" dropped the allegation in response to a back-and-forth series of social media messages between him and Trump. But as of today, the post has been removed from the Tesla CEO’s timeline. The post wasn’t the only one he deleted: Musk also appears to have taken down a post endorsing a message that read, \"Trump should be impeached\" and that Vance \"should replace him.\" Musk shared the post and wrote \"yes,\" but his comment is no longer visible. The beef between Musk and Trump exploded onto the national scene this week with the SpaceX CEO publicly blasting Trump’s major legislation, the Big Beautiful bill, for increasing the deficit by around $2.5 trillion. The feud came despite a months-long \"bromance\" between the pair, with Musk donating around $277 million to Trump’s campaign and enthusiastically supporting his return to office. Trump’s return to office also saw Musk oversee the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) for months. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in the aftermath of Musk’s post that it was an \"unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted.\" U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said the FBI handed over Jeffery Epstein files to the DOJ.(New York State Sex Offender Registry via AP | Getty Images) JEFFREY EPSTEIN LIST: AG PAM BONDI RELEASES HIGHLY ANTICIPATED DOJ DOCUMENTS The White House said a source familiar with the Epstein matter said it is widely known that Trump kicked Epstein out of his Palm Beach Golf Club. The source also pointed out that the administration released the Epstein files, which included Trump’s name, and nothing was new about Musk’s revelation. \"If Elon truly thought the President was more deeply involved with Epstein, why did he hang out with him for 6 months and say he ‘loves him as much as a straight man can love a straight man?'\" the source said. Musk's bombshellallegation against Trump comes months after a trove of files pertaining to the Epstein case were released. In February, Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to FBI Director Kash Patel explaining the delay in the release of documents and placing blame on an FBI field office in New York. Bondi said she requested the full Epstein case file before Patel was confirmed as the head of the FBI and received about 200 pages — far fewer than the number of pages released last year in a civil lawsuit connected toGhisalaine Maxwell, the trafficker’s former lover and convicted accomplice. Although Bondi pushed for the release of the full dossier, which included records, documents, audio and video recordings, and materials related to Epstein and his clients, the request remains unfulfilled. One of the key pieces that remains unreleased is a client list, though Bondi claimed in February it was on her desk to be reviewed. Elon Musk has been a staunch Trump supporter since he endorsed his 2024 run in July.(JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images) The documents that have been released so far include flight logs, an evidence list, a contact book and a redacted \"masseuse list\" believed to refer to Epstein’s victims. Many people named in the documents have never been accused of Epstein-related wrongdoing. However, some have, like Maxwell; Prince Andrew, who has denied allegations of wrongdoing; and Jean-Luc Brunel, a French modeling agent who, like Epstein, died in a jail awaiting trial. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Epstein, Maxwell and unnamed co-conspirators allegedly abused young women and underage girls between 1996 and his death in 2019, according to the lawsuit. Citing police documents, it alleges that Epstein recruited girls between 14 and 16 as well as students at Palm Beach Community College for \"sex-tinged sessions.\" Maxwell is appealing her conviction while serving a sentence at a federal prison in Tallahassee. She is due for release in the summer of 2037. Fox News Digital’s Andrew Mark Miller and Mike Ruiz contributed to this report. Michael Dorgan is a writer for Fox News Digital and Fox Business.

    "article_text": "Democratic strategist James Carville said on Wednesday he doesn’t buy it when wealthy Jewish donors tell him they’re ditching the Democratic Party due to Columbia University protests. He says they’re doing it for a \"f------ tax cut.\" EXCLUSIVE:Veteran Democratic strategistJames Carvilleresponds to Jewish donors who no longer support the Democratic Party due to the pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University. \"I've never seen a Democrat have dinner with Kanye West and Nick Fuentes,\" Carville told Fox News Digital. \"I've never seen a Democrat that endorsed the Alternative für Deutschland Party in Germany. I can point to plenty of Republicans who have.\" Carville is pouring cold water on Democratic donors' excuse that the rise of antisemitism on college campuses, particularly atColumbia University, means they can no longer support the Democratic Party. \"In my view, that makes no sense. You can't be for a Democrat because they're protesting against Biden? It's nonsense,\" Carville said. CARVILLE ACCUSES JEWISH DONORS OF ABANDONING DEMOCRATS FOR GOP BECAUSE THEY JUST WANT THEIR ‘F-----G TAX CUT’ Democrat strategist James Carville (right) criticized the Republican Party's association with individuals accused of antisemitism.(AP/) College campuses became the epicenter of resistance to the war in Gaza as students across the country, a typically Democratic voting bloc, began protesting PresidentJoe Bidenduring his re-election campaign last year. COLUMBIA'S ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTERS SAY TRUMP PULLING $400M IN GRANTS FROM UNIVERSITY IS A 'SCARE TACTIC' Before Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris, students chanted, \"Genocide Joe has got to go!\" outside his campaign rallies in critical swing states and organized protest votes to express their disapproval of the United States' support for Israel in the war against Hamas. Last month, PresidentDonald Trump'sadministration accused Columbia University of violating federal law through its \"deliberate indifference\" towardanti-Israel proteststhat have persisted on campus since Oct. 7, 2023. Democratic strategist James Carville slammed Jewish donors for abandoning the Democratic Party over Columbia University protests.(Screenshot/ \"Politics War Room\" podcast) But Carville, speaking to Fox News Digital about recent comments on his podcast, said it makes no sense for Jewish donors to turn away from the Democratic Party because of protesters at Columbia. Carville said it is theDemocratic Party– not the Republican Party – that has historically supported Israel. \"I would tell my Republican friends, which president was instrumental in the founding of the state of Israel? I happen to know Harry Truman. I happen to know he's a Democrat,\" Carville said. \"Which president came closest to achieving Middle East peace and security for the state of Israel? I happen to know his name was Bill Clinton,\" he added. \"Which president installed the Iron Dome, which saved, I don't know, how many thousands of Israeli lives? I happen to know Barack Obama. So, when you're looking at who is more supportive of the state of Israel, it's not even close,\" Carville told Fox News Digital. US President Donald Trump greets Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as he arrives at the North Portico of the White House in Washington, D.C., Feb. 4, 2025.(Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images) Carville drew a stark contrast with the Republican Party as he criticized Trump for dining with Kanye West, who is infamous for making antisemitic comments, and Nicholas Fuentes, considered a \"white supremacist, Holocaust denier who hates Jews\" by theAmerican Jewish Committee. The longtime Democratic strategist also criticized Elon Musk, who until this week was a loyal Trump confidant and a \"special government employee,\" forendorsing the Alternative for Germany party, considered a \"confirmed extremist\" group by Germany's domestic intelligence agency. Carville said on his podcast, \"Politics War Room,\" this week that those Jewish donors are most likely embracing the Republican Party because they want their \"f---ing tax cut.\" Speaking with Fox News Digital, Carville reiterated that Columbia University protests weren't a very good excuse for abandoning the Democratic Party. But the White House rejected Carville's perception of the Republican Party. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"President Trump received unprecedented support from the Jewish community in his historic re-election, and this support continues to grow as he combats the left’s rampant anti-Semitism that is exposed daily.

    "article_text": "Fox News Digital spoke to Just Facts President James Agresti about DOGE’s efforts to cut waste within the Social Security Administration FIRST ON FOX:A House committee witness who was called out by Democratic Rep. Robert Garcia of California during a hearing this week is pushing back after the congressman unearthed a past social media post onSocial Securityin an attempt to discredit his testimony. During a House oversight DOGE subcommittee hearing on Wednesday, Garcia grilled Power the Future CEO Dan Turner while holding up a posterboard of a past tweet calling Social Security a \"government-sponsored Ponzi scheme.\" \"Madoff went to jail for it. Congress runs on it,\" the post said. \"I should be able to keep 100% of my money and not watch government waste it with a paltry percentage return.\" Garcia then suggested that post was evidence that Turner lacks the credibility to be testifying about the billions of federal tax dollars directed to left-wing NGOs. SOCIAL SECURITY COMMISSIONER BREAKS DOWN PLAN TO SAVE AGENCY FROM INSOLVENCY Power the Future CEO Dan Turner and Dem. Rep. Robert Garcia sparred in a Thursday House hearing(Fox News Digital) \"A Ponzi scheme and so I think it's interesting, of course, as one of our Republican witnesses is calling Social Security a Ponzi scheme, and that's the person that we should be taking advice from here today,\" Garcia said. \"Without Social Security, 22 million people would be pushed into poverty. That includes over 16 million seniors and nearly 1 million children. And in fact,Elon Muskhas also said and agreed with you, sir, that this is a Ponzi scheme. I think it's ironic that you are one of our witnesses talking about efficiency when you want to attack the single best program that we have to support people not just out of poverty, but across this country to uplift them, to ensure they can afford a decent life.\" Fox News Digital spoke to Turner, who stood by his post and outlined his belief, echoed by many, that Social Security is structured like a Ponzi scheme by definition.

GUTTING IT IS A BROKEN PROMISE Former White House Senior Advisor Elon Musk walks to the White House after landing in Marine One on the South Lawn.(Samuel Corum/Getty Images) \"Rep Garcia does not know the definition of Ponzi scheme,\" Turner said. \"Social Security is the ultimate Ponzi, demanding more and more people at the bottom pay in to fund the people at the top, expect our demographics have this now reversed. The system will default. Mr. Garcia nor I will likely never see a dime. That should worry him more than my social media feed.\" Turner told Fox News Digital that if Garcia’s staff were to spend as much time trying to save Social Security as it did \"combing through my social media\" then \"perhaps the Ponzi scheme can survive long enough for me to get a small percentage of what the government confiscated during my lifetime.\" Turner explained that his father had received a \"paltry percentage\" of what he paid into the program and the the government \"kept the rest\" when his father died. \"That’s not just a Ponzi scheme, it’s government greed and politicians running a money-laundering operation to get reelected. No one should be compelled to pay into a failed system, yet in a free America, you don’t have that choice.\" In addition to Turner and Elon Musk suggesting that Social Security is by definition set up like a Ponzi scheme, Fox News Digitalpreviously spoketo James Agresti, president of the nonprofit research institute Just Facts, who said the characterization has \"validity.\" 'FAILURE'S NOT AN OPTION': TRUMP BUDGET BILL WILL BE 'BIG' HELP FOR SENIORS, TOP HOUSE TAX-WRITER SAYS \"A Ponzi scheme operates by taking money from new investors to pay current investors,\" Agresti said. \"That's the definition given by the SEC, and contrary to popular belief, that's exactly how Social Security operates.\" Agresti explained to Fox News Digital that Social Security, a program mired for decades with concerns about waste, fraud, and improper payments, \"doesn't take our money and save it for us, as many people believe, and then give it to us when we're older\" like many Americans might believe. \"What it does is, it transfers money when we are young and working and paying into Social Security taxes,\" Agresti said. \"That money, the vast bulk of it, goes immediately out the door to people who are currently receiving benefits. Now, there is a trust fund, but in 90 years of operation, that trust fund currently has enough money to fund two years of program operations.\" The trust fund only being able to last for two years is not a result of the fund being \"looted,\" Agresti explained, but rather it was put in place to \"put surpluses in it\" from money that Social Security collects in taxes that it doesn't pay out immediately and pays interest on. \"The interest that's been paid on that has been higher than the rate of inflation,\" Agresti said. \"So, the problem isn't that the trust fund has been looted. The problem is that Social Security operates like a Ponzi scheme.\" Democrats have vocally pushed back againstefforts by Republicansand DOGE to reform Social Security or make cuts to what they say are examples of wasteful or improper spending from the department. \"There's been a lot of misinformation about that as of late,\" Agresti told Fox News Digital. \"You know, when DOGE came in and suggested that the Social Security Administration cut, I think it was about 10,000 workers, Democrats erupted that this is going to weaken Social Security. But the fact of the matter is that Social Security pays those workers who are for administrative overhead from the Social Security trust fund. So, by cutting out the money that they're paying them, you actually strengthen the program financially.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Rep. Robert Garcia, Democrat from California, speaks on the first day of the Democratic National Convention (DNC).(AP) Agresti told Fox News Digital that the current administrative overhead for Social Security is $6.7 billion per year, which is enough to pay more than 300,000 retirees the average old-age benefit. \"Every single study shows social security going completely bankrupt in the next few years. Garcia and other democrats know the iceberg is ahead but rather than turn the ship, they are yelling at the iceberg about the senior citizens onboard,\" Turner said. \"This Ponzi scheme is collapsing fast, and turning my tweets into posters is not going to stop it.\" Andrew Mark Miller is a reporter at Fox News.

Aformer D.C. police officerhas been sentenced to 18 months in prison after being convicted on one count of obstructing justice and three counts of making false statements. Shane Lamond, who was the supervisor of the Intelligence Branch of theMetropolitan Police Department’sHomeland Security Bureau, leaked sensitive information to then-national chairman of the Proud Boys, Henry \"Enrique\" Tarrio.

Lamond was convicted in December 2024 for tipping off Tarrio about his own department’s investigation into the destruction of a \"Black Lives Matter\" (BLM) banner. \"As proven at trial, Lamond turned his job on its head—providing confidential information to a source, rather than getting information from him—lied about the conduct, and obstructed an investigation into the source,\"U.S. AttorneyMatthew M.

This did not change after Lamond’s department began an investigation into the Dec. 12, 2020, destruction of a BLM banner. Despite the fact that Tarrio was considered the \"prime subject\" of the investigation, Lamond gave the then-Proud Boys leader \"confidential law enforcement information.\" The Justice Department says that Tarrio passed the information to other members of the Proud Boys.

Tarrio, who was traveling from Florida to D.C. when he received the message, was arrested and pleaded guilty. In D.C., the maximum penalty for obstruction of justice is 30 years in prison, while false statement charges carry a maximum of five years.

The Progressive group \"Indivisible,\" which was behind many of theTesla protestsin recent months as well as mobilizing for other far-left causes, appears to now be getting involved in a key congressional swing district with the goal of growing resistance against President Donald Trump in Congress. With primary races already underway for the 2026 Midterm elections, the group appears to have in their sights Rep. Mike Lawler, a Republican in a critical swing state representing New York's 17th District, in the form of a candidate with extensive ties to the group, progressive Democrat and Rockland County legislator Beth Davidson. Davidson's social media presence includes several posts promoting Indivisible, includingattending an eventin June in Rockland, New York and Davidson was featured in apromotional videofor Indivisible Northern Westchester that same month. Indivisible has been front and center in other aspects of the race and local chapters of the group helped to organize protests atLawler town hall eventsin April and May.

Footage obtained by Fox News Digital of the meeting showed organizing committee leader Pascale Jean-Gilles discussing filling the entire street in front of the event. \"It is a long street, and we’re trying to fill the entire street, so everyone coming into the rally will see people there and recognize it’s not going to be all, like, sunshine and daisies,\" Jean-Gilles said. Ahead of the event, Davidson indicated that over a thousand protesters would attend the demonstration, saying on X: \"Please pass him a note that 1100 or so of his ‘friends’ are excited to see him in my county legislative district tomorrow!\" At another Indivisible protest against Lawler earlier in the month, Davidson posted on X that she was \"proud to stand with more than a thousand people at the #HandsOff rally organized by @IndivisWstchr @1199seiu @nwindivisible@cwaunion and more to stand up for our freedoms and our future!\" \"Mike Lawler may be silent on the daily assaults on healthcare, education, social security and national security, but We the People are NOT!\" said Davidson.

Bill Batson, a member of the Indivisible Rockland steering committee, gave $250 to Davidson's campaign via his own campaign committee,FEC records show. In response to Indivisible and Davidson’s apparent collaboration, National Republican Congressional Committee spokesperson Maureen O’Toole accused the group of \"infiltrating\" congressional races to undermine Trump’s agenda. \"Indivisible has a new plan: Stop shouting outside congressional offices and start infiltrating them,\" said O’Toole. \"Their first attempt? NY-17, where they’re backing far-left extremist Beth Davidson to carry out their agenda.\" Indivisible was founded in response to Trump’s election in 2016, according to its website. The group’s website says that they were \"brought together by a practical guide to resist the Trump agenda, Indivisible is a movement of thousands of group leaders and more than a million members taking regular, iterative, and increasingly complex actions to resist the GOPs agenda, elect local champions, and fight for progressive policies.\" A member of the Seattle Fire Department inspects a burned Tesla Cybertruck at a Tesla lot in Seattle, Monday, March 10, 2025.(AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson, File) Indivisible's presence at Tesla protests nationwide, according to aWashington Free Beacon report, included a \"reimbursement program\" for local activists that showed up at the protests. Indivisible, a group that has received more than $7 million from the George Soros network since 2017,according to the New York Post, has also been involved in protests calling to \"abolish\" ICE. The group has alsopromoted defunding the police. Earlier this year, Indivisible published a \"tool kit\" with recommendations for protesting at town halls and lawmakers' district offices. A section on how to \"take the fight to Elon\" includes steps for planning and executing a demonstration at Tesla dealerships, showrooms and factories forElon Musk’s role as then-head of theDepartment of Government Efficiency. While many of the protests outside Tesla dealerships were peaceful, the anti-Musk effort resulted in several instances of violence that the Department of Justicelabeled \"domestic terrorism\", including acts of arson. In a statement to Fox News Digital, Lawler campaign spokesperson Chris Russell, called Davidson's association with Indivisible \"disgraceful.\" \"They’ve had Nazi imagery and antisemitic tropes at their rallies and promoted a baseless election denialism conspiracy theory rooted in antisemitism on their website. I’m demanding she denounce them immediately, this dangerous rhetoric will lead to more violence and threatens our democracy.\" With primary races already underway for the 2026 Midterm elections, Indivisible appears to have in its sights Rep.

Cross/Bloomberg via Getty Images and AP Photo/Mike Stewart) Davidson condemned the imagery at the rally she attended in apost on Xin March saying, \"To be clear, I absolutely condemn the imagery of that poster. I will always be a voice against anti-Semitism and for my Jewish community. It's time for Mike Lawler to stop weaponizing antisemitism for his own political gain and stop using the Jewish community — my community, not his — as political pawns.\" Lawlerresponded on Xmaking the case that Davidson's statement did not go far enough. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News Digital reached out to the Davidson campaign for comment on this story. Davidson has been endorsed by Mondaire Jones, a progressive who is the last Democrat to hold Lawler's seat. The race for NY-17 will be one of the most closely watched in the country as Republicans attempt to preserve their razor-thin majority in Congress, which historically has proven difficult for the party in power following a new president taking office.

    "title": "Democrat-controlled budget office wrongly analyzed Trump's big bill, missed record savings, White House says",
    "article_text": "Sen. Rand Paul, R- Ky., says the debt limit increase included in President Donald Trump's bill is a deal-breaker for him: \"It's just not a conservative thing to do.\" The White House is challenging the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office’s assessment that President Donald Trump’s sweeping tax and spending package will raise thefederal deficitby trillions of dollars throughout the next decade. The national debt, currently $36.2 trillion, tracks what the U.S. owes its creditors, while the national deficit measures how much the federal government’s spending exceeds its revenues. So far, the federal government has spent more than $1 trillion more than it has collected this fiscal year, according to the Department of the Treasury. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) issued ananalysis Wednesdaypredicting that the so-called \"big, beautiful, bill\" the House passed in May would increase the federal deficit by $2.4 trillion over the next 10 years. But according to the White House,the CBO’s analysisis based on a faulty premise because it assumes that Republicans in Congress will fail to extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts. Rather, the White House’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB)forecasts in new analysis released Saturdaythat the tax and spending measures would independently reduce deficits by $1.4 trillion.

The \"big, beautiful, bill\" has faced criticism from figures including SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who labeled the measure an \"abomination\" and argued that the bill would increase the federal deficit. The measure now heads to the Senate, where lawmakers, including Sen. Rand Paul, R-K.Y., have voiced opposition to the legislation.

Scott Applewhite/The Associated Press) Meanwhile, OMB Director Russell Vought told lawmakers on the House Appropriations Committee Wednesday that he believed the CBO’s analysis was \"fundamentally wrong.\" \"It will lead to reduced deficits and debt of $1.4 trillion,\" Vought said. \"It will reduce mandatory savings of $1.7 trillion. I don't think the way they construct their baseline, not only does it not give a fair shake to economic growth, but it fundamentally misreads the economic consequences of not extending the current tax relief.\" Failure to pass Trump’s tax package would trigger a recession, according to Vought. \"We'll have a recession,\" Vought told lawmakers. \"The economic storm clouds will be very dark. I think we'll have a 60% tax increase on the American people.\" Meanwhile, the White House has accused the CBO of employing those who’ve contributed to Democratic campaigns, even though CBO Director Phillip Swagel served in former President George W. Bush’s administration.

    "article_text": "'Kudlow’ host Larry Kudlow discusses the fiery exchanges between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump over the ‘big, beautiful bill’ on ‘America Reports.’ PresidentDonald Trumpand SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk engaged in a public feud Thursday, less than a week after the White House held a farewell press conference for Musk highlighting his contributions spearheading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk departed his tenure as a special government employee with DOGE May 30, but swiftly launched into criticisms of Trump’s massive tax and spending package dubbed the \"big, beautiful, bill.\" Tuesday, Musk labeled the measure a \"disgusting abomination\" because of reports it ramps up the federal deficit. On Thursday, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that Musk opposed the bill because it eliminates an electric vehicle tax credit that benefits companies like Tesla. But Trump said that provision has always been part of the measure. \"I'm very disappointed, because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here, better than you people,\" Trump said in the Oval Office in a meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. \"He knew everything about it. He had no problem with it. All of a sudden he had a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out that we're going to have to cut the EV mandate, because that's billions and billions of dollars, and it really is unfair.\" TRUMP NOT INTERESTED IN TALKING TO MUSK: ‘ELON’S TOTALLY LOST IT' Elon Musk receives a golden key from President Donald Trump in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, May 30, 2025.(Nathan Howard/Reuters) Musk immediately responded on X to Trump's statements, urging a removal of the \"disgusting pork\" included in the measure. He also said it was \"false\" that he had been shown the measure \"even once.\" The two continued to publicly spar against one another, with Musk asserting that Trump wouldn’t have won the 2024 election if it weren’t for his own backing. Meanwhile, Trump accused Musk of going \"CRAZY\" over cuts to the EV credits, and said that Musk had been \"wearing thin.\" Additionally, Trump told Fox News on Friday that \"Elon's totally lost it\" and was not interested in speaking over the phone with Musk, despite media reports suggesting that the two would talk. Here’s what also happened this week: Chancellor of Germany Friedrich Merz met with Trump at the White House Thursday, where the two discussed the war in Ukraine. While Merz asserted that the U.S. was in a powerful spot to bring a meaningful end to the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, Trump offered that the world might need to \"let them fight for a little while.\" \"America is again in a very strong position to do something on this war and ending this war,\" Merz said. MERZ SAYS US IN A ‘STRONG POSITION’ TO STOP PUTIN President Donald Trump greets German Chancellor Friedrich Merz upon arrival at the West Wing of the White House in Washington, June 5, 2025.(Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images) Merz said that Germany was willing to help however it could, and wanted to discuss options to partner with the U.S. to bring peace. Likewise, Merz suggested that European allies exert additional pressure on Russia to end the conflict. But Trump said that he told Putin in a recent call that perhaps both countries would need to feel the consequences of fighting more acutely, claiming he had told Putin \"maybe you're going to have to keep fighting and suffering a lot.\" \"Sometimes you see two young children fighting like crazy – they hate each other, and they're fighting in a park, and you try and pull them apart, they don't want to be pulled,\" Trump said.  \"Sometimes you're better off letting them fight for a while and then pulling them apart.\" Trump spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping Thursday to discuss trade negotiations between Washington and Beijing. \"I just concluded a very good phone call with President Xi, of China, discussing some of the intricacies of our recently made, and agreed to, Trade Deal,\" Trump said Thursday in a Truth Social post. \"The call lasted approximately one and a half hours, and resulted in a very positive conclusion for both Countries.\" Trump said the conversation had focused \"almost entirely\" on trade, and that Xi had invited the U.S. president and first lady Melania Trump to visit China. Likewise, Trump reciprocated and invited Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, to visit the U.S. TRUMP TOUTS ‘VERY POSITIVE’ BREAKTHROUGH WITH XI AFTER SLAMMING CHINA FOR TRADE VIOLATION President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The call comes nearly a week after Trump condemned China on May 30 for violating an initial trade agreement that the U.S. and China had hashed out in May. And on Wednesday, Trump said Xi was \"extremely hard to make a deal with\" in a Truth Social post. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The negotiations from May prompted both countries to agree that the U.S. would lower its tariffs against Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, and China would reduce its tariffs against U.S. imports from 125% to 10%.

    "title": "Trump's conservative allies warn Congress faces critical 'test' with $9.4B spending cut proposal",
    "article_text": "Senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports the latest as Congress moves to codify billions in DOGE cuts recommended by Elon Musk. Some of the White House’s conservative House allies say they’re interpreting the upcoming vote on PresidentDonald Trump’s$9.4 billion spending cut proposal as a \"test\" of what Congress can achieve in terms of rolling back federal funding. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said he would not speak for members of the Trump administration but added, \"I do think it is a test.\" \"And I think this is going to demonstrate whether Congress has the fortitude to do what they always say they’ll do,\" Roy said. \"Cut the minimal amount of spending – $9 billion, NPR, PBS, things you complain about for a long time, or are they going to go back into their parochial politics?\" House GOP leaders unveiled legislation seeking to codify Trump’s spending cut request, known as a rescissions package, on Friday. It’s expected to get a House-wide vote sometime next week. MEET THE TRUMP-PICKED LAWMAKERS GIVING SPEAKER JOHNSON A FULL HOUSE GOP CONFERENCE President Donald Trump has formally asked Congress to cut $9.4 billion in funds to PBS, NPR and USAID.(Getty Images/AP Images) \"The rescissions requestsent to Congressby the Trump Administration takes the federal government in a new direction where we actually cut waste, fraud, and abuse and hold agencies accountable to the American people,\" House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said in a statement introducing the bill. The legislation would claw back funding that Congress already appropriated to PBS, NPR, and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) – cuts outlined by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) earlier this year. And while several Republican leaders and officials have already said they expect to see more rescissions requests down the line, some people who spoke with Fox News Digital believe the White House is watching how Congress handles this first package before deciding on next steps. \"You’re dead right,\" Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., told Fox News Digital when asked if the rescissions package was a test. \"I think that it’s a test case – if we can’t get that…then we’re not serious about cutting the budget.\" A rescissions package only needs simple majorities in the House and Senate to pass. But Republicans in both chambers have perilously slim majorities that afford them few defections. Republicans are also racing the clock – a rescissions package has 45 days to be considered otherwise it is considered rejected and the funding reinstated. MIKE JOHNSON, DONALD TRUMP GET ‘BIG, 'BEAUTIFUL’ WIN AS BUDGET PASSES HOUSE Rep. Chip Roy said the spending cuts package will \"demonstrate whether Congress has the fortitude to do what they always say they’ll do.\"(Anna Moneymaker) Rep. Lance Gooden, R-Texas, did not directly say whether he viewed the spending cuts as a test but dismissed any potential concerns. \"This is very low-hanging fruit, and I don’t anticipate any problems,\" Gooden told Fox News Digital. \"I’ve heard a few comments in the media, but I don’t think they’re serious comments. If someone on the Republican side can make a case for PBS, but they won’t take a tough vote against illegal immigration, then we’ve got a lot of problems.\" Paul Winfree, president and CEO of the Economic Policy Innovation Center (EPIC), told Fox News Digital last week, \"This first rescissions package from President Trump is a test as to whether Congress has the ability to deliver on his mandate by canceling wasteful spending through a filibuster-proof process.\" \"If they can’t then it’s a signal for the president to turn up the dial with other tools at his disposal,\" Winfree, who served as Director of Budget Policy in the first Trump administration, said. Both Roy and Norman suggested a process known as \"pocket rescissions\" could be at least one backup plan – and one that Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought has floated himself. \"Pocket rescissions\" essentially would mean the White House introduces its spending cut proposal less than 45 days before the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. In theory, it would run out the clock on those funds and allow them to expire whether Congress acted or not. Vought told reporters after meeting withSpeaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Monday that he wanted to \"see if it passes\" but was \"open\" to further rescissions packages. \"We want to send up general rescissions bills, to use the process if it's appropriate, to get them through the House and the Senate,\" Vought said. \"We also have pocket rescissions, which you’ve begun to hear me talk a lot about, to be able to use the end of the fiscal year to send up a similar rescissions, and have the funds expire. So there's a lot of things that we're looking at.\" Still, some moderate Republicans may chafe at the conservative spending cuts. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., refused to comment on whether he’d support the legislation before seeing the details but alluded to some concerns. \"Certainly I'm giving you a non-answer right now until I read the details,\" Bacon said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"It does bother me because I have a great rapport with Nebraska Public Radio and TV. I think they've been great to work with, and so that would be one I hope they don't put in.\" He also raised concerns about some specific USAID programs, including critical investments to fight Ebola and HIV in Africa. The legislation is expected to come before the House Rules Committee, the final gatekeeper before most legislation sees a House-wide vote, on Tuesday afternoon. It's separate from Trump's \"one big, beautiful bill,\" a broad piece of legislation advancing the president's tax, energy, and immigration agenda through the budget reconciliation process.

    "article_text": "‘Fox & Friends Weekend’ co-hosts Rachel Campos-Duffy and Charles Hurt break down the growing rift between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, after they exchanged public jabs online. The fallout betweenElon Muskand President Donald Trump is an evolving situation marked by a public blowup on Thursday, but their relationship ties back to Trump’s first term and even earlier. A November 2016CNBC interviewwith the Tesla CEO, who’s now the richest man in the world, took a critical tone of the now president just days before he was elected president in an upset that signified the strength of the populist movement. \"Honestly, I think Hillary’s economic policies and her environmental policies particularly are the right ones, you know, but yeah. Also, I don’t think this is the finest moment in our democracy at all,\" Musk said. \"Well, I feel a bit stronger that probably he’s not the right guy. He just doesn’t seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the United States,\" he later added in the interview. 'KILL BILL': ELON MUSK'S CONSERVATIVE EVOLUTION PUTS HIM AT ODDS WITH TRUMP ON KEY LEGISLATION U.S. President Donald Trump and Elon Musk attend a press conference in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., May 30, 2025.(REUTERS/Nathan Howard) During Trump's first term, Musk was part of some of his economic advisory councils, which often includes CEOs, but ultimately left his post because he disagreed with the president’s move to exit the Paris Climate Accords. \"Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,\" Musk posted at the time. The two continued to have an on-and-off relationship, but there were some positive signs in May 2020. \"Elon Musk, congratulations.  Congratulations, Elon. Thanks, Elon. For Elon and 8,000 SpaceX employees, today is the fulfillment of a dream almost two decades in the making,\" Trump said at the Kennedy Space Center in May 2020. And at the SpaceX Demo-2 launch, Trump said he and Musk communicate regularly. \"Well, I won’t get into it.  But, yeah — but I speak to him all the time.  Great guy.  He’s one of our great brains.  We like great brains.  And Elon has done a fantastic job,\" he said. ELON MUSK'S NET WORTH PLUMMETS BY $34B AMID ESCALATING FEUD WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP President Donald Trump and Elon Musk(Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC) Fast forward to 2022, when Musk purchased Twitter and renamed it X, and brought back Trump’s account that November, after it was suspended after the events of Jan. 6, 2021. In 2022, Musk also announced that he would vote Republican, but indicated he would back Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis if he opted to seek the nomination. DeSantis launched his campaign on X in a \"space,\" a virtual public event forum, with Musk, who also reportedly significantly financially backed the Florida governor, according to TheWall Street Journal. However, a major turning point was in July 2024, after the assassination attempt of Trump at a rally in Butler, Penn. \"I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery,\" Musk posted. Musk then campaigned for the president, including a famous moment when he was jumping on stage at his comeback rally in Butler. WOULD DONALD TRUMP HAVE WON THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WITHOUT ELON MUSK'S HELP? BUTLER, PA - OCT. 5: Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk speaks with former president Donald Trump during a campaign event at the Butler Farm Show, Saturday, Oct. 5, 2024, in Butler, Pa.((Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images)) \"I want to say what an honor it is to be here and, you know, the true test of someone's character is how they behave under fire, right?\" Musk said at the rally. \"And we had one president who couldn't climb a flight of stairs and another who was fist pumping after getting shot.\" \"This is no ordinary election,\" the tech CEO continued. \"The other side wants to take away your freedom of speech.\" \"Just be a pest to everyone,\" he added. \"You know, people on the street everywhere: Vote, vote, vote!\" The tech billionaire spent roughly $300 million through America PAC to boost swing state voter efforts, including Pennsylvania. By the time the presidential election rolled around, Trump and Musk appeared to be close friends as the Tesla CEO was with Trump in Mar-a-Lago on election night. Over the next few days, Musk remained in Florida and was reportedly advising Trump on appointments and policy as the transition to a new administration kicked off. A week later, shortly before Musk and the new president appeared at a SpaceX launch together in Texas, Trump announced that Musk and tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy would be heading up the Department of Government Efficiency in an effort to rid the government of waste, fraud, and abuse. Trump described the pair as \"two wonderful Americans' and although Ramaswamy left that post in January and is now running for governor in Ohio, Musk stayed on and quickly became the face of an agency that made him the main target of attacks from Democrats pushing back on spending cuts that they argued were too drastic. Protests erupted nationwide against Musk and DOGE includingviolent outburstsat his Tesla dealerships that tanked the company's stock and were labeled as acts of \"domestic terrorism\" by the Justice Department. FLASHBACK: TOP FIVE WILDEST MOMENTS FROM ELON MUSK'S DOGE TENURE AS IT COMES TO AN END President Donald Trump bought a Tesla from Musk at the White House as a show of support earlier this year when the EV-maker faced consumer backlash over Musk's political activism.(Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images) During the first few months of the year, Musk and Trump were spotted together at several viral events including a UFC fight, an Oval Office meeting where Musk's son \"Little X\" stole the show, and a cabinet meeting in late February where Musk was the main focus. In March, Trump hosted Elon at a Tesla showcase in front of the White House amid a dip in Tesla stock where the president told reporters he was purchasing a Tesla while touting the company. As Musk's time at DOGE began to wind down, his employee classification allowed him to serve for 130 days, the newly formed agency had become the poster child of anti-Trump sentiment from Democrats who consistently attacked the $175 billion in spending cuts that DOGE estimated it delivered. Signs of fracture in the relationship began showing in late May when Musk took a public shot at Trump's \"big beautiful bill\" as it made its way through Congress. \"I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,\" Musk said. Two days later, Musk announced his official departure from DOGE. \"As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,\" Musk said, adding that the effects of DOGE \"will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.\" U.S. President-elect Donald Trump greets Elon Musk as he arrives to attend a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket(Brandon Bell) DOGE, which fell short of Musk's initial goal of slashing $1 trillion in spending which Musk said he stillremains optimisticwill happen in the future, will continue its work without Musk, who said, \"I look forward to continuing to be a friend and adviser to the president.\" That optimistic tone shifted drastically on June 3 when Musk took to X, the platform he owns, and blasted the budget reconciliation bill calling it \"a disgusting abomination\" and criticizing the Republicans who voted for it. \"KILL THE BILL,\" Musk said the next day. A day after that, on Thursday, the feud hit a fever pitch. While speaking with reporters in the Oval Office, Trump said that he was \"very disappointed\" by Musk’s vocal criticisms of the bill. The president claimed that Musk knew what was in the bill and \"had no problem\" with it until the EV incentives had to be cut. On X, Musk called that assessment \"false.\" Trump turned to social media to criticize Musk, who he appointed to find ways to cut $2 trillion after forming the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). \"Elon was ‘wearing thin,’ I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!\" Trump said in one post. In another post, Trump said, \"I don’t mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago. This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress. It’s a Record Cut in Expenses, $1.6 Trillion Dollars, and the Biggest Tax Cut ever given.\" \"If this Bill doesn’t pass, there will be a 68% tax increase, and things far worse than that. I didn’t create this mess, I’m just here to FIX IT. This puts our Country on a Path of Greatness.

It is unclear if a resolution to the feud is coming in the next few days.Fox News Digital reportedon Friday morning that Musk wants to speak to Trump and that White House aides could possibly broker a meeting. Trumptold Fox Newson Friday that he isn't interested in talking to Musk,adding that \"Elon's totally lost it.\" Trump also said to Fox News' Bret Baier that he isn't worried about Musk's suggestion to form a new political party, citing favorable polls and strong support from Republicans on Capitol Hill.

    "title": "Trump admin cracks down on antisemitism as DOJ official exposes 'violent rhetoric' of radical protesters",
    "article_text": "FDD research analyst Mariam Wahba, a friend of one of the slain Israeli embassy staffers, joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the antisemitic attack in Colorado less than two weeks after the incident in Washington, D.C. The Trump administration has taken a more aggressive approach than its predecessor toward addressing the nationwide surge inantisemitic incidents, launching investigations, punishing elite universities, and intensifying its immigration enforcement practices. PresidentDonald Trump, through the Department of Justice (DOJ) and other agencies, is using law-and-order tactics that his deputies say are necessary but that critics say could constitute overreach. Harmeet Dhillon, the DOJ's assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division, told Fox News Digital she has not seen any \"close cases\" when it comes to weighing antisemitic behavior against First Amendment rights of those who oppose Israel or Judaism. BIDEN EDUCATION DEPT PUT PRIORITY ON PRONOUNS, LEFT BACKLOG OF NEARLY 200 ANTISEMITISM COMPLAINTS: OFFICIAL \"Criticizing the government of Israel is not what I'm typically seeing here,\" Dhillon said. \"I'm seeing an intifada revolution. I'm seeing blocking Jewish students from crossing campuses and destroying property on campus, which is a crime. . . . Quiet, polite conversation and disagreement with Israeli policy is not really what's happening here. It's literally people saying Israel shouldn't exist — and bringing the revolution to the United States.\" Dhillon added that \"that type of violent rhetoric has led to violent acts in our country.\" After Hamas’s deadly terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, the FBI’s hate crimestatisticsshowed a sharp spike in anti-Jewish incidents in the U.S. The data runs through December 2023. Anti-Defamation League (ADL)datafrom 2024 and high-profile incidents this year suggest the trend is continuing. Police respond to a firebombing in Boulder, Colo., last week, where a suspect identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, right, was arrested and charged by state and federal authorities.(Storyful/KDVR) An Egyptian national in the U.S. illegally in Boulder, Colorado, is facing state and federal charges for allegedly injuring 15 people, including elderly victims, and a dog last weekend with Molotov cocktails during a peaceful pro-Israel demonstration in support of hostages being held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza. SuspectMohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, stated to authorities that \"he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead,\" according to an FBI affidavit. During the attack he allegedly yelled \"free Palestine,\" the agent said. In May, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, who worked at the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C., were gunned down outside the Capitol Jewish Museum in D.C. Suspect Elias Rodriguez of Illinois shouted \"free Palestine\" as he was detained, and Interim U.S. Attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro said her office is investigating the case as a hate crime and act of terrorism. Mohamed Sabry Soliman, left, and Elias Rodriguez allegedly committed crimes, including murder, and shouted, \"Free Palestine\" afterward.(Alex Osante / Instagram/@shinewithIsrael) SUSPECT CHARGED WITH MURDERING ISRAELI EMBASSY STAFF COULD FACE DEATH PENALTY In another incident, a man allegedly set fire to Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’s residence on the first night of Passover. Emergency call logs released by local authorities revealed that the suspect, Cody Balmer, invoked Palestine after the arson and blamed Shapiro, who is Jewish, for \"having my friends killed.\" Tarek Bazrouk, who identified himself as a \"Jew hater\" and said Jewish people were \"worthless,\" allegedly carried out a series of assaults on Jewish New Yorkers in 2024 and 2025, according to an indictment brought against him in May. Bazrouk wore a green headband that mimicked Hamas garb and a keffiyeh during the attacks, and he celebrated Hamas and Hizballah on his social media, according to federal authorities. Trump warned in an executive order at the start of his presidency that foreign nationals participating in \"pro-jihadist protests\" would be deported, and he specifically highlighted college campuses as being \"infested with radicalism.\" Unlike the Biden administration, the Trump administration has since gone to war with elite universities, some of which have been roiled by disruptive pro-Palestinian protests that involve occupying academic buildings and installing encampments. The Trump administration has taken on elite universities such as Harvard. LEO TERRELL SAYS TRUMP ADMIN WILLING TO TAKE HARVARD ANTISEMITISM FIGHT ALL THE WAY TO SUPREME COURT Harvard and Columbia, in particular, are now engaged in litigation after Trump moved to freeze billions of dollars in federal funding for the universities and ban Harvard's foreign students. The embattled schools have been successful in winning temporary pauses to Trump’s sanctions through the courts, but litigation is pending, and legal experts have said they face an uphill battle. The Trump administration has zeroed in on non-citizen students and activists who it has accused of supporting Palestinian causes in ways it deems hostile to U.S. interests. Amid Trump’s pursuit of visa and green card holders, Mahmoud Khalil’s case has become a flashpoint. Khalil was arrested in March and detained after the administration accused him of violating immigration laws by engaging in anti-Israel activism. This week, Khalil said in court papers the administration’s claims against him were \"grotesque\" and that his activism involved \"protesting this Israeli government’s indiscriminate killing of thousands of innocent Palestinians.\" Acting Columbia University President Claire Shipman was interrupted by students during graduation, who chanted, \"Free Mahmoud!\" calling for Mahmoud Khalil, right, to be freed.(Columbia University / Selcuk Acar/Anadolu via Getty Images) Civil rights groups have warned that the government’s hardliner posture risks violating free speech and protest rights. A coalition of 60 groups issued ajoint statementthis week on antisemitic hate crimes in which it warned the Trump administration not to over-correct because it would \"make us all less safe.\" \"As we condemn these heinous [antisemitic] acts and those who perpetrate hate and violence, we also recommit to ensuring that these events — and the legitimate fear in the Jewish community — are not exploited to justify inhumane immigration policies or to target Arab Americans and those who peacefully and nonviolently exercise their First Amendment rights in support of Palestinian human rights,\" the groups said. Dhillon told Fox News Digital: \"It's not my responsibility to balance free speech issues on campus. It's my responsibility to enforce the federal civil rights laws. And my opinion, there's really no conflict.\" When he took office, Trump vowed in a string of executive orders to direct Attorney General Pam Bondi to \"aggressively prosecute terroristic threats, arson, vandalism and violence against American Jews.\" Trump appointees at the DOJ then moved quickly to convene an antisemitism task force. Dhillon said there is also frequent communication between the White House, the DOJ, and Jewish leaders about addressing antisemitism. JEWISH STUDENTS WELCOME TRUMP ADMIN'S CRACKDOWN ON ANTISEMITISM, HAMAS SYMPATHIZERS ON CAMPUSES Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division Harmeet Dhillon says she's focused on launching the division's work toward combating antisemitism.(Kyle Grillot/Bloomberg via Getty Images) \"We have heard from the Jewish community, and I've probably met with — I think there's at least two dozen rabbis who have my number on speed dial now. I literally sent three emails to rabbis in the last hour,\" she said. She said her division has opened several investigations involving land use for religious purposes under a law known as the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), including five related to Judaism. The administration is also notifying Jewish communities of grants available for added security at synagogues, and she said that campuses are a \"significant focus\" for her. After reports surfaced that Dhillon's shakeup in the Civil Rights Division led to a mass exodus of more than 100 attorneys leaving the division, she told the media she was unfazed by the departures and that her focus remains on launching the division's work toward combating antisemitism. Testing the limits of his subordinates and the courts, another top DOJ official, Emil Bove, launched an internal investigation into Columbia student protesters early this year. The probe caused concern among some line attorneys, who felt it was flimsy, and was also met with multiple reprimands from a magistrate judge, according to the New York Times. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in a statement in May that the New York Times' story was false and had been fed to the newspaper \"by a group of people who allowed antisemitism and support of Hamas terrorists to fester for years.\" Blanche confirmed the veracity of the investigation and said it involved, in part, a probe into a Hamas-linked image on Columbia University Apartheid Divest’s social media.

    "title": "Continued court fights could put Harvard in unwinnable position vs Trump",
    "article_text": "Fox News contributor Richard Fowler and National Review editor-in-chief Rich Lowry join 'MediaBuzz' to discuss Trump's funding battle with Harvard. A federal judge in Massachusetts on Thursday granted Harvard University's emergency request to block, for now, theTrump administration'seffort to ban international students from its campus, siding with Harvard in ruling that the university would likely suffer \"immediate and irreparable harm\" if enforced. The temporary restraining order from U.S. District Judge Allison D. Burroughs blocks the administration from immediately stripping Harvard of its certification status under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, or SEVP — a program run by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that allows universities to sponsor international students for U.S. visas. Burroughs said in her order that Harvard has demonstrated evidence it \"will suffer immediate and irreparable injury before there is an opportunity to hear from all parties,\" prompting her to temporarily block the SEVP revocation. Still, some see the order as a mere Band-Aid, forestalling a larger court fight between Harvard and the Trump administration — and one that Trump critics say could be unfairly weighted against the nation's oldest university. STATE DEPARTMENT NOW SCRUTINIZING ALL VISA HOLDERS ASSOCIATED WITH HARVARD Banners hang outside the Harry Elkins Widener Memorial Library at the Harvard University campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on May 27.(Sophie Park/Bloomberg) \"Ultimately, this is about Trump trying to impose his view of the world on everybody else,\" Harvard Law professor Noah Feldman said in a radio interview discussing theTrump administration'sactions. Since President Donald Trump took office in January, the administration has frozen more than $2 billion in grants and contracts awarded to the university. It is also targeting the university with investigations led by six separate federal agencies. Combined, these actions have created a wide degree of uncertainty at Harvard. The temporary restraining order handed down on Thursday night is also just that — temporary. Though the decision does block Trump from revoking Harvard's SEVP status, it's a near-term fix, designed to allow the merits of the case to be more fully heard. Meanwhile, the administration is almost certain to appeal the case to higher courts, which could be more inclined to side in favor of the administration. And that's just the procedural angle. JUDGES V TRUMP: HERE ARE THE KEY COURT BATTLES HALTING THE WHITE HOUSE AGENDA Harvard President Alan Garber acknowledges an extended round of applause during Harvard University's commencement ceremonies in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on May 29.(AP Photo/Charles Krupa) Should Harvard lose its status for SEVP certification — a certification it has held for some 70 years — the thousands of international students currently enrolled at Harvard would have a very narrow window to either transfer to another U.S. university, or risk losing their student visas within 180 days, experts told Fox News. Some may opt not to take that chance, and transfer to a different school that's less likely to be targeted by the administration — even if it means sacrificing, for certainty, a certain level of prestige. Regardless of how the court rules, these actions create \"a chilling effect\" for international students at Harvard, Aram Gavoor, an associate dean atGeorge Washington University Law Schooland a former Justice Department attorney, said in an interview. Students \"who would otherwise be attending or applying to Harvard University [could be] less inclined to do so, or to make alternative plans for their education In the U.S.,\" Gavoor said. Even if the Trump administration loses on the merits of the case, \"there's a point to be argued that it may have won as a function of policy,\" Gavoor said. People walk through the gate on Harvard Yard at the Harvard University campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on June 29, 2023.(Getty Images) Meanwhile, any financial fallout the school might see as a result is another matter entirely. Though the uncertainty yielded by Trump's fight against Harvard could prove damaging to the school's priority of maintaining a diverse international student body, or by offering financial aid to students via the federally operated Pell Grant, these actions alone would unlikely to prove financially devastating in the near-term, experts told Fox News. Harvard could simply opt to fill the slots once taken by international students with any number of eager, well-qualified U.S.-based applicants, David Feldman, a professor at William & Mary who focuses on economic issues and higher education, said in an interview. Harvard is one of just a handful ofAmerican universitiesthat has a \"need-blind\" admissions policy for domestic and international students — that is, they do not take into consideration a student's financial need or the aid required in weighing a potential applicant. But because international students in the U.S. typically require more aid than domestic students, replacing their slots with domestic students, in the near-term, would likely have little noticeable impact on the revenue it receives for tuition, fees and housing, he said. \"This is all about Harvard, choosing the best group of students possible,\" Feldman said in an interview. If the administration successfully revokes their SEVP certification, this would effectively just be \"constraining them to choose the second-best group,\" he said. \"Harvard could dump the entire 1,500-person entering class, just dump it completely, and look at the next 1,500 [applicants],\" Feldman said. \"And by all measurables that you and I would look at, it would look just as good.\" Unlike public schools, which are subject to the vagaries of state budgets, private universities like Harvard often have margins built into their budgets in the form of seed money that allows them to allocate more money towards things they've identified as goals for the year or years ahead. This allows them to operate with more stability as a result — and inoculates them to a larger degree from the administration's financial hits. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Uncertainty is bad for them,\" Feldman acknowledged. But at the end of the day, he said, \"these institutions have the capacity to resist.\" \"They would rather not — they would rather this whole thing go away,\" Feldman said. But the big takeaway, in his view, is that Harvard \"is not defenseless.\" Breanne Deppisch is a national politics reporter for Fox News Digital covering the Trump administration, with a focus on the Justice Department, FBI, and other national news.",

    "article_text": "Fox News Digital gathered clips of President Donald Trump, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Speaker Mike Johnson discussing federal spending in the wake of Elon Musk’s accusations that they have turned their back on cutting the national debt. Elon Musk’sfiery feud with PresidentDonald Trumpspilled onto the top Republicans in Congress, where the tech billionaire questioned if their zeal to cut spending had disappeared. Musk launched into a social media assault this week against Trump’s \"big, beautiful bill,\" and accused Republicans of crafting a \"disgusting abomination\" full of wasteful spending. What started as a rant against the bill turned into pointed attacks against Trump, Senate Majority LeaderJohn Thune, R-S.D., and House SpeakerMike Johnson, R-La. 'HE'S NOT A BIG FACTOR': TRUMP'S SENATE ALLIES DISMISS ELON MUSK'S CALLS TO 'KILL THE BILL' Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., left, is signaling that some changes are likely to the House's version of President Donald Trump's \"big, beautiful bill.\"(Getty Images) The tech billionaire and former head of Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) lamented the bill as not cutting deep enough into Washington’s spending addiction. The House GOP’s offering, which is now being modified in the Senate, set a goal of $1.5 trillion in spending cuts. Musk set a benchmark of finding $2 trillion in waste, fraud and abuse to slash with hisDOGE initiative, but fell far short, hitting only $160 billion in his four-month stint as a special government employee. ELON MUSK WARPATH AGAINST TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' RATTLES HOUSE GOP Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., left, and tech billionaire Elon Musk.(AP) Still, he came with receipts, questioning whether Trump, Thune and Johnson were actually committed to making deep cuts. Below are moments from the campaign trail and recent months compiled by Fox News Digital where the trio affirmed their commitment to putting a dent in the nation’snearly $37 trillion debt. A common theme for Trump during his 2024 presidential campaign was to go after the Biden administration, and his opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris, for \"throwing billions of dollars out the window.\" The then-presidential candidate vowed that should he win a second term, his incoming administration would halt wasteful spending. \"We will stop wasteful spending and big government special interest giveaways, and finally stand up for the American taxpayer, which hasn't happened since I was president,\" he said. \"We stood up. Our current massive deficits will be reduced to practically nothing. Our country will be powered by growth. Our country, will be powered by growth, will pay off our debt, will have all this income coming in.\" GOP SENATORS EXPRESS 'CONCERNS,' 'SKEPTICISM' OVER TRUMP'S SPENDING BILL AFTER MUSK RANT Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., is leader of a 53-seat Republican majority in the Senate and faces concerns from some GOP colleagues about the size of the budget plan.(Reuters) Thune has agreed with his colleagues in the House GOP that the tax cut package needs to achieve steep savings, and believes that the Senate GOP could take those cuts a step further. After the bill advanced from the House last month, the top Senate Republican re-upped his vow to slash federal funding. \"It does everything that we set out to do. It modernizes our military, secures our border, extends tax relief and makes permanent tax relief that will lead to economic growth and better jobs in this country, and makes America energy dominant, coupled with the biggest spending reduction in American history,\" he said. \"So those are our agenda items, and that's what we campaigned on. That's what we're going to do.\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said he was \"surprised\" by Elon Musk's criticism of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.(Associated Press) Johnson had to strike a balancing act in the House to cobble together enough support behind the legislation, and struck deals and satisfied concerned lawmakers across the spectrum of the House GOP while still setting a goal of $1.5 trillion in spending cuts. Rooting out waste, fraud and abuse has been a continued mantra of the speaker and his allies. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"I said this is the beginning of a process, and what you're going to see is a continuing theme of us identifying waste, fraud and abuse in government, which is our pledge of common sense, restoring common sense and fiscal sanity,\" Johnson said.

Doctors told the former MLB pitcher — who played for the Colorado Rockies in 2008 and the Philadelphia Phillies in 2009 — that a liver transplant was likely his best chance of survival. MAN WITH STAGE 4 CANCER RAISES $150K FOR EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT \"When we first met with the doctors, they gave me a year to a year-and-a-half to live,\" Register said, adding that he and his wife, Beth, immediately started researching options. The couple traveled from Auburn, Alabama, to the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas, where Registerunderwent surgeryfor a temporary ostomy bag and began chemotherapy, per the SWNS report. \"When we first met with the doctors, they gave me a year to a year-and-a-half to live,\" said Steven Register, shown above with his wife, Beth.(SWNS) Plans for the liver resection were canceled when doctors discovered the tumors were too large, which led the couple to consider a transplant. Register's wife created a Facebook group to search for aliving liver donor, hoping someone would come forward in time. Kristin Johnston, a 40-year-old preschool teacher from Roswell, Georgia, saw the post and recognized Register as a former high-school classmate. The two had met in 1999 at Shaw High School in Columbus, Georgia, but hadn’t spoken in over two decades. ALCOHOL-RELATED LIVER TRANSPLANTS ON THE RISE AMONG YOUNG ADULTS, DOCTOR SAYS \"It was just so far out of left field,\" said Register, who couldn’t believe it when Johnston volunteered to donate part of her liver. He added to SWNS, \"I haven't seen or talked to her in over 20 years, and for her to reach out like that, it was just meant to be.\" Kristin Johnston, a 40-year-old preschool teacher from Roswell, Georgia, shown above, saw Register's Facebook post and recognized him as a former high-school classmate.(SWNS) Johnston said she started by doing a quick online search forlive liver donationand discovered that blood type compatibility was the first step. \"I just sent him a message,\" she said. \"I said, 'Hey, what's your blood type?' and he said, 'I'm B positive.'\" She responded, \"Wait, that’s mine, too,\" and offered, \"I’ll happily donate a lobe if I’m a match.\" HIV-POSITIVE TRANSPLANTS NOW PERMITTED FOR LIVERS AND KIDNEYS Johnston was later cleared as a match and received the confirmation on a meaningful day. \"I got the news on Good Friday, of all days, that I was officially cleared as his liver donor,\" she said. The surgery, which is expected to take 12 to 14 hours, will involve removing 70% of Johnston’s liver and transplanting it into Register, according to SWNS. Both her remaining liver and the donated portion will regenerate over time, giving both asecond chance at health. \"I got the news on Good Friday, of all days.\" \"For her, she is ultimately giving him the gift of life — for him, a really fresh start in this journey,\" said Beth Register.

Robert J. Kennedy Jr., said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital. \"Secretary Kennedy is committed to applying rigorous, evidence-based science to research efforts aimed at addressing these serioushealth challenges.\" FDA APPROVES FIRST AI TOOL TO PREDICT BREAST CANCER RISK In recent years, researchers have been actively investigating the potential of psychedelics, such as MDMA and psilocybin (\"magic mushrooms\") to treat mental health disorders. MDMA is not approved for clinical use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but can be studied in clinical settings. Psychedelics research has gained support from the Trump administration for treating PTSD and mental health conditions.(iStock) Psilocybin is listed as a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act, which means it has \"a high potential for abuse, [is not] currently accepted for medical use in treatment in the United States, and [has] a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision.\" Psilocybin-assisted therapy, however, is legal in Oregon, Colorado and New Mexico. Psychedelic medicines are \"showing real promise,\" according to Dr. Luke Twelves, general practitioner and vice president of medical for Lindus Health in London. Clinical trials have found such treatments safe and effective for patients battling seriousmental healthissues, according to Twelves. COMMON SUPPLEMENTS AND MEDICATIONS COULD CAUSE LIVER DAMAGE, STUDIES SHOW \"Take psilocybin, for example — it's demonstrating remarkable results for severe depression that hasn't responded to other medications,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"MDMA is showing similar breakthroughs forPTSD treatment.\" Clinical trials are also investigating how psychedelics could help with end-of-life anxiety, addiction,eating disorders, chronic pain and OCD, he added. In recent years, researchers have been actively investigating the potential of psychedelics, such as MDMA and psilocybin to treat mental health disorders.(iStock) Researchers have faced challenges in terms of regulatory hurdles and proper placebo controls, Twelves said. \"Given that these treatments could transform [the] lives of people suffering from conditions where nothing else has worked effectively, it's crucial that we complete this research properly,\" he said. \"The goal is to bring safe, proven psychedelic therapies to the patients who need them most.\" At President Trump’s May 1 cabinet meeting, Department ofVeterans AffairsSecretary Doug Collins said that \"we’re opening up the possibility of psychedelic treatment.\" RetiredArmy SergeantJonathan Lubecki recently told Fox News’ Alexandria Hoff that MDMA stopped his PTSD while he was participating in a clinical trial. The VA is now opening up to the possibility of psychedelic treatment to promote the health of veterans.(iStock) \"[I] took my first dose of MDMA. I've only taken it three times as part of the clinical trial, haven't taken it since, and haven't found the need to take it since, because I haven't had PTSD,\" he said.

FALLUJAH VET TURNS MEDAL OF HEROISM INTO A HEALING MISSION FOR FELLOW WARRIORS WITH SERVICE DOGS PROGRAM \"Preliminary findings have produced positive results on psychedelic-assisted therapies for treating mental health conditions,\" he said.

    "article_text": "Alex Rodriguez says Aaron Judge 'needs' postseason success to live in Yankee lore forever. For theNew York Yankees, it is always World Series or bust. Of course, the Bronx Bombershave 27 titlesto their name, and that includes a record 18-year drought from 1978 to 1996. But, after a new dynasty won four titles in five years, expectations changed once again. The Yankees, still, are a perennial postseason team, not having finished under .500 since 1993. Former MLB star Alex Rodriguez knew all about the expectations when he went from the Texas Rangers to the Yankees in 2004. Rodriguez made the postseason in all but three of his seasons with the Yankees (not including when he missed the 2014 season due to suspension). But today, he is part owner of the Minnesota Timberwolves and Minnesota Lynx.

The days of the Yankees winning four out of five years, those days are long gone, because the business models have changed, people are competing from a different point of view, the league structures are different, whether it's the luxury tax in baseball, there's different elements that are pushing and pulling,\" Rodriguez said in a recent interview with Fox News Digital. \"But I think that winning is more being one of the most respected organizations sports to treating your fans an impeccable way, your players or organization, and then your partners, your sponsorships and stuff like that, and then having a consistent winner that has an opportunity to strike every year. So I think when you think about winning and bust-or-nothing, it's more about the behavior of an organization versus just black and white winning a championship.\" But the Yankees still have All-StarAaron Judge, who, if it weren't for the Houston Astros' Jose Altuve in 2017, would be vying for his fourth MVP Award. His regular-season numbers are astonishing, but so are his postseason stats… in the opposite direction. Since the start of the 2022 season (entering Thursday), Judge has MLB highs in WAR (30.9), home runs (178) and OPS (1.124). But in October, he's hit just .205 with a .768 OPS. Rodriguez was polarizing in New York from day one — he was the superstar shortstop with the largest sports contract of all time who didn't exactly praise Yankees great Derek Jeter in a now-infamous quote — whereas Judge is much more universally loved, being a homegrown Yankee. However, that love is not unanimous because of Judge's postseason struggles. And if he wants to be forever in Yankees lore, Judge \"needs\" to find success in October, according to Rodriguez. \"I mean, I'm probably the one guy that can answer this from a personal experience more than anybody,\" said Rodriguez, who notoriously struggled in autumn with the Bombers before carrying the Yankees to their 2009 World Series title. Alex Rodriguez reacts after striking out during the game against the Los Angeles Angels at Yankee Stadium in New York on Aug. 13, 2013.(ap) MLB COMMISSIONER ROB MANFRED TO PROPOSE AUTOMATED STRIKE ZONE IN BASEBALL NEXT SEASON AMID POTENTIAL LOCKOUT \"I can tell you that for me, 2004 was just an absolute debacle, being up 3-0 against the [Boston] Red Sox and then losing four in a row. And for five years, I basically did not sleep comfortably, until five years later in ’09, we brought it home and dropped the hammer. So I think he needs a moment like that. I think he will get one. I think being part of the Yankees and that lore is you’re going to get cracks at it every single year. So that’s on his side, the talent’s on his side, and the more at-bats, the more reps he gets, the chances increase. And when he does, it’s going to be such an enormous win for everybody, and it’s going to be an elephant off his back.\" The Yankees, though, didn't exactly fare well in their World Series rematch last week against theLos Angeles Dodgers. They dropped two of the three games, including one contest where they were trounced 18-2 (both of the Yankees' runs came on solo Judge homers). Rodriguez is apartner with Lysol, which cleans up the stink — and the Yanks certainly could have used some in Los Angeles' Chavez Ravine. The ex-Yankees slugger recently surprised a local umpire in Miami Beach with some Lysol. \"Umpires are unsung heroes of the game, and it was great to show my appreciation for the work they do on and off the field,\" he said. \"Lysol is just an incredible company to partner with. We've had a tremendous partnership, and one of the things we want to do is make impact in the community and recognize people that often don’t get recognized.\" One player's impact that the Yankees are certainly missing is that of right-handed pitcher Gerrit Cole. And while the rotation has been a pleasant surprise, even with Cole's Tommy John surgery and Rookie of the Year Luis Gil's lat injury, an incomplete Yankees team is no match for the reigning World Series champs, Rodriguez thinks.

So that's one macro thought. And then obviously, the Dodgers have the Yankees’ number,\" Rodriguez said. \"It was great that they were able to salvage the series by at least winning one game and not getting swept. But look, when you have someone like Gerrit Cole hurt, the Yankees can still get through some pedestrian teams in the American League, but it's obvious that when you play the Dodgers, you need your full team and then some, and even that may not be enough.\" Follow Fox News Digital’ssports coverage on X, and subscribe tothe Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.",

Brad Marchandhad the potential game-winning goal for quite some time - when it was snatched away from him, he made up for it. The reigning Stanley Cup championFlorida Panthersevened up the final on Friday night with Marchand's double-overtime goal, giving the Cats a 5-4 win in Game 2 against the Edmonton Oilers. After scoring three goals during the first 12:37 of the game, Edmonton could no longer find the back of the net. In desperation mode and down 4-3, the Oilers pulled Stuart Skinner from the net with 2:33 left in regulation, which seemed early, but with the puck in the other zone on a faceoff, they could take advantage. And they did.

After allowing a goal on three of his first seven shots faced, Sergei Bobrovsky stopped each of the next 24 before allowing the one that sent the contest into overtime. Both teams had their chances in overtime, especially the Panthers, who hit the post on one shot and had a breakaway saved, but both teams were blanked. With just over eight minutes into the second overtime period, Marchand did it again, squeaking one by Skinner on a breakaway and giving Florida a tremendous win.

During another power play, Leon Draisaitl scored to give the Oilers a 3-2 lead, capping off five goals in the game’s first 13 minutes. While the Oilers' offense cooled off in the second, Florida’s did not. Dmitry Kulikov tied it up 8:23 into the period, and Marchand gave Florida the lead with a short-handed goal four minutes later.

    "article_text": "Charles Barkley calls the NCAA 'idiots' and 'fools' during an appearance on OutKick's \"Don't @ Me with Dan Dakich.\" A federal judge granted final approval on Friday to the $2.8 billion settlement that will allowcolleges and universitiesto begin paying athletes directly. Judge Claudia Wilkenapproved the settlementon Friday that will allow schools to pay their athletes next month. The sweeping terms of the so-called House settlement include approval for each school to share up to $20.5 million with athletes over the next year and $2.7 billion that will be paid over the next decade to thousands of former players who were barred from that revenue for years. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM A federal judge on Friday signed off on the $2.8 billion settlement between college athletes and the NCAA, clearing the way for schools to begin paying their athletes.(Mitchell Layton/Getty Images) Payouts will be determined based on the sport and the length of athletic career,with most footballand men's basketball players able to receive nearly $135,000 each. However, the highest estimated payout is expected to be nearly $2 million, thanks to \"Lost NIL Opportunities,\" according to the law firm. Nearly five years after Arizona State swimmer Grant House sued the NCAA and its five biggest conferences to lift restrictions on revenue sharing, Wilken approved the final proposal that had been hung up on roster limits, just one of many changes ahead amid concerns that thousands of walk-on athletes will lose their chance to play college sports. The deal covers three antitrust cases — including the class-action lawsuit known as House vs. the NCAA — that challenged NCAA compensation rules dating back to 2016. The plaintiffs claimed that NCAA rules denied thousands of athletes the opportunity to earn millions of dollars off the use of their names, images and likenesses.

    "title": "Mystery of America's 'Lost Colony' may finally be solved after 440 years, archaeologists say",
    "article_text": "Mark Horton, an archaeology professor at the Royal Agricultural University in the United Kingdom, spoke with Fox News Digital about his recent research that may reveal the fate of the Roanoke colonists. A team of researchers believes they may have cracked one of America's most enduring legends: Where did the settlers of theRoanoke Colonygo? The Roanoke Colony, also known as the Lost Colony, was the firstEnglish settlementattempt in the United States. A group of over 100 colonists settled on North Carolina's Roanoke Island in 1587, led by Sir Walter Raleigh. John White, the governor of the colony, returned to England for supplies in 1587. When he came back to Roanoke Island in August 1590, he found the settlement mysteriously abandoned – and all the colonists, including his daughter Eleanor Dare and his granddaughter Virginia Dare, gone. DIVERS UNCOVER MYSTERIOUS 2,500-YEAR-OLD SHIPWRECK, FILLED WITH UNUSUAL ARTIFACTS, OFF COAST OF SICILY One of the only clues remaining at the site was the word \"CROATOAN\" carved into a palisade. It either referred to Croatoan Island, which is now called Hatteras Island, or the Croatoan Indians. The mystery has haunted Americans and Brits for the past four centuries, with several investigations launched into the matter. Whether the colonists were killed by Native Americans, starved to death orleft for greener pastureshas eluded historians. After 10 years of research, an archaeologist spoke with Fox News Digital about his team's discoveries related to the lost Roanoke Colony.(Mark Horton; Croatoan Archaeological Society) But new research suggests the colonists' fate may not have been tragic after all. Mark Horton, an archaeology professor at Royal Agricultural University in England, spoke with Fox News Digital about his findings. \"This is metal that has to be raised to a relatively high temperature … which, of course, [requires] technology that Native Americans at this period did not have.\" For the past decade, the British researcher has worked with the Croatoan Archaeological Society's Scott Dawson to uncover the mystery. Horton said they've uncovered proof the colonists assimilated into Croatoan society, thanks to a trash heap.(See the video at the top of this article.) EXPERTS SHOCKED BY ANCIENT KING ARTHUR MANUSCRIPT FOUND TUCKED INSIDE BOOK: 'SURVIVED THE CENTURIES' \"We're looking at the middens — that's the rubbish heaps — of the Native Americans living on Hatteras Island, because we deduced that they would have very rapidly been assimilated into the Native American population,\" Horton said. The smoking gun at the site? Hammerscale, which are tiny, flaky bits of iron that come from forging iron. Horton said it's definitive proof of iron-working on Hatteras Island, which could have only been done by English colonists. The presence of hammerscale is definitive proof that the colonists moved over to Hatteras Island and lived among the Croatoans, according to archaeologists.(Mark Horton / Croatoan Archaeological Society) \"The key significance of hammerscale … is that it's evidence of iron-working, of forging, at that moment,\" he said. \"Hammerscale is what comes off a blacksmith's forge.\" ARCHAEOLOGIST SHEDS NEW LIGHT ON ASTONISHING DISCOVERY OF WRECKED SLAVE SHIPS: 'STRANDED ON THE COAST' Horton added, \"This is metal that has to be raised to a relatively high temperature … which, of course,[requires] technologythat Native Americans at this period did not have.\" The excavations took place on North Carolina's Hatteras Island, which was previously known as Croatoan Island.(Mark Horton / Croatoan Archaeological Society) Hammerscale shows that the English \"must have been working\" in this Native American community, according to the expert. But what if the hammerscale came longer after the Roanoke Colony was abandoned? Horton said that's unlikely. For more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle \"We found it stratified … underneath layers that we know date to the late 16th or early 17th century,\" he said. \"So we know that this dates to the period when the lost colonists would have come to Hatteras Island.\" \"It's a combination of both its archaeological position but also the fact that it's evidence of people actually using an English technology.\" Archaeologists say that the discovery of 16th-century English artifacts on Hatteras Island reveals the Roanoke settlers' fate.(Mark Horton / Croatoan Archaeological Society) At the site, archaeologists also found guns, nautical fittings, small cannonballs, an engraved slate and a stylus, in addition towine glasses and beads– which all paint a vivid picture of life on Hatteras Island in the 17th century. When asked if the colonists could have been killed in a later war, Horton said they survived among the Croatoans and successfully assimilated. \"We have one little snippet of historical evidence from the 1700s, which describes people with blue or gray eyes who could remember people who used to be able to read from books,\" he said. \"Also, they said there was this ghost ship that was sent out by a man called Raleigh.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER Horton added, \"We think that they assimilated into the Native American community and their descendants,their sons, their granddaughters, their grandsonscarried on living on Hatteras Island until the early 18th century.\" When asked if he's officially solved the mystery, Horton said that though the archaeological evidence is definitive, the legend will probably still endure. The colonists' fate may not have been tragic, and they likely assimilated into Native American society based on archaeological excavations, said an expert.(Mark Horton / Croatoan Archaeological Society) \"Have we solved the mystery? Well, you know, it's pretty good evidence, but there's always more work to be done,\" he said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Horton added, \"And people love mysteries. They hate resolving things one way or the other. So I'm sure that themystery will continue,you know, whatever the scientific evidence says.\" Fox News Digital's Brooke Curto contributed to this report.

The text threatens consequences, such as credit score damage, revoked driving privileges, suspended vehicle registration or increased toll fees, if you do not pay the bill you have supposedly incurred. To make the message appear legit, the scammers often include a date for penalties to begin, a fake administrative code and a link that appears to be an official DMV website.

    "title": "New mobile robot helps seniors walk safely and prevent falls",
    "article_text": "E-BAR operates as a set of robotic handlebars that follow users. The demographic landscape in the U.S. is shifting rapidly, with the median age now at 38.9, almost a decade older than it was in 1980. By 2050, the population of adults over 65 is projected to surge from 58 million to 82 million, intensifying the already urgent challenge of eldercare. With falls remaining the top cause of injury among older adults, the need for innovative,tech-driven solutionshas never been clearer. MIT engineers are stepping up to this challenge with E-BAR, a mobile robot designed to physically support seniors and prevent falls as they move around their homes. Join The FREE CyberGuy Report: Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts, and exclusive deals — plus instant access to my free Ultimate Scam Survival Guide when you sign up! An individual demonstrating the E-BAR.(MIT) E-BAR, short forElderly Bodily Assistance Robot, is not your typical assistive device. Rather than relying on harnesses or wearables, which many seniors find cumbersome or stigmatizing, E-BAR operates as a set of robotic handlebars that follow users from behind. This allows individuals to walk freely, lean on the robot's arms for support or receive full-body assistance when transitioning between sitting and standing. The robot's articulated body, constructed from 18 interconnected bars, mimics the natural movement of the human body, delivering a seamless and intuitive experience. AI ROBOTS HELP NURSES BEAT BURNOUT AND TRANSFORM HOSPITAL CARE The engineering behind E-BAR's mobility is equally impressive. The robot's 220-pound base is meticulously designed to support the weight of an average adult without tipping or slipping, and its omnidirectional wheels enable smooth navigation through tight spaces and around household obstacles. This means E-BAR can move effortlessly alongside users, providing support in real time, whether they are reaching for a high shelf or stepping out of a bathtub. An individual demonstrating the E-BAR.(MIT) BEST CREDIT CARDS FOR SENIORS AND RETIREES 2025 What sets E-BAR apart from previouseldercare robotsis its integrated fall-prevention system. Each arm is embedded with airbags made from soft, grippable materials that can inflate instantly if a fall is detected. This rapid response cushions the user without causing bruising, and, crucially, it does so without requiring the user to wear any special gear. In lab tests, E-BAR successfully supported elderly volunteers as they performed everyday tasks that often pose a risk for falls, such as bending down, stretching up or navigating the tricky edge of a bathtub. Currently, E-BAR is operated via remote control, but theMIT teamis already working on automating its navigation and assistance features. The vision is for future versions to autonomously follow users, assess their real-time fall risk using machine learning algorithms and provide adaptive support as their mobility needs evolve. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? An individual demonstration of the E-BAR.(MIT) TOP TABLETS FOR SENIORS: EASY, DISTRACTION-FREE AND WI-FI OPTIONAL The E-BAR project is rooted in extensive interviews with seniors and caregivers, which revealed a strong preference for unobtrusive, non-restrictive support systems. E-BAR's U-shaped handlebars leave the front of the user completely open, allowing for a natural stride and easy exit at any time. The robot is slim enough to fit through standard doorways and is designed to blend into the home environment, making it a practical addition rather than an intrusive medical device. MIT researchers see E-BAR as part of a broader ecosystem of assistive technologies, each tailored to different stages of aging and mobility. While some devices may offer predictive fall detection or harness-based support, E-BAR's unique combination of full-body assistance, fall prevention and user autonomy addresses a critical gap for those who want to maintain independence but need occasional support. The E-BAR.(MIT) HOW VR TECHNOLOGY IS CURING LONELINESS IN SENIORS Currently, MIT's E-BAR robot is still in the prototype stage and is not yet available for consumer purchase. The research team is continuing to refine the design and aims to bring it to market in the coming years, but it could take 5–10 years before the device receives full regulatory approval and becomes commercially accessible. Looking forward, the research team is also focused on refining E-BAR's design to make it slimmer, more maneuverable and even more intuitive to use. They are also exploring ways to integrate advanced AI for real-time fall prediction and adaptive assistance, ensuring that the robot can meet users' changing needs as they age. The ultimate goal is to provide seamless, continuous support, empowering seniors to live safely and confidently in their own homes. SUBSCRIBE TO KURT’S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES An individual using the E-BAR.(MIT) BEST FATHER’S DAY GIFTS FOR EVERY DAD What stands out about E-BAR is how it's designed with real people in mind, not just as a tech gadget. It's easy to see how something like this could make a big difference for seniors wanting to stay independent without feeling tied down by bulky or uncomfortable devices. As the technology improves, it could change the way we think about caring for older adults, making everyday life safer and a bit easier for everyone involved.

    "title": "Building your adventure: CIA veteran shares an inspiring story about courage with graduates",
    "article_text": "Students from McCallie School in Chattanooga, Tennessee, discuss the viral video on 'Fox & Friends.' One of the greatest joys about beingretired from CIAis the opportunity I now enjoy to immerse myself in our local community, especially the schools where my kids and their pals spend their days in class and on the sports fields. After all, freedom of opportunity in our glorious country starts with agood education. Around this time of year I'm always honored to speak with high school seniors who are about to take a momentous step forward toward building their own adventure. My message to them invokes one of the most courageous and inspirational people I've ever met, Gib Smith. Go forth, high school graduates, and take inspiration from the great ones around you.(iStock) I first met Gib in the late 1980s when we were assistant swim coaches for the Capital Sea Devils, based in Washington, D.C. In addition to coaching, we both swam the morning practice with the older kids ages 12 to 18 from 5 to 7 a.m. I'M BUILDING HOPE ON CHICAGO'S NOTORIOUS SOUTH SIDE Gib, who had swum all through high school and for James Madison University, was the fastest swimmer in the pool. He and I were both in our early 20s and from the moment we met, I admired Gib for being such a strong swimmer even though our days of competing in water polo and college swim meets were long behind us. But what made Gib's swimming prowess so extraordinary was that he was alsofighting cancer. Having been diagnosed with leukemia shortly after graduating from college, Gib would show up for practice even after having been subjected to arduous cancer treatment the day before. He inspired all of us, including future Olympian Tom Dolan, who was then only 12 years old and just starting to come into his own as a brilliant long distance and individual medley swimmer. I fondly remember good-naturedly teasing Tom, asking how it was that Gib was crushing him in practice even while recovering from another round of radiation. In 1988, Gib raised $12,000 for the National Cancer Institute by competing in the Chesapeake Bay Bridge swim race held each year in early June. Even while fighting cancer, Gib was building his own adventure. MAKE COLLEGE COMMENCEMENTS BORING AGAIN Adventure implies getting outside one's comfort zone, which is especially challenging for cancer patients. That's why Gib's story should resonate withhigh school graduatesas they take the next step in what can often feel like a daunting new chapter in their lives. First, few high school graduates have escaped some adversity in their lives, perhaps on the sports field, or God forbid as was the case for my own children, family trauma. But as British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said, \"If you're going through hell, keep going.\" In the words of my former boss at CIA Dave Petraeus, Gib overcame adversity by staying \"fit to fight.\" Swimming 6,000-yard practices each morning defined Gib's will to overcome adversity by never ever giving up. Second, high school graduates should already be thinking about connecting with something larger than themselves by making a valuable contribution to their community, maybe even to our nation or beyond. Gib was not only empathically thinking of other cancer patients, he also impacted the rest of us. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Anyone who might have been weary at the end of swim practice only had to glance over at Gib fighting through the pain with every bit of strength he had. We were all better swimmers because of him. And for years at CIA and now in retirement, there has hardly been a day that goes by when I do not think of Gib, and the shining example he set. Third, as they start preparing to makeimportant life decisions, high school graduates should be asking themselves this significant question: Why? In the words of my SEAL Team Six friends, Gib planned the dive and dove the plan. He was swimming through brackish Chesapeake Bay water overflowing with jellyfish that morning because that's how he chose to fight cancer and do his part to help others suffering the same cruelly arbitrary fate. We should strive to be honest with ourselves about the reasons for our big life decisions. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Gib successfully completed the grueling two-hour, 4-5-mile Chesapeake Bay Bridge race despite the frigid water and strong currents. He also beat cancer, earned a law degree,got married and had two children, who are now grown up and on to building their own adventures. So go forth, high school graduates, and take inspiration from the great ones around you as you choose your path in life's great adventure. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM DANIEL HOFFMAN Daniel N.

    "title": "What that citizenship contest reality show gets right",
    "article_text": "Former US attorney of Northern Alabama Jay Town outlines illegal immigrants' impact on the census on 'Fox Report.' It’s not clear that \"The American,\" the proposed reality TV show in which immigrants would compete to becomenaturalized U.S. citizenson the steps of the Capitol, will gain the cooperation of the Department of Homeland Security or ever see the light of day. But that hasn’t stopped it from being cast in a negative light. As the New York Times described it: \"Under Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, the (Department of Homeland Security) has often focused on publicity and reality-TV tactics to showcase PresidentDonald Trump’s hard-line immigration policies.\" In other words, it’s being cast as citizenship Hunger Games – though all the contestants would wind up on the fast track to naturalization. But that misses what’s fundamentally positive about it: the focus on citizenship itself as the goal. A group of people take the U.S. naturalization oath of allegiance to become citizens. (Getty Images) It’s a focus that’s been missing in all the attention rightly paid to the illegal and undocumented – the fact that citizenship is on offer to those who work hard and play by the rules and should be encouraged, just as it was once the case a century ago, when America assimilated its last big wave of newcomers. CONGRESS MUST REIMBURSE TEXAS FOR BIDEN’S BORDER SECURITY MALPRACTICE This would not and should not require some sort of amnesty for illegals. According to the Pew Research Center, there are 13.5 million fully legal immigrants who are not citizens but could be – yet we’ve averaged only730,000 naturalizations a year. A citizenship drive would help not just the new citizens but America. To become a citizen, one must swear to \"support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America \"and to bear arms to defend it.\" One must have some knowledge of what the Constitution says, in order to pass a written test – which is offered only in English. A wave of naturalization would make also our elections more fair. Per the Constitution, all congressional districts are based on their number of residents, not the number of citizens. That means that many Democrats from districts with large concentrations of noncitizen legal and illegal immigrants, have far fewer eligible voters in their districts than Republicans. IF WE CAN’T DEPORT ILLEGALS, HERE'S HOW WE CAN MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO STAY In Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s 14th District in New York, a whopping 46% of residents are foreign-born – and only 192,000 votes were cast in 2024. In Ohio Republican Jim Jordan’s 4th District, 96% of voters are native-born; 399,000 votes were cast last year. Keep in mind: noncitizens may not vote and have no voice in government. The Center for Immigration Studies has found that of 16 districts where more than one in four adults is not an American citizen, only one is represented by a Republican. These are, in other words, places where it takes fewer votes to win – and where Democrats hold the advantage. In light of the Trump vote among Hispanics, one cannot predict hownaturalized immigrantswould vote. As important as citizenship can be, there are real barriers – not just reality show theatrics – to achieving it. Taking the citizenship test costs $710 for each family member – and one must have studied 100 potential civics questions and be able to read English. TRUMP’S DESIGNATION OF CARTELS AS TERRORISTS ENDS THE FICTION THAT MEXICO IS A TRUSTWORTHY ALLY ESL classes are availableto be sure – but these can have long waiting lists and may be scheduled in the evening when immigrants are working night shifts. In Chicago, for instance, the public library offers a nine-week citizenship class in English only – and the  ESL classes you’d need first have waiting lists. But a new, nationwide citizenship movement is plausible – because the U.S. has a record of a successful one. In 1910, the foreign-born percentage of the population in the US (14.7) was roughly as big as it is today (15.6). The assimilation that ensued is too often cast as inevitable. But our civil society – not government – took steps to introduce immigrants to the American system and lead them to citizenship. The settlement house movement, started by Jane Addams, founder of Hull House, in a working-class Italian immigrant neighborhood in Chicago relied on volunteers who moved in and \"settled’ in immigrant neighborhoods and offered everything from nutrition classes to music lessons. They specifically prepared their neighbors to become American citizens. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION In her memoir \"Twenty Years at Hull House,\" Illinois-born Addams, a Quaker whose Republican father was a friend of Abraham Lincoln, wrote, \"Every settlement has classes in citizenship in which the principles of American institutions are expounded.\" The goal was to \"make clear the constitutional basis of a self-governing community.\" There were more than 400 such settlement houses across the country – all supported by local donors. It was a movement – andencouraging citizenshipwas part of it. There are some similar efforts ongoing today. In Reno, Nevada, the Northern Nevada Literacy Council pairs volunteers with immigrants – tutoring them in their homes by day because many work nights. They’ve helped many pass the citizenship test. In the village of Port Chester, New York – where immigrants from Central America have clustered – the George Washington Carver Center has added citizenship test tutoring by volunteers to its historic assistance for low-income Blacks. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The potential benefits of a national citizenship push were captured well by Lillian Wald, founder of the Henry Street Settlement on the Lower East Side. New immigrants, she wrote in her memoir, \"The House on Henry Street,\" \"bring an enthusiasm for our institutions.\" She dreamed \"of making his coming of age – his admission to citizenship, something of a rite.\" So it can still be. We should celebrate, not deride, a reality show that draws renewed attention to it.

    "article_text": "Special presidential envoy to Ukraine Ret. Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg discusses the latest with the Ukraine and Russia war after a deadly Russian attack on ‘America Reports.’ The massive Ukrainian drone strike on Russia has strong implications for the future of all warfare. The sophisticated operation taught us that the use of low-cost, highly scalable,lethal drone technologyis here to stay. Our leaders must pay attention, because the Ukraine-Russia war is a blueprint for not only how we will fight future wars but how we will have to defend ourselves from a more sophisticated and capable enemy than ever before. America’sdefenseleaders need to start reflecting on the realities of modern warfare and fully understand that, as a country, we are not ready. Some people still want to try and deny these very small, handheldfirst-person view (FPV) dronesthat cost only a few hundred dollars are not the future of warfare. They need to wake up. That’s the wrong mentality, and it makes the U.S. less prepared. In the case of theUkraineoperation, they utilized a few good sources, some cheap trucks, and low-cost drones with munitions that managed to destroy over 40 strategic bombers worth billions. Not millions, billions. UKRAINE CRUSHES PUTIN’S BOMBERS, BUT CAN CHINA AND RUSSIA DO THE SAME TO THE US? The U.S. government, on the other hand, will spend $10 billion dollars on an aircraft carrier that takes a decade to build and likely now could be destroyed by a modern-day swarm of unmanned surface vehicles, the same ones that have pushed the entire Russian Black Sea Fleet out of the Black Sea. A soldier of Ukraine's National Guard 15th Brigade launches a reconnaissance drone Leleka to determine Russian positions near the front line in Zaporizhzhia region, Ukraine, Monday, July 29, 2024.(AP Photo/Andriy Andriyenko) Ourdefense procurement prioritiesare misguided. The Russians, Ukrainians, Iranians and even the Chinese are starting to treat drones not like we typically do as surveillance. They treat them like they do artillery rounds. This is ammunition and ammunition needs to be produced in massive quantities. They collectively have their manufacturers producing millions per year, yet our government gets excited when a U.S. manufacturer can produce 100dronesa month. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The Ukraine operation should also highlight just how vulnerable we are as a country to similar attacks from our enemy.  Sadly, history has shown that the U.S. government will likely only change its archaic laws after we have a catastrophic attack on U.S. soil. Currently, we don’t allow for the needed widespread use ofcounter-droneand electronic warfare systems. We should be asking our leaders, why do we have to wait for fellow Americans to get hurt before doing something? UKRAINE’S SURPRISE ATTACK SHOWS IT MAY TAKE A ‘MAJOR DRONE STRIKE’ TO CHANGE US DEFENSE POLICY, EXPERTS SAY The truth is, we are not prepared defensively for what the state of drone technology currently is globally. People now easily have access to lethal capabilities at low costs that were before only allotted to first-world countries with massive budgets. The technology is proliferating at an alarming rate. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Thankfully, we have a few companies up to the task. Andy Yakulis, CEO of the defense startup Vector Defense, focused on preparing our soldiers for the next generation of drone warfare, told me recently that: \"We don’t have a drone technology problem, we have a contracting problem. We have a federal government and defense department procurement problem. Our defense industrial base is broken, and the big prime contractors just don’t get it and aren’t incentivized to adapt to this modern way of warfare because the money keeps rolling out to the same large defense contractors in from our government. We need to streamline the process for defense innovators, companies who understand the threats.\" He’s right, the technology and expertise in America exists today to stop future attacks and to protect Americans. We will never fight another war without drone technology and AI playing some of the most critical roles. We just aren’t moving federal government budgets quickly enough to fix it, and we need to before it’s too late.

    "title": "JONATHAN TURLEY: Not the homecoming Dems and Abrego Garcia hoped for",
    "article_text": "In audio obtained by USA Today from 2020, the wife of Kilmar Abrego Garcia asked a judge for a protection order, saying, \"he slapped me.\" (USA Today) Kilmar Abrego Garciais back in the United States, but he can hardly be thrilled about it. He has been returned not for a removal hearing, but for a trial that could result in a lengthy prison sentence, followed by immediate removal back to El Salvador. After the issuance of the federal grand jury, the United States is likely the last place on Earth that Abrego Garcia wanted to visit. Abrego Garciahad been fighting to return after he was mistakenly removed to El Salvador. That immediately drew irate orders from a federal judge, and many of us argued that the Trump administration should have simply brought him back for what seemed an easy case for removal after a hearing. KILMAR ABREGO GARCIA INDICTED ON HUMAN TRAFFICKING CHARGES, ORDERED TO APPEAR BEFORE JUDGE IN NASHVILLE Instead, the case dragged on for months after the Trump administration challenged the court orders as judicial overreach and unconstitutional. The indictment issued by a federal grand jury allows the administration to end the controversy on its terms. Rather than yielding to the challenged orders, it simply brought Abrego Garcia back to stand trial. It is an example of the old adage \"one day on the cover of \"Time,\" next day doing time.\" Sometimes notoriety can be your undoing. A courtroom sketch of Kilmar Abrego Garcia listening to his charges through an interpreter on Friday afternoon. Abrego Garcia, an illegal alien from El Salvador, faces human trafficking charges from the Department of Justice.(Paul Collins) If Abrego Garcia had been removed, little attention would likely have been drawn to his prior conduct. Indeed, as all the Democratic politicians, such as Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., arrived in El Salvador with an army of reporters, one has to wonder if Abrego Garcia was having second thoughts about his challenge. While news organizations like NPR described Abrego Garcia as a family man \"living quietly\" in Maryland, the facts proved far more damning. He was repeatedly accused ofbeating his wife. The court record also included allegations of his involvement in a notorious gang: \"Per the Prince George's County Police Gang Unit, ABREGO-Garcia was validated as a member of the Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) Gang. Subject was identified as a member of the Mara Salvatrucha MS-13, \"Chequeo\" from the Western Clique a transnational criminal street gang. This information was provided by tested source who has provided truthful accurate information in the past. See Prince Georges County Police Department (Gang Sheet).\" MS-13 is designated as a terrorist organization. Senator Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., the Democrat who has led the party’s advocacy for illegal suspected gang member Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, is celebrating his return to the U.S., saying, \"This is not about the man, it’s about his constitutional rights.\"(Fox News and Kevin Dietsch) Abrego Garcia was alsosuspected of human trafficking. Indeed, the description of the stop leaves one astonished that he was allowed to drive away. According to DHS: \"On Dec. 1, 2022, Abrego Garcia was stopped by the Tennessee Highway Patrol for speeding. Upon approach to the vehicle, the encountering officer noted eight other individuals in the vehicle. There was no luggage in the vehicle, leading the encountering officer to suspect this was a human trafficking incident. Additionally, all the passengers gave the same home address as the subject’s home address. During the interview, Abrego Garcia pretended to speak less English than he was capable of and attempted to put the encountering officer off-track by responding to questions with questions. When asked what relationship he had with the registered owner of the vehicle, Abrego Garcia replied that the owner of the vehicle is his boss, and that he worked in construction… The encountering officer decided not to cite the subject for driving infractions but gave him a warning citation for driving with an expired driver’s license. Abrego Garcia’s driver’s license was a MD \"Limited Term Temporary\" license. The encountering officer gathered names of other occupants in the vehicle but could not read their handwriting. The officer did not pursue further information due to no citation being issued.\" The videotape mystified many with how Abrego Garcia was allowed to go along his way. Here was an undocumented immigrant stopped with an expired license in a car with eight others traveling from Texas to Maryland. He gave a false statement, and the officer suspected human trafficking but let him go. It is alleged that the person whom Abrego Garcia described as his \"boss\" at a construction job was Jose Ramon Hernandez Reyes, an illegal migrant previously convicted of human smuggling. The black 2001 Chevrolet Suburban belonged to Hernandez Reyez. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Now,the indictmentdetails a broader array of evidence. The grand jury found evidence of extensive human trafficking violations over nine years. The indictment speaks of cooperating witnesses prepared to implicate Abrego Garcia in an international smuggling operation involving guns, narcotics, and humans that included over a one hundred such transports. \"Over the course of the conspiracy the coconspirators knowingly and unlawfully transported thousands of undocumented aliens who had no authorization to be present in the United States and many of whom were MS 13 members and associates The co-conspirators also worked with transnational criminal organizations in Mexico to transport undocumented aliens through Mexico and into the United States.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Ironically, in light of this indictment, any criminal defense attorney worth his salt would have opposed deportation to the United States from El Salvador. Instead, Abrego Garcia will face a much longer possible criminal sentence. He will eventually then be deported to El Salvador regardless of the outcome of the criminal prosecution.  Abrego Garcia never had a compelling basis for remaining in the United States. He gamed the system for years, a system that seems utterly incapable of dealing with this national emergency. He will get due process, but make no mistake about it. Abrego Garcia is back in the U.S., but it's no homecoming.

    "title": "BROADCAST BIAS: Networks downplay illegal immigrant's alleged antisemitic attack in 'sanctuary city'",
    "article_text": "CNN analyst Juliette Kayyem criticized the FBI for quickly classifying the Boulder, Colorado, attack on a pro-Israel gathering as terrorism. Violent crimes committed by illegal immigrantsare typically not considered \"newsworthy\" by ABC, CBS, or NBC. The subject is too \"Trumpy.\" Their collective reflex is to ignore each murder or injury as some sort of obscure local news anecdote that doesn’t rise to a national news story. On Sunday, June 1, an illegal immigrant from Egypt named Mohamed Soliman allegedly tried to kill Jewish protesters in Boulder, Colorado, who were advocating for therelease of Israeli hostagesheld by Hamas in Gaza. The first headlines from the networks were aerobically vague. NBC News drew the most social-media mockery for \"Multiple Gaza hostage awareness marchers injured in attack in Boulder. \"People\" were \"set on fire,\" it said underneath. Jews were just \"Gaza-hostage-awareness marchers.\" CBS’s vague headline — \"Attack atBoulder’s Pearl Street Mallin Colorado burns several people, police say\" — gave no indication that the assailant was antisemitic. MAINSTREAM MEDIA OUTLET SLAMMED FOR ‘DISGRACEFUL’ REPORTING ON FAMILY OF ALLEGED BOULDER TERRORIST The attack first drew police attention at about 3:30 pm Eastern time. On Sunday night’s CBS \"Weekend News,\" they began with the Boulder attack, but only stuck with it for about 40 vague seconds before moving to a story blaming Israel for shootings of civilians looking for food in Gaza. \"PBS News Weekend\" never mentioned Boulder on Sunday evening. Sunday night’s \"All Things Considered\" on NPR didn’t consider a segment on this. Video stills of a man later identified as Mohamed Soliman allegedly throwing an incendiary device into a group of pro-Israel supporters (off camera) in Boulder, Colorado, Sunday, June 1, 2025. Soliman was subsequently arrested by police.(Alex Osante) On Monday morning, the vagueness continued. The attacker was an \"Egyptian national\" and his victims were \"people\" in a \"peaceful crowd.\" Once legal proceedings kicked in, the specifics followed in Monday night’s coverage. Soliman reportedly confessed to police that he planned the attack for a year, and he wanted tokill all Zionist peopleand wished they were all dead, and he said he would do it again. CBS White House reporter Nancy Cordes suggested Trump and his aides were exploiting the attack. \"The president and the White House, more generally, they are using this case to hammer the Biden administration over its immigration policies, which they are arguing enabled the suspect to stay in the country.\" Anchor John Dickerson then asked Cordes what might have happened to the assailant under Trump’s border policies. She conceded it was \"unlikely\" he would have been allowed to enter the country and claim asylum. TIMELINE EXPOSES BOULDER SUSPECT'S MOVEMENTS BEFORE ALLEGEDLY CARRYING OUT FIREBOMB ATTACK ON PRO-ISRAEL GROUP On Monday, PBS White House reporter Laura Barron-Lopez also noted the information was \"seized\" for political benefit. \"President Trump today seized upon that on his social media, writing: ‘This is yet another example of why we must keep our border secure.’\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION By Wednesday night, the story had turned to the Trump administration moving to deport Soliman’s wife and five children, who are also illegal immigrants. As usual, a judge stepped in to delay it. While they usually highlight judges acting as the \"resistance,\" ABC, CBS and PBS barely touched on it. At least NBC devoted a full story to this. Reporter Morgan Chesky even relayed a video shared on a pro-Hamas Telegram channel, shot before Sunday’s attack, which showed Soliman saying in Arabic \"God is greater than the Zionists… than America, and its weapons.\" NBC could have aired a fuller, subtitled version of the alleged firebomber’s remarks to include \"Jihad is more beloved to me than my mother, wife, and children.\" That would seem relevant to the question of America deporting his wife and children. BOULDER TERROR ATTACK SUSPECT SAID HE WANTED TO KILL 'ALL ZIONIST PEOPLE,' USED MOLOTOV COCKTAILS: FEDS The networks didn’t talk about how the liberals who run Boulder proclaimed themselves a\"sanctuary city,\"protecting illegal immigrants from federal law enforcement. Daily Caller White House reporter Reagan Reese asked White House Press SecretaryKaroline Leavittabout that topic, but no one expected liberal networks would notice. NBC News drew the most social-media mockery for \"Multiple Gaza hostage awareness marchers injured in attack in Boulder. \"People\" were \"set on fire,\" it said underneath. Jews were just \"Gaza-hostage-awareness marchers.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP A week before the attack, the state of Colorado doubled down on its sanctuary \"protections\" in new legislation signed by Gov. Jared Polis, which underlined that, by nature, Democrats in blue states want to keep allillegal immigrants,including criminals, from being deported. This has been a disturbing trend inantisemitic attacksin recent weeks. On April 13, a man started a fire at Pennsylvania Gov.Josh Shapiro’s home. Shapiro is Jewish, and the suspect allegedly did the attack to support the Palestinian cause. And on 21, two Israeli employees were gunned down outside the Capital Jewish Museum. In each case, the networks covered the crime for a few days and then moved on.  It’s likely that these broadcast networks will be eager to put Boulder in the rearview mirror as well.

    "title": "VICTOR DAVIS HANSON: Trump and Musk need to reconcile for the sake of America’s future",
    "article_text": "'Kudlow’ host Larry Kudlow discusses the fiery exchanges between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump over the ‘big, beautiful bill’ on ‘America Reports.’ Editor's note: This essay is adapted from a tweet shared by the author. At first impression, it makes no sense that Musk would start firing away at the (admittedly imperfect) budget bill, or escalate to DefCon 1, by tweeting nonsense about impeachment, the Epstein files, or disengaging his successful space efforts from the U.S. agenda to stay preeminent in space. After all, he andTrumphave roughly the same enemies—the Left, that is now delighted at their quarrel—and the same general aims: to repeal the progressive cultural project, to restore meritocracy in lieu of DEI, to strive to ensure the U.S. is globally preeminent economically and militarily, to unfetter the economy, and to limit government intrusion. It is an irony of our checks and balances that an elected president, with majorities in both branches of Congress, still does not govern without compromise with hundreds of representatives and senators. WOULD DONALD TRUMP HAVE WON THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WITHOUT ELON MUSK'S HELP? Trump’s taskis now further complicated because, perhaps for the first time in U.S. history, he is also the daily target of a systemic attack by legions of cherry-picked, lower-court, liberal federal district judges, who find their five-minutes of liberal fame by issuing fiats not for their regional jurisdictions, but for all 340 million Americans everywhere. Musk, on the other hand, as the richest man in the world and CEO of his companies, can rule more by directives, in a way a president, the most powerful man in the world, simply cannot. What the White House may have wanted in the bill, and what it could reasonably achieve, were not always synonymous. Moreover,Musk knowsthat his nemesis is the Left, not MAGA, much less Trump himself. Trump was sincerely awed by Musk’s rocketry and his rescue of the astronauts. He befriended Musk because he admired his competence, similar candor, and even his eccentricities—and saw what his talents were doing and could do for the country. Musk, in turn, was moved by Trump’s defiance after nearly having his head blown off, and likewise, was appalled by what the Left had done to the border, in the blue-city downtowns, in Kabul, and anywhere subject to their anti-Midas touch. Musk knows that the leftwing California coastal commission tried to curtail his rocket launches, out of spite. The state bureaucraciesdrove Tesla out. Democrats tried to ruin him for hisvaluable work with DOGE. If the Democrats win the House, they will go after both Musk and Trump with endless subpoenas and nihilist Mueller-like investigations. (Musk should redirect right now to strategize with Republican House members about how to ward off a Democratic takeover). Tesla started bleeding because of a systematic leftwing effort to terrorize Tesla drivers, dealerships, and charging stations, and a Democratic-media-backed PR campaign to demonize the brand—all because Musk had aligned himself with Trump. So, Musk knows that Trump treated him fairly and gave him more latitude than any private presidential adviser since the friendship between the liberal Harry Hopkins (who moved into the White House) and FDR. What will likely follow? Hopefully a social media truce—followed by intermediaries restoring the friendship but spelling out the limitations and constraints on each that will result in a new less volatile, less intense, but more sustainable and mutually beneficial relationship for themselves and the country. Trump is now engaged in high-stakes diplomacy with some of the toughest, slyest, and meanest leaders in the world such as Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, and the Iranian lunatic theocrats. He cannot afford to reach out to Musk and thereby appear to his enemies that he backs down. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION But if Musk reaches out and wishes to look ahead and not nurse wounds, Trump can certainly be magnanimous and to his credit, signal that he holds no grudges for what was  said in the heat of passion, as he too looks forward to where and when he can help and be helped by Musk in the many areas where their aims are similar. The sane tech crowd, and most of the MAGA base, want an end to this aberrant Trump-Musk eruption. Over half the country concurs. Do not be fooled that the suicidal impulses of Democrats have neutered them. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Instead, we are witnessing an unprecedented,unhinged Democrat effortto use lawfare, big Democrat donors, street theater, congressional disruptions, potty-mouth videos, the administrative state, the legacy media, and discredited pollsters to stop the Trump agenda. It will only intensify as the midterms near. Unity, not discord, is needed now—and quickly.

Ina rulingtying together two recent cases, Judge Victoria Sharp wrote that generative AI tools like ChatGPT “are not capable of conducting reliable legal research.” “Such tools can produce apparently coherent and plausible responses to prompts, but those coherent and plausible responses may turn out to be entirely incorrect,” Judge Sharp wrote. “The responses may make confident assertions that are simply untrue.” That doesn’t mean lawyers cannot use AI in their research, but she said they have a professional duty “to check the accuracy of such research by reference to authoritative sources, before using it in the course of their professional work.” Judge Sharp suggested that the growing number of cases where lawyers (including, on the U.S. side,lawyers representing major AI platforms) have cited what appear to be AI-generated falsehoods suggests that “more needs to be done to ensure that the guidance is followed and lawyers comply with their duties to the court,” and she said her ruling will be forwarded to professional bodies including the Bar Council and the Law Society. In one of the cases in question, a lawyer representing a man seeking damages against two banks submitted a filing with 45 citations — 18 of those cases did not exist, while many others “did not contain the quotations that were attributed to them, did not support the propositions for which they were cited, and did not have any relevance to the subject matter of the application,” Judge Sharp said. In the other, a lawyer representing a man who had been evicted from his London home wrote a court filing citing five cases that did not appear to exist. (The lawyer denied using AI, though she said the citations may have come from AI-generated summaries that appeared in “Google or Safari.”) Judge Sharp said that while the court decided not to initiate contempt proceedings, that is “not a precedent.” “Lawyers who do not comply with their professional obligations in this respect risk severe sanction,” she added. Both lawyers were either referred or referred themselves to professional regulators. Judge Sharp noted that when lawyers do not meet their duties to the court, the court’s powers range from “public admonition” to the imposition of costs, contempt proceedings, or even “referral to the police.” Topics Anthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

This could be a big update, with a dramatic redesign design inspired by the Vision Pro — and more. Here’s a roundup ofthe most notable features rumored to be coming to iOS 19. Sources told Bloomberg thatApple plans to rename its operating systemsto reflect the release year rather than using version numbers. This means that iOS 19 will be renamed iOS 26, similar to how car model years are designated. This name change will also apply to other software updates, such as iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26. Anticipated to be the most significant design change since iOS 7, the operating system may feature a complete visual overhaul, one that’s reportedlyinspired byApple’s Vision Pro headset, according to Bloomberg. This could include translucent panels for navigation and circular app icons. The visionOS-inspired design will be made across Apple’s entire ecosystem (including CarPlay) with the goal of creating a more cohesive experience. Additionally, there are three apps expected to undergo the most changes — the Phone app, Camera, and Safari. For instance, the Phone app is rumored to introduce a new option that allows users to merge their favorite contacts, recent calls, and voicemails into a single view. Meanwhile, both the Camera app and Safari are anticipated to have more visual updates, such as a transparent address bar for Apple’s browser app. Apple is alsorumoredto be releasing agaming appthat will integrate Apple Arcade and the App Store’s game offerings, featuring a central hub for achievements, leaderboards, and App Store content. This comes after the companyacquired its first game studio, RAC7, according to DigitalTrends. Apple may also be developing an AI feature to serve as apersonal health coach. This new chatbot is expected to suggest lifestyle changes and provide health advice based on user data collected from the Health app. Additionally, the Health app may be revamped to include a food-tracking feature, allowing users to log their carbohydrate and caffeine intake. Apple could improve iPhone battery health withAI-powered battery management.This new feature is reported to analyze device usage and make adjustments to conserve battery life. There may also be a new charging icon on the lock screen that gives an estimated time for when it’s fully charged. Another rumor suggests thatreverse wireless chargingis being tested on the iPhone 17 Pro models, allowing users to charge accessories such as AirPods or the Apple Watch directly from their iPhone. According to9to5Mac, the Messages app is set to get an Apple Intelligence-powered translation feature that can automatically translate messages as soon as they hit users’ inboxes.9to5Mac also reports that Apple Intelligence couldpower a polling featurethat lets people in group chats vote and offers AI-generated poll suggestions. Additionally, Messages may also add the ability to set a background image, following in the footsteps of WhatsApp and Instagram. Apple maybring its Preview app from macOS to iPad and iPhone users, allowing them to annotate and edit PDFs. This will reportedly be a preinstalled app, per Bloomberg. As Bloomberg reports, Genmoji could gain a small yet exciting feature that allows users to combine existing standard emojis, such as a basketball going into a trash can. One notable absence from all the rumors is the impressiveSiri capabilitieshighlighted in Apple’s 2024 presentation, which featured a more context-aware assistant that can gather information and perform actions across different apps. The companystatedin March that the new features are delayed. While we can expect some AI-related announcements, the primary focus is likely to be on design changes. Reports indicate that improvements to existing Apple Intelligence features will also be introduced, along with some new additions.

Ina White House fact sheet, the administration claims that Biden’sExecutive Order 14144— signed days before the end of his presidency — was an attempt “to sneak problematic and distracting issues into cybersecurity policy.” Among other things, Biden’s order encouraged agencies to “consider accepting digital identity documents” when public benefit programs require ID. Trump struck that part of the order, with the White House now saying this approach risks “widespread abuse by enabling illegal immigrants to improperly access public benefits.” However, Mark Montgomery, senior director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies’ Center on Cyber and Technology Innovation,told Politicothat “the fixation on revoking digital ID mandates is prioritizing questionable immigration benefits over proven cybersecurity benefits.” On AI, Trumpremoved Biden’s requirementsaround testing the use of AI to defend energy infrastructure, funding federal research programs around AI security, and directing the Pentagon to “use AI models for cyber security.” The White House describes its moves on AI as refocusing AI cybersecurity strategy “towards identifying and managing vulnerabilities, rather than censorship.” (Trump’s Silicon Valley allies havecomplained repeatedly about the threat of AI “censorship.”) Trump’s order also removed requirements that agencies start using quantum-resistant encryption “as soon as practicable.” And it removed requirements that federal contractors attest to the security of their software — the White House describes those requirements as “unproven and burdensome software accounting processes that prioritized compliance checklists over genuine security investments.” Going back even further, Trump’s executive order repeals Obama’s policies around sanctions for cybersecurity attacks on the United States; those sanctions can now only be applied to “foreign malicious actors.” The White House says this will will prevent “misuse against domestic political opponents” and clarify that “sanctions do not apply to election-related activities.” Topics Anthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

Monday.Last year’s eventwas notable for its focus on AI, and this year, there is considerable pressure on the company to build on its promises, and tochange the narrativeafter months of largely negative headlines. As in previous years, the company will focus on software updates and new technologies, including the next version of iOS, which isrumored to havethe most significant design changes since the introduction of iOS 7. ButiOS 19 (or 26, if other rumors about the new naming system are true)isn’t the only thing the company will announce at WWDC 2025. Here’show you can watch the keynotelivestream. When Apple introduced a major overhaul to iOS back in 2013 with the launch ofiOS 7, it felt jarring for many users with the shift from the prior skeuomorphic design with gradients and real-world textures to the more colorful, but flat, design style that reflected Apple’s then chief design officer Jony Ive’s taste for minimalism. Now, new reports suggest that an upcoming redesign could provoke a similar level of reaction. Reports suggest the new design may have elements referencing visionOS, the software powering Apple’s spatial computing headset, the Apple Vision Pro. If true, that means the new OS could feature a transparent interface and more circular app icons that break away from the traditional square format today. This visual redesign could beimplemented across all of Apple’s ecosystem(including even CarPlay), according to Bloomberg, providing a more seamless experience for consumers moving between their different devices. According toBloomberg, Apple will announce achangein the naming system for iOS at this year’s WWDC. Instead of announcing the next version of iOS as iOS 19, Apple’s operating systems will shift to being named by year. That means we could be set to see the launch of iOS 26 instead, alongside the OSes for other products, including adOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26. While it might be challenging to top the news related toApple Intelligenceat WWDC 2024, the company is expected to share a few updates on the AI front. The company has seemingly been caught flat-footed in the AI race, making announcements about AI capabilities that had yet to ship, leading even someApple punditsto accuse the company of touting vaporware. While Apple has launched several AI tools like Image Playground, Genmoji, Writing Tools, Photos Clean Up, and more, its promise of an improved Siri, personalized to the end user and able to take action across your apps,has been delayed. Meanwhile, Apple has turned tooutside companies like OpenAIto give its iPhone a boost in terms of its AI capabilities. At WWDC, it may announce support for other AI chatbots, as well. With Jony Ive now working with Sam Altmanon an AI hardware device, Apple is under pressure to catch up on AI progress. In addition, reports suggest that Apple’sHealth app could soon incorporate AI technology, which could include a health chatbot and generative AI insights that provide personalized health-related suggestions based on user data. Additionally, other apps, such as Messages, may receiveenhancements with AI capabilities, including a translation feature and polls that offer AI-generated suggestions, per 9to5Mac. Apple will likely make the most of a number of smaller OS updates that involve AI, given its underwhelming progress. Reports suggest that these updates could include AI-powered battery management features and an AI-powered Shortcuts app, for instance. Bloombergconfirmeda 9to5Macreportthat said Apple is developing a dedicated gaming app that will replace the aging Game Center app. The app could include access to Apple Arcade’s subscription-based game store, plus other gaming features like leaderboards, recommendations, and ways to challenge your friends. It could also integrate with iMessage or FaceTime for remote gaming. Along with the new design, reports suggest that Apple’s other operating systems will get some polish, too. For instance, macOS may also see the new gaming app and benefit from the new AirPods features. It’s also expected to be named macOS Tahoe, in keeping with Apple’s naming convention that references California landmarks. Apple TVmay get a visual overhaul, but alsochanges to its user interface, the new gaming app, and other features. In addition to Messages getting a translation feature, Bloomberg reported that Apple could also bring alive-translate language feature to its AirPodswireless Bluetooth earbuds, allowing real-time translation during conversations. The iPhone will translate spoken words from another language for the user and will also translate the user’s response back into that language. A new report from 9to5Mac also suggests thatAirPods may get new head gesturesto complement today’s ability to either nod or shake your head to respond to incoming calls or messages. Plus, AirPods may get features to auto-pause music after you fall asleep, a way to trigger the camera via Camera Control with a touch, a studio-quality mic mode, and an improved pairing experience in shared AirPods. According to reports, the Apple Pencil is also receiving a new update, one that will benefit users who wish to write in Arabic script. In an effort to cater to customers in UAE, Saudi Arabia, and India, Apple is reportedly launchinga new virtual calligraphy feature in iPadOS 19. The company may also introduce a bi-directional keyboard so users can switch between Arabic and English on iPhones and iPads. There haven’t been any rumors regarding new devices, becauseno hardware is ready for release yet, according to Bloomberg. Although it’s always possible that the company will surprise us with anew Mac Pro announcement, most reports are saying this is highly unlikely at this point. Some reports indicate that Apple may also announce support for a new input device for its Vision Pro:spatial controllers. The devices would be motion-aware and designed with interaction in a 3D environment in mind, 9to5Mac says. In addition, Vision Pro could get eye-scrolling support, enabling users to scroll through documents on both native and third-party apps. Bloomberg hadreportedin November that Apple was expected to announce a smart home tablet in March 2025, featuring a 6-inch touchscreen and voice-activated controls. The device was said to include support for Home Control, Siri, and video calls, but has yet to launch.Following the discovery of afilingfor “HomeOS” by PMC’sParker Ortolani, speculation has arisen that Apple may unveilthe software for the device at WWDC.

Duh:During an interview atTC Sessions: AI 2025, Anthropic’s co-founder had a perfectly reasonable explanation for why thecompany cut access to Windsurf: “I think it would be odd for us to be selling Claude to OpenAI,” Chief Science Officer Jared Kaplan said,referring to rumors and reportsthat OpenAI, its largest competitor, is acquiring the AI coding assistant. Seems like a good reason to me! Everything is the same:Chinese lab DeepSeek released an updated version of its R1 reasoning AI model last week that performs well on a number of math and coding benchmarks.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Brad Menezes, CEO of enterprise vibe coding startupSuperblocks, believes the next crop of billion-dollar startup ideas are hiding in almost plain sight: the system prompts used by existing unicorn AI startups. System prompts are the lengthy prompts — over 5,000-6,000 words — that AI startups use to instruct the foundational models from companies like OpenAI or Anthropic on how to generate their application-level AI products. They are, in Menezes view, like a master class in prompt engineering. “Every single company has a completely different system prompt for the same [foundational] model,” he told TechCrunch. “They’re trying to get the model to do exactly what’s required for a specific domain, specific tasks.” System prompts aren’t exactly hidden. Customers can ask many AI tools to share theirs. But they aren’t always publicly available. So as part of his own startup’s new product announcement of an enterprise coding AI agent named Clark, Superblocks offeredto share a file of 19 system promptsfrom some of the most popular AI coding products like Windsurf, Manus, Cursor, Lovable and Bolt. Menezes’stweet went viral, viewed by almost 2 million including big names in the Valley like Sam Blond, formerly of Founders Fund and Brex, and Aaron Levie, a Superblocks investor. Superblocksannouncedlast week that it raised a $23 million Series A extension round,bringing its total Series A to $60 millionfor its vibe coding tools geared to non-developers at enterprises. So we asked Menezes to walk us through how to study other’s system prompts to glean insights. “I’d say the biggest learning for us building Clark and reading through the system prompts is that the system prompt itself is maybe 20% of the secret sauce,” Menezes explained. This prompt gives the LLM the baseline of what to do. The other 80% is “prompt enrichment” he said, which is the infrastructure a startup builds around the calls to the LLM. That part includes instructions it attaches to a user’s prompt, and actions taken when returning the response, such as checking for accuracy. He said there are three parts of system prompts to study: role prompting, contextual prompting, and tool use. The first thing to notice is that, while system prompts are written in natural language, they are exceptionally specific. “You basically have to speak as if you would to a human co-worker,” Menezes said. “And the instructions have to be perfect.” Role prompting helps the LLMs be consistent, giving both purpose and personality. For instance, Devin’s begins with, “You are Devin, a software engineer using a real computer operating system. You are a real code-wiz: few programmers are as talented as you at understanding codebases, writing functional and clean code, and iterating on your changes until they are correct.” Contextual prompting gives the models the context to consider before acting. It should provide guardrails that can, for instance, reduce costs and ensure clarity on tasks. Cursor’s instructs, “Only call tools when needed, and never mention tool names to the user — just describe what you’re doing. … don’t show code unless asked. … Read relevant file content before editing and fix clear errors, but don’t guess or loop fixes more than three times.” Tool use enables agentic tasks because it instructs the models how to go beyond just generating text. Replit’s, for instance, is long and describes editing and searching code, installing languages, setting up and querying PostgreSQL databases, executing shell commands and more. Studying others’ system prompts helped Menezes see what other vibe coders emphasized. Tools like Loveable, V0, and Bolt“focus on fast iteration,” he said, whereas “Manus, Devin, OpenAI Codex, and Replit” help users create full-stack applications but “the output is still raw code.” Menezes saw an opportunity to let non-programmers write apps, if his startup could handle more, such as security and access to enterprise data sources like Salesforce. While he’s not yet running the multi-billion startup of his dreams, Superblocks has landed some notable companies as customers, it said, including Instacart and Paypaya Global. Menezes is also dogfooding the product internally. His software engineers are not allowed to write internal tools; they can only build the product. So his business folks have built agents for all their needs, like one that uses CRM data to identify leads, one that tracks support metrics, another that balance the assignments of the human sales engineers. “This is basically a way for us to build the tools and not buy the tools,” he says.

    "title": "Doctors try 'poo pills' to flush out dangerous superbugs",
    "article_text": "UK doctors are attempting to clear dangerous superbug infections using \"poo pills\" containing freeze-dried faeces. The stool samples come from healthy donors and are packed with good bacteria. Early data suggests superbugs can be flushed out of the dark murky depths of the bowel and replaced with a mix of healthy gut bacteria. It is a new approach to tackling infections that resist antibiotics, which are thought to killa million people each year. The focus is on the bowels which are \"the biggest reservoir of antibiotic resistance in humans\" says Dr Blair Merrick, who has been testing the pills at Guys and St Thomas' hospitals. Drug-resistant superbugs can escape their intestinal home and cause trouble elsewhere in the body – such as urinary tract or bloodstream infections. \"So there's a lot of interest in 'can you get rid of them from the gut?',\" says Dr Merrick. The idea of poo-pills isn't as far-fetched as it might seem. Faecal transplants – also known  as a trans-poo-tion - arealready approvedfor treating severe diarrhoea caused byClostridium difficilebacteria. But scientists noticed hints that faecal transplants forC. difficilealso seemed to get rid of superbugs. New research has focused on patients who had an infection caused by drug-resistant bacteria in the past six months. They were given pills made from faeces which people had donated to a stool bank. Each stool sample is tested to ensure it does not contain any harmful bugs, undigested food is removed and then it is freeze dried into a powder. This is stored inside a pill that can pass through the stomach unscathed and reach the intestines where it dissolves to release its poopy powdery payload. The trialhas taken place on 41 patients at Guy's and St Thomas' hospitals in London to lay the groundwork for a large-scale study. It showed patients were up for taking a poo pill and the donated bacteria were still being detected in the bowels at least a month later. Dr Merrick says there are \"really promising signals\" that poo pills could help tackle the rising scourge of superbugs and that donor bacteria could be going to microbial war with the superbugs as they compete over food and space on the lining of the gut and either rid the body of them completely or \"reduce them down to a level that doesn't cause problems\". The study also suggests the array of gut bacteria becomes more varied after the therapy. This is a sign of good health and \"may well be promoting colonisation resistance\" so it is harder for new infectious bugs to get in. \"It's very exciting. There's a real shift from 20 years ago where all bacteria and viruses were assumed to do you harm; to now where we realise they are completely necessary to our overall health,\" says Dr Merrick. Earlier this week scientists showed the good bacteria our bodies meet – in the hours after we are born – seem to halve the risk of young children being admitted to hospital with lung infections. Our body's own human cells are outnumbered by the bacteria, fungi and others that live inside us - known as the microbiome. This has led to research implicating the microbiome in everything from Crohn's disease to cancer to mental health. If poo pills are proven to work against superbugs in larger studies then the researchers think they could be used for both treatment and prevention in people at risk. Medical procedures that suppress the immune system - including cancer therapies and organ transplants - can make the body more vulnerable. \"A lot of these individuals come to a lot of harm from drug resistant organisms,\" Dr Merrick. The UK's drugs regulator – the Medicines and Healthcare Products Agency – said there were more than 450 microbiome medicines currently in development. \"Some of them will success, so I do think we will seem them coming through quite soon,\" said Dr Chrysi Sergaki, the head of microbiome research at the MHRA. \"We could potentially, in the future, replace antibiotics with microbiome [therapies] - that's the big picture, so there's a lot of potential.\" The NHS app will be main way people also receive screening invitations and appointment reminders. NHS probes Brighton GP practice over gender care for under-18s and a support line has been launched. The stress and isolation of the pandemic has left social and emotional scars that are already being seen in children, but scientists also predict there could be huge economic costs. New technology at St Andrews University helps librarians detect when old books are bad for readers' health About 7,000 current and former smokers will be invited for a consultation and possibly a CT scan.",

    "title": "Trump-Musk row fuels 'biggest crisis ever' at Nasa",
    "article_text": "The row between Donald Trump and Elon Musk over a major spending bill has exacerbated uncertainty over the future of Nasa's budget, which is facing deep cuts. The space agency has published its budget request to Congress, which would see funding for science projects cut by nearly a half. Forty science missions, which are in development or in space already, are in line to be stood down. The president has threatened to withdraw federal contracts with Musk's company, Space X. Nasa relies on the firm's Falcon 9 rocket fleet to resupply the International Space Station with crew and supplies. The space agency also expects to use its Starship rocket to send astronauts to the Moon and eventually to Mars once it has been developed. Dr Simeon Barber, a space scientist at the Open University said that the uncertainty was having a \"chilling impact\" on the human space programme. \"The astonishing exchanges, snap decisions and U turns we've witnessed in the last week undermine the very foundations that we build our ambitions on. \"Space science and exploration relies upon long term planning and cooperation between government, companies and academic institutions.\" Aside from the feud between the President and Mr Musk, there is also concern about deep cuts requested by the White House to Nasa's budget. All sectors have been earmarked for savings, apart from an effort to send astronauts to Mars, which has received a $100m (£74m) boost. According to Casey Dreier, chief of space policy for the Pasadena-based Planetary Society, which promotes space exploration, the potential cuts represent \"the biggest crisis ever to face the US space programme\". Nasa has said that its request to reduce its overall budget by nearly a quarter \"aligns (its) science and technology portfolios to missions essential for the exploration of the Moon and Mars\". Dr Adam Baker, a space analyst at Cranfield University told BBC News that if these proposals are approved by Congress, it would fundamentally shift the agency's focus. \"President Trump is repurposing Nasa for two things: to land astronauts on the Moon before the Chinese and to have astronauts plant a US flag on Mars. Everything else is secondary.\" Those who back the proposals say the White House's budget has given Nasa a clear purpose, for the first time since the days of the Apollo Moon landings of the 1960s and 70s, when the aim was to beat the Soviet Union to the Moon. Nasa's critics say that since then the space agency has become a bloated, unfocussed bureaucracy which routinelygoes massively over budget in its space missions and wastes taxpayer's money. One of the most egregious examples of this is Nasa's new rocket for its plans to return American astronauts to the Moon, the Space Launch System (SLS). Its development has been delayed, and costs have spiralled such that it costs $4.1bn (£3.3bn) for each and every launch. By contrast, SpaceX's equivalent rocket system, Starship, is estimated to cost around $100m (£80m) per launch because it is designed to be reusable. Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin space company promises similar savings for its proposed New Glenn rocket. To no one's surprise, SLS will be phased out under the White House proposals, in the hope that Starship and New Glenn can take its place. But the past three development launches of Starship have been unsuccessful, and Blue Origin has only recently begun to test its Moon rocket. \"The worry is that Nasa may be jumping out of the frying pan, into the fire,\" says Dr Barber. \"The development of these alternatives to SLS is being bankrolled by Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. \"If they lose their appetite for this endeavor and SpaceX or Blue Origin say they need more money to develop their systems, Congress will have to give it to them,\" says Dr Barber. Of greater concern, says Dr Barber, is the potential loss of 40 missions to explore other planets and to monitor the impact of climate change on Earth from space, many of which involve collaborations with international partners. \"I think it is very sad that what has taken so long to build can be knocked down with a wrecking ball so quickly with no plan to rebuild it afterwards.\" The projects facing the axe include dozens of planetary missions already in space for which most of the development and launch costs have already been paid for, with relatively small savings proposed on their operating costs. Also under threat are two collaborations with the European Space Agency: An ambitious plan to bring martian rocks collected by Nasa's Perseverance Rover back to Earth and a mission to send Europe's Rosalind Franklin Rover to the red planet to search for signs of past life. Prof Sir Martin Sweeting, head of the UK space firm Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd, and co-author of aRoyal Society report on the future of spacesays that while the development was \"unwelcome\", there may be an upside for Europe as it takes greater responsibility for its own space exploration programme. \"Maybe we have been too reliant on Nasa the big player to carry a lot of the emphasis in space,\" he told BBC News. \"It is an opportunity to think about how Europe wants to get a better balance in its space activities.\" But there is much more downside for Europe in the short term. As well as the return of Mars samples and its Rover, ESA risks reduced access to the International Space Station if it is wound down, and the budget cuts cancel Nasa's extensive contributions to its successor,  the Lunar Gateway, a multinational space station planned for orbit around the Moon. In its recently published strategy ESAstated it \"will be seeking to build a more autonomous space capability, and to continue being a reliable, strong and desirable partner with space agencies from around the globe,\" with the implication that it would do so with or without Nasa. Also facing cuts are numerous current and proposed Earth Observation programmes according to Dr Baker. \"These Earth observation programmes are our canary in the coal mine,\" he told BBC News. \"Our ability to predict the impact of climate change and mitigate against it could be drastically reduced. If we turn off this early warning system it is a frightening prospect\". The budget proposals have yet to be approved by Congress. The planetary Society's Casey Dreier has told BBC News that many Republicans have told lobbyists privately that they are prepared to vote against the cuts. But, Mr Dreier worries that there is a strong possibility that political gridlock might mean that no budget will be agreed. It is likely that the reduced White House budget would be put in place as an interim measure, which could then not easily be reversed, because once space missions are turned off it is hard, if not impossible, to start them up again. Scientists are analysing the smells of space – from the aroma onboard space stations to planets hundreds of light years away – to learn about the makeup of the Universe. Researchers in the US and Japan are competing to explain the existence of the planets, stars and galaxies. The infrastructure of humanity's journey into space may only be decades old, but some of it has already been lost. Now, \"space archaeologists\" are scrambling to save what's left. Giant tyre firms are testing tyres that can survive conditions on the Moon and Mars. First Moon samples collected in nearly 50 years and loaned by China for the first time are now in the UK.",

The offensive remark was made last November during filming for the BBC dance show’s flagship Blackpool week,the Sun on Sunday reported. The BBC said his language was “entirely unacceptable and in no way reflects the values or standards we hold and expect”. The newspaper said that Borthwick, who plays Jay Brown - a key long-running character on the soap - apologised for \"any offence and upset\". BBC News has approached his representatives for a comment. Disability charity Scope said Borthwick should reflect on what he said and educate himself. \"We hope he takes the opportunity to get to know the reality of disabled people's lives,” said the organisation's media manager Warren Kirwan. Borthwick is said to have made the offensive remark on a phone video while backstage during rehearsals at the Blackpool Tower Ballroom. He reportedly used the term to describe the people of the seaside town. In his statement to the Sun on Sunday, Borthwick said: \"I want to apologise sincerely and wholeheartedly for the words I used in the video showing my reaction to making it through Blackpool week on Strictly.” He added: \"It is no excuse, but I did not fully understand the derogatory term I used and its meaning. \"That is on me completely. \"Now I am aware, I am deeply embarrassed to have used the term and directed it in the way I did.\" Borthwick rose to fame for his portrayal of Jay Brown (previously Mitchell) in BBC soap EastEnders. He has starred in it since 2006, making him one of the longest-serving actors on the show. He has won a British Soap Award for best dramatic performance from a young actor, and an Inside Soap Award for best actor. The 30-year-old took part in the latest series of Strictly, where he was paired with professional dancer Michelle Tsiakkas. It marked a return to the ballroom for him, after he won the 2023 Christmas special. He made it through to Blackpool week - seen as a key milestone in the contest - but was voted off later in November, making him the ninth celebrity to leave the show. His offensive remark is the latest controversy to hit Strictly, which celebrated its 20th anniversary last year. Last month, former contestant and radio hostWynne Evans announced he was leavinghis BBC Radio Wales show after the broadcaster \"decided not to renew\" his contract. He had been taking time off his daytime show after apologising for making what he described as an \"inappropriate and unacceptable\" comment during the Strictly live tour launch in December. Evans was previously taking time off his radio show after controversy around a remark he made. Dancer Kai Widdrington had a really promising football career ahead of him growing up in Stoke-on-Trent. Former EastEnders star John Altman interviewed the guitarist at a gig in Chatham in December 1967. EastEnders actor John Altman recorded the interview when he was 15 and is selling the memorabilia.

    "title": "Zia Yusuf returning to Reform UK two days after quitting",
    "article_text": "Zia Yusuf, who resigned as Reform UK chairman on Thursday, is to return to work for the party in a new role. Yusuf will lead what the party calls its \"Doge team\" – which is modelled on the Department of Government Efficiency set up by US President Donald Trump. Earlier this week, Yusufquit the party, saying working to get it elected was no longer \"a good use of my time\", without expanding further. On Saturday, Reform leader Nigel Farage told the BBC he was \"delighted\" Yusuf was had returned to the party and that he will now take on a more public role for the party in a new role, appearing more frequently in the media. He said: \"Zia regrets what he said and did the other day. It was a combination of 11 months hard work and exhaustion.\" In a post on X, Yusuf said he had received a large number of messages urging him to reconsider leaving the party and explained why he quit two days ago. \"After 11 months of working as a volunteer to build a political party from scratch, with barely a single day off, my tweet was a decision born of exhaustion,\" he wrote. Yusuf said he came into politics \"out of belief that Nigel Farage was the man\" to lead the country, adding \"I believe in these things more than ever\". Before his resignation, Yusuf had criticised Sarah Pochin, who won last month's Runcorn and Helsby by-election for the party. She urged Sir Keir Starmer to ban the burka \"in the interests of public safety\" during Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday. Yusuf said it was \"dumb for a party to ask the PM if they would do something the party itself wouldn't do\". A burka ban is not Reform party policy. Farage told the BBC that Yusuf, who is a Muslim, \"gets even more racial abuse on X than ever\" when Islam is discussed. \"In retrospect, he knows a lot of it is bots trying to damage Reform. It is not Reform members,\" he added. \"Yes, some of it is the alt-right, but there's a lot of bots. He regrets it and wants to continue working for us.\" Speaking to BBC News on Saturday evening, Farage said Yusuf would have a \"very clearly defined role\", and that his previous workload was \"way too much for anybody\". Asked whether Yusuf was burnt out, the Reform UK leader said that description would be accurate, adding:  \"I would credit much of the success we enjoyed on 1 May and since to his considerable efforts. \"Any discussion around Islam, terrorism, in this case the burka and he can't win. \"He is subjected to pretty vile abuse and... we're all human. He overreacted to it and he admits himself it was a mistake.\" Other parties have criticised Reform over Yusuf's reappointment. Labour described it as \"humiliating hokey-cokey\" and the Liberal Democrats called it a game of \"musical chairman\". But Farage rejected suggestions the episode showed the party was in disarray, saying \"we will emerge from this much stronger\". Yusuf - a former banker who sold his tech company for more than £200m, and was previously a member of the Conservative Party - became Reform's chairman shortly after last year's general election and was seen as central to the party's operation. The party's so-called Doge UK team, which was set up to identify spending cuts in councils the party now controls, was formally launched this week. Further appointments by the party are also expected soon in what it described as an \"expanded management structure\". A new party chairman is expected to be appointed next week and a deputy chairman will be hired too. Newbie councillors are navigating how to deal with other parties on councils in no overall control. Labour's Davy Russell won with 8,559 votes, a majority of 602 over the SNP. Nathaniel Fried resigned from Reform UK on Thursday, following Zia Yusuf's departure. Reform UK recorded their best ever parliamentary election result in Scotland - with a 26% share of the vote. The Conservative Party did not field candidates in the Norfolk by-elections.",

    "title": "Spending Review: cheques from chancellor for some - but what do totals hide?",
    "article_text": "The next few days are vital – \"one of the last moments to weave it all together – to look politically credible to the people Labour has lost\", one senior figure reckons. There have been huge fights inside government about the looming Spending Review. As I write, the home secretary and deputy prime minister are both still in dispute with the mighty Treasury over the amount of cash they'll have to spend. But the Treasury's already trying to convince the public the review is about significant investment. On Wednesday Rachel Reeves boasted of funnelling billions more taxpayers' cash to big transport projects outside the wealthier south east of England, having tweaked the Treasury rules to do it. Now, with five days still to go, I've been passed some of the information that'll be in the pages of Wednesday's review. It's one crucial chart that will be in the huge bundle of documents heading to the printing presses on Tuesday night that shows what's called TDEL – the Total Departmental Expenditure Limit. In other words, the total that government spends, including the day-to-day costs of running public services and long-term spending on big projects. But it doesn't include costs that government can't set in advance – like pensions and benefits, or debt interest. The chart spans 2010 to 2030, so takes in the coalition years, where you can see the total sliding down, then the Conservative years when spending starts rising after the Brexit referendum, then leaps up during Covid. And then, when Labour took charge, the red line going up steeply at first, then more slowly towards the end of this parliamentary term. The total real terms spending by 2029-30? More than £650bn – roughly £100bn more than when Labour took office. The pale blue line is what would have happened to spending if the Conservatives had managed to hang on to power last year. The government now is allergic to accusations that any cuts they make will be a return to austerity. And this chart shows that overall spending is going up considerably, compared to those lean years. The political argument around spending will rage but the chancellor did - to use the ghastly technical term – set out the \"spending envelope\" in her autumn Budget, indicating rises were coming. You can bet they'll want to use every chance they have to say they are spending significantly more than the Tories planned to under Rishi Sunak. The government's political opponents on the other hand, may look at that red line as it climbs steeply upwards and say: \"See, public spending is ballooning out of control\". This chart does illustrate very significant rises in public spending. But be careful. What this chart doesn't give us is any idea of how those massive totals break down. Massive chunks will go to favoured departments, suggestions of an extra £30bn for the NHS today. And a very significant part of that steep rise will be allocated to long-term projects, not running public services, some of which are struggling. The overall total may be enormous, but a couple of parts of government greedily suck in billions - others will still feel the pain. A case in point – as I write on Saturday morning, the Home Office is still arguing over its settlement, believing there isn't enough cash to provide the number of police the government has promised, while the front pages are full of stories about the NHS receiving another bumper deal. So observe this big health warning. The chart gives us a sense of the political argument the chancellor will make. But it doesn't tell the full story or give the crucial totals, department by department, decision by decision. It's worth saying it's incredibly unusual to see any of this before the day itself, hinting perhaps at jitters in No 11 about how the review will be received. Until we hear the chancellor's speech, and then see all of the documents in full on Wednesday, the story of the Spending Review won't be clear. There will be reams of statistics, produced by government, and the official number crunchers, the OBR, and then days of analysis by think tanks and experts in the aftermath. But bear in mind these three core facts. Rachel Reeves will put a huge amount of cash, tens and tens of billions, towards long term projects. Short-term spending money will be tight, with no spare cash for sweeteners.  And the government is not popular, so there's huge pressure to tell a convincing story to try to change that, not least because of what went wrong the last time. \"We can't ever do it like this again.\" After Labour's first Budget, government insiders concluded next time, it had to be different. A source recalls: \"It was a very brutal exercise - it was literally just making the sums add up, there was no collective approach to what the priorities were.\" Alongside a lot of extra cash for the NHS, there was a big tax rise for business that came out of the blue. No one wants a repeat of that experience. The \"next time\" is now – and a Labour source warns the review might be as \"painful as hell\" . So the task for a government struggling in the polls is to make this moment more than just a gruesome arithmetic problem, instead, to use the power of the state's cheque book to make, and go on to win an argument. Stick a fiver on Rachel Reeves referring back to that first Budget as \"fixing the foundations\" of the economy and public services, this week then being the moment to start, \"rebuilding Britain\". Sources suggest she has three aspects in mind: security for the country (which will explain all those billions for defence), the health of the nation - that does what it says on the tin, and \"investing\", all that cash for long-term projects. Next week's decisions will be followed soon after by the government's industrial strategy which will promise support for business, possibly including cash to help with sky-high energy costs. And it comes after several big staging posts – the immigration white paper, trade deals, the defence review. In government circles there's hope of denting some of the criticisms that they have been slow to get moving in office, that, frankly, Sir Keir Starmer arrived in government without having worked out what he really wanted to do. One Whitehall insider tells me, \"Now the buses are all arriving at once – maybe the idea of this lacklustre government that didn't have a plan will be blown away by July?\" Another Labour source suggests the threat from Nigel Farage has actually forced the government to get moving, visibly, and decisively: \"Reform gives us the impetus to actually shake this stuff down.\" That's the rosy view of how the chancellor might be able to play a difficult hand. It might not be reality. It is profoundly uncomfortable for a Labour government to make cuts. There is already a whiff of rebellion in the air over ministers' welfare plans. Expanding free school meals for kids in England seems designed to placate some of those critics in advance, but there could be more to make them mutinous. Don't forget Reeves has several different audiences – not just the public and her party, but the financial bigwigs too. This time last year all Labour's schmoozing was paying off, and she enjoyed good reviews in the City. One year on, that mood has shifted, in part because of the autumn budget. According to one city source,  it \"damaged her. People saw it as an about turn on her promises. Raising National Insurance, however they want to present it, went against the spirit of the manifesto… confidence in her in the City is diminished and diminishing\", not least because there is chatter about more tax hikes in the autumn budget. Sign up for theOff Air with Laura Knewsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you. You probably don't need me to remind you that the level of taxes collected by government are historically sky high. So too, at the other end, is the amount of government debt. A former Treasury minister told me this morning,  \"debt is the central issue of our time, nationally and globally\". \"There is a real risk our debt becomes unsustainable this Parliament, unless we make tough choices about what the state does. We can't keep on muddling through.\" Add in the twists, tariffs and tantrums of the man in the White House, that make the global economic situation uncertain and the picture's not pretty. But politics hinges on finding advantage in adversity. Polling suggests much of the country reckons Labour inherited a bad hand and has played it badly. This week, the chancellor has a chance to change the game. No 11 is determined to prove that she has made decisions only a Labour chancellor would make. And Reeves is gambling that her decisions to shovel massive amounts of money into long term spending helps the economy turn, and translates into political support well before the next general election. A senior Labour source said, Wednesday will be \"the moment, this government clicks into gear, or it won't\". There's no guarantee.

The paper says Washington has expressed concern because the location is near communications cables which could be attacked or targeted for espionage. A member of the US House of Representatives' China committee is quoted in the article as saying that even considering the construction of the embassy could be considered a \"curious error in judgement in London\".

    "title": "'I burst into tears': How airline carry-on confusion triggered legal row",
    "article_text": "Determined to avoid baggage fees for his holiday to Pisa, Benjamin Till trawled several different shops armed with a tape measure in search of the right suitcase. Eventually, he found a case within the dimensions EasyJet allows for a free underseat bag - or so he thought. When Mr Till arrived at London Gatwick Airport in December 2023, he discovered those measurements included wheels, meaning his bag was deemed slightly too big. He protested, but eventually paid £48 to bring the bag on board. He says he was told to remove the wheels for the way back - which he did. But at the gate on his way home, he was told the suitcase was still too large, so he sat on the floor, unpacking his dirty underwear and souvenirs into a bin bag. \"I don't mind admitting that I actually burst into tears because it was so humiliating,\" he says. An EasyJet spokesperson told the BBC its ground crew had to ensure non-checked bags were within maximum dimensions \"to safely and securely fit\", and that rules were made clear to customers when they booked. Stories of passengers caught out by baggage rules they feel are inconsistent or confusing are common, with many customers complaining or seeking clarity from budget airlines on social media. Different airlines have varying rules on the acceptable size and weight of an underseat personal item or an overhead cabin bag, with some charging customers to bring the latter. For people who fall foul of these rules, some airlines charge hefty fees to upgrade a bag from a free personal item to an overhead cabin bag at the airport gate, or to stow an oversized cabin bag in the hold. Passenger confusion has prompted the European Union's largest consumer group to push for fairer and more consistent hand luggage rules, and caused one government to start cracking down on airlines over bag charges. The EU is now looking at changing its laws - changes which would also affect UK passengers who are travelling to or from an EU destination using an EU-based airline. On Thursday, EU transport ministers proposed standardised sizing for free underseat baggage on EU airlines, among other air travel and passenger rights' changes - meaning this could become EU law if their position is accepted by the European Parliament. Budget airlines say their baggage policies comply with the law while keeping fares low, but they have been facing mounting pressure and calls for change. EU transport ministers proposed that passengers should be guaranteed one free personal item, measuring up to 40x30x15cm (including wheels and handles) - or which could reasonably fit under a plane seat. These rules would apply to EU-based airlines (such as Ryanair, Wizz Air and EasyJet), including when they are carrying passengers from a non-EU country like the UK to an EU country and vice-versa, but not third-party airlines. New rules would add clarity to an EU court ruling from 11 years ago, which stated hand baggage should not be subject to an extra fee, provided it met \"reasonable\" weight and dimensions, but did not say what reasonable was. Currently, Ryanair allows a free carry-on bag of 40x20x25cm, while EasyJet's dimensions for a free bag are a more generous 45x36x20 cm, including wheels and handles. The ministers' proposal was silent, however, on the issue of whether airlines could charge for overhead cabin bags – meaning that if their proposal was adopted into law, the current situation would not change and airlines could keep charging for that kind of hand baggage, which some in Europe have lobbied to stop. The European Consumer Organisation, BEUC, an umbrella group for 45 independent consumer organisations from 32 countries, believes Thursday's proposals do not go far enough, and legitimise \"charging for reasonably sized hand luggage\". In November, five airlines werefined a total of €179m(£150m) in Spain for \"abusive\" practices, including charging for hand luggage. Spain's Consumer Rights Ministry said at the time that it planned to ban charging extra for carry-on luggage and other policies. The airlines had said they would appeal the decision. Regarding charges for overheard cabin bags, Ryanair said it fully complied with EU law in its policy, which allows one small bag on board free of charge. \"If airlines were forced to include additional carry-on bags as part of the basic fare, it would reduce choice and drive up air fares for all passengers, which would harm consumers,\" the airline said. Industry group Airlines For Europe said charging different amounts depending on baggage \"allows passengers to choose the exact services that best suits their needs\". Hand luggage dimensions should be universal, says Jane Hawkes, a consumer expert specialising in travel. \"I don't really see why it can't be, and why they can't come to a voluntary agreement as to what those requirements should be for your baggage,\" she tells the BBC. \"There have to be restrictions, obviously, but a one-size-fits-all kind of approach would make it a lot simpler for passengers,\" she says. BEUC said policymakers should define what \"reasonable\" size and weight was \"to avoid surprises at the airport and ultimately reduce the number of disputes costing consumers and airlines time and money\". Ms Hawkes suggests passengers make sure they measure their bag after it is packed, as it may expand when it is full and go over the limit. She adds that consumers should not just be swayed by the fare price, as \"if you've got an airline that encompasses [baggage] without you having to pay extra costs to start with, then that might be more of a better option for you\". Mr Till would welcome a one-size-fits-all approach to underseat bags. \"It's just really, really unfair and ridiculous and there should be one size that goes across all of the airlines,\" he says. He also criticises the permitted size of underseat cabin bags, saying \"it was such a tiny, tiny size of luggage that you were allowed that it had taken me so long to find something that was so small\". Still, he was grateful for the inexpensive air fare, and the place he had to stay in Italy, because \"otherwise I wouldn't be able to come to this beautiful country\". The aircraft was flying to the US when the pilot reported an issue with the windscreen. From an underground network to an elevated railway, Leeds is no stranger to transport innovation. Oxford Bus Company says current levels of traffic are having a \"devastating impact\" on the city. Downpatrick, Newcastle and Ballynahinch bus services will operate from Belfast from July. The service will be run by the French airline, Finistair, from June to August.",

    "article_text": "Tatyana Popovytch had contacted every agency she could think of. She had walked every step her son Vladislav could have taken after the Russians opened fire at his car, leaving him to flee with a bullet in his leg. She had looked in mass graves, reviewed pictures of the dead, watched exhumations. And after a month, she knew no more than when she had started. Then a stranger called. Serhii had just been released from a Russian prison in Kursk. At morning roll call, the prisoners could not see one another, but they could hear each person state their full name and home village. Serhii memorised as many names and places as he could – 10 in total, he said – and on 9 May 2022 he called Tatyana to say that he had heard her son's voice. Like Vladislav, Serhii was a civilian captured from Bucha at the start of the war, when hundreds of civilians were taken from this area. Vladislav was 29 at the time. Now 32, he is still in the prison in Kursk. Serhii couldn't explain to Tatyana why he had been released and Vladislav hadn't. Tatyana was just glad to hear that her son was alive. \"I was so overjoyed I lost the stutter I'd had since he was taken,\" she said. Three years later, to the day, Tatyana was sitting in a café in Bucha, not far from where her son was abducted, looking over the scant evidence that he was still alive: two letters from him – short, boilerplate texts, written in Russian, telling her he was well fed and well looked after. Each letter had taken around three months to reach Tatyana, making it hard for her to feel very connected to her son at any point in time. \"My son is very gentle and sensitive,\" she said, with the pained expression of a parent who cannot protect their child. She was looking at pictures of Vlad ballroom dancing – a hobby from a young age. \"He is so vulnerable,\" she said. \"I worry that he will lose his sanity there.\" According to Ukrainian authorities, nearly 16,000 Ukrainian civilians are still in captivity in Russian prisons after being abducted by the invading army – not counting the more than 20,000 Ukrainian children estimated to have been taken to Russia. There are growing fears now among their many thousands of loved ones, amid the apparent progress towards peace talks, that they could be forgotten or lost in the process. And those fears appear to be justified. Under the Geneva Convention, there is a recognised mechanism for exchanging prisoners of war, but no such mechanism exists for the return of captured civilians, leaving even top Ukrainian and international officials searching for an explanation as to how they might be brought home. \"When I attend official meetings, at the ombudsman's office or elsewhere, no one talks about getting the civilians back in the event of a ceasefire,\" said Yulia Hripun, 23, whose father was kidnapped early on in the war from a village just west of Kyiv. In the weeks after learning of her father's captivity, Yulia used Facebook to contact another daughter of an imprisoned Ukrainian and the pair launched a new organisation to campaign for all the civilians' release. The group has met representatives from the UN, the European Parliament, the governments of several EU countries and the US embassy in Ukraine. \"We spoke with them but it came down to the fact that they honestly don't understand what's going to happen,\" Yulia said, of meeting the Americans. \"The only thing they said is that Trump is interested in the issue of deported children and that maybe civilians could somehow fit into that category. But they are actually different categories that can't be combined.\" Worryingly for Yulia and other relatives of the captured civilians, top Ukrainian officials are not pretending to have a stronger idea. \"I do not see the real, effective approach to returning the civilian detainees to Ukraine,\" said Dmytro Lubinets, the country's human rights ombudsman. \"We do not have a legal basis or the mechanisms for returning them,\" he said, frankly. Further complicating the problem is Russia levelling criminal charges against some of those captured during the invasion. \"And when you see these charges, it is often 'actions against the special military operation',\" Lubinets said. \"Can you imagine opening an investigation against a Ukrainian civilian for simply resisting the invading Russian army, on Ukrainian territory?\" In May, Russia released 120 civilian detainees as part of a larger swap of prisoners of war, and further exchanges are expected. But the numbers are still vanishingly small compared to the tens of thousands said to have been seized – adults and children. And great uncertainty remains over the path towards a negotiated peace. \"You want to believe he is coming home, at the same time you can't believe it,\" said Petro Sereda, 61, a bus driver from Irpin, near Kyiv, whose son Artym was taken prisoner more than three years ago. \"It is extremely difficult.\" Petro and his wife live in shipping container-style temporary accommodation in Irpin, because their home was destroyed in the invasion. Even three years on, every time the phone rings Petro thinks it might be Artym. \"It is one thing to have a letter saying he is alive, but to hear his voice… That would be the joy that he is really alive.\" The families live like this, in desperate hope. The dream is that they get to see their loved ones again. It is not a straightforward dream, though – some fear that Russian captivity will have caused lasting damage. Tatyana, whose ballroom-dancing son Vladislav was abducted from Bucha, said she shuddered to hear the Russian language now \"because it is the language my son is being tortured in.\" There is also the issue of what is missed. During Vladislav's detention, his father passed away unexpectedly at just 50, carrying a well of guilt that he was not able to protect his son. All Tatyana can do is prepare mentally for Vladislav's return. She expected to \"feel every possible emotion,\" she said. \"It is all I think about. All the time, every day.\" Daria Mitiuk contributed to this report. Photographs by Joel Gunter",

    "title": "Our mum went to jail for stealing our inheritance",
    "article_text": "Two sisters whose mother went from being their best friend to stealing their £50,000 inheritance say they have been left feeling anxious and unable to trust anyone. Katherine Hill, 53, from Alltwen in Pontardawe, Neath Port Talbot, and her 93-year-old father Gerald Hill from Fairwood in Swansea werefound guilty of fraud by abuse of power after a trial last year. They were sentenced to 30 months in prison and a 12-month sentence, suspended for 18 months, respectively. On Monday, Hill wasordered to repay the money, which was left to her daughters Gemma and Jessica Thomas by their grandmother Margaret Hill. \"I'll never have a relationship with my mother now,\" said Jessica. Swansea Crown Court previously heard, due to inflation, the sum stolen by the \"greedy and spiteful\" Hills was now worth about £65,000. Katherine Hill put the money in an instant access Barclays Everyday Saver account, despite being advised not to, and both she and her dad had cards to access it - draining the contents within a year. Between March 2016 and March 2017, the account where the money was held was emptied in 10 withdrawals, with £35,000 withdrawn in three transactions alone, the court heard. Gemma and Jessica grew up in Neath Port Talbot with their parents, and said Hill was a \"good mother\". \"She was like my best friend\", said Gemma, now 26, adding \"no-one saw this coming\". She said Hill did not have a good relationship with her own mother Margaret Hill - who split from her father when Hill was a teenager - though the girls did not know why. Margaret Hill died in 2014, while [Katherine] Hill was divorcing the girls' father, Chris Thomas. At the time Jessica was just 12 and not told about the inheritance, but Gemma, who was 15 \"understood a little bit more\". The £50,000 was placed in a trust fund with their mother as a trustee - to be accessed when they were 25. Following the divorce, the girls stayed living with their mother for about six months, but say she would often leave them alone for long periods of time while she visited her new boyfriend. \"It would start where she was going on dates and stuff. And I think I was at that perfect age of 'my mother's going out for the night, I can have friends over', and I was kind of loving it for a while,\" said Gemma. \"But it got to the point where it was happening every weekend and people expected that I wasn't going to have a parent at home, and I would be like, 'please will you stay home this one time?'.\" Mr Thomas decided his daughters would be better living with him, so the girls moved out of their family home and with him, while Hill moved in with her current partner, Phillip Lloyd. The sisters said their mum would sometimes take them out on a weekend, to a pub or McDonalds, but the conversation would often centre around their father and her upset that they left. \"I think she just could never get over the fact that we were choosing to live with him over her,\" said Gemma. Jessica said it was \"clear from then that we weren't really a very important thing to her\". \"I remember when she came to see me on my 13th birthday, and took me out for the day, saying she had to leave early because she was going out with [her boyfriend] and his family. \"It wasn't like she'd spend a lot of money on us... not 50 grand's worth, anyway.\" They said, looking back, there were signs of extravagance from Hill and her partner, such as building a back garden pub and hot tub, and going on holidays. But nothing set off alarm bells, as Hill had also received her own money from her late mother. Now, the girls said, they know it was really them paying for their mum's lifestyle. It was when Gemma phoned her mum to ask about accessing the money early, as she planned to buy their childhood home from their dad, that the claims the inheritance never existed began. She said her mum told her \"the money's not yours\" and blocked her number, before later claiming in court it had been posted through the girls' letterboxes. Jessica, who is now a nurse, recalled the shock of discovering the money existed, and then immediately that it was gone. \"How can you grieve something you never had? But [also] she's robbed me of an opportunity not a lot of people get.\" She and her boyfriend currently live with his parents, and she said saving up to move out without her inheritance would take a very long time. Gemma said she was angry, adding she found it frustrating the more time went on and the more Hill lied. She said the initial confusion and hurt was hard, given their happy memories of their mum, and the woman she saw in court did not seem like the same person. \"I'd sit there and be like, 'What if we're all wrong? What if she hasn't done it?' \"But I have to accept that she has.\" Gemma said giving evidence in court was stressful, but the relief came more from feeling validated, than from money or the sentences. \"When it actually was the case that she was being sent down... it was like we were being told that we're not crazy,\" she said. The girls said they saw people on social media claiming they were in prison with their mum and she \"was still saying that she was innocent\". \"And people would believe in her... that's the most shocking thing to me,\" said Jessica. \"Even though the relationship had started to break down before this, it could have possibly been fixed, whereas we're at that point now that we'll never go back to how we used to be.\" She added their mum had \"showed no remorse for anything she did\". \"She would look at me while we were standing up giving evidence, and she was shaking her head as if I was the one telling lies,\" she said. \"It's like she'll never take responsibility for what she's done.\" Jessica said she had been going to counselling for many years, to address \"massive issues with trust\", while Gemma said she became \"very needy in friendships\". \"[I thought] 'if my mother doesn't love me, who the hell is going to love me?'\" Now a mother herself to a two-month-old boy, she said she saw the betrayal on a new level. \"I came home [after court] on Monday and I was feeding my son. I was looking at him, and I was like, I could not go 10 days, not even 10 hours really, without knowing how he was or what was going on in his life. Never mind the past 10 years. \"It doesn't make any sense, she's missing out on all of that.\" Jessica was still living and working in the same area as her mum brought her anxiety and she lived with a tic, which a doctor told her had been triggered by trauma. \"The whole thing has just had a massive effect on me, mentally and physically.\" She added she did not know how they would have coped without each other, or their father, who supported them emotionally and financially through the long legal process. Now, with the result they wanted, they hope they will eventually see the money and \"let go of this part of our lives\". They say they want to forget their mother, and the end of court proceedings has brought a kind of closure, allowing them to \"finally breathe\". Bill Pallot and Bruno Desnoues falsified 18th-century furniture they said belonged to French royalty. Max Evans-Browning couldn't believe he got a reply after sending Sir David 99 animal pictures.

    "title": "Six killed by Israeli gunfire near Gaza aid site, Hamas officials say",
    "article_text": "Six Palestinians have been killed and several others wounded by Israeli gunfire in the latest deadly incident close to an aid distribution centre in southern Gaza, the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency says. People had gathered to collect food supplies on Saturday morning when the shooting started, a spokesman for the agency said. Reports quoting an eyewitness said the Israelis opened fire when people tried to advance towards the site. The Israeli military said it fired warning shots at suspects who approached them in a threatening manner. Dozens of Palestinians have been killed and hundreds injured trying to get to the distribution centre this week. The US and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) which runs the centre says it has paused its operations to deal with overcrowding and improve safety. But people have gathered nearly every day at a roundabout on the edge of an Israeli military zone, through which they have to pass to reach the aid site. In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said they had told Gazans the area was an active combat zone during nighttime hours. GHF said it had not been able to distribute food on Saturday because of direct threats from Hamas - something the group has denied. Whatever the case, the new incident will almost certainly strengthen international criticism of the new distribution model. The United Nations insists it puts Palestinians in danger and does not provide enough food and medicine to deal with Gaza's humanitarian crisis. Civil Defence spokesman Mahmoud Basal said at least 15 people had also been killed by Israeli air strikes on a residential home in Gaza city, with reports that some of the casualties remained trapped in the rubble. The Israeli army said the strikes had eliminated the head of a Palestinian militant group known as the Mujahideen Brigades. The Israelis have accused the group of killing and kidnapping some of the victims of the Hamas-led attacks on 7 October, including a Thai national named Nattapong Pinta. His body was recovered in the Rafah area of southern Gaza in a special operation on Friday. Israel recently began to allow limited aid into Gaza after a three-month blockade, prioritising distribution through the GHF. But the foundation has been mired in controversy. Medics and local health authorities reported more than 60 Palestinians were killed by gunfire over three days shortly after it started operating. Multiple witnesses blamed Israeli soldiers for the killings. The Israeli military said it had fired warning shots on the first two days and shot near Palestinian suspects advancing towards their positions on the third, adding that it is investigating the incidents. The distribution centre is one of four operated in Gaza by the GHF. It is part of a new aid system - widely condemned by humanitarian groups - aimed at circumventing the UN which Israel has accused of failing to prevent Hamas from diverting supplies to its fighters. The UN has denied these allegations, stating that it can account for all the aid it hands out and that the GHF's system is unworkable and unethical. It is almost 20 months since Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led cross-border attack, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 54,677 people have been killed in Gaza during the war, according to the territory's health ministry. Distinguished lawyers, senior humanitarians and diplomats tell Jeremy Bowen why they are increasingly concerned about the catastrophe inside Gaza The video sparked a backlash with critics accusing her of appearing to \"mock\" the 7 October 2023 attack. At least one Palestinian was killed and 30 others injured in the Israeli strike on tents in Khan Younis on Sunday, medics say. Israeli Americans Judi Weinstein Haggai, 70, and her husband Gadi, 72, were killed during the 7 October 2023 attacks. The Anglican Church, which runs al-Ahli hospital, condemns the attack that Israel says targeted a Palestinian Islamic Jihad operative.",

    "title": "Trump says relationship with Musk is over",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has said his relationship with Elon Musk is over. \"I would assume so, yeah,\" Trump told NBC News on Saturday, when asked if he thought the pair's close relationship had ended. He replied \"No\" when asked if he wished to mend the damaged ties. The comments were Trump's latest since the epic fallout between him and Muskunravelled on social media. It came after the tech billionaire - who donated millions to Trump's election campaign and became a White House aide - publicly criticised the president's tax and spending bill, a key domestic policy. A majority of Republicans have fallen in line behind the president. Vice-President JD Vance said that Musk had \"gone so nuclear\" and may never be welcomed back into the fold. Vance told podcaster Theo Von that it was a \"big mistake\" for the Tesla and SpaceX CEO to attack the president. For weeks, Musk had been criticising Trump's signature legislation - dubbed the \"Big Beautiful Bill\" - as it made its way through Congress. He said that, if passed, the bill would add trillions of dollars to the national deficit and \"undermine\" the work he did as the head of Doge, the Department of Government Efficiency, and its efforts to cut government spending. Shortly after leaving Doge after 129 days in the job, Musk posted on his social media site X  that the bill was a \"disgusting abomination\" - but did not criticise Trump directly. On Thursday, however, Trump told reporters he was \"disappointed\" with Musk's behaviour. Musk responded with a flurry of posts on X, saying that Trump would have lost the election without him and accusing Trump of being implicated in files of Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier who died in jail awaiting sex trafficking charges. He has since deleted the post and Epstein's lawyer has come out denying the accusations. Trump responded on his social media platform Truth Social, saying that Musk had gone \"crazy\". In one post, he threatened to cut Musk's contracts with the federal government. In his interview with NBC News on Saturday, Trump said Musk had been \"disrespectful to the office of the president\". \"I think it's a very bad thing, because he's very disrespectful. You could not disrespect the office of the president,\" Trump said. Musk, the world's richest man, who donated roughly $250m to Trump's presidential campaign, suggested during the social media feud that he might back some of Trump's opponents during next year's midterm elections, throwing his support behind challengers to the lawmakers who supported Trump's tax bill. When asked about the prospect of Musk backing Democratic candidates that run against Republicans, Trump said he would face \"serious consequences\". LA saw a second day of unrest on Saturday as protestors clashed with riot police. The city sees a second day of clashes over raids by federal agents on undocumented migrants. Salvadoran Kilmar Ábrego García, whose case became a political flashpoint, has been charged with human trafficking by US officials. The \"Devil in the Ozarks\" escaped on 25 May by wearing a disguise meant to \"mimic law enforcement\". The global celebration of the LGBT culture takes place near the White House after big shifts in US policy under Trump.",

    "title": "Trans ex-judge says gender ruling risks lives",
    "article_text": "The UK's only judge to ever publicly say they are transgender has told the BBC she is concerned the Supreme Court's ruling on biological sex puts lives at risk and fears \"someone's going to get killed\" because of it. Dr Victoria McCloud is planning to take the government to the European Court of Human Rights over the April ruling, which said a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities law. That led to the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)issuing new interim guidance to services and businesses on access to public facilities, such as toilets and changing rooms. Maya Forstater, of campaign group Sex Matters, said Dr McCloud's comments were \"alarmism\". Speaking to Laura Kuenssberg on Newscast, the BBC's daily news podcast, Dr McCloud said: \"This incident is putting lives at risk. I can't go out to the pub now, for example. It might not be the be all and end all of life but I am a lawyer. \"I've got to use the men's loos in a south London pub with a bunch of blokes who are drunk. I mean, come on. That's now government policy. Someone's going to get killed.\" Dr McCloud said she agreed with an argument put forward by \"the gender critical ideological movement\" that it is \"risky\" or \"at least rather intimidating\" to have a space designated for women, such as a changing room, that is occupied by men. \"But that applies to me too,\" she added. \"That danger is all the more if it is not going to be me and a bunch of women and one man, instead it's me - one woman - in an entirely male space in a drunk pub. \"That's absolutely clearly dangerous.\" Ms Forstater said: \"Women have already been assaulted and many, many are self-excluding because of the policy Dr McCloud endorses of allowing men to self-identify into women's toilets, showers and changing rooms. \"Where's the concern for the female half of the population who need privacy, safety and dignity? \"If McCloud isn't comfortable using male-only spaces, then there are usually gender-neutral options available. This is irresponsible alarmism.\" In the wake of the unanimous Supreme Court judgement, Equalities Minister Bridget Phillipson, speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme in April, stopped short of explicitly saying trans women should use the men's toilets. She said: \"The ruling was clear that provisions and services should be accessed on the basis of biological sex.\" Pushed further for clarification on whether a trans woman should use the men's or women's toilets, she repeated: \"The ruling is clear.\" The EHRC has already suggested trans people should use their \"powers of advocacy\" to campaign for so-called third spaces that are gender-neutral to avoid these sorts of dilemmas. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said in April the ruling gave \"much-needed clarity\" for those drawing up guidance. \"We need to move and make sure that we now ensure that all guidance is in the right place according to that judgement. \"A woman is an adult female, and the court has made that absolutely clear.\" Dr McCloud moved to Ireland after leaving her job as a judge last year and says she visits the UK only on essential trips. She said she is going to challenge the Supreme Court judgement at the ECHR, arguing the court did not hear from trans people before its ruling, and therefore breached her human rights. The Supreme Court did consider arguments on trans issues from the human rights campaign group Amnesty International, but not from exclusively trans activists.

    "title": "Ocean damage unspeakably awful, Attenborough tells prince",
    "article_text": "Sir David Attenborough has told Prince William he is \"appalled\" by the damage certain fishing methods are wreaking on the world's oceans. The Prince of Wales interviewed the TV naturalist ahead of a key UN Oceans conference which kicks off on Monday. The world's countries are gathering for the first time in three years to discuss how to better protect the oceans, which are facing growing threats from plastic pollution, climate change and over-exploitation. The UN's key aim is to get the High Seas Treaty - an agreement signed two years ago to put 30% of the ocean into protected areas - ratified by 60 countries to bring it into force. \"What we have done to the deep ocean floor is just unspeakably awful,\" said Sir David. \"If you did anything remotely like it on land, everybody would be up in arms,\" he said in the interview released on Saturday. It was conducted at the premiere of his new documentary, Ocean, last month. The documentary draws attention to the potential damage from some fishing practices, like bottom trawling, for marine life and the ability of the ocean to lock up planet-warming carbon. Governments, charities and scientists will come together at the UN Oceans Conference (UNOC) in Nice to try and agree how to accelerate action on the issues most affecting the world's seas. Sir David said he hopes the leaders gathering for the UN conference will \"realise how much the oceans matter to all of us, the citizens of the world\". The ocean is crucial for the survival of all organisms on the planet - it is the largest ecosystem, is estimated tocontribute $2.5 trillion to world economiesand provides up to80% of the oxygen we breath. The key aim for the UN is to galvanise enough support to bring the High Seas Treaty into force - including commitment from the UK. Three years ago countries agreed to protect 30% of the world's oceans by 2030, across national and international waters. International waters - or high seas - are a common resource with no ruling country so nations signed the High Seas Treaty in 2023 agreeing to work together to put a third of them into Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). Since then only 32 countries have ratified the treaty - 60 are needed to bring it into force. But many scientists and NGOs are worried MPAs will not be effective whilst practices like bottom trawling are still allowed within them. \"Our ocean is 99% of our living space on the globe, we have huge dependency on the ocean in every possible way, but bottom trawling does a lot of damage,\" Dr Amanda Vincent, Professor in Marine Conservation at The University of British Columbia toldBBC's Inside Science. Bottom trawling or dredging is currently allowed in 90% of the UK's MPAs, according to environmental campaigners Oceana, and the Environment Audit Committee (EAC) has called for a ban on it within them. But some fishing communities have pushed back on the assertion that certain fishing practices need to be banned in these areas. \"Bottom trawling is only a destructive process if it's taking place in the wrong place, otherwise, it is an efficient way to produce food from our seas,\" Elspeth Macdonald, CEO of Scottish Fisherman's Association told the BBC. Scientists point to evidencethat restricting the practice in some areas allows fish stocks to recover and be better in the long term for the industry. The conference had been called after concern by the UN that oceans were facing irreparable damage, particularly from climate change. The oceans are a crucial buffer against the worst impacts of a warming planet, absorbing excess heat and greenhouse gases, said Callum Roberts, Professor of Marine Conservation at the University of Exeter. \"If the sea had not absorbed more than 90% of the excess heat that has been added to the planet as a result of greenhouse gas emissions, then the world wouldn't just be one and a half degrees warmer it would be about 36 degrees warmer. \"Those of us who were left would be struggling with Death Valley temperatures everywhere,\" he said. This excess heat is having significant impacts on marine life, warn scientists. \"Coral reefs, for the past 20 years, have been subject to mass bleaching and mass mortality and that is due to extreme temperatures,\" said Dr Jean-Pierre Gattuso, senior research scientist at Laboratoire d'Océanographie de Villefranche and co-chair of the One Ocean Science Congress (OOSC). \"This really is the first marine ecosystem and perhaps the first ecosystem which is potentially subject to disappearance.\" The OOSC is a gathering of 2,000 of the world's scientists, prior to the UN conference, where the latest data on ocean health is assessed and recommendations put forward to governments. Alongside efforts on climate change the scientists recommended an end to deep sea activities. The most controversial issue to be discussed is perhaps deep sea mining. For more than a decade countries have been trying to agree how deep sea mining in international waters could work - how resources could be shared and environmental damage could be minimised. But in April President Trump bypassed those discussions and signed an executive order saying he would permit mining within international waters. China and France called it a breach of international law, although no formal legal proceedings have yet been started. Scientists have warnedthat too little is understood about the ecosystems in the deep sea and therefore no commercial activities should go forward without more research. \"Deep sea biology is the most threatened of global biology, and of what we know the least. We must act with precaution where we don't have the science,\" said Prof Peter Haugan, Co-chair of the International Science Council Expert Group on the Ocean.

    "article_text": "Dawn French has taken down a video she posted on Instagram about the war in Gaza, saying she apologised \"unreservedly\" for it. The video sparked a backlash, with critics accusing the actress and comedian of appearing to \"mock\" the 7 October 2023 attack that triggered the war. On Saturday,French acknowledged on Instagramthat the video \"appeared one-sided\", and said she never meant to \"mock, or dismiss, or diminish the horror\" of that day. \"I hope you will understand my intention was not to offend, but I clearly have. For which I am sorry and I have removed the video,\" she added. In the 40-second video, posted earlier this week, the Vicar of Dibley star shared her views on the ongoing war, saying: \"Complicated, no, but nuanced. But [the] bottom line is no.\" Switching into a high-pitched voice, she went on to say: \"Yeah, but you know they did a bad thing to us, yeah but no. But we want that land... and we have history… No. Those people aren't really even people, are they really? No.\" On social media, people were quick to criticise her, withactress Tracy-Ann Oberman sayingshe was \"so saddened\" by the post. \"This mocking voice 'bad thing' of October 7 that Dawn (who I revere by the way) appears [to] be mocking involved the most horrific terrorist attack involving rape, sexual violence, burning alive, child mutilation and taking of civilian hostages,\" she wrote. \"Why would Dawn seem to deny that which has affected so many of us personally in the most painful way possible.\" MP Rosie Duffield commented on Oberman's post, writing: \"One can, and should hate what is happening in Gaza and also condemn the hideous events of October 7th. \"It is agonising to see events unfold, and requires extremely careful, measured and well-considered comments and actions. This is not that.\" Meanwhile, screenwriter and activist Lee Kerncalled her video\"sneering mockery\". Responding to the backlash, French said that she had posted a video in the style that she has been using for social media \"in an effort to convey an important point\". She added that she had \"clumsily used a mocking tone\". \"My intention was NEVER to mock, or dismiss, or diminish the horror of what happened on 7 October 2023 and what continues to unfold from that brutal unthinkable, unforgiveable, savage attack,\" she said. She said her intention had been \"to mock and point the finger of shame at the behaviour of the cruel leaders on all sides of this atrocious war\". \"THEY were my target, but clearly I failed to do that, and that's on me. I apologise unreservedly, and I'm particularly sorry that my disgust at Hamas didn't figure. It appeared one-sided and that is wrong.\" Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led cross-border attack almost 20 months ago, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Some 54 of those captured during the attack remain in captivity, including 31 the Israeli military says are dead. At least 54,607 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 4,335 since Israel resumed its offensive on 18 March, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry. Israel's military says it was targeting an underground drone factory of armed group Hezbollah. At least one Palestinian was killed and 30 others injured in the Israeli strike on tents in Khan Younis on Sunday, medics say.

    "article_text": "Controversial influencer Andrew Tate has been caught speeding at 196km/h (121mph) in a 50km/h zone in Romania, officials have said. The British-American national was recorded driving at nearly four times the speed limit in a village about 184km from the Romanian capital, Bucharest. The 38-year-old received a fine of £310 ($420), in line with local traffic legislation, and had his driving licence suspended for 120 days due to the severity of the offence, police said. Tate has denied he was speeding and said he would appeal. The self-proclaimed misogynist and his brother, Tristan, are currently facing charges including rape and human trafficking in Romania, as well as separate allegations in the UK and US. They deny any wrongdoing. The brothers are allowed to travel in Romania, where they live, and abroad, subject to court-ordered conditions while their cases are pending. Andrew Tate was caught speeding on Saturday in the central village of Bujoreni, police said. They added in a statement that excessive speed remained one of the leading causes of road deaths in Romania. Tate later described the assertion that he was speeding as \"grossly false\" and said he would contest the matter in court on Monday. He wrote on social media that he had attempted to explain to the officer who stopped him that the radar gun - used by police to measure a vehicle's speed - \"must be calibrated incorrectly because I would never do this\". Tate said he looked forward to being proven innocent, and claimed he would \"enjoy full and normal driving privileges in the mean time\", despite the suspension. The elder Tate has often flaunted his collection of sports cars, including Bugattis and Lamborghinis, frequently posting photos of himself alongside them on social media. The former kickboxer has gained millions of followers online, where he has often mixed political messages with showcasing a flashy lifestyle. He has been caught speeding on numerous occasions in Romania. In April 2021, Tate was stopped in a town near Bucharest for allegedly driving a Porsche at 138km/h, according to local reports. A year prior, he had received a speeding fine in Germany. Several of his luxury carswere seized by Romanian authorities in 2023, as part of legal proceedings against him. Tate has reportedly criticised British police for refusing bribes during traffic stops, calling it \"offensive\". He has cited such attitudes as among the reasons for moving his businesses to Romania in 2017. A central theme in Tate's online messaging is the idea that an \"elite club\" of successful individuals live free from the challenges faced by others. Tate has stated that he escaped \"the Western world\" by moving to Romania, \"where corruption is accessible to everybody\". A fan site quoted him saying: \"If corruption exists, which it does, let us all play.\" British prosecutors have said Andrew and Tristan Tatewill return to the UK to face21 criminal charges - including rape and human trafficking - once proceedings against them in Romania have concluded. The brothers are also facing aseparate, civil lawsuitbrought by four women who allege they were coerced into sex work. Andrew Tate also facesa lawsuit in the USfrom an ex-girlfriend who accuses him of sexual assault. The brothers have characterised themselves as innocent in relation to all the cases against them. \"Fear managed to defeat fury\" is how one analyst interpreted liberal Nicusor Dan beating hard-right George Simion to the presidency.

    "title": "'We lacked seriousness' - Tuchel criticises England 'attitude'",
    "article_text": "England manager Thomas Tuchel was not happy with how England ended the game Thomas Tuchel criticised England's \"attitude\" and felt they \"played with fire\" in anarrow 1-0 World Cup qualifying winaway to Andorra. The Three Lions laboured against the world's 173rd-ranked side in Barcelona, squeezing out a third successive win through captain Harry Kane's 50th-minute strike to top Group K. Tuchel's men were jeered off the pitch at half-time and again at the end, leaving the England manager \"not happy\" with the disappointing display. \"I was most worried in the last 20 minutes because I did not like the attitude that we ended the game with,\" said the German. \"I didn't like the lack of urgency and it did not match the occasion - it is still a World Cup qualifier. We will let them know [on Sunday] what we want from them. \"I think we lacked the seriousness and the urgency that is needed in a World Cup qualifier. \"I think we played with fire. I didn't like the attitude in the end. I didn't like the body language. It was not what the occasion needed.\" England dominated the ball with 83 per cent possession, but frustratingly could not break down Andorra's well-organised defence and were mainly restricted to efforts from distance. Kane slid home the winner from a Noni Madueke cross for his 72nd international goal, but the Three Lions had few clear-cut chances. England next face Senegal in a friendly at Nottingham Forest's City Ground on Tuesday and Tuchel expects a better performance. \"I think we started well in the first 20 or 25 minutes,\" he added. \"We created a lot of chances and half chances, and we lost completely the momentum and couldn't get it back in the first half. \"Got a little bit [back] in the second half, but then ended up in a place that was not good enough in terms of urgency. \"We can just admit that, it's not what we expect from us. We need to look at it in detail and do better on Tuesday.\" Kane strikes as England struggle past Andorra in qualifier There were some mitigating circumstances for England's lethargic display. The match came at the end of a long domestic campaign for many of the players and was also played in hot and humid conditions in Barcelona - this fixture played there because Andorra's national stadium was unavailable after the recent Games of the Small States of Europe. But those watching clearly expected England to put in a more convincing performance against a side they had beaten six times previously by an aggregate score of 25-0. \"It looked like some of the players were bored in the last half an hour,\" former Manchester United and Republic of Ireland captain Roy Keane told ITV. \"Go and get some more goals and impress the manager who is still new to the job.\" Ex-England defender Lee Dixon added: \"They will be getting pelters no doubt about that. \"When you are fourth [in the rankings] and they are 173rd you expect to beat them handsomely, but that wasn't the case.\" Former Manchester City midfielder Michael Brown agreed the performance was poor, but the priority was to get the job done in the bid for qualification to next year's finals. \"It was a big disappointment but they did the job and won the game,\" he said on BBC Radio 5 Live. \"It could have been a lot more convincing in attacking positions. There is going to be criticism because of the team we were up against, but it is job done, move on to the next one.\" Jordan Henderson started his first England game since November 2023 Tuchel made five changes from the England team that beat Latvia 3-0 at Wembley in March and played Liverpool midfielder Curtis Jones at right-back and Reece James at left-back as he tried to make the most of England's control of the ball. And the 51-year-old handed a surprise start to Ajax midfielder Jordan Henderson, his first for his country since 17 November, 2023. Declan Rice, one of England's key players came off the bench in the 81st minute as Tuchel used the match to have a look at options within his squad. \"Declan [Rice] looked a little bit out of rhythm and I think Jordan [Henderson] deserved to play.\" said the England boss. \"And also for what Jordan brings to this group, well deserved. \"We started well and then lost the rhythm and precision and also the energy to be more decisive and score more goals. \"It is necessary that we look at it and then present in detail to the players what we don't like, what we want to do better and what are the standards.\" Noni Madueke earned his sixth England cap Chelsea winger Madueke has had a bright start to his England career. The 23-year-old registered an assist on his Three Lions debut against Finland last September, and his pass for Kane's winner was his third in six international appearances. England tried to use his pace to get behind the Andorra defence and Madueke was constantly positive on the ball, repeatedly trying to beat his man. He created the most chances with four, and also had the most touches in the opposition box of any player (12). \"He was, over the course of the match, the most dangerous. I could feel his hunger to do what was the plan throughout the whole of the match.\" said Tuchel. \"The message got across because we had a good 25 minutes, but then the energy and the determination weren't there anymore. Then it looks like it does.\" Madueke started the match on the left wing to give England width, the opposite side to where he usually plays for Chelsea. His display could give him a chance of making the position his own as no-one in the England squad has regularly been able to shine in that spot.

    "title": "Six games, six wins - but what have England learned?",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played England beat West Indies to complete ODI series clean sweep - highlights Charlotte Edwards was tasked with rebuilding England after a brutal Ashes drubbing which resulted in heavy criticism of the team's attitude, culture and on-field performances. The legendary former captain has started her era as head coach with a T20 and one-day international clean sweep over a depleted West Indies side, but this was no surprise. Ultimately, Edwards and new captain Nat Sciver-Brunt could not have asked for an easier start to their tenure. Edwards' predecessor Jon Lewis also began his stint as head coach with a clean sweep over the Windies away from home, creating a sense of optimism and excitement before it all came crashing down with two disappointing T20 World Cup campaigns and the ill-fated Ashes series to start this year. So this series win comes with a word of caution - we have seen this one before. England have regularly dominated home bilateral series, and then crumbled on the big stage. Prior to this series, they had won 79.3% of their completed white-ball games at home since 2020, and that number rises to 87.8% when you take out Australia and India. There are much tougher tests to come, starting with India's arrival in late June before the very challenging prospect of a 50-over World Cup in India and Sri Lanka at the end of September. World Cup-winning spinner Alex Hartley says that England are in a \"good place\" because of the dominant manner in which they have been winning, but has this series provided anything to suggest things will be different and whether the \"new\" England can finally perform under pressure when it matters? Ecclestone to take break to 'prioritise wellbeing' Ruthless England seal series clean sweep v Windies England women beat the rain and West Indies to seal series clean sweep This video can not be played 'Outstanding innings' - Jones makes second century in consecutive matches When she was appointed, Edwards made it clear that 50-over cricket would be her initial priority, saying that England needed a smarter gameplan and to improve their awareness, particularly with the bat. Her first move was to promote wicketkeeper Amy Jones back to opener alongside Tammy Beaumont, a role she fulfilled in 22 matches between 2016 and 2019. Jones certainly repaid Edwards' faith with a player of the series performance - scoring her first international hundred in her 246th match and then backing it up in the second game to finish with 251 runs at an average of 125.50 and impressive strike-rate of 114.61. But the challenge for Jones mirrors England's generally - can she step up against higher-quality opposition? Her average of 55.45 against West Indies is her highest against any team, but that drops to 16.33 against Australia and 19.66 against India. One aspect to consider is how teams may adapt to her success and how she'll fare in different conditions in India. How would Jones perform if a side was to start with spin against her, for example? She averages 36.2 against spin and has a strike-rate of 82, both of which are more than respectable. The 31-year-old has only faced 35 balls of spin in the 10-over powerplay but is yet to be dismissed. She can be a slow starter against spin though, being dismissed 10 times by a spinner in her first 30 balls and her strike-rate drops to 78. Her record with Beaumont suggests they are a natural fit for the top-order rebuild which was needed after Maia Bouchier's misery in Australia where she averaged six. Jones and Beaumont are England's third-most successful ODI partnership, scoring 1,786 runs together in 30 innings while their average of 63.8 is comfortably the highest in the current team. Heather Knight and Sciver-Brunt are behind them with 42.8. Though West Indies generally offered England very little challenge, the most effective way of judging where they are at as a team is to see how they fared against one of the world's best players in Hayley Matthews. Without fellow all-rounders Deandra Dottin or Chinelle Henry in the squad, West Indies' hopes relied solely on their captain and more often than not, she keeps them afloat. And it is cause for concern that England have not performed well against the one player who can consistently put their bowlers under the pump and provide a significant contest. Matthews missed thesecond and third ODIs with a shoulder problem, having made a fluent 48 and taken 2-49 in the first, but was magnificent in the T20s. She scored a sparkling century in a total of 146 in the opener at Canterbury, fell cheaply in the second at Hove before scoring 71 and taking 3-32 in the third at Chelmsford. Against India, there are plenty of players capable of such performances - Smriti Mandhana, Shafali Verma, Jemimah Rodrigues and Harmanpreet Kaur to name a few. It will not be the same case of taking one wicket to define a game, and Matthews' efforts suggest this is a challenge they are desperately in need of. \"I think we've probably created it ourselves in many ways,\" Edwards said when asked about whether her side had been put under any pressure during the series. \"Competition for selection in county cricket, going into county cricket and having to perform, and then obviously within this side now, making sure they are taking the opportunities.\" This video can not be played Bell catches Campbelle out at backward point The world's number one-ranked bowler Sophie Ecclestone made headlines during the Ashes after herrefusal to do a pre-match interview with former team-mate Hartley, who had criticised England's fitness after their T20 World Cup exit. The 26-year-old was left out for the West Indies series as part of her recovery from a knee injury, but has since played two 50-over matches and six T20s for Lancashire, and England insisted her omission was not in relation to the winter's controversy. She has sincetaken a break from domestic cricketto prioritise her wellbeing and to manage a quad problem, but remains available for selection for the India series. In her absence, however, fellow left-arm spinner Linsey Smith has shone with seven wickets in two matches including a five-wicket haul on her ODI debut which has left Edwards with a pretty significant selection headache, but a luxurious one. There is no reason why England could not play two left-arm spinners, particularly given they offer such different attributes. Ecclestone's height generates a lot more bounce, while Smith is skiddier and her strength comes from her accuracy. In the two ODIs she played, Smith would have hit the stumps with a series-high 45.8% of deliveries and her economy rate of 3.15 runs per over was comfortably the lowest. England's spin trio of Ecclestone, off-spinner Charlie Dean and leg-spinner Sarah Glenn have played together 25 times in T20s but only twice in ODIs. The World Cup in India, though, could provide further opportunity for Smith when she has previously been kept out of the side because of Ecclestone's brilliance standing in her way. Edwards called for greater competition for places, after accusations of complacency followed the Ashes, and this has immediately been delivered and gives even more significance to the upcoming games against India. She hinted post-series that all four of Ecclestone, Smith, Glenn and Dean could go to the World Cup. This video can not be played Glasgow caught by Davidson-Richards at mid-off Fielding has been one of England's biggest areas for improvement, with six drops seeing them prematurely knocked out in T20 World Cup group stage and seven on day one of the Ashes Test alone. They took 38 catches in this series but still dropped 13 chances, giving them a 75% catch efficiency. That is up from the 41% at the T20 World Cup in October and 63% in the Ashes, and on par with the 73% in home matches since 2020. Their body language and demeanour was also criticised, with Lewis' carefree approach lending itself to accusations of players not caring enough about the results. Under their new leadership, England do seem re-energised with a buzz in the field and the new or returning faces like Smith and Issy Wong, who played two of the T20s, contributing to that change in energy. Edwards said training \"had been great to be at\". But considering the difference in circumstances - England were losing heavily in Australia and winning by barely breaking a sweat against West Indies - we are still no clearer on whether that will change under pressure. \"We're under no illusions that we're going to have tougher times ahead,\" Edwards acknowledged. \"But equally I think what we're seeing already is that appetite for wanting to keep getting better, because they've got to, they know they can't stand still, there's probably someone in county cricket scoring runs who's winning games of cricket. \"It's going to be difficult picking teams going forward, but that's the place we wanted to be, we didn't want to be picking for 15 or 16 players, we wanted to be picking from a pool of 25 players which I genuinely think we are now.\" Only Matthews has put England's bowlers to the sword, but even on those occasions it never felt like they were in danger of losing. The heat and humidity of India's World Cup is where this will really be put to the test. Every game will matter and England will be well aware of the attention that will be on them to put things right after the Ashes.

    "title": "'It doesn't get any bigger' - Sinner & Alcaraz set for French Open showdown",
    "article_text": "Carlos Alcaraz has won seven of his 11 matches against Jannik Sinner - and each of the past four French Open 2025 - men's singles final Date:Sunday, 8 JuneTime:14:00 BSTVenue:Roland Garros Coverage:Live radio commentary across 5 Live Sport and BBC Sounds, plus live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app The latest chapter in the burgeoning rivalry between the two brightest talents in men's tennis will play out on one of the sport's grandest stages for the first time in Sunday's French Open final. World number one Jannik Sinner and defending champion Carlos Alcaraz meet in a tantalising Paris showpiece, having already captured seven major titles between them. The first Grand Slam final to feature two players born in 2000s heralds the beginning of a new era in the men's game - but only one can leave Paris with their perfect record in major finals intact. \"It doesn't get any bigger now. It's a special moment for me and for Carlos,\" said Italy's Sinner. \"The tension you feel before the match and during the match is a little bit different in a way, because we are both very young, we are both different, but talented.\" Gauff beats Sabalenka to win French Open title 'Worst final I ever played' - Sabalenka on Paris loss Tears of pain to tears of joy - Gauff's journey to glory This will be the first French Open men's final between two players aged 23 or under in more than three decades. Spanish 22-year-old Alcaraz has already amassed four Grand Slams - including beating Alexander Zverev in five sets to win last year's Roland Garros final. All three Grand Slam triumphs for Sinner, 23, have come on hard courts - and he is seeking to become only the sixth man in the Open era to win three consecutive majors. It is the first time Alcaraz and Sinner have faced off in a major final - but it is unlikely to be the last. In addition to lifting the Coupe des Mousquetaires, Sunday's champion will pocket 2.55m euros (Â£2.15m) in prize money and gain 2,000 ranking points Whatever the outcome on Sunday, Alcaraz and Sinner will have carved up the past six majors between them as they assert themselves in the post 'Big Three' era. Speaking after his semi-final loss to Sinner, the 38-year-old Novak Djokovic said of the pair: \"They're definitely great for tennis, both of them. \"I think their rivalry is something that our sport needs, no doubt. \"The way they are playing and approaching tennis life, I think they are going to have very successful careers in the next years. \"I'm sure that we're going to see them lifting the big trophies quite often.\" Following his US Open and Australian Open triumphs, Sinner goes into the French Open final on a 20-match winning streak at the majors. The youngest man to reach three consecutive Grand Slam singles finals since Pete Sampras in 1994, his unshakeable consistency combined with devastating precision means he is yet to drop a set in Paris this year. But Alcaraz has proved to be Sinner's kryptonite of late. Jannik Sinner could increase his lead over Carlos Alcaraz in the world rankings to 3,430 points, or have it reduced to 2,030 points Since the start of his title-winning run at the China Open in September 2023, Sinner - who served a three-month doping suspension between February and May - has lost just nine of the 120 matches he has contested. But four of those defeats have come in his past four meetings with Alcaraz, including in straight sets in the Italian Open final on clay last month. Asked if he enjoys the challenge of facing Alcaraz, whom he trails 7-4 in the overall head-to-head, Sinner joked: \"It's fun and not fun. \"I think we try to push ourselves in the best possible way. \"I believe when there is a good match, it's also good to play [it]. It's very special.\" Following in the footsteps of Rafael Nadal as the second Spaniard to reach five major men's singles finals, Alcaraz could emulate his childhood hero by winning his fifth major at the exact same age: 22 years, one month and three days. The two-time Wimbledon champion has taken just 82 matches to reach 70 wins at slams - quicker than all but Bjorn Borg and John McEnroe, who took 81. He improved his record on clay this season to 21 wins in 22 matches - including title wins in Monte Carlo and Rome - after Lorenzo Musetti retired with injury when trailing in their semi-final. \"Most of the time it is just about suffering,\" Alcaraz said when asked what it would take to beat either Sinner or Djokovic after winning Friday's first semi-final. \"But my favourite thing is that it gives me the feedback of how I can be a better player. \"I think that's important, and that's beautiful. Even if I win or not, it gives you a lot of stats and feedback.\" On Sinner, he added: \"He's the best tennis player right now. I mean, he's destroying every opponent.\" Live scores, results and order of play Get tennis news sent straight to your phone",

    "title": "Tears of pain to tears of joy - Gauff's journey to glory",
    "article_text": "Coco Gauff is the first American to win the French Open singles title since the great Serena Williams in 2015 French Open 2025 Dates:25 May-8 JuneVenue:Roland Garros Coverage:Live radio commentaries across 5 Live Sport and BBC Sounds, plus live text commentaries on the BBC Sport website and app Three years ago, the image of a distraught Coco Gauff crying under a towel was one of the rawest moments from a one-sided French Open women's final. Still a teenager, Gauff cut a lonely figure as she sobbed on her chair in the aftermath of a brutal straight-set defeat by Poland's Iga Swiatek. Gauff vowed to come back stronger - and she has. Winning the maiden Grand Slam trophy of her career at the 2023 US Open to fulfil her prodigious talent was the first step. And in Paris, the American world number two demonstrated her gritty mindset once again, fighting back from a set down to beat world number one Aryna Sabalenka andclaim the Roland Garros title. Reflecting on her 2022 defeat, Gauff, 21, said: \"It was a tough time. \"I was doubting myself, wondering if I would ever be able to circumnavigate it, especially my mentality going into that match. \"I was crying before that final and I was so nervous. I was like, if I can't handle this, how am I going to handle it again? \"I just felt really ready today.\" Gauff beats Sabalenka to win French Open title 'Worst final I ever played' - Sabalenka on Paris loss Klugman misses out on rare British juniors win Gauff is one of the few players who truly transcends the sport. Film director Spike Lee flew over from New York to sit courtside for the final, while Gauff namechecked rapper Tyler, The Creator and Olympic sprinter Gabby Thomas for inspiring her to victory. Moments after she beat Sabalenka, Gauff pulled a scrap of paper from her bag. On it, she had written 'I will win the 2025 French Open' as many times as she could fit on a page in her notebook. The inspiration came from Thomas, who did a similar manifestation beforeher 200m triumph at last year's Paris Olympics. Gauff said a video of Thomas talking about the process reappeared on her TikTok the night before the final. \"It came on my 'For You' page again and I felt it was meant to be,\" added Gauff. \"I wrote it last night and was looking at myself in the mirror, trying to instil it in my brain, so I had that belief. \"I didn't know if it would work or not - but it did.\" There was a time when serious questions were being asked Gauff's mentality. With her second serve liable to cough up double faults, and her forehand identified as a weakness, there were debates whether the issues were down to her mentality or technical deficiencies. Some self-doubt appeared as recently as March, with her coach Jean-Christophe Faurel saying the pair \"laid it down on the line\" after a last-16 exit at the Miami Open. Since then, she has won 18 of 21 matches and reached three successive finals in Madrid, Rome and Roland Garros. \"In Madrid and Rome, she lost the first set in her opening match. She could have gone out early and people would have said again, 'Coco can't win a match',\" Faureltold the French Open website.,external \"One of her greatest strengths is her mentality. She never gives up. \"She often makes the difference thanks to her strength of character.\" This ability was evident during Saturday's final in Paris. Playing in a testing wind, and trailing the dominant player on the WTA Tour, Gauff refused to buckle. She fought back from 4-1 down to leave the first set hanging in the balance, then improved further in the next two sets as Sabalenka became increasingly frustrated. \"Mentally there is nobody stronger in the women's game,\" British former world number four Greg Rusedski, who was analysing the match for BBC Radio 5 Live, said. \"Her forehand wasn't firing at times and she looked like she was going to get blown away in the opening set, but she found a way to get through it.\" Coco Gauff's tears of sadness in the 2022 French Open final (left) were replaced by tears of joy on Saturday (right) When Gauff first arrived as a 15-year-old phenomenon at Wimbledon in 2019, she played with complete freedom. Like all young players, difficulties followed as she embarked on a full-time professional career. Gauff's run to the US Open title was helped by her team telling her totrust the raw materials she had. But the maiden Grand Slam singles title did not open the floodgates. Spanish coach Pere Riba left Gauff's team shortly after her New York triumph, while Brad Gilbert - a towering character who led Andre Agassi to six major titles - departed at the end of last season. That led to the return of Faurel, a Frenchman who coached her before her Wimbledon breakthrough. Gauff did not go beyond a quarter-final in the first four months of this season, leading to a heart-to-heart with Faurel after Miami. \"We had to change something up,\" said Gauff. The pair talked about how she needed to improve her serve and play more aggressively when she could. When Gauff has made more than 60% of her first serves against Sabalenka, she has won - and she landed 63% in what was her fifth career victory over her. \"She lost her way a bit,\" Faurel added. \"She's not a machine. It's also partly our fault - there were moments when we probably didn't do the right things. \"Now everything is clear in her mind, and that's why she's winning a lot of matches.\" Live scores, results and order of play Get tennis news sent straight to your phone",

    "article_text": "This video can not be played Watch: NI 'showed character' in Denmark defeat - O'Neill Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill was proud of the character shown by his players in Saturday's 2-1 friendly defeat in Denmark. Northern Ireland made the perfect start when Shea Charles' effort touched off Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and into the net in the sixth minute. However, Denmark rallied and their pressure was rewarded when the impressive Gustav Isaksen curled home on the stroke of half-time. The hosts carried that momentum after the restart and took the lead in the 67th minutethrough Christian Eriksen's close-range finish. Substitute Mika Biereth swiftly had a goal ruled out for offside, but O'Neill was pleased with how his young squad soaked up pressure and stayed in the game until the final whistle. \"We showed a lot of character, we stayed in the game at 2-1 which isn't easy,\" he told BBC Sport NI. \"You have to get to that final phase of the game when you can get an opportunity.\" Eriksen nets winner as Denmark beat Northern Ireland Exposing players to 'higher level' key for NI Two paths, one dream - how duo reached Premier League The friendly in Copenhagen, and Iceland's visit to Windsor Park on Tuesday are the final two qualifiers before Northern Ireland begin their World Cup qualifying campaign in September. They start their bid in Luxembourg and Germany, and also face Slovakia in Group A. O'Neill said his side \"got off to a good start\" in Denmark and defended well, but struggled to keep hold of possession and that pressure only intensified in the second half as Denmark dominated the ball. \"It's a very young team against an experienced team,\" O'Neill added, as his 26-strong squad only contained one player over the age of 30 in the form of substitute George Saville. \"Physically it was tough at times for us but overall we got what we wanted out of the game. \"The most important thing, as I said before this, is the players come away realising we're going to have to play games of this nature in Slovakia, Luxembourg and Germany as well.\"",

    "article_text": "Adam Radwan's first-half double took his Premiership try tally to 12 this season Gallagher Premiership play-off semi-final, Mattioli Woods Welford Road, Leicester Leicester(13) 21 Tries:Radwan 2, PeresePens:Pollard 2 Sale (3) 16 Tries:Du PreezCons:FordPens:Ford 3 Leicester Tigers reached the Premiership final for the second time in four seasons as they edged Sale Sharks 21-16 in a pulsating play-off semi-final. Handre Pollard and George Ford traded penalties before Adam Radwan's double - including a sensational diving finish - put the dominant hosts 13-3 up at the break. Pollard quickly matched Ford's second penalty, but a Rob du Preez score from a slick move and another three points from Ford brought the Sharks level to tee up a grand finale. Izaia Perese's scorching run to the line with his first touch restored the Tigers' lead with 13 minutes remaining and Michael Cheika's men survived intense late pressure to preserve their unbeaten home play-off record. Leicester will now chase a record-extending 12th league title at Twickenham next Saturday when they take on six-time champions Bath in the final. The result ensured the departing head coach Cheika, skipper Julian Montoya and fly-half Handre Pollard, as well as retiring former England trio Dan Cole, Ben Youngs and Mike Brown, will get the chance to see out their Tigers careers with a title. Rob du Preez went over for Sale's only try shortly before the hour mark In a high-energy, intensely physical start, played out in a raucous atmosphere, Pollard's pinpoint penalty from the left touchline put the hosts ahead after Sharks infringed at the line-out. Amid a fierce battle for supremacy up front, former Tigers fly-half Ford levelled following a hard-won scrum penalty, but that was as good as it got for Sale before half-time. Radwan struck with virtually his first touch of the ball when Jack van Poortvliet's switch of play and long pass gave the winger space to run into down the right flank before his dart back inside to the line took out three defenders. However, the former Newcastle wing's second finish was sensational. Ollie Hassell-Collins and Ollie Chessum were both stopped just short before Radwan at full-stretch somehow gathered Pollard's overhit crossfield kick in mid-air as he dived for the line. The Tigers smothered the Sharks and wrestled control of the set-piece, but a huge defensive effort from Sale at least denied Leicester another try in first-half stoppage-time and limited the damage. Arron Reed's explosive burst and Raffi Quirke's line break shortly after the restart signalled intent and Sale's threat, the latter earning Ford a simple penalty for 13-6. Pollard sliced a makeable penalty wide - his third successive miss - but took another chance moments later. Izaia Perese provided the match-winning score within a minute of coming off the bench Yet having been on the ropes for so long, the Sharks hit back with virtually their first visit to the Leicester line when a spell of pressure ended with Ford feeding du Preez's run under the posts. The crowd were on their feet to welcome long-time servants Cole and Youngs on to home turf one last time, but the momentum and energy seemed to be all with the visitors who levelled through Ford's third penalty with 15 minutes left. Yet it was another Tigers replacement, Perese, who stole the show almost instantly, hitting the line at full tilt just inside the Sale half and scorching away on a diagonal run to the left corner. Chessum went close to sealing the match after Freddie Steward's try-saving tackle on Du Preez and Emeka Ilione had made a crucial turnover in front of his own posts. And in a frantic finale, the Tigers had to summon up one last huge defensive push in front of their own line to withstand a late, late Sale surge and ensure it would be them who made it to Twickenham next weekend. Leicester Tigers head coach Michael Cheika told BBC Radio Leicester: \"It was tough. First half I thought we were excellent, and second half I thought Sale upped their game. \"We didn't go backwards or drop our game but maybe we didn't have enough impact forward to keep them away. \"I always knew it would be a game that would go right down to the wire. Once you're ready for a game like that and think about it mentally then when it comes you're okay with it and I think we handled that pretty well. \"We need to go up a level that's for sure, so it will be on us as coaches to give the lads some tips on how they can get up that extra level.\" Sale director of rugby Alex Sanderson told BBC Radio Manchester: \"It's crushing. The season crashes to a very abrupt end in the semi-finals when you're hoping and have planned for something more. \"I don't think we deserved to get to a final on that performance. \"I thought how they (Leicester) played in terms of their game plan and how they executed it - aerial contests and scrums on what was a slippy pitch, I thought they played that game very well and deserved to win by a few more if I'm honest. \"We came right back into it, scored a try and those moments when you've just scored are the ones when you can't take a collective breath. \"So to concede so quickly after scoring opens the door for them again and after that it was always a difficult task on that kind of day with the form they were in.\" Leicester:Steward, Radwan, Kata, Woodward, Hassell-Collins, Pollard, Van Poortvliet; Smith, Montoya, Hayes, Henderson, Chessum, Liebenberg, Reffell, Cracknell.

    "title": "Kenya tells tea factories to cut ties with Rainforest Alliance due to costs",
    "article_text": "The Kenyan government has told its tea factories to stop working with theRainforest Alliancebecause it says the costs involved in securing the ethical label don’t add up for farmers. The non-profit organisation is one of the world’s most recognisable certification schemes with its green frog seal on food packaging a sign consumers “can feel confident that these products support a better world”. However the world’s third largest tea producer has ordered tea factories to suspend certification work because the cost is adding to the financial strain on struggling smallholders. A recent Fairtrade Foundation poll found only one in five tea workers and farmers inKenyaare earning enough each month to support their families with essentials. In a memo issued after an industry summit, the agriculture principal secretary, Paul Ronoh, said the “burden of implementation” of the Rainforest Alliance scheme was vested on tea factories then “cascaded to the tea farmers and growers”. This cost “ordinarily should be met by the customers”, Ronoh said. Rainforest Alliance is a global non-profit organisation that works to promote sustainable agriculture, forestry and responsible business practices. The green frog seal appears on nearly 240 brands and is almost ubiquitous in UK supermarket tea ranges with big names including Tetley, PG Tips and YorkshireTeaamong those signed up. About half the tea consumed in the UK comes from Kenya. The widespread demand for ethical certification is linked to the reputational risk of sourcing from tea-producing regions with a long list of problems. These include low wages, unsafe working conditions, gender inequality and environmentally unsustainable practices. In addition, countries such as India andKenyaare grappling with climate crisis-related weather changes. However critics complain that while buyers for western markets only want to buy certified tea they rarely offer to pay a premium for it. While UK consumers are happy to splurge on coffee, the same is not true of tea. The average price of a teabag is “just 2 or 3p” despite the fact that the cost to grow and pick tea is increasing, according to a recent Fairtrade Foundation report on the subject. Although Rainforest Alliance facilitates certification, it does not set the fees charged by external auditors who evaluate whether growers meet its “sustainable agriculture standard”. The cost of certification depends on factors such as farm size, with growers often grouping together. For a smallholder-managed tea factory the annual cost is estimated to be about $3,000. This could come down however as a streamlined process that cuts the preparation work involved in an audit is being introduced this year. Ronoh said that as the Rainforest Alliance logo “had not demonstrated solid impact commensurate to the costs of implementation, the meeting resolved to suspend the scheme with immediate effect”. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Tea is a major cash crop for Kenya and the decision comes as the country grapples with the knock-on effect of a moribund tea price on the millions of people who rely on it for their livelihood. The Rainforest Alliance says it is engaging with the State Department of Agriculture in Kenya to “gain clarity and to work towards a joint resolution quickly”. It has contacted certificate-holders to assure them that the endorsement remains valid until the expiration date, meaning “farmers are able to sell their tea as certified”. A spokesperson said: “We remain committed to supporting in Kenya to the fullest extent possible, and our tea brands and companies have communicated that they remain fully committed to continuing to purchase Rainforest Alliance certified tea.” The Kenyan government is said to be considering putting in place a localised certification model. It would likely have similar sustainability goals but lower compliance costs and less administrative complexity. A spokesperson for the Ethical Tea Partnership (ETP), an NGO focused on tackling problems in the tea sector, said it hoped the Kenyan suspension would be “short-lived and that a solution to this current impasse will be found”. Certification is a “critical tool to allow all stakeholders in the tea supply chain to ensure that the workers, farmers and communities who rely on tea for their livelihoods are being treated fairly”, the ETP added.",

    "title": "Scott Morrison sought advice to obstruct Nauru asylum seekers from accessing abortions, documents reveal",
    "article_text": "Scott Morrison overrode medical advice in the case of an asylum seeker in offshore detention trying to access an abortion, and had previously sought advice that would effectively prevent access to terminations entirely, ministerial advicereveals. Documents released under freedom of information laws show Morrison, in 2014 as immigration minister, had sought advice to deny the transfer of women to a hospital on the Australian mainland to access termination services before 20 weeks’ gestation. Abortion is illegal on Nauru, except to save the mother’s life, and carries a prison term of up to 14 years. Termination laws differ across Australian states, but if pregnant women in offshore detention were prohibited from accessing abortion services in Australia until after 20 weeks, it would be far more difficult to access those services at all. A handwritten note by Morrison, on a document dated June 2014, stated: “I would also like advice on denying transfer pre 20 weeks for pregnant women.” In the same document, Morrison specified that women should only be transferred to Brisbane, not South Australia, the Northern Territory or Victoria for abortion services. Morrison did not respond to requests for comment, and Guardian Australia cannot confirm what advice he received. In the case of a woman, who was not identified in the redacted documents, medical advice recommended she be transferred to Victoria for an abortion, over Brisbane where she would have had to have waited a week for a hospital ethics panel to consider her case. That policy was in place in Queensland for women seeking a termination after 20 weeks’ gestation. In Victoria, a woman could seek a termination without approval of a hospital ethics board until 24 weeks. Guardian Australia understands the woman was taken to Brisbane, rather than Melbourne, where the panel deliberated on her case. One senior source, who spoke to Guardian Australia on the condition of anonymity, said Morrison did not specifically target abortion access. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email David Manne, a prominent refugee advocate and lawyer, said in his view the broader immigration policy at the time was part of an “extreme deterrence agenda”. “Inherent in the [broader] policy was conscious, calculated cruelty,” he said. “Clearly, [the policy] was far more than reckless indifference, it was deliberate. “[It was] part of a system that was underpinned by the extreme deterrence agenda … the basic rights and dignity of people subject to the policy were essentially irrelevant.” Jana Favero, the deputy CEO of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre (ASRC), who was an advocate for the centre at the time, said the documents were “outrageous” and “consistent” with the ASRC’s experience trying to help asylum seekers get medical transfers. “It was extremely challenging and difficult for the medical transfer from people offshore, in particular women who were pregnant,” she said. Manne claimed the Abbott government was concerned asylum seekers and refugees were using medical transfers as a back door to get into Australia. Once in Australia, and in the Australian onshore detention system, an asylum seeker could go to the court to seek an injunction to prevent being sent back to offshore detention. “[They] could plead their case under law to resist being sent back toNauru, to further dangers of the kinds that they’d already faced,” Manne said. This wasn’t the only concern held by the government. Manne said the policy was based on deterrence, to stop others seeking asylumarriving by boat. “If we make some exception, if there’s a perceived crack of light in this policy, this could see the resumption of boat arrivals, that was clearly the thinking.” Later, in 2019, Peter Dutton, by then the home affairs minister in the Morrison government,accused women in Nauru refugee centresof using rape and abortion claims as a ploy to get to Australia. Over the 18 months from 1 January 2013 to 20 June 2014,IHMS, the government contracted healthcare provider for Nauru, said there were six pregnant transferees who were taken to the mainland for a termination. In June 2014, there were 289 women in detention on Nauru, according to data collated by the Refugee Council of Australia. Numerousinternal and external reviewsof offshore detention centres found instances of violence and traumatic living conditions, amid allegations and reports of rape, sexual assaults. An independent investigation, by the former integrity commissioner Philip Moss, commissioned by Morrison in October 2014, found evidence of rapes and sexual violence on Nauru and Manus Island, and said incidents were often under-reported. In 2016, Guardian Australia released theNauru files, a collection of 2,000 leaked incident reports detailing harrowing instances of abuse on the island between May 2013 and October 2015. More than half of the reports (51.3%) involved children, even though children made up only about 18% of those in detention on Nauru during the time covered by the reports. Favero said the ASRC had performed its own audit on medical transfers at the time, and said it sometimes took up to 18 months for an asylum seeker to get help on the mainland. “From the point where there was a [doctor’s] recommendation for a medical transfer, sometimes it took up to 12 to 18 months for that to happen, and it only happened as a result of a huge amount of pressure including legal action,” Favero said. In February 2019, five years later, after Morrison became prime minister, Labor and the crossbenchpassed the medevac bill, against the Coalition government, that established a medical panel to oversee medical transfers of people from offshore detention. That law lasted less than 10 months, before it wasrepealedby the Morrison government in December that year. “The decision [to transfer a patient] should have been in doctors’ hands not in bureaucrats and politicians hands which is what that legislation was,” Favero said.",

    "article_text": "The Israeli military has retrieved the body of a Thai hostage, Nattapong Pinta, who had been held in Gaza since Hamas’s attack on 7 October 2023, according to defence minister,IsraelKatz. . Pinta’s body was held by a Palestinian militant group called the Mujahideen Brigades, and was retrieved from the area of Rafah in southern Gaza, Katz said.His family in Thailandhas been notified. Pinta, an agricultural worker, was abducted from the Nir Oz kibbutz, a small community near the border, where one in four people were killed or taken hostage during the Hamas-led 2023 attack. The Israeli military said Pinta had been abducted alive and killed by his captors, who had also killed and taken toGazathe bodies of two more Israeli-American hostages that were retrieved this week. There was no immediate comment from the militant group. Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people in Israel in the 2023 attack, Israel’s deadliest day, and took 251 hostages, 55 of whom remain in Gaza. Twenty hostages are believed to still be alive, according to Israeli authorities. Israel responded to the Hamas attacks with a military campaign that has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities in the Hamas-run strip, and left much of the enclave in ruins, with a population of more than 2 million people largely displaced.",

    "title": "Iran blasts Trump for ‘racist mentality’ and hostility to Muslims over travel ban",
    "article_text": "Tehran has denounced theUS travel banon Iranians and citizens of 11 other mostly Middle Eastern and African countries, saying Washington’s decision was a sign of a “racist mentality”. Donald Trumpsigned an executive order on Wednesday reviving sweeping restrictions that echo the US president’s first-term travel ban, justified on national security grounds after a firebomb attack at a pro-Israel rally in Colorado. Alireza Hashemi-Raja, the foreign ministry’s director general for the affairs of Iranians abroad, called the measure – which takes effect on 9 June – “a clear sign of the dominance of a supremacist and racist mentality among American policymakers”. The decision “indicates the deep hostility of American decision-makers towards the Iranian and Muslim people”, he added in a statement the ministry released on Saturday. Apart from Iran, the US ban targets nationals of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. A partial ban was imposed on travellers from seven other countries. Hashemi-Raja said the policy “violates fundamental principles of international law” and deprives “hundreds of millions of people of the right to travel based solely on their nationality or religion”. The foreign ministry official said the ban was discriminatory and would “entail international responsibility for the US government”, without elaborating. Iran and the US severed diplomatic ties shortly after the 1979Islamic Revolution, and relations have remained deeply strained since. The US is home to the largest Iranian community outside Iran. According to figures from Tehran’s foreign ministry, in 2020 there were about 1.5 million Iranians in the US. Trump’s executive order came days after Sunday’sattack at the Colorado rally, in which authorities said more than a dozen people were hurt. The suspect is an Egyptian man who had overstayed a tourist visa.",

    "title": "Kabul at risk of becoming first modern city to run out of water, report warns",
    "article_text": "Kabul could become the first modern city to completely run out of water, experts have warned. Water levels within Kabul’s aquifers have dropped by up to 30 metres over the past decade owing to rapid urbanisation and climate breakdown, according toa report by the NGO Mercy Corps. Meanwhile, almost half of the city’s boreholes – the primary source of drinking water for Kabul residents – have dried out.Waterextraction currently exceeds the natural recharge rate by 44m cubic metres each year. If these trends continue, all of Kabul’s aquifers will run dry as early as 2030, posing an existential threat to the city’s seven million inhabitants. “There should be a committed effort to document this better and to draw international attention to the need to address the crisis,” said Mercy CorpsAfghanistancountry director, Dayne Curry. “No water means people leave their communities, so for the international community to not address the water needs of Afghanistan will only result in more migration and more hardship for the Afghan people.” The report also highlights water contamination as another widespread challenge. Up to80% of Kabul’s groundwater is deemed unsafe, with high levels of sewage, salinity and arsenic. Water access has become a daily battle for people in Kabul. Some households spend up to 30% of their income on water, and more than two-thirds have incurred water-related debt. “Afghanistan is facing a lot of problems, but this water scarcity is one of the hardest,” said Nazifa, a teacher living in the Khair Khana neighbourhood of Kabul. “Every household is facing difficulty, especially those with low income. Adequate, good quality well water just doesn’t exist.” Someprivate companies are capitalising on the crisisby actively digging new wells and extracting large amounts of public groundwater, then selling it back to city’s residents at inflated prices. “We used to pay 500 afghanis (£5.30) every 10 days to fill our cans from the water tankers. Now, that same amount of water costs us 1,000 afghanis,” said Nazifa. “The situation has been getting worse over the past two weeks. We are afraid it will get even more expensive.” Kabul’s sevenfold growth from less than 1 million people in 2001 has drastically transformed water demands. A lack of centralised governance and regulation has also perpetuated the problem over the decades. In early 2025, the UN’s office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs announced that itspartners had received just $8.4m(£6.2m) of the $264m required to implement planned water and sanitation programming in Afghanistan. A further $3bn in international water and sanitation funding has been frozen since the Taliban’s return to power in August 2021. The US’s recent move tocut more than 80% of its USAID fundinghas compounded the crisis. “Everything is so aid-dependent,” said Curry. “We can throw millions of dollars at short-term water fixes and say we’ve addressed the need, but that need will continue until there’s better investment for longer-term solutions. And that’s where foreign governments are stopping short at this point due to political dynamics.” Nazifa said: “Water is a human right and natural resource of Afghanistan. It is not a political issue. My heart bleeds when I look at the flowers and fruit trees in the garden, all drying up. But what can we do? We are currently living in a military state, so we can’t exactly go to the government to report the issue.” The Panjshir River pipeline is one project which, if completed, could alleviate the city’s over-reliance on groundwater and supply 2 million residents with potable water. The design phases for this were completed in late 2024 and are awaiting budget approval, with the government seeking additional investors to supplement the $170m cost. “We don’t have time to sit around waiting for budgets. We are caught in a storm from which there will be no return if we don’t act immediately,” said Dr Najibullah Sadid, a senior researcher on water resource management and member of theAfghan Water and Environment Professionals Network. “Those in Kabul are in a situation where they have to decide between food or water. And yet, the locals we’ve spoken to are still willing to invest what little they have towards a sustainable solution. Whichever project will bring the most immediate impact is the priority. We just need to start somewhere.”",

    "article_text": "New drug treatments, longer-lasting batteries and developing artificial intelligence are among research projects that will receive funding as part of an £86bn government investment into science and technology. Ministers have announced a £22.5bn a year commitment inresearch and development(R&D) over the next four years, including up to £500m for regional authorities to target the investment locally. The announcement comes before the spending review on Wednesday whereRachel Reeves, the chancellor, will set out day-to-day expenditure for three years and investment spending for four years. Reeves said: “Britain is the home of science and technology. Through the plan for change”, we are investing in Britain’s renewal to create jobs, protect our security against foreign threats and make working families better off.” Peter Kyle, the science and technology secretary, said: “R&D is the very foundation of the breakthroughs that make our lives easier and healthier – from new medicines enabling us to live longer, more fulfilled lives to developments in AI giving us time back, from easing our train journeys through to creating the technology we need to protect our planet from climate change.” Ministers said the investment would boost the life sciences industry in Liverpool, the defence sector in Northern Ireland and semiconductors in south Wales. It matches a commitment made by the previous Conservative government to spend £22bn a year on R&D. The seven mayoral strategic authorities in England – Greater Manchester, West Midlands, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Liverpool City Region, North East and Greater London – will each receive awards of at least £30m each. The fund will also include a competition open to all other parts of the UK. The announcement was welcomed by Richard Parker, the mayor of the West Midlands, and Kim McGuinness, the north-east mayor. McGuinness said the funds would support the car and green energy industries in her region. The package also includes £4.8m for a partnership between Manchester and Cambridge to attract business investment. Alongside the spending review on Wednesday, Reeves is planning to announcean overhaul of the Treasury’s “green book”– the rules that govern how public investment plans are judged. Critics say the existing rules are biased in favour of London and the south-east. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Changing the rules will allow ministers to divert more money to areas of the north and Midlands, including the so-called red wall where Labour MPs face an electoral challenge from Reform UK. The chancellor will put£113bn of new capital investmentin homes, transport and energy at the forefront of the spending review, money which was unlocked by changes she made to the government’s debt rules in October.

    "article_text": "The EastEnders actor Jamie Borthwick has been suspended by the BBC after using an ableist slur on the set ofStrictly Come Dancing. A video emerged of the actor, who plays Jay Brown on the long-running soap, using the term to describe the people of Blackpool, the town where the programme was being filmed, according to the Sun on Sunday. On Saturday, a spokesperson for theBBCsaid: “This language is entirely unacceptable and in no way reflects the values or standards we hold and expect at the BBC. We have robust processes in place for this.” Warren Kirwan, media manager at disability equality charity Scope, said: “Attitudes and language like this are never acceptable. “It’s not just ignorant and hurtful to disabled people, it has wider consequences. Negative attitudes hold disabled people back in all areas of life, from getting a job to shopping on the high street. “Mr Borthwick needs to reflect on what he said, educate himself and do better. We hope he takes the opportunity to get to know the reality of disabled people’s lives. Borthwick won the Strictly 2023 Christmas special with Nancy Xu. The 30-year-old took part in the most recent series of Strictly, where he was paired with the professional dancer Michelle Tsiakkas. They were eliminated in week 10, finishing seventh. Borthwick, who joinedEastEndersin 2006 and is one of the longest-serving actors on the show, told the Sun on Sunday: “I want to apologise sincerely and wholeheartedly for the words I used in the video showing my reaction to making it through Blackpool week on Strictly. I am deeply sorry for any offence and upset my words and actions have caused. “It is no excuse, but I did not fully understand the derogatory term I used and its meaning. That is on me completely. Now I am aware, I am deeply embarrassed to have used the term and directed it in the way I did. It was wrong. “When I made the video, I was excited and caught up in the moment. Again, that is no excuse. But my regrettable actions are not a true reflection of my views, or who I am. “I enjoyed every minute of my time in the Blackpool Tower Ballroom and the town itself. The people of Blackpool have always been amazing with the Strictly crew, dancers and cast members. I know they will be again for this year’s show and those in years to come. I am truly sorry.” Wynne Evans, who also competed in last year’s edition of Strictly, said last week he had been dropped by the BBC, after apologising for using “inappropriate language” during the launch of the Strictly Come Dancing tour. The Welsh opera singer, 53, will no longer be a BBC Radio Wales presenter, he announced last week. Earlier this year, he apologised for language that he called “inappropriate and unacceptable” after the Mail on Sunday reported that he was heard making a remark to a woman in a video filmed during the Strictly launch event. It is understood Evans was given a warning over the remark by tour producers. In January, he said: “I’ve agreed with the BBC that I’ll take some time out from my radio show and the Strictly Live tour, as well as my other public commitments, to prioritise my wellbeing. I am deeply sorry for the pain my inappropriate actions have caused, and plan to take this time for self-reflection.”",

    "article_text": "Vegetable likenesses of Donald Trump and Dolly Parton and a papal “Cornclave” went on display on Saturday at the Lambeth country show, an urban take on a country fair held annually in London’s Brockwell Park. The two-day show features sheep-shearing, livestock competitions, food, music and a vegetable sculpture contest that has attracted national renown for its quirky creativity. This year, several sculptures referenced the recent papal election or movie on the same subject, including one featuring cardinals made of maize, titled Cornclave. Other entries included Irish rap trio Kneecap in potato form, “Cauli Parton” in a movie-inspired tableau titled 9 to Chive, a vegetable “Mo Salad” likeness of Liverpool soccer star Mohamed Salah, and animated icons Wallace and Gromit made from butternut squash. Trump also got the butternut squash treatment, while some entries referred to local politics. In Lambeth, as in other parts of London, local authorities have turned to holding large concerts and festivals in parks as a way to raise money, to the chagrin of some neighbors. Wolf Hall actor Mark Rylance, one of a group of local residents opposed to big events in Brockwell Park, is represented as “Mark Rylunch”, with an apple-carved head and satirical signs branding him a Nimby (“not in my backyard”) campaigner. “Every year, this is what we get so excited about, is the vegetable sculptures,” country show regular Maddy Luxon said. “It’s just so unique and just so witty and we love the political ones.” “And the puns,” said Marek Szandrowski, who was with her. “The vegetable puns, definitely.”",

    "article_text": "Multiple women have accusedJared Letoof impropriety, with some calling the 53-year-old actor and musician’s behavior “predatory, terrifying and unacceptable”. In a newreportby Air Mail on Saturday, nine women have come forward to accuse Leto of engaging in inappropriate behavior over the years, including flirting with teenagers. Speaking to the outlet, one woman said that back in 2006, when she was 16 years old, Leto approached her outside a cafe in Los Angeles. According to the woman, Leto, who was seated with the actor Ashley Olsen, who was then 19, grabbed her arm. “I looked down and it wasJared Leto,” the woman told Air Mail, adding: “We had a quick conversation, and he got my number.” She went on to say that Leto called her home a few days later, recalling: “I don’t know if he was on drugs or what … It was the weirdest, grossest voice … [But] for me, it’s Jared, you know?” She said that Leto said he was hosting a party at his house that evening and that he invited her. The woman declined, telling the outlet: “I didn’t even have a driver’s license.” Nevertheless, she said, Leto kept calling her, “always at one, two, three AM”. “And the conversations turned sexual. He’d ask things like: ‘Have you ever had a boyfriend? Have you ever sucked a dick?’” she told Air Mail. Another woman, the model Laura La Rue, recounted a similar experience to the outlet, saying that when she was 16 years old in 2008, she was at an event in a private residence in Beverly Hills where Leto was “watching her so intensely”. “He asked how old I was. I said, ‘I’m 16. How old are you?’” La Rue told Air Mail. Leto, who was 36 at the time, proceeded to ask for her number. The two began an email correspondence, which eventually led to her visiting Leto’s home in April 2009, the outlet reports. “I remember him teasing me the whole time I was there,” La Rue said, adding: “He was flirting with me. He’d lean in close, then pull away, like it was a game.” In a statement to Air Mail, a representative of Leto said: “Their communications contain nothing sexual or inappropriate … and Ms La Rue later applied to work as Mr Leto’s personal assistant, further underscoring the absence of anything inappropriate in any of their interactions.” Air Mail reports La Rue denying ever applying for a personal assistant role with Leto. During a separate visit, La Rue said, Leto walked out of a room completely naked when she was 17 years old. “He just walked out, dick out, like it was normal … I thought maybe this was just what adult men do,” she told Air Mail. Another woman who spoke to the outlet said that she and Leto began a texting relationship while she was still underage. According to her, Leto would ask her inappropriate questions during her visits to his house, such as: “Do any of the little boys you hang out with fuck you?” The woman added that once, when she was 18, Leto “suddenly pulled his penis out and started masturbating”. She told the outlet: “Then he walked over, grabbed my hand, and put it on him. He leaned in and said: ‘I want you to spit on it.’” Another woman, Allie Teilz, a Los Angeles-based DJ and music producer, last month on Instagram reposted a 2012 Facebook status in which she had said: “Youre [sic] not really in L.A. until Jared Leto tries to force himself on you backstage… In a kilt.. And a snow hat,” Air Mail reported. In her Instagram stories, which Air Mail reviewed, Teilz said: “I was assaulted and traumatized by this creep when I was 17 … He knew my age and didn’t care. What he did was predatory, terrifying and unacceptable.” A representative of Leto has “expressly denied” the various women’s accusations reported in Air Mail, including Teilz’s, which the representative said were “demonstrably false”.

    "title": "Trump warns Musk of ‘very serious consequences’ if he backs Democrats",
    "article_text": "Donald TrumpwarnedElon Muskon Saturday that he faces “very serious consequences” if he fundsDemocratic candidatesfollowing the pair’s epic public bust-up this week. The warning, delivered in an interview with NBC News scheduled to broadcast on Sunday, follows days of feuding and threats after Musk called Republicans’ budget legislation an “abomination”. Trump told interviewer Kristen Welker his relationship with the tech mogul was over and warned Musk against choosing to fundDemocratsafter spending close to $300m in support of Trump’s re-election last year. “If he does, he’ll have to pay the consequences for that,” Trump toldNBC News. “He’ll have to pay very serious consequences if he does that,” he added. Trump was also asked whether he had any wish to repair his relationship with Musk. “No,” he said. Asked whether he thought their relationship was over, he said: “I would assume so, yeah,” and said he had no plans to speak with his erstwhile sidekick. “I’m too busy doing other things,” Trump said, adding: “I have no intention of speaking to him.” But he predicted that the spat had helped to unify the Republican party around him, saying the “party has never been united like this before. It’s never been. It’s actually more so than it was three days ago.” Musk’s opposition to the Republican budget bill, formally the “one big beautiful bill act”, would not, he predicted, affect its passage through Congress. The bill narrowly passed the House and is now under consideration in the Senate. However, some conservative Republicans share Musk’s concerns about the need for significant spending cuts and are considering making changes. The bill extends Trump’s 2017 tax cuts and includes new spending for border security and the military. Republicans aimed to offset these costs with cuts to programmes such as Medicaid, food stamps and green-energy tax credits. Projections from the congressional budget office and independent analysts indicate that the bill would add between $2.3tn and $5tn to the deficit over the next 10 years. White House officials contend that the economic growth generated by tax cuts will offset the increased spending. Still, Trump told NBC he is “very confident” that the bill will pass the Senate before 4 July. “I think, actually, Elon brought out the strengths of the bill because people that weren’t as focused started focusing on it, and they see how good it is,” Trump said. “So in that sense, there was a big favor. But I think Elon, really, I think it’s a shame that he’s so depressed and so heartbroken.” He also accused Musk of being “disrespectful to the office of the president”. “I think it’s a very bad thing, because he’s very disrespectful. You could not disrespect the office of the president,” he said. Earlier, Musk deleted a post from X, the social media platform he owns, that asserted links between Trump and disgraced US financier Jeffrey Epstein. Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion Questioned about the inflammatory post, Trump said: “That’s called ‘old news’, that’s been old news, that has been talked about for years. Even Epstein’s lawyer said I had nothing to do with it. It’s old news.” Musk has also retracted a threat to begin “decommissioning” SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft used by Nasa to ferry astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station. The original threat came after Trump suggested he might cancel SpaceX’s federal contracts. On Saturday, the president said he hadn’t given the subject any more thought. “I’d be allowed to do that,” he said, “but I haven’t given it any thought.” Earlier on Saturday, JD Vance told interviewer and comedian Theo Von that Musk was making a “huge mistake” going after Trump, but downplayed Musk’s attacks as being made by an “emotional guy” who got frustrated. “I hope that eventually Elon comes back into the fold. Maybe that’s not possible now because he’s gone so nuclear,” the vice-president said. But he added: “Look, it happens to everybody. I’ve flown off the handle way worse thanElon Muskdid in the last 24 hours.” “I actually think if Elon chilled out a little bit, everything would be fine,” Vance said.

    "title": "California leaders condemn Ice raids in LA: ‘We will not stand for this’",
    "article_text": "The Department of Homeland Security conducted raids on multiple locations acrossLos Angeleson Friday, clashing with the crowds of people who gathered to protest and prompting widespread criticism from California leaders. Masked agents were recorded pulling several people out of two LA-area Home Depot stores and the clothing manufacturer Ambient Apparel’s headquarters in LA’s Fashion District. Immigration advocates said the raids also included four other locations, including a doughnut shop. There has not yet been confirmation of how many people were taken into custody during the coordinated sweeps. At an afternoon press conference, Angelica Salas, executive director for the Coalition of Humane Immigrant Rights, said at least 45 people were arrested without warrants. “Our community is under attack and is being terrorized. These are workers, these are fathers, these are mothers, and this has to stop. Immigration enforcement that is terrorizing our families throughout this country and picking up our people that we love must stop now,” Salas told the crowd. The protest only grew as the afternoon wore on. By 6pm local time, hundreds of people assembled around the federal building in downtown Los Angeles, where those taken into custody during the raids are being held. Earlier in the day, armed agents clad in heavy protective and tactical gear, including some who wore gas masks, could be seen on video and through aerial footage pushing individuals and trying to corral large groups that congregated to challenge the raids. Smoke grenades were reportedly thrown near the crowds and pepper spray was used as the federal officers attempted to clear the area. As the demonstrations continued into the evening,videosshowed officers firing less-lethal weapons toward protestors. Some people in the crowd attempted to block large armored trucks carrying FBI agents as they departed. One person reportedly threw eggs at the vehicles. The Los Angeles fire department was called to the scene to administer aid to protesters injured by agents and officers, which included the president of the California branch of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), David Huerta. The organization said instatementhe was detained and called for his immediate release. Huerta, who was injured and detained, released a statement to the Los Angeles Times from the hospital,saying: “What happened to me is not about me. This is about something much bigger.” “This is about how we as a community stand together and resist the injustice that’s happening. Hard-working people, and members of our family and our community, are being treated like criminals. We all collectively have to object to this madness because this is not justice,” he added. “We call for an end to the cruel, destructive, and indiscriminate Ice raids that are tearing apart our communities, disrupting our economy, and hurting all working people,” Tia Orr, executive director of SEIUCaliforniasaid. “Immigrant workers are essential to our society: feeding our nation, caring for our elders, cleaning our workplaces, and building our homes.” The Los Angeles police department also assisted the federal officers in dispersing demonstrators, despite the department’s insistence that it is not involved in “civil immigration enforcement”, and would only have a presence to ensure public safety. Advocates used megaphones from the streets outside where the raids were occurring to remind workers inside of their rights, the Los Angeles Timesreported. Some called out individual names and demanded they be given access to lawyers. “The community is here with you,” one person shouted. “Your family is here with you.” Los Angeles leaders were quick to condemn the actions, which were part of a string of high-profile raids undertaken by Immigration and Customs Enforcement under orders from Donald Trump. In a statement on Friday, California governor Gavin Newsomsaid: “Continued chaotic federal sweeps, across California, to meet an arbitrary arrest quota are as reckless as they are cruel. Donald Trump’s chaos is eroding trust, tearing families apart, and undermining the workers and industries that power America’s economy.” Newsom alsocondemnedHuerta’s arrest, saying: “David Huerta is a respected leader, a patriot, and an advocate for working people. No one should ever be harmed for witnessing government action.” “I am closely monitoring the Ice raids that are currently happening across Los Angeles, including at a Korean-American owned store in my district,” Congresswoman Sydney Kamlager-Dove said in a post on X, along with instructions on how affected constituents could reach her office for help. “LA has long been a safe haven for immigrants,” she added. “Trump claims he’s targeting criminals, but he’s really just tearing families apart and destabilizing entire communities.” Mayor Karen Bass said in a statement that she was “deeply angered by what has taken place”, and that her office was coordinating with immigrant rights community organizations. “These tactics sow terror in our communities and disrupt basic principles of safety in our city,” she said. “We will not stand for this.” In response, Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, who has functioned as one of the chief architects of the administration’s draconian immigration crackdowns,wrote: “You have no say in this at all. Federal law is supreme and federal law will be enforced.” Los Angeles councilmember Eunisses Hernandez said in a statement: “These actions are escalating: agents arrive without warning and leave quickly, aware that our communities mobilize fast. I urge Angelenos to stay alert.” Meanwhile, the California senator Alex Padilla said: “The Ice raids across Los Angeles today are a continuation of a disturbing pattern of extreme and cruel immigration enforcement operations across the country. These indiscriminate raids prove once again that theTrump administrationcares about nothing but instilling harm and fear in our communities to drive immigrants into the shadows. It will not work.” He added: “This fearmongering is not going to change the fact that immigrants are valued members of our communities who contribute to our society and economy, and my office will demand accountability for today’s actions.” Similarly, the Los Angeles county supervisor Lindsey Horvathcalledthe Ice raids “acts of cruelty and bigotry, targeting our immigrant neighbors and tearing families apart”. Horvath added: “These actions are designed to instill fear in communities of color – but we will not be intimidated, and we will not be silent. I’m in direct communication with county, state, & community leaders to ensure that all available protections from LA County are activated immediately. We must remain vigilant. We must protect one another. And above all, we will stand together.” Maya Yang contributed to this report",

    "article_text": "More than 100 dogs were rescued from an apparent puppy mill inNorth Carolinawhere they were kept in “egregious conditions”, an animal shelter said. The SPCA of Wake county on Wednesday removed 101 dogs from a home that appeared to have been functioning as a puppy mill. In astatementonline, the shelter said that the dogs had been “surrounded by their own waste, packed 5 or 6 to a cage and stacked floor to ceiling, or free roaming in cramped quarters and filth”. The shelter, working alongside Raleigh animal control, also said that there had been numerous mother dogs with very young nursing puppies, adding that 19 of those dogs were now in SPCA Wake’s care. “These events unfolded very quickly. Within an hour of receiving this call for help, we were on the property ready to take as many pets as possible,” the shelter said. Pictures posted online showed puppies of various breeds in cages and with matted fur as they were being cared for by shelter employees.Speaking to CBS 17, SPCA Wake spokesperson Samantha Ranlet said that many of the dogs were toy poodle mixes, pomeranians, chihuahuas, yorkies and other small “doodle” mixes. In a follow-up post on Friday, the shelter said that its medical team had been treating each dog’s individual needs, adding that many of them were suffering from skin and dental issues. “The matted dirty fur is coming off in heaps,” the shelter said. Additional pictures posted online showed clumps of matted fur being trimmed from dogs of varying sizes. “We’re seeing a lot of smiles from these guys. This is the biggest moment in these dogs’ lives, and we are feeling so grateful to be a part of their healing. Thank you to everyone who has donated or reached out in support of these efforts. This rescue is a big undertaking, and we can’t do it without you,” the shelter said. In addition to the 101 dogs, the homeowner, who police said was “cooperative”, alsosurrendered21 chickens. Speaking to CBS 17, Ranlet said: “The dogs in our care are being medically evaluated and some moved into foster homes … They will be placed up for adoption once they have received veterinary care and recuperated. We need to make sure they are healthy and rehabilitated so they can start fresh as somebody’s family members.” It remains unclear whether the homeowner will face charges. The Guardian has reached out to the Raleigh police department for comment.",

    "title": "Israel kills more than 70 in Gaza, including 16 in attack on family home",
    "article_text": "Israeli raids across Gaza have killed at least 75 Palestinians, with rescuers scrambling to find dozens of bodies under the rubble after the bombing of a residential building in Gaza City described by the enclave’s civil defence as a “full-fledged massacre”. Palestinian Civil Defence spokesperson Mahmoud Basel told Al Jazeera that the Israeli army gave “no warning, no alert” before Saturday’s strike on the house in the Sabra neighbourhood of Gaza City that left at least 16 people dead, including women and children. “This is truly a full-fledged massacre … a building full of civilians,” said Basel, who added that approximately 85 people were believed to be trapped under the rubble. “We woke up to the strikes, destruction, yelling, rocks hitting us,” said Hamed Keheel, a displaced Palestinian at the site, noting that the attack had taken place on the second day ofEid al-Adha. “This is the occupation,” he said. “Instead of waking up to cheer our children and dress them up to enjoy Eid, we wake up to carry women and children’s bodies from under rubble.” Local resident Hassan Alkhor told Al Jazeera that the building belonged to the Abu Sharia family. “May God hold the Israeli forces and [Israeli Prime Minister] Netanyahu accountable,” he said. The Times of Israel newspaper cited the Israeli military as saying that it had killed top Palestinian fighter Asaad Abu Sharia in the attack. Abu Sharia was the leader of the Mujahideen Brigades, who the military claimed had participated in the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel in 2023. Hamas confirmed the killing in a statement shared on Telegram, saying that Abu Sharia’s brother, Ahmed Abu Sharia, had also been assassinated in the attack, which it said was “part of a series of brutal massacres against civilians”. Also on Saturday, Israeli forces killed at least eight Palestinians waiting near an aid distribution site run by the US-backedGaza Humanitarian Foundation(GHF) in Rafah in southern Gaza. The attack was the latest in a series of deadly incidents around the group’s operations that have killed 118 people and left others missing in less than two weeks. Gaza resident Samir Abu Hadid told the AFP news agency that thousands of people had gathered at the al-Alam roundabout near the aid site. “As soon as some people tried to advance towards the aid centre, the Israeli [forces] opened fire from armoured vehicles stationed near the centre, firing into the air and then at civilians,” Abu Hadid said. One woman told Al Jazeera her husband had been killed in the attack after going to the aid point to get “a handful of rice for our starving children”. “He said he felt he was walking towards death, I begged him not to leave. He insisted to find anything to feed our children,” she said. The GHF, a shadowy United States-backed private group engaged by Israel to distribute aid under the protection of its troops and security contractors, began operations in late May, replacing existing networks run by the United Nations and charities that have worked for decades. Critics say the group does not abide by humanitarian principles of neutrality, claiming that its operations weaponise aid, serving Israel’sstated aimsof ethnically cleansing large swaths of Gaza and controlling the entire enclave. GHF said on Saturday that it was unable to distribute any humanitarian relief because Hamas issued “direct threats” against its operations. “These threats made it impossible to proceed today without putting innocent lives at risk,” it said in a statement. Hamas told the Reuters news agency that it had no knowledge of these “alleged threats”. The United Nations, which has refused to cooperate with the GHF, has warned that most of Gaza’s 2.3 million population is at risk of famine after an 11-week Israeli blockade, with the rate of young children suffering from acute malnutrition nearly tripling. As Israel continued its attacks amid the looming famine, it emerged that health authorities had recorded more than 300 miscarriages over an 80-day period in the enclave. Expectant mothers face an increased risk of miscarriage and premature births, with basic medical supplies such as iron supplements and prenatal vitamins impossible to obtain. Brenda Kelly, a consultant obstetrician at Oxford University Hospital, told Al Jazeera that Gaza was “losing a future generation of children”, alluding to a “staggering rise” in stillbirths, miscarriages and pre-term births. “What we’re seeing now is the direct fallout of Israel’s weaponising of hunger in Gaza – impacting babies’ growth and growth restriction is one of the leading causes of miscarriages and stillbirth,” she said. Severe malnutrition among pregnant women is compounded by severe stress and psychological trauma, as well as repeated displacement and a lack of safe shelter, she said. Those babies that do survive face heightened health risks. “We know that famine experienced in-utero has lifelong consequences for children who then go into adulthood with much higher risks of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, as well as mental health disorders,” she said.",

    "title": "Clashes in Los Angeles as protests against immigration raids continue",
    "article_text": "Protesters have clashed with security forces in the city of Los Angeles in the United States for a second day following reports ofcontinued immigration raids, prompting warnings of prosecution from top government officials. The confrontations on Saturday took place in the Paramount area of southeast Los Angeles after reports of more immigration detentions outside a home improvement store. Dozens of green-uniformed security personnel in riot gear and gas masks lined up on the road strewn with overturned shopping carts, deploying tear gas as bystanders and protesters gathered on median strips and across the street. Protesters jeered at the officers, and called on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to leave the area. “ICE out of Paramount. We see you for what you are,” a woman said through a megaphone. “You are not welcome here.” One handheld sign read, “No Human Being is Illegal.” Some protesters hurled rocks, bottles and fireworks at the law enforcement officials, while pictures from the scene showed a car that had been set on fire. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted a message on social media addressing the “LA rioters”, warning that interference with immigration enforcement will not be tolerated. “You will not stop us or slow us down,” Noem said on the X platform. ICE “will enforce the law. And if you lay a hand on a law enforcement officer, you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” she wrote. US President Donald Trump’s border tsar, Tom Homan, said on Fox News that the National Guard would bedeployedin Los Angeles on Saturday evening. The protests began on Friday night after ICE agents conducted enforcement operations in the city and arrested at least 44 people on alleged immigration violations. The raids quickly triggered protests and demonstrators blocked entrances and exits for the Edward R Royal Federal Building in downtown LA, where the detainees were being processed. The protesters chanted, “Set them free, let them stay!” The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a statement that “1,000 rioters surrounded a federal law enforcement building and assaulted ICE law enforcement officers, slashed tires, defaced buildings, and taxpayer funded property”. Stephen Miller, an immigration hardliner and the White House deputy chief of staff, wrote on X that Friday’s demonstrations were “an insurrection against the laws and sovereignty of the United States”. On Saturday, he described the day’s protests as a “violent insurrection”. The immigration crackdown is part of Trump’s pledge to deport a record number of people living in the country without documentation, as the White House set a goal for ICE to arrest at least 3,000 immigrants a day. But people legally living in the country, including some with permanent residence, have also been caught up in the sweeping immigration crackdown, leading to legal challenges. Al Jazeera’s Robert Reynolds reporting from Compton in Los Angeles, near the Paramount area, said that police on Saturday used tear gas and flashbang grenades to disperse the crowd, which had gathered outside a Home Depot after news spread that federal immigration officers were conducting raids there. “The first confrontation started at a home repair warehouse where day labourers, many of whom are undocumented, gather to get jobs by the hour,” said Reynolds. “ICE raided that. They arrested a number of people. They were seen being taken away in a white bus with US marshals markings on the side. After that, hundreds of people showed up more or less spontaneously, yelling at the police, demanding that they leave their neighbourhood, demanding that they leave the undocumented migrants alone,” he said. “People expressing to us a deep sense of outrage that this is happening in the place where they live, their own neighbourhood,” Reynolds said. “There are police here now in quite large numbers in riot gear, who have been gradually pushing the remaining demonstrators back out of the street,” he added. There was no immediate comment from ICE or the DHS on the protests and the reported immigration sweeps on Saturday. The Democratic mayor of Los Angeles, Karen Bass, condemned the immigration raids in a statement on Friday. “I am deeply angered by what has taken place,” Bass said. “These tactics sow terror in our communities and disrupt basic principles of safety in our city. We will not stand for this.” ICE acting director Todd Lyons slammed Bass’s statement, claiming that the mayor had taken the side of “chaos and lawlessness over law enforcement”. “Make no mistake, ICE will continue to enforce our nation’s immigration laws and arrest criminal illegal aliens,” Lyons said. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), meanwhile, denounced the raids and referred to the immigration authorities as “masked goons”. “We call on our elected officials to uphold their commitment to all Angelenos – immigrants and non-immigrants alike – by taking all action necessary to grind this oppressive and vile paramilitary operation to a halt and keep our city safe and whole,” the group said in a statement. The confrontations in Los Angeles come after a “massive increase in the amount of arrests and the amount of enforcement being done by Immigration and Customs Enforcement,” said Marc Christopher, an immigration lawyer with Christopher & De Leon. “In the past, what we’ve seen is immigration [enforcement] would focus on individuals who had maybe committed crimes or had been arrested, or something of that nature. Now it’s more indiscriminate,” Christopher told Al Jazeera.",

    "title": "Nations League final: Spain-Portugal more than Yamal battle, says Ronaldo",
    "article_text": "Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo acknowledged that he was “another generation” to Spain starlet Lamine Yamal but saidSunday’s Nations League finalwas more than just a battle between the duo. The final in Munich has been framed as a showdown between veteran Ronaldo, 40, one of the game’s biggest names, and 17-year-old Yamal, the most exciting young talent in world football. Ronaldo scored the winner to send Portugal past Germany into the final, and Yamal was named man-of-the-match after bagging a brace in Spain’s wild 5-4 semifinal win over France. Ronaldo, however, said the focus on the two individuals was overblown, calling Spain “maybe the best national team in the world”. “There are different generations, one is coming in and another is exiting the stage. If you want to see me as another generation, then that’s OK. “When you talk about a clash between Cristiano and someone else, that’s not how it works. The media always try to hype things up, which is a normal thing, but it’s one team versus another team.” “You’ve been talking about Lamine a lot and you’re right to do so because he’s very good,” Ronaldo told journalists, adding, “but I’d like to talk about the team. “They’ve got Nico Williams, great midfielders like Pedri and their coach [Luis] de la Fuente is very good, very strong, very disciplined.” Portugal last beat their Iberian neighbours in a competitive fixture 21 years ago, in a match which Ronaldo started. Like Yamal, Ronaldo burst onto the scene at a young age. Aged just 18, Ronaldo impressed so much for boyhood side Sporting in a 3-1 win over Manchester United in a friendly in Lisbon that the English club decided to buy him, bringing him to Old Trafford less than a week later. Like a young Ronaldo, Yamal has consistently impressed since bursting onto the scene, winning a league and cup double with Barcelona this season after lifting the Euro 2024 title in Germany last year. The Portuguese veteran asked the media to allow the teenager to grow and improve without pressure, reminding them the Spanish star “with funny hair” was just “three years older than my son”. “The kid has been doing very well, but what I ask is for you to let him grow, not put him under pressure. For the good of football, we need to let him grow in his own way and enjoy the talent he has.” Spain coach Luis de la Fuente said Yamal was “only 17, but very mature for his age. Well-prepared, intelligent – he lives life as if it’s all normal, and that’s what we want for him”. De la Fuente said the national side were “trying to walk alongside [Yamal] in his education,” but added “you’d be surprised, shocked, how calm he is. “He’s special. For some people, this would be a situation of maximum stress. But for him, he’s relaxed, he’s in control – he masters the situation.” The coach also took time to praise Ronaldo, calling him “a legend in football and an example of the values I like: effort, work rate, sacrifice, getting better every day and never letting your guard down. “Portugal are led by a footballer who will go down in history with an indelible legacy.” Both Spain and Portugal have already won the Nations League. Spain are the current champions from their win in 2023, while Portugal won the inaugural tournament back in 2019. Spain have won 16 and drawn two of their past 18 fixtures – and have not lost a competitive match since March 2023. Spain forward Mikel Oyarzabal told reporters his side “do not think we are better than anyone,” but “we trust ourselves 100 percent and know we can compete in every game. “We’ve shown that over the years. Our level is very high.”",

    "title": "Israelis demand captives’ return; Europe rallies for end to Gaza genocide",
    "article_text": "Thousands of Israeli protesters in Tel Aviv have again called for the return of captives held in Gaza and an immediate ceasefire, while hundreds of thousands of pro-Palestine supporters gathered in Rome denouncing the Italian government’s “complicity” in the war. Captive families and antigovernment protesters gathered in front of Israel’s army headquarters on Saturday, several hours after Thailand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that Israeli forces had recovered the body of a Thai captive. In a statement, the Israeli army said on Saturday morning that the body of Nattapong Pinta was retrieved from the Rafah area in southern Gaza after he was taken captive during Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum wrote on X that it “bows its head in sorrow over the murder of Nattapong Pinta”. “The time is running out for all 55 hostages. We must bring them all home, Now!,” the group wrote on X. The spokesperson of Hamas’s armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, Abu Obeida, warned that an Israeli captive, Matan Zangauker, is being held in an area targeted by the Israeli army. He warned that if Zangauker were killed during an attempt to free him, the Israeli military would be responsible. The captive’s mother, Einav Zangauker, speaking at the Tel Aviv protest, criticised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for neglecting those being held in Gaza. “The military pressure is closing in on [my son] and is placing him in immediate danger. The decision to expand the ground operation comes at the cost of Matan’s life and the lives of all the hostages,” she said. “[Netanyahu] continues to sacrifice the hostages. He is using the [Israeli military] not to protect Israel’s security, but to continue the war and protect his government.” Itzik Horn, the father of captive Eitan Horn, said at a news conference in Tel Aviv that the United States Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff should push for a new ceasefire proposal aimed at securing the release of the captives. “Present Netanyahu and Hamas with an offer with an ultimatum to end the war. This is likely the only way to return the hostages,” Horn said. He called on Witkoff to “set aside the Netanyahu framework for extending the war” for the return of the captives. Police prevented activists from the NGO, Looking the Occupation in the Eye, from reaching the protest area in Tel Aviv, according to reports in the Israeli media. The activists were reportedly carrying placards protesting against Israeli war crimes and ethnic cleansing in Gaza. אלימות מצד המשטרה, דחיפות וצעקות לעבר מפגינים הנושאים שלטים הקוראים להפסקת המלחמה. 07.06.2025 תל אביב 🎥אריק סגלpic.twitter.com/2vJ3lFkXDl — אלימות ישראל (@Alimut_Israel)June 7, 2025 Translation: Police pushing and shouting at protesters carrying signs calling for an end to the war. During the Hamas attack, which killed 1,139 people in southern Israel, the group abducted 251 people; following a series of prisoner-for-captive exchanges with the Israeli government, the group are currently holding 55 captives in Gaza, a number of whom are dead. Israel’s war on Gaza has now killed at least 54,772 Palestinians and injured 125,834 others, Gaza’s Health Ministry reported. In the meantime, across Europe, pro-Palestine demonstrators called for an end to the Israeli genocidal assault in Gaza. In Rome, hundreds of thousands of people marched through the city in a protest called by opposition parties slamming the government’s “complicity” in the war. The leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, Elly Schlein, called the turnout “an enormous popular response” in opposition to Israel’s actions in the besieged and bombarded enclave. The demonstration was “to say enough to the massacre of Palestinians, to say enough to the crimes of Netanyahu’s far-right government” and to show the world “another Italy”, Schlein told reporters. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has come under increasing pressure to take a stronger stance on the war in Gaza as she has backed Israel and Netanyahu throughout, while admitting difficult conversations with the Israeli leader of late. In the British capital, London, antigovernment demonstrators held placards demanding “Cut war, not welfare.” Speaking at the Whitehall rally, former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said with the “abominable, deliberate starvation of children in Gaza and the genocide that’s inflicted against the Palestinian people”, a world of “peace” was needed. “We need a world of peace that will come through the vision of peace, the vision of disarmament and the vision of actually challenging the causes of war, which leads to the desperation and the refugee flows of today,” he said. Pro-Palestine protests were also held Saturday in Denmark, Sweden, and Germany, where demonstrators raised banners calling for an end to the Israeli genocide against Palestinians.",

    "title": "Trump warns Musk of ‘serious consequences’ if he funds Democrats",
    "article_text": "United States President Donald Trump has warned billionaire former ally, and campaign benefactor to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars, Elon Musk against funding Democratic candidates in the country’s 2026 midterm elections as the pair’s volcanicbreak-upcontinues to play out on the world stage. “He’ll have to pay very serious consequences if he does that,” Trump told US network NBC News in an interview published Saturday, without spelling out what the repercussions might be for the tech mogul, whose businesses benefit from lucrative US federal contracts. Trump aides, various Republicans, and key wealthy donors to the GOP  have urged the two to temper the bitter feud and make peace, fearing irreparable political and economic fallout. But, asked whether he thought his relationship with the Tesla and SpaceX CEO was over, Trump said, “I would assume so, yeah”. The interview featured Trump’s most extensive comments yet on the spectacular bust-up that saw Musk criticising his signature tax and spending bill as an “abomination”, tensions escalating after he went on to highlight one-time links between the president and the late sex offenderJeffrey Epstein. By Saturday morning, Musk had deleted his “big bomb” allegation that Trump featured in unreleased government files on former associates of Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 while facing sex trafficking charges. “That is the real reason they have not been made public,” he said in Thursday’s post on X. The Trump administration has acknowledged it is reviewing tens of thousands of documents, videos, and investigative material that his “MAGA” movement says will unmask public figures complicit in Epstein’s crimes. Trump was named in a trove of deposition and statements linked to Epstein that were unsealed by a New York judge in early 2024. The president has not been accused of any wrongdoing, but he had a long and well-publicised friendship with Epstein. Trump has denied spending time on Little Saint James, the private redoubt in the US Virgin Islands where prosecutors alleged Epstein trafficked underage girls for sex. Just last week, Trump had given Musk a glowing send-off as he left his cost-cutting role at the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Vice President JD Vance said Musk was making a “huge mistake” going after Trump, though he also tried to downplay his attacks as the frustrations of an “emotional guy”. “I hope that eventually Elon comes back into the fold. Maybe that’s not possible now because he’s gone so nuclear,” he said in the interview with comedian Theo Von, released Friday. Trump also told NBC that it was the Department of Justice, rather than he, that had decided to return Salvadoran immigrantKilmar Abrego Garciato the US, where he faces charges of transporting undocumented migrants inside the country. Trump added that he had not spoken to El Salvador President Nayib Bukele about Abrego Garcia’s return.",

Once their friendship reaped rewards for both: Musk donated around hundreds of millions of dollars to Trump’s re-election campaign and the president created a role for Musk in his government. But political, or fiscal, differences soured the relationship, and what was once a mutually beneficial alliance deteriorated into an exchange of insults on social media.

    "article_text": "Coco Gauff has won the French Open for the first time by defeating top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-4 in the final. The second-ranked Gauff came out on top of Saturday’s contest that was full of tension and momentum swings to claim her second major trophy after the 2023 US Open, where she also came from a set down to beat Sabalenka in the final. It was the first number one vs number two final in Paris since 2013, when Serena Williams defeated Maria Sharapova, and just the second in the last 30 years. After Sabalenka sent a backhand wide on Gauff’s second match point, the 21-year-old American fell onto her back, covering her face with both hands before resting her forehand on the clay. After greeting Sabalenka at the net, she hugged film director Spike Lee and celebrated with her entourage, three years after she lost her first final at Roland-Garros. Sabalenka started the deciding set strongly, sticking to her high-risk approach to hold her first service game. Gauff responded by raising her level, winning a superb rally in the third game that drew loud cheers and applause from the crowd. After an intense exchange of drop shots, Gauff hit a lob that Sabalenka chased down before attempting a shot between her legs — only for Gauff to intercept it at the net and finish with a winner. Gauff was consistent from the baseline and earned a break point, which she converted when Sabalenka double-faulted, giving her a 2-1 lead. Sabalenka turned towards her box and shouted in frustration, but then regained her composure, breaking back to level the match at 3-3. She was broken again at love, however, and Gauff then held serve twice to claim the title after a match that lasted 2 hours, 38 minutes.",

    "title": "Yemen’s al-Qaeda leader threatens Trump, Musk over Israel’s war on Gaza",
    "article_text": "The leader of al-Qaeda’s Yemen branch has targeted US President Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk over United States backing for Israel’s ongoing war on the Gaza Strip and its besieged Palestinian population. “There are no red lines after what happened and is happening to our people in Gaza,” said Saad bin Atef al-Awlaki in a half-hour video message that was spread online Saturday by supporters ofal-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula(AQAP), the Yemeni branch of the armed group. “Reciprocity is legitimate,” he said. Al-Awlaki’s video message also included calls for so-called lone wolves to assassinate leaders in Egypt, Jordan and the Gulf Arab states over thewar,which has decimated Gaza, killing at least 54,772 Palestinians over the past 20 months. The message featured images of Trump and Musk, US Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth, as well as logos of Musk’s businesses – including electric carmaker Tesla. Born in 2009 from the merger of al-Qaeda’s Yemeni and Saudi factions, AQAP is completely distinct from Yemen’sHouthirebel group, which controls most of the country and agreed to a ceasefire with the US earlier this month. AQAP grew and developed amid the chaos of Yemen’s war, which has pitted the Houthis against a Saudi-led coalition backing the government since 2015. Al-Awlaki became the group’s leader in 2024, replacing predecessor Khalid Batarfi, who died that year. He already has a $6m US bounty on his head, having, as Washington puts it, “publicly called for attacks against the United States and its allies”. Though believed to be weakened in recent years due to infighting and suspected US drone strikes killing its leaders, the group had been considered the most dangerous branch of al-Qaeda still operating since the US killing of founder Osama bin Laden in 2011. United Nations experts estimate AQAP has between 3,000 and 4,000 active fighters and passive members, claiming that it raises money by robbing banks and money exchange shops, as well as by smuggling weapons, counterfeiting currencies and conducting ransom operations. The Houthis have previously denied working with AQAP, though the latter’s targeting of the Houthis has dropped in recent years, while its fighters keep attacking the Saudi-led coalition forces. Now, with its focus on Israel’s war on Gaza, AQAP appears to be following the lead of the Houthi group, which has launched missile attacks on Israel and targeted commercial vessels moving through the Red Sea in solidarity with Palestinians under Israeli fire. “As the Houthis gain popularity as leaders of the ‘Arab and Muslim world’s resistance’ against Israel, al-Awlaki seeks to challenge their dominance by presenting himself as equally concerned about the situation in Gaza,” said Mohammed al-Basha, a Yemen expert with the Basha Report risk advisory firm. “For a national security and foreign policy community increasingly disengaged from Yemen, this video is a clear reminder: Yemen still matters,” he said.",

The Portugal star confirmed on Saturday that he received “quite a few” offers from participating clubs to play for them at the tournament starting June 14, but had decided against accepting any of them. “Some things make sense to talk about, other things don’t, and, as a person says, you can’t take part in everything,” Ronaldo said. “You have to think about the short, medium and long term. It’s a decision practically made on my part not to go to the Club World Cup, but I’ve had quite a few invitations to go.” Ronaldo was speaking in Munich a day before Portugal’s UEFA Nations League final against Spain. The 40-year-old scored his 137th international goal in a 2-1 semifinal victory against Germany on Wednesday to book Portugal’s spot in the final. “This is irrelevant right now,” Ronaldo said when first asked about the FIFA Club World Cup. “It makes no sense to talk about anything other than the national team.”",

    "title": "Syria confirms closure of civil war-era desert camp, displaced return home",
    "article_text": "The notorious Rukban displacement camp in the Syrian desert, a dark emblem of the country’s civil war, has closed, with the last remaining families returning to their hometowns. Syrian Information Minister Hamza al-Mustafa said on Saturday on X that with the dismantlement of the camp, “a tragic and sorrowful chapter of displacement stories created by the bygone regime’s war machine comes to a close”. “Rukban was not just a camp, it was the triangle of death that bore witness to the cruelty of siege and starvation, where the regime left people to face their painful fate in the barren desert,” he added. The camp, established in 2014 at the height of the country’s ruinous civil war, was built in a deconfliction zone controlled by the United States-led coalition forces fighting against ISIL (ISIS). The camp was used to house those fleeing ISIL fighters and bombardment by the then-government of President Bashar al-Assad, seeking refuge and hoping to eventually cross the border into Jordan. But al-Assad’s regime rarely allowed aid to enter the camp as neighbouring countries also blocked access to the area, rendering Rukban isolated for years under a punishing siege. About 8,000 people lived in the camp, staying in mud-brick houses with food and basic goods smuggled in at high prices. But after al-Assad was toppled following a lightning offensive led by the current president of Syria’s interim government, Ahmed al-Sharaa, in December, families began leaving the camp and returning home. Al-Sharaa has promised to unite Syria following the fall of al-Assad and rebuild the country at home and rejoin the international fold abroad. Last month, al-Sharaa met with world leaders, including United States President Donald Trump, who announced that sanctions on Syria would be removed in a decision that would allow the country a “chance at greatness”. The European Union followed suit and also lifted sanctions. Both moves have given Syria a critical lifeline to economic recovery after nearly 14 years of war and economic devastation. Yasmine al-Salah, who returned to her home after nine years of displacement in the Rukban camp and marked the Muslim celebration of Eid al-Adha, told The Associated Press news agency on Friday that her feelings are a “happiness that cannot be described”. “Even though our house is destroyed, and we have no money, and we are hungry, and we have debts, and my husband is old and can’t work, and I have kids – still, it’s a castle in my eyes,” al-Salah said. Her home in the town of al-Qaryatan in the eastern part of the Homs province was damaged during the war. Syrian Minister for Emergency Situations and Disasters Raed al-Saleh said on X said the camp’s closure marks “the end of one of the harshest humanitarian tragedies faced by our displaced people”. “We hope this step marks the beginning of a path that ends the suffering of the remaining camps and returns their residents to their homes with dignity and safety,” he added. According to the International Organization for Migration, 1.87 million Syrians have returned to their homes since al-Assad’s fall.",

    "title": "Macron to visit Greenland to boost ‘European unity’ amid Trump threats",
    "article_text": "French President Emmanuel Macron will visit Greenland this month, the French presidency has announced, in the wake of United States expressions of interest in taking over the mineral-rich Arctic island. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and the French leader said they will meet in the semi-autonomous Danish territory on June 15, hosted by Greenland’s new Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen. The talks between the leaders will focus on North Atlantic and Arctic security, climate change, energy transition and critical minerals, the French presidency said in a statement on Saturday. Frederiksen welcomed Macron’s upcoming visit and said in a statement that it is “another concrete testimony of European unity” in the face of a “difficult foreign policy situation”. The visit comes amid US President Donald Trump’s threats to annex Greenland. This trip aims to “strengthen cooperation” with the Arctic territory in these areas and to “contribute to the strengthening of European sovereignty”, the French presidency statement stressed. Since his return to the White House in January, Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to control the immense Arctic territory, rich in mineral resources and strategically located, “one way or another”. “We need Greenland for international safety and security. We need it. We have to have it,” Trumpsaidin an interview in March. The US has also suggested that Russia and China have strategic designs on Greenland. Trump’s Vice President JD Vance visited the US military base in Pituffik, northwest Greenland, on March 28, in a trip seen as a provocation at the time. Vance accused Denmark of not having “done a good job for the people of Greenland”, not investing enough in the local economy and “not ensuring its security”. The vice president stressed that the US has “no option” but to take a significant position to ensure the security of the island as he encouraged a push in Greenland for independence from Denmark. “I think that they ultimately will partner with the United States,” Vancesaid. “We could make them much more secure. We could do a lot more protection. And I think they’d fare a lot better economically as well.” Denmark, for its part, insists that Greenland “is not for sale”. Addressing American leaders from the huge island, the prime minister said in early April: “You cannot annex another country.” Faced with American threats, Denmark announced 14.6 billion Danish kroner ($2.1bn) in financial commitments for Arctic security, covering three new naval vessels, long-range drones and satellites. Greenland’s main political parties, which are in favour of the territory’s independence in the long term, are also against the idea of joining the US. According to a poll published at the end of January, the population of 57,000 mostly Inuit inhabitants, including more than 19,000 in the capital, Nuuk, rejected any prospect of becoming American. Incoming Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen told a news conference in March that the territory needed unity at this time. “It is very important that we put aside our disagreements and differences … because only in this way will we be able to cope with the heavy pressure we are exposed to from outside,” he said.",

    "title": "Israeli attacks in Gaza kill more than 70, including several near aid site",
    "article_text": "Israeli attacks have killed at least 75 Palestinians across Gaza, medical sources have told Al Jazeera, including at least 16 in a strike on Gaza City’s Sabra neighbourhood, which the Civil Defence described as a “full-fledged massacre”. Dozens were also wounded in that Israeli attack on Saturday. Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary, reporting from Deir el-Balah, said of the attack in Gaza City: “Sources are saying there are dozens of Palestinians still trapped under the rubble. The Civil Defence teams are trying to retrieve bodies and rescue as many Palestinians as possible.” The Israeli military’s Arabic-language spokesman Avichay Adraee announced the latest forced evacuation orders to neighbourhoods in northern Gaza, including northwest of Gaza City and Jabalia. Forces will “attack each zone used to launch rockets,” calling on residents to “immediately” move to the southern areas of the enclave, Adraee wrote on X Saturday. In the south of the besieged enclave, the Palestinian Red Crescent said al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis was “no longer accessible” after Israeli forces designated the surrounding area a “dangerous combat zone” and ordered evacuations. “There are many patients and medical staff in the hospital,” the group said in a statement, urging international organisations to intervene, provide protection for medical sites, and open safe corridors for aid and medical supplies. Among those killed in Israeli attacks today were eight people in a shooting incident near an aid distribution site west of Rafah in southern Gaza. Palestinians in Gaza have gathered at al-Alam roundabout near Rafah almost daily since late May to collect humanitarian aid, at a centre about 1km (0.6 miles) away, operated by the shadowy US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). Nearly 120 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire near these GFH sites since they were introduced. Samir Abu Hadid, who was there early Saturday, told the AFP news agency that thousands of people had gathered near the roundabout. “As soon as some people tried to advance towards the aid centre, the Israeli occupation forces opened fire from armoured vehicles stationed near the centre, firing into the air and then at civilians,” Abu Hadid said. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. The GHF had said on Friday that its aid centres would remain closed untilfurther noticedue to security concerns, just days after several deadly incidents near its aid hubs. “Operations at our distribution points have been paused until further notice,” a spokesperson for the GHF said on Friday, despite warnings from humanitarian agencies that the territory is on the brink of famine. Israel last month partially lifted a total blockade on humanitarian supplies entering Gaza that had been in effect since March 2, but rights groups and the United Nations have warned that only a trickle of aid has been allowed into the territory. The UN, which has refused to cooperate with the GHF over neutrality concerns, has warned that Gaza’s entire population of more than two million people was at risk of starvation. In Israel, Defence Minister Israel Katz announced that the military had recovered the remains of Thai national Nattapong Pinta from Rafah, southern Gaza. Pinta, an agricultural worker, was seized during the Hamas-led assault on October 7, 2023, from Kibbutz Nir Oz. Israeli officials said he had been held by the Mujahideen Brigades, a Palestinian armed group. His remains were found alongside those of two Israeli American captives retrieved earlier in the week. Pinta’s family in Thailand has been notified.",

    "title": "ICE launches ‘military-style’ raids in Los Angeles: What we know",
    "article_text": "Los Angeles witnessed a series ofcoordinated immigration raidsby United States law enforcement officials on Friday, resulting in the arrest of dozens and igniting widespread protests. The raids, which were carried out in a military-style operation, have intensified concerns about the force used by federal immigration officials and the rights of undocumented individuals. Here is what we know about the raids and the latest on the ground. Federal agents from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) conducted a series of “immigration enforcement operations” across Los Angeles on Friday morning. Individuals suspected of “immigration violations and the use of fraudulent documents” were arrested. The arrests were carried out without judicial warrants, according to multiple legal observers and confirmed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), which did not take part in the raids, was called in to quell ensuing protests. The raids were part of a broader initiative under the Trump administration’sintensified immigration policies. The raids focused on several locations in downtown LA and its immediate surroundings. These spots are known to havesignificant migrant populationsand labour-intensive industries. Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition of Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA), which covers California – home to the US’s largest population of undocumented people – said advocates had recorded enforcement activity at seven sites. This included two Home Depot stores in the Westlake District of Los Angeles, a doughnut shop and the clothing wholesaler, Ambiance Apparel in the Fashion District of downtown Los Angeles. Other locations in which raids were carried out included day labour centres and one other Ambiance facility near 15th Street and Santa Fe Avenue in south Los Angeles. ICE and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) reported the “administrative arrest” of 44 individuals for immigration-related offences. An administrative arrest, unlike a criminal arrest, refers to detention for civil immigration violations such as overstaying a visa or lacking legal status, and does not require criminal charges. These arrests can result in detention, deportation, temporary re-entry bans and denial of future immigration requests. Advocates believe the number of arrests made was higher, however. Caleb Soto, of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, told Al Jazeera that between 70 and 80 people had been detained, but only three lawyers have been allowed access to the detention centre where they were being held to provide legal advice. Soto added that members of the community had effectively been “kidnapped” as officials, wearing masks had not shown warrants or any form of documentation when carrying out arrests. Additionally, David Huerta, president of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) California, was arrested for allegedly obstructing federal agents during the raids. Huerta was reportedly injured during the arrest and received medical treatment at Los Angeles General Medical Center before being taken into custody. What sets these raids apart from typical civil enforcement actions was their military-style execution, experts say. According to witnesses, legal observers and advocacy groups, federal agents involved in the operations were heavily armed and dressed in tactical gear, with some wearing camouflage and carrying rifles. Agents arrived in unmarked black SUVs and armoured vehicles and, at certain points, sealed off entire streets around targeted buildings. Drones were reportedly used for surveillance in some areas and access to sites was blocked off with yellow tape, similar to measures which would be taken during a high-threat counterterrorism or drug bust operation. TheACLU describedthe show of force as an “oppressive and vile paramilitary operation”. Civil liberties groups said the tactics used had created panic in local communities and may have violated protocols for civil immigration enforcement. As news of the raids spread via social media and through immigrant advocacy networks, hundreds of protesters gathered outside the Edward R Roybal Federal Building in downtown Los Angeles, where detainees were being processed. Demonstrators blocked entrances and exits to the building, chanted slogans and demanded the release of those arrested. Some spray-painted anti-ICE slogans on the building’s exterior walls. Several protesters attempted to physically stop ICE vehicles, leading to confrontations with law enforcement. LAPD officers issued dispersal orders and warned protesters that they would be subject to arrest if they remained in the area. To enforce the order, officers in riot gear deployed tear gas, pepper spray and “less-lethal munitions”, including firing rubber bullets to disperse the crowd. A citywide tactical alert was also issued, requiring all LAPD officers to remain on duty. Shortly after 7pm on Friday [02:00 GMT Saturday], the LAPD declared the protests to be an “unlawful assembly”, meaning that those who failed to leave the area could be subject to arrest. The declaration appeared to remain in effect until the crowd dispersed later that evening, though no formal end time was publicly announced. US media outlets and rights groups reported that hundreds of detainees, including children, were held overnight in the basement of the federal building without access to beds, blankets or adequate food and water. However, an ICE spokesperson told CBS News that the agency “categorically refutes the assertions made by immigration activists in Los Angeles”, stating that it takes its mandate to care for people in custody “seriously”. The status of all individuals detained remains unclear. While some have been released, others continue to be held and details about their current locations or conditions have not been fully disclosed. Local and state officials condemned the raids and the manner in which they were conducted. In a statement shared on X on Friday, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said such operations “sow terror in our communities and disrupt basic principles of safety in our city”. We will not stand for this.pic.twitter.com/Ug1CN4JKOz — Mayor Karen Bass (@MayorOfLA)June 6, 2025 California Governor Gavin Newsomissued a statementdescribing the operations as “cruel” and “chaotic”, adding that they are an attempt “to meet an arbitrary arrest quota”. All 15 members of the Los Angeles City Council issued a joint statement denouncing the raids. Some Trump administration officials, on the other hand, defended the actions and criticised local leaders for pushing back. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, for instance, suggested that Mayor Karen Bass was undermining federal law. You have no say in this at all. Federal law is supreme and federal law will be enforced.https://t.co/N53UBl3UM4 — Stephen Miller (@StephenM)June 6, 2025",

    "title": "Israel’s strategic failure is now apparent",
    "article_text": "Since the mid-1960s, Israel has received significant military and diplomatic support from successive administrations in the United States. But never has it enjoyed such unconditional support as it has in the past eight years – under the first and second administrations of President Donald Trump and the administration of President Joe Biden. As a result, Israel has started openly pursuing its greatest Zionist dream: expanding state borders to achieve Greater Israel and accelerating the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people from their homeland. Although the Israeli state may appear more powerful than ever and overly confident that it will achieve regional dominance, its current position paradoxically reflects a strategic failure. The reality is that after nearly eight decades of existence, Israel has failed to achieve legitimacy in the eyes of the region’s peoples and lasting security for itself. Its present resurgence will secure neither. And that is because its foreign, domestic and military policies are based on a settler-colonial logic which makes them untenable in the long run. Since its founding in 1948, Israel has sought to convince the world and its Jewish citizens that it was created “on a land without a people”. While this narrative has successfully caught on – particularly among the younger generations of Israelis – the forefathers of the Israeli state openly spoke about “colonisation” and settling a land with a hostile native population. Theodor Herzl, considered the father of modern Zionism,planned to reach outto well-known British colonialist Cecil Rhodes, who led the British colonisation of Southern Africa, for advice on and approval of his plan to colonise Palestine. Vladimir Jabotinsky, a revisionist Zionist who founded the far-right Zionist group Betar in Latvia, strategised in his writings on ways to address native resistance. In his 1923 essay The Iron Wall, he wrote: “Every native population in the world resists colonists as long as it has the slightest hope of being able to rid itself of the danger of being colonised. That is what the Arabs in Palestine are doing.” This settler-colonial mentality played a central role in shaping the domestic, foreign and military policies of the newly founded Israel. Today, almost 80 years after the creation of the Israeli state, expansionism and aggressive military posturing continue to define the Israeli regional strategy. Despite official rhetoric about seeking peace and normalisation of relations in the region, the Israeli aspiration to achieve a Greater Israel – one that includes not only occupied Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, but also parts of modern-day Egypt, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan – persists. That has been apparent in public discourse and government actions. Settler activists have openly talked about an Israel stretching from the Nile to the Euphrates river. Government advisershave pennedarticles about “reconquering Sinai”, “dismembering Egypt” and precipitating the “dissolution of Jordan”. Prime ministers have stood in front of the United Nations General Assembly, holding maps of Greater Israel. The idea of Greater Israel has been widely accepted across the Zionist political spectrum, both on the right and on the left. The primary differences have been in how and when to advance this vision, and whether it requires the expulsion of Palestinians or their segregation. Expansionist policies have been applied under all Israeli governments – from those led by left-wing Mapai Labor to those led by right-wing Likud. Since the 1949 armistice, Israel has occupied the West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem, the Golan Heights, Sinai (twice), southern Lebanon (twice) and now most recently, more parts of southern Syria. Meanwhile, its colonisation of the occupied Palestinian territories has proceeded at an accelerated pace. The number of Jewish colonial settlers in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, was approximately250,000 in 1993;by October 7, 2023, this number had risen to503,732 in the West Bankand233,600 in East Jerusalem. Settlements in Gaza were dismantled in 2005, but plans are being made for recolonisation, as the current Israeli government eyes the full ethnic cleansing of the strip. Today, there is no major political force in Israel that looks beyond the direct application of naked military power to maintain and protect colonisation activities. This mindset is not limited to politicians but is also a widespread conviction among the Israeli public. A June2024 surveyfound that 70 percent of Jewish Israelis think settlements either help national security or do not interfere with it; aMarch 2025 pollshowed that 82 percent of Jewish Israelis support the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians in Gaza. The settler-colonial mindset at the core of the Israeli state has precluded the emergence of a genuine drive for peace. As a result, successive Israeli governments have continued to pursue war, colonisation and expansion, even when seemingly embracing peace talks. In the 1990s, Israel had the opportunity to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict by withdrawing from the territories occupied in 1967 and accepting the creation of an independent Palestinian state. Instead, it used the negotiations as a smokescreen to advance settler-colonial policies. Even leaders like Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was hailed as a peacemaker and assassinated for it by a Jewish extremist, did not really envision Israelis and Palestinians living side by side. Under his government and during the peace negotiations, the expansion of Jewish settlements continued at a steady pace, while plans for a segregation wall on occupied Palestinian land were pushed forward. Meanwhile, Rabin and other Israeli leaders involved in the peace negotiations focused primarily on normalising Israel’s existence as it was, without addressing the root causes of the conflict. They sought to pacify Palestinian resistance, rather than establish durable peace. The absence of a peace camp is not only at the leadership level but also at the societal one. While the Israeli society has active movements for social causes, settlers’ coalitions, and now a movement pushing for continuing the prisoner exchanges with Hamas, it lacks a genuine grassroots peace movement that recognises Palestinian rights. This is in sharp contrast to other settler-colonial societies, in which there was a push from within to end colonialism. During the French colonisation of Algeria, for example, an anti-colonial movement within France openly supported the Algerian armed resistance. During the apartheid era in South Africa, white activists joined the anti-apartheid struggle and helped sway domestic attitudes. In Israel, Jewish supporters of Palestinian rights are so few that they are easily ostracised and marginalised, facing death threats and often feeling compelled to leave the country. The absence of a genuine peace camp reflects the inherent flaw of settler-colonial Israel. It has no coherent political strategy to address broader issues, such as coexistence in the region, which requires acknowledging the interests of others, especially the national rights of the Palestinian people. This makes the settler colony incapable of peace. Historically, settler-colonies have always had to rely on outside support to sustain themselves. Israel is no different. For decades, it has enjoyed far-reaching support from Western Europe and the United States, which have provided it with a significant strategic edge. But this Israeli reliance on Western backing also poses a long-term strategic threat. It makes the country dependent and unable to function like a normal sovereign nation. Other countries in the region will continue to exist even if they lose support from their Western allies, with only their regimes potentially changing. But that is not the case for Israel. This unlimited and extravagant support for Israel, aimed at maintaining its dominance as the primary regional power, is likely to backfire. The growing imbalance of power is generating pressure not only on antagonist countries like Iran, but on other regional players such as Turkiye, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. They increasingly feel that the Western push to defend Israeli interests is infringing on their own. This situation is likely to push them to increasingly seek alliances beyond the Western bloc to counterbalance this influence. China offers a viable alternative, as it is not a strategic ally of Israel. A gradual opening to China can shift the political dynamics of the region in the coming years, beyond the capacity of Israel and its allies to control them. That will certainly undermine the Israeli plans to establish regional hegemony. But Israel faces not only the risk that Western dominance could be challenged from the East, but also that Western societies could pressure their governments to stop backing it. The Israeli genocidal policies, especially since October 7, 2023, have spurred a profound shift in public opinion across the world, including in Europe and North America. Israel stands accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice, its prime minister has an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court and Israeli soldiers are facing charges in many countries around the world. As a result, the Israeli state has notably lost support among those on the left and centre of the political spectrum in the West. While it still manages to maintain backing in high-level European and American political and military circles, this support is becoming increasingly unreliable in the long term. This uncertainty is further aggravated by therise of isolationism on the right in the US. If these trends continue, Israel may eventually run out of dependable supporters in the West and lose its financial and military advantage. The limits of the Israeli settler-colonial state strategy are increasingly becoming clear. The continued use of settler-colonial policies, characterised by excessive violence, along with the pursuit of regional hegemony, is pushing Israel into an untenable position. The Israeli leadership may be living in a fantasy world, thinking it can pull off a “New World” model on Palestine and exterminate its population to fully colonise it; or to declare itself officially an apartheid state, seeking to make Palestinian subjugation legal. But in the historical and geopolitical context of the Middle East, neither of these fantasies is viable. Global pressure is coming to bear. The expulsion of the people of Gaza has been outright rejected. The Palestinian people, like any other nation that has survived brutal colonisation, will not leave their country and disappear, nor will they accept life under a colonial apartheid regime. Israeli leaders may do well to start imagining the very real possibility of sharing land and accepting equal rights, and start preparing the Israeli society for it.

    "title": "Thailand and Cambodia reinforce troops along disputed border: Thai minister",
    "article_text": "Thailand has reinforced its military presence along a disputed border with Cambodia following an increase in troops on the other side, the Thai defence minister has said. Tensionsbetween the two Southeast Asian countries have been rising since a Cambodian soldier was killed on May 28 in a brief skirmish in an undemarcated border area. Since the incident, the two governments have been exchanging carefully worded statements committing to dialogue. Thailand’s Defence Minister Phumtham Wechayachai, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said on Saturday that Cambodia had rejected proposals in bilateral talks held on Thursday that could have led to a de-escalation. “Furthermore, there has been a reinforcement of military presence, which has exacerbated tensions along the border,” Phumtham said in a statement. “Consequently, the Royal Thai Government has deemed it necessary to implement additional measures and to reinforce our military posture accordingly.” He did not provide further details on the extent of reinforcements by either side. In a separate statement on Saturday, the Thai army said Cambodian civilians had also repeatedly made incursions into Thailand’s territory. “These provocations, and the buildup of military forces, indicate a clear intent to use force,” the Thai army said, adding it would take control of all Thai checkpoints along the Cambodia border. There was no immediate comment from Cambodia. “This is our stance, not to initiate conflict, but to defend ourselves,” Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said in a speech earlier on Saturday. “Our guiding principles are … respect for international legal frameworks. These grounded strategies are key to safeguarding our nation’s sovereignty,” he said, adding that its armed forces were ready to defend against aggression. Thailand remains committed to pursuing bilateral dialogue as a means to restore stability, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Saturday. “The Thai side reaffirms its readiness to engage through established bilateral mechanisms, particularly the upcoming meeting of the Thailand-Cambodia Joint Boundary Commission (JBC), scheduled for June 14,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nikorndej Balankura told reporters. “We sincerely hope that the negotiations will proceed in good faith,” he added. The reinforcements come despute efforts by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who is the current chair of the Southeast Asian ASEAN bloc, and China to reduce tensions, but the border remains disputed. Thailand and Cambodia have for more than a century contested sovereignty at various undemarcated points along their 817km (508-mile) land border. Tension escalated in 2008 over an 11th-century Hindu temple, leading to skirmishes over several years and at least a dozen deaths, including during a weeklong exchange of artillery fire in 2011. A meeting of the Cambodia-Thailand Joint Boundary Commission – which addresses border demarcation issues – is scheduled for June 14.",

    "title": "Iran condemns ‘racist mentality’ behind US travel ban",
    "article_text": "Iran has sharply criticised United States President Donald Trump’stravel banon its nationals and those of several countries, calling it “racist” and a sign of deep-rooted hostility towards Iranians and Muslims. Trump earlier this weeksigned an executive orderthat bars and restricts travellers from 19 countries, including several African and Middle Eastern nations. The policy, set to take effect on Monday, echoes measures introduced during Trump’s previous term in office from 2017-2021. In the executive order, Trump said he “must act to protect the national security” of the US. Alireza Hashemi-Raja, who heads the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ department for Iranians abroad, said on Saturday that the decision reveals “the dominance of a supremacist and racist mentality among American policymakers”. “This measure indicates the deep hostility of American decision-makers towards the Iranian and Muslim people,” he said in a statement. The latest restrictions cover nationals from Iran, Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. A limited ban has also been applied to travellers from seven other countries. Hashemi-Raja argued that the policy breaches international legal norms and denies millions the basic right to travel, based solely on nationality or faith. He said the ban would “entail international responsibility for the US government”, without elaborating. The US and Iran have had no formal diplomatic relations since 1980, following the Islamic Revolution. Despite decades of strained ties, the US remains home to the world’s largest Iranian diaspora, with about 1.5 million Iranians living there as of 2020, according to Tehran’s Foreign Ministry.",

    "title": "LA Olympics may be ‘good launching pad’ for NBA league in Europe",
    "article_text": "The NBA’s talks with the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) and other entities about the process of adding a new league in Europe are continuing, the game’s commissioner in the United States said. Adam Silver noted it may take at least a couple more years to turn the ideas into reality, pinpointing the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028 as a potential “launching pad” for another NBA competition. He was speaking on Friday – an off day forthe NBA Finals– at a league event to unveil a refurbished Boys & Girls Club in Oklahoma City and said it’s difficult to put a specific timeline on the Europe plans. “I will say it’s measured in years, not months,” Silver said. “So, we’re at least a couple years away from launching. “It would be an enormous undertaking. And while we want to move forward at a deliberate pace, we also want to make sure that we’re consulting with all the appropriate stakeholders, meaning the existing league, its teams, European players, media companies, marketing partners. There’s a lot of work to be done.” Silver and FIBA Secretary-General Andreas Zagklis announced in March that the league and the game’s governing body are finally taking long-awaited steps to form a new league, with an initial target of 16 teams. The idea had been talked about for years, even decades on some levels. Silver revealed that since the NBA and FIBA went public with their idea to move forward, talks have gotten more constructive. Silver said the NBA has been talking directly with the EuroLeague and with some member clubs about a partnership. It’s his preference that the NBA work with the existing league on some level, though it’s still too early to say exactly what that means. “Either way, we continue to feel there are an enormous number of underserved basketball fans in Europe and that there’s a strong opportunity to have another league styled after the NBA,” Silver said. About one in every six current NBA players hails from Europe, including Denver’s Nikola Jokic (Serbia) and Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo (Greece) – who have combined for five of the last seven MVP awards – along with the Los Angeles Lakers’ Luka Doncic (Slovenia) and San Antonio’s Victor Wembanyama (France). The NBA’s board of governors will talk more about next steps with the European plans in July, at their scheduled meeting in Las Vegas, Silver said. It’s possible that the European venture could be unveiled in some way – or possibly start – around the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, given how much attention will be on international basketball at that time. “That might be a good launching pad for an announcement around a new competition,” Silver said. Some of the cities that are expected to have interest in being part of the new venture include London, Manchester, Rome and Munich. There will be others, of course. “We haven’t had direct conversations yet,” Silver said. “But there have been several organisations that have come forward and said they would be interested and potential owners in operating in those major markets in Europe.”",

    "title": "Russia attacks Ukraine’s Kharkiv as prisoner swap hangs in balance",
    "article_text": "Russian forces have attacked the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv using drones, missiles and guided bombs, killing at least four people, in an attack a local official called “the most powerful attack” on the area since the start of the war. The series of attacks on Saturday came as an agreed exchange of prisoners of war appeared to hang in the balance with contradictory signals from Moscow and Kyiv. The Ukrainian Air Force said on Saturday that Russia struck with 215 missiles and drones overnight, and Ukrainian air defences shot down and neutralised 87 drones and seven missiles. At least three people were killed in the evening in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said, describing the assault as “the most powerful” on the city since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Later Saturday, Russia dropped aerial bombs on the city centre, killing another person and wounding five more, Kharkiv’s mayor said. The two attacks wounded more than 60 people, including children and a baby, local officials said. Terekhov said of the early hours initial attack that 48 Iranian-made drones, two missiles and four guided bombs were fired before dawn at the city of 1.4 million people, located just 50km (30 miles) from the Russian border. Kharkiv resident Alina Belous told The Associated Press news agency that she had tried to extinguish flames with buckets of water to rescue a young girl trapped inside a burning building who had called out for help. “We were trying to put it out ourselves with our buckets, together with our neighbours. Then the rescuers arrived and started helping us put out the fire, but there was smoke and they worried that we couldn’t stay there. When the ceiling started falling off, they took us out,” she said. Kharkiv was also hit by a Russian missile strike on Thursday that left 18 people injured, including four children. Elsewhere in the south, Russian shelling hit the city of Kherson, killing a couple and damaging residential buildings, regional Governor Oleksandr Prokudin confirmed. In Dnipro, two women, aged 45 and 88, were injured in separate attacks. Officials said that at least six people were killed and dozens were wounded on Friday when Russia launched an aerial bombardment across Ukraine. Rescue workers in the city of Lutsk on Saturday recovered another body, raising the toll from Friday’s attacks to seven. Moscow said Friday’s assault was carried out in response to Ukrainian “terrorist acts” against Russia, saying military sites were targeted. The surge in Russian attacksfollows an unprecedented Ukrainian drone operation last weekendthat damaged nuclear-capable military aircraft at Russian airbases deep behind the front lines, including in Siberia. Russian President Vladimir Putin pledged to retaliate for the attack, which Kyiv reportedly planned for 18 months using smuggled drones. The strike reportedly targeted Russian bombers as they were being prepared for operations against Ukraine. Ukraine, however, continues to push for a30-day ceasefireand presented its latest proposal during talks in Istanbul on Monday. But Moscow has rejected calls for an immediate truce, insisting the war is a matter of national survival. “For us, it is an existential issue,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Friday. “It concerns our national interest, our safety, and the future of our country.” Putin has demanded Ukraine withdraw from four partially occupied regions, abandon its NATO ambitions and halt all Western military cooperation – terms Kyiv has dismissed as unacceptable. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has instead called for a three-way summit involving himself, Putin and United States President Donald Trump. Later on Saturday, Ukraine rejected Russian claims that it delayed a planned exchange of prisoners and the return of soldiers’ remains, saying Moscow’s accusations were false and politically motivated. Kremlin adviser Vladimir Medinsky had alleged that Kyiv indefinitely postponed the process, despite a prior agreement reached during talks in Istanbul to repatriate 12,000 bodies and conduct further prisoner swaps. “The statements made today by the Russian side do not correspond to reality or previous agreements,” Ukraine’s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said in a Telegram post. It accused Moscow of “foul play” and deliberate “manipulation”.",

    "title": "At the Bitcoin Conference, the Republicans were for sale",
    "article_text": "How many Bitcoin does it take to solve all your political problems? How many Bitcoin does it take to solve all your political problems? byTina Nguyen “I want to make a big announcement,” said Faryar Shirzad, the chief policy officer of Coinbase, to a nearly empty room. His words echoed across the massive hall at the Bitcoin Conference, deep in the caverns of The Venetian Expo in Las Vegas, and it wasn’t apparent how many people were watching on the livestream. Then again, somebody out there may have been interested in the panelists he was interviewing, one of whom was unusual by Bitcoin Conference standards: Chris LaCivita, the political consultant who’d co-chaired Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign. “I am super proud to say it on this stage,” Shirzad continued, addressing the dozens of people scattered across 5,000 chairs. “We have just become a major sponsor of the America250 effort.” My jaw dropped. Coinbase, the world’s largest crypto exchange, the owner of 12 percent of the world’s Bitcoin supply, and listed on the S&P 500, was paying for Trump tohold a military parade. No wonder they made the announcement in an empty room. Today was “Code and Country”: an entire day of MAGA-themed panels on the Nakamoto Main Stage, full of Republican legislators, White House officials, and political operatives, all of whom praised Trump as the savior of the crypto world. But Code and Country was part of Industry Day, which was VIP only and closed to General Admission holders — the people with the $199 tickets, who flocked to the conference seeking wisdom from brilliant technologists and fabulously wealthy crypto moguls, who believed that decentralized currency on a blockchain could not be controlled by government authoritarians. They’d have drowned Shirzad in boos if they saw him give money to Donald Trump’s campaign manager, and they would have stormed the Nakamoto stage if they knew the purpose of America250. America250 is a nonprofit established by Congress during Barack Obama’s presidency with a mundane mission: to plan the nationwide festivities for July 4th, 2026, the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. “Who remembers the Bicentennial in 1976?” the co-chair, former U.S. Treasurer Rosie Rios, asked the crowd. “I remember it like it was yesterday, and this one is going to be bigger and better.” But then Trump got re-elected, appointed LaCivita as co-chair, and suddenly, the party was starting earlier. The week before the conference, America250announced that it would host a “Grand Military Parade”on June 14th to celebrate the U.S. Army’s 250th birthday, releasing tickets for prime seats along the parade route and near the Washington Monument on their website, hosting other festivities on the National Mall, and credentialing the press covering the event. (Their celebrations and events are a different operation from the U.S. Army, which had never planned for a parade to celebrate its 250th birthday, much less a military parade, but is now spendingup to $45 million in taxpayer dollars to make the parade happen.)According to the most recent statements from Army officials, the parade will include hundreds of cannons, dozens of Black Hawk and Chinook helicopters, fighter jets, bombers, and 150 military vehicles, including Bradley Fighting Vehicles, Stryker Fighting Vehicles, Humvees, and if the logistics work out, 25 (or more) M1 Abrams tanks. Trump had spent years trying to get the government to throw a military parade — primarily because he’d attended a Bastille Day parade in France andbecame jealous— and now that he was back in office, he’d finally eliminated everyone in the government who previously told him that the budget didn’t exist for such a parade, that the tank treads would ruin the streets and collapse the bridges, that the optics of tanks, guns and soldiers marching down Constitution Avenue were too authoritarian and fascist. June 14th also happens to be Donald Trump’s birthday. And Coinbase, whose CEO once told his employees tostop bringing politics into the workplace, was now footing the bill — if not for this military parade watch party, then for the one inevitably happening next year, when America actually turns 250, or any other festivities between now and then that may or may not fall on Trump’s birthday. (This wasn’t the first party they helped fund, though. Earlier this year, Coinbase wrote a $1 million check to Trump’s inauguration committee. One month later, the SEC announced that it was dropping an investigation into Coinbase.) I had to keep reminding myself that I was atthe Bitcoin Conference. I’d been desperately looking for the goofy, degenerate party vibes that my coworkers who’d covered previous crypto conferences told me about:inflated swanswith QR codes. Multimillionaires strolling around the Nakamoto Stage in Shiba Inu pajamas. Folks who communicated in memes and acronyms. Celebrity athletes who were actual celebrities.“Bitcoin yoga,”whatever that was. Afterparties with drugs, lots of drugs, and probably the mind-bending designer kind. And hey, Las Vegaswasthe global capital of goofy, degenerate partying. But no, I was stuck in a prolonged flashback to every single Republican event I’ve covered over the past ten years – Trump rallies, conservative conferences, GOP conventions, and MAGA fundraisers, with Lee Greenwood’s “God Bless the USA” playing on an endless loop. There was an emcee endlessly praising Trump, encouraging the audience to clap for Trump, and reminding everyone about how great it was that Trump spoke at the Conference last year, which all sounds even stranger when said in an Australian accent. In addition to LaCivita, there were four GOP Congressmen, four GOP Senators, one Trump-appointed SEC Commissioner, one Treasury Official, two senior White House officials (including David Sacks, the White House crypto and A.I. czar), and two of Trump’s sons. All of them, too, spent time praising Trump as the first “crypto president.” (Vice President J.D. Vance would be speaking the next day to the general admission crowd, but he was probably going to praise Trump, too.) The titles of the panels seemed to be run through some sort of MAGA generative AI system:The Next Golden Age of America. The American Super Grid. Making America the Global Bitcoin Superpower. The New Declaration of Independence: Bitcoin and the Path Out of the U.S. National Debt Crisis.(Speaker: Vivek Ramaswamy.)Uncancelable: Bitcoin, Rumble & Free Speech Technology.(Speaker: Donald Trump Jr.) The only difference was that this MAGA conference was funded by crypto. And if crypto was paying for a MAGA conference, and theyhadto play “God Bless the USA,” they were bringing in a string quartet. Annoyed that I had not yet seen a single Shiba Inu — no,Jim Justice’s celebrity bulldogwasnot the same thing— I left Nakamoto and went back to the press area. It hadn’t turned into Fox News yet, but I could see MAGA’s presence seeping into the world of podcasters and vloggers. A Newsmax reporter (great blowout, jewel-toned sheath dress, heels to the heavens, very camera-ready) was interviewing White House official Bo Hines (clean-cut, former Yale football player and GOP congressional candidate, nice suit), right before he was hustled onstage for a panel with a member of the U.S. Treasury. Soon, Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) was doing an interview gauntlet while his senior aides stood by, one wearing a pink plaid blazer that could have easily been Brooks Brothers. Over on the Genesis Stage, the CEO of PragerU, a right-wing media company that attacks higher education, was interviewing the CEO of the 1792 Exchange, a right-wing nonprofit that attacks companies for engaging in “woke business practices” such as diversity initiatives. (Leveraging Bitcoin’s Values to Shift the Culture in America.) I walked into the main expo center, past a crypto podcaster in a sequined bomber jacket talking to aWall Street Journalreporter. For some reason, his presence was a relief. Even though he was clearly a Trump supporter — his jacket said TRUMP: THE GOLDEN AGE on the back — there was something more janky and homegrown, less corporate, about him. But the moment I looked up and saw a massive sign that said STEAKTOSHI, the unease returned. A ghoulish-looking group of executives from Steak ‘n Shake, the fast food company with over 450 locations across the globe, had gathered under the sign in a replica of the restaurant. They were selling jars of beef tallow, with a choice of grass-fed or Wagyu, and giving out a MAKE FRYING OIL TALLOW AGAIN hat with every purchase, an overt embrace of the right-wing conspiracy that cooking with regular seed oils would lower one’s testosterone. (Relevant to the conference: they were also advertising that their restaurants now accepted Bitcoin.) Andrew Gordon, the head of Main Street Crypto PAC, had been to five previous Bitcoin Conferences and worked on crypto tax policy since 2014. He’d seen Trump speak at the last conference in Nashville during the election, and the audience – not typically unquestioning MAGA superfans – had melted into adoring goo in Trump’s presence. But now that Trump was using his presidential powers to establish a Bitcoin reserve, roll back federal investigations into crypto companies, and order massive changes to financial regulatory policies — in short, changing the entire market on crypto’s behalf with the stroke of a pen — Gordon clocked a notable vibe shift this year. “There are people wearing suits at a Bitcoin conference,” he told me wryly back in the press lounge. (He, too, was wearing a suit.) The change wasn’t due to a new breed of Suit People flooding in. It was the Bitcoin veterans, the ones who’d been coming to the conference for years, dressed in loud Versace jackets or old holey t-shirts – who were now in business attire. “They’re now recognizing the level of formality and how serious it is.” According to the Bitcoin Conference organizers, out of the 35,000-plus attendees in Vegas this year, 17.1 percent of them were categorized as “institutional and corporate decision-makers” — a vague way to describe politicians, corporate executives, and the rest of the C-suite world. Whenever they weren’t speaking onstage, they were conducting interviews with outlets hand-selected from dozens of media requests that had been filtered through the conference organizers, or in Q&A sessions with people who’d bought the $21,000 Whale Pass and could access the VIP Lounge. (Yes, the industry-only day of the conference had an even more exclusive tier.) They were sidebarring with crypto CEOs outside the conference for round tables, privately meeting Senators for lunch, and White House officials for dinner. Gordon himself had just held a private breakfast for industry insiders, with GOP Senators Marsha Blackburn and Cynthia Lummis as special guests. And for the very,verywealthy, MAGA Inc., Trump’s primary super PAC, was holding a fundraising dinner in Vegas that night, with Vance, Don Jr., and Eric Trump in attendance. That ticket, according toThe Washington Post, cost$1 million per person. It was the kind of amoral, backroom behavior that would have sent the General Admission attendees into a rage — and they did the next day, when the convention opened to them. During one extremely packed talk at the Genesis Stage calledAre Bitcoiners Becoming Sycophants of the State?,a moderator asked the four panelists what they’d like to say to Vance and Sacks and all the politicians who’d been there yesterday. And Erik Cason erupted. “‘What you’re doing is actually immoral and bad. You hurt people. You actively want to use the state to implement violence against others.’  That’s like, fucked up and wrong,” said Cason, the author of “Cryptosovereignty,” to a crowd of hundreds. “If you personally wanna like, go to Yemen and try to stab those people, that’s on you. But asking other people to go do that – it is a fucked up and terrible thing.” He grew more heated. “And also fuck you. You’re not, like, a king. You’re supposed to be liable to the law, too.  And I don’t appreciate you trying to think that that you just get to advance the state however the fuck you want, because you have power.” “These are the violent thugs who killed hundreds of millions of people over the last century,” agreed Bruce Fenton of Chainstone Labs. “They have nothing on us. All we wanna do is run some code and trade it around our nerd money. Leave us alone.” The audience burst into cheers and applause. Bitcoin was the promise of freedom from the government, who’d murdered and stolen and tried to control their lives, and now that their wealth was on the blockchain, no one could take their sovereignty. “Personally, I don’t really care what they [the politicians] think,” said American HODL, whose title on the conference site was “guy with 6.15 bitcoin,” the derision clear in his voice. “They are employees who work for us, so their thoughts and opinions on the matter are irrelevant. Do what the fuck we tell you to do.  I don’t work for you. I’m not underneath you. You’re underneath me.” But the politicians weren’t going to listen to them, much less talk to them. The politicians spent the conference surrounded by aides and security who stopped people from approaching –I’m sorry, the Senator has to leave for an engagement now –or safely inside the VIP rooms with the $21,000-dollar Whale Pass holders and the million-dollar donors. By the time American HODL said that the politicians worked for him, they were on flights out of Vegas, having gotten what they wanted from Code and Country, an event that was closed to General Admission pass holders. Coinbase’s executiveswereat Code and Country, however. Coinbase held over 984,000 Bitcoin, more coins than American HODL could mine in a lifetime. And Coinbase was now a sponsor of Donald Trump’s birthday military parade. After David Sacks and the Winklevoss twins finished explaining how Trump had saved the crypto industry from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (or as one Winklevoss called her,“Pocahontas”), I was jonesing for a drink. A few other reporters on the ground had told me about “Code, Country and Cocktails,” the America250 afterparty held at the Ayu Dayclub at Resort World, and I signed up immediately. Reporters at past Bitcoin Conferences had promised legendary side-event depravity, and I hoped I would find it there. As I entered the lush, tropical nightclub, I saw two white-gloved hands sticking out of the side of the wall, each holding a glass of champagne at crotch level. I reached out for a flute, thinking it wasmaybejust a fucked-up piece of art, and gasped as the hand let go of the stem, disappeared into the hole, and emerged seconds later with another full champagne glass. Past the champagne glory hole wall — there was really no other way to describe it — was a massive outdoor swimming pool, surrounded by chefs serving up endless portions of steak frites, unguarded magnums of Moët casually stacked in ice buckets, the professional Beautiful Women of Las Vegas draped around Peter Schiff, the famous economist/podcaster/Bitcoin skeptic. When not booked for private events, the crescent-shaped pool at Ayu would be filled with drunk people in swimsuits, dancing to DJ Kaskade. No one was in the pool tonight. Depravity was not happening here. In fact, there was more networking going on than partying, and it was somehow more engaging than Bone Thugs-N-Harmony suddenly appearing onstage to perform. And it was distinctlynotjust about making money in crypto. A good percentage of this crowd wore some derivative of a MAGA hat, and anyone who could show off their photos of themselves with Trump did so. This, I realized, was how crypto bros did politics — a new game for them, where success and influence were not necessarily quantifiable. “Crypto got Trump elected,” Greg Grseziak, an agent who manages crypto influencers, told me, showing me his Trump photo opp. “In four years, this is going to be the biggest event in the presidential race.” Grzesiak walked off to do more networking, I finished my glory hole champagne, and in the meantime, Bone Thugs had started performing “East 1999”. A fellow reporter leaned over. “Who do you think those guys are?” he asked, pointing to a group of extremely tall white men in suits and lanyards, standing behind a velvet rope to the left of the stage. I walked over to investigate. They looked like the group of Steak ‘n Shake executives I met at the Expo Hall — the ones with the beef tallow jars and derivative MAGA hats — and they were lurking next to the stage, watching the rappers like vultures but barely moving to the music. This scene was too preposterous to actually be real: Steak ‘n Shake executives, at the Bitcoin Conference, attending a party for America250, in the VIP section, during a Bone Thugs-n-Harmony set? “Shout out to Steak ‘n Shake for being the first fast food restaurant to accept Bitcoin!” announced one of the Bones. The company logo appeared on a screen above his head. No flashy Vegas magic (or dancers in cow costumes, now shimmying onstage with Steak ‘n Shake signs) could mask what I just saw. This party was co-sponsored by a MAGA-branded fast-food chain owned by Sardar Biglari, a businessman who had purchasedMaxim, became its editor-in-chief, and used the smutty magazine to endorse Trump in 2024. So was Frax, the stablecoin exchange, and Exodus, one of the biggest crypto wallet companies in the market. Bitcoin Magazine’s logo flashed across the stage at one point, as editor-in-chief David Bailey, in his own derivative MAGA hat, tried to hype up the crowd for J.D. Vance’s speech the next day. (“You only get to live history once,” he said, to faint cheers.) For some unknown reason, these companies were all putting their money into America250, and as I had to keep reminding myself, America250 — the government nonprofit in charge of planning the country’s celebrations of the 250th anniversary of the Declaration’s signing — was currently working to get tanks in the streets of Washington DC for Donald Trump’s birthday. I went for one last champagne flute from the glory hole, just for the novelty, and as the hand disappeared back into the wall, I caught something I’d missed earlier: above the hole was a logo for TRON, the blockchain exchange run by billionaire Justin Sun. He had faced several fraud investigations from the SEC that magically disappeared after he invested $75 million in a Trump family crypto company, and seemed more than happy to keep throwing crypto money at Trump. Recently, he won the $TRUMP meme coin dinner, spending over $16 million on the token in exchange for a private and controversial dinner with the president. TRON was also cosponsoring the America250 party. Earlier, I’d run into the Australian emcee in the elevator of The Palazzo. She’d spent the day teetering across the Nakamoto Stage in dainty kitten heels, a pinstriped blazer and miniskirt suit set, and given the gratuitous Trump praising and the fact she was blonde, I had stereotyped her as MAGA to the core. But the program was over and she was holding her heels by their ankle straps, barefoot and sighing in relief. This was not her usual style, she told an attendee. She’d take a pair of sneakers over heels if she could. But the conference organizers had told her to dress up because there were senators in attendance. “Tomorrow, the real Bitcoiners are coming,” she said, and she’d get to wear flat shoes. And the next morning, on the day of Vance’s speech, I found myself stuck outside the conference with the “real Bitcoiners.” In spite of all the emails that the conference had sent me reminding me of how strict security measures would be, possibly to overcorrect from last year’s utter shitshow around Trump’s appearance, I’d woken up too late, eaten my bagel too leisurely, got sidetracked by a police officer-turned-Bitcoin investor excited I was wearing orange (whoops), and barely missed the cutoff for the Secret Service to let me in. But the conference had set up televisions with a live feed of Vance’s speech, and the rest of the general admission attendees were remarkably chill about it, opting to mingle in the hallways until the Secret Service left. I found myself in a smaller crowd near the expo hall door, next to a young man carrying a live miniature Shiba Inu (“It’s a tiny doge!” he said proudly), and the podcaster I’d seen earlier in the sequined bomber jacket. He introduced himself as Action CEO, and with nothing else to do but wait — “You can watch the [Vance] replay,” he reassured me, “these events are mainly about networking” — we got to talking. “I’m actually excited that Trump isn’t even here, I’ll be honest with you,” he said, speaking with a rapid cadence. Trump was ultimately just one guy, and the fact that he sent his underlings and political allies — the ones who could actually implement his grand promises for the crypto industry — proved he hadn’t just been paying lip service. That said, it had come with some uncomfortable changes, including the re-emergence of Justin Sun. “It’s a little bit concerning when you say,All right, we don’t care what you did in the past. Come on out, clean slate,”he continued. “That’s the concern right now for most people. Seeing people that did wrong by the space coming back and acting like nothing happened? That’s a little concerning.” And not just that: Sun was back in the United States, having dinner with Trump, and giving him millions of dollars. “If you’re sitting in a room and having a conversation, people are literally gonna go,yeah, it’s kind of sketch that this guy is back here after everything that’s happened.You’re not gonna see it published, because it’s not a popular opinion, but we’re all definitely talking about it.” If Action’s friends weren’t comfortable talking about it openly, that fraudsters with enough money were suddenly back in the mix, it was certainly not the kind of conversation the CEOs were going to have in front of the General Admission crowd. (Though it did mean that the emcee, looking much happier than she did the day before, got to wear low-heeled boots and shorts.) But behind closed doors — or at least at the Code and Country panels, where the base pass attendees couldn’t boo them — they gave a sense of what their backroom conversations with the Trump administrationdidlook like. “I was actually at a dinner last night and one of the things that someone from the admin said was,What if we give you guys everything you want and then you guys forget?Because there’s midterms in 2026, and hopefully 2028, and beyond,” said Sam Kazemian, the founder and CEO of Frax, which had sponsored the America250 party. “But one of the things I said was: We as an industry are very, very loyal. The crypto community has a very, very, very strong memory. And once this industry is legalized, is transparent, is safe, all of the big players understand that this wasn’t possible without this administration, this Congress, this Senate. We’re lifelong, career-long allies.” “Loyalty” is a dangerous concept with this president, who’s cheated on his three wives, stopped paying the legal fees foremployees who’d taken the fall for him, ended the careers of sympathetic MAGA Republicans for insufficiently coddling him, withdrew security for government employees experiencing death threatsfor the sin of contradicting him in publicby citing facts. It was only weeks ago that he and Vance were publicly screaming at Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, who was at the White House to request more aid in the war against Russia, for not saying “thank you” in front of the cameras. It would be less than a week beforehe began threatening to cancel all of Elon Musk’s government contractswhen the billionaire criticized the size of Trump’s budget, even though Musk had given him millions and helped himpurge the government. And if you were to find a photo of any political leader, billionaire, or CEO standing vacant-eyed next to Trump and shaking his hand, the circumstances are practically a given: they had recently made him unhappy, either for criticizing him, making an imagined slight, or simply asserting themselves. The only way they could avoid public humiliation, or their businesses being crushed via executive order, was to go to Mar-a-Lago, tell the world that the president was wonderful, and underwrite a giant party for his birthday military parade. Maybe Kazemian knew he was being tested, or maybe the 32-year-old Ron Paul superfan had no idea what the administration was asking of him. Either way, he responded correctly. At least one person at the conference was thinking about ways that the government could betray the Bitcoin community. As the panel on Bitcoiners becoming sycophants of the state wrapped up, and the other panelists finished telling the government pigs to go fuck themselves and keep their hands off their nerd money, the moderator turned to Casey Rodarmor, a software engineer-turned-crypto influencer, for the last question: “Tell everyone here why Bitcoin wins, regardless of what happens.” “Oh, man, I don’tknowif Bitcoin wins, regardless of what happens,” he responded, frowning. He had already gamed out one feasible situation where Bitcoin lost: “If we all of a sudden saw a very rapid inflation in a lot of fiat currencies, and there was a plausible scapegoat in Bitcoin all over the world, and they were able to make a sort of marketing claim that Bitcoin is causing this —Bitcoin is making your savings go to zero, it’s causing this carnage to the economy—  If that happens worldwide, I think that’s really scary.” The moderator froze, the crowd murmured nervously, and I thought about the number of times Trump had blamed a group of people for problems they’d never caused.An awful lot of them were now being deported.“I take that seriously,” Rodarmor continued. “I don’tknowthat Bitcoin will succeed. I think that Bitcoin is incredibly strong, it’s incredibly difficult to fuck up. But in that case… man, I don’t know.” I had asked Action CEO earlier if Kazemian, the Frax CEO, was right — if the crypto world was unquestioningly loyal to Trump, if their support of him was unconditional. “Oh, it’s definitely conditional,” he said without hesitation, as his Trump jacket glittered under the fluorescent lights. “It’s a matter of, are you going to be doing the right things by us, by the people who are here?” We walked down the expo hall, past booths promising life-changing technological marvels, alongside thousands of people flooding into Nakamoto Hall, ready to learn how to become unfathomably rich, who paid $199 to be there.

From managing your own vending machine empire to chilling around a campfire. byAndrew Webster If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. The Wholesome Direct isalways full of cute and charming games to keep an eye on for the future. But it’s also a great place to find things to play now — and that’s especially true this year. The 2025 edition of the livestream showcase included a number of games that released during the show itself. So if you like what you see, there’s no wait at all. Finally, a game that combines designing your own house with going on a road trip.Camper Van: Make it Homeis exactly what it sounds like. On the design side, you’re able to customize a tiny home camper and make it appropriately cozy, but the developers say it will also take you on “a journey of self-discovery.” This game seems designed entirely around comfort. You play as a cute little animal and spend your time curled up around a fire, chatting with friends, and guiding the conversation as you get pulled into a bigger story. Puzzle game meets scrapbooking. Here the goal is to organize a huge cache of family photos, and as you do, discover their history and story. “Inspired by the way elders pass down family history using pictures to support their storytelling,” the developers explain, “this game blends narrative, puzzle, and creativity.” This game is almost worth checking out for the pun title alone. In it, you create all kinds of weird omelets on a conveyor belt to deliver to students with seemingly very weird taste buds. Also, the principal is a rooster. From the same team behind the similarly gothicA Mortician’s Tale, this game has players exploring a chill cemetery that changes based on the time of day and season. It even has sound effects recorded from an IRL cemetery. And not only is out today, it’s a completely free download. For those who wish Picross also had lots of adorable little mice. In addition to all of the number-based puzzle solving,Squeakrossalso has some collecting elements, where you can gather decorations and stickers to up the cozy factor. This hand-drawn adventure game looks absolutely stunning, like an animated movie come to life, and it stars a little guy who can change shape to explore the natural world in various contexts. While the whole experience isn’t available yet, you can play the game’s first episode now. This game may give you a craving for Boss Coffee, but it also looks pretty laid-back. It’s described as a “charming idle simulation game,” and the goal is to build an empire of vending machines, where you’ll have to manage staff and handle decorations.

Father’s Day rules. It’s a day to celebrate all that dads have contributed to the people, homes, and communities that they’re a part of. Being a dad is a lot of work — something I can vouch for, being a relatively new one myself — so for Father’s Day, why not give dear old dad a token of appreciation and love? Whether your dad prefers practical or clever gifts, we think you’ll be pleased with the selection of picks below. As usual, we lean pretty heavily on tech, but there are several non-tech suggestions that most dads will be happy to receive, all of which come courtesy of the thoughtful staff here atTheVerge. If afast-charging portable batteryorSony’s collapsible WH-1000XM6 headphoneswon’t do the trick, perhaps Kurt Vonnegut’s recently discoveredtwo-player board gameor a mountableLego van Gogh replicawill? For some people, note-taking is serious, serious business. That’s why your dad’s great ideas, errant thoughts, to-do lists, and appointments deserve a worthy notebook. Traveler’s leather-bound travel journals are great for jotting down all of the above, especially since they come in a slew of sizes. Whether your dad is a fan of theIndiana Jonesflicks or he digs MachineGames’ excellentWolfensteintitles, there’s plenty to like inThe Great Circle. The first-person exploration game lets you crack the whip, punch Nazis, and traverse the globe to retrieve precious relics. It’s good fun. There are plenty of portable batteries out there, but few are as versatile and powerful as Anker’s 25,000mAh Laptop Power Bank. The handy pack features two built-in, retractable USB-C cables — one of which serves as a lanyard — allowing you to quickly charge most devices on the go. The best mobile controller is the Backbone Pro. It retains the same overall design and feel as the company’s cheaper model, only with some comfort-boosting improvements. It also features a built-in battery and Bluetooth support, so your dad can use it for gaming on his TV, computer, VR headset, or handheld PC. The more ways you know how to diagnose a possible issue with your car, the less time you’ll spend at the mechanic (sorry, mechanics). Ancel’s diagnostic scanner plugs into the OBD2 port found in most US cars dating back to ’96, letting you see exactly why certain lights on your dash keep popping up. The latest iteration of Sony’s best-in-class noise-canceling headphones has finally arrived. The newfangled XM6 make subtle improvements to every facet, from sound quality to comfort to ANC, while wisely bringing back the foldable design last seen on the last-gen XM4. Hoto’s modus operandi is to make svelte, handsome tools, with the SnapBloq being its sleekest yet. Buying all three sets — which, as the name implies, snap together to form a block — nets you a precision screwdriver, drill pen, and rotary tool, all of which are rechargeable. Dad may already own enough tools, but we bet they don’t look nearly as good as these do. Satechi’s MagSafe-ready wallet addresses two specific needs that may make it a must-have for some dads: it’s crafted from vegan leather, and it doubles as a kickstand. That means the durable wallet provides a hands-free way to watch videos or hop on a call, whether you place it in portrait or landscape mode. Most of Apple’s high-end earbud tech can be found in the AirPods 4, which cost significantly less than the latest Pro model. They’re relatively small, offer great sound, and even support USB-C charging, making them a great pick if you can do without active noise cancellation. Percival Everett’s first work of fiction earned him the Pulitzer this year — and it’s no surprise. The bold 2024 tale serves as a reworking of Huck Finn as told by the enslaved man who travels with him down the Mississippi, and although it’s dead serious at times due to the subject matter, it’s also inventive, poetic, and surprisingly funny. Xiaomi doesn’t have as much of a presence in the US as it does globally, but thankfully, the classy Sound Pocket is readily available. The compact Bluetooth speaker supports hands-free calling with its built-in microphone, and its IP67 rating means it can even handle some water — so long as you don’t submerge it fortoolong. While writingCat’s Cradle, Kurt Vonnegut needed to pay the bills, so he tried his hand at making board games. His creation, a tactical war-themed tabletop game calledGHQ(General Headquarters), never saw the light of day — that is, until recently. Needless to say, the two-player game is a great title for Vonnegut fans and scholars alike. The Forerunner 570 has no business looking as good as it does for a running watch. Garmin’s new wearable features a bright OLED display, a slick translucent band, and several new features, including skin temperature sensors and a built-in speaker / mic. The only real question is what size to get for dear ol’ dad: 42mm or 47mm? Magic: The Gatheringisn’t as difficult to get into as you might think, and theFinal Fantasy-themed expansion might be the perfect place to start. The upcoming collection has sent the internet into a proverbial spiral, with many products selling out as a result of averydedicated fan base. Lucky for dad, the entry-level starter kit is still readily available. All of dad’s precious tech is prone to dust and other debris, which can impact usability if left unchecked. Fortunately, with Nitecore’s rechargeable air blower as a companion, he can easily rid his mechanical keyboards and other tough-to-reach crannies of unwanted grime, ensuring all of his gadgets are in tip-top shape. Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon has come a long way from the fabled Wisconsin cabin where he supposedly holed up to record his debut.Sable, Fable, his latest LP, is a welcome kaleidoscope of sounds and feelings, from familiar strummers and beat-heavy ballads to the kind of sultry, R&B-flecked tracks that would make Prince swoon. Telepathic Instruments’ retrofuturist keyboard is a vibes machine, one designed for people who want to easily produce cool sounds. It only houses a few piano keys, but it has dedicated major, minor, and other inputs that let you get creative without necessarily having to know how to play. You can effortlessly replicate the magic of making s’mores while camping with Chef’n’s small, safe machine. The contained flame on the tidy indoor / outdoor roaster is built to toast marshmallows, while its ceramic dome can melt chocolate onto graham crackers. All you’ll need to supply is a fuel can, plus all the s’mores ingredients you can muster. Like all of us, your dad deserves to watch movies at the best possible resolution, which is where a 4K Blu-ray player comes in. Panasonic makes some of the best models you can buy, and when paired with the right TV, 4K Blu-rays look and sound better than even the most high-res streaming apps. Plus, it’s still fun to collect discs. If your dad’s shaving gadget repertoire is outdated, try treating him to a fantastic — and customizable — beard trimmer. Panasonic’s washable, wide-tipped model comes with 19 adjustable settings and can cut hair, too, just in case dad wants to keep a short ’do or touch up his sideburns. Most modern gadgets are rechargeable via USB-C, but many households still rely on traditional batteries for all sorts of things. Your dad is sure to be impressed with your moxie when you gift him this deluxe battery organizer, which has dedicated compartments for coin cell batteries, large D-cell batteries, and all of the smaller sizes in between. Most people don’t want to wrangle cables… and who can blame them? Not us, which is why several folks atThe Vergeown Baseus’ handy, retractable USB-C option. The Free2Pull comes in two sizes, each of which conveniently pulls the excess cable into a small puck that’s far tidier and easier to manage than a loose cord. Looking at birds is cool, and we’re all better off spending more time doing it. And while birdwatching typically requires patience and a decent pair of binoculars, you could summon birds with Birdfy’s entry-level smart feeder, which features a 1080p camera and an app that lets you view birds up close as they munch on seeds. The Xreal One aren’t the most affordable augmented-reality glasses available, but they are some of the best for displaying movies and games on the go. You can connect them via USB-C to your smartphone, tablet, or handheld gaming PC, making the 84-gram spectacles the ultimate upgrade for both plane flights and your commute. Think you and your old man are on the same wavelength? CMYK’s outstanding board game is one way to find out. The simple premise has you guessing where your partner thinks a specific word or topic fits between two diametric ends of a spectrum, which, believe it or not, can be incredibly difficult depending on how well you know your teammate. Your dad might have been able to inflate your water wings as a kid, but I doubt he could do the same for the tires on his CR-V. Fortunately, Fanttik’s compact tire inflator comes with enough nozzles and packs enough power to fill pretty much anything. It even has a built-in LCD display that lets you set your desired PSI, so he never has to worry about overinflating. The Switch 2 could make for a stellar gift for any dad — that is, if you can manage to preorder one ahead of the console’s arrival on June 5th. Nintendo’s latest hybrid console packs a larger 7.9-inch 1080p display, magnetic Joy-Con controllers, and a host of other minor but welcome improvements that build upon what was already a winning formula. Most Lego creations occupy some desk or table space, which can be annoying if you’re trying to tidy up. However, every item from Lego’s Vincent van Gogh collection, which consists of several brick-ified paintings from the artist’s late-1800s heyday, can be assembled and then mounted to your wall. Unless you’re filming cinematic shots in Hollywood, you don’t necessarily need a fancy quadcopter. HoverAir’s so-called “selfie drone” is a great budget alternative to more premium models from DJI, with top-mounted controls, excellent object tracking, and a max video resolution of 2.7K / 30fps. And did we mention it can fit in your pocket? Because it can. A basic timer may seem like a thoughtless gift, but there are many tasks we procrastinate on every day that could be more easily managed if we dedicated a little bit of time to them. A visual Pomodoro timer, such as the colorful MOD (Home Edition), is key to helping break tasks into manageable chunks or take them on all at once. With the Aeropress Coffee Maker, your dad will be able to enjoy their morning cup of joe no matter where he is. Not only does the portable coffee press pack into its own plastic cup and showcase a shatterproof see-through build, but it can make up to three cups of coffee at once, meaning he can enjoy a refill when that mid-day slump inevitably hits. A massage gun is a gift that keeps on giving. When muscles and tendons are tight or sore, the Theragun Mini serves as a quick and easy remedy, allowing dad to get on with his day with less discomfort. The third-gen model is just a little smaller, making what was already an ultra-portable device even more compact. Updated, June 7th:Adjusted pricing / availability and added several new picks, including HoverAir’s X1 drone. Brandon Widder also contributed to this post. 9 Verge Score ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

    "title": "The soul of The Last of Us is in Gustavo Santaolalla&#8217;s music",
    "article_text": "The composer talks about working on the games and the show, as well as the importance of silence. The composer talks about working on the games and the show, as well as the importance of silence. byTom Regan When fans nervously tuned in to watchHBO’s adaptation of one of their favorite video games, there was one familiar presence that immediately calmed their nerves: the mournful guitar of Gustavo Santaolalla. As certain story beats changed and beloved polygonal faces were replaced with new actors, the beating heart ofThe Last of Us— its mesmerizing, tension-ridden score — survived the transition to TV intact. “[Series creator] Neil Druckmann has said that my music is part of the DNA ofThe Last of Us,“ Santaolalla says. “I think the fact that we kept the sonic fabric — that we didn’t do an orchestral score for the series — has been instrumental in keeping those fans of the games fans of the series, too.” Born and raised in Buenos Aires, Santaolalla first started releasing music when he was 17. Loving both English rock bands and the traditional Argentine folk music that he was raised on, Santaolalla melded both into his own unique sound, part of a genre called rock nacional. Before he could fully make his mark, Santaolalla’s family fled the Argentine junta dictatorship in 1978, moving to Los Angeles, where his unique sound soon caught the attention of filmmakers. Snapped up to score the 2000 filmAmores Perrosand 2003’s21 Grams,their success led to Santaolalla composing the soundtracks forBrokeback MountainandBabel, both of which won him Oscars. Santaolla’s sonic secret? Embracing the eloquence of silence. “I work so much with silence and space, because silences sometimes can be louder than a note that you’re playing,” says Santaolalla. “I remember onBrokeback Mountainwhen I first sent them the music, the producer said ‘I thought you were pulling my leg at first, because you wait so long to play the next note!’” “Silences sometimes can be louder than a note that you’re playing.” After winning two Oscars back to back, Santaolalla carefully considered his next career move. Despite being a self-professed “terrible gamer” Santaolalla tells me he always loved watching his son play, mesmerized by the on-screen kineticism. “I always thought that if somebody connects this at an emotional level with a player, it’s going to be a revolution.” It turns out, the universe had picked up on Santaolalla’s newest interest. Post-Oscars, he was approached by several game companies to do music, but turned them down because “I’m very picky about the work that I do.” That includes a lucrative gaming project that he is careful not to name. “Everyone thought I was crazy!” he chuckles. Still, Santaolalla quietly hoped that a more emotionally-resonant project would materialize. “So, I waited… and then Neil appeared,” Santaolalla says. “When Neil told his colleagues that he wanted me to do this, [his colleagues ] said, No, Gustavo is not going to be interested — he won two Oscars! But when Neil [told me] the story, and that he wanted to do a game that connects with people on an emotional level… I was sold. What even Neil Druckmann wasn’t prepared for, however, was that Gustavo’s music would become just as crucial a presence as Ellie and Joel. In a post apocalyptic world where life is scarce and danger lurks around every corner, silence hangs in the air like a threat. Santaolalla’s scuffed notes, discordant melodies and screeching fret slides reverberate across the dilapidated city streets, feeling as unpredictable as the world Ellie and Joel inhabit. “I love the use of imperfections, even errors or mistakes.” “I love the use of imperfections, even errors or mistakes,” Santaolalla explains. “Any professional guitar player when they’re recording tend to avoid all kinds of noises; when you run your hand on the fretboard or little glitches in your playing. But sometimes, I’ll push those in my mix, and I think that humanizes it. That’s why many people have said that my music becomes like a character — a presence. It’s why I play things myself.” Inthe second game, Gustavo’s music becomes a physical part of the fiction, withEllie carrying a guitar throughout her quest for vengeance. She takes out the instrument during welcome moments of downtime, offering cathartic respite. And just like Gustavo’s score, these beautiful vignettes break up the harrowing silence,which carries through in the second season of the show. “I love the TV series too,” says Santaolalla. “ For the show, Neil associated himself with another incredible talent, Craig Mazin — the guy that didChernobyl— who knows that media and that language. I think it was a big, big challenge, because when you go from one media to another one, people say no, I like the original better! So, I think, once again, that the way we have used the music has been instrumental to keep that fan base attached.” He adds that “I think that when a story is really great, like a theatrical piece — like Shakespeare — it doesn’t matter who plays the character. Obviously Pedro Pascal’s Joel is different than the Joel from the game, but the substance of the character is so powerful that those things are just superficial. They could have done this as a series, as a feature film, as a puppet theatre piece, or an animation and it will still land regardless — because it’s just great writing.” Now as Santaolalla finds himself releasing his very own instrument — the Guitarocko — it feels like the culmination of the musical journey he started as a teen. Melding the traditional Bolivian 10 stringed ronroco with the form factor of a Fender Stratocaster, Gustavo feels a father-like pride for his musical creation: the 73-year-old is invigorated by whatThe Last Of Ushas given him at this stage in his career. “I’ve been blessed with the fact that I have connected with an audience since I was very young,” he says. “But the way I connect with the fans ofThe Last of Usand the way they connect with the music… here’s a special devotion that is really beautiful. I have this new audience which is fantastic, and I love that they didn’t know me as an artist or as a film composer! Now they look for my music, and they discover these things. It’s been a gift for me, at this point — after everything that I’ve been through — to be involved with a project like this.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

Plus, you can save on Meta’s excellent Quest 3S headset and a dirt-cheap location tracker. byBrandon Widder If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. This year’s WWDCkicks off in less than a week, which means Apple is likely to announce a string of software changes in short order,some of whichare designed to improve Apple’s latest pair of premium earbuds. Thankfully, if you haven’t yet pulled the trigger on the second-genAirPods Pro, they’re once again on sale atAmazon,Walmart, andBest Buyfor around $169 ($70 off), matching their best price of the year. The second-gen AirPods Pro improve upon Apple’s original pair with much better noise cancellation, sound quality, and onboard volume controls. The latest refresh also ships with a USB-C charging case, as opposed to Lightning. If you’re an iPhone user, you’d be hard-pressed to find a better pair of noise-canceling earbuds than Apple’s latest AirPods Pro with USB-C. The second-gen model ratchets up the noise cancellation and sound quality, providing dynamic, rich sound and ANC that can go toe-to-toe withSony’s XM5and other like-minded rivals. Unlike the cheaperAirPods 4 with ANC, they also feature convenient swipe-based controls and four sets of silicone tips, whereas Apple’s entry-level earbuds still rely on an open-style design that allows more ambient noise in. As for why they’re the perfect fit for iPhone users, well, that’s easy. The Pro are chock-full of Apple-only features, including head tracking spatial audio, robust Find My support, and automatic device switching. The included speaker-equipped charging case also features a U1 chip for more accurate tracking, and thanks toa software update in the fall, Apple’s high-end earbuds can now protect your hearing and serve as clinical-grade hearing aids. That makes them well-suited for those with mild to moderate hearing loss — or your next Turnstile concert. Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.

    "title": "A ban on state AI laws could smash Big Tech&#8217;s legal guardrails",
    "article_text": "﻿A new Senate version would condition broadband infrastructure funding on states’ hands-off approach to AI. ﻿A new Senate version would condition broadband infrastructure funding on states’ hands-off approach to AI. byLauren Feiner Senate Commerce Republicans have kept a ten year moratorium on state AI laws intheir latest version ofPresident Donald Trump’s massive budget package. And a growing number of lawmakers and civil society groups warn that its broad language could put consumer protections on the chopping block. Republicans who support the provision, which the House cleared as part of its “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” say it will help ensure AI companies aren’t bogged down by a complicated patchwork of regulations. But opponents warn that should it survive a vote and a congressional rule that might prohibit it, Big Tech companies could be exempted from state legal guardrails for years to come, without any promise of federal standards to take their place. “What this moratorium does is prevent every state in the country from having basic regulations to protect workers and to protect consumers,” Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), whose district includes Silicon Valley, tellsThe Vergein an interview. He warns that as written, the language included in the House-passed budget reconciliation package could restrict state laws that attempt to regulate social media companies, prevent algorithmic rent discrimination, or limit AI deepfakes that could mislead consumers and voters. “It would basically give a free rein to corporations to develop AI in any way they wanted, and to develop automatic decision making without protecting consumers, workers, and kids.” “One thing that is pretty certain … is that it goes further than AI” The bounds of what the moratorium could cover are unclear — and opponents say that’s the point. “The ban’s language on automated decision making is so broad that we really can’t be 100 percent certain which state laws it could touch,” says Jonathan Walter, senior policy advisor at the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. “But one thing that is pretty certain, and feels like there is at least some consensus on, is that it goes further than AI.” That could include accuracy standards and independent testing required for facial recognition models in states like Colorado and Washington, he says, as well as aspects of broad data privacy bills across several states. Ananalysis by nonprofit AI advocacy groupAmericans for Responsible Innovation (ARI) found that a social media-focused law like New York’s “Stop Addictive Feeds Exploitation for Kids Act” could be unintentionally voided by the provision. Center for Democracy and Technology state engagement director Travis Hall says in a statement that the House text would block “basic consumer protection laws from applying to AI systems.” Even state governments’ restrictions on their own use of AI could be blocked. The new Senate language adds its own set of wrinkles. The provision is no longer a straightforward ban, but it conditions state broadband infrastructure funds on adhering to the familiar 10-year moratorium. Unlike the House version, the Senate version would also cover criminal state laws. Supporters of the AI moratorium argue it wouldn’t apply to as many laws as critics claim, but Public Citizen Big Tech accountability advocate J.B. Branch says that “any Big Tech attorney who’s worth their salt is going to make the argument that it does apply, that that’s the way that it was intended to be written.” Khanna says that some of his colleagues may not have fully realized the rule’s scope. “I don’t think they have thought through how broad the moratorium is and how much it would hamper the ability to protect consumers, kids, against automation,” he says. In the days since it passed through the House,even Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), a staunch Trump ally, said she would have voted against the OBBB had she realized the AI moratorium was included in the massive package of text. California’s SB 1047 is the poster child for what industry players dub overzealous state legislation. The bill, which intended to place safety guardrails on large AI models, wasvetoed by Democratic Governor Gavin Newsomfollowing an intense pressure campaign by OpenAI and others. Companies like OpenAI, whose CEO Sam Altman once advocated for industry regulation, havemore recently focusedon clearing away rules that they say could stop them from competing with China in the AI race. “What you’re really doing with this moratorium is creating the Wild West” Khanna concedes that there are “some poorly-crafted state regulations” and making sure the US stays ahead of China in the AI race should be a priority. “But the approach to that should be that we craft good federal regulation,” he says. With the pace and unpredictability of AI innovation, Branch says, “to handcuff the states from trying to protect their citizens” without being able to anticipate future harms, “it’s just reckless.” And if no state legislation is guaranteed for a decade, Khanna says, Congress faces little pressure to pass its own laws. “What you’re really doing with this moratorium is creating the Wild West,” he says. Before the Senate Commerce text was released, dozens of Khanna’s California Democratic colleagues in the House, led by Rep. Doris Matsui (D-CA),signed a letterto Senate leaders urging them to remove the AI provision — saying it “exposes Americans to a growing list of harms as AI technologies are adopted across sectors from healthcare to education, housing, and transportation.” They warn that the sweeping definition of AI “arguably covers any computer processing.” Over 250 state lawmakers representing every state alsourgeCongress to drop the provision. ”As AI technology develops at a rapid pace, state and local governments are more nimble in their response than Congress and federal agencies,” they write. “Legislation that cuts off this democratic dialogue at the state level would freeze policy innovation in developing the best practices for AI governance at a time when experimentation is vital.” Khanna warns that missing the boat on AI regulation could have even higher stakes than other internet policies like net neutrality. “It’s not just going to impact the structure of the internet,” he says. “It’s going to impact people’s jobs. It’s going to impact the role algorithms can play in social media. It’s going to impact every part of our lives, and it’s going to allow a few people [who] control AI to profit, without accountability to the public good, to the American public.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

    "title": "There are only two commissioners left at the FCC",
    "article_text": "﻿After two departures on Friday, parts of Brendan Carr’s agenda are in limbo. ﻿After two departures on Friday, parts of Brendan Carr’s agenda are in limbo. byLauren Feiner After the departure of one Republican and one Democratic commissioner on Friday, the Federal Communications Commission is down to two members, falling below the quorum threshold for what’s typically a five-person panel. Commissioners Nathan Simington and Geoffrey Starks stepped down at the end of the week. That leaves Republican Chair Brendan Carr and Democratic Commissioner Anna Gomez as the two remaining voting members. President Donald Trump hasnominated Republican Senate staffer Olivia Trustyto the commission, but the chamber has yet to vote on her confirmation, which left the agency deadlocked even before these departures. The FCC is in charge of everything from broadband regulations and subsidies funds, to telecommunications mergers enforcement, to spectrum auctions. Without a three-member quorum, some of that work, and the agenda of Trump-aligned Carr, is left in limbo. Starks and Simington both announced the date of their departures earlier this week, though Starksindicated in Marchthat he planned to step down; neither offered specific reasons for their departure. Carr indicated he intends to keep up the pace, writing in ablog postthat “the show must go on.” The FCC isn’t the only agency short its typical number of commissioners — earlier this year Trump ordered the firing (in violation of Supreme Court precedent) of thetwo Democratic commissioners on the Federal Trade Commission. There’s a lot that Carr can at least try to do while awaiting a quorum, even without another Republican commissioner to vote on more partisan proposals. Carr has already used so-called delegated authority to let the FCC’s various bureaus carry out the agency’s work without a vote from the full commission. Verizon’s $20 billion deal to buy Frontier was recentlyapproved by the FCC’s Wireline Competition Bureau, for example, which Gomezcriticized as a “backroom” dealthat should have been brought to a full commission vote. Gomez and Carr can also operate as a two-member board of the commissioners underRule 0.212, allowing them to do most things they normally would besides issue final rules or actions, according to Public Knowledge senior vice president Harold Feld. That could hold up any final action to roll back a host of regulations through Carr’s“Delete, Delete, Delete” initiative, spurred by a Trump executive order, but allow for new notices of proposed rulemakings or other first steps — so long as they can both agree on them. Even if the commission can likely accomplish most of its day-to-day work, Feld warns that operating without a quorum under confusing legal precedents could be risky. “It puts a cloud over everything,” he says. It could also cause problems if theSupreme Court issues an awaited rulingon the future of theUniversal Service Fund, which helps subsidize communications services for rural and low-income households, and requires changes that would need to be approved by a commission vote. Though a Senate vote on Trusty’s confirmation could be scheduled in the coming month or two and officially end the limbo, Feld worries about what could happen if it stretches into hurricane season. After past natural disasters, he says, the FCC has broken red tape to get money for telecommunications networks repairs out faster. “That potentially might be a problem if the FCC doesn’t have a quorum,” he says. “How much are we handicapped in the event of a weather-related crisis? Will we just decide that the bureaus can act on delegated authority? … [Or] is the commission going to be paralyzed to act in the face of a crisis?” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

    "article_text": "Tim Cook’s in the pressure cooker. Tim Cook’s in the pressure cooker. byAllison Johnson It’s early June and the vibes are decidedly off in Cupertino. The hype leading up to Apple’s last two developer conferences felt much different. There was anticipation in 2023 for a potentially groundbreaking new headset. In 2024, there was a sense of urgency leading up to the company’s AI announcements and whispers that Siri might actually, finally be good at something. But 2025? Well, things are different. The Vision Pro was the big announcement at that 2023 show, and it’s, uh, still around. Apple has reportedlycut production due to slow sales, and you canget one at a steep discounton eBay. Maybethe price is wrong. And the big AI announcement last year? How’s that going? As it stands, Apple Intelligence is stalled out. The features that Apple managed to deployare underwhelming, and the meaty update to Siri has been delayed —maybe even for years. It sounds like the whole thing wasa real fiascoinside Apple, and publicly, the companytook down an adshowcasing Siri features that simply don’t exist yet. Ouch. And then there’s the legal stuff. In 2021,a court in California ordered Appleto let developers add links allowing customers to make purchases outside of their apps. The company was also supposed to come up with a rationale for whatever commission it decided to take on those purchases. Apple’s subsequent compliance with this order was so poor that Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers got fed up andblocked the company from takinganyfeeson those purchases and recommended the case for criminal contempt proceedings — all detailed ina seething 80-page decision. Meanwhile, in the EU, regulatorshave fined Applefor practices that fail to comply with the DMA’s antitrust rules,Fortniteisback in the App Store, and oh yeah, President Donald Trump keepswaving tariffs around in Tim Cook’s facewith a cockamamie plan to convince him to build iPhones in the US. What’s a beleaguered tech CEO to do in times like these? Here’s what I’dliketo see at WWDC: Apple showing a little humility. I do not want to see a two-minute Hollywood production of Craig Federighi jumping out of a helicopter or whatever with his expensive haircut flapping in the wind. I would like to see Tim Cook take the stage and own up to the company’s recent missteps. Doesn’t he owe this particular audience some kind of apology after a judge put him on blast for choosingthe worst option for developersat every turn? Shouldn’t he at least acknowledge that the company got out over its skis showing us Apple Intelligence demos on the same stage last year that, by some accounts,were pure vaporware? I do not want to see a two-minute Hollywood production of Craig Federighi jumping out of a helicopter or whatever It would be the right thing to do, but one early indication makes it seem unlikely Apple will choose this path.Daring Fireball’s John Gruber’s annualTalk Showepisode usually features guest appearances by Apple executives who provide color on the big WWDC announcements. But Gruber says that this year, for the first time since 2015, Apple hasdeclined the invitation to join. Notably, Gruberpublished a blog earlier this yeartaking critical aim at Apple’s mishandling of AI features. Coincidence, I’m sure! This is a strong indicator that Apple will choose the more familiar option: project confidence and keep smiling. Instead of a sincere acknowledgement of its misjudgments, we’ll probably see it paper over the disastrous Apple Intelligence rollout with asleek new redesignanda new OS naming conventionfor funsies. They’ll keep pretending that the Vision Pro is a beloved innovation and not just collecting dust on the shelves of early adopters. They’ll keep insisting that notification summaries and a text prompt image generator constitute a worthwhile AI feature set. The trouble is, I don’t think it’ll be enough this time. Apple’s force of personality has sustained it throughpast missteps, but I don’t think the same playbook will work through the current crisis. The stock price is down from its highs earlier in the year — about flat from last June — a federal judge is breathing fire at Tim Cook, and it’s obvious to anyone with an iPhone 16 that Apple Intelligence is half-baked at best. And the vibes? Way, way off. But the thing about a vibe is that you can turn it around. WWDC is Apple’s chance to talk directly to arguably its most important audience: developers. Apple executives would do well to remember that it was apps that made the iPhone what it is today. If developers are going to follow Apple into the next era of AI or XR or whatever the shift may be, then now would be a good time to show them a little humility.

    "title": "TMNT: Tactical Takedown is a radical twist on turn-based strategy",
    "article_text": "It almost feels as snappy as a classic arcade game. It almost feels as snappy as a classic arcade game. byJay Peters I usually struggle with strategy games. They’re typically too hard for me, and I often get overwhelmed at managing multiple characters or squads. But I couldn’t put downTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown, which blends ideas from strategy gamesandclassicTMNTarcade games to keep things snappy, easy to play, and full of action. One wayTactical Takedown— developed byI Am Your Beastmaker Strange Scaffold — keeps things simple is by having you play as just one character in each of the game’s 20 levels. The four turtles have different movesets; Leonardo, for example, uses his swords to aggressively attack enemies, while Michelangelo can zip around the playing field on his skateboard. You’re able to customize each turtle’s arsenal by buying new moves, but I didn’t change the movesets at all and got through the game just fine. Battles take place in a grid overlaid on small chunks of veryTMNTlocations, like a street, sewer, or subway system. Every turn, you have six “action points” to spend as you please, whether that’s moving around the level or attacking bad guys. You just press a button to use one of your moves, no menu required, which speeds things up considerably. You have six hearts and three “lives” — lose a life and the game will quickly flash a “Continue” sign before letting you choose where you’d like to drop in the level to keep the fight going. (You also lose a score multiplier.) The levels feel like tiny dioramas, and while characters will move into a kick or a punch when attacking or a fall when taking damage, they aren’t actively animated moment to moment. It all creates the sense that you’re playing with action figures. PerhapsTactical Takedown’s best trick is that the levels are constantly shifting around you. Every once in a while, the game will show you that a new piece of land is going to drop in on the next turn, and after that spot is in place, you’ll get a warning that another part of the level is going to fall away. It means that you’re constantly dealing with new terrain, layouts, and hazards like poisonous sewage or cars driving by while also strategizing on how to fight bad guys. Sometimes, after adding a new chunk of a level, the game even flashes the word “Go,” encouraging you to move forward like you would in an arcade game. Even better, if there isn’t a wall, you can send enemies flying off the edge of a level into the void, defeating them instantly. It took me a bit to understand that the gamewantsyou to do that as much as possible; occasionally, there will be a lot of bad guys in a level, and the only way to efficiently take them out is by sending them to their doom. For me, it all came together in a level where you play as Leonardo in a subway tunnel. The level started on a subway platform, and then the game signaled that a subway car would appear. I navigated my way onto the subway car, and the platform fell away. After a few turns on the subway car, it “arrived” at the next subway stop, and I had to hop off. It really felt like I was “advancing” through a level in a faster-paced game, and all while managing a legion of enemies with Leonardo’s swords. The genre is usually slow, but when you get in a good rhythm,Tactical Takedownalmost feels as crisp as theTMNTarcade games — despite being a turn-based strategy game.

    "title": "Sovereignty wins the 157th running of the Belmont Stakes",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 7, 2025 / 7:52 PM EDT/ CBS/AP In a rematch that lived up to its billing, Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty galloped to victory over Journalism in muddy conditions at the157th Belmont Stakesin Saratoga Springs, New York, on Saturday in the third leg of the Triple Crown. Sovereignty, who entered the race with 2-to-1 odds, defeated a field of seven challengers. The racemarked a kind of replayof the Derby. Journalism ended up in second again and Baeza was third — the same 1-2-3 as the Derby. Sovereignty won in 2 minutes, 0.69 seconds, beating Journalism by three lengths. Sovereignty, a 3-year-old bay colt, is the first ever horse to win the Derby, skip the Preakness Stakes, and then win the Belmont. The last horse to run in an all three legs of the Triple Crown and win both the Derby and Belmont was Thunder Gulch in 1995. Journalism had entered as the heavy favorite afterwinning the Preakness. Journalism was the only horse who ran in all three legs of the Triple Crown this year. Bob Baffert-trained Rodriguez was in the Belmont after being scratched from the Derby because of a minor foot bruise that also kept the colt out of the Preakness. Sovereignty is owned by Godolphin and trained by Bill Mott. Godolphin is the racing stable of Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. Jockey Junior Alvarado, who rode Sovereignty to victory at the Derby, was also his mount on Saturday. Alvarado  wasfined $62,000and suspended for two racing days in Kentucky by the state's Board of Stewards for allegedly using his riding crop too much in the Derby. Alvarado is appealing the decision. The Belmont took place for a second consecutive time at the historic Saratoga Race Course in upstate New York. The New York Racing Association temporarily relocated it there while Belmont Park on Long Island undergoes nearly half-a-billion dollars in renovations. Because it was held at Saratoga, the Belmont was 1 1/4 miles long instead of the usual 1 1/2 miles, making the race known as the Test of the Champion the same length as the Derby. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "Meet the horses that ran in the Belmont Stakes",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 7, 2025 / 7:49 PM EDT/ CBS News TheBelmont Stakeshosted a rematch Saturday in New York of the top three finishing horses from the Kentucky Derby to close out horse racing's Triple Crown for 2025. Five weeks after Sovereigntywon the Derbyover Journalism and Baeza, the three horses repeated what happened in Kentucky in the last race of the Triple Crown  — the series for 3-year-olds consisting of the Derby, the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont. Connections of Sovereignty decided toskip the Preaknessin Baltimore to prepare for the Belmont, and it paid off. The horse took two of three Triple Crown races this year. Journalism, whowon the Preaknesstwo weeks after coming in second at the Derby, was picked as the morning-line favorite for the Belmont with 8-5 odds. The horse placed second again at the Belmont Stakes after going head to head with Sovereignty. Here's a list of all the horses that raced in the Belmont in order by their number with their morning-lineodds: The Belmont race was 1 1/4 miles long instead of the usual 1 1/2 miles, making the race known as the Test of the Champion the same length as the Derby. The change is due to the Belmont is temporarily being held at Saratoga Race Course in Saratoga Springs, New York, about a 45-minute drive north of the state capital of Albany. \"Shame the Belmont is not a mile-and-a-half,\" said Heart of Honor's trainer, Jamie Osborne, according to a news release after the Preakness. The brown colt didn't have the best start, but passed four horses to finish fifth in the 1 3/16-mile race, the shortest of the Triple Crown races. The Belmont is expected to return to Long Island's Belmont Park next year after the completion of amassive redevelopment project. While the Triple Crown has been won twice in the past decade — with American Pharoahending a 37-year droughtin 2015 andJustifyin 2018 — winning just the Preakness and the Belmont has become more of a novelty. It was last accomplishedin 2005by Afleet Alex, who finished third in the Derby. At the Preakness, Journalism barreled down the stretch to overcome Gosger and win by half a length at Pimlico Race Course. The bay colt was the morning-line favorite for the Preakness as well as the Derby, winning over oddsmakers with four straight victories in California, including April's Santa Anita Derby, March's San Felipe Stakes and December's Los Alamitos Futurity Stakes. Jockey Umberto Rispoli, who was aboard Journalism for those three races, the Preakness and the Derby, had the mount again for the Belmont. Journalism's trainer,Michael McCarthy, has only had one other horse in the Belmont, Rombauer, who came in third in 2021. With 2-1 odds in the morning line, Sovereignty achieved a rarer feat than winning just the Preakness and the Belmont: victories at the Derby and the Belmont. The last horse to do that was Thunder Gulch in 1995 after finishing third at the Preakness. While Sovereignty  skipped the Triple Crown's middle jewel, the bay colt wasn't completely out of the news. His jockey, Junior Alvarado, wasfined $62,000and suspended for two racing days in Kentucky by the state's Board of Stewards for allegedly using his riding crop too much in the Derby. Alvarado is appealing the decision. Alvarado rode Sovereignty again on Saturday, which was the jockey's fourth mount in the Belmont. Last year, he was aboard Resilience, who finished in 10th place and was trained by Bill Mott. The two have teamed up again with Sovereignty. Mott has trained a Belmont winner before — Drosselmeyer, whowon in 2010. Sovereignty came into the Belmont after finishing second at March's Florida Derby and winning the Fountain of Youth Stakes in Florida and October's Street Sense Stakes at Churchill Downs, the home of the Derby. Baeza didn't initially draw a post for the Derby and only entered the field when Rodriguez was scratched from the race two days before the Run for the Roses. He broke from the post on the far outside and came in third behind Journalism by a neck. The horse came in third again at the Belmont. Before the Derby, the bay colt came in second at the Santa Anita Derby, also behind Journalism. Baeza was under Flavien Prat, who also had the mount in the Derby. Prat's been in the past four runnings of the Belmont, riding Hot Rod Charlie to second place in 2021. Trainer John Shirreffs has had three other horses in the Belmont, most recently Gormley, who came in fourthin 2017. Rodriguez wasscratched from the Derbyover what co-owner Tom Ryan described as a \"small but slightly sensitive foot bruise.\" Trainer Bob Baffert said the dark bay colt has healed and is performing as well as he was before he won the Wood Memorial Stakes in April at New York City's Aqueduct Racetrack, according to a New York Racing Association news release. Baffert has trained three Belmont winners: American Pharoah, Justify and Point Given, whowon the raceby 12 1/2 lengths in 2001. With 6-1 odds in the morning line, Rodriguez was under Mike Smith, who would have had his fourth Belmont win. Hill Road, who was given 10-1 morning-line odds for the Belmont, won the Peter Pan Stakes at Aqueduct last month and finished third in the Tampa Bay Derby in March and in November's Breeders' Cup Juvenile in California. Irad Ortiz Jr. was aboard the bay colt in pursuit of his third Belmont win, most recently ridingMo Donegalto victory in 2022. Hill Road will be trainer Chad Brown's fifth career entry in the race. He's still seeking his first Belmont win after coming close with third-place Sierra Leone in 2024 and second-place Gronkowski in 2018. Crudo, who's co-owned by celebrity chefBobby Flay, was given 15-1 odds in the morning line. The bay colt won the Sir Barton Stakes, one of the undercard races for the Preakness, and will be trainer Todd Pletcher's chance for a fifth Belmont win. John Velazquez had the mount as he went for his third victory at the race. Pletcher's second horse in the race, Uncaged, won at Saratoga in August and at Aqueduct in April but came in sixth at the Peter Pan. With 30-1 morning-line odds, the bay colt was under Luis Saez, who won the Belmont withDornochlast year and withEssential Qualityin 2021. With Heart of Honor, Saffie Osborne had another chance to become the first woman to ride to victory in a Triple Crown race since Julie Krone won the Belmont in 1993 aboard Colonial Affair. However, the horse dropped off early in the race. In addition to finishing fifth at the Preakness, the British-bred brown colt raced in the United Arab Emirates, coming in second at the UAE Derby in April.

    "title": "Coco Gauff beats Aryna Sabalenka to win first French Open women's title",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 7, 2025 / 7:37 PM EDT/ CBS/AP Coco Gauffbecame the first American to win the French Open women's title sinceSerena Williamsin 2015 after beating top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka in three sets on Saturday. It is her first French Open title and her second major overall. After a topsy-turvy opening set that Sabalenka edged 7-6 (5), the American tennis star responded with an immediate break and won the second set 6-2 to force a defining third set. She won the third set 6-4. The match was full of tension and momentum swings, amplified by the windy conditions. After Sabalenka sent a backhand wide on Gauff's second match point, the 21-year-old American fell onto her back, covering her face with both hands before resting her forehand on the clay. After greeting Sabalenka at the net, she hugged film director Spike Lee and celebrated with her entourage, three years after she lost in her first final at Roland-Garros. Sabalenka started the deciding set strongly, sticking to her high-risk approach to hold her first service game. Gauff responded by raising her level, winning a superb rally in the third game that drew loud cheers and applause from the crowd. After an intense exchange of drop shots, Gauff hit a lob that Sabalenka chased down before attempting a shot between her legs — only for Gauff to intercept it at the net and finish with a winner. Gauff was consistent from the baseline and earned a breakpoint, which she converted when Sabalenka double-faulted, giving her a 2-1 lead. Sabalenka turned toward her box and shouted in frustration but then regained her composure, breaking back to level the match at 3-3. She was broken again at love, however, and Gauff then held serve twice to claim the title after a match that lasted 2 hours, 38 minutes. In her on-court speech, she said that defeat in 2022 at the age of 18 put her in a \"dark place\" and then thanked the fans on Court-Philippe Chatrier, who were rooting mostly for her. \"The crowd really helped me today, you guys were cheering for me so hard and I don't know what I did to deserve so much love from the French crowd,\" she said. \"But I appreciate you, guys.\" Sabalenka was in tears moments earlier when she made her speech. Struggling to find her words, she praised Gauff for being a \"fighter\" and said she deserved the win, but added that the windy conditions made for an error-strewn contest. \"This will hurt so much. Coco, congrats, in the tough conditions, you were a better player than me,\" she said. \"Well done, great two weeks, and congrats on the second Grand Slam, it's well deserved.\" This is Gauff's second Grand Slam so far. She beat Sabalenka in the2023 U.S. Open final. The 27-year-old Sabalenka, who is from Belarus, has won three majors – two Australian Open titles and one U.S. title – but this was her first appearance in the French Open final. It was the first No. 1 vs. No. 2 final in Paris since 2013, when Serena Williams defeated Maria Sharapova, and just the second in the last 30 years. Sabalenka and Gauff have split their 10 previous matchups evenly, but Sabalenka won their most recent encounter, also on a clay court at the Madrid Open a month ago. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "3 dead, 21 injured in Russian drone and missile attacks on Kharkiv",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 7, 2025 / 7:29 PM EDT/ AP A large Russian drone-and-missile attack targeted Ukraine'ssecond-largest city of Kharkivon Saturday, killing at least three people and wounding 21 others, according to local officials, as hopes for peace dimmed further. The warring sides also accused each other of trying to sabotage a planned prisoner exchange, nearly a week after Kyiv embarrassed the Kremlin with asurprising drone attackon military airfields deep inside Russia. Saturday's barrage — the latest in near daily wide-scale attacks on Ukraine — included aerial glide bombs that have become part of a fierce Russian onslaught in the all-out war, which began on Feb. 24, 2022. As firefighters and emergency workers bustled around attack sites in Kharkiv, residents described the strikes that damaged their homes and nearly took their lives on Saturday morning. Alina Belous said that she had tried to extinguish flames with buckets of water to rescue a young girl trapped inside a burning building who had called out for help. \"We were trying to put it out ourselves with our buckets, together with our neighbors. Then the rescuers arrived and started helping us put out the fire, but there was smoke and they worried that we couldn't stay there. When the ceiling started falling off, they took us out,\" she said. Local resident Vadym Ihnachenko said that he thought at first that it was a neighboring building going up in flames. \"But when we saw sparks coming from the top, we realized it was our building,\" he said. Ukraine's air force said that Russia struck with 215 missiles and drones overnight, and Ukrainian air defenses shot down 87 drones and seven missiles. Several other areas in Ukraine were also hit, including the regions of Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Odesa, and the city of Ternopil, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said in an X post. \"To put an end to Russia's killing and destruction, more pressure on Moscow is required, as are more steps to strengthen Ukraine,\" he said. The Russian Defense Ministry on Saturday said that its forces carried out a nighttime strike on Ukrainian military targets, including ammunition depots, drone assembly workshops, and weaponry repair stations. There was no comment from Moscow on the reports of casualties in Kharkiv. Kharkiv's mayor, Ihor Terekhov, said that the strikes also damaged 18 apartment buildings and 13 private homes. Terekhov said that it was \"the most powerful attack\" on the city since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion. Kharkiv's regional governor, Oleh Syniehubov, said two districts in the city were struck with three missiles, five aerial glide bombs and 48 drones. Among the wounded were two children, a baby boy and a 14-year old girl, he added. Six people are believed to be trapped under the rubble of an industrial facility in Kharkiv's Kyiv district, The Kharkiv prosecutor's office said in a statement on Telegram. Contact with those trapped was lost and rescue attempts have been ongoing since early afternoon, it said, without naming the facility. In the Dnipropetrovsk province further south, two women, ages 45 and 88, were wounded, according to local Gov. Serhii Lysak. Meanwhile, Russia's defense ministry said that its forces shot down 36 Ukrainian drones overnight, over the country's south and west, including near the capital. Drone debris wounded two civilians in the suburbs of Moscow, local Gov. Andrei Vorobyov reported. On Friday, Russia struck six Ukrainian territories, killing at least six people and wounding about 80. Among the dead were three emergency responders in Kyiv, one person in Lutsk and two people in Chernihiv. A U.S.-led diplomatic push for a settlement has brought two rounds of direct peace talks between delegations from Russia and Ukraine, though the negotiations delivered no significant breakthroughs. The sides remain far apart on their terms for an end to the fighting. Ukraine has offered an unconditional 30-day ceasefire and a meeting between its Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to break the deadlock. But the Kremlin has effectively rejected a truce and hasn't budged from its demands. U.S. President Donald Trump said this week thatPutin told him Moscow would respondto Ukraine's attack on Russian military airfields on June 1. Trump also said that it might be better to let Ukraine and Russia \"fight for a while\" before pulling them apart and pursuing peace. Trump's comments were a remarkable detour from his often-stated appeals to stop the war and signaled that he may be giving up onrecent peace efforts. Later on Saturday, Russia and Ukraine each accused the other of endangering plans to swap 6,000 bodies of soldiers killed in action, agreed upon during direct talks in Istanbul on Monday that otherwise made no progress towards ending the war. Vladimir Medinsky, a Putin aide who led the Russian delegation, said that Kyiv called a last-minute halt to an imminent swap. In a Telegram post, Medinsky said that refrigerated trucks carrying more than 1,200 bodies of Ukrainian troops from Russia had already reached the agreed exchange site at the border when the news came. In response, Ukraine said Russia was playing \"dirty games\" and manipulating facts. According to the main Ukrainian authority dealing with such swaps, no date had been set for repatriating the bodies. In a statement Saturday, the agency also accused Russia of submitting lists of prisoners of war for repatriation that didn't correspond to agreements reached on Monday. It wasn't immediately possible to reconcile the conflicting claims. Monday's talks unfolded a day after a string of stunning long-range attacks by both sides, with Ukraine launching the devastating drone assault on Russian air bases, and Moscow launching its largest drone attack of the war against Ukraine. Ukraine's Security Service on Saturday released a video said to show its audacious attack on Russian air fields Sunday in which Kyiv said that 41 Russian military aircraft was destroyed. The video shows the flight path of one explosive-laden first person view, or FPV, drone — from takeoff from the roof of a modular building to the Belaya air field — where it appears to strike a Russian strategic bomber. Other aircraft are seen engulfed in flames, apparently from previous hits in Ukraine's \"Operation Spiderweb.\" A previous round of negotiations in Istanbul, the first time Russian and Ukrainian negotiators sat at the same table since the early weeks of the full-scale invasion, led to 1,000 prisoners on both sides being exchanged. © 2025 The Associated Press.

The August Egg Company recalled about 1.7 million brown organic and brown cage-free egg varieties distributed to grocery stores between February and May because of the potential for salmonella, according to an announcement posted Friday on theFood and Drug Administration's website. At least 79 people in seven states have gotten a strain of salmonella that was linked to the eggs, and 21 people have been hospitalized, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The recall covers Arizona, California, Illinois, Indiana, Nebraska, New Mexico, Nevada, Washington and Wyoming. Plant code numbers for the recalled eggs are P-6562 or CA5330, according to theCDC's website. \"August Egg Company's internal food safety team also is conducting its own stringent review to identify what measures can be established to prevent this situation from recurring,\" according tocommentsposted from the company on the FDA's website. \"We are committed to addressing this matter fully and to implementing all necessary corrective actions to ensure this does not happen again.\" Symptoms of salmonella poisoning include diarrhea, fever, severe vomiting, dehydration and stomach cramps. Most people who get sick recover within a week. Infections can be severe in young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems, who may require hospitalization. The CDC advises people to throw away recalled eggs or return them to the store where they were purchased. Consumers should also wash and disinfect any surfaces that came in contact with the eggs. This is the latest in a string of salmonella-related outbreaks recently involving food. Atomato recallaffecting three southern states was upgraded to a Class I recall, the most severe warning by the Food and Drug Administration. The recall wasfirst announced in Mayover potential salmonella contamination. Also, nearly four dozen people across 18 states are sick with salmonella food poisoning tied torecalled cucumbers, according to federal health officials.In an update, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the expanding outbreak led to at least 16 people being hospitalized. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

The deputy marshal was briefly detained in the lobby of a federal building in Tucson because he “fit the general description of a subject being sought by ICE,” according to a statement from a U.S. Marshals Service spokesperson shared with NBC News on Friday. It is not clear when the incident took place. “The Deputy US Marshal’s identity was quickly confirmed by other law enforcement officers, and he exited the building without incident,” said U.S. Marshals Service spokesperson Colleen Grayman. The U.S. Marshals Service did not provide additional details or identify the deputy marshal who was detained. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which ICE operates under, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Earlier this week, ICE agents made themost immigrant arrests in a single day, detaining more than 2,200 people Tuesday, according to a source familiar with the arrests and an ICE spokesperson who confirmed the numbers, as the agency responds to pressure from the White House to rapidly and dramatically increase arrests.",

    "title": "Israeli forces in Gaza kill 6 Palestinians seeking aid, health officials say",
    "article_text": "Local health officials said Israeli forces killed six Palestinians near an aid distribution center in southern Gaza on Saturday night, the fourth such incident in a week. The Palestinians were killed in west Rafah “as citizens gathered in the hope of receiving aid near the distribution point,” according to Marwan Al-Hams, director of field hospitals for the Palestinian Health Ministry. None of the victims have been identified at this time. NBC News was not immediately able to verify the number of casualties. The World Health Organization has said it considers the Health Ministry’s data reliable. In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces acknowledged the incident, saying that troops fired “warning shots” on “several suspects” in the Tel al-Sultan refugee camp who they felt posed a threat. “Despite prior warnings that the area is an active combat zone during nighttime hours, several suspects attempted to approach IDF troops operating in the Tel al-Sultan area overnight, in a manner that posed a threat to the troops,” the IDF said. “The troops called out to the suspects to drive them away, but as they continued advancing in a way that endangered the troops, the soldiers responded with warning shots.” The IDF did not specify what threat the “suspects” posed and did not take accountability for the reported deaths, but said it “is aware of the reports of casualties.” This is the fourth incident in a week where local health officials said Palestinians were killed near aid distribution centers. On Sunday,more than 30 people were killed in Rafahand hundreds were injured, according to local health officials and aid workers. Speaking with NBC News’ crew on the ground, four witnesses said they came under fire from the air and on the ground while they were waiting to collect aid near a distribution site. An Israeli military official told NBC News that troops fired “warning shots” at “several suspects” about a half-mile from the aid distribution center, calling reports of casualties at the site “false claims.” On Monday, three Palestinians were killed and dozens of others were injured when Israeli forces opened fire at a food distribution site in Rafah, Gaza health officials said. The next day,at least 27 people were killedin the early morning after IDF troops opened fire near an aid distribution point in Rafah, according to local health officials. More than 160 others were injured, including a 5-year-old girl. Video captured by NBC News’ crew on the ground showed people, some dead and others wounded, being rushed toNasser Hospitalin Khan Younis. The IDF said its troops fired “warning fire” at people who they believed posed a threat to them about 0.3 miles from an aid distribution site in Rafah,adding that it was aware of and looking into reports of casualties. It did not elaborate on what threat those people posed.",

    "title": "When it comes to saving, Gen Z asks: 'What's the point?' That's dangerous, expert says",
    "article_text": "Gen Zseems to have a case of economic malaise. Nearly half (49%) of its adult members — the oldest of whom are in their late 20s — sayplanningfor the future feels “pointless,” according to a recent Credit Karmapoll. A freewheeling attitude toward summer spending has taken root among young adults who feel financial “despair” and “hopelessness,” said Courtney Alev, a consumer financial advocate at Credit Karma. They think, “What’s the point when it comes to saving for the future?” Alev said. That “YOLO mindset” among Generation Z — the cohortbornfrom roughly 1997 through 2012 — can be dangerous: If unchecked, it might lead young adults to rack up high-interest debt they can’t easily repay, perhaps leading to delayed milestones like moving out of their parents’ home or saving for retirement, Alev said. But your late teens and early 20s is arguably the best time for young people to develop healthy financial habits: Starting to invest now, even a little bit, will yield ample benefits via decades of compound interest, experts said. “There are a lot of financial implications in the long term if these young people aren’t planning for their financial future and [are] spending willy-nilly however they want,” Alev said. That said, that many feel disillusioned is understandable in the current environment, experts said. The labor markethas been toughlately for new entrants and those looking to switch jobs, experts said. The U.S.unemployment rateis relatively low, at 4.2%. However, it’smuch higherfor Americans 22 to 27 years old: 5.8% for recent college grads and 6.9% for those without a bachelor’s degree, according to Federal Reserve Bank of New York data as of March 2025. Young adults are also saddled with debt concerns, experts said. “They feel they don’t have any money and many of them are in debt,” said Winnie Sun, co-founder and managing director of Sun Group Wealth Partners, based in Irvine, California. “And they’re wondering if the degree they have (or are working toward) will be of value if A.I. takes all their jobs anyway. So is it just pointless?” About 50% of bachelor’s degree recipients in the 2022-23 class graduated with student debt, with an average debt of $29,300,accordingto College Board. The federal governmentrestarted collections on student debt in defaultin May, after a five-year pause. The Biden administration’s efforts to forgive large swaths of student debt, including plans to help reduce monthly payments for struggling borrowers, werelargely stymied in court. “Some hoped some or more of it would be forgiven, and that didn’t turn out to be the case,” said Sun, a member of CNBC’sFinancial Advisor Council. Meanwhile, in a2024 report, the New York Fed found credit card delinquency rates were rising faster for Gen Z than for other generations. About 15% had maxed out their cards, more than other cohorts, it said. It’s also “never been easier to buy things,” with the rise of buy now, pay later lending, for example, Alev said. BNPL has pushed the majority of Gen Z users — 77% — to say the service has encouraged them to spend more than they can afford, according to the Credit Karma survey. The firm polled 1,015 adults ages 18 and older, 182 of whom are from Gen Z. These financial challenges compound an environment of general political and financial uncertainty, amid on-again-off-again tariff policy and its potential impact on inflation and the U.S. economy, for example, experts said. “You start stacking all these things on top of each other and it can create a lack of optimism for young people looking to get started in their financial lives,” Alev said. Young adults should try to rewire their financial mindset, experts said. “Most importantly, you don’t want to bet against yourself,” Sun said. “See it as an opportunity,” she added. “If you’re young and your expenses are low, this is the time to invest as much as you can right now.” Time is working in their favor, due to the ability to compound investment growth over multiple decades, Alev said. While investing might “feel impossible,” every little bit helps, even if it’s just investing $10 a month right now into atax-advantaged retirement account like a Roth IRAor 401(k). The latter is among the easiest ways to start, due to automatic payroll deduction and the possibility of earning a “match” from your employer, which is “probably the closest thing to free money any of us will get in our lifetime,” Alev said.",

    "article_text": "“Love Island USA” contestant Yulissa Escobar has broken her silence about hersudden exitfrom the show. After being dropped from the reality dating series in Episode 2, Escobar took toInstagram Fridayto address speculation about her departure and apologize. Escobar’s departure was linked to backlash she was receiving for using racist language on past podcasts. Thecontroversial clipsresurfaced on social media after Escobar was announced as a Season 7 cast member. In her Instagram post, Escobar said she wanted to “apologize for using a word I had no right in using.” “Podcast clips from years ago have recently resurfaced, and I want to address it directly,” she wrote. “In those clips, I used a word I never should’ve used, a racial slur. I used it ignorantly, not fully understanding the weight, history, or pain behind it. I wasn’t trying to be offensive or harmful, but I recognize now that intention doesn’t excuse impact. And the impact of that word is real. It’s tied to generations of trauma, and it is not mine to use.” Escobar explained that she used the racial slur when she was “speaking casually in conversation” and she didn’t think “deeply or critically about what I was saying.” “But that doesn’t take away from how wrong it was. The truth is, I didn’t know better then, but I do now,” she said. “I’ve taken the time to reflect, to learn, and to grow from that moment.” Escobar went on to say that she’s “changed a lot” since she’s done those podcasts. She noted that she shows up for others differently and also speaks differently as well. “Growth means recognizing when you were wrong, even if it’s uncomfortable, and choosing to move forward with humility and accountability,” she said. The 27-year-old then ended her statement by saying she takes “full ownership of my actions” and she apologized again to anyone who was “disappointed or offended” by her words. Online, she shared her statement alongside a personal quote from herself, which said, “Owning my mistakes speaking my truth.” Escobar wasintroduced as a cast memberfor Season 7 of “Love Island USA” in May. In ateaser videothat Peacock shared on YouTube, Escobar said she was excited to be on the show after her previous “nine year relationship” ended in heartbreak. “I want my man to nurture me,” she said. On the premiere episode of the series, Escobar coupled up with Ace Green. As they were exploring their love connection, series narrator Iain Stirling informed viewers that Escobar would no longer be on the program in an announcement he made on the second episode. “Welcome back to ‘Love Island USA,’” he said. “Yulissa has left the villa.” However, it is unclear when Escobar left Fiji, where the show is filmed, and if she was edited out of episodes.",

    "title": "'Forgotten' 401(k) account fees can cost workers thousands in lost savings",
    "article_text": "With more Americansjob hoppingin the wake of the Great Resignation, the risk of “forgetting” a401(k) planwith a previous employer has jumped, recent studies show. As of 2023, there were 29.2 million left-behind 401(k) accounts holding roughly $1.65 trillion in assets, up 20% from two years earlier, according to the latest data byCapitalize, a fintech firm. Nearly half of employees leave money in their old plans during work transitions, according to a 2024 report fromVanguard. However, that can come at a cost. For starters, 41% of workers are unaware that they are paying401(k)fees at all, a2021 surveyby the U.S. Government Accountability Office found. In most cases,401(k) fees, which can include administrative service costs and fees for investment management, are relatively low, depending on the plan provider. But there could be additional fees on 401(k) accounts left behind from previous jobs that come with an extra bite. Former employees who don’t take their 401(k) with them could be charged an additional fee to maintain those accounts, according to Romi Savova, CEO of PensionBee, an online retirement provider. “If you leave it with the employer, the employer could force the record keeping costs on to you,” she said. According to PensionBee’s analysis, a $4.55 monthly nonemployee maintenance fee on top of other costs can add up to nearly $18,000 in lost retirement funds over time. Not only does the monthly fee eat into the principal, but workers also lose the compound growth that would have accumulated on the balance, the study found. Fees on those forgotten 401(k)s can be particularly devastating for long-term savers, said Gil Baumgarten, founder and CEO of Segment Wealth Management in Houston. That doesn’t necessarily mean it pays to move your balance, he said. “There are two sides to every story,” he said. “Lost 401(k)s can be problematic, but rolling into a IRA could come with other costs.” When workers switch jobs, they may be able to move the funds to a new employer-sponsored plan or roll their old 401(k) funds into an individual retirement account, whichmany people do. But IRAs typically have higher investment fees than 401(k)s and those rollovers can also cost workers thousands of dollars over decades, according to anotherstudy, by The Pew Charitable Trusts, a nonprofit research organization. Collectively, workers who roll money into IRAs could pay$45.5 billionin extra fees over a hypothetical retirement period of 25 years, Pew estimated. Another option is to cash out an old 401(k), which is generally considered theleast desirable optionbecause of the hefty tax penalty. Even so, Vanguard found 33% of workersdo that. While leaving your retirement savings in your former employer’s plan is often the simplest option, the risk of losing track of an old plan has been growing. Now, 25% of all 401(k) plan assets are left behind or forgotten, according to the most recent data from Capitalize, up from 20% two years prior. However, thanks to “Secure 2.0,” a slew ofmeasures affecting retirement savers, the Department of Labor created theretirement savings lost and found databaseto help workers find old retirement plans. “Ultimately, it can’t really be lost,” Baumgarten said. “Every one of these companies has a responsibility to provide statements.” Often simply updating your contact information can help reconnect you with these records, he advised. You can also use your Social Security number to track down funds through theNational Registry of Unclaimed Retirement Benefits, a private-sector database. In 2022, a group oflarge 401(k) plan administratorslaunched the Portability Services Network. That consortiumworks withdefined contributor plan rollover specialist Retirement Clearinghouse on auto portability, or the automatic transfer of small-balance 401(k)s. Depending on the plan, employees with up to $7,000 could have their savings automatically transferred into a workplace retirement account with their new employer when they change jobs. The goal is to consolidate and maintain those retirement savings accounts, rather than cashing them out or risk losing track of them, during employment transitions, according to Mike Shamrell, vice president of thought leadership at Fidelity Investments, the nation’s largest provider of 401(k) plans and a member of the Portability Services Network.",

    "article_text": "President Donald Trump on Saturday said that it wasn’t his decision to bring Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, back to the U.S. to face federal charges, saying the “Department of Justice decided to do it that way, and that’s fine.” “That wasn’t my decision,” Trump said of Abrego Garcia’s return in a phone call with NBC News on Saturday. “It should be a very easy case” for federal prosecutors, the president added. Trump added that he did not speak with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele about Abrego Garcia’s return, even though the two men spoke about Abrego Garciaduring an April meeting in the Oval Office. His remarks came after Abrego Garciaarrived back in the U.S.on Friday and was charged in an indictment alleging he transported people who were not legally in the country. The indictment came amid a protracted legal battle over whether to bring him back from El Salvador that escalated all the way up to the Supreme Court. Abrego Garcia’s family and lawyers have called him a family man, while Trump and his administration have alleged that he is a member of the gang MS-13. The casedrew national attentionamid the Trump administration’s broader push for mass deportations. After Abrego Garcia’s deportation, lawyers for the Trump administration said he was deported in an “administrative error,” as Abrego Garcia had previous legal protection from deportation to El Salvador. Still, the Trump administration did not attempt to bring Abrego Garcia back, even as the Supreme Court ruled that it had to “facilitate” his return to the U.S. Democrats, including Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., had for weeks said that Abrego Garcia was denied due process when he was detained and deported, arguing that he should have been allowed to defend himself from deportation before he was sent to El Salvador. Trump on Saturday called Van Hollen, whowent to visit Abrego Garciain jail in El Salvador in April, a “loser” for defending the man’s right to due process. “He’s a loser. The guy’s a loser. They’re going to lose because of that same thing. That’s not what people want to hear,” the president said about Van Hollen. “He’s trying to defend a man who’s got a horrible record of abuse, abuse of women in particular. No, he’s a total loser, this guy.” On Friday, Attorney General Pam Bondi alleged that Abrego Garcia “was a smuggler of humans and children and women. He made over 100 trips, the grand jury found, smuggling people throughout our country.” In a statement Friday, Abrego Garcia’s lawyer called Bondi’s move “an abuse of power, not justice.”",

    "article_text": "Olympic gymnastics champion Simone Biles is going head-to-head with one of the most vocal opponents of transgender girls and women competing in female sports, former college swimmer Riley Gaines. Biles — the most decorated Olympic gymnast is history — called the former college athlete “sick” and a “sore loser” in apost on XFriday night. “You should be uplifting the trans community and perhaps finding a way to make sports inclusive OR creating a new avenue where trans feel safe in sports,” Biles, 28, wrote. “Maybe a transgender category IN ALL sports!!” “But instead… You bully them,” Biles continued. “One things for sure is no one in sports is safe with you around!!!!!” As a college swimmer, Gaines tied for fifth place in a competition with then-University of Pennsylvania swimmer Lia Thomas, who is transgender, in 2022. Since then, Gaines has largely built a career as a pundit in conservative mediaadvocating against trans women competing in female sports, arguing that it is unfair to include them in competition and their inclusion is at times unsafe for other competitors. Gaines, 25, has also built an enormous following on social media, with over 1.5 million followers on X, where she regularly lambastes and mocks transgender athletes. On Friday, Gainesposted an imageof a Minnesota girls high school baseball team, which supposedly includes a trans player. She appeared to taunt the player, referring to her as a boy, which appears to have elicited Biles’ response. Gaines almost immediately responded to Biles’ criticism in a series of posts on X. “This is so disappointing. My take is the least controversial take on the planet,” Gaines wrote. “Simone Biles being a male-apologist at the expense of young girls’ dreams? Didn’t have that on my bingo card.” The issues of trans girls and women competing in female sports has become a lightning rod issue in the United States in recent years. In February, President Donald Trumpsigned an executive orderaiming to prohibit transgender women and girls from competing in female sports. Before that, at least 27 states already had laws, regulations or policiesbanning transgender students from participating in sportsconsistent with their gender identities, according to the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ think tank.",

    "title": "At least 1.7 million eggs recalled as CDC and FDA investigate multistate salmonella outbreak",
    "article_text": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration are investigating a multistate Salmonella outbreak linked to at least 1.7 million eggs, according to a news release issued on Saturday. The brown cage-free and brown certified organic eggs were distributed by the August Egg Company from Feb. 3 through May 15 to retailers in nine states — California, Nevada, Washington, Arizona, Nebraska, New Mexico, Illinois, Indiana and Wyoming,per the FDA. In anannouncementissued Friday, the Hilmar, California-based distribution company recalled 1.7 million eggs, which have sell-by dates ranging from March 4 to June 19 and were sold at retailers including Walmart and Safeway, as well as under many different brands that can be seenhere. So far, the outbreak has sickened 79 people in New Jersey, Kentucky, Nebraska, Nevada, Arizona, Washington state and California, theCDCsaid. At least 21 people have been hospitalized, and no deaths have been reported. “This outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses, and the true number of sick people is likely much higher than the number reported,” the CDC said. “This is because many people recover without medical care and are not tested for Salmonella.” Salmonella is a type of bacteria that can make people sick if they consume contaminated food and water, or touch animals, their fecal matter or the areas they live in, according to the CDC. It is “a leading cause of food-borne illness, hospitalizations, and deaths in the United States and worldwide,” causing about 1.35 million infections in the U.S. every year. Symptoms include diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps and can start six hours to six days after consumption of the bacteria. Children under five, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems can become seriously ill as a result of contracting salmonella. The CDC is advising anyone who has the recalled eggs in their home to throw them away or return them to the retailer that sold them. Businesses with recalled eggs should not sell or serve them, and should sanitize any item or surface that came into contact with the eggs. The August Egg Company said it began taking its eggs to an “egg-breaking facility” to pasteurize them and kill pathogens after learning about the salmonella concern. “August Egg Company’s internal food safety team also is conducting its own stringent review to identify what measures can be established to prevent this situation from recurring,” the company said in a statement. “We are committed to addressing this matter fully and to implementing all necessary corrective actions to ensure this does not happen again.” This isn’t the only salmonella outbreak the U.S. is currently grappling with. Last month, theFDA announced a recall of cucumbersgrown by Bedner Growers and distributed by Fresh Start Produce Sales due toa salmonella outbreakthat has sickened 45 people and hospitalized 16 across 18 states. The FDA’s investigation into the cucumbers is ongoing.",

    "title": "Trump says Musk will face 'very serious consequences' if he funds Democrats",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump on Saturday said there would be “serious consequences” if tech mogul Elon Musk funds Democratic candidates to run against Republicans who vote in favor of the GOP’s sweeping budget bill. “If he does, he’ll have to pay the consequences for that,” Trump told NBC News in a phone interview, but declined to share what those consequences would be. “He’ll have to pay very serious consequences if he does that,” he added. The president also said he has no desire to repair his relationship with Musk after a feud between the two menerupted into public viewearlier this week. “No,” Trump said when asked if he had any wish to do so. Asked if he thought his relationship with the Tesla and SpaceX CEO was over, Trump said, “I would assume so, yeah.” Trump’s comments were the most extensive since he and Musk exchanged threats and attacks on X and Truth Social earlier this week. He added that he thought the Republican Party was more unified than ever after the two men fell out in front of the world. Trump said he has no plans to speak with Musk anytime soon. “I’m too busy doing other things,” he said, adding, “I have no intention of speaking to him.” Trump also accused Musk of being “disrespectful to the office of the President.” “I think it’s a very bad thing, because he’s very disrespectful. You could not disrespect the office of the President,” he added. Musk on Thursday launched a barrage of posts on X against the president, including a now-deleted post highlighting the onetimelinks between the president and the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. “That’s called ‘old news,’ that’s been old news, that has been talked about for years,” Trump said on Saturday. “Even Epstein’s lawyer said I had nothing to do with it. It’s old news.” In the days leading up to their public falling out, Musk had been critical of a GOP-led spending bill that the House passed last month. In the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump responded to Musk’s criticisms, telling reporters, “I’m very disappointed because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill. I’m very disappointed in Elon. I’ve helped Elon a lot.” Shortly after those comments, Musk launched his flurry of posts, including a now-deleted post promoting acall for Trump to be impeachedand another where he said the president’s tariff agendawould cause a recessionlater this year. Trump on Thursday also responded with his own posts on Truth Social. In one post, hewrote, “I don’t mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago,” suggesting that Musk knew what was in the bill before it was passed. He alsowroteon Thursday, “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,” referring to federal contracts with SpaceX. “I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!” On Saturday, Trump said he hadn’t given his suggestion about canceling Musk’s companies’ federal contracts any more thought. “I’d be allowed to do that,” he said, “but I have, I haven’t given it any thought.” Trump also responded to calls from outside allies, like conservative activist Steve Bannon, who have said that Musk’s business dealings and immigration record should be investigated by the federal government. The president told NBC News that he hasn't had those conversations. “I mean it’s not something that’s on top of my mind right now,\" Trump said. He also cast doubt on the notion that Musk’s opposition to the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” is jeopardizing the bill’s chances of success, saying he’s “very confident” that the bill will pass the Senate before July 4. “The Republican Party has never been united like this before. It’s never been. It’s actually more so than it was three days ago,” Trump said. Musk contributed major financial support to Trump’s presidential bid in 2024, spendingover a quarter of a billion dollarsto boost him in swing states last year. In the first months of the administration, Trump put Musk in charge of the Department of Government Efficiency, where he oversaw mass layoffs of federal workers and the shuttering or partial closing of several agencies. The feud, Trump said, has made lawmakers see the benefits of the bill. “I think, actually, Elon brought out the strengths of the bill because people that weren’t as focused started focusing on it, and they see how good it is,” Trump said. “So in that sense, there was a big favor. But I think Elon, really, I think it’s a shame that he’s so depressed and so heartbroken.” During an interview on “This Past Weekend w/ Theo Von” that was taped on Thursday but released Saturday, Vice President JD Vance described Musk’s attacks on Trump as \"nuclear\" and said that it may not be possible for Musk to \"come back into the fold.\" “I’m always going to be loyal to the president, and I hope that eventually Elon, kind of, comes back into the fold,” Vance told podcaster Theo Von. “Maybe that’s not possible now because he’s gone so nuclear.” The vice president also called it a “huge mistake” for Musk to target the president over his frustrations with the House version of the bill, saying, “The process in D.C., if you’re a business leader, you probably get frustrated with that process because it’s more, you know, bureaucratic, it’s more slow moving.\" He added, \"I think there’s just some frustrations there. But I really, man, I think it’s a huge mistake for him to go after the president like that.”",

    "title": "Search expands for former Army soldier accused of killing his 3 young daughters",
    "article_text": "SEATTLE — Authorities have closed a wide swath of popular campgrounds and backpacking areas along the Pacific Crest Trail in Washington as they search fora former Army soldier wanted in the deaths of his three young daughters. Dozens of additional law enforcement officers from an array of agencies joined the investigation and search Friday forTravis Caleb Decker, 32, four days after the girls — 9-year-old Paityn Decker, 8-year-old Evelyn Decker and 5-year-old Olivia Decker — were found dead at a remote campsite outside Leavenworth. The girls' mother reported them missing the night of May 30 whenDecker failed to return them to her homein Wenatchee, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) east of Seattle, after a scheduled visit. Gov. Bob Ferguson announced Friday night that he was ordering the state's National Guard to help with the search, saying \"we will be providing helicopter transportation for law enforcement as they search in remote areas.\" \"The brutal murder of these young children has shocked our state,\" he added in a statement on social media. \"I'm committed to supporting law enforcement as they seek justice for Paityn, Evelyn and Olivia.\" The Chelan County Sheriff's Office said in a statement that there were more than 100 officers involved in the search, which covered rugged terrain in the Cascade Mountains of central Washington, and more than 500 tips had poured in from the public. \"Out of an abundance of caution, we have been given notice to, and are working in conjunction with our surrounding counties in the event Mr. Decker moves through the forest into their jurisdiction,\" the statement said. Decker was an infantryman in the Army from March 2013 to July 2021 and deployed to Afghanistan for four months in 2014, according to Army spokesperson Lt. Col. Ruth Castro. From 2014 to 2016, he was an automatic rifleman with the 75th Ranger Regiment at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington. Last September his ex-wife, Whitney Decker, wrote in a petition to modify their parenting plan that his mental health issues had worsened and that he had become increasingly unstable, often living out of his truck. She sought to restrict him from having overnight visits with the girls until he found housing. \"He has made huge sacrifices to serve our country and loves his girls very much but he has got to get better,\" she wrote. \"I do not want to keep Travis from the girls at all. ... But I cannot have our girls staying in what is essentially a homeless shelter, at times unsupervised, with dozens of strange men, or staying in a tent or living in his truck with him both in extreme temperatures and unknown areas for their safety.\" Authorities warned people to be on the lookout for Decker and asked those with remote homes, cabins or outbuildings to keep them locked, to leave blinds open so law enforcement can see inside and to leave exterior lights on. It was unclear if Decker was armed, but the Chelan County Sheriff's Office said he should be considered dangerous. A reward of up to $20,000 was offered for information leading to his arrest. An online fundraiser for Whitney Decker raised more than $1 million, and friends Amy Edwards, who taught the girls in a theater program called \"Short Shakespeareans,\" and Mark Belton thanked supporters during a news conference Thursday. \"Their laughter, curiosity and spirit left a mark on all of us,\" Edwards said. \"They were the kind of children that everyone rooted for, looked forward to seeing and held close in their hearts.\" Edwards and Belton said Whitney Decker hopes the tragedy prompts changes to the state's Amber Alert system as well as improvements in mental health care for veterans. The night the girls were reported missing, Wenatchee police asked the Washington State Patrol to issue an Amber Alert but it declined, saying that as a custody matter without an imminent threat, the case did not meet the criteria for one. The patrol did issue an \"endangered missing person alert\" the next day, but those do not result in notifications being sent to mobile phones. As searches expanded for the girls last weekend, a sheriff's deputy found Decker's pickup in the area of Rock Island Campground, northwest of Leavenworth. There were two bloody handprints on the tailgate. The girls' bodies were discovered down an embankment nearby with evidence that they had been bound with zip ties, according to an affidavit filed in support of murder and kidnapping charges against Decker. County Coroner Wayne Harris said Friday that his office was awaiting pathology results to determine when and how the girls were killed. Authorities issued closure notices the previous day for that camping area, which lies in the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, as well as for a large swath of rugged territory to the north. That included trails and campgrounds along the Pacific Crest Trail, which runs from the Canadian border to Mexico, and around Stehekin, at the northern end of Lake Chelan.",

    "title": "Coco Gauff defeats top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka in 3 sets to win her first French Open title",
    "article_text": "PARIS — Coco Gauff won theFrench Openfor the first time by defeating top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-4 in Saturday’s final. The second-rankedGauffcame out on top of a contest that was full of tension and momentum swings to claim her second major trophy after the2023 U.S. Open, where she also came from a set down to beat Sabalenka in the final. Gauff raised the winners’ trophy aloft, then kissed it several times. She held her hand over her heart when the U.S. national anthem played. It was the first No. 1 vs. No. 2 final in Paris since 2013, when Serena Williams defeated Maria Sharapova, and just the second in the last 30 years. After Sabalenka sent a backhand wide on Gauff’s second match point, the 21-year-old American fell onto her back, covering her face with both hands as she started to sob, then got up and held her hand over her mouth. She continued to sob as she patted the clay with her left hand. After greeting Sabalenka at the net with a warm hug and thanking the umpire, Gauff screamed out with joy and relief, then got to her knees and crouched forward, continuing to cry as she savored the win. She hugged later film director Spike Lee and celebrated with her entourage in her box, three years after she lost in her first Grand Slam final at Roland-Garros. In her on-court speech, she said that defeat in2022 at the age of 18put her in a “dark place” and then thanked the fans on Court-Philippe Chatrier, who were rooting mostly for her. “The crowd really helped me today, you guys were cheering for me so hard and I don’t know what I did to deserve so much love from the French crowd,” she said. “But I appreciate you, guys.” Sabalenka was in tears moments earlier when she made her speech. Struggling to find her words, she praised Gauff for being a “fighter” and said she deserved the win, but added that the windy conditions made for an error-strewn contest. “This will hurt so much. Coco, congrats, in the tough conditions you were a better player than me,” she said. “Well done, great two weeks, and congrats on the second Grand Slam, it’s well deserved.” Sabalenka started the deciding set strongly, sticking to her high-risk approach to hold her first service game. Gauff responded by raising her level, winning a superb rally in the third game that drew loud cheers. After an intense exchange of drop shots, Gauff hit a lob that Sabalenka chased down before attempting a shot between her legs — only for Gauff to intercept it at the net and finish with a winner. Gauff was consistent from the baseline and earned a break point which she converted when Sabalenka double-faulted, giving her a 2-1 lead. Sabalenka turned toward her box and shouted in frustration but then regained her composure, breaking back to level the match at 3-3. She was broken again at love, however, and Gauff then held serve twice to claimed the title after a match that lasted 2 hours, 38 minutes. Gauff now owns two French Open trophies after winning last year’swomen’s doublestitle.",

    "article_text": "Clare Marie Schneider Recalled organic and cage-free brown eggs distributed by August Egg Company have the plant code number P-6562 or CA5330 printed on their carton or packaging.U.S. Food and Drug Administrationhide caption As of Friday, a salmonella outbreak linked to a California egg producer had sickened at least 79 people. Of the infected people, 21 hospitalizations were reported,U.S. health officials said. Organic and cage-free brown eggs from August Egg Company with specific sell-by dates distributed across nine states and retail locations should be thrown away or returned to where they were purchased,the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The CDC report acknowledged that the number of sick people in the outbreak was likely much higher than the number reported, because most people with salmonella recover without seeking medical care or getting tested for the bacterial infection. August Egg Company voluntarily recalled 1.7 million dozen eggs that may be contaminated with salmonella,according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In a company announcement shared by the federal agency, the egg supplier said that as soon as it found possible Salmonella contamination, it began diverting all eggs from its processing plant to an egg-breaking facility,which pasteurizes the eggs to remove bacteria. The recalled eggs were sold under several brand names, including Clover, First Street, Nulaid, O Organics, Marketside, Raleys, Simple Truth, Sun Harvest and Sunnyside. The recalled eggs were sold in California and Nevada with sell-by dates from March 4, 2025, to June 4, 2025, at grocery stores and retail locations including Save Mart, FoodMaxx, Lucky, Smart & Final, Safeway, Raley's, Food 4 Less and Ralphs. They were also distributed to Walmart locations in Nevada and California and seven other states — Washington, Arizona, Wyoming, New Mexico, Nebraska, Indiana and Illinois —with different sell-by dates ranging from March 4, 2025, to June 19, 2025. Inthe CDC report from Friday, officials confirmed they had identified two illness \"sub-clusters,\" groups of people who became sick after eating at the same location or event, such as a restaurant. According to the report, eggs were served at both locations. Last month,San Diego health officials reportedrecording 37 probable and confirmed cases of people sick with Salmonella after dining at a restaurant in the San Diego area. In a statement released on May 8, city officials said, \"The source of the Salmonella outbreak has not been identified and the investigation is ongoing.\" Symptoms of salmonella include diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps. Most people recover from the bacterial disease within a week, but it can be fatal in children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems. To determine whether you have recalled eggs in your home,the FDA reportedthat the contaminated eggs have the plant code number P-6562 or CA5330 printed on their packaging.

    "article_text": "Brian Mann President Donald Trump, center, and Vice President JD Vance, right, and Elon Musk met backstage prior to a presidential campaign event at the Butler Farm Show in Butler, Pa., on Oct. 5, 2024.Bloomberg/Getty Imageshide caption Vice President Vance says he's \"loyal\" to President Trump, but also voiced praise for billionaire Elon Musk and described Musk's criticism of Trump's sweeping budget bill as \"understandable.\" Vance's comments came on social media and duringa podcast appearance with comedian Theo Vonposted on Saturday. Vance weighed in during a week when thefeud between Trump and Muskwas escalating rapidly and the vice president appeared eager to stake out a middle ground. The interviewreportedlytook place on Thursday, with Von and Vance posting on social media that day about their conversation. \"My loyalties are always going to be with the president,\" Vance told Von. But he also described Musk as an \"incredible entrepreneur\" and added that \"DOGE was really good, this sort of effort to root out waste, fraud and abuse in our country was really good.\" Slow news day, what are we even going to talk about?@TheoVonpic.twitter.com/LVmtK219Dt DOGE is a controversial cost- and bureaucracy-cutting effort launched by the Trump administration, with Musk as the guiding force.  Last month,Musk announcedhis departure from government, though the DOGE will continue to function. Posting Friday and early Saturday on the social media platform X, which he owns, Musk seemed uninterested in finding middle ground with Trump. He blasted the Republican budget bill backed by the president, arguing the measure, passed by the House and now being considered by the Senate would result in unsustainable debt for the U.S. government and taxpayers. \"Congress is bankrupting America,\"Musk wrote. He also suggested that his followers could break with Trump and the GOP, calling for the creation of a new political party. \"The people have spoken. A new political party is needed in America to represent the 80% in the middle!\"he said. Posting on his own social media platform Truth Social, meanwhile, Trump defended his budget plan, which independentanalysts within the federal government say will result in soaring deficitsover the next decade. \"I don't mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago,\"Trump wrote. \"This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress,\" he added.  In other posts, Trump suggested Musk\"went crazy\"andsaid the \"easiest way to save moneyin our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts.\" Asked by Von during the podcast appearance why Musk had broken ranks so publicly with Trump over the spending bill, Vance said, \"I get the frustration there.\" \"I understand, like, it's a good bill, it's not a perfect bill. The process in D.C., if you're a business leader, you probably get frustrated with that process,\" Vance said. Last July,NPR reported that Vance rose to prominencein part with the support of tech billionaires, including Musk. But posting on X on Thursday, Vance said he believes Trump has \"earned the trust of the movement he leads,\" and added, \"I'm proud to stand beside him.\" President Trump has done more than any person in my lifetime to earn the trust of the movement he leads. I'm proud to stand beside him. Speaking with Von, the vice president said he feared Musk's personal attacks on Trump — calling for the president's impeachment and linking Trump toJeffrey Epstein, in a tweet that was later deleted — would be difficult to walk back. \"I hope that eventually Elon kind of comes back into the fold. Maybe that's not possible now because he's gone so nuclear,\" Vance said. Speaking Friday on NPR'sMorning Edition, former Trump advisor Steve Bannonalso voiced the view that the relationship between Musk and Trump's MAGA movement is permanently damaged. \"He crossed the Rubicon by this outrageous comparison to the Epstein files, about saying President Trump should be impeached, replaced by JD Vance,\" Bannon said. Speaking with NBC Newsin an interview broadcast on Saturday, Trump said Musk would face serious consequences if he backed Democratic candidates in future elections. \"He'll have to pay very serious consequences if he does that,\" Trump said. Musk's companies rely heavily on federal contracts and subsidies. The U.S., meanwhile looks to Musk's company Space X for a wide range of services.  Musk was alsoTrump's biggest campaign donor in 2024and has used his social media platformX as a megaphone for conservative causes. Speaking with Von, Vance acknowledged that the break-up between two of the most powerful men in the world could have far-reaching implications: \"I think that if [Musk] and the president are in some blood feud, most importantly it's going to be bad for the country, but I don't think it's going to be good for Elon either.\" Vance also disputed Musk's claim the president might be implicated in wrongdoing linked toEpstein, who socialized with Trumpin Florida and New York and laterdied by suicide in 2019 while awaiting a federal trialon child sex-trafficking charges. \"Absolutely not.  Donald Trump didn't do anything wrong with Jeffrey Epstein,\" Vance said, adding, \"that's total B.S.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "By Jeff Lunden , Scott Detrow 78th Tony Awards preview: What to expect on Broadway's biggest night SCOTT DETROW, HOST:Tomorrow night, the 78th Tony Awards will be presented at Radio City Music Hall. It is Broadway's biggest night, and we are talking about it with Jeff Lunden, who covers Broadway for NPR. Hey, Jeff.JEFF LUNDEN, BYLINE: Hey, Scott.DETROW: So we had more than 40 productions this year on Broadway. How would you say the season was?LUNDEN: Well, I think it was one of the best seasons in memory. There are a lot of excellent new musicals, plays and revivals. And two of the plays up for Tonys this year have already won the Pulitzer Prize...DETROW: Wow.LUNDEN: ...\"Purpose,\" by Branden Jacobs-Jenkins - that's kind of the front-runner - and \"English\" by Sanaz Toossi. But in the musicals category, there are three shows that picked up 10 nominations apiece. One of them, \"Maybe Happy Ending,\" has got to be considered the leading contender, and it has a kind of weird premise. It's an original sci-fi story about two retired robots in South Korea who fall in love, which sounds kind of loopy, but it's charming, off-kilter, beautifully directed and acted, and Darren Criss and Helen J. Shen play the robots.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WHEN YOU'RE IN LOVE\")DARREN CRISS AND HELEN J SHEN: (As Oliver and Claire) When you're in love, you are the loneliest. You're only half when one is what you were.LUNDEN: It's not the only off-kilter original musical up for a Tony. There are two shows based on real historical events which feature corpses in the plot - the English import about a World War II false flag operation run by MI5, the British Intelligence Agency, \"Operation Mincemeat\"...(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"BORN TO LEAD\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS #1: (As characters, singing) But we were born to lead.LUNDEN: ...And \"Dead Outlaw,\" about the history of an American wannabe robber in the early 20th century, both before and after his death.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"DEAD\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As character, singing) Your mama's dead.UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character, singing) Your daddy's dead.UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As character, singing) Your brother's dead.UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character, singing) And so are you.LUNDEN: Rounding out the category are \"Buena Vista Social Club,\" based on the lives of the Cuban musicians who recorded the popular 1997 album - that's already getting a special Tony for its live onstage band - and \"Death Becomes Her,\" based on the popular film.DETROW: Let's talk about one really competitive category with some powerhouses in it, leading actress in a musical.LUNDEN: Well, there are five great nominees. Both lead actresses in \"Death Becomes Her\" are up for the award, but most people agree that it's a two- or three-way race. Audra McDonald is up for her record-breaking 11th nomination playing Mama Rose in the revival of \"Gypsy.\"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"EVERYTHING'S COMING UP ROSES\")AUDRA MCDONALD: (As Mama Rose, singing) Honey, everything's coming up roses.LUNDEN: And former Pussycat Doll Nicole Scherzinger is giving a profoundly odd and compelling performance as Norma Desmond in an avant-garde revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber's \"Sunset Boulevard.\"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WITH ONE LOOK\")NICOLE SCHERZINGER: (As Norma Desmond, singing) With one look, I can break your heart.LUNDEN: And finally, if the vote is split, newcomer Jasmine Amy Rogers might win for her frothy performance as Betty Boop in \"BOOP!\"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WHERE I WANNA BE\")JASMINE AMY ROGERS: (As Betty Boop, singing) Yeah, but now that I've come here, it's where I wanna be.LUNDEN: It's almost an embarrassment of riches this year.DETROW: Well, speaking of riches, Jeff, I'm confused because this was the highest-grossing Broadway season ever, but I thought attendance was still down from the pandemic.LUNDEN: Well, it was, but the highest gross came about because of high-ticket prices charged for some shows featuring Hollywood actors, Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal and George Clooney. And their shows made back their investment, but the general outlook on Broadway is a little less rosy. Only 1 in 10 shows is turning a profit because of skyrocketing production costs. But even though the odds are long for investors, with musicals, the hope is to create something that becomes a huge moneymaker, like \"Hamilton\" or \"Wicked,\" which can run for years on Broadway and go on tour.DETROW: Are you feeling any of that \"Wicked\" or \"Hamilton\" energy from any of these new shows?LUNDEN: Not really at the moment, though \"Buena Vista Social Club\" and \"Death Becomes Her\" have already announced tours. But they'll all get their shot when they do numbers on the Tonys. And speaking of numbers on the Tonys, the original cast of \"Hamilton\" is getting back together to do a song in honor of the show's 10th anniversary.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"MY SHOT\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #3: (As character, singing) Oh, who are you?UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #4: (As character, singing) Who are you?UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #5: (As character, singing) Who are you?UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS #2: (As characters, singing) Ooh, who is this kid?

Audra McDonald is up for her record-breaking 11th nomination playing Mama Rose in the revival of \"Gypsy.\"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"EVERYTHING'S COMING UP ROSES\")AUDRA MCDONALD: (As Mama Rose, singing) Honey, everything's coming up roses.LUNDEN: And former Pussycat Doll Nicole Scherzinger is giving a profoundly odd and compelling performance as Norma Desmond in an avant-garde revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber's \"Sunset Boulevard.\"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WITH ONE LOOK\")NICOLE SCHERZINGER: (As Norma Desmond, singing) With one look, I can break your heart.LUNDEN: And finally, if the vote is split, newcomer Jasmine Amy Rogers might win for her frothy performance as Betty Boop in \"BOOP!\"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WHERE I WANNA BE\")JASMINE AMY ROGERS: (As Betty Boop, singing) Yeah, but now that I've come here, it's where I wanna be.LUNDEN: It's almost an embarrassment of riches this year.DETROW: Well, speaking of riches, Jeff, I'm confused because this was the highest-grossing Broadway season ever, but I thought attendance was still down from the pandemic.LUNDEN: Well, it was, but the highest gross came about because of high-ticket prices charged for some shows featuring Hollywood actors, Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal and George Clooney. And their shows made back their investment, but the general outlook on Broadway is a little less rosy. Only 1 in 10 shows is turning a profit because of skyrocketing production costs. But even though the odds are long for investors, with musicals, the hope is to create something that becomes a huge moneymaker, like \"Hamilton\" or \"Wicked,\" which can run for years on Broadway and go on tour.DETROW: Are you feeling any of that \"Wicked\" or \"Hamilton\" energy from any of these new shows?LUNDEN: Not really at the moment, though \"Buena Vista Social Club\" and \"Death Becomes Her\" have already announced tours. But they'll all get their shot when they do numbers on the Tonys. And speaking of numbers on the Tonys, the original cast of \"Hamilton\" is getting back together to do a song in honor of the show's 10th anniversary.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"MY SHOT\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #3: (As character, singing) Oh, who are you?UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #4: (As character, singing) Who are you?UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #5: (As character, singing) Who are you?UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS #2: (As characters, singing) Ooh, who is this kid?

Hey, Jeff.JEFF LUNDEN, BYLINE: Hey, Scott.DETROW: So we had more than 40 productions this year on Broadway. How would you say the season was?LUNDEN: Well, I think it was one of the best seasons in memory. There are a lot of excellent new musicals, plays and revivals. And two of the plays up for Tonys this year have already won the Pulitzer Prize...DETROW: Wow.LUNDEN: ...\"Purpose,\" by Branden Jacobs-Jenkins - that's kind of the front-runner - and \"English\" by Sanaz Toossi. But in the musicals category, there are three shows that picked up 10 nominations apiece. One of them, \"Maybe Happy Ending,\" has got to be considered the leading contender, and it has a kind of weird premise. It's an original sci-fi story about two retired robots in South Korea who fall in love, which sounds kind of loopy, but it's charming, off-kilter, beautifully directed and acted, and Darren Criss and Helen J.

And their shows made back their investment, but the general outlook on Broadway is a little less rosy. Only 1 in 10 shows is turning a profit because of skyrocketing production costs. But even though the odds are long for investors, with musicals, the hope is to create something that becomes a huge moneymaker, like \"Hamilton\" or \"Wicked,\" which can run for years on Broadway and go on tour.DETROW: Are you feeling any of that \"Wicked\" or \"Hamilton\" energy from any of these new shows?LUNDEN: Not really at the moment, though \"Buena Vista Social Club\" and \"Death Becomes Her\" have already announced tours.

How would you say the season was?LUNDEN: Well, I think it was one of the best seasons in memory. There are a lot of excellent new musicals, plays and revivals. And two of the plays up for Tonys this year have already won the Pulitzer Prize...DETROW: Wow.LUNDEN: ...\"Purpose,\" by Branden Jacobs-Jenkins - that's kind of the front-runner - and \"English\" by Sanaz Toossi. But in the musicals category, there are three shows that picked up 10 nominations apiece. One of them, \"Maybe Happy Ending,\" has got to be considered the leading contender, and it has a kind of weird premise. It's an original sci-fi story about two retired robots in South Korea who fall in love, which sounds kind of loopy, but it's charming, off-kilter, beautifully directed and acted, and Darren Criss and Helen J. Shen play the robots.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WHEN YOU'RE IN LOVE\")DARREN CRISS AND HELEN J SHEN: (As Oliver and Claire) When you're in love, you are the loneliest.

But in the musicals category, there are three shows that picked up 10 nominations apiece. One of them, \"Maybe Happy Ending,\" has got to be considered the leading contender, and it has a kind of weird premise. It's an original sci-fi story about two retired robots in South Korea who fall in love, which sounds kind of loopy, but it's charming, off-kilter, beautifully directed and acted, and Darren Criss and Helen J. Shen play the robots.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WHEN YOU'RE IN LOVE\")DARREN CRISS AND HELEN J SHEN: (As Oliver and Claire) When you're in love, you are the loneliest. You're only half when one is what you were.LUNDEN: It's not the only off-kilter original musical up for a Tony. There are two shows based on real historical events which feature corpses in the plot - the English import about a World War II false flag operation run by MI5, the British Intelligence Agency, \"Operation Mincemeat\"...(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"BORN TO LEAD\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS #1: (As characters, singing) But we were born to lead.LUNDEN: ...And \"Dead Outlaw,\" about the history of an American wannabe robber in the early 20th century, both before and after his death.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"DEAD\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As character, singing) Your mama's dead.UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character, singing) Your daddy's dead.UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As character, singing) Your brother's dead.UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character, singing) And so are you.LUNDEN: Rounding out the category are \"Buena Vista Social Club,\" based on the lives of the Cuban musicians who recorded the popular 1997 album - that's already getting a special Tony for its live onstage band - and \"Death Becomes Her,\" based on the popular film.DETROW: Let's talk about one really competitive category with some powerhouses in it, leading actress in a musical.LUNDEN: Well, there are five great nominees. Both lead actresses in \"Death Becomes Her\" are up for the award, but most people agree that it's a two- or three-way race. Audra McDonald is up for her record-breaking 11th nomination playing Mama Rose in the revival of \"Gypsy.\"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"EVERYTHING'S COMING UP ROSES\")AUDRA MCDONALD: (As Mama Rose, singing) Honey, everything's coming up roses.LUNDEN: And former Pussycat Doll Nicole Scherzinger is giving a profoundly odd and compelling performance as Norma Desmond in an avant-garde revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber's \"Sunset Boulevard.\"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WITH ONE LOOK\")NICOLE SCHERZINGER: (As Norma Desmond, singing) With one look, I can break your heart.LUNDEN: And finally, if the vote is split, newcomer Jasmine Amy Rogers might win for her frothy performance as Betty Boop in \"BOOP!\"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WHERE I WANNA BE\")JASMINE AMY ROGERS: (As Betty Boop, singing) Yeah, but now that I've come here, it's where I wanna be.LUNDEN: It's almost an embarrassment of riches this year.DETROW: Well, speaking of riches, Jeff, I'm confused because this was the highest-grossing Broadway season ever, but I thought attendance was still down from the pandemic.LUNDEN: Well, it was, but the highest gross came about because of high-ticket prices charged for some shows featuring Hollywood actors, Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal and George Clooney. And their shows made back their investment, but the general outlook on Broadway is a little less rosy. Only 1 in 10 shows is turning a profit because of skyrocketing production costs. But even though the odds are long for investors, with musicals, the hope is to create something that becomes a huge moneymaker, like \"Hamilton\" or \"Wicked,\" which can run for years on Broadway and go on tour.DETROW: Are you feeling any of that \"Wicked\" or \"Hamilton\" energy from any of these new shows?LUNDEN: Not really at the moment, though \"Buena Vista Social Club\" and \"Death Becomes Her\" have already announced tours.

There are two shows based on real historical events which feature corpses in the plot - the English import about a World War II false flag operation run by MI5, the British Intelligence Agency, \"Operation Mincemeat\"...(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"BORN TO LEAD\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS #1: (As characters, singing) But we were born to lead.LUNDEN: ...And \"Dead Outlaw,\" about the history of an American wannabe robber in the early 20th century, both before and after his death.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"DEAD\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As character, singing) Your mama's dead.UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character, singing) Your daddy's dead.UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As character, singing) Your brother's dead.UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character, singing) And so are you.LUNDEN: Rounding out the category are \"Buena Vista Social Club,\" based on the lives of the Cuban musicians who recorded the popular 1997 album - that's already getting a special Tony for its live onstage band - and \"Death Becomes Her,\" based on the popular film.DETROW: Let's talk about one really competitive category with some powerhouses in it, leading actress in a musical.LUNDEN: Well, there are five great nominees. Both lead actresses in \"Death Becomes Her\" are up for the award, but most people agree that it's a two- or three-way race. Audra McDonald is up for her record-breaking 11th nomination playing Mama Rose in the revival of \"Gypsy.\"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"EVERYTHING'S COMING UP ROSES\")AUDRA MCDONALD: (As Mama Rose, singing) Honey, everything's coming up roses.LUNDEN: And former Pussycat Doll Nicole Scherzinger is giving a profoundly odd and compelling performance as Norma Desmond in an avant-garde revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber's \"Sunset Boulevard.\"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WITH ONE LOOK\")NICOLE SCHERZINGER: (As Norma Desmond, singing) With one look, I can break your heart.LUNDEN: And finally, if the vote is split, newcomer Jasmine Amy Rogers might win for her frothy performance as Betty Boop in \"BOOP!\"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WHERE I WANNA BE\")JASMINE AMY ROGERS: (As Betty Boop, singing) Yeah, but now that I've come here, it's where I wanna be.LUNDEN: It's almost an embarrassment of riches this year.DETROW: Well, speaking of riches, Jeff, I'm confused because this was the highest-grossing Broadway season ever, but I thought attendance was still down from the pandemic.LUNDEN: Well, it was, but the highest gross came about because of high-ticket prices charged for some shows featuring Hollywood actors, Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal and George Clooney. And their shows made back their investment, but the general outlook on Broadway is a little less rosy. Only 1 in 10 shows is turning a profit because of skyrocketing production costs. But even though the odds are long for investors, with musicals, the hope is to create something that becomes a huge moneymaker, like \"Hamilton\" or \"Wicked,\" which can run for years on Broadway and go on tour.DETROW: Are you feeling any of that \"Wicked\" or \"Hamilton\" energy from any of these new shows?LUNDEN: Not really at the moment, though \"Buena Vista Social Club\" and \"Death Becomes Her\" have already announced tours. But they'll all get their shot when they do numbers on the Tonys. And speaking of numbers on the Tonys, the original cast of \"Hamilton\" is getting back together to do a song in honor of the show's 10th anniversary.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"MY SHOT\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #3: (As character, singing) Oh, who are you?UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #4: (As character, singing) Who are you?UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #5: (As character, singing) Who are you?UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS #2: (As characters, singing) Ooh, who is this kid?

LUNDEN: ...And \"Dead Outlaw,\" about the history of an American wannabe robber in the early 20th century, both before and after his death.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"DEAD\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As character, singing) Your mama's dead.UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character, singing) Your daddy's dead.UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As character, singing) Your brother's dead.UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character, singing) And so are you.LUNDEN: Rounding out the category are \"Buena Vista Social Club,\" based on the lives of the Cuban musicians who recorded the popular 1997 album - that's already getting a special Tony for its live onstage band - and \"Death Becomes Her,\" based on the popular film.DETROW: Let's talk about one really competitive category with some powerhouses in it, leading actress in a musical.LUNDEN: Well, there are five great nominees. Both lead actresses in \"Death Becomes Her\" are up for the award, but most people agree that it's a two- or three-way race. Audra McDonald is up for her record-breaking 11th nomination playing Mama Rose in the revival of \"Gypsy.\"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"EVERYTHING'S COMING UP ROSES\")AUDRA MCDONALD: (As Mama Rose, singing) Honey, everything's coming up roses.LUNDEN: And former Pussycat Doll Nicole Scherzinger is giving a profoundly odd and compelling performance as Norma Desmond in an avant-garde revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber's \"Sunset Boulevard.\"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WITH ONE LOOK\")NICOLE SCHERZINGER: (As Norma Desmond, singing) With one look, I can break your heart.LUNDEN: And finally, if the vote is split, newcomer Jasmine Amy Rogers might win for her frothy performance as Betty Boop in \"BOOP!\"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WHERE I WANNA BE\")JASMINE AMY ROGERS: (As Betty Boop, singing) Yeah, but now that I've come here, it's where I wanna be.LUNDEN: It's almost an embarrassment of riches this year.DETROW: Well, speaking of riches, Jeff, I'm confused because this was the highest-grossing Broadway season ever, but I thought attendance was still down from the pandemic.LUNDEN: Well, it was, but the highest gross came about because of high-ticket prices charged for some shows featuring Hollywood actors, Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal and George Clooney. And their shows made back their investment, but the general outlook on Broadway is a little less rosy. Only 1 in 10 shows is turning a profit because of skyrocketing production costs. But even though the odds are long for investors, with musicals, the hope is to create something that becomes a huge moneymaker, like \"Hamilton\" or \"Wicked,\" which can run for years on Broadway and go on tour.DETROW: Are you feeling any of that \"Wicked\" or \"Hamilton\" energy from any of these new shows?LUNDEN: Not really at the moment, though \"Buena Vista Social Club\" and \"Death Becomes Her\" have already announced tours. But they'll all get their shot when they do numbers on the Tonys. And speaking of numbers on the Tonys, the original cast of \"Hamilton\" is getting back together to do a song in honor of the show's 10th anniversary.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"MY SHOT\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #3: (As character, singing) Oh, who are you?UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #4: (As character, singing) Who are you?UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #5: (As character, singing) Who are you?UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS #2: (As characters, singing) Ooh, who is this kid?

The authoritative record of NPR’s programming is the audio record. LUNDEN: Well, there are five great nominees. Both lead actresses in \"Death Becomes Her\" are up for the award, but most people agree that it's a two- or three-way race. Audra McDonald is up for her record-breaking 11th nomination playing Mama Rose in the revival of \"Gypsy.\"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"EVERYTHING'S COMING UP ROSES\")AUDRA MCDONALD: (As Mama Rose, singing) Honey, everything's coming up roses.LUNDEN: And former Pussycat Doll Nicole Scherzinger is giving a profoundly odd and compelling performance as Norma Desmond in an avant-garde revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber's \"Sunset Boulevard.\"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WITH ONE LOOK\")NICOLE SCHERZINGER: (As Norma Desmond, singing) With one look, I can break your heart.LUNDEN: And finally, if the vote is split, newcomer Jasmine Amy Rogers might win for her frothy performance as Betty Boop in \"BOOP!\"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WHERE I WANNA BE\")JASMINE AMY ROGERS: (As Betty Boop, singing) Yeah, but now that I've come here, it's where I wanna be.LUNDEN: It's almost an embarrassment of riches this year.DETROW: Well, speaking of riches, Jeff, I'm confused because this was the highest-grossing Broadway season ever, but I thought attendance was still down from the pandemic.LUNDEN: Well, it was, but the highest gross came about because of high-ticket prices charged for some shows featuring Hollywood actors, Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal and George Clooney. And their shows made back their investment, but the general outlook on Broadway is a little less rosy. Only 1 in 10 shows is turning a profit because of skyrocketing production costs. But even though the odds are long for investors, with musicals, the hope is to create something that becomes a huge moneymaker, like \"Hamilton\" or \"Wicked,\" which can run for years on Broadway and go on tour.DETROW: Are you feeling any of that \"Wicked\" or \"Hamilton\" energy from any of these new shows?LUNDEN: Not really at the moment, though \"Buena Vista Social Club\" and \"Death Becomes Her\" have already announced tours. But they'll all get their shot when they do numbers on the Tonys. And speaking of numbers on the Tonys, the original cast of \"Hamilton\" is getting back together to do a song in honor of the show's 10th anniversary.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"MY SHOT\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #3: (As character, singing) Oh, who are you?UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #4: (As character, singing) Who are you?UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #5: (As character, singing) Who are you?UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS #2: (As characters, singing) Ooh, who is this kid?

I'm young, scrappy and hungry, and I'm not throwing away my shot.DETROW: That is NPR's Jeff Lunden. Thank you so much, Jeff.LUNDEN: Thanks, Scott.DETROW: The Tonys, hosted by Cynthia Erivo, are on CBS tomorrow evening.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"MY SHOT\")MIRANDA: (As Alexander Hamilton) I got to holler just to be heard.

NICOLE SCHERZINGER: (As Norma Desmond, singing) With one look, I can break your heart.LUNDEN: And finally, if the vote is split, newcomer Jasmine Amy Rogers might win for her frothy performance as Betty Boop in \"BOOP!\"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WHERE I WANNA BE\")JASMINE AMY ROGERS: (As Betty Boop, singing) Yeah, but now that I've come here, it's where I wanna be.LUNDEN: It's almost an embarrassment of riches this year.DETROW: Well, speaking of riches, Jeff, I'm confused because this was the highest-grossing Broadway season ever, but I thought attendance was still down from the pandemic.LUNDEN: Well, it was, but the highest gross came about because of high-ticket prices charged for some shows featuring Hollywood actors, Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal and George Clooney. And their shows made back their investment, but the general outlook on Broadway is a little less rosy. Only 1 in 10 shows is turning a profit because of skyrocketing production costs. But even though the odds are long for investors, with musicals, the hope is to create something that becomes a huge moneymaker, like \"Hamilton\" or \"Wicked,\" which can run for years on Broadway and go on tour.DETROW: Are you feeling any of that \"Wicked\" or \"Hamilton\" energy from any of these new shows?LUNDEN: Not really at the moment, though \"Buena Vista Social Club\" and \"Death Becomes Her\" have already announced tours. But they'll all get their shot when they do numbers on the Tonys. And speaking of numbers on the Tonys, the original cast of \"Hamilton\" is getting back together to do a song in honor of the show's 10th anniversary.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"MY SHOT\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #3: (As character, singing) Oh, who are you?UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #4: (As character, singing) Who are you?UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #5: (As character, singing) Who are you?UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS #2: (As characters, singing) Ooh, who is this kid?

    "article_text": "Becky Sullivan Coco Gauff celebrates after winning her women's singles final match against Belarus' Aryna Sabalenka at the French Open tennis tournament in Paris on Saturday.Thibuad Moritz/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption Coco Gauff, the 21-year-old American tennis star, has defeated Aryna Sabalenka in the French Open women's singles final to claim the second Grand Slam title of her young career. Saturday's final between Sabalenka and Gauff, who are respectively ranked No. 1 and No. 2 in the world, was the first Grand Slam women's final to feature the world's top two players since 2018. Gauff is the first American champion at the French Open since Serena Williams in 2015. The two players battled over three sets. After Sabalenka won the first set 7-6, Gauff stormed back to dominate the second set, 6-2, before outlasting the Belarusian player 6-4 in a gutsy final set. After Sabalenka's final volley landed just wide of the line, Gauff collapsed to the red clay of Roland-Garros, her hands high in the air. \"I don't think either of us were playing great,\" Gauff said in an interview with TNT after the match. \"But I knew as soon as I stepped on to the court when I felt that it was windy that it would be one of those matches. So I was just trying to give myself the best chance and fight every point.\" Gauff had reached the final after defeating fellow American Madison Keys, No. 7, in the quarterfinal, then breezing past the crowd darling Lois Boisson, the French player ranked just No. 361 who had mounted a thrilling Cinderella run at the Open. On the other side of the bracket was the imposing Sabalenka, who ascended to the world's No. 1 spot last year after winning in Australia and the U.S. Open in New York. Sabalenka had toppled the Polish star Iga Swiatek, winner of the past three consecutive French Opens, in the semifinal. Gauff burst into the tennis world as a teenager — including a juniors title at Roland-Garros in 2018, her first career junior Grand Slam win.

    "title": "Israel says it has retrieved the body of a Thai hostage in Gaza",
    "article_text": "The conflict between Israel and Palestinians — and other groups in the Middle East — goes back decades. These stories provide context for current developments and the history that led up to them. By The Associated Press This undated photo provided by the Hostage's Family Forum shows Nattapong Pinta, with his wife and son.Hostage's Family Forum/APhide caption TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel said Saturday it had retrieved the body of a Thai hostage abducted into Gaza during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that sparked the war, as it continued its military offensive, killing at least 95 people in the past 24 hours, according to Gaza's health ministry. The prime minister's office said Nattapong Pinta's body was returned to Israel in a special military operation. Pinta was seized from Kibbutz Nir Oz and killed early in the war, the government said. Thailand's foreign ministry in a statement confirmed that the last Thai hostage in Gaza was confirmed dead. It said the bodies of two others are yet to be retrieved. The news came two days after the bodies of two Israeli-American hostages were retrieved. Fifty-five hostages remain in Gaza, and Israel says more than half are dead. Israel's defense minister said Pinta's body was retrieved from the Rafah area in southern Gaza. He had come to Israel to work in agriculture. The army said he was seized by the Mujahideen Brigades, the small armed group that it said also abducted and killed Shiri Bibas and her two small children. The same group took the two Israeli-American hostages, Judih Weinstein and Gad Haggai, whose bodies were retrieved Thursday. Thais were the largest group of foreigners held captive by Hamas militants. Many of the agricultural workers lived in compounds on the outskirts of southern Israeli kibbutzim and towns, and Hamas militants overran those places first. A total of 46 Thais have been killed during the conflict, according to Thailand's foreign ministry. Separately, Hamas issued an unusual warning about another hostage, Matan Zangauker, saying Israel's military had surrounded the area where he is held and that any harm to him during a rescue attempt would be Israel's responsibility. Israel continued its military offensive across Gaza. Four strikes hit the Muwasi area in southern Gaza between Rafah and Khan Younis. In northern Gaza, one strike hit an apartment, killing seven people including a mother and five children. Their bodies were taken to Shifa hospital \"Stand up, my love,\" one weeping woman said, touching the shrouded bodies. Another strike in Gaza City killed six members of a family, including two children, according to the Shifa and al-Ahli hospitals. Israel said it was responding to Hamas' \"barbaric attacks\" and dismantling its capabilities. It said it takes all feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm. Staff at Nasser hospital, where six of the bodies over the past 24 hours were taken, said they were killed while on their way to get food aid. Much of Gaza's population of over 2 million now relies on such aid after widespread destruction of agriculture and markets as well as a recent Israeli blockade of two and a half months. Experts have warned of famine in the territory. Israel's army said that despite warnings that the distribution area is an active combat zone during nighttime hours, several suspects attempted to approach troops operating in the Tel al-Sultan area overnight \"in a manner that posed a threat to the troops.\" The army said troops called out, but as the suspects continued advancing, they fired warning shots. An army official who couldn't be named in line with military procedures said the shots were fired about one kilometer (half a mile) from the aid distribution site. Shootings have occurred frequently near the new hubs where thousands of desperate Palestinians are being directed to collect food. The hubs are run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a new group of mainly American contractors. Israel wants the GHF to replace humanitarian groups in Gaza that distribute aid in coordination with the United Nations. Israel accuses Hamas of siphoning off aid under the U.N.-led system. The U.N. and aid groups deny there is significant diversion of aid to militants and say the new system — which they have rejected — allows Israel to use food as a weapon, violates humanitarian principles and won't be effective. It was unclear if the GHF sites opened on Saturday. Separately, Palestinians lined up at a soup kitchen in Gaza City for handouts on the second day of Eid al-Adha. \"I have been standing here for more than an hour and a half. I feel I have a sunstroke, and I am in need,\" said the waiting Farida al-Sayed, who said she had six people to feed. \"I only had lentils, and I ran out of them.\" Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the October 2023 attack and abducted 251 hostages. Most were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages and recovered dozens of bodies. Israel's military campaign has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's health ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. The offensive has destroyed large parts of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population of roughly 2 million Palestinians. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "A former police chief who escaped from an Arkansas prison is captured",
    "article_text": "By The Associated Press This combo of images released by the Arkansas Department of Corrections shows the recapture of escaped inmate Grant Hardin, an ex-police chief and convicted killer, by Arkansas law enforcement officers and the U.S. Border Patrol on Friday, near Moccasin Creek in Izard County, about 1.5 miles northwest of Calico Rock prison.Arkansas Department of Corrections/APhide caption A former police chief and convicted killer known as the \"Devil in the Ozarks\" was captured by law enforcement 1.5 miles northwest of the prison he escaped from followinga massive, nearly two-week-long manhuntin the rugged mountains of northern Arkansas, authorities announced Friday. Grant Hardin, a former police chief in the small town of Gateway near the Arkansas-Missouri border, was serving lengthy sentences for murder and rape. Eventually, his notoriety led to a TV documentary, \"Devil in the Ozarks.\" Hardin briefly attempted to run from officers when he saw them approach Friday afternoon, but he was quickly tackled to the ground, said Rand Champion, a spokesperson for the Arkansas prison system. \"He'd been on the run for a week and a half and probably didn't have any energy left in him,\" he added. Hardin's identity was confirmed through fingerprinting, the Izard County Sheriff's Office said in a Facebook post. There's no indication that Hardin was injured, though he will be checked for dehydration and other medical problems. Now, investigators are \"chomping at the bit and really ready to talk to him,\" said Champion, who used his cellphone to capture an image of Hardin being led away by officers. Hardin said nothing during those moments. Hardin had been held at the Calico Rock prison since 2017 after pleading guilty to first-degree murder in a fatal shooting. In order to escape, he impersonated a corrections officer \"in dress and manner,\" according to a court document. A prison officer in one of the guard towers opened a secure gate, allowing him to walk out of the facility. Champion said that someone should have checked Hardin's identity before he was allowed to leave, describing the lack of verification as a \"lapse\" that's being investigated. Searchers had been using bloodhounds, officers on horseback, drones and helicopters in their hunt for Hardin since he escaped on May 25. Shortly after the escape, a bloodhound found — then quickly lost — Hardin's scent when heavy rains blew through the area, Champion said. The bloodhound tracked Hardin's path for less than a quarter of a mile, after which could have gone in any direction. \"That was one of the most frustrating things, that they were able to track him but then they lost him because of the rain,\" Champion said. An elite and highly trained U.S. Border Patrol team had recently joined the search, federal authorities announced this week. The Border Patrol Tactical Team provided \"advanced search capabilities and operational support,\" U.S. Customs and Border Protection said. Its members are experienced in navigating complex terrain, the agency said earlier this week. The team tracked Hardin through the region known for its rocky and rugged landscape, thick forests and an extensive cave network. U.S. Customs and Border Patrol shared photos on Facebook of Hardin shirtless and covered in mud, laying face down with his hands tied behind his back on Friday. The post said that Hardin was \"turned over to Arkansas State Police unharmed\" by the federal agency. A spokesperson for the agency didn't respond to a phone call and emailed request for comment regarding the post on Friday night. Hardin pleaded guilty in 2017 to first-degree murder for the killing of James Appleton, 59. Appleton worked for the Gateway water department when he was shot in the head Feb. 23, 2017, near Garfield. Police found Appleton's body inside a car. Hardin was sentenced to 30 years in prison. Hardin's DNA was also matched to the 1997 rape of a teacher at an elementary school in Rogers, north of Fayetteville. He was sentenced to 50 years for that crime. Cheryl Tillman, Appleton's sister, was with her mother and sister at a flea market in Ozark, Missouri, when law enforcement called to tell her Hardin had been captured. Tillman is also the mayor of Gateway, the 450-person town where Hardin was briefly police chief. Tillman told The Associated Press that Hardin's capture was a \"big sigh of relief\" for her whole family. \"We don't have to walk around, turning around all the time, thinking somebody's on our back,\" Tillman said, emphasizing her appreciation for the officers who helped capture Hardin. Though Hardin was police chief in Gateway for just four months, he had served as an officer in multiple communities around northwest Arkansas, his police records show. In his first job as a police officer 35 years ago in Fayetteville, Hardin struggled almost immediately, his supervisors said. He was dismissed by Fayetteville police, but kept getting hired for other law enforcement jobs in northwest Arkansas over the years. Hardin worked about six months at the Huntsville Police Department before resigning, but records do not give a reason for his resignation. He later worked at the Eureka Springs Police Department from 1993 to 1996. Former Chief Earl Hyatt said Hardin resigned because Hyatt was going to fire him over incidents that included the use of excessive force. \"He did not need to be a police officer at all,\" Hyatt told television station KNWA. By the time he was the police chief in Gateway in 2016, \"he was out chasing cars for no reason,\" Tillman recalled in the documentary \"Devil in the Ozarks.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "The many ways Ukraine carries out unprecedented drone attacks",
    "article_text": "The roots of Russia's invasion of Ukraine go back decades and run deep. The current conflict is more than one country fighting to take over another; it is — in the words of one U.S. official — a shift in \"the world order.\"Here are some helpful stories to make sense of it all. Greg Myre Ukrainian troops prepare to launch a drone in eastern Ukraine on April 30. Throughout the war, Ukraine has carried out innovative drone attacks never seen before in combat.Genya Savilov/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption Ukraine's recent attack on Russian warplanes was audacious, innovative and unprecedented. Ukraine's stealthy strike was carried out with small drones, hidden in trucks parked near several Russian air bases. Yet Operation Spider's Web, orchestrated by the SBU intelligence service, was also part of a recurring theme: Ukraine keeps inventing new ways to wage war with drones, and regularly catches Russia by surprise. \"The Ukrainians are the ones innovating and trying these daring and creative attacks. And then the Russians are left scrambling to figure out how to defend against it, and prevent another one,\" saidKelly Grieco, who studies the air war at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington. Ukraine has also pioneered the use of drones in the waters of the Black Sea. Last month, a Ukrainian sea drone shot down a Russian warplane — the first time this type of attack has been recorded. Michael Kofman, with Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, often travels to Ukraine and is always struck by the pace of change in drone warfare. \"My experience, going back to Ukraine numerous times during this war, this typically evolves around every 3 to 4 months,\" said Kofman. Ukraine pioneered sea drones a couple of years ago. They were essentially jet skis packed with explosives and guided by remote control. Those drones — and more sophisticated models that followed — proved so effective that Russian warships no longer venture anywhere near Ukraine's Black Sea coast.

(Photo by SERGEY BOBOK / AFP) (Photo by SERGEY BOBOK/AFP via Getty Images)SERGEY BOBOK/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption Ukraine's drones are also creating huge problems for Russia's ground forces. When the troops gather in large numbers for an operation, Ukrainian drones are virtually certain to spot them and attack. \"It is becoming harder to move because drones are providing eyes on the battlefield,\" said Grieco. \"It's not just being seen, but it's also very quickly you're able to act on it. You find lots of people saying, 'If you move on the battlefield in Ukraine, you're dead.'\" Russia has many more troops than Ukraine and is gaining ground incrementally. But Michael Kofman says Ukraine's drones play a critical role in limiting this Russian advantage. \"They add a huge force multiplier,\" said Kofman. \"This makes it such that the Russian advances on the battlefield come at a very high cost.\" In the early days of the war, artillery caused most of the deaths and injuries. Now, he says, it's drones. \"I think it became quite clear [last year] that drones were starting to be responsible for a higher share of the battlefield casualties,\" he said. Ukrainian officials say drones inflict around70 percentof the casualties suffered by both militaries. A Ukrainian firefighter responds to a drone strike in the northeastern city of Kharkiv on Thursday. Both sides have ramped up drone attacks. Russia has fired more than 400 drones at Ukraine on two separate nights in the past week, the largest numbers in the war.OLEKSANDR MAGULA/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption The Russians began the war with a limited drone arsenal. But as the Ukrainians hammered them, the Russians realized they needed help — and fast. \"There is a history between the Russians and the Iranians in regards to collaboration on military items,\" saidOmar al-Ghusbi, with theCenter for Advanced Defense Studies, a Washington research institute. He just wrote a detailed report on theRussia-Iran drone partnership. Early in the war, the Russians began buying an Iranian drone, the Shahed 136. The Iranian model is considered serviceable, but with limitations. It's propeller driven, relatively loud and slow, and sometimes described as a lawnmower in the sky. But the main problem was Iran wasn't making nearly as many as Russia wanted. So Russia paid Iran for the technology, and began making a Russian version domestically, known as the Geran. \"The most groundbreaking, revolutionary thing about the Geran is the mass production capability as well as the capability of striking targets at a long range,\" said al-Ghusbi. Ukraine says it made more than 1 million drones last year and plans to build well over2 million this year.The Russians have not offered numbers, butUkrainian officials sayRussia is catching up quickly and is likely to produce a similar number. On many nights, both countries now unleash more than 100 attack drones at each other. In the past week,  Russia has fired more than400 dronesat Ukraine on two separate nights — the largest numbers recorded by either side. Both sides shoot down, or electronically jam, most incoming drones. But even if 10 or 20 percent get through, they can cause extensive damage. This is especially true in Ukraine, where many Russian drones strike civilian areas. \"I think it is overwhelming Ukraine's defensive systems,\" said al-Ghusbi. \"If you're launching hundreds of drones, that requires a lot of people on a lot of different weapons systems monitoring the skies.\" Before this war, drones were expensive, high-end hardware with a few specialized uses, but were not the main battlefield weapon. Now, they're cheap, disposable, mass-produced weapons reshaping the Russia-Ukraine war — and many more conflicts yet to come. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Should federal rental aid come with a time limit? Here's how it works in one place",
    "article_text": "Jennifer Ludden Becca Morris in the home she's in the process of buying in Harrington, Delaware, on May 14, 2026. She found it just a few months before her federal housing subsidy was set to end.Wesley LaPointe/for NPRhide caption When Becca Morris applied for a federal housing subsidy years ago, her life was in turmoil. She'd had a son at age 19, the father was in and out of rehab and prison, and she was couch surfing with friends and family. Morris wasn't fazed when the offer of rental aid came with a major condition: That money would end after seven years, max. \"I feel like this was … good pressure,\" she says. A push to do better and go back to school and \"to do what I need to do.\" Thanks to that subsidy, she and her son live in a small two-bedroom home in Bridgeville, Del. Blue light dances on the ceiling from two large aquariums, there are plants everywhere, and photos of her now 13-year old adorn the fridge. It is cozy but cramped, and Morris is eager for more space. And that seven-year cutoff? It's actually come and gone, partly because of the COVID pandemic. But it turns out this program is about a lot more than a ticking time limit. The house on the right is where Becca Morris and her son live in Bridgeville, Del. The state has one of the few housing authorities in the country with the power to impose a time limit and work requirement in exchange for a housing subsidy.Wesley LaPointe/for NPRhide caption Only a small number of local housing authorities currently have the power to impose things like a time limit, if they choose. TheDelaware State Housing Authority, which serves two counties in the state, is one of them. But the Department of Housing and Urban Developmentis working on a ruleto vastly expand that power, not only for time limits, but also work requirements, according to an internal document seen by NPR. HUD declined to confirm the plan or provide details. But an agency spokeswoman noted that President Trump's budget proposal included a two-year time limit for rental aid and said it would help people \"achieve self-sufficiency and economic independence.\" Housing policy experts say there'slittle evidencethat time limits orwork requirementsboost employment or help people move off subsidies. And they worry many people could face harsh consequences at a time when rent prices remain out of reach for a large share of Americans. Becca Morris, in her living room, calls the time limit on her housing subsidy  \"good pressure.\"Wesley LaPointe/for NPRhide caption The \"good pressure\" Morris says she felt from the Delaware program included a requirement to work. Those who are elderly or disabled are exempt, but otherwise it applies to every adult member of a household unless they're in school or training. There were also regular meetings to make sure she was on track financially. Plus — and this is key — the Delaware State Housing Authority helped Morris save money. For most people with housing subsidies, if their income goes up their rent does, too. But not with the Delaware program. Monthly payments stay flat, so people can save over time. And the extra money they would have paid toward rent goes into an interest-bearing savings account, which they can access when they leave. Morris says she never could have done that on her own. \"I would have been literally paycheck to paycheck this entire time. How would I have saved any money without having to work like seven days a week, 24 hours?\" she says. Photos of family members, including Becca Morris' son, Jayden, decorate a bulletin board in her bedroom.Wesley LaPointe/for NPRhide caption There's also a two-tiered time limit. If people are able to move on within five years, they get all the money in their savings account. If not, there's a two-year buffer that comes with a penalty. Morris needed that extra time, so she'll only get part of her savings. But she feels it still makes sense financially. \"I was able to save more staying here with the lower rent,\" she says. And there was more wiggle room with her deadline. In addition to getting an extra year because of the pandemic, she was granted extra time after she injured her wrist and couldn't work for a while. She's also grateful she got a break on rent — paying just $50 — when she had to stop working for more than a year so she could finish up a nursing degree. The kitchen in Becca Morris' home. She was able to stop working for more than a year — and get a break on her rent — to complete a nursing degree.Wesley LaPointe/for NPRhide caption Now, after nine years living here, Morris and her son are finally getting ready to move out. \"Yes, the stars align to the grace of God,\" she says, \"everything worked out perfectly.\" Only a quarter of people who qualify for rental assistance are able to get it, and that's a driving factor for supporters of time limits. \"Once you get a housing subsidy, it's for life. So as a result of that, there are extremely long waiting lists,\" says Howard Husock, a senior fellow in domestic policy at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute. Themedian length of stayon federal housing assistance is around four to five years, according to one recent study, though Husock says many people stay more than a decade. \"The system is kind of all backed up and so that's thelogic of a time limit,\" he says. \"Not to punish people, but to encourage turnover, encourage upward mobility and to make way for people who are in need who are not being served.\" A water tower stands above downtown Bridgeville, Del. A number of other local housing authorities have ended time limits, after finding that renters' incomes didn't increase enough to afford market-rate housing.Wesley LaPointe/for NPRhide caption But time limits have not worked out well everywhere. In Washington state, the Tacoma Housing Authority imposed a five-year maximum back in 2013. Then, even those with decent jobs struggled as rents started skyrocketing. \"People are working, they're working really hard. They're just not able to get ahead because housing is so expensive compared to what they're being paid,\" says April Black, the housing authority's executive director. She says it was impossible for people to save money, and as the five-year deadlines came due, there was heartburn about cutting people off. \"We're here to house people, and there was no way that we were going to exit people from a program knowing that they would become homeless,\" Black says. Tacoma did its own analysis and found that people with a regular housing voucher, and no time limit, actually fared better at increasing their incomes and moving on. Theyended the time limitin 2022. Morris' street in Bridgeville. The head of the Delaware State Housing Authority says a time limit gives renters a sense of urgency but an automatic savings plan and other support is what really helps them get ahead and move on.Wesley LaPointe/for NPRhide caption At the Delaware State Housing Authority, Director Matthew Heckles agrees that the severe lack of affordable housing complicates the case for time limits. He also echoes others who say the two-year time limit in Trump's budget proposal isn't at all realistic. \"I don't think we have very many, if any, families that … graduate after two years,\" he says. But given the success he's seen in Delaware, Heckles still thinks it makes sense to try and scale time limits nationally. \"I think it comes with a big caveat, though. The reason that people are successful is not because there's a time limit,\" he says. Yes, it adds urgency. But what really makes the difference are the interest-bearing savings accounts, he says, which grow to about $7,000 on average, plus all the other extra support. That can be in the form of help with budgeting or with finding child care or health insurance. Once, when a lot of tenants worked at the same place, \"we ran a bus essentially from point A to point B so people could get to work,\" he says. After moving on, Heckles says many people still need other kinds of low-income housing. But others do make it without subsidies, and some have even been able to buy their own place. Becca Morris stands on the front porch of her future home, in Harrington, Delaware.Wesley LaPointe/for NPRhide caption That includes Becca Morris, who drives to a nearby town and parks in the muddy backyard of a two-story house under construction. \"Well, here we are, my new home!\" she says. Morris looked for a place for two years, thinking older houses would be cheaper, but she kept getting outbid. It was nerve-wracking, with just a few months before her deadline. Then she found this place, already being built but not yet sold. She walks by wood stud walls as she points out the rooms. \"I cannot wait to do laundry in my own house,\" she says at the top of the stairs. \"And that sounds crazy, but I am super thrilled about that.\" Morris knows it will be tight, and she'll have to work more to pay the mortgage. She's confident she can make it work, but says it still feels overwhelming. \"Come moving in is when it'll really, like, hit me,\" she says. \"Wow, I did this.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "4 takeaways from Erin Patterson's testimony at her toxic mushroom triple murder trial",
    "article_text": "By Rachel Treisman Erin Patterson, pictured at her home in Leongatha, Victoria, Australia, in August 2023. Three people died of death cap poisoning after eating a meal she had cooked the previous month.Jason Edwards/Newspix via Getty Imageshide caption The Australian woman accused of killing her estranged husband's elderly relatives with toxic mushrooms in a home-cooked meal is sharing her story — and dropping bombshells — during multiple days of testimony in court. Erin Patterson, 50, is accused of intentionally putting death cap mushrooms — which are among themost poisonousin the world — in a beef Wellington dish she served at a July 2023 lunch at her home in the small town of Leongatha, some 85 miles from Melbourne. All four of her guests — her husband's parents, aunt and uncle — were hospitalized with gastrointestinal symptoms the following day, and three of them died the following week from altered liver function and multiple organ failure due to Amanita mushroom poisoning. Patterson was briefly hospitalized but did not have the same symptoms as her guests. She testified that she vomited later that day after eating two-thirds of a cake they had brought. Patterson, a mother of two, denies that the poisoning was deliberate and has pleaded not guilty to three counts of murder and one count of attempted murder. She faces life imprisonment if convicted. As Patterson's triple murder trial in the Victoria state Supreme Court unfolds, she has admitted to lying about certain details of her story — such as the cancer diagnosis she invited her guests over to tell them about, her previously undisclosed mushroom foraging hobby and the fact that she had owned a food dehydrator but quickly disposed of it during the investigation. \"Even after you were discharged from hospital you did not tell a single person that there may have been foraged mushroom used in the meal,\" prosecutor Nanette Rogers asked her Friday. \"Instead you got up, you drove your children to school ... and drove home. And then you got rid of the dehydrator.\" \"Correct,\" Patterson replied. The trial, which began in April, was initially expected to take around six weeks. Justice Christopher Beale said Thursday there are several more steps in the proceedings, potentially including hearing new evidence, before the jury is sequestered for deliberations. \"And then the boot is on the other foot, because none of you can tell me how long you will be in deliberations,\" Beale said. \"How long is a piece of string? You will take all the time you need.\" Here are some of the biggest takeaways from Patterson's week on the stand. Erin and Simon Patterson got married in 2007 and, after splitting and reconciling multiple times over the years, separated permanently in 2015. They remained amicable and in close contact, sharing custody of their two children, seeing each other in church and even going on vacations together. Simon was invited to the fateful lunch but declined the invitation the night before. Patterson was also on good terms with her in-laws, Gail and Donald Patterson, both 70, saying in court that \"they treated me like their own daughter.\" But prosecutors — and Patterson herself — acknowledged that her relationship with Simon started deteriorating in 2022. Patterson said after noticing that he described himself as single on his tax return, she asked him to start paying child support, which he did. But they continued to fight over related issues, including which school their kids should attend and who should pay the fees. On Thursday, Rogers asked Patterson to read from Signal messages she had sent to Donald and Gail about the disputed school fees. Patterson denied that she was asking her in-laws to make Simon pay for them. \"What I wanted from them, whether I communicated it well or not, was I wanted Don and Gail to help Simon and I communicate better about it,\" Patterson said. \"I thought that … if Simon knew that Don and Gail knew how he was behaving, he might change his behaviour.\" But Don and Gail took Simon's side, which prosecutors allege made Patterson angry. On Friday, the prosecution asked Patterson about Facebook messages she sent to friends in late 2022 complaining about Simon's parents, including: \"Don messaged to say he and Gail don't want to get involved in the financial things but just hope we will pray for the kids,\" alongside what she disputes was an eye-rolling emoji. Elsewhere, she wrote, \"'This family I swear to f****** god.\" \"'I thought his parents would want him to do the right thing but it seems their concern about not wanting to feel uncomfortable and not wanting to get involved in their sons personal matters are overriding that so f*** em,\" read another message. Under questioning, Patterson denied that the messages reflected her true feelings about Don and Gail, and said she was simply \"venting.\" But Rogers accused her of having \"two faces: a public face of appearing to have a good relationship with Don and Gail\" and a private face reflected in her Facebook messages. \"Are you asking me to agree if I had two faces?\" Patterson replied, before answering, \"I had a good relationship with Don and Gail.\" Flowers rest on the grave site for Don and Gail Patterson at the Korumburra General Cemetery during their daughter-in-law's trial in May 2025.Asanka Ratnayake/Getty Imageshide caption Prosecutors say Patterson invited Don and Gail Patterson, as well as Gail's sister Heather Wilkinson, 66, and her husband Ian Wilkinson, 68, over for lunch to discuss some medical issues she was facing and how to break the news to her kids (whom she dropped off for lunch and a movie with a friend before her guests arrived). Based on accounts from Ian Wilkinson, the sole survivor, Patterson told the group at lunch that she had been diagnosed with cancer after noticing a bump on her elbow, and asked for advice on whether to tell her kids. In court on Thursday, Patterson acknowledged that she had misled Gail about the lump on her elbow in the weeks before the lunch, and didn't have medical issues to communicate either to her guests or her kids. \"I didn't have a legitimate medical reason, no, that's true,\" Patterson said. When asked directly, Patterson repeatedly denied telling her lunch guests that she had cancer — contradicting Wilkinson's version of events. But she admitted that at the end of the lunch, \"I'm not proud of this, but I led them to believe that I might be needing some treatment,\" following up on a previous ovarian cancer scare. \"I can't remember the precise words, but I do know what I was trying to communicate was that I was undergoing investigations around ovarian cancer and might need treatment in that regard in the future,\" she said. \"I can't say that that was the specific words I used, but that's what I remember wanting to communicate.\" Patterson said she had long struggled with low self-esteem because of her weight and had made an appointment for that September to look into gastric bypass surgery. \"I was really embarrassed about it, so I thought perhaps letting them believe I had some serious issue that needed treatment might mean they'd be able to help me with the logistics around the kids and I wouldn't have to tell them the real reason,\" she said. Rogers suggested that Patterson never planned to account for her cancer lie \"because you thought that the lunch guests would die,\" to which Patterson replied, \"That's not true.\" Patterson said Tuesday that she accepts there must have been death cap mushrooms in the meal she made, an admission she had long withheld. In the immediate aftermath of the incident, Patterson told doctors and investigators that she used two kinds of mushrooms for her dish: fresh from the grocery store and dried from a Chinese grocer in the area, though she couldn't remember which one. In interviews with police, she denied owning a dehydrator and foraging for mushrooms. On the opening day of the trial, however, her lawyer, Colin Mandy, confirmed those had been lies, but said Patterson \"denies that she ever deliberately sought out death cap mushrooms.\" Patterson said on the stand that she started foraging for mushrooms at trails and botanical gardens in her area in early 2020, and joined Facebook groups to identify and learn about the different kinds. The Victorian governmentissued a warningin early 2023 that death cap mushrooms were growing in the region. Patterson repeatedly said she couldn't remember using the naturalist website that marked where the toxic mushrooms had been found. Patterson acknowledged buying a food dehydrator in April 2023, but denied prosecutors' allegation that she traveled to a nearby town to collect death cap mushrooms that same month. She admitted to disposing of the device after the lunch, but said she didn't know death cap mushrooms had been in it. She said while she was preparing the beef Wellington — which is typically coated in mushroom paste and wrapped in pastry — \"it seemed a little bland to me, so I decided to put in the dried mushrooms that I'd bought from the grocer that I still had in the pantry.\" \"I didn't deliberately put death cap mushrooms in the meal,\" Patterson said, but acknowledged she now thinks there was a chance that some of her foraged mushrooms were also in that Tupperware. She said the possibility only occurred to her days later, as her relatives' conditions deteriorated and toxicology tests confirmed death cap mushroom poisoning. She said she was talking to Simon in the hospital when the topic of her dehydrator came up, and he asked: \"Is that how you poisoned my parents?\" She said his comment got her thinking about how she had dried foraged mushrooms in it weeks earlier. \"I was starting to think, 'What if they'd gone in the container with the Chinese mushrooms? Maybe that had happened,' \" Patterson said, adding it made her feel \"really worried because Child Protection were involved and Simon seemed to be of the mind that maybe this was intentional. I just got really scared.\" Media crews assemble outside Latrobe Valley Magistrates' Court in May.Martin Keep/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption Prosecutors said that even as doctors confirmed the patients were suffering from \"serious toxin syndrome caused by ingestion of amanita phalloides mushrooms,\" they did not immediately receive the antidote because there was a lack of evidence to confirm they had ingested such mushrooms. On Friday, Patterson confirmed she did not tell anyone about the possibility of the contaminated mushrooms. Rogers asked why she didn't alert medical authorities as soon as it occurred to her, on Aug. 1. \"I had been told that people were getting treatment for possible death cap mushroom poisoning,\" Patterson answered. \"So that was already happening.\" Instead, she confirmed that the next day she drove her kids to school, came home and got rid of the dehydrator, taking it to what's called a tip — a second-hand store at a waste facility. Heather Wilkinson and Gail Patterson died on Aug. 4, and Donald Patterson died the following day. Ian Wilkison was extubated on Aug. 14 and discharged to rehab on Sept. 11. She said she disposed of the dehydrator \"in the context of thinking that maybe mushrooms that I'd foraged, or the meal I prepared was responsible for making people sick,\" and that after she learned of the deaths, \"it was this stupid, knee-jerk reaction to just dig deeper and keep lying.\" \"I was just scared, but I shouldn't have done it,\" she added. Patterson also said she did a factory reset of her cell phone during the police investigation because \"I knew that there were photos in there of mushrooms and the dehydrator and I just panicked and didn't want [detectives] to see them.\" That didn't stop prosecutors from showing photos taken on her phone in April 2023, depicting wild mushrooms being weighed on a scale. They suggested Patterson had done so to calculate a lethal dose, which she denied. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Torture and treason trials: what's happening in Tanzania?",
    "article_text": "By Kate Bartlett Kenyan journalist and human rights activist Boniface Mwangi (R) and Ugandan activist Agather Atuhaire (L) during a joint press conference in Nairobi on June 2, 2025 following their three-day detention and alleged torture by Tanzanian authorities.Tony Karumba/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption JOHANNESBURG —At a packedpress conferencethis week two East African activists  wiped away tears as they detailed their alleged sexual assault and torture while in detention in Tanzania. Kenyan activist Boniface Mwangi and Ugandan activist Agather Atuhaire -  who was given an\"International Woman of Courage\"award by the US State Department last year - said they had traveled to neighboring Tanzania in mid-May to monitor the \"sham\" court case of an opposition leader there. They allege they were both subsequently detained by a state security official and men in plain clothes. Mwangidescribed in graphic detailhow he was stripped naked, hung upside down from a metal pole and sexually assaulted with a number of objects. He says while this was going on his was made to shout phrases praising Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan — the country's first female president who is expected to seek re-election in October. \"The pain cut so deep that l couldn't even cry, but screamed in excruciating pain,\" Mwangi told the press conference. His colleague Atuhaire was taken into the different room and raped. The two activists were eventually dumped near the border. Tanzanian policehave rejected the activists' account. TheUS Department of State's Bureau of Africa Affairs has expressed concern over the activists' alleged treatment. The trial Mwangi and Atuhaire had gone to Tanzania to attend a court hearing of Tanzanian opposition leader Tundu Lissu, leader of the CHADEMA party. Lissu — who survived being shot 16 times in a 2017 assassination attempt — was arrested in April on treason charges. His arrest comes ahead of Tanzania's general elections scheduled for October. CHADEMA is already barred from contesting the polls and Lissu had been holding rallies around the country before his arrest under the slogan: \"No reforms, no elections.\" His American lawyer, Robert Amsterdam, told NPR in an interview that the opposition leader faces the death penalty if convicted of treason. He said the charges were \"completely bogus.\" \"The reason they've charged him with treason is that its non-bailable, and this is a common ploy in Tanzanian election politics, to instrumentalize the courts to bar your opponents,\" the lawyer said. \"We demean the concepts of courts and justice when we talk about the kind of trials that are happening in East Africa,\" added Amsterdam, who has also represented Ugandan popstar-turned-opposition leader Bobi Wine. Asked if the activists who'd gone to support Lissu would bring cases of their own, Amsterdam said he would be speaking to Mwangi about that possibility. When Tanzanian President Hassan succeeded authoritarian leader John Magufuli in 2021, she ushered in a number of reforms, including ending bans on political rallies, repealing repressive laws around the media, and releasing Lissu's CHADEMA predecessor from prison. After the oppressive rule of Magufuli — who was nicknamed \"the Bulldozer\" — many Tanzanians were hopeful the country was on a more democratic path. But ahead of local elections last November, analysts say Hassan's government started its own crackdown. CHADEMA official Ali Kibao was abducted and murdered in September, and hundreds of the party's officials were detained ahead of a planned rally. Amnesty Internationalis among the rights groups that have condemned the crackdown on the opposition. \"The authorities' campaign of repression saw four government critics forcibly disappeared, and one unlawfully killed in 2024,\" the human rights watchdog said. \"The police have also prevented opposition members from holding meetings and other political gatherings, subjecting them to mass arrest, arbitrary detention and unlawful use of force.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "The nine-armed octopus and the oddities of the cephalopod nervous system",
    "article_text": "A mix of autonomous and top-down control manage the octopus's limbs. With their quick-change camouflage and high level of intelligence, it’s not surprising that the public and scientific experts alikeare fascinatedby octopuses. Their abilities torecognize faces,solve puzzles,andlearn behaviorsfrom other octopuses make these animals a captivating study. To perform these processes and others, like crawling or exploring, octopuses rely on their complex nervous system, one that has become a focus for neuroscientists. With about500 million neurons—around the same numberas dogs—octopuses’ nervous systems are themost complexof any invertebrate. But, unlike vertebrate organisms, the octopus’s nervous system is also decentralized, with around350 million neurons, or 66 percent of it, located in its eight arms. “This means each arm is capable of independently processing sensory input, initiating movement, and even executing complex behaviors—without direct instructions from the brain,” explainsGalit Pelled, a professor of Mechanical Engineering, Radiology, and Neuroscience at Michigan State University who studies octopus neuroscience. “In essence, the arms have their own ‘mini-brains.’” A decentralized nervous system is one factor that helps octopuses adapt to changes, such as injury or predation, as seen in the case of anOctopus vulgaris, or common octopus, thatwas observedwith nine arms by researchers at the ECOBAR lab at the Institute of Marine Research in Spain between 2021 and 2022. By studying outliers like this cephalopod, researchers cangain insightinto how the animal’s detailed scaffolding of nerves changes and regrows over time, uncovering more about how octopuses have evolved over millennia in our oceans. Because each arm of an octopus contains its own bundle of neurons, the limbs can operatesemi-independentlyfrom the central brain, enabling faster responses since signals don’t always need to travel back and forth between the brain and the arms. In fact, Pelled and her teamrecently discoveredthat “neural signals recorded in the octopus arm can predict movement type within 100 milliseconds of stimulation, without central brain involvement.” She notes that “that level of localized autonomy is unprecedented in vertebrate systems.” Though each limb moves on its own, the movements of the octopus’s body are smooth and conducted with a coordinated elegance that allows the animal to exhibit some of the broadest range of behaviors, adapting on the fly to changes in its surroundings. “That means the octopus can react quickly to its environment, especially when exploring, hunting, or defending itself,” Pelled says. “For example, one arm can grab food while another is feeling around a rock, without needing permission from the brain. This setup also makes the octopus more resilient. If one arm is injured, the others still work just fine. And because so much decision-making happens at the arms, the central brain is freed up to focus on the bigger picture—like navigating or learning new tasks.” As if each limb weren’t already buzzing with neural activity, things get even more intricate when researchers zoom in further—tothe nerveswithin each individual sucker, a ring of muscular tissue, which octopuses use to sense and taste their surroundings. “There is asucker ganglion, or nerve center, located in the stalk of every sucker. For some species of octopuses, that’s over a thousand ganglia,” saysCassady Olson, a graduate student at the University of Chicago who works withCliff Ragsdale, a leading expert in octopus neuroscience. Given that each sucker has its own nerve centers—connected by along axial nerve cordrunning down the limb—and each arm has hundreds of suckers, things get complicated very quickly, as researchers have historically struggled to study thisperipheral nervous system, as it’s called, within the octopus’s body. “The large size of the brain makes it both really exciting to study and really challenging,” saysZ. Yan Wang, an assistant professor of biology and psychology at the University of Washington. “Many of the tools available for neuroscience have to be adjusted or customized specifically for octopuses and other cephalopods because of their unique body plans.” While each limb acts independently, signals are transmitted back to the octopus’s central nervous system. The octopus’ brain sitsbetween its eyesat the front of its mantle, or head, couched between its two optic lobes, large bean-shaped neural organs that help octopuses see the world around them. Theseoptic lobesare just two of theover 30 lobesexperts study within the animal’s centralized brain, as each lobe helps the octopus process its environment. This elaborate neural architecture is critical given the octopus’s dual role in the ecosystem as both predator and prey. Without natural defenses like a hard shell, octopuses have evolved ahighly adaptable nervous systemthat allows them to rapidly process information and adjust as needed, helping their chances of survival. While the octopus’s decentralized nervous system makes it a unique evolutionary example, it does have some structuressimilar toor analogous to the human nervous system. “The octopus has a central brain mass located between its eyes, and an axial nerve cord running down each arm (similar to a spinal cord),” says Wang. “The octopus has many sensory systems that we are familiar with, such as vision, touch (somatosensation), chemosensation, and gravity sensing.” Neuroscientists have homed in on these similarities to understand how these structures may have evolved across the different branches in the tree of life. As the most recent common ancestor for humans and octopuses lived around750 million years ago, experts believe that many similarities, from similar camera-like eyes to maps of neural activities, evolved separately in a process known asconvergent evolution. While these similarities shed light on evolution's independent paths, they also offer valuable insights for fields like soft robotics and regenerative medicine. Occasionally, unique individuals—like an octopus with an unexpected number of limbs—can provide even deeper clues into how this remarkable nervous system functions and adapts. In 2021, researchers from the Institute of Marine Research in Spain used an underwater camerato followa maleOctopus vulgaris,or common octopus. On its left side, three arms were intact, while the others were reduced to uneven, stumpy lengths, sharply bitten off at varying points. Although the researchers didn’t witness the injury itself, they observed that the front right arm—known as R1—was regenerating unusually, splitting into two separate limbs and giving the octopus a total of nine arms. “In this individual, we believe this condition was a result of abnormal regeneration [a genetic mutation] after an encounter with a predator,” explains Sam Soule, one of the researchers and the first author on the corresponding paper recently published inAnimals. The researchers named the octopus Salvador due to its bifurcated arm coiling up on itself like the two upturned ends ofSalvador Dali’s moustache. For two years, the team studied the cephalopod’s behavior andfoundthat it used its bifurcated arm less when doing “riskier” movements such as exploring or grabbing food, which would force the animal to stretch its arm out and expose it to further injury. “One of the conclusions of our research is that the octopus likely retains a long-term memory of the original injury, as it tends to use the bifurcated arms for less risky tasks compared to the others,” elaborates Jorge Hernández Urcera, a lead author of the study. “This idea of lasting memory brought to mind Dalí’s famous paintingThe Persistence of Memory, which ultimately became the title of the paper we published on monitoring this particular octopus.” While the octopus acted more protective of its extra limb, its nervous systemhad adaptedto using the extra appendage, as the octopus was observed, after some time recovering from its injuries, using its ninth arm for probing its environment. “That nine-armed octopus is a perfect example of just how adaptable these animals are,” Pelled adds. “Most animals would struggle with an unusual body part, but not the octopus. In this case, the octopus had a bifurcated (split) arm and still used it effectively, just like any other arm. That tells us the nervous system didn’t treat it as a mistake—it figured out how to make it work.” Kenna Hughes-Castleberry is the science communicator at JILA (a joint physics research institute between the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the University of Colorado Boulder) and a freelance science journalist.

    "title": "Estate of woman who died in 2021 heat dome sues Big Oil for wrongful death",
    "article_text": "At least 100 heat-related deaths in Washington state came during the unprecedented heat wave. This article originally appeared onInside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy, and the environment. Sign up for their newsletterhere. The daughter of a woman who was killed by extreme heat during the 2021 Pacific Northwest heat dome has filed a first-of-its-kind lawsuit against major oil companies claiming they should be held responsible for her death. Thecivil lawsuit, filed on May 29 in King County Superior Court in Seattle, is thefirst wrongful death casebrought against Big Oil in the US in the context of climate change. It attempts to hold some of the world’s biggest fossil fuel companies liable for the death of Juliana Leon, who perished from overheating during the heat dome event, which scientists have determined would have beenvirtually impossibleabsent human-caused climate change. “The extreme heat that killed Julie was directly linked to fossil fuel-driven alteration of the climate,” the lawsuit asserts. It argues that fossil fuel defendants concealed and misrepresented the climate change risks of their products and worked to delay a transition to cleaner energy alternatives. Furthermore, oil companies knew decades ago that their conduct would have dangerous and deadly consequences, the case alleges. “Defendants have known for all of Julie’s life that their affirmative misrepresentations and omissions would claim lives,” the complaint claims. Leon’s daughter, Misti, filed the suit on behalf of her mother’s estate. At 65, Juliana Leon was driving home from a medical appointment in Seattle on June 28, 2021, a day when the temperature peaked at 108° Fahrenheit (42.2° Celsius). She had the windows rolled down since the air conditioner in her car wasn’t working, but with the oven-like outdoor temperatures she quickly succumbed to the stifling heat. A passerby found her unresponsive in her car, which was pulled over on a residential street. Emergency responders were unable to revive her. The official cause of death was determined to be hyperthermia, or overheating. There were at least100 heat-related deathsin the state from June 26 to July 2, 2021, according to the Washington State Department of Health. Thatunprecedentedstretch of scorching high temperatures was thedeadliest weather-related eventin Washington’s history. Climate change linked to the burning of fossil fuelsintensifiedthis extreme heat event, scientists say. Misti Leon’s complaint argues that big oil companies “are responsible” for her mother’s climate change-related death. “Through their failure to warn, marketing, distribution, extraction, refinement, transport, and sale of fossil fuels, defendants each bear responsibility for the spike in atmospheric CO2levels that have resulted in climate change, and thus the occurrence of a virtually impossible weather event and the extreme temperatures of the Heat Dome,” the suit alleges. Defendants include ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron, Shell, ConocoPhillips, and Phillips 66. Phillips 66 declined to comment; the rest of the companies did not respond to requests for comment. The plaintiff is represented by the Bechtold Law Firm, based in Missoula, Montana. The lawsuit brings state tort law claims of wrongful death, failure to warn, and public nuisance, and seeks relief in the form of damages as well as a public education campaign to “rectify defendants’ decades of misinformation.” Major oil and gas companies are currently facing more than two dozen climate damages and deception cases brought by municipal, state, and tribal governments, including acase filed in 2023 by Multnomah County, Oregon, centeredaround the 2021 Pacific Northwest heat dome. The Leon case, however, is the first climate liability lawsuit filed by an individual against the fossil fuel industry. “This is the first case that is directly making the connection between the misconduct and lies of big oil companies and a specific, personalized tragedy, the death of Julie Leon,” said Aaron Regunberg, accountability director for Public Citizen’s climate program. “It puts a human face on it,” Pat Parenteau, emeritus professor of law at Vermont Law and Graduate School, told Inside Climate News. Climate accountability advocates say the lawsuit could open up a new front for individuals suffering from climate change-related harms to pursue justice against corporate polluters who allegedly lied about the risks of their products. “Big Oil companies have known for decades that their products would cause catastrophic climate disasters that would become more deadly and destructive if they didn’t change their business model. But instead of warning the public and taking steps to save lives, Big Oil lied and deliberately accelerated the problem,” Richard Wiles, president of the Center for Climate Integrity, said in astatement. “This latest case—the first filed on behalf of an individual climate victim—is another step toward accountability.” “It’s a model for victims of climate disasters all across the country,” said Regunberg. “Anywhere there’s an extreme weather event with strong attribution science connecting it to climate change, families experiencing a tragedy can file a very similar case.” Regunberg and several other legal experts have argued that Big Oil could facecriminal prosecutionfor crimes such ashomicideand reckless endangerment in the context of climate change, particularly given evidence of internal industry documents suggesting companies like Exxon knew that unabated fossil fuel use could result in “catastrophic” consequences and deaths. A1996 presentationfrom an Exxon scientist, for example, outlines projected human health impacts stemming from climate change, including “suffering and death due to thermal extremes.” The Leon case could “help lay the groundwork” for potential climate homicide cases, Regunberg said. “Wrongful death suits are important. They provide a private remedy to victims of wrongful conduct that causes a death. But we also think there’s a need for public justice, and that’s the role that criminal prosecution is supposed to have,” he told Inside Climate News. The lawsuit is likely to face a long uphill battle in the courts. Other climate liability cases against these companies brought by government entities have been tied up in procedural skirmishes, some for years, and no case has yet made it to trial. “In this case we have a grieving woman going up against some of the most powerful corporations in the world, and we’ve seen all the legal firepower they are bringing to bear on these cases,” Regunberg said. But if the case does eventually make it to trial, it could be a game-changer. “That’s going to be a jury in King County, Washington, of people who probably experienced and remember the Pacific heat dome event, and maybe they know folks who were impacted. I think that’s going to be a compelling case that has a good chance of getting an outcome that provides some justice to this family,” Regunberg said. Even if it doesn’t get that far, the lawsuit still “marks a significant development in climate liability,” according to Donald Braman, an associate professor of criminal law at Georgetown University and co-author of apaperexplaining the case for prosecuting Big Oil for climate homicide. “As climate attribution science advances, linking specific extreme weather events to anthropogenic climate change with greater confidence, the legal arguments for liability are strengthening. This lawsuit, being the first of its kind for wrongful death in this context, will be closely watched and could set important precedents, regardless of its ultimate outcome,” he said. “It reflects a growing societal demand for accountability for climate-related harms.” Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

Gotta keep the phone charged up when the commercials on the big screen hit. 8BitDo USB Wireless Adapter 2 ($20) It’ll feel wrong at first to use a PS5 controller to play Xbox and vice versa, but it beats buying a completely new gamepad when you can just pair existing ones to your consoles using this USB dongle. The 8BitDo USB Wireless Adapter 2 even works with Switch, so dad can play SuperSmash Bros. Ultimatewith a PS5 or Xbox controller. Apple in China: The Capture of the World's Greatest Company ($30) Whether dad loves Apple or hates it, the company’s sheer scale producing devices like the iPhone and iPad unexpectedly gave birth to China’s technology scene and helped give rise to its largest Asian competitors such as Xiaomi and Huawei.Apple in Chinais a fascinating dive into how Apple’s growth has made the world go round. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 ($50) It’s the talk of the gaming scene for good reason.Clair Obscur: Expedition 33offers a feast for the eyes and ears, and a wonderful story wrapped in gameplay that feels new while scratching the itch of any dad still nostalgic for earlyFinal Fantasytitles. Arcs ($60) Leder Games’ Arcs is the kind of board game that does so much in such a small space. It’s a trick-taking conquest game about gaining space supremacy in the vein of 4X games on PC. If you want to make it extra spicy, also buy the Blighted Reach expansion to connect multiple games into epic, multi-session storylines. Anbernic 34XXSP ($67) Anbernic’s latest Game Boy Advance SP mimic is the kind of device that will put a smile on the face of any dad who grew up with a Game Boy in tow. The34XXSPis powerful enough to play most games from early handhelds, and even a select few games from the N64 or Dreamcast era. SETI: Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence ($70) SETI: Search for Extraterrestrial Life is one of those games that will get both the space-loving and mechanics-minded dads excited to sit at the table with you. It’s a game that will run for several hours, but it ends with such an epic climax that everyone will be jonesing for another round anyway. Xbox Design Lab Controller ($80) That skin oil-worn controller he’s using to play Xbox may work just fine, but that doesnât mean he wouldnât love an upgrade. Microsoftâs Design Lab is full of unique customization optionsâfrom colors to patterns to grips and more. YouTube TV ($82/mo.) If your dad is among the sports-inclined, then you may want to hook him up with a subscription to YouTube TV. Itâs not cheap, but it does come with all the networks he’d need to stream any sport he wants, including ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, and TNT. Backbone One ($100) A quality mobile controller may be the perfect gift if he has ever complained about aching thumbs while trying to play a game on a phone. Our current choice remains theBackbone One, but if you want to spend more, theBackbone Prois a good upgrade with tighter controls. Govee Gaming Pixel Light ($120) Your dad deserves to jazz up his decor beyond bland paintings you can find at a thrift shop. TheGovee Gaming Pixel Lightlets the man in your life add his favorite 8-bit art (32×32 pixels) to his wall. Razer Pro Click V2 Vertical Edition ($120) Logitech’s Lift is the go-to for vertical mice, but if your dad wants one for gaming, Razer’s Pro Click V2 Vertical is the only way to go. Not only does it come with a more ergonomic design, but it also has more programmable buttons, faster polling rates for gaming, and RGBâgotta have RGB for dad to prove he’s a real gamer. Nothing Ear ($130) There are a lot of wireless earbuds out there, but not everyone (dads included) is okay with defaulting to AirPods. Nothingâs Ear, with its ceramic drivers, is fantastic for a dad who needs great audio with a style thatâs just a little bit different than most. Klipsch One Plus Premium ($170) Without making any assumptions about your dad, thereâs a chance that he may appreciate tech thatâs a little more analog. Klipsch’s Bluetooth speaker brings great sound but also a slick mid-century design with knobs to bootâa design that combines modern tech with a vintage look. Lego Mario Kart ($170) What better way to spend time with a dad than over a Lego set? Even better is when that Lego set is a giant Mario riding a go-kart. “It’s-a-me-Mario!” voice not included. Shun Classic Chef Knife ($170) This isn’t the most high-tech product on this list, but it may be among the most practical. We can say with conviction that dad will never struggle with carving a bird ever again if you give the gift of Japanese steel. Polaroid Flip ($200) The Polaroid Flip is all nostalgia wrapped in a retro veneer, and it’s now one of the better ways to take full-size instant photos at home. The camera is a hefty device, so dad may feel like a big, strong man lugging it around. Flipper Zero ($200) The hardware-hacking dad in your life interested in his next DIY project would be absolutely thrilled to have the Flipper Zero. It’s a signal multitool that can connect with various RFID and other radio protocols, plus the GPIO pins and custom firmware can be used to create a whole host of interesting use cases. Boox Palma ($246) Kindles and Kobo e-readers are great for reading ebooks, but they don’t fit into pockets. The Boox Palma is exactly the solutionâa phone-sized e-reader that runs Android apps (though using it for anything more than ebooks is slow AF) that dad can actually grip with one hand. Meater Pro XL ($280) Grill dads who don’t want to stand by the open flame constantly for every cookout will appreciate the Meater Pro XL. The device’s four smart meat probes will let him monitor the temperatures and finish times for multiple meals through a single app, which means no more sprinting back and forth between oven and grill. Meta Quest 3S ($300) Has your dad ever expressed any interest in VR, or even doing some at-home workouts? Set him up with the Quest 3S, and he won’t need anything more. Philips Hue Play Sync Box ($334) If your dad needs an upgrade to his entertainment system, Philips’ Hue Play Sync Box has him covered. This tiny box can coordinate the lighting of a movie with Hue smart lights and syncs TV content at 8K 60Hz and 4K 120Hz for a unique home theater experience. Google Pixel Watch 3 ($350) Everyone has an Apple Watch. Let dad feeldifferentwith the Google Pixel Watch. It tracks almost everything an Apple Watch does, including health and fitness, and the battery life is excellent. The only caveat is that it works with Android phones, not iPhones. Meta Ray-Bans ($350) Smart glasses might seem like an overboard gift if dad isnât tech-inclined, but Metaâs Ray-Bans might be the right ratio of tech-to-style goodness. They have a classic look and are surprisingly nice for Bluetooth audio. Breville Paradice 9 ($395) Don’t fault dad if his knife skills are subpar. Fortunately, a high-powered food processor like the Breville Paradice 9 can slice and dice just about any ingredient more evenly and faster. Technology saves time! Who’d have thunk it? Sony WH-1000XM8 ($448) Whether it’s blocking out a crying baby or angsty teenager, Sony’s latest WH-1000XM6 over-ear headphones deliver best-in-class active noise cancellation. Bonus points: they fold up neatly and come with a case that doesn’t look like a bra (looking at you AirPods Max Smart Case). Xreal One ($500) Maybe some lucky dads will get a $3,500 Apple Vision Pro for Father’s Day, but if all dad needs is a pair of video glasses for watching Netflix and YouTube, Xreal’s One is more than good enough and stupid easy to setup (just plug it into any device that supports USB-C video out). They’re barely larger than a pair of sunglasses, the 1080p video is super sharp, and the screens even dim for a see-through effect. reMarkable Paper Pro ($680) If you’re gonna get dad an e-reader and can splurge for the very best, the reMarkable Paper Pro is the one to get. It’s got a color E Ink screen that’s great for reading comics, supports a stylus for notetaking, and you can even get a keyboard folio case for it. Unagi Model One Voyager ($990) Fixed-gear bikes are so passÃ©. Give the gift of electric mobility with Unagi’s One Voyager scooter, which combines solid speed and range with an easy one-click folding design.

    "article_text": "Prime Video’s upcomingÂMass EffectÂshowis progressing slowly, but surely. On Friday,Deadlinerevealed the live-action series gained Doug Jung as its showrunner. Jung, who most may remember as the co-writer for 2016’sÂStar Trek Beyond,Ârecently ended a showrunner/executive producer stint for Apple TV+’sÂChief of War. He’ll be working alongside writer Dan Casey, and both will EP for the series alongside franchise producer Mike Gamble. As Deadline notes, this is a “major step forward” in the show’s development, which was first teased all the way back in 2021, then had its existencereaffirmedback in 2024. To date, Prime Video’s kept mum on what exactly Casey’s pitch was for theÂMass EffectÂshow. Among fans, the general thinking is that it’ll just adapt the initial trilogy ofCommander Shepardgathering allies to fight the Reapers. (This also seemed to be the plan when a movie seemed likely back in 2007 after the first game came out.) But shows likeÂCastlevaniaÂand Prime Video’s ownÂFalloutÂhave taken a different approach that tells an original story inside the worlds of those series. (FalloutÂin particular carries itself like aÂFallout 5Âwe’re getting to watch but not play.) Others, likeÂTomb RaiderandDragon Age,continued (or hoped to) the stories of the games they’re based on. There’s certainly different routes for theÂMass Effectseries to take, and we’ll be interested to learn Jung and Casey’s approach in due time. Want more io9 news?

    "article_text": "TheFantastic Four: First Stepsdoesn’t justlook unlikeany other mainstream superhero movie in recent years, it’s also got an unusual sound to match. Followingticketsgoing on sale for the movie, Marvel released the full track for the film’s main theme, created by longtime film composerMichael Giacchino. There’ve been snippets of the theme present in trailers and the IMAX pre-roll forThunderbolts*, so we already knew it would sound as 1960s as the world the heroes live in. But hearing the full thing really underlines the importance of a composer that vibes with the material and wants to make a score that’s exciting and memorable music. For the most part, this is something Marvel’s not really done well at, save for works composed by Alan Silvestri or Ludwig GÃ¶ransson or Son Lux’s more recent work onÂThunderbolts*. But having memorable music is what Giacchino’s always been good atâhis scores for the most recentStar TrekÂmovies are still sublime, and hisFantastic Four: First Stepswork sounds like some of his best for Marvel specifically. (Starting with the firstDoctor Strange,Âhe’s composed for the MCU Spider-Man trilogy,ÂThor: Love & Thunder,andÂWerewolf by Night, the latter of which he also directed.) Like everything else from this movie, the score is sounding promising, and we can’t wait to hear all of it, ditto seeing the punny titles Giacchino has undoubtedly come up with for each track.

    "title": "OpenAI Wants to get College Kids Hooked on AI",
    "article_text": "AI chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT have been shown repeatedly toprovide false information,hallucinatecompletely made-up sources and facts, and lead people astray with theirconfidently wrong answersto questions. For that reason, AI tools areviewed with skepticismby many educators. So, of course, OpenAI and its competitors are targeting colleges and pushing its services on studentsâconcerns be damned. According to the New York Times, OpenAI is in the midst of a major push to make ChatGPT a fixture on college campuses, replacing many aspects of the college experience with AI alternatives. According to the report, the company wants college students to have a “personalized AI account” as soon as they step on campus, same as how they receive a school email address. It envisions ChatGPT serving as everything from a personal tutor to a teacher’s aide to a career assistant that helps students find work after graduation. Some schools are already buying in, despite the educational world initially greeting AI with distrust and outright bans. Per the Times, schools like the University of Maryland, Duke University, and California State University have all signed up for OpenAI’s premium service, ChatGPT Edu, and have started to integrate the chatbot into different parts of the educational experience. It’s not alone in setting its sights on higher education, either. Elon Musk’s xAI offeredfree accessto its chatbot Grok to students during exam season, and Google is currently offering its Gemini AI suite to students forfreethrough the end of the 2025-26 academic year. But that is outside of the actual infrastructure of higher education, which is where OpenAI is attempting to operate. Universities opting to embrace AI, after initially taking hardline positions against it overfears of cheating, is unfortunate. There is already a fair amount of evidence piling up that AI is not all that beneficial if your goal is to learn and retain accurate information. Astudy published earlier this yearfound that reliance on AI can erode critical thinking skills. Others have similarly found that people will“offload” the more difficult cognitive workand rely on AI as a shortcut. If the idea of university is to help students learn how to think, AI undermines it. And that’s before you get into the misinformation of it all. In an attempt to see how AI could serve in a focused education setting,researchers tried training different modelson a patent law casebook to see how they performed when asked questions about the material. They all produced false information, hallucinated cases that did not exist, and made errors. The researchers reported that OpenAI’s GPT model offered answers that were “unacceptable” and “harmful for learning” about a quarter of the time. That’s not ideal. Considering that OpenAI and other companies want to get their chatbots ingrained not just in the classroom, but in every aspect of student life, there are other harms to consider, too. Reliance on AI chatbots can have anegative impact on social skills. And the simple fact that universities are investing in AI means they aren’t investing in areas that would create more human interactions. A student going to see a tutor, for example, creates a social interaction that requires using emotional intelligence and establishing trust and connection, ultimately adding to asense of community and belonging. A chatbot just spits out an answer, which may or may not be correct. ChatbotsChatGPTOpenAIUniversity Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Although OpenAI has continually slammed the New York Times' copyright lawsuit, the case isn't as meritless as the company claims. The AI industry's business model is once again being put under a legal microscope. Pen and paper is back, baby. We don't know anything for sure, but we know what it's likely not.

    "title": "Summer Game Fest Doesn’t Just Try Its Best, It Tries Too Hard",
    "article_text": "After a PlayStation showcase earlier in the week, the annual video game promo circuit for the summer began in earnest with that two-hour showcase by the name ofSummer Game Fest, which hadteases, sequels, and wholly new games galore. Par for the course for SGF and host Geoff Keighley, both of which have endeavored to step up during this decade as the once and glorious trade show king E3 has gradually died off. But this year’s carried an odd air about it, even before aSplitgate 2Âdeveloper walked onstage with a “Make FPS Great Again Hat” (really) before smacktalking “the sameCall of Duty” and revealing his shooter’s battle royale mode. A lot of that weirdness is because the games industry is going through it right now. It’s been over a week since EA killed itsBlack Panther gameand developer Cliffhanger, and industry layoffs have only continued since. Time stops for no one, and since 2023, there’ve been reductions by the dozens or hundreds, sometimes on a daily, even hourly basis. What we thought was just “survive til ’25” in 2023 or 2024 is now just “survive” asgames and their studiosdie in the blink of an eye. Combined with what feels like a weirdly mutedNintendo Switch 2launch and the United States government going throughanother round of bullshit, of course this trade show feels funky. Other factors to this strange feeling are owed entirely to Summer Game Fest. Never is it more clear when the industry is chasing trends than an event like this, which had plenty of souls and roguelikes and shooters of the space, competitive, and extraction variety. The two genres’ popularity seemed to wear on viewers and remind us how we easily tire of things we once liked. Compared to PlayStation’s showcase earlier in the week, SGF also felt less consistent in what it had to offer:Resident Evil RequiemÂandÂWu-Tang: Rise of the DeceiverÂwere agreeable highs, other trailers seemed to show up to be polite or didn’t really land. More problematically, five years in, Summer Game Fest still feels like it has no real identity of its own beyond an extension of the annual year’s end Game Awards. Those ceremonies and accompanying game reveals have a substantially different energy thanks to musical performances, celebrity appearances and usually delightful Muppet gags. Without those, SGF feels less “fun,” for lack of a better word. It wants to be E3, but the big pressers we tuned in for could sometimes be bad as figureheads for game publishers were high off their own supply or overindulged in nonsensetheyÂseemed to think was funny. This can’t be that, both because publishers have their indvidual, more regular showcases, and it doesn’t want to be perceived as disrespectful to the medium and its audience happy to receive recognition but not the criticism that comes with it. Previously, Keighley has caught flack for failing to properly acknowledge the industry’s struggles, or doing so in a clumsy manner. This year’s Summer Game Fest opened with him highlighting 2025’s current crop of best-selling games, some of which came from teams much smaller than your average triple-A studio.Expedition 33’sÂbeen the biggest and worst offender of this “honor”; since the RPG’s reveal and launch, it’s been lauded as a triumph for a developer with a headcount in the small dozens. But itsseven-minute creditsshow that’s not the true story: yes, Sandfall has33 or 34 employees, but it also had third-party animators, QA contractors, and localizers (and more!) that helped make for a fantastic debut title. Keighley’s stressing of those small teamsâone guy made a brawler with just the help ofnine of his friends!âturns what was likely a well-intentioned acknowledgment of into additional fuel for the fiery divide between indie and triple-A developers at a bad time for both. The narrative around game development (and who makes them) is bad enough thanks to ongoing layoffs and increased player harassment, and this will likely exacerbate things. It’s a moment that best represents the double-edged sword of Summer Game Fest’s prominence and this particular industry figurehead: sooner or later, amid all the flash and celebration this window into the industry provides, someone sours things by putting their foot in their mouth.

    "title": "Musk Deletes His ‘Really Big Bomb’ Claiming Trump Appears in Epstein Files",
    "article_text": "In the middle of their very public breakup, a scorned Elon Musk decided to drop a “really big bomb” on Donald Trump, accusing the president of appearing in the Epstein files. Sometime Saturday, it seems the billionaire decided he wanted to try to disarm that bomb, as hedeletedhis posts claiming that Trump has links to the famous child sex trafficker. Musk and Trump had been acting catty for a couple of days by the time Musk went nuclear, going back and forth over Musk’s opposition to Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill”âa proposal that includes the largest cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programsin history. Musk objected to the bill, not because it would be devastating to low- and middle-income households but seemingly ratherbecauseit was going to hurt his own bottom line by ending electric vehicle tax credits thatTesla benefits from. Musk tried to kill the bill by posting incessantly about it, creating a rift among Republicans who will essentially need everyone in the party to be on board in order to get the thing passed. Trump, annoyed, took some shots at Musk for his dissent, which led to Musk’s drastic escalation. He said Trump appeared in the Epstein files and “That is the real reason they have not been made public.” He added: “Mark this post for the future. The truth will come out.” Those posts are now deletedâthough have, of course, been archived, screenshotted, and quoted many times over. So, too, has a post in which Musk supported the idea that Trump should be impeached. He hasn’t gotten around to taking down hispostclaiming that Trump’s tariffs will soon cause a recession. We’re starting to get a better picture of what has been happening behind the scenes while these two lash out at each other via their respective social media platforms (X and Truth Social). Areport published Saturday by the Washington Postclaims that Trump was “dejected” during Musk’s crash out and tried to rationalize Musk’s behavior by calling him âa big-time drug addict.â Musk had apparently been acting erratically for quite some time (not exactly a shock, if you’ve scrolled through his posts on X for like, 30 seconds). A reported physical conflict with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that saw Musk supposedly throw his shoulder into Bessent was the breaking point, after which the billionaire started to get pushed out of his privileged position in the administration, per the Post. Trump opted not to pour gasoline on the situationâa shocking decision from a guy not exactly known for his restraintâbut he is apparently not interested in reconciling with Musk.

    "article_text": "It’s been years since Paramount+’s TV reboot ofThe Twilight ZoneÂquietly ended, but theanthology seriesmay be coming back to the big screen. Per Jeff Sneider, Warner Bros., which holds film rights for the franchise, is looking atÂSeveranceÂexecutive producer and lead director Ben Stiller to direct a new film. Various creatives have tried at it over the years, includingMatt ReevesandJoseph Kosinski. But according to Sneider, Stiller may be the guy WB and production company Appian Way have needed to finally get the ball rolling on this film. The actor-director is a fan of the anthology show and previously cited it as an influence onSeverance,Âup to and including a season two episode named afterÂTwilight’s1960 episode “The After Hours.” The 1983ÂTwilight ZoneÂmovie had four segments, but this new film will reportedly just have one. Sneider claims one source told him the story would be supernatural and center on a fighter pilot assigned to a rocket that achieves time travel, which delivers him to a utopia 125 years in the future. The reporter stressed this could easily change: while Stiller’s allegedly been on board for “roughly six months,” it remains an open writing assignment (OWA), meaning any screenwriter could come on board and run with that premise or propose their own new take. Sneider also acknowledged that if StillerÂisÂdirecting this movie, it’ll be a ways out. Along with the third season ofÂSeverance,Âhe’s starring in a fourthÂFockersÂmovie due holiday 2026 and directing the 1970s crime dramaÂBag Man.ÂStill, we’ll report more on this potentialTwilight ZoneÂmovie as news about it comes out.

    "article_text": "Every few years, a Silicon Valley gig-economy company announces a âdisruptiveâ innovation that looks a whole lot like a bus. Uber rolled out Smart Routes a decade ago, followed a short time later by the Lyft Shuttle of its biggest competitor. Even Elon Musk gave it a try in 2018 with the âurban loop systemâ that never quite materializedbeyond the Vegas Strip. And does anyone remember Chariot? Now itâs Uberâs turn again. The ride-hailing company recently announcedRoute Share, in which shuttles will travel dozens of fixed routes, with fixed stops, picking up passengers and dropping them off at fixed times. Amid the inevitable jokes about Silicon Valley once again discovering buses are serious questions about what this will mean for struggling transit systems, air quality, and congestion. Uber promised the program, which rolled out in seven cities at the end of May, will bring âmore affordable, more predictableâ transportation during peak commuting hours. âMany of our users, they live in generally the same area, they work in generally the same area, and they commute at the same time,â Sachin Kansal, the companyâs chief product officer, said during the companyâs May 14 announcement. âThe concept of Route Share is not new,â he admitted â though he never used the word âbus.â Instead, pictures of horse-drawn buggies, rickshaws, and pedicabs appeared onscreen. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was a bit more forthcoming whenhe told The Vergethe whole thing is âto some extent inspired by the bus.â The goal, he said, âis just to reduce prices to the consumer and then help with congestion and the environment.â But Kevin Shen, who studies this sort of thing at the Union of Concerned Scientists, questions whether Uberâs ânext-gen busâ will do much for commuters or the climate. âEverybody will say, âSilicon Valleyâs reinventing the bus again,ââ Shen said. âBut itâs more like theyâre reinventing a worse bus.â Five years ago, the Union of Concerned Scientists released areportthat found ride-share services emit 69 percent more planet-warming carbon dioxide and other pollutants than the trips they displace â largely because as many as 40 percent of the miles traveled by Uber and Lyft drivers are driven without a passenger, something called âdeadheading.â That climate disadvantage decreases with pooled services like UberX Share â but itâs still not much greener than owning and driving a vehicle, the report noted, unlessthe car is electric. Beyond the iffy climate benefit lie broader concerns about what this means for the transit systems in New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Philadelphia, Dallas, Boston, and Baltimore â and the people who rely on them. âTransit is a public service, so a transit agencyâs goal is to serve all of its customers, whether theyâre rich or poor, whether itâs the maximum profit-inducing route or not,â Shen said. The entities that do all of this come with accountability mechanisms â boards, public meetings, vocal riders â to ensure they do what theyâre supposed to. âBarely any of that is in place for Uber.â This, he said, is a pivot toward a public-transit modelwithout public accountability. Compounding the threat, Philadelphia and Dallas have struggling transit systems at risk of defunding. The situation is so dire in Philly that it may cut service by nearly 45 percent on July 1 amid a chronic financial crisis. (That, as one Reddit user pointed out,would be good news for Uber.) Meanwhile, the federal government is cutting support for public services,including transit systemsâ many of which still havenât fully recovered from COVID-era budget crunches. Though ridership nationwide is up to85 percent of pre-pandemic levels, Bloomberg News recently estimated that transit systems across the country face a$6 billion budget shortfall. So itâs easy to see why companies like Uber see a business opportunity in public transit. Khosrowshahi insists Uber is âin competition with personal car ownership,â not public transportation. âPublic transport is a teammate,â he told The Verge. But astudyreleased last year by the University of California, Davis found that in three California cities, over half of all ride-hailing trips didnât replace personal cars, they replaced moresustainable modes of getting around, like walking, public transportation, and bicycling. And then thereâs the fact cities like New York grapple withchronic congestionand donât need more vehicles cluttering crowded streets. During Uberâs big announcement, Kansal showed a video of one possible Route Share ride in the Big Apple. It covered about 3 miles from Midtown to Lower Manhattan, which would take about 30 minutes and cost $13. But hereâs the thing: The addresses are served by three different subway lines. It is possible to commute between those two points, avoid congestion, and arrive sooner, for $2.90. So, yes, Uber Route Share is cheaper than Uberâs standard car service(which has gotten 7.2 percent pricier in the past year)â but Route Share is far from the most efficient or economical way to get around in the biggest markets itâs launching in. âIf anything,â Shen said, âitâs reducing transit efficiency by gumming up those same routes with even more vehicles.â This article originally appeared inGristathttps://grist.org/transportation/uber-shared-route-buses/.Â Grist is a nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future.

    "title": "The Best Sci-Fi, Fantasy, and Horror Trailers at Summer Game Fest 2025",
    "article_text": "Every year,Summer Game Festis home to plenty of trailers for all sorts ofgames, be they major titles or small ones, right around the corner and who knows how far off. We’ve got a list of the biggest ones in the 2025 showcase, plus those that caught our eye for one reason or another. Let us know your faves in the comments below. Bandai Namco had a few flashy action games at Summer Game Fest, and the biggest wasÂCode Vein II. The sequel to 2019’s action-RPG will tell a story across two eras and star the player-made Hunter tasked with disposing of Revenants (undead humans with vampiric powers) that’ve morphed into monsters called Horrors. With the help of a girl named Lou, the Hunter travels across time to change the fates of key Revenants who could help alter the future for the better. Code Vein IIÂreleases in 2026 for PC, XSX|S, and PS5. From new developer Section 9 Interactive,End of AbyssÂis set in a dark sci-fi world where technician Cel investigates a series of disturbances in an underground compound. Said disturbances include ominous audio logs, something strange on the walls, and monsters around the area, some of which can multiply. Look forEnd of AbyssÂto hit in 2026 for PS5, XSX|S, and PC on the Epic Games Store. RememberAtomic Heartfrom a few years ago? Itâs getting two continuations from developer Mundfish. The first,Atomic Heart II, is billed as a âspiritual successorâ to the first game, and will feature more RPG elements for players to dig into while exploring the series’ retrofuturist alt-history universe.Â Then thereâsThe Cube, an open-world MMO wherein players explore an ever-changing structure and face enemies to get more gear, get higher numbers, and do it all again. Neither it norAtomic Heart IIhave set dates, but when they do, they’ll presumably release for PC, PS5, and XSX|S. Summer Game Fest featured a trailer forCosmic Invasionshowing two new heroes coming to the 2D beat-em-up: She-Hulk and Rocket Raccoon. (Noticeably sans Groot, unlike the duo’s recent appearances inMarvel RivalsandGuardians of the Galaxy.) Jenâs got her strength, Rocketâs got his claws and guns, theyâre both helping the previously revealed heroes like Quasar, Storm, and Spider-Man repel the Annihilation Wave moving through the galaxy. Marvel Cosmic Invasionreleases on PS4 and 5, XSX|S, and PC later this year. Capcom’s looking to bring back some franchises it’s left behind in recent years, starting withÂOnimusha. We already knew the next entry,Way of the Sword,sees protagonist Musashi use his katana to slice up demonic Genma in Edo-era Japan. But the new trailer introduces his rival Sasaki Ganryu and reveals the Oni Gauntlet around Musashi’s wrist lets him summon a young woman to talk to. What else can the Gauntlet do, and why do he and Ganryu have them? We’ll find out whenOnimusha: Way of the Swordcomes in 2026 for PC and consoles. Even if you don’t listen to hip-hop, you surely know Wu-Tang Clan orits membersby reputation. Developer Brass Lion Entertainment’sÂRise of the DeceiverÂasks players a very important question: how would you like to save Ghostface Killah’s Wu brothers, then fight alongside them and use their powers against the titular Deceiver? If that sounds fun to you, the co-op action-RPGâfeaturing writing from io9 alum Evan Narcisseâis hitting PC sometime in 2026. For the Metroidvania fans,ÂMio: Memories in OrbitÂmade an appearance at the event. In it, players explore the massive technological ark known as the Vessel, which is home to rogue machines. It falls to Mio to save the Vessel’s residents while hacking the machines to bits and gaining new abilites to explore the space station when the game comes out later this year for PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and X|S, and PS4 and 5. There’s a free demo on Steam, which you can playhere. Described as a cross betweenÂDoki Doki Literature ClubÂandÂSilent Hill,ÂSerenity Forge’sÂFractured BloomsÂstars Angie, a girl stuck in a time loop. While figuring out how to break it, she cooks, grows food, and helps the locals, all of which may be key to figuring out how to get to the next day. But with each new loop comes some kind of shift in the day, like someone remembering Angie’s past actions, or the cycle pushing back against her. Should any of that intrigue you,Fractured BloomsÂwill release on PC in the near future. Yacht Club Games’ debut title was 2014’sShovel Knight,Âand it was so big the studio expanded on it with several post-launch campaigns and spinoff titles. The studio’s next project,Mina the Hollower,Âis a top-down action-adventure starring a genius mouse inventor studying the Earth. With her whip and “hollowing” ability that lets her move quickly underground, Mina explores Tenebrous Isle and looks to free it from its curse. Mina the HollowerÂreleases October 31 for PC, Xbox One and X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PS4 and 5. There’s a free demo out now for Steam players on PC, which you can downloadhere. Itâs been over a decade since Deadpool headlined a solo game, now here he is back in the spotlight for a VR title. Meta Quest 3 and 3S owners will inhabit the Merc With a Mouth as he kills enemies, cracks wise, and swears in the voice of Neil Patrick Harris while visiting different locations across the Marvel Universe. VR and the first-person perspective also offers creative, Wade-like ways to kill enemies, from simply shooting or stabbing them to shoving their face into a propeller or feeding them to a monster. Deadpool VRÂlaunches in late 2025. Scott Pilgrimâs story never truly ends. Developer Tribute unveiledScott Pilgrim EXat Summer Game Fest, which sees Scott and Ramona Flowers team up with five other playable characters to fight the Vegans, Robots, and Goths that’ve taken over Toronto.EXlooks to be a sequel to Netflix’sScott Pilgrim Takes Off,and has that show’s co-creators Bryan Lee O’Malley (who created the original comic) and BenDavid Grabinski involved. Also along for the ride are animator Paul Robertson and musician Anamanaguchi, who both contributed to Ubisoft’s cult classic tie-in game (also a beat-em-up!) from 2010.Â Scott Pilgrim EXcomes to PC and consoles in 2026.Â From Team Clout and Mundfish Powerhouse, the first-person horror gameIllhas plenty of zombies (both clothed and naked), gore, and body horror to make clear it’s gonna be a freaky time. If that weren’t enough, a swarm of zombie babies rushing the player might underline things. Fortunately, you can kick those little terrors away.Unfortunately, there’s plenty of other hostile stuff that wants to kill you in the research fort you’re exploring when the game comes out for PC, PS5, and XSX|S in the near future. First-time developer Cubit Studios revealedÂInfinitesimals,Âand like the name implies, stars small characters waging a big war against one another. Captain Awkney’s hoping to find a new home for his people, and to do that, he’ll have to fight enemy soldiers his own size and bigger animals like ants, birds, and spiders. It looks likeHaloÂmixed withÂA Bug’s Life,Âand it’s coming to Epic Games Store, PS5, and XSX|S in 2026. Closing out Summer Game Fest wasÂResident Evil Requiem,Âthe ninth mainline game in the survival horror series. FBI agent Grace Ashcroftâdaughter ofResident Evil Outbreak’sÂAlyssaâis tasked with looking into an incident at a hotel that also happens to be where her mother was killed. Things aren’t right at the hotel, and Grace is gonna be through hell. And that’s just the start, as part of her journey might involve a trip back to the bombed Racoon City. We’ll see what terrors there await whenÂResident Evil RequiemÂcomes out on February 27, 2026 for PC, XSX|S, and PS5. Want more io9 news?

Miller's affection for the X-Men goes beyond 'Deadpool,' and he'd love to take a crack at Kitty Pryde in particular. The Merc with the Mouth and World's Greatest Detective will appear in a brand new series of comics. Ryan Reynolds is reportedly exploring another Marvel team up for the Merc with the Mouth.

    "title": "Million-Dollar Project Aims to Expose Bad Medical Research",
    "article_text": "A new initiative from the watchdogs behind Retraction Watch is taking aim at flawed or faked medical science research to the tune of nearly $1 million. TheCenter for Scientific Integrityjust launched the Medical Evidence Project, a two-year effort to identify published medical research with a negative effect on health guidelinesâand to make sure people actually hear about it. Equipped with a $900,000 grant from Open Philanthropy and a core team of up to five investigators, the project will use forensic metascience tools to identify issues in scientific articles, and report its findings via Retraction Watch, the foremost site for scientific watchdogging. âWe originally set up the Center for Scientific Integrity as a home for Retraction Watch, but we always hoped we would be able to do more in the research accountability space,â said Ivan Oransky, executive director of the Center and co-founder of Retraction Watch, in apostannouncing the grant. âThe Medical Evidence Project allows us to support critical analysis and disseminate the findings.â According toNature, these flawed and falsified documents are vexing because they skew meta-analysesâreviews that combine the findings from multiple studies to draw more statistically robust conclusions. If one or two bunk studies make it into a meta-analysis, they can tip the scales on health policy. In 2009, to name one case, a European guideline recommended the use of beta-blockers during non-cardiac surgery, based on turn-of-the-millennium research that was later called into question. Years later, an independent review suggested that the guidance may have contributed to 10,000 deaths per year in the UK. Led by James Heathers, a science integrity consultant, the team’s plan is to build software tools, chase down leads from anonymous whistleblowers, and pay peer reviewers to check their work. Theyâre aiming to identify at least 10 flawed meta-analyses a year. The team is picking its moment wisely. As Gizmodo previously reported,AI-generated junk scienceis flooding the academic digital ecosystem, showing up in everything from conference proceedings to peer-reviewed journals. A study published in Harvard Kennedy Schoolâs Misinformation Review found that two-thirds of sampled papers retrieved through Google Scholar contained signs of GPT-generated textâsome even in mainstream scientific outlets. About 14.5% of those bogus studies focused on health. Thatâs particularly alarming because Google Scholar doesnât distinguish between peer-reviewed studies and preprints, student papers, or other less-rigorous work. And once this kind of bycatch gets pulled into meta-analyses or cited by clinicians, itâs hard to untangle the consequences. âIf we cannot trust that the research we read is genuine,â one researcher told Gizmodo, âwe risk making decisions based on incorrect information.â We’ve already seen how nonsense can slip through. In 2021, Springer Natureretracted over 40papers from its Arabian Journal of Geosciencesâstudies so incoherent they read like AI-generated Mad Libs. Just last year, the publisher Frontiers had to pull a paper featuring anatomically impossible AI-generated images ofrat genitals. Weâve entered the era of digital fossils, in which AI models trained on web-scraped data are beginning topreserve and propagatenonsense phrases as if they were real scientific terms. For example, earlier this year a group of researchers found a garbled set of words from a 1959 biology paper embedded in the outputs of large language models including OpenAI’s GPT-4o. In that climate, the Medical Evidence Projectâs goal feels more like triage than cleanup. The team is dealing with a deluge of flawed information, hiding in plain sight, and plenty of which can have very real health consequences if taken at face value.

The Bank of England warned that AI bots could converge on similar trading strategies, exacerbating downturns or bubbles. A recent investigation of the academic search engine highlights the pervasive issue of AI-generated text in academic literature, especially regarding controversial topics. As ChatGPT continues to grow in capabilities and usageâincluding in education and academiaâis it high time for universities to revert to a time-tested form? OpenAI's text generator repeatedly wrote academic abstracts convincing enough to get past human readers. It could mean trouble for scientific publishing.

    "title": "The 2025 MacBook Air Hits Its Lowest Price Ever, Amazon Is Pulling Out All the Stops on Apple",
    "article_text": "This article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. Apple doesn’t typically offer huge discounts on its latest products, and fans have a challenge getting real deals. While Black Friday and Prime Day are being hyped as the best times to buy, biggest discounts can come out of nowhere – especially on online retailers like Amazon. Now, the brand new 2025 MacBook Air 13-inch with the M4 chip and 256GB storage is available atan all-time low price of just $849, which is a 15% discount from the list price of $999. This is a one-time opportunity, considering that the laptop was launched only in March and is already flying off the shelves in most regions. See at Amazon The 2025 MacBook Air is powered by the newest Apple M4 chip, which features a 10-core CPU (with 4 performance cores and 6 efficiency cores) and a high-speed GPU, for effortless multitasking, fast app launching and smooth graphics for everything. The 16GB of unified memory ensures even demanding tasks remain responsive, and the 256GB SSD provides fast storage for your most important files and projects. Apple’s latest laptop is also made for Apple Intelligence, which is a personal intelligence service that helps the user write, communicate, and get things done very easily. Featuring advanced privacy protection, Apple Intelligence keeps your information secure and does not even let Apple access it. This level of privacy is a big advantage if you like to maintain confidentiality and have peace of mind. Another selling point is the battery life – with up to 18 hours on one charge. What’s more, the 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display is a visual treat with 1 billion colors, deep contrast, precise detail, and sharp text. The MacBook Air also sets the pace in connectivity and convenience: It features two Thunderbolt 4 ports for quick data transfer and external display support, a MagSafe charging port for quick and safe charging, a headphone jack, Wi-Fi 6E for ultra-speedy wireless connectivity, and Bluetooth 5.3. The laptop supports up to two external displays (it doesn’t have to be Apple own monitors) which makes it a great choice for home and office productivity environments.

    "title": "Trump’s DOT Threatens to Pull Funding for California’s High-Speed Rail",
    "article_text": "Californiaâs long-promised high-speed train project, first approved in 2008, has hit lots of roadblocks in its development process, and now it may be looking at the end of the road. The Trump administration’s Department of Transportation released a report this week that does not paint a pretty picture of the project, and DOT head Sean Duffy has given California just over a month to respond to concerns or face having $4 billion in government funding rescinded,according to Reuters. The threat to cut off California follows a 315-page report published by the Federal Railroad Administration that claims California has missed several deadlines related to the high-speed rail and has failed to identify how it will secure $7 billion in funding to build a segment of rail between Merced and Bakersfield, California, which itneeds to secure by next summerin order for the project to move forward. The report concludes, in quite Trumpian language, that California “conned the taxpayer out of its $4 billion investment, with no viable plan to deliver even that partial segment on time.” The Department of Transportation gave California until mid-July to respond to the report, threatening to terminate federal contracts if it fails to sufficiently address concerns raised in the report. The California High-Speed Rail Authority called the report “misguided,”according to a report from the Los Angeles Times, and said it will issue a formal response soon. âWe remain firmly committed to completing the nationâs first true high-speed rail system connecting the major population centers in the state,â a spokesperson for the agency said. Trump has been on California’s ass about the rail project basically since he returned to office. His administrationlaunched a yet-to-be-completed reviewof a $3.1 billion federal grant to help fund construction back in February, and last month he singled out the project during a joint appearance with Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada, stating,Â âThat train is the worst cost overrun Iâve ever seen,â and âThis government is not going to pay.â The scrutiny from Trump and company isn’t exactly a surprise to officials involved in the high-speed rail’s buildout, asofficials signaled earlier this yearthat there may be funding shortfalls from the federal government on the horizon. And while plenty of people are frustrated by how long the California rail project has taken to come together and how much it costs, the federal government really is not on the hook for that much of it.Per the LA Times, California has paid for 82% of the project, relying on federal grants for just 18% of funding. While California’s high-speed rail has had plenty of issuesâmostly inflicted by politicsâthe “train to nowhere” label that it often gets hit with no longer matches the picture on the ground. More than 119 miles of rail have been laid between Merced and Bakersfield, and the project isclose enough to completionthat abandoning it at this point would be more wasteful than finishing it, especially with communities along the routeexpecting a potential economic boomonce it is up and running. But good luck telling that to Trump (and Elon Musk who has opposed it from the beginning).

    "title": "Sam Altman’s Brief Ouster at OpenAI Is Getting the Movie Treatment",
    "article_text": "At some point, Hollywood decided the world of tech was a nice little well for drama, but it can probably just throw out the latest material that it’s happened into rather than serving it to the rest of us. According toThe Hollywood Reporter, we’re going to be getting a movie based on the five-day period that Sam Altman was ousted and ultimately reinstated as the head of OpenAI. The film, which will reportedly be titled “Artificial,” already has a pretty star-studded call sheet, though everything is still in the rumor period, it seems. Luca Guadagnino, director ofCall Me by Your NameandChallengers,is reportedly in talks to direct the picture. Andrew Garfield is currently the favorite to play Altman, which is very much in his wheelhouse after his performance as Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin inThe Social Network. Monica Barbaro, who played Joan Baez inA Complete Unknown, is reportedly in talks to play former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati, andAnorabreakout star Yura Borisov is up for company co-founder and Altman antagonist Ilya Sutskever. Comedy writer Simon Rich, who wrote for “Saturday Night Live” and created “Miracle Workers,” is reportedly responsible for the screenplay. One of the problems for Hollywood repeatedly going after these real-life Big Tech dramas is that the industries are now so entangled. This OpenAI flick, for instance, is handled by Amazon MGM Studios. Amazon is about$8 billion deep into investmentsinto OpenAI rival Anthropic. So like, do they have the motivation to trash OpenAI in this thing? (Not that external pressure to do so is necessary, but still.) And sure, the drama at OpenAI is compelling. It’s not too often that the founder of one of the hottest companies around gets kicked out by the board because they no longer trust him, only for him to be reinstated five days later. And, as stories like theWall Street Journal’s accounting of the eventshighlight, there is no shortage of intrigue and backstabbing along the way that will probably play well on the big screen. But ugh is the list of these Silicon Valley dramas getting long, and it doesn’t feel like it’s really accomplishing much other than pumping the egos of the subjects.The Social Networkremains probably the best work the genre has produced (save for HBO’s “Silicon Valley,” which hasn’t aged a day since it came to an end), and even that failed to really capture just how greedy and unethical these people would turn out. (Though, give Aaron Sorkin this, he probably was ahead of the curve on calling out the bro-ish-ness of Zuckerberg that is now on display when he pops up on Joe Rogan’s podcast.) The rest of the offerings have their charms, to be sure. “The Dropout,” “WeCrashed,” and “Super Pumped” all manage to pull out some great performances and are built around compelling stories. But none of them really sufficiently get at the greed, corruption, and frankly, the disdain for everyone from regulators to actual, regular people who get harmed while these people amass their fortunes. Maybe that’s because the stories typically follow the central figuresâthe Altmans and Zuckerbergs and Holmeses of the worldâfrom their seats in the C-suites, and they are so rarely confronted with reality there.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. WTF: Waifu Tactical Force, a real game that was shown at the Future Games Show today, is a movement shooter where each win lets you earn the things you need to unlock new characters (as in, waifus) and upgrade your \"waifu-run Mother Base\" for new perks to use on missions and in 3v3 shooter matches. \"Each system feeds the next: shoot to build, build to upgrade, upgrade to dominate. Wrapped in a visual novel framework, it’s a genre hybrid where management, skill, and waifus drive everything,\" says the developer, which is called Team Waifu, in case you haven't figured out who this game is for yet. WTF is set to release in 2026, and has started an alpha playtest now. It's aiming for \"AAA net code with regional dedicated servers and optimization for 60 fps on low-spec devices,\" which for a lot of people might be a better selling point than the cute anime ladies and focus on Y2K aesthetics. While clearly inspired by the popularity of character-collecting free-to-play games likeGenshin Impactand Wuthering Waves, the studio has established its own look and is working in a genre less touched by cute anime girl driven videogaming. It's clear they're passionate about the material, since their other game is literally just calledWaifu. The 3v3, five round FPS elimination matches with a fast time-to-kill are especially interesting, given that they're paired with a loadout perk tweak between rounds and you unlock those perks via a Fallout Shelter-style base management game.

When Scum launched into early access it made quite a stir: the hardcore multiplayer survival game had some pretty deep systems that simulated calories and carbs, body fat and muscle mass, and even kept track of each of your teeth. Scum was probably more notorious for the fact thatyou could poop. Gross, yes, but also funny. Throw in cannibalism and masks made from human skin, and Scum quickly became Devolver Digital's biggest launch to date. That date was 2018, but times flies (it's not even a Devolver game anymore) and Scum is now poised, at last, to leave early access on July 17. Check out the release date trailer above. In seven years of early access, Scum has added a lot: skill systems, stealth mechanics, expanded base building, and vehicles, as well as quirky features like heart attacks for players who gained too much weight. Oh yeah, it also added naked butts and penis sliders—and players who bought the \"supporters pack\" got a couple extra inches (on their dongs, not their butts) as a thank you. The 1.0 release will feature a \"full map rework,\" new vehicles, and \"a major graphical overhaul that improves the game’s visual quality and performance,\" says Gamepires.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Firefighting is cool, and dangerous, and there's lots of neat gear, plus you get to saw holes in houses, so it's obvious that there should be a Farming Simulator-esque game about everyday heroes doing their thing. That's the pitch behind Firefighting Simulator: Ignite, a four player co-op sim where you'll run a fire department in the American Midwest in charge of stopping all manner of fires. It's primed to release this fall. With a set of real vehicles tools to use, including real licensed fire trucks, the focus of Firefighting Simulator seems to be realism. That's good, and I approve—the developers tout realistic fire, heat, water, and smoke simulations using Unreal Engine 5's physics system... but I have a feeling that's not how it'll go once we all start playing it. Pulling off a fire and rescue using real-life strategies to succeed will surely feel like you and your buddies are a well-drilled team, but I think we all know that watching your friend fumble the key to climb a ladder with some hapless survivor slung their shoulder, them come tumbling several stories to the ground, will be slapstick hilarious. That aside, though, Firefighting Simulator: Ignite will have a career mode where you and your team regroup at the fire station as a hub to pick between eight characters, customize their outfits, choose equipment, and even learn new firefighting techniques like ventilation, demolition, heat control, and when to use foam rather than water. Firefighting Simulator will have crossplay between platforms, integrated voice chat, and support for modded custom missions made by players using mod.io. The mods will also be available to players on consoles. You can find Firefighting Simulator: Ignite onits official website, as well as onEpic GamesandSteam.

Eriksholm takes place in a fantasy vision of the early 1900s where a pair of siblings in trouble with the authorities get drawn into a deeper conspiracy. The city itself, inspired by Nordic cities of the time period, is as much a character as the people in it as you'll have to learn its layout and navigate its streets to find your missing brother.

Players will swap between three playable characters to solve situations and puzzles using each of their characters' unique skills. The levels are interspersed with richly lit and beautifully animated cutscenes to help move the story forward. \"We playtested the game a lot, and what people usually say is that it feels like I'm playing a movie, but in a great way,\" said River End Games Anders Hejdenberg in the Future Games Show segment. \"I'm really excited for players to just discover this world.\" You can findEriksholm: The Stolen Dream on Steam.

About three years ago Cory Davis, the creative director of Spec Ops: The Line, and Robin Fink, long-time guitarist with bands like Nine Inch Nails and Guns n' Roses, announced their game studio Eyes Outby doing some screeching in the California desert. Now we've got the impressively atmospheric trailer for Sleep Awake, a \"first person psychedelic thriller that explores the realm between slumber and death.\" It's coming sometime in 2026. \"I cannot sleep, I cannot sleep, I must not sleep,\" says the protagonist as we're shown psychedelic images of some otherworldly place that alternate with grim, grimy images that take place somewhere called the \"Somnological Institute,\" where I'm going to go ahead and hazard a guess that some really morally questionable experiments are taking place. \"Sleep Awake is an immersive first-person psychedelic horror narrative experience that explores the realm between sleep and death,\" reads the official description. \"Submitted to perpetual insomnia, the denizens of the last known city on Earth are reaching a panic crisis of reckless experiments in an effort to avoid The HUSH, the inexplicable disappearance of those who sleep. \"Playing as Katja, you must survive the devotees of various depraved death cults and desperately try to stay awake. Solve the puzzles of this mysterious world while avoiding the grasp of the death cults in an attempt to shatter the horrors of the past.\" I'm especially in love with this one detail of the trailer: Many of the images that seem to take place in a psychedelic world(s) are awash in pinks and violets and scarlets, which sure as a color palette is fine—but then just before the end of the trailer we get our desperate-not-to-sleep protagonist dropping a few vivid red-pink-violet drops into their eyes. It's a really well tied together bit of work. That aside we're got some real creepy dudes in masks, writhing greasy pale bodies, some torture, medical paraphernalia—nothing quite as grotesque asthat ILL trailerfrom Summer Game Fest on Friday, but all the hallmarks of some good, old fashioned horror thills.

    "article_text": "The trailer's worth watching just for the spaceship combat and low-G gunfights. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Surprise, Expanse fans—and congrats to sci-fi game fans in general—because developerOwlcat Gameshas just announced The Expanse: Osiris Reborn. The trailer was revealed at the start of theFuture Games Show, and you can watch it above. This'll be just the second videogame based on The Expanse after the Telltale release, and from the trailer it looks like it could be Owlcat's biggest production yet, as we see a gunship spin, flip, and burn to assault an asteroid base before the crew lands for a low-G ground assault complete with mag-locked boots and a bit of floating gunplay. It's been made with Unreal Engine 5. We don't know all the details of the plot yet, but at least one protagonist has UNN on their uniform, so they're working for the government of Earth. Osiris is an evil corporate element from Seasons 1 and 2 of the TV show or the early books—the ones experimenting on people with the alien protomolecule. (The game is specifically based on the TV show.) The gameplay sections of the trailer show off some cover-based shooting, with the character ducking behind cover and strafing while firing at enemies or lining up the area of grenade tosses. There's also some stylish-looking zero-G maneuvering between ships or stations shown off, complete with dodging flying debris heading your way. There's a definite Mass Effect vibe. Owlcat Games previously made videogame RPGs based on tabletop RPGs Pathfinder and Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader. They've been well-received, with Rogue Trader doing well enough that Owlcat will beadapting Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy next. Still, this must mean Owlcat is doing pretty well overall—they've got several projects in production at once already, and The Expanse: Osiris Reborn is yet another.

    "article_text": "It's time for the people to hold the rich and powerful to account. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. \"The river is a god, and they killed her\" is a hell of a way to start off a trailer, but that's how things get rolling in the new video for All Will Rise, which despite sounding like some sort of supernatural thriller is in fact a \"narrative courtroom deck-builder\" about ordinary people holding the wealthy and powerful to account for their actions. A trailer revealed during today's Wholesome Direct showcase gave us a look at what All Will Rise is all about. You are a lawyer in Muziris, \"a vibrant city under pressure by powerful corporate and political interests,\" and you've chosen a task that is not at all simple: Using unlockable cards earned by following leads and making choices, you must pursue a corrupt billionaire in court and hold him responsible for the murder of a river. \"Conversations are courtroom-style strategic card battles,\" theSteam pagesays. \"Charm and persuade, or intimidate and manipulate. Play cards to influence people’s emotional energies—Hearts, Minds and Guts. Engage their emotions, or exploit their vulnerabilities to make your points. Choose your strategy carefully, potential allies could easily turn into determined enemies.\" It won't be a clean fight in the safe, sterile confines of the courtroom, and tough choices will have to be made, with potentially devastating long-term consequences. \"Mix with ecoterrorists and godmen, capitalist overlords and construction workers, conspiracy theorists and hacker seeresses. Boost your reputation with the city’s quarreling factions—keep the balance, or let tensions explode.\" Your team will have to be carefully managed as well: Be aware of their strengths and weaknesses as you assign them to missions, respect their opinions, and don't push them too hard, lest they burn out. I'm not generally big on deckbuilders, but the narrative elements of All Will Rise make it immediately attractive: This is clearly a game with something to say, which is a little bit unusual in the realm of videogames. I dig the visual style too, and any game that lets me play this card is worth at least a second look: All Will Rise is currently up for wishlisting on Steam, and it's also headed toKickstarter.

    "article_text": "A collection of near-misses with Shai-Hulud. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Dune: Awakening's sandworms aren't just scary, they're the most brutally punishing feature of Funcom's new survival MMO. When you geteaten by a sandworm, you permanently lose all your stuff. Weapons, armor, tools, gear, your entire inventory gets swallowed up when Shai-Hulud sucks you down, and you can't go back and recover it. Even your vehicle is gone forever. That's why crossing the desert gaps between regions is so harrowing: the worm is always out there patrolling and your movements will bring it stampeding toward you, leading to lots of tense moments. Linger too long in the dunes and the sandworm will charge, its mouth the size of a train tunnel, gobbling down everything in front of it. So my new hobby is jumping onto the Dune subreddit every day to see some white-knuckle, butt-puckeringly close calls with sandworms. Knowing what's at stake, seeing a player flooring it across the desert with a worm barreling toward them, and jussssssst escaping to safety is utterly thrilling. Here's a few of my favorite sandworm close-calls. From HunwutP: Soooooo close. I love this video. You know you're in real trouble when the camera starts zooming out to show the full size of the worm that's eating you. The ridiculous airtime of that long bike jump as the worm jusssssssst misses its target is beautiful. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. FromLunchable-Toast: Just as with a bear, shark, or Jason Vorhees, you don't really need to be fast to escape a sandworm, you just need to be faster than one other person. From Sekhen: If you see the worm going after another player, that doesn't mean you're safe. Anything that gets in Shai-Hulud's way gets swallowed, including the unfortunate random player in the clip above. Shai-Hulud almost got a two-fer! From XirtCS: Tarry a bit too long while scrapping a crashed ship in the dunes, and Shai-Hulud will be along to swallow you and the wreck both. Luckily, the silly worm chose a poor spot to start its charge from and bonked its face against the rocks. Maybe next time! From Sekhen(again!): Talk about a rough night. First this player gets targeted by Sardaukar assassins, then downed—twice—while fighting them. Midway through the skirmish a sandworm breaches in the background, but the player is close enough to the rocks to not be in danger, and the worm vanishes. Surprise! It's suddenly back again, presumably to swallow the dead soldiers, missing the recovering player by maybe a foot or two. It's so close they're actually buried in the sand from the worm's breach. Yikes. Threw in my own encounter above, though I didn't escape through speed, I escaped by cleverly dying of other causes before the worm had a chance to eat me. After getting stuck inDune: Awakening's quicksand, my bike sank for a while as I fruitlessly and stupidly tried to gun the engine. Just as the worm appeared and headed my way, my bike exploded, killing me. I know it doesn't sound like a happy ending, but I only lost my bike and a couple resources from my backpack. If the worm had gotten me, I'd have lost everything. Thanks, explosions!

    "article_text": "I've been waiting for this moment. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Gecko Gods has released its first demo as part of the Wholesome Direct alongside showcasing a brand new trailer for the reptile adventure, and as someone who has kept an eye on the development of this game since 2021 I could not be more thrilled. It's been a while since we've received any sort of update on Gecko Gods, and a lot of my excitement probably stems from the fact the game wasn't scrapped entirely. But now, we've been given a release window of \"Fall 2025\" so I can finally start counting down the days until my dream of becoming a gecko and scampering around a larger than life world is within reach. In the new trailer featured within the showcase, we got a more in-depth look at the platforming and puzzle solving that makes up a lot of the experience, alongside numerous sweeping shots of the pretty, enchanting world our little Gecko selves will explore. Most importantly, though, we see the little Gecko we'll play as hop aboard a little boat and sail through different portals, which will transport us to new areas to explore. How exactly its tiny arms are capable of controlling a sail, I couldn't tell you. But I love it. Originally,Gecko Godswas supposed to launch in 2023, but it was hit with several delays and left with a \"coming soon\" label on Steam ever since. Every now and then a video or some screenshots would be published to social media, but no information on a release date has come out until now. In fact, prior to this announcement, the last update we received on the Gecko Gods was published to Steam in March this year, sharing that development was still underway. Thankfully, the Fall 2025 release window has reassured me that this epic reptile adventure isn't entirely out of reach anymore. Plus, with the demo (which I'm sure I'll explore every single inch of), I've got just enough content to keep me satisfied until I'm desperate for a bigger slice of Gecko Gods.

    "article_text": "Piece by piece you can pull this story together. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Instants, a story-rich puzzle game that tells its narrative through a series of family photo albums, has launched alongside the Wholesome Direct. Throughout the game you'll watch the family grow and experience significant life events like learning how to ride a bike, family vacations, and moving house. You know, all that sentimental stuff that brings a tear to your eye when you look back on it later down the line. As you stick down pictures and decorate your first book, you'll start getting letters from your family members showing an interest in your hobby for scrapbooking. You'll be asked to create scrapbooks for special occasions, and given more photos to work with, which unfortunately don't come with any sort of timeline for the moments they've captured. If you fancy it, you can switch off the need to place things chronologically and go into a more free game mode. However, it's not just about finding the solution and placing the photos correctly. You're also free to customize the experience by making your scrapbooks entirely your own. When you've solved the puzzle, you'll be able to decorate your books with different stickers, washi tapes, and all sorts of other items to give them a more personal touch. As a junk journal enthusiast myself, being able to decorate the whole thing is definitely the element I'm most excited about. As you complete pages, you'll also earn little tokens which can be exchanged for baked goods and beverages for your character to \"enjoy\" while crafting. There's no benefit to having these things unlocked, as far as I can tell from what I've seen in the trailer and experienced in the demo, but they do make for some aesthetic screenshots while you're decorating your pages. Completing an album or chapter of the story also unlocks more stickers and decorations you can use later down the line. Usually, these stickers and tapes will link to the theme for your next album, like snowflakes and pine trees for the winter holidays or airplanes when you start scrapbooking the first family vacation. Plus, to keep things relaxing, you'll be able to get some hints from a little on-screen cat too, should you find yourself stuck on a puzzle. Even though organising photos doesn't sound like much of a challenge on paper, I imagine as you get further into the story of the family and start to cover generations, the difficulty will ramp up.

    "article_text": "In case you don't trust your own instincts, let this game guide you. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. When Spring rolls around each year, so many people I know will flock to fields and forests to gather wild garlic. But, that's as far as their foraging goes. When woodlands are filled with mushrooms ripe for the picking, the same crowd of enthusiastic gatherers don't trust themselves to collect everything edible because there's more risk. Which is where a game like Out and About comes in handy, and thanks to a new trailer shown during the Wholesome Direct giving us a fresh look at the game, it's clear that we've got a lot to look forward to. Out and About is a typically \"cozy\" game that strives to take the pressure off foraging, giving you the same satisfaction of picking plants without running the risk of poisoning yourself and your friends. While you run around the world, you'll be challenged to find a huge variety of plants, flowers, and fungi based on the real thing. When it comes to picking them, you'll have to study them in-depth to make sure you've got the right thing before stuffing it into your woven basket and heading home, or giving them to the folks you meet around the town. When you're back from a hard day's work, you'll use what you've picked to make meals and herbal remedies which can also be recreated in real life, and the game gives you in-depth recipes for each item so you don't have to scour the internet looking for an equivalent either. Which is fantastic for anyone ready to stray from the annual tradition of making bucket loads of wild garlic pesto in favour of some brand new and equally as delicious recipes. The trailer shown during the Wholesome Direct also reveals a variety of different locations too which I imagine we'll get to forage from. For example, a dense woodland, open stretches of fields, and riverbank, all of which house a fraction of the 100+ forageable items within the game. The only downside though is unfortunatelyOut and Aboutdoesn't have any sort of release date yet. The new trailer shown during the Wholesome Direct did highlight that a playtest is now live, and with a demo already shared during the Steam Next Fest in February this year I don't think a release could be too far out of reach. But, it does give you a little more time to brush up on your knowledge of forageable fauna before diving into the deep end.

    "article_text": "Strategically stack ingredients to please hungry diners in Omelet You Cook. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Now that I've put asideBalatro(for now) andBlue Prince(for now), I'm on the lookout for the next creative and unusual roguelike. And I may have just found it: at Wholesome Games Direct today, there was a trailer for Omelet You Cook, a game where you make breakfast for a series of picky customers and try to avoid making your boss angry. Your boss is a massive chicken named Principal Clucker, by the way. And he doesn't like you very much. And here's the really good news: if you like the look of the trailer below, Omelet You Cook is out in early access on Steam right now. I've played it a bit this week, and I'm pretty smitten with the lo-fi looks and surprisingly challenging cooking system. You'll begin with a conveyor belt of ingredients and an omelet to add those ingredients to, and an eager customer who demands you make them breakfast that scores over a certain point threshold. The ingredients slide in front of you and you pick one to add to the omelet, then get three more to choose from, and so on. Each ingredient has a point value and some synergize with each other. Green peppers, for instance, are worth zero points alone, but each slice of bacon touching one awards you three extra points. Mushrooms are worth a whopping seven points—as long as absolutely nothing is touching them. As your omelet fills up with ingredients, it becomes almost like a stacking or packing game. How much can you cram on top of this omelet while maximizing your score? Omelet customers can be quite demanding: imagine facing a new boss blind in Balatro not every three rounds but everysingleround and you'll have some idea of the challenges you face. One customer gave me a negative multiplier for every piece of meat in the omelet, which was a problem because I was going with a bacon-heavy strategy in that session. Another customer was a DJ, which meant the omelet slowly spun while I was trying to assemble it: that made it really tricky to arrange my ingredients just so. Even the ingredients themselves can be tricky. Between rounds I spent some of my earnings to buy seafood to use in my omelets, which have a chance to be \"wiggly.\" A squid suddenly beginning to squirm around and nudge other ingredients out of place can be a problem if you're dealing with a customer who requests that no ingredients be hanging off the side of the omelet. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. It's compelling, though! Unlike a lot of roguelikes where I shrug and start over when I fail, I find myself deeply invested in crafting omelets that will please customers and avoid me getting yelled at by the massive, angry chicken I work for. If you don't score enough points, Principal Clucker will appear, gobble down all the omelets you made, lay some heavy criticism on you (\"This is pathetic.\"), and end your game. On the plus side, if you get far enough he'll grant you a new ingredient that may appear in future sessions. I'll be right back: I'm gonna cook up some more omelets and make that giant chicken proud. You'll find Omelet You Cookon Steam.

Powerwashing is great, but sooner or later everything is clean. And yeah, it'll get dirty again one day and you'll be able to leap back into industrial cleaning action, but what to do until then? Here's one idea:Blowing leaves. Leaf blowers in the real world are a scourge upon humanity: Howling noisemakers that irritate everyone with a 100-yard radius while doing a worse job of getting the leaves off your grass than a simple rake. But inLeaf Blower Co., an upcoming leaf-blowing sim with a demo out now on Steam (PC gaming—we've got it all) that dropped a trailer at today'sWholesome Direct showcase, it's an entirely different matter. The leaf blowers are oddly quiet, for one thing, and that sucks a bit of the realism out of the experience (although maybe that's just for the benefit of the trailer), but the annoyance factor is also significantly lessened. Even better, if you get bored halfway through the job you can just quit and go do something else without worrying about your dad yelling at you. Also unlike working for your dad, you'll be paid properly for your efforts. Just look at this: That's $1.2 million for a few hours of blowing leaves! If I could earn that kind of living clearing off lawns in the real world I might change my opinion about the accursed things. Ah well. All that sweet green will enable you to buy new tools and upgrades, expanding your capabilities and your earning potential. But it's not just about money. It's tranquility, you see—becoming one with the cosmos of your yard, your playground, your neighborhood park, or wherever the leaves (that is, the Leaf Blower Co. campaign) may lead. And of course there are all sorts of secrets, bonus objectives, and Easter eggs to discover, as well as a free play mode that lets you go where you want, and do what you want. (As long as what you want to do is blow leaves, more or less.) Leaf Blower Co. channels a seriousPowerWash Simulatorvibe, which may be its biggest attraction. PowerWash Simulator is an unexpectedly compelling game—\"theperfect counter to the stress of Elden Ring,\" PC Gamer's Sarah James wrote in 2022—but it's also getting a bit long in the tooth. For anyone looking for a similar sort of experience but different, Leaf Blower Co. might just be it. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. A release date for Leaf Blower Co. hasn't been set but it's expected to be out sometime in 2025. For now, it's up for wishlistingon Steam—and better, there's a newly-released demo you can take for a spin too.

    "title": "I'm quitting PC Gamer to run a vending machine empire in the back streets of Japan after my idle game obsession shadow-dropped at the Wholesome Direct",
    "article_text": "Sometimes you just have to abandon your day job for something new. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I'm sure that owning an enterprise of vending machines in Japan probably hasn't ever climbed onto your lifelong bucket list. It definitely wasn't anywhere on mine. But after spending more time than I'd like to admit in Vending Dokan!: Kozy Kiosk, I'm starting to think it's a business I should tap into. I played the demo of Vending Dokan back in February, and quite happily tended my business for as long as it would let me. In fact, I wished there was slightly more I could've done once the demo came to a close. So when the Wholesome Direct announced that Vending Dokan!: Kozy Kiosk would be available immediately after the showcase, it was hard not to want to continue my endeavours into the world of vending drink supply immediately. Restocking machines and ordering in new drinks doesn't sound like it could make for a fun game on paper, I know. But thanks to its idle format that lets it tick away in the background while you focus on something else and only occasionally check in, hours will slip by as you watch over your little vendo in an alleyway. Every now and then you'll have to restock your machines or get in some new beverages to keep your customers happy, but outside of that it's a very hands-off game. If you do want to get a little more out of the experience rather than just letting it do its own thing, you can spend the money you earn from selling drinks on decorations for your alleyway. Things like lights and benches will help improve the \"vibe\" of your space and invite more people to spend longer there (and hopefully buy more drinks.) You also need to consider the cleanliness of your space. If there isn't a bin nearby, people are more likely to throw their empties onto the floor. So, there's actually way more to it than just focusing on the selling aspects, although of course you can just leave it be as soon as you start. You'll still make money. But it will be a lot more efficient if you put some more character into your space. To make the game more typically cozy, a lo-fi soundtrack plays while the game is open, making it the perfect work companion. If you're lucky, you'll also get the ambient rain that occasionally rolls in for that ultimate laid back experience too. Vending Dokan!: Kozy Kioskmight not stand out as a must-play straight away, but if you need a little something to sit in the background while you work, it's surprisingly addictive. It's as serene as you can expect watching over an alleyway in Japan can be, but it has left me with a hankering for a Pocari Sweat and several tabs open linking to vending machine auctions.

    "article_text": "Sounds cute, can't guarantee it won't be terrifying though. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Haunted Paws has received a new trailer as part of the Wholesome Direct this year, giving a further look into what the life of a puppy trying to track down their owner would look like. Except it's not your normal manhunt; you'll have towork your way through a haunted houseinstead. At least you don't have to do the whole thing alone though. Oh no, you'll need to enlist the help of a friend to come along with you. You'll both need to work together to solve the mystery of where your human friend has ended up, and won't be able to do simple things like opening doors on your own. Instead, these things all require two sets of paws. So, be sure to pick someone you really enjoy playing games with because things could get a little frustrating otherwise. Outside of solving the overarching problem, Haunted Paws gives you plenty of smaller challenges to complete as well, such as marking your territory 30 times. You know, all that good dog stuff. There are plenty of cute interactions for you and your puppy pal to unlock and break up the spooky environments too. Most importantly though, you can fully customise your puppy. You'll be able to select the breed and change the fur colour, all the way down to the collar, letting you bring your own dog to life in the game. Though, if you stuck my pomeranian in a haunted house I'm pretty sure he'd just sit by the door and cry until it all blows over. Which isn't too dissimilar from what I'd do, really. Although no release was announced, a closed alpha is happening right now to coincide with the Wholesome Direct. Hopefully we start to see more information about Haunted Paws after a few people have had the chance to hop in, because this seems like one of those games that will descend friendships into chaos for the sake of becoming a dog for a little bit.

    "article_text": "Gourdlets Together means you can enjoy the easygoing sandbox with pals. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Ever since the sandbox city builder Gourdlets was released last August, the most requested feature players have been asking for is co-op. After almost a year, Gourdlets Together has now been announced with a new trailer as part of Wholesome Direct. It's a multiplayer spin-off that lets you and your friends come together for an all new experience set in the vegetative world of Gourdlets. In Gourdlets Together, you'll be able to enjoy the city builder elements of Gourdlets with a whole island to design and customize. But you'll also be able to invite your friends to come and hang out while you do. Rather than making homes for Gourdlets, you can build places for your friends to chill in. Most importantly though, you and your friends can fish while you hang out, which seems to be a significant selling point for Gourdlets Together. After the success of Webfishing, a game where you and many others come together with the sole intention of fishing, I can see Gourdlets Together becoming quite popular because of this. I for one can't resist a fishing minigame, that's for sure. As you make your way through the game you'll earn rewards you can exchange for new improvements for your island too. These include everything from house plants to tables and chairs, and even little hats for your Gourdlet which you can customise. Thankfully, we won't have to wait too long for the release of Gourlets Together either. The trailer shown at the Wholesome Direct shared that the game is \"coming 2025\" and is already available to wishlist on Steam. From what I've seen, it seems pretty fleshed out. Even though there's no concrete release date yet, it seems like we'll be able to fish with our friends sooner than we think.

    "title": "Criminally underappreciated survival game Abiotic Factor is leaving early access with an update that adds buildable office cubicles and a spooky library",
    "article_text": "The final early access chapter launches this summer. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I strapped on my crampons for an initial peek at Abiotic Factor'sCold Fusion update back in April, but at the time it wasn't wholly clear how it would tie into the run up to the game's 1.0 launch. Now though, developer Deep Field Games hasstated explicitly that Cold Fusionisthe 1.0 launch, and that the new area the update adds—the Residence Sector—will represent the final chapter of Deep Field's survivalist tribute to Half-Life. Alongside clarifying this detail, Deep Field's second Steam update about Cold Fusion provides more information about what players can expect from this last chunk of Abiotic Factor. We already know that the Residence Sector is heavily inspired by Half-Life's 'Office Complex' chapter, but Abiotic Factor takes its representation of administrative life several steps further than Valve's classic FPS. For starters, the Residence Sector includes a sub-area called The Praetorium, which appears to be a spooky archive area prowled by monkish \"Clericum\". Moreover, Cold Fusion will let you build your own slice of bureaucratic paradise, introducing buildable office cubicles empowered by atomically accurate grid-snapping. Rigid object alignment will apparently be exclusive to cubicles for the time being, but Deep Field says that \"maybe other things\" will become snappable in the future. Elsewhere, Cold Fusion will allow players to source sustenance from the Taco Mine. Unfortunately, this is merely the name of the Residence Sector's taco stall, and is not an actual mining complex for the extraction of fossilised Mexican food. That said, thisisAbiotic Factor we're talking about, so I wouldn't rule out the possibility that the Taco Mine runs deeper than is initially apparent. Other new features include a craftable decontamination unit called the R.A.I.N. shower, which will wash off the blood, grime, and anomalous substances your lab coat accrues as you explore. Finally, the Cold Fusion update will add two new storage options. As the name implies, the compact crate will help you cram more loot into a smaller volume, while the void chest provides access to a pocket dimension you can store things in, then access from any location where another void chest is crafted. Abiotic Factor still doesn't have a precise release date, but it's still targeting summer of this year. Which, given that it basically is summer, means it should arrive pronto. It's also worth noting that the 1.0 release won't necessarily represent the end of your journey through the G.A.T.E. research facility, as Deep Field is already teasing a 1.1 update coming later in 2025.

    "title": "Forever Skies developer responds to 'significant' disappointment with the survival game's launch: 'It's tough to see that the game didn't meet the expectation of so many players'",
    "article_text": "\"Good or bad, our intention has never been to walk away\". When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Forever Skieswas one of the more intriguing early access survival projects that sprawl across Steam like a forest of (choppable) trees. The premise was basically \"What if Subnautica, but in the sky?\" which given Subnautica is one of, if notthebest survival game in existence, is a pretty exciting concept. Plus, you get to build and fly your own airship, and who doesn't want to do that? It all seemed to be going to plan too, at least if you go by the game's 'Very Positive' overall Steam rating. But it seems the launch version has gone down like, if not quite a lead balloon, then certainly iron or yellow brass. Forever Skies' recent reviews currently sit at a 'Mixed' rating with players complaining about repetitive exploration, a lack of depth to the story, and just not much to do once you've got the basic survival loop mastered. There's a sense that developer Far From Home had opted to wrap the game up quickly and write it off. But now the studio has issued an update to stress that is not the case. Ina Steam post titled \"The Future of Forever Skies and Patch\", it acknowledges that \"a significant part of our player base has been left disappointed with the game\", after which CEO Andrzej Blumenfeld addresses the situation: \"It’s tough to see that the game didn’t meet the expectations of so many players since we poured our hearts into it, and still it fell short in ways that matter,\" Blumenfeld writes. \"But good or bad, our intention has never been to walk away from Forever Skies, so we are for sure not going to call this 'good enough' and just move on. We’re here to do the work, make the game better, and show you that we’re listening.\" The statement is followed by a bar chart identifying the key areas players complain about (which, fair play, I haven't seen in a Steam update before), which highlights technical and performance issues alongside repetition and dull mechanics. Far From Home says it will focus on improving those areas in upcoming updates, but that it also wants to \"open up the discussion\" and hear more from players. As for the patch, Far From Home explains it focuses on issues the studio was working on \"before we properly identified the four key areas of improvement\". As such, the additions and changes are small and sporadic, such as improvements to certain animations, adding aim assist on controllers for the game's crossbow weapon, new loading screens and an alternative death screen, and a bunch of bug fixes. I have played the launch version of Forever Skies, and I'm inclined to agree with the negative reviews here. The airship itself is great, fun to pilot and with an excellent building system attached. And there are a couple of neat moments in the story, like the first time you descend from your airship to Earth's now-inhospitable surface. But it undoubtedly struggles to make its airborne setting interesting, with you mostly flying between variations of ruined towers. I'm pleased Far From Home is committed to improving it, but there's a lot of work to be done if it is to become the Subnautica of the sky.

    "title": "No, Geoff Keighley—Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was not made by a team of 'under 30 developers,' and devs say repeating the myth is 'a dangerous path'",
    "article_text": "SGF's fascination with small staff sizes discredits the integral work of external contractors and contributors. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. While opening last night'sSummer Game Fest showcase, host and Game Awards founder Geoff Keighley noted how 2025 has been marked by the surprise successes of smaller game projects. Alongside \"indie creations\" that \"stand side by side with heavyweights,\" Keighley shouted out Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 from Sandfall Interactive, which he called \"a monumental achievement\" made by \"a team of under 30 developers.\" Given Clair Obscur'scritical receptionand itsmillions of sales, it's compelling to think that fewer than three dozen people could produce such a success. That \"under 30 developers\" figure has circulated in conversation and coverage—it's a claim we quoted from the game's creative director inour own pre-release reporting. It's an inspiring idea. It's also factually incorrect. If you seek out avideo of Clair Obscur's credits(viaRock Paper Shotgun), you'll find that—to its credit—Sandfall's core development team does indeed number around 30 people, a small studio by industry standards. But the in-house Sandfall staff compose less than half of the game's credits runtime, the rest of which is devoted to \"production partners\"—the kinds of external contractors and contributors that today's games industry relies upon. Clair Obscur's credits include dozens of contributors: a team of Korean gameplay animators, QA staff from Polish firmQLOC, porting support fromEbb Software, performance and compatibility analysts fromHuwiz QA/UX, audio producers and vocal performers fromSide UKandStudio Anatole, localization staff fromRiotloc, voice actors, performance capture artists and specialists, musicians, choir singers, retail distributors, interns, playtesters, mock reviewers, and more—all of whom were responsible, in part, for Clair Obscur's quality, character, and global success. Acknowledging those contributions detracts nothing from Clair Obscur's achievement. It is, by an overwhelming majority of accounts, a good-ass videogame, and Sandfall's core team should be celebrated for that. But misrepresenting the scale of its production, intentionally or otherwise, draws an implicit distinction between what does and doesn't qualify as \"real\" game development. If you're justifiably annoyed when a game launches as a buggy mess, you should want the contributions of QA testers, who do the complex work of identifying those bugs before release, to be properly credited and valued. Otherwise, that integral labor—in QA, in localization, in compatibility testing—is seen as disposable, a perception that contributes toabusive working conditionsin overseas contractor studios and drivesrecent unionization efforts in the US. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Game developers on Bluesky have reacted with frustration and discomfort to SGF 2025's preoccupation with mythologically small dev teams. \"It's incredibly noticeable how often 'and an army of outsources outside America and Western Europe' is left out of these team sizes,' said game director and Bithell Games founderMike Bithell. \"That's the part I find real uncomfortable.\" Balatro creator Localthunk noted how he, too, is often credited as the \"one guy\" who made Balatro, which he says contributes to a \"David vs. Goliath narrative\" that's been oversimplified. TVGS, the developer of Schedule 1, was also shouted out as \"a solo developer\" by Keighley during last night's SGF. Schedule 1's in-game credits show that art and music were provided by two other contributors. \"No it was not 'one guy',\"Localthunk said. \"Look at the dang in-game credits.\" \"I was really uncomfortable with this as well. And not just because the math doesn’t math. One dev plus nine friends working with him is 10 people… not one,\" said games licensing producer and consultantMike Futter, referencing a moment at SGF when Keighley described upcoming brawler Acts of Blood as made by \"a solo developer in Bandung, Indonesia with the help of nine of his friends.\" \"Expedition 33 is a triumph, but it wasn’t made by 30 people. Contractors provided vital labor. This is a dangerous path we’re walking,\" Futter said. It's not hard to imagine ways in which repeating the myth of Clair Obscur's team size could contribute to worse conditions for games and the people developing them. If publishers and investors are convinced that games like Expedition 33 were made with only 30 developers, they'll be less inclined to support the necessary staff and production budgets that development projects require—regardless of whether it's true.

    "article_text": "Bigger fish to fry. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Look, I'm not a big fan of fishing minigames for a whole bunch of reasons. But I am deeply fond of abysmal puns. So on that basis alone,Fallout 76's Gone Fission update gets a pass from me. But this exquisitely/terribly titled addition to Bethesda's multiplayer Fallout does more than let you yoink marine life out of its irradiated water bodies. It also brings a significant overhaul to the game's combat, andthathas my attention. Before all that, though, fishing fans can get their rod on by visiting a new location in the Mire. Imaginatively called Fisherman's rest, here you'll encounter a character known as The Fisherman (really stretching your vocabulary there, Bethesda). The Fisherman will give you the Casting Off questline, through which you'll acquire a fancy new fishing rod. You can fish anywhere in Fallout 76 that's wetter than a puddle, but your basic fishing rod won't be able to catch more than generic tiddlers and pieces of junk. To hook more elusive quarry, such as rare axolotls and radioactive glowing specimens, you'll need to upgrade your rod by completing fishing challenges and daily quests, while also gathering higher-quality bait. Weather can also affect your chances of a better catch, so you're more likely to snag rarities when it rains, catch glowing fish in a radstorm, etc. The update also lets you cook fish and gear up with a wide range of maritime-themed apparel and equipment. If you're looking for new digs, meanwhile, you can set yourself up in a houseboat, furnish it with fishing rod displays and bottled octopi, outfit your character in scuba gear, and pass the time testing your strength on the Poseidon Arm Wrestling machine. None of this really bites for me, but as I mentioned, Gone Fission adds more than just fishing. Apparently, Bethesda has been working on an extensive combat rebalancing project since last year, and the Gone Fission update adds alotof weapon tweaks as part of that. There are far too many changes to go into in any detail here, but I'll give you the broad strokes. Many weapons have had their base damage increased, including a wide array of rifles and SMGs, and more than 50 melee weapons. Alongside guns and bludgeoning implements, various perks and weapon mods have also been rebalanced, with the latter seeing a general shift toward making them more powerful. One of the more specific changes the update makes is to limb damage and crippling. Now, instead of certain weapons and mods having a percentage chance to instantly cripple a limb, they will deal more consistent increases to damage that culminates in crippling. \"We expect that these changes will make most enemies easier to cripple while making limb damage more consistent and predictable,\" Bethesda explains, though the changes will make the appendages of some enemies, like region bosses, harder to disable overall. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The Gone Fission update is available now. Fallout 76 has come a long way since itsinfamously empty launch in 2018.

    "title": "Geometric factory sim Shapez 2 just got a massive update that adds 3D construction and better trains, and it's also 30% off until next week",
    "article_text": "Shaping up. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Shapez 2 has quickly established itself as one of the better factory sims to roll off the games industry's colossal imagination assembly line. A more focussed, yet still expansive game of automation and optimisation, Shapez 2 gives you the scale ofFactorio, but removes concerns like building-destroying enemies and paying for structures with resources. Released into early access last year, it was already an accomplished affair, but now it hasreceived a substantial updatethat lets you shape your factory in whole new ways. The Dimension update relates not to the mysterious cosmic hole that your factory feeds an endless churn of LEGO-like studs into, but instead refers to the fact you can now build in 3D. This was possible to a limited extent previously—you could construct buildings on multiple levels—but the update extends this feature to foundational platforms, conveyor belts, pipes, and rails for trains. On the subject of trains, the update improves these mechanical beasts of burden in numerous ways. Visually, it expands the colour palette for locomotives to help you differentiate them at a glance. At a mechanical level, the update adds transfer stations, which let you shift resources directly from one train to another, as well as two new types of train station. The first of these are \"quick stops\", which only stop trains that can load or unload instantly, while \"wait stops\" allow a train to load and unload for up to 30 seconds. Other additions include a tweak to launchers—which fire your shapes over other assembly lines for more efficient factory layouts—to let you customise their range to a certain extent. There are also new platform types and a more efficient method for searching for shapes on the map. Finally, the interface has received a significant overhaul, with new hotkeys for game functions and improved contextual placement, such as launchers being laid out automatically when dragging the cursor across existing conveyor belts. All this arrives alongside visual improvements and an array of bug fixes. It's a respectable extension of the game's systems, although developer tobspr Games stress that all this comes at a small cost. While savegames from the previous version are compatible \"with a few caveats\"—mainly requiring you to replace any tunnels you had in your factory, any savegames older than that will not be compatible at all. Tobspr notes that \"you can load them into the 0.0.9 branch on Steam first and then import them into this update if you really want to continue them\", but it sounds like you'd be better off just starting a new game. To coincide with the update, tobspr Games is alsorunning a 30% discountuntil Tuesday, June 10, bringing the price down to $17.50 (£14). So if you've been curious about the game up to this point, but decided 25 dollars was a little steep for an early access title, now might be the time to take the plunge. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "Nightreign's distilled shot of Elden Ring juice makes it my ideal level of soulslike investment after 14 years of getting good",
    "article_text": "The best balm for soulslike fatigue, it turns out, is a roguelike. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I've fallen off of soulslikes. Not because of a lack of appreciation: I'll always treasure felling a FromSoft boss so I can snatch up their soul, read the item description and wonder what all those proper nouns might mean. It's a problem of exhaustion. The cracks first started showing in Sekiro—watching Guardian Ape stand back up after being decapitated is something I'll never spiritually recover from—butElden Ringfinally confirmed that I'd burnt out my soulslike stamina. A string of botched corpse runs and bungled attempts at fighting the duo boss in the Auriza Hero's Grave made me place my controller down and ask myself: What's the fun I'm getting out of a soulslike nowadays? We have only so much time on this earth, and I have spent my share on getting good. The shine of getting good had worn off. When I first tried Dark Souls, it was out of curiosity: I wanted to see if I could wrap my head around a game that was kicking so many asses and drink in FromSoft's fiction along the way. When I started Elden Ring, I was just as interested in seeing a new world's worth of the item descriptions, the boss and equipment designs, the breadth of spells and weapon arts available and the builds they could make. But after finishing three Dark Soulses and a Bloodborne, whether or not I could beat a boss wasn't a particularly compelling question anymore. There, somewhere below Leyndell, I admitted to myself that after slaying any boss in Elden Ring, I wasn't feeling satisfaction. Mostly, I was just feeling relief. It meant I didn't have to spend more time proving, once again, that I can figure out when to dodge, and could continue with what I was actually interested in. I still loved—and love—the weight and deliberate action of FromSoft's combat design, but today, it's a love anchored in the sheer variety of viable playstyles it offers. That variety is hard to sample when you're repeatedly slamming your head against a boss, or expending a finite respec item to try a new build, or grinding for upgrade materials so your cool new weapon is actually usable. We have only so much time on this earth, and I have spent my share on getting good. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Enter Elden Ring Nightreign. In Elden Ring proper, the arc of a character's progression is dozens of hours long. In Nightreign, it's roughly 48 minutes. In a single play session, I might jump between three playstyles: If I'm feeling like some tried-and-true greatsword swinging, Wylder's on deck. I can do some dex-y spellsword action with Duchess, or swap to Recluse to go all-in on sorceries. Nightreign isn't a flawless experiment: Even after some rebalancing, solo play is still a crapshoot, and the time pressure of the battle royale-style circle means I've had runs where I didn't have time to properly admire a build I'd cobbled together. In a perfect world, I'd prefer an Elden Ring roguelike where I could set my own pace. Nightreign takes the Elden Ring experience and distills it down into a single, swiggable shot. But the run-based structure and randomization means the only barrier for experimenting with the huge variety of FromSoft's combat arsenal is firing up a new expedition. Whenever I crack open an equipment chest or see a boss's drops, I'm sticking my hand in the Elden Ring toybox and seeing what I can make with whatever I pull out. I've had back-to-back runs where Guardian went from wielding a pair of flaming halberds to being a lightning-throwing warpriest. With an auspicious set of weapon arts and incantation buffs, I've turned dainty Revenant into a melee behemoth. In one of my successful kills of the final Nightlord, I was playing Raider—but instead of swinging a colossal weapon, I was firing greatbow arrows backed by a build stacked with ranged attack damage. Nightreign takes the Elden Ring experience and distills it down into a single, swiggable shot. It won't—and shouldn't—take the place of a traditional soulslike experience, but I'm at a point where I want to spend more time playing with what's available than proving how good I've gotten. Nightreign lets me enjoy the FromSoft juice without having to bear the weight of soulslike fatigue.

    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. FortniteChapter 6 Season 3is out now. The game is back online, as downtime came to an end early. The last season just concluded with an epicStar Warslive event, which then showed Superman as the theme for the new season. Next Season release dateWhat to expect from the new seasonTrailerJump to Live Coverage as it happened Epic Gameshas been busy teasingthe next season ofFortniteover the last week or so, and now we've finally got the full details onFortnite Super. There's a whole host of Hero Items to try out, as well as new locations to visit on the map. Personally, I really enjoyedFortniteGalactic Battle, with the blaster-only weapon pool being a refreshing change from the norm. Things have changed significantly with the new update, as regular guns and ammo are back in the loot pool. In my opinion, the recent changes have absolutely been good enough to keepFortnitein TechRadar'sbest free games list. Here's TechRadar's coverage of the launch ofFortniteChapter 6 Season 3, including info on Fortnite Super. Now that it's live, you can check out how we reacted to the update as it happened. Only have time for the basics? Here are the most important things to know aboutFortnite Chapter 6 Season 3: Fortnite Superdropped on June 7, after an epic Star Wars-themed live event. OUT NOW. Hey Fortnite, eyes up here 👀 pic.twitter.com/U8v2SAxBNfJune 7, 2025 We now know of Robin, and other Battle Pass characters like Superman, Haylee Skye, Ziggy, Synthwave, Killswitch, Lightrider, and Morgan Myst. There's a whole host of changes to the map too, including Supernova Academy, Demon's Domain, and Utopia City as new major POIs (Points of Interest). There's Hero caches, and a ranking system that lets you rise through the ranks to get better gear. Read the full details over at theFortniteblog. The cinematic trailer forFortniteSuper debuted shortly before the update landed. It shows Superman catching a falling Battle Bus, in thefalloutfrom the live event. Robin and Superman are now confirmed as Battle Pass skins, alongside new characters. There was also a full cinematic gameplay reveal, which is embedded above. Here, you'll see some of the new abilities in action, including Robin's Grapnel Gun, and Krypto's Treat. As a freelance games writer, it's my job to stay up to date with the latest games, especially live service titles likeFortnite. I've put hundreds of hours into the game at this point, having jumped on duringFortniteVibing. Since then, I've particularly enjoyed theFortnite OGseasons, which gave me the opportunity to experience older seasons ofFortnitethat I missed the first time around. As for what comes next, I'm excited to check out the new Superman-themed map locations. And so begins my live coverage of the upcomingFortnitelive event, the following downtime, and the launch of a brand new Season. Death Star Sabotage starts at 11AM PT / 2PM ET / BST, so not long now to wait. While you’ll need to wait a little longer to actually jump into Death Star Sabotage, the queue will open at 9AM PT / 12PM ET / 5PM BST. I recommend joining this as soon as you can after it goes live, as queues have been long enough in the past that it’s been possible to miss the event completely. A brand new trailer for Death Star Sabotage aired last night (June 6) at The Game Awards. It sets the stage for an epic space battle, as players race to destroy the Death Star. Primarily, it looks as though this will be a vehicle-based fight, though there's a tease in the trailer showing that you and your squad might kick off the event imprisoned somewhere inside the Death Star. Before Death Star Sabotage, the Star Wars season approaches its end with special log-in rewards for all players. Log intoFortnitebetween June 3 at 9 AM ET and June 10 at 9 AM ET to immediately receive the Assault on the Death Star Loading Screen and Captain Phasma’s personal melee weapon: the Quicksilver Baton Spear Pickaxe. Fortnite Galactic Battlecomes to an end later today, but there’s still a few hours left for you to play. Currently, a Star Destroyer portal will spawn once per match, allowing you to take control of the hulking spacecraft’s turbo-lasers. This gives you a bird’s eye view of the map, marking nearby enemies and giving you time to blast them from above. This is a seriously powerful bonus to have, setting you up nicely for the final couple of circles. There’s just a few hours left to redeem Battle Pass rewards. The final section gives you an Emperor Palpatine skin, as well as a Force Lightning emote. It’s almost time. Text the group chat, prep that mobile download, and arrive early for our live event.\nDeath Star Sabotage begins TOMORROW at 2PM ET.\n📲 : https://t.co/HQu3pYCXFm pic.twitter.com/sbwkrzpig2June 6, 2025 Epic Games is keeping quiet onFortniteChapter 6 Season 3, presumably because it’ll arrive shortly after the Star Wars live event ends. In previous seasons, there’s been a few hours of downtime between the end of a live event and the start of a new update. I’ll be sure to update you live as Epic details downtime, and how long it’s expected to last. Death Star Sabotage just appeared in the Discover menu in Fortnite. This allows you to secure your spot before things start in two hours. It's highly recommended you do so, so you don't miss out on the action. You can now join the Death Star Sabotage playlist, and better yet, there's a pre-event mini game to try out too. It tasks TIE Fighters with eliminating X-Wings while protecting a Star Destroyer. X-Wings on the other team have to race to blow it up before losing too many ships. Playing as an X-Wing in this mini game sure is difficult. At present, it all feels very weighted against the Rebellion, with teams rarely making it past the first stages of Star Destroyer defenses. Maybe this is the point? Hopefully to make the event feel like a bigger victory later on (assuming the good guys win, of course). You’ve prepared all season and now it’s time to take on the Empire in Death Star Sabotage, event starts TODAY at 2PM ET! Queue up early, you won’t want to miss this. pic.twitter.com/Szrxp1YTAnJune 7, 2025 A new event teaser just dropped on the Epic Games Twitter account. It shows iconic Star Wars characters gearing up for a big battle. A little over an hour to go now! We actually destroyed both shield generators, and most of the bridge. It seems the trick is to shoot small asteroids to reveal powerups. The blue boxes grant shields, and the red boxes seriously boost your damage. We're aware some players may be seeing matchmaking errors when trying to enter the early Death Star Sabotage fight and are actively investigating.\nIn the meantime, entering another game mode and switching back to Death Star Sabotage may help resolve this. pic.twitter.com/mSsnaKKAgAJune 7, 2025 There's reports of players having matchmaking issues when trying to join Death Star Sabotage. Epic Games recommends switching to another mode, then switching back to Death Star Sabotage. The main Death Star Sabotage event will start in just fifteen minutes. Make sure you've loaded into the lobby if you haven't already. Alright, last call. Head into the Death Star Sabotage lobby now if you want to get in for the live event. Just five minutes to go now. And I'm in! looks like we'll be posing as TIE Fighter pilots to start the mission from within. Things are kicking off with choosing a Stormtrooper disguise. Now we're inside, the goal is to smash generators with pickaxes. In true Fortnite style, it's all running smoothly so far. We're now armed with blasters, and have encountered the first enemy resistance as X-Wings battle overhead. The Emperor has arrived to battle. And has immediately taken away our guns. Ultimate power indeed. After an intervention from Hope, we rifted away as the Death Star exploded. Then, the camera panned out, showing Superman overseeing the battle. An end screen shows that Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3 will go live in just under six hours. Fortnite is currently down. This follows the epic Death Star Sabotage live event, which ended with an estimate on when Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3 will arrive. If things pan out, you'll be able to jump back online at 7PM PT / 10PM ET / 1AM BST (June 8). So far, we don't know much about the next season of Fortnite, only that it'll arrive later today. Superman has been revealed, so it looks like the rumors of a \"Super\" season theme are correct. Before the new season launches, you'll want to head onto your platform of choice and check for an update. I just got one on PS5, which is 20.147GB in total Now that we're in downtime, it'll be five hours until the game is back online and playable. I'm headed off for a break, but I'll be back in the hours leading up to the launch of Chapter 6 Season 3 to cover any news that's revealed. Fortnite's new season launches in just 3 hours. While I was away, Epic revealed an intro cinematic, and the title card image. It looks as if Fortnite Super is the next update, with Robin, Superman and other superheroes taking the lead. Epic Games has revealed the intro cinematic trailer for Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3. It shows the fallout from the end of the live event, and Superman catching a falling Battle Bus full of new characters. Robin is the latestFortnite Supercharacter to be revealed, and interestingly, it's the Tim Drake version. I'm betting there's more heroes to come, probably as one of the mid-season mini Battle Passes that have become the norm recently. Fortnite Superjust got fully revealed. There's new POIs like Supernova Academy and Utopia City, Hero items that power up your abilities, and even a Krypto dive-bomb item. You can check out the full details on theFortnite blog. Hero Caches can be found all over the new map, though the loot they contain will be dependent on your Hero rank. You rank up by eliminating enemy players, surviving Storm phases, taking a Sprite to a Shrine, and eliminating henchmen. Interestingly S Rank Hero Caches can contain Unstable Exotics. One is called the Unstable Yoink Shotgun, and whoever it hits with the first shot from a full clip will be yoinked towards you! The new map forFortnite Superfeatures a mix of Star Wars locales, superhero areas, and some zones that we've seen in previous Chapter 6 seasons. Demon's Domain is one of the brand new POIs, and it'll be occupied by the henchmen of Mask Maker Daigo. If you try to log intoFortniteright now, you'll be met with a \"servers not responding\" error message. Don't worry, this is all normal during downtime. There should be just two hours left until the game goes back online. Fortnite Super is now online, earlier than we predicted. You can now check out the full Battle Pass, with the first reward being Robin. Before you load into your first match of Fortnite Super, be sure to check out the update notes shown above. These detail the Hero Rank system, which allow you to get access to progressively better gear as you rank up. Supernova Academy is full of great loot, especially if you're at Hero Rank B or higher. There's doors you'll be able to open after being scanned, most containing Hero Items. I received the Bass Boost from this one, which was great for traversal and destroying buildings. The Tracking Visor is a Hero Item that's already proving to be extremely useful. It periodically sends out a pulse that marks nearby enemies. You can also see their footprints to help track them down. Superman has his own mini Battle Pass, and it'll unlock on July 11. So far, only the standard skin is viewable, but there will be other rewards too. We'll have to wait until closer to the release day for more info on exactly what all the rewards are. As promised, a new update for Nintendo Switch 2 has dropped. Players have already been able to jump into the enhanced version, but now mouse controls have been added. You'll get the Wishing Star Emote for logging on with Switch 2 by March 31, 2026. That concludes my live coverage of the Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3 launch. I'll be back for the next Season, covering all of the ongoing changes to the map, the Battle Pass, and more.

    "title": "Gamers, let's not pretend PS Plus and Xbox Game Pass multiplayer subscriptions are okay – they're exactly why PC gaming is arguably cheaper in the long term",
    "article_text": "Prove me wrong... When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's been a long while since I took a huge and ambitious leap into thegaming PC ecosystem, and with it have come plenty of highs and lows. As one who also plays games on console, specificallySony'sPS5, it was incredibly frustrating to go from a simple start-up and play design, to then deal with file tinkering and adjusting other PC settings. However, once I became accustomed to this and also learned about the benefits of the platform, notably that PC multiplayer was free (as it should be), it became my primary gaming station. Unfortunately, that's not the case with consoles. BothMicrosoftandSonyhave long introduced multiplayer subscription plans, throughXbox Game PassandPS Plus, respectively, which means console gamersmustsubscribe to either, in most cases, to play games online (excluding free-to-play titles like Fortnite). Now you may read that and say, \"Well, it's been like this for years, and it's normal, right?\" The former is right, yes, but the latter statement explains the issue in a nutshell. Ever since this online paid subscription model was introduced to console gaming, it's sadly become normalized by gamers and just brushed aside as something that justhasto be done. So much so that it's now at the point of no return, as it's become a standard for years. Simply put, we all already pay for an internet service to use across multiple devices, especially access to the internet on PCs. If there's a new online game I'm looking forward to, I can easily purchase it and dive right in with no extra required charges on platforms like Steam, Battle.net, or theEpic GamesStore. So if that's the case, why the exception with consoles? It ultimately brings me to the understanding that PC gaming is a cheaper expense in the long term versus consoles. Still with me? Good, I'll explain why. While I've recently encouraged console gamers to stay away from PC, due to the ridiculous price inflation of GPUs, it still doesn't change this point; gaming PC hardware is more expensive than consoles, yes, butactuallybeing able to play games is cheaper. On PC, gamers have access to a variety of inexpensive games, either through Epic Games Store's free releases (also Prime Gaming) or online key marketplaces like CD Keys, offering new games at significantly lower prices. I can't remember the last time I've had to pay full price for a single game, and part of that includes some of Steam's generous sales. Now, there are console games available on key sites, and dare I sayplentyfor Xbox consoles – but that's far from the same story for PlayStation games. There are few games at key retailers, and if there are, they're often old titles that appear months after launch. What's worse is that Sony's PlayStation store hardly hasanysteep sales, and old games tend to stay at their original retail prices, even years after launch. If you don't believe me, take a good look atGod of War Ragnarok, a 2022 game that's still $69.99. Essentially, it's either you pay up (which could potentially be $80 soon) or be forced to await a rare and enticing discount for a game, since the industry is infamously moving away from physical copies. At least with physical copies, this wouldn't be a big issue, as prices would vary, and you can't have the game taken away from you at any moment – but that privilege is slowly fading away. I held onto myRTX 3080 Tifor 4 years, after initially buying it at £1,099 (equivalent was $1,199), its original retail price, closer to the end of its life cycle in 2021. Despite the terrible PC ports of recent years, I could have easily continued withNvidia's RTX 3000 series GPU (especially now withDLSS 4) if I hadn't had the privilege of being offered an upgrade. My point is that while buying high-end hardware is expensive as a bundle, it can last you longer than console generations without needing an upgrade, while games aren't nearly as expensive as those on console, specifically, Sony's PlayStation systems. The thing is, consoles are creeping up on PC pricing, with the PS5 Pro at $699. And of course, there's the elephant in the room, which is PS Plus and Xbox Game Pass. The former's base subscription plan, which is known as 'Essential', costs $59.99 a year, just a few dollars short of what you would pay for the standard edition of a newCall of Dutygame at $69.99. You throw in the cost of the service and the game, and you're paying $129.98. It gets worse with the 'Premium' plan that essentially replicates Xbox Game Pass, but without day one titles, and it costs $119.99. Do you see where I'm going with this? I can vouch forMicrosoft's Game Pass service, which provides plenty of new games day one for both console and PC players, and that doesn't happen with PS Plus – and in all honesty, its monthly games are lacklustre. That doesn't make it any better, though, as you still need to pay for Game Pass Core to play online on console. However, PC players also don't have to rely on Game Pass for new games and can find inexpensive alternatives. There's little reluctance when purchasing cheaper PC games, and I don't get that same feeling with my PS5; it's got nothing to do with being \"broke\", but instead knowing what's worth purchasing and what isn't. If pricing is what has deterred you from building a gaming PC, then just know that the first and biggest hurdle will be the pricing of hardware.

    "title": "Cybercriminals love this little-known Microsoft tool a lot - but not as much as this CLI utility for network management",
    "article_text": "Hackers are abusing this built-in Windows utility daily When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A new analysis of 700,000 security incidents has revealed just how extensively cybercriminals exploit trustedMicrosofttools to breach systems undetected. While the trend of attackers using native utilities, known as Living off the Land (LOTL) tactics, is not new, the latest data from Bitdefender’s GravityZone platform suggests it’s even more widespread than previously believed. A staggering 84% of high-severity attacks involved the use of legitimate system binaries already present on machines. This undermines the effectiveness of conventional defenses, even those marketed as thebest antivirusorbest malware protection. Some of the tools most commonly abused will be very familiar to system administrators, including powershell.exe and wscript.exe. However, one tool unexpectedly emerged at the top: netsh.exe. A command-line utility for managing network configuration, netsh.exe was found in a third of major attacks - and while it is still used for firewall and interface management, its frequent appearance in attack chains suggests its potential for misuse is underestimated. PowerShell remains a key component of both legitimate operations and malicious activity - although 96% of organizations use PowerShell, it was found running on 73% of endpoints, well beyond the scope of what would be expected from administrative use alone. Bitdefender found, “third-party applications running PowerShell code without a visible interface” were a common cause.

This dual-use nature makes detection difficult, especially for tools not backed by behavior-aware engines. It raises questions about whether thebest EPPsolutions are adequately tuned to account for this blurred line between normal and nefarious use. Another surprising finding was the continued use of wmic.exe, a tool that Microsoft has deprecated. Despite its age, the analysis shows it is still widely present in environments, often invoked by software seeking system information. It is particularly attractive when attackers are trying to blend in because of its legitimate appearance. To tackle this issue, Bitdefender developed PHASR (Proactive Hardening and Attack Surface Reduction). This tool employs a targeted approach that goes beyond simply disabling tools. “PHASR goes beyond blocking entire tools, it also monitors and stops the specific actions attackers use within them,” the company said. Still, this approach is not without trade-offs. The fundamental dilemma, “can’t live with them, can’t live without them”, remains unresolved.

    "title": "This Mac mini M4 docking station can add 16TB of storage to your beloved Apple mini PC - but it comes with a big flaw",
    "article_text": "You wouldn't know it was a separate product thanks to the matching all-aluminum design When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Beelink Mate minidocking stationoffers Mac mini M4 users a sleek way to expand both connectivity and storage. Designed to matchApple’s compact desktop, it attaches underneath the Mac mini, maintaining a tidy footprint while adding additional functionality. At its core, the Mate mini supports Thunderbolt 5 with 80Gbps data transfer speeds, allowing for fast external SSD performance and seamless device connectivity. There are two models on offer. Model A features dual PCIe x2 M.2 slots and supports up to 16TB of storage. Model B offers a single PCIe x4 slot that delivers higher speeds, up to 6228MB/s read, but with less total capacity. That trade-off highlights the dock's main drawback. To reach the full 16TB, you need the version that uses PCIe x2, which is slightly less efficient than the x4 configuration. For most users, this is unlikely to create any real issues. That said, professionals working with massive files or needing the fastest transfer speeds might feel the pinch. Aside from storage, the Mate mini delivers a full range of ports. These include a 2.5Gbps Ethernet port, USB-A 3.0 ports, an SD 4.0 card reader, and a 3.5mm audio jack. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! A Type-C PD port also allows power delivery for peripherals that exceed the Mac mini’s built-in 15W output. Two Thunderbolt 5 cables are included in the box. A quiet fan and 360° cooling vents help keep the system cool and stable, even during heavy use. The all-aluminum design is finished in silver to match the Mac mini and weighs just 250g. Priced at $279(down from $339), the Mate mini targets users looking to extend their Mac mini’s capability without taking up extra space. It may not be perfect, but it does fill a useful role for those seeking extra ports and storage. Wayne Williams is a freelancer writing news for TechRadar Pro.

    "article_text": "AI agents need to be monitored just like regular employees, report warns When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Despite growing enthusiasm for agentic AI across businesses, new research suggests that the rapid expansion of these tools is outpacing efforts to secure them. A SailPoint survey of 353 IT professionals with enterprise security responsibilities has revealed a complex mix of optimism and anxiety over AI agents. The survey reports 98% of organizations intend to expand their use of AI agents within the coming year. AI agents are being integrated into operations that handle sensitive enterprise data, from customer records and financials to legal documents and supply chain transactions - however, 96% of respondents said they view these very agents as a growing security threat. One core issue is visibility: only 54% of professionals claim to have full awareness of the data their agents can access - which leaves nearly half of enterprise environments in the dark about how AI agents interact with critical information. Compounding the problem, 92% of those surveyed agreed that governing AI agents is crucial for security, but just 44% have an actual policy in place. Furthermore, eight in ten companies say their AI agents have taken actions they weren’t meant to - this includes accessing unauthorized systems (39%), sharing inappropriate data (33%), and downloading sensitive content (32%). Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Even more troubling, 23% of respondents admitted their AI agents have been tricked into revealing access credentials, a potential goldmine for malicious actors. One notable insight is that 72% believe AI agents present greater risks than traditional machine identities. Part of the reason is that AI agents often require multiple identities to function efficiently, especially when integrated with high-performanceAI toolsor systems used for development and writing. Calls for a shift to an identity-first model are growing louder, but SailPoint and others argue that organizations need to treat AI agents like human users, complete with access controls, accountability mechanisms, and full audit trails. AI agents are a relatively new addition to the business space, and it will take time for organizations to fully integrate them into their operations. “Many organizations are still early in this journey, and growing concerns around data control highlight the need for stronger, more comprehensive identity security strategies,” SailPoint concluded.

According to a source \"with a proven track record\" in contact withMacRumors, every watch that's able to runwatchOS 11is also going to be able to run watchOS 26, so there won't be any devices that are left behind this year. That meansApplesmartwatches as far back as theApple Watch Series 6(launched in 2020) and the Apple Watch SE 2 (launched in 2022) are going to be eligible for the new update, as well as all the watches launched since. If you remember back to last year, after the announcement of watchOS 11,we heard from Applethat the Series 5, Series 4 and the original SE wouldn't be getting the 2024 update. This time around, all the currently supported devices are included. Apple hasn't said anything officially yet about watchOS 26 – not even that it's on the way or that it's getting a rebranding – but we've heard plenty of rumors about what the upcoming software update might be bringing with it. As is mentioned in the same MacRumors article, there's a prediction that watchOS 26 is going to offer support for third-party shortcuts on the watch Control Center for the first time, which should mean an improved experience for users. A new and improved visual interfaceis apparently on the way too, which would follow the lead of visionOS, with plenty of transparency and frosted glass effects.

What's more, you can make up to four mistakes, which gives you a little bit of breathing room. It's a little more involved than something like Wordle, however, and there are plenty of opportunities for the game to trip you up with tricks.

    "title": "'One of the hardest moments to film': Ballerina's most simple action sequence on paper ended up being the most challenging for a big reason, director says",
    "article_text": "Exclusive: 'I lost count of how many times we had to glue them back together' When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. From the World of John Wick: Ballerina's director has revealed which fight sequence was the most challenging to film. Speaking to TechRadar ahead ofBallerina's June 6 release, Len Wiseman admitted \"one of the hardest moments\" of the entire shoot is one that audiences won't expect it to be, either. Full spoilers immediately followfor the Ana de Armas-led action thriller. Do not proceed unless you've watched it. Okay, which set-piece caused the most headaches? It's got nothing to do with the third act's lethal flamethrower-based sequence. Act 1's nightclub brawl, a classic staple of theJohn Wickmovie series, wasn't as taxing as the scene that Wiseman has in mind, either. According to the filmmaker behind one of June 2025'snew movies, the most difficult moment to capture was part of the alpine restaurant duel between de Armas' Eve Macarro and a member of the cult led by Gabriel Byrne's Chancellor. The reason it was so challenging? The plates, which Eve and her fellow combatant attack each other with during a smirk-inducing sequence, kept breaking when they shouldn't have. \"The restaurant fight is a favorite of mine because there were a lot of important story beats that were landing, and it was incredibly fun to shoot,\" Wiseman told me. \"But the plate sequence was one of the hardest moments to film. They're breakaway plates, so they have one job [to break upon impact without hurting the actors], and they do it well. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. \"The problem is, when you pick them up, they immediately shatter. So, they [the actors] had to delicately pick up each one and then bring them down on their opponent with real force. The amount of times they grabbed a plate and they'd shatter... I lost count of how many times we had to glue them back together. I remember the props department asking me if 100 plates would be enough, and I said 'yeah'. Well, we went through all 100 plates multiple times, so you can imagine what state they were in when we were done!\" Understandably, each action sequence in the fourth John Wick film (chronologically, anyway – read myJohn Wick movies in orderguide for more details) came with its own set of challenges. That included the one-on-one between Eve and Keanu Reeves' iconic hitman, which takes place inBallerina's final act. \"That was an incredible day on the set,\" Wiseman said of shooting the confrontation between Eve and the franchise's titular assassin. \"It's a moment in the movie that's really fun and tense, but we were well aware that we needed to ensure there was a balance to the fight. John Wick is the so-called Baba Yaga, and while he's more experienced and skilled than Eve, we didn't want her to feel upstaged in her own movie. So, we wanted her to hold her own at times, and for this fight to have a purpose for what he's offering her in terms of her character development. It's not just a fight, it's a fight that has meaning.\" Ballerinais out now in theaters worldwide.

    "article_text": "Influence seems to be more valuable to creators than money When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. An increasing number of YouTubers are allowing AI companies to train models using their videos, and surprisingly, many are doing so without direct compensation. UnderYouTube’s current setup, creators are given the option to opt in by ticking boxes that grant permission to around 18 major AI developers. If no box is selected, YouTube does not permit the use of that video for AI training purposes. This means the default stance is non-participation, and any inclusion is fully voluntary. The lack of payment may seem unusual, and the motivation appears to hinge on influence rather than income. Creators opting in might see it as a strategic move to shape how generative AI tools interpret and present information - by contributing their content, they are effectively making it more visible in AI-generated responses. As a result, their work could shape how questions are answered by everything fromAI writerstolarge language models (LLM) for coding. Oxylabs has now launched the first consent-based YouTube dataset, comprising four million videos from one million distinct channels. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! All contributors explicitly agreed to the use of their content for AI training, and according to Oxylabs, these videos, complete with transcripts and metadata, have been carefully curated to be particularly useful for training AI in image and video generation tasks. “In the ecosystem aiming to find a fair balance between respecting copyright and facilitating innovation, YouTube streamlining consent giving for AI training and providing creators with flexibility is an important step forward,” said Julius Černiauskas, CEO of Oxylabs. This model not only simplifies the process for AI developers seeking ethically sourced data but also reassures creators about the use of their work. “Many channel owners have already opted in for their videos to be used in developing the next generation ofAI tools. This enables us to create and provide high-quality, structured video datasets. Meanwhile, AI developers have no trouble verifying the data’s legitimate origin.” However, broader concerns persist about how government organizations and legislatures handle similar issues. For instance, the UK’s Data (Use and Access) Bill has stalled in Parliament, prompting figures like Elton John to criticize the government’s handling of creator rights. In this legislative vacuum, creators and developers will likely face uncertainty. Oxylabs presents itself as filling that gap with a consent-based model, but critics will still question whether such initiatives genuinely address deeper issues of value and fairness.

    "title": "China is racing ahead with sodium-ion batteries – as sea salt becomes the power source for its electric scooter revolution",
    "article_text": "Sodium is 400-times more abundant than lithium When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The presence of sodium in batteries is nothing new, as the first documented use of it dates back to the 1960s, when the Ford Motor Company considered using them for very early EVs. But last year, Chinese automaker JAC (a joint venture with Volkswagen in China) produced the world’s first sodium-ion battery production car in the Hua Xianzi (it roughly translates to 'Flower Fairy'), which uses a tiny 25kWh sodium-ion battery that can travel up to 155 miles on a single charge. While not exactly a global sales success, the technology has found a place among China’s booming microcar economy and, perhaps more important still, its rampant demand for diminutive two-wheeled scooters. In somewhere like Shenzhen, a megacity with a population of some 17.8 million people, the humble scooter is one of the most popular forms of transport, with over 55 million sold in 2023 alone, and Yadea is among the most popular brands. The global leader in electric two-wheelers has released three sodium-ion powered electric scooters to date, according to theBBC, with plans in the pipeline to offer a lot more. These battery packs are constructed in a similar way to their lithium-ion counterparts, but transfer sodium ions between electrodes during charging and discharging, rather than other rare earth materials. Currently, lead-acid batteries continue to dominate the electric scooter landscape, as the technology is cheap and produced on a mass scale, but the demand for sodium-ion units is gradually increasing. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. By 2030, 15% of China's electric scooters will be powered by them, compared to 0.04% in 2023, according to ananalysisby the Shenzhen-based Starting Point Research Institute, which assesses China's battery industry. Electric two-wheel manufacturer Yadea is also building out one of the most robust electric scooter charging networks in China, with plans to install more than 1,000 fast-charging pillars that have been specifically designed for sodium-ion batteries this year in Hangzhou, which would enable commuters to find a station every 2km (1.2 miles). It is also pushing forward with a massive battery swap program in Shenzen, with an aim of 20,000 swapping stations this year, which allow riders to replace a spent battery for a fully-charged unit in around 30 seconds. This number will grow to 50,000 by 2027. Right now, sodium-ion batteries are still very much in ascendance, as the price, and demand for lithium-ion units, has dropped since its all-time high post-pandemic. A relatively low energy density (somepitch sodium-ion batteriesas being 30% less energy dense than lithium-ion counterparts) has also put off the major automotive players, all of whom are constantly looking for the lightest, most energy dense options on the market. But China’s vision for salty batteries goes well beyond transport, with theBBC reportingthat it is already on track for mass-scale sodium-based energy storage solutions, which help balance the grid and store excess energy from renewable sources when not in use – all without competing with the auto industry and its voracious appetite for lithium.

    "title": "I’m not interested in the Switch 2 - but there’s one game that will make me open my wallet",
    "article_text": "I won’t be buying a Switch 2 yet, and here’s why When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Look, I love myNintendo Switch. It’s a great little device - hell, I might not have made it through the pandemic lockdowns with my sanity intact had it not been for the lovely, calming influence ofAnimal Crossing: New Horizons. So it’s fair to say that I’m interested in theSwitch 2, but I won’t be getting one on launch day for one very simple reason. Where’s my damnPokémonlaunch title, Nintendo? With every new console generation, I sit and eagerly await the possibility that you’ve finally learned your lesson and decided to put a mainlinePokémongame in the launch lineup. And with every new console generation, I am disappointed. The closest we’ve ever come wasPokémon Dashfor the Nintendo DS, which was more of a glorified tech demo for the new handheld’s dual-screen mechanics than a fully-fledged game. I’ll admit it, I’m that type ofPokémonfan who complains about how crap the modern games look and run, but then merrily presents my credit card whenever a new one comes out. Does that make me a hypocrite? Probably, but I don’t think it’s unreasonable to both love something and also wish it were better. In any case, aPokémonlaunch title for the Switch 2 would have me lining up to get my hands on the new console - but as it stands, I’m just not interested. If I can be frank for a moment here, the Switch 2 launch lineup is… pretty feeble, honestly. What do we have? A heap of triple-A third-party games are being re-released, but theunspectacular footage ofCyberpunk 2077running on the new consolehasn’t exactly lit a fire underneath me. Some OG Switch upgrades for an extra ten bucks - oh wow,Pokémon Scarlet and Violetdoesn’t run like garbage now? Great, I’msoooimpressed. We’ve got some smaller series titles and a smattering of first-party names headlining, but arguably none of the biggest franchises. Forgive me for not being uncontrollably excited aboutPuyo Pop Tetris 2S. We’re getting a newMarioKart, but no mainlineMariogame.SuperMarioParty Jamboree,Donkey Kong Bananza,andPokémon Legends: Z-Aare all inbound, but not for a few months - oh, andZ-Awill be available on the Switch I already own, though it’ll probably look terrible. A newZeldagame is nowhere in sight, andMetroid Prime 4is, uh… well, it’s coming, but only Samus knows when. I’d like to take a moment to remind you that it’s beeneight whole yearssince that game was originally announced - and it's also a Switch 1 game too. Very cool, Nintendo. It’s something of a recurring theme for Nintendo, frankly. Launch lineups have rarely been impressive for the gaming giant’s consoles; almost half of the Wii launch titles were mediocre movie and TV show tie-ins, while the two biggest DS launch titles werebothNintendo 64 remakes (MarioandRayman). To be clear, I’m not saying those remakes were bad, but come on. I’ve been trying to understand the logic behind Nintendo’s consistent refusal to includePokémon- which, lest we forget, is the single biggest intellectual property on the planet, worth more thanCall of Duty,Warcraft, andGrant Theft Autocombined - in the launches of its consoles. On paper, it makes zero sense. I have some theories. First up is that Nintendo’s hardware development team simply doesn’t have the sway with the many-headed serpent of corporations that jointly manage thePokémonfranchise (Game Freak, The Pokemon Company, Creatures Inc.) to ensure that a new title is always ready for the relevant console launch. Another theory is that Nintendo intentionally uses newPokémonreleases to bump post-launch sales of its consoles, or spaces out those third-party games to prevent attention from being split by a newZeldaorMariotitle. I’d love to believe that the main reason is simply that Game Freak would rather spend a bit more time with the hardware to release a game that looks and runs great, but… well, let’s be honest, that seems unlikely. In truth, it’s probably a combination of all these factors and more, never to be properly understood by mere mortals like us. All I can really say is this: Nintendo, if you hadPokémon Tides and Gales(or whatever it’s called) to launch with the Switch 2, it would sell better. Simple as that. I’d buy it immediately; I was one of the six people who bought both aPokémon Mini. I’m not hard to please. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

    "article_text": "Lots to look forward to When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. WithApple WWDC 2025now just a couple of days away, we're seeing a rapidly increasing number of leaks around iOS 26 (the rumored new name for iOS 19) – and in the opinion of TechRadar readers, one of these rumors is much more exciting than the rest. Over 1,000 of you responded to a poll onour WhatsApp channel– which is well worth signing up to for the latest tech news and chat – to say that you were most looking forward to the visionOS-style redesign that's been predicted for the iPhone. This redesign has been leakedby Mark Gurmanat Bloomberg, who is usually one of the more reliable tipsters when it comes toApple. Apparently the iOS interface will be more transparent, more modern-looking, and more glass-y – just like visionOS. It's a visual overhaul thathas been teasedby Apple's own official invite forWWDC, and 43% of our respondents say it's what they're looking forward to the most when it comes to reveals we're anticipating this coming Monday. Second place in our poll, with 17% of the vote, went to the rumored AI optimizations that will extend iPhone battery life. More battery life is always welcome, and apparently iOS 26 is going tomake efficiency improvementsbased on how you use your handset. The stats show 12% of our readers are most excited aboutthe live translation featuresthat are said to be coming to the AirPods with the next software update, while 11% of you are most looking forward to therumored new gaming hubthat's supposedly on the way. Rounding out the poll, we havethe CarPlay redesign(9%),the polls feature in Messages(5%), andthe simplified Camera app(3%).

    "article_text": "Hasselblad could finally get up to speed When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If money were no object, the stunningHasselblad X2D 100Cwould probably be my first choice ofcamera for photography. The minimalist 100MP medium-format camera's looks, handling, and image quality are top drawer. It's far from the perfect camera, though. I don't mind that it's a photography-only camera (that's right, no video recording capabilities whatsoever). But what did spoil my experience somewhat was its sluggish autofocus performance during testing – a drawback that could be addressed with its rumored upcoming successor. MirrorlessRumorshas flagged an FCC application for a Hasselblad X2D 100C II, which not only contains the first proper images of the second-gen model but also outlines various new features. Chief among those is LiDAR autofocus. Should an upcoming Hasselblad X2D 100C II gain LiDAR autofocus, it would represent the first meaningful update courtesy ofDJIsince the Chinese-tech giant andleading drone makeracquired Hasselblad, and it couldn't have picked a better upgrade. I love the X2D 100C II's image quality, so much so that itputs my full-frame Nikon camera in the shade. However, unlike my humble Z6 II, I couldn't rely on its autofocus for sharp focus where it wanted it, such as a person's eyes in a portrait. Yes, improved autofocus tops myX2D 100C II upgrade wishlist, and the promise of pricey LiDAR autofocus, which is utilized by DJI'sRonin 4Dand will presumably deliver a huge boost in autofocus performance, is exciting news. Elsewhere, the new images reveal a new joystick control and refined button layout, while internal SSD storage could again be up to 1TB, together with a CFExpress B card slot. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Otherwise, I'm not expecting many other meaningful improvements, not that many were needed – the X2D 100C II will seemingly feature the same or similar 100MP sensor with class-leading 8EV in-body image stabilization, 16-bit color depth and 15-stops dynamic range, for probably the best photo quality you can get on the affordable side of $10k / £10k. Depending on how you look at it, the rumored X2D 100C II is a minor update of the X2D 100C. But for me, it looks set to fulfill my \"if I had one wish\". How does the rumored X2D 100C II sound to you? Let me know in the comments below. Tim is the Cameras editor at TechRadar.

    "title": "CarPlay could soon get these two upgrades with iOS 26, but I'm still more excited about CarPlay Ultra",
    "article_text": "A new UI is inbound, but Ultra is the way forward When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Appleis due to announce some updates to its CarPlay infotainment software at itsWWDC 2025event next week, with the next major iOS release scheduled to feature a number of in-car changes. Apple has been relatively slow at releasing CarPlay updates over recent years, with only the addition of an extra row of icons appearing for those lucky enough to sport enormous, portrait infotainment displays in their vehicles. It appears thatCarPlay Ultra, which expands the CarPlay experience to the driver display and was recently announced by Aston Martin, has been the focus of the Californian tech giant’s attentions. But next week (specifically, Monday June 9) could bring some welcome news to those of us who have to make do with good old-fashioned CarPlay, as Apple is rumored to be refreshing the look of itsoperating systemacross all devices with iOS 26, including those that are tethered to a vehicle’s head unit. Details remain scarce, butMacRumorsreports that the new UI will feature a more \"glass-like, Vision-OS-inspired design\", alongside some new accessibility features, such as the ability to activate a Large Text option and the expansion of Sound Recognition for CarPlay. This feature was launched withiOS 18last year and can alert passengers or drivers who are deaf or hard of hearing to horns or sirens outside of the car, as well as detect babies crying within the vehicle, highlighting this with a notification on the screen. While the introduction of an overall design change and some new accessibility features are likely just the tip of the Apple CarPlay update iceberg, it is difficult to see how any further tweaks can better what the company has achieved with CarPlay Ultra. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Finally, the system allows the sort of control over key car functionality (without having to leave the CarPlay ecosystem) that many drivers have been demanding for years. Porsche introduced a sort ofCarPlay Ultra-litewith the launch of its new Macan, butAston Martinis the first to relinquish full control of its digital displays, including those in front of the driver. Purists will argue that Aston has perhaps lost a certain charm with the disappearance of beautiful, hand-finished analogue binnacles, but it is difficult to get away from the user-friendliness of CarPlay Ultra's UI. The ability to display the mapping application of your choosing in glorious resolution before the driver’s eyes is a delight and the option to tweak vehicle safety settings without leaving CarPlay just makes sense. Without the automotive manufacturer’s permissions, it will be very difficult for Apple to implement these sort of features in any upcoming generic CarPlay update. But we do know that the likes of Hyundai, Kia, Renault, Porsche and Ford are all in line to receive CarPlay Ultra in the near future. Let’s just hope Apple reveals some juicy CarPlay user-experience features to make up for the fact we can't all afford new, expensive cars. Stay tuned for our fullWWDC2025 coverage next week.

    "title": "‘Bone-crushing’ Russia sanctions bill could crush US trade – Politico",
    "article_text": "The passage of a new US sanctions package on Russia could disrupt America’s relationships with its biggest trade partners and isolate it from the world’s leading economies, Politico reported on Saturday. The proposed bill includes a steep 500% tariff on imports from any country that continues to buy oil, gas, uranium, or other key commodities from Moscow. Among those most affected would be India and China, which together account for approximately 70% of Russian energy exports. Several other nations that import Russian energy and uranium could also be subject to the bill’s penalties. Imposing 500% tariffs on Chinese-made imports would likely trigger a surge in consumer prices, severely disrupt supply chains, and potentially push US unemployment to levels associated with a recession, Politico noted. The sanctions could be described as targeting the US itself since the country continues to rely on enriched uranium imports from Russia for its nuclear power sector. And it could effectively isolate the US from many of the world’s leading economies, including its European allies, the article says. US Senator Rand Paul wrote in the publication Responsible Statecraft that the bill“essentially amounts to an embargo”and could trigger“economic calamity on a scale never before seen in our country.”He added that such punitive measures are unlikely to change Moscow’s core strategic goals and only further entrench the US in a“failing”foreign policy approach. The sanctions bill was introduced in early April by a bipartisan group of senators led by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal. In addition to 500% tariffs, the measure includes secondary sanctions targeting countries that maintain commercial ties with Moscow. Graham recently proposed amendments to exempt countries providing military aid to Ukraine from the tariffs. The change would shield the EU, which continues to import gas from Russia. The senator described the bill as“one of the most draconian sanctions bills ever written”and the sanctions as“bone-crushing.” Russia has consistently criticized Western sanctions, calling them illegal, and maintains that they have failed to inflict lasting economic damage. In March, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that a total of 28,595 sanctions had been imposed on Russian companies and individuals in recent years – more than the total number on all other countries combined. According to the president, the West sought to eliminate Russia as a competitor, but its economy has only grown more resilient under pressure.",

    "title": "Russia accuses Ukraine of self-genocide in feud over troop remains",
    "article_text": "Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has branded Ukraine’s failure to receive the bodies of its fallen soldiers an act of self-genocide, accusing Kiev of turning its back on its own people in both life and death. During talks between the two sides in Istanbul on Monday, Moscow decided to return the bodies of over 6,000 Ukrainian soldiers in a unilateral humanitarian gesture. However, Russia’s top negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, said on Saturday that the Ukrainian team failed to show up when the first batch of remains was delivered to the exchange point on the border between Belarus and Ukraine. Zakharova took to Telegram later on Saturday to slam the deliberate inaction of Vladimir Zelensky’s government, saying that it“does not need its people; neither dead nor alive.” “There is no nation or ethnic group in the world that would refuse to bury its soldiers. But there is the Kiev regime, which professes a misanthropic ideology and is committing genocide against its own people,”Zakharova wrote. Russian MP Dmitry Belik, who is a member of the State Duma’s International Affairs Committee, told RT that one of the reasons for Ukraine failing to accept the bodies of its soldiers could be its unwillingness to pay compensation to their families. “This is how – thinking of how to stuff their own wallets and not give a penny to their citizens – the Kiev regime, led by Zelensky, pursues its bloody policy and destroys its own people,”Belik argued. Former Pentagon analyst Michael Maloof also suggested that Ukraine’s decision could be rooted in financial concerns.“I think they are embarrassed by the numbers,”he told RT.“I’ve heard sums up around more than a billion dollars that they would have to repay to families – and they don’t have the money,”he added. The chairman of the Russian parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee, Leonid Slutsky, told RT that the move by the Ukrainian authorities is an example of“rare cynicism and a disregard for the memory of their own fallen servicemen.” “In a war to the last Ukrainian, they are exclusively focused on preserving their own power, even at the cost of actual sacrilege,”Slutsky said. Kiev explained its refusal to collect the remains of its troops by claiming the date of the transfer had not yet been agreed upon.",

    "title": "Musk deletes Trump-Epstein post",
    "article_text": "Elon Musk has deleted an X post claiming that US President Donald Trump’s name was in the sealed Jeffrey Epstein files, suggesting that this is the real reason they remain classified. On Thursday, Musk wrote:“Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public.”He added:“Have a nice day, DJT! Mark this post for the future. The truth will come out.” In another inflammatory post no longer visible in the entrepreneur’s X account, Musk responded“yes”to a message that said“Trump should be impeached”and Vice President JD Vance“should replace him.” The businessman has not commented on the issue yet. Both posts became part of a public feud between Trump and Musk. During last year’s election, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX set up and funded a pro-Trump political group, donating over $260 million, and was appointed in January to co-lead the newly established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), tasked with reducing federal bureaucracy and wasteful spending. Musk stepped down last week. The rift started after the billionaire condemned Trump’s massive tax-cut bill, which is estimated to add $2.4 trillion to the $36.2-trillion US debt over 10 years, calling it a“disgusting abomination.”The US president then threatened to cancel federal contracts with Musk’s companies. The clash then escalated into a series of jabs on social media. Musk accused the president of“ingratitude”and threatened to paralyze the US space program by decommissioning the Dragon spacecraft. Trump, for his part, said that the tech billionaire had gone“crazy”and claimed that Musk was actually upset because he“took away his EV Mandate.” Following the feud, Tesla’s shares dropped by about 14.2% on Thursday at market close, wiping roughly $152 billion off the value of the company. Trump Media stock also fell 8%. Trump had previously pledged to declassify the Epstein files, and in February, US Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the release of the“first phase”of documents. However, key materials – including flight logs, client names, and contact lists – have remained under seal, fueling speculation about who could be implicated. Epstein, an investment banker with deep connections to political and business elites, was arrested in July 2019 on federal sex trafficking charges. He died the following month in a New York jail in what was officially ruled a suicide, though his death instantly sparked widespread controversy and conspiracy theories.",

    "title": "Israeli cabinet minister tells banks to ignore EU sanctions",
    "article_text": "Israeli banks should provide services to settlers whom the European Union has slapped with sanctions, despite any potential repercussions, the country’s Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has insisted. He warned that those failing to comply could be made to pay out hefty compensations. Last July, the EU for the first time in its history imposed punitive measures on five Israeli settlers and three groups over“serious and systematic human rights abuses against Palestinians”in the occupied West Bank, which is considered part of Palestine under international law. Apart from an EU-wide entry ban and an asset freeze, the sanctions prohibit the“provision of funds or economic resources, directly or indirectly,”to the affected Israeli nationals. In a post on X on Wednesday, the official, who is known for his far-right views, said that he had sent a letter to the banking supervisor, Dani Khachiashvili, in which he demanded an end to“the ‘zero risk’ policy on the part of banks, which leads to the abandonment of Israeli customers under the guise of compliance with foreign sanctions.”Smotrich accused Israeli financial institutions of“small-mindedness”and unquestioning compliance with“unjust”EU sanctions. He argued that banks in fact“have a significant ability to act against”Brussels’ punitive measures, by taking legal action and wielding their“global economic connections.” The official threatened that if his call was not heeded, he would push for legislation that would force Israeli financial institutions to pay out sizable compensations to the affected individuals. The Israeli finance minister further wrote that he could also promote legislation that would require the Bank of Israel to“open and manage bank accounts for citizens on whom sanctions are imposed.” Speaking to AFP last month, Swedish Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard said that Stockholm would“push for EU sanctions against individual Israeli ministers”since there was no“clear improvement for the civilians in Gaza.” At around the same time, her Slovenian colleague, Tanja Fajon, announced that her country was“looking into the possibility of sanctions against Israel, alongside France and Ireland.” Also in May, the UK and Canada, which are not part of the EU, along with France, issued a joint statement condemning the ongoing Israeli military campaign in Gaza. The document accused the Israeli government of denying“essential humanitarian assistance to the civilian population”of the Palestinian enclave. London, Ottawa and Paris threatened to“take further concrete actions,”including“targeted sanctions,”should“egregious actions”on the part of Israel continue. The statement also demanded that Israel halt settlement activities in the occupied West Bank.",

    "title": "NATO to limit Ukraine discussions to avoid provoking Trump – Reuters",
    "article_text": "NATO is going to keep discussions of Ukraine“short”at its upcoming annual summit in the Netherlands in order to avoid provoking US President Donald Trump, Reuters has reported, citing the organizers of the event. The summit is scheduled to take place in The Hague on June 24 and 25. Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky, who had once been a regular guest of honor at NATO events following the escalation of the conflict between Moscow and Kiev in February 2022, has not been officially invited to attend yet. The European NATO members are“desperate to avoid upsetting a volatile Trump”during the summit, Reuters said in an article on Friday. According to the sources, the written statement summarizing the results of the event is expected to be“unusually short”in order to reduce the chance of disagreements. Whether the document“will even identify Russia as a threat or express support for Ukraine is still up in the air,”they said. Unlike the two previous years, the leaders of the bloc’s member states do not plan to hold a formal meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council as part of the summit, the officials said. According to a diplomat from the bloc, it could be replaced by a working dinner with either foreign or defense ministers. Another senior NATO diplomat told Reuters that it would be“at least a PR disaster”if Zelenskiy does not attend the summit in some form. According to the sources, the Ukrainian leader would have to settle for an invitation to a pre-summit dinner, hosted by Dutch King Willem-Alexander. This way, he could travel to The Hague without angering Trump, they explained. The US president, who is trying to broker an end to the fighting between Moscow and Kiev, had previously ruled out the possibility of Ukraine joining NATO. Russia has repeatedly stated that moves towards admitting the country into the bloc would be crossing a red line and have been one of the key reasons for the conflict, insisting that Ukraine should adopt a neutral status as a key condition for a lasting peace. The New York Times reported earlier this week that Trump, who had a public spat with Zelensky at the Oval Office in February,“reserves special animosity”for the Ukrainian leader and considers him“a bad guy.”",

    "title": "Musk proposes new political party after break with Trump",
    "article_text": "Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has proposed creating the“America Party,”marking a sharp shift in political strategy.The move comes after a public falling out with US President Donald Trump, whom Musk strongly supported during last year’s election. Musk set up and funded a pro-Trump political group, donating over $260 million, and was appointed by Trump in January to co-lead the newly established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), tasked with reducing federal bureaucracy and wasteful spending.In response to the growing political divide, Musk conducted a poll on X this week, asking his 220 million followers whether it was time to launch a new political party representing the“80% in the middle.”The poll drew more than 5.6 million responses, with around 80% expressing support. Musk declared,“The people have spoken. A new political party is needed in America,”and proposed the name“America Party.”The rift between Musk and Trump deepened after Musk condemned Trump’s $2.4 trillion tax and spending bill, calling it a“disgusting abomination.”Trump retaliated by threatening to cancel federal contracts with Musk’s companies, including SpaceX and Tesla.The conflict spilled onto social media, where Musk accused Trump of ties to the Jeffrey Epstein scandal and called for his impeachment. Epstein, a financier and convicted sex offender, was arrested in 2019 on charges of trafficking minors. He died in jail under disputed circumstances, sparking ongoing scrutiny of his connections to high-profile figures. Some Democratic lawmakers have suggested that Musk might pivot politically. Others, however, welcomed the falling out. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said,“These two huge egos were not longed for being together in this world as friends,”calling the split“long overdue.”The feud has also rippled through financial markets.Tesla shares dropped 14%, while Trump Media stock fell 8% on Thursday, recovering some of its losses the next day.Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev humorously offered to mediate a“peace deal”between Trump and Musk.“We are ready to facilitate the conclusion of a peace deal between D and E for a reasonable fee and to accept Starlink shares as payment. Don’t fight, guys,”Medvedev wrote in a post on X.",

    "title": "Musk’s father urges him to admit defeat",
    "article_text": "Errol Musk has said that his son, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, will end up losing in his conflict with US President Donald Trump, who has the overwhelming support of the American people. The clash between the two former allies over Trump’s“Big and Beautiful”tax and spending bill escalated into a series of jabs on social media on Thursday. Musk, who stepped down as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) last week, accused the president of“ingratitude,”supported the idea of impeaching him and threatened to paralyze the US space program by decommissioning the Dragon spacecraft. Trump, for his part, said that the tech billionaire had gone“crazy”and claimed that Musk was actually upset because he“took away his EV Mandate.” Errol Musk told Al Arabiya on Friday that in the conflict with his son,“Trump, of course, will prevail because he has been voted in by the majority of the people in America. I have just been three weeks in America - the people are, I would like to say, 80%, but actually 100% behind Trump.” The elder Musk said that after the rift broke out, he sent a message to Elon“telling him to make sure this fizzles out now.” “What has happened is, you know, the alphas have sort of… cleared the opposition and like most animals, elephants... lions and so forth, and humans, are now looking to take on each other. It seems a bit silly to me,”Errol Musk said. Both Trump and Elon Musk“have been through a great deal of stress… You can expect this kind of thing, you know, when you are the focus of attention day and night. Eventually, people reach a point where they lash out... I think there is a bit of tiredness here,”he said, explaining the spat. If his son is able to end the conflict swiftly, it will be just“a bump in the road”in his relationship with the president, the 79-year-old said. When asked if there is a chance that Trump and Musk will be friends again, he replied:“Yes, of course. Yes, of course.”",

    "title": "Trump deploys National Guard over LA immigration protests",
    "article_text": "World World A protester throws a stone during a standoff between police and protesters following multiple detentions by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), in the Los Angeles County city of Paramount, California, US, Jun 7, 2025.  (Photo: REUTERS/Daniel Cole) LOS ANGELES: Donald Trump ordered 2,000 National Guard troops to the streets of Los Angeles on Saturday (Jun 7) in what the White House said was an effort to quell \"lawlessness\", after sometimes-violent protests erupted overimmigration enforcement raids. The US president took federal control of California's state military to push soldiers into the country's second-biggest city, where they could face off against demonstrators. It is a rare move that Governor Gavin Newsom said was \"purposefully inflammatory\". The development came after two days of confrontations that had seen federal agents shoot flash-bang grenades and tear gas towards crowds angry at the arrests of dozens of migrants in a city with a large Latino population. Footage showed a car that had been set alight at a busy intersection, while in a video circulating on social media a man in a motorbike helmet can be seen throwing rocks at speeding federal vehicles. Protestors could be seen jeering at agents and filming them on their phones. In other scenes, demonstrators threw fireworks at lines of local law enforcement who had been called in to try to keep the peace. \"President Trump has signed a Presidential Memorandum deploying 2,000 National Guardsmen to address the lawlessness that has been allowed to fester,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said late Saturday, blaming what she called California's \"feckless\" Democratic leaders. \"The Trump Administration has a zero tolerance policy for criminal behavior and violence, especially when that violence is aimed at law enforcement officers trying to do their jobs.\" The National Guard - a reserve military - is frequently used in natural disasters, like in the aftermath of the LA fires, and rarely in instances of civil unrest. It was deployed in Los Angeles after the 2020 killing of George Floyd. Newsom, a frequent foil for Trump and a long-time foe of the Republican, took to social media to decry Saturday's White House order. \"That move is purposefully inflammatory and will only escalate tensions,\" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \"LA authorities are able to access law enforcement assistance at a moment's notice. We are in close coordination with the city and county, and there is currently no unmet need. \"This is the wrong mission and will erode public trust.\" Trump's Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth threatened to ramp up tensions further, warning that nearby regular military forces could get involved. \"If violence continues, active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton will also be mobilised - they are on high alert,\" he wrote on social media. Since taking office in January, Republican Trump has delivered on a promise to crack down hard on the entry and presence of undocumented migrants - who he has likened to \"monsters\" and \"animals\". Saturday's standoff took place in the suburb of Paramount, where demonstrators converged on a reported federal facility, which the local mayor said was being used as a staging post by agents. On Friday, masked and armed immigration agents carried out high-profile workplace raids in separate parts of Los Angeles, attracting angry crowds and setting off hours-long standoffs. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass acknowledged that some city residents were \"feeling fear\" following the federal immigration enforcement actions. \"Everyone has the right to peacefully protest, but let me be clear: violence and destruction are unacceptable, and those responsible will be held accountable,\" she said on X. FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said multiple arrests had been made following Friday's clashes. \"You bring chaos, and we'll bring handcuffs. Law and order will prevail,\" he said on X. On Saturday, amid chants for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to get out, some protestors waved Mexican flags while others set a US flag on fire, the Los Angeles Times reported. Cement blocks and overturned shopping carts served as crude roadblocks. A crowd swarmed a US Marshals Service bus exiting a nearby freeway, with authorities later closing on and off ramps to keep protesters from taking over the highway and to stop new people from flowing in. The White House has taken a hard line against the protests, with deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller calling them \"an insurrection against the laws and sovereignty of the United States\". Los Angeles, the second-most populous city in the United States, is one of the most diverse places in the country. The suburb of Paramount, home to about 50,000 people, is 82 per cent Hispanic or Latino, according to US Census data.

    "title": "Exploring Marseille, France: Where to eat, what to see, where to stay",
    "article_text": "Experiences Experiences Experiences Experiences Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions People People People People Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Experiences Experiences Marseille is a port city, constantly in motion; immigration waves from North Africa, Italy and Corsica have shaped much of its modern cultural fabric. (Photo: Jonathan Stokes/The New York Times) Marseille is like a siren’s song; for thousands of years, sailors and vagabonds have been drawn in and hooked by its rebellious undercurrent. The glimmering Mediterranean tempts beachgoers to cross sharp rocks on tiptoe, jump into the sea and laugh in swirling currents. Motorcycles tear down the coast. Marseille is a port city, constantly in motion; immigration waves from North Africa, Italy and Corsica have shaped much of its modern cultural fabric, and now young people from cities across Europe, lured by a less expensive cost of living and easy access to nature, are coming in droves. More flight routes are opening. Trendy restaurants with talented chefs at the helm are multiplying. Transportation infrastructure is expanding, cultural programs are evolving, and landmarks, such as theNotre-Dame de la Garde, will soon shed their scaffolding to reveal newly restored facades. But the city’s wild streak isn’t going anywhere. C’est Marseille, bébé — it’s Marseille, baby. Start at theFriche la Belle de Mai,a former tobacco factoryspread across roughly 500,000 sq ft. Now, it’s like a cultural centre on steroids. Art exhibitions. Theatre. Farmers’ market. Industrial buildings are patchworked with a skatepark, community garden and basketball court. The walls are drenched in street art and inside, lightbulbs hang from wires tied in knots, dangling over the heads of people ordering coffees and beers. Trains going into and out of the city’s main station rattle past its rooftop playground andrestaurant. A post shared by @ivresse.lacave Walk to the quiet Rue Leon Bourgeois toIvresse La Cave, a wine bar behind industrial glass doors. On a recent visit, the two owners — Nikolaj Tur and Max Tuckwell — danced behind the bar to Soft Cell’s Tainted Love as they popped bottles of natural wine, largely from Central and Eastern Europe. Tuckwell, who previously worked at the trendy Fulgurances in Paris, is behind the vegetable-forward small plates that change weekly, with many of the ingredients sourced from theEpicerie Paysanne de Quartier, a grocer across the street. There could be lion’s mane mushrooms in miso, or grated cucumber with soy sauce and buckwheat seeds; grazing options include Sicilian green olives and Cetara anchovies (prices range from€4 (US$4.60; S$5.90) to €18 for food, and €5 to €8 for a glass of wine). Walk-ins only. Stroll over toAtelier Renata, in a residential building where the glowing red buzzer does not lead to an apartment. At 8pm, a woman will lead you through a dark corridor into a former atelier, which has been transformed into an Italian restaurant: One seating, one room, open kitchen, no menu. Candelabras and old family photos sit atop antique shelving and a piano. It feels like being in your grandmother’s living room — if your grandma was the coolest person on Earth. Atelier Renata is run by the chefErika Blu, who named the restaurant after her own grandmother. There are starters like stracciatella soup with truffles in the winter, or tuna crudo with citrus caviar in the summer. And pasta is almost always part of the deal; it could be a white ragu with tripe that may convert even the biggest skeptic. Dinner is €60, excluding drinks. Reservations essential. Indulge in a flaky, slightly sweet chicken pastilla (€3) from theBoulangerie O’Coin Gourmand Pains Traditionnel et Gourmandisesbefore heading for a cafe creme (€2) at theBar de l’Est, a bare-bones, decades-old cafe on theMarche de Noailles. Sit facing outward toward the market, on the terrace, and it’ll become obvious why this neighbourhood is known as the “belly of Marseille.” Shoppers drag pushcarts through dozens of fruit and vegetable stalls as vendors shout prices on loop, in a rhythm. Trolleys rattle down jagged pavement, and trucks drop off produce while residents linger to chat. There are butchers, fishmongers, North African pastry shops and the local establishmentPizza Charly, which has been around since 1962 and is open from 9am, all within earshot. Une publication partagée par Jiji vous apporte une touche d'orient dans votre décoration 🧿 (@jiji_la_palme_dor) Cut across the Rue Longue-des-Capucins toward the Rue d’Aubagne, a central artery of Marseille teeming with vendors and the scent of simmering spices in the air. TheMaison Empereur, the oldest hardware store in France, has been around since 1827. Back then, the now working-class neighbourhood was bourgeois;Le Pere Blaize, the sixth-generation herbalist’s shop, hails from that era. Then stroll toJiji La Palme d’Or, which has Berber rugs, baskets and lampshades; North Africans immigrated to Marseille en masse in the 1960s. Now, theEpicerie l’Ideal, which sells things like salt-preserved lemons (€12) and rose harissa (€18), is part of the neighbourhood’s new wave of vendors, along withJoli Rouge, a thoughtfully curated antique and vintage store. Wander over toDouceur Piquante, a Comorian restaurant on a quiet, sunny street lined with trees. The chef Nadjatie Bacar smiles and hums from its open kitchen. The walls, once mint green, are now canary yellow; the restaurant changes the colour at least every season. Everything here feels thoughtful, from the fish-tailed water glasses to the bluebell flowers and colourful kale in wine bottles. The menu is short and changes frequently, sometimes with just four items scribbled on a chalkboard. There could be madaba, a Comorian stew made with beef, cassava leaves and coconut milk, or whole-grilled fish with seasonal vegetables (prices vary, but tend to range between €11 and €16). Reservations recommended. Walk along the Quai de Rive Neuve past thousands of sailboat masts, and Fort St.-Nicolas, one of thetwo fortressesthat mirror each other across the harbour, will appear. Louis XIV ordered its construction in the 17th century, not just to defend against seaborne invasions, but with cannons pointed inward, toward Marseille, as a warning to any residents considering a revolt. Since then, it had almost always been closed to the public — until spring 2024. Now, on some nights, the fort — also known as the Citadelle de Marseille — effectively transforms into a nightclub with techno music against the backdrop of old walls glowing pink; itssummer programmeincludes sculpture workshops, concerts and escape games for kids (€10 euros, €15 for adults). Picnics on the grounds are encouraged year-round, or stop for a glass of homemade lemonade (€4) or wine (€4.50) atLa Guinguette du Fort, its outdoor snack bar with panoramic views of the port. Free entry to the complex, with prices varying by activity. Climb the near-vertical hill or take the bus (€1.70) to theNotre-Dame de la Garde, the basilica topped with its golden Madonna holding a baby Jesus in her arms. Its wraparound terrace opens onto the Mediterranean and a collage of Provençal rooftops, framed by villas carved into surrounding hillsides. From here, the Fort St Nicolas looks like a sandcastle. Inside, the ceiling is illuminated in an intricate mosaic; and, in the altar area, a mosaic depicts a sailboat crashing into waves. Throughout the church, boats hang from strings overhead, dangling over pews; nautical paintings and tattered rescue buoys are mounted on the walls. These were offerings from sailors looking for protection against rough seas. Much of the structure is currently being restored; it’s set to shed its scaffolding by theend of the year. Free entry. A post shared by Pizzeria La Bonne Mère (@pizzerialabonnemere) Time spent in Marseille without eating pizza would be sacrilege. It’s the unofficial food of the city, and it’s everywhere — sidewalk stalls, restaurants and a unionised network of trucks. Stroll about 10 minutes down the hill toPizzeria La Bonne Mere. The owners’ great-great grandparents were part of the wave of Italian immigrants that brought pizza to the city in the early 20th century; now, the pies are a combination of the Neapolitan, Roman and Marseillais styles. The anchovy pie (€14 ), a local specialty, is the real star. Marinated anchovies are draped across a generous dose of bright, garlicky tomato sauce. Homemade pesto ground with a mortar and pestle is drizzled on top with Taggiasca olives. Reservations recommended. Take a cab to theCours Julien, the North Star of Marseille nightlife. Bass ricochets off buildings as crowds move through a maze of punk clubs, bars and restaurants where delicate flowers are used as garnish.Planete Livre Marseille la Passerelleis a loud, unpretentious bar with an extensive wine selection (€3 per glass). AtLabo’n Heure, a cocktail bar with backlit bottles of Cihuatan rum and kelp-infused gin, the server greets patrons as “mes amies” (cocktails between €7 and €16). But all roads eventually lead toLe Champ de Mars, a Marseille institution that has been around for more than 100 years. Don’t expect fine wines here — this is a place to let loose. Take a shot of tequila (€2.50), dance and play foosball under warm, colourful light. Pick up a cappuccino (€3.80) and homemade pastries fromBoujou Coffee, a modern, airy coffeeshop in the seaside Endoume neighbourhood, and head around the corner down the Traverse de la Cascade. Hang the last left and take the stairs down to the rocks. Then, curve around the bend opening onto theAnse de la Fausse Monnaie, the cove under a viaduct dipping into clear turquoise water, and find a spot to laze. This is a place of mystery; its name translates into Counterfeit Money Cove, with competing rumours surrounding its origins. One legend says workers found fake coins during excavations on the site; others hold whispers of kings, assassinations and shady land ownership. Now, drama comes in the form of scenery; swimmers emerge from the sea like mermaids to sun on the rocks while seagulls look like paper airplanes being carried through the sky. Walk roughly 15 minutes northwest along the coast toward the Vallon des Auffes, the port marked by a rusty archway bearing its name over a staircase. It will give way to a rainbow of cabanas scattered throughout the hillside, and boats floating under a vaulted bridge. Fishermen sit on the harbour on stools, trimming ropes with knives; nets are draped over crates like tulle veils spilling onto the ground. This is against the backdrop ofChez Fonfon, the 73-year-old restaurant with glass windows overlooking the harbor. The bouillabaisse here is not so much a meal as a procession of broth, toast, sauces and fish (€65 per person). The garlicky rouille is strong enough to knock you out and piles of fish glisten, tinted amber from saffron threads. Reservations recommended. Lily Radziemski © The New York Times.

    "title": "Hooked on wearables: Is all of this self-monitoring making us paranoid?",
    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Women Women Women People Wellness Wellness Wellness Wellness Singapore Buyers' Guide Living Buyers' Guide Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Obsessions Dining Dining Dining Dining Travel Experiences Travel Experiences Wellness Wellness As wearable technology, like the Oura Ring, becomes more ubiquitous, some users say having so much data about their bodies is making them more anxious. (Photo: iStock/AsiaVision) Sarah Hills was worried about her heart. Her Oura Ring, a wearable device that tracks users’ biometric data, including body temperature, heart rate and blood oxygen levels, was telling her something might be off. The ring provides some of its data in the form of scores, like a “readiness” score that uses “sleep quality, body signals, and activity levels to show how prepared you are to take on the day,” according to Oura. Since receiving the ring as a Christmas gift, Hills had begun to compulsively check her stats. If her scores weren’t good, the 22-year-old said, she would ruminate. When her stats wobbled this year, she tried to see a doctor. When she couldn’t get an appointment soon enough, Hills, a recent graduate of Providence College in Rhode Island, and a friend drove to a pharmacy where she spent US$50 (S$64.41) on an at-home blood pressure cuff and monitor to put her mind at ease. “At that point I was, like, ‘Oh my gosh, this thing is literally destroying my mind,’” she said. Eventually, Hills was able to see a doctor who told her she was healthy. The doctor did have one recommendation: Consider ditching the ring. In the eternal human quest to know thyself, it’s tempting to seize on every bit of information we can glean. If you could know, for instance, not just that you slept 6.5 hours last night but also that 12 per cent of those hours were spent in REM sleep and that your overall “sleep efficiency”–time asleep versus time awake–was 85 per cent, as many pieces of wearable tech can tell you, why wouldn’t you? At least that’s the attitude of many people in our age of the quantified self, in which collecting sheaves of data about our bodies every day seems to hold the promise of bringing about a happier, healthier life. But what if all of that data is also heightening our stress? Is there a metric for that? While some Oura users say they enjoy the ring as a screen-free way to keep tabs on their bodies, several Oura owners, including Hills, described feeling increasingly anxious after using their devices. Rather than helping them feel more in control of their wellness, the data only made them fixate on potential–and often nonexistent–problems. You could call it Oura paranoia, though the phenomenon is hardly exclusive to any one product: As wearable health technology, including Apple Watches and Fitbits, have become more popular in recent years, some users have struggled with the unintended psychological side effects of the devices. Hannah Muehl, a physician assistant and dietitian in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, said she found that the quantified knowledge that she wasn’t sleeping well made it even harder for her to get rest. She purchased her ring after having a baby to track her sleepless nights nursing. “It puts action behind things that should be innate, like reminding you to rest, reminding you sleep, all these things that shouldn’t be innate practices,” Muehl said. “Making them things that you’re trying to hit as a goal–which inherently, if you’re working hard toward resting, you’re not actually resting.\" “I just felt like I couldn’t do anything right to make the ring happy,” said Abi Caswell, a bakery owner who lives in New Orleans. She got her ring a little over a year ago to use the device’s temperature-tracking feature for family planning. She liked the idea of not having “to remember to take out a thermometer every morning,” Caswell, 29, said. She described become disenchanted with the device while opening her second bakery location. It was an intense period for Caswell, and the ring’s regular reminders reinforced what she already knew: “My body was in maximum overdrive,” she said. Seeing that spelled out in data only exacerbated her negative feelings, like giving an upset person the wildly unhelpful advice that he or she should justcalm down. “It was stressing me out more thinking about how stressed I was,” Caswell said, “and how I was not able to give my body and my health the attention that it needed.” The proliferation of technology designed to track our biology can also make it easy to forget that human beings are pretty well equipped to do that on our own, said Jacqueline D Wernimont, an associate professor at Dartmouth College in the film and media studies department who specialises in histories of quantification. Wearable technology “takes the authority and knowledge out of the individual and places it in some third party, in a device that then the individual has to consult in order to try to decipher or understand her own body,” said Wernimont, who is the author of Numbered Lives: Life And Death In Quantum Media. “That in and of itself produces a kind of anxiety,”she added. Shyamal Patel, Oura’s senior vice president of science, acknowledged that sometimes having access to so much data can be stressful for some users, including himself. Occasionally, he said, he take breaks from wearing his ring if he is feeling overwhelmed. “I think it’s on us as individuals and users and how we actually leverage this technology so the technology is serving us not the other way around,” Patel said. He also stressed that users should take care not to compare their biometric data with others’. Some have found that difficult, particularly as social media has amplified stories of people who they say their wearable tech tipped them off to serious medical conditions. “I knew that I had cancer before I was diagnosed because of my Oura Ring,” Nikki Gooding, a 27-year-old nurse practitioner in Richmond, Virginia, said in a widely shared TikTok in March. Hunter Woodhall, a Paralympic track star, said his Oura Ring “may have saved my life” after it helped him seek treatment for appendicitis. Gooding, who was later diagnosed with lymphoma, explained how the ring’s daily updates alerted her to “major signs of some sort of physical stress.” Her temperature was consistently higher than usual, she said in an interview. “Please don’t let this scare you!!,” Gooding later wrote in a comment on her video, acknowledging a number of people who said Gooding’s story was the reason they could never wear an Oura Ring. “I deal with a lot of patients who do have health anxiety, so I understood,” Gooding said. These days, Muehl said, she has taken off her ring for good. She’s back to using an old-school pedometer to track her steps. Caswell is still wearing hers. She said she checks it only twice a day. Hills abandoned the blood pressure monitor at her parents’ house. She still sleeps in her ring a few nights a week. Wernimont said she regularly has classroom discussions with students who are overly reliant on their quantified experience, focusing closely on data and trusting those metrics over their own firsthand experiences and physical sensations. “They’re like, ‘The device said ...’ or ‘The monitor said ...,’ and I’m like, ‘But what did yourbodysay?’” By Madison Malone Kircher © The New York Times Company The article originally appeared inThe New York Times.

    "title": "Why are some Chinese youth calling themselves ‘rat people’, and what issues does it surface?",
    "article_text": "East Asia East Asia Known as “lao shu ren” in Chinese, the youth-associated phenomenon describes those with lifestyles like a rat - nocturnal, low-key, and surviving in the margins with no set path. The term “rat person” has struck a chord among Chinese youths, describing a lifestyle like that of a rat - nocturnal, low-key, and surviving in the margins with no set path. (File photo: iStock/marchmeena29) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Imagine this - you wake up past 11am. Instead of getting out of bed to wash up, you stay under the sheets for the next couple of hours, scrolling through social media, shopping apps or Netflix. Only at 3pm do you muster up the energy to make your first meal of the day. But after that, the cycle between food, bed and phone repeats till you fall asleep, usually past midnight. This is the life of a rat person or \"lao shu ren\" in Chinese, a viral term coined by Chinese youths on social media. As the name suggests, it describes a lifestyle like that of a rat - nocturnal, low-key, and surviving in the margins with no set path. Viewed as a form of silent rebellion against hustle culture and the fast pace of modern society, it has struck a chord among Chinese youths. Beyond those in the country, many living abroad in places like the United Kingdom and Singapore have also adopted the phrase to describe themselves.

While largely seen as a lighthearted trend, it has also laid bare the serious pressures young Chinese face at school and work - from stringent academic demands to a hyper-competitive job market. The above routine is a day in the life of Pu Yiqin, 23, a Chinese master’s student at King’s College London and self-professed “rat person”. She documents her reclusive routine through daily “humorous” vlogs shared on the Chinese lifestyle app Xiaohongshu. In one video, she hits the hay only past 1.30am. “Going to bed early tonight, good night,” she quips. Also, her bedroom curtains are perpetually drawn. “The lights are too bright, rats need a dim environment (to survive),” she remarks. There are no official statistics on whether more “rat people” are emerging. But there have been indications of its resonance among young Chinese. In late February, an online post by a young woman from Zhejiang province sharing her reclusive routine racked up more than 400,000 likes. A search by CNA on Xiaohongshu and short-video platform Douyin found numerous posts of Chinese youths - at home and abroad - documenting their “rat person” routines. Pu is among them. “I can’t speak for everyone, but I’m definitely a part of this phenomenon,” she told CNA, adding that she believes a lot of Chinese international students can relate to being “rat people” in some way. \"Outside of classes or the occasional trip, most of our time is spent holed up at home … like mice living in the dark,” she said. The trend is mostly associated with younger Chinese, particularly Gen Zs and millennials. Gen Zs refer to those born between 1997 and 2012, while millennials are those born between 1981 and 1996. The “rat person” trend is not novel. Parallels can be drawnwith the hikikomori in Japan- people who have effectively retreated from society for extended periods, typically more than six months. In China, hikikomori are known as “jian ju zu”, which translates to “cocoon tribe”. A 2023 report by local news site The Paper found an estimated 900,000 members across two jian ju zu groups on the online discussion platform Baidu Tieba. The “rat person” identity is linked to the varying pressures facing different generations of Chinese youths, said Senior Associate Professor Kuang Xianwen from Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU) in Suzhou. The current generation of youths, unlike those in the 1980s, feels like reaping the rewards of hard work remains elusive despite their efforts, he told CNA. “(They) enter society, (they) work, and there's still a lot of pressure … everyone's striving so hard and some of them feel there's no hope, because competition is fierce  - so what's the point?” China’s youth unemployment rate hit 15.8 per cent in April, according to official data. While the rate, which excludes students, is the lowest the country has recorded so far this year, it remains higher than the 14.7 per cent during the same period last year. At the same time, a record 12.22 million university graduates are expected this year, up from about 9 million in 2021. The Chinese government has acknowledged the urgency toaddress structural challenges facing the job market. “The mismatch between the supply and demand of human resources has become more pronounced,” said China’s Minister of Human Resources and Social Security Wang Xiaoping in March. Intense competition extends into the academic realm as well. Arguably the best example is the national college entrance examination, known as gaokao. Widely seen as a gatekeeper of opportunity, recent efforts to ease the pressure-cooker environment for studentshave run up against obstacles. As a result, some opt to reject this perceived rat race - slacking off and doing just enough to get by, in a trend known as lying flat or “tang ping” in Chinese. The “rat person” trend has been seen as an evolution of tang ping. Yuan Yuan, a lecturer at XJTLU, told CNA it refers to young people deciding to “quit social competition altogether”. “It's a form of giving up on climbing (the) social ladder, I'll put my energy into (my activities) at night, on the internet, and my role in society is simply existing like a machine,” she said. “As an adult, there's a grey area where you know there are things at work that you have to do, and you may not agree with … you won't say ‘I quit’ because you can accept that it's part of work,” she added. “However, rat people may be avoiding that grey area.” A popular comment on the vlog of the woman from Zhejiang province sums up the mindset of those who take up the “rat people” banner. “We are tired of the polished, fast-paced, hyper-efficient lifestyle forced on us. We just want the freedom to lie down whenever and wherever we want.” At the same time, analysts see the growing youth embrace of the “rat person” trend as a form of self-mockery, to find humour in adversity and commiserate with counterparts. This is, after all, a generation that has taken up unconventional hobbies like raising mango seeds, rocks and even toothpaste blobs as “pets”, in a trend experts have said reflects rising loneliness and urban pressure among Chinese youth. “If you look at rat people as a form of self-mockery, this is something that the youths are very good at,” said Yuan, the lecturer at XJTLU. “There's a term, zi hei, where you display your most vulnerable side but in a way that doesn't let people feel anxious or worried,” she said. Literally translated to “self-blacken” in English, zi hei means self-mockery or self-deprecating humour in the Chinese context. “(The term) rat people is also a way of social interaction.” Pu, the Chinese international student, shares similar sentiments. “Maybe it’s also the massive pressure that young people face; they enjoy this sort of self-mockery, humorous type of comparison,” she said. And even if one decides to be a “rat person”, don’t write off their resilience, Pu said, describing how the term carries the image of someone “crawling in the dark but also still trying hard”. “Many people may be existing in an environment that’s unfavourable, but they will still do their best to finish whatever needs to be done.” Subscribe to our Chief Editor’s Week in Review Our chief editor shares analysis and picks of the week's biggest news every Saturday.

    "title": "Commentary: TikTok isn't the reason we watch ‘slop’ – burnout is",
    "article_text": "Commentary Commentary Social media is often blamed for the lowbrow content and products many people enjoy. But it's not the real culprit, says Erin Lowry for Bloomberg Opinion. NEW YORK:Social mediais often the scapegoat for just about everything wrong in modern society. The latest thing it’s getting blamed for is “slop”. Originally, the term refers to the pervasiveness of low-quality AI-generated content that is flooding social feeds, but it has turned into a catch-all for much oftoday’s subpar products and content. Laying all of this at the feet of social platforms is a mistake, though. Slop is not a new phenomenon. Each generation can point to moments in which the old guard decried that the latest media or gadget was brain-rotting sludge. In my lifetime, it’s been everything from hip-hop and grunge music to the rise of reality television to violent video games, such as Call of Duty or Grand Theft Auto, to the Blackberry–which was so addictive it was nicknamed Crackberry. We should remember that when we read of society’s incessant appetite for lowbrow content today. Now, has our consumption of it become more voracious because of online access? Yes. We can mindlessly scroll through our feeds, stream questionable podcasts and add fast fashion and services to our virtual carts with ease. But the culprit is not necessarily the likes of TikTok, Instagram or YouTube. It’s burnout, but we’ve become so accepting of brushing excessive exhaustion off as a necessary evil for achieving success that it doesn’t get enough blame. A majority of millennials, 66 per cent, according to a report from Aflac, claim to feel moderate to high levels of the occupational phenomenon. Six years ago, a Gallup study found only 28 per cent of millennials reported feeling frequent or constant burnout at work. This feeling of mental overload is commonly positioned as a consequence of unmanaged workplace stress. Being overworked is hardly new. In fact, the Maslach Burnout Inventory, a standardised and quantitative way to measure the sensation, was developed in the early 1980s. Nearly four decades later, the World Health Organization categorised it as a syndrome that results in “feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion, increased mental distance from one’s job”, which could include cynicism, “and reduced professional efficacy”. But this definition doesn’t quite encapsulate the full scope of why people end their days exhausted and turning to slop for comfort. The suffocating pressure of modern life beyond work breeds anxiety and tension for which we need a salve. That salve often comes in the form of the same device that induces so much angst. Millennials were indoctrinated from early adulthood to be fully accessible all the time. When it wasn’t work messages lighting up phones, it was family, friends, news alerts, push notifications from apps or even spam. This constant, attention-grabbing communication is a drain on energy and brain power–and that’s before you add in caring for children, parents or pets. (We millennials do love our pets.) Once the reviled new kids on the block tagged the “Me Generation”, the 30-to-mid-40-somethings have ascended into the position of the “sandwich generation”. Our predecessors to this squeeze, Gen Xers, are already familiar with the exhausting and mind-numbing pressure of caring for ageing parents while raising children. And that’s before attempting to care for themselves physically, mentally and financially. It’s probably why they’re the second most burned-out cohort, with 55 per cent reporting experiencing moderate to high levels of the syndrome, according to the Aflac report. And yet, when life feels overwhelming or people just want to take the edge off at the end of the day, pouring a large glass of wine is no longer the go-to remedy. Several studies and surveys have shown that younger adults are drinking less compared to older generations. Turning on a TV show–especially one that’s bingeable–or lying down and scrolling through a seemingly endless supply of videos on TikTok or Instagram has taken the place of drinking alcohol. It’s a behaviour so pervasive that the term “bed rotting” became a trend on TikTok. It means lounging in bed to rejuvenate as a form of self-care. Once again, what’s old becomes new, but the bed rotting of yore didn’t mean being plugged into a device that served an endless stream of short videos and memes. It probably meant reading a book or sleeping. Against the crushing pressure of a never-ending to-do list, slop seems to calm the overworked brain and nervous system because it provides a stimulating and quick distraction. To be clear, this is not in defence of what we’ve been consuming because the algorithm is designed to adapt to individual interests, including fears and insecurities that can leave people feeling more anxious. But I don’t believe the antidote to both burnout and slop consumption is to eschew all forms of digital connectedness and “go touch grass”. (Although being in nature is a proven remedy to stress.) The burnout to slop pipeline can only be stymied by an examination of American society, priorities and the social systems that support–or fail–our citizens. There need to be top-down changes that include social safety nets for ageing Americans, which takes the pressure off their adult children. There should also be affordable childcare that allows working parents to ensure their kids are well attended to without sacrificing other important financial goals, like retirement contributions. New parents shouldn’t be expected to navigate the recovery of postpartum by quickly returning to work. Instead, they should be guaranteed paid parental leave for a minimum of six, but preferably for at least 12 weeks. Major pipedream policy changes aside, the average citizen can make adjustments on a personal level. That could look like stopping the overscheduling of your children, prioritising a hard stop from work once a week or even taking a 15-minute social media-free walk. However you decide to slow down your slop intake, addressing your burnout has to be on the menu too.

    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Women Women Women People Wellness Wellness Wellness Wellness Singapore Buyers' Guide Living Buyers' Guide Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Obsessions Dining Dining Dining Dining Travel Experiences Travel Experiences Wellness Wellness Cultivating self-compassion can actually help you cope better with life’s struggles. (Photo: iStock/Edwin Tan) If a friend is struggling with a big challenge or feels defeated, it’s usually our first instinct to offer words of comfort and understanding. But often it’s not so easy to do this for ourselves. We can be our own harshest critics. Practicing a little self-compassion, though, goes a long way.Research showsthat when people go through challenges or stressful situations, those who display more self-compassion are more resilient. “We can say, ‘I made a mistake,’ as opposed to saying, ‘I am a mistake,’” said Kristin Neff, an associate professor of educational psychology at the University of Texas at Austin who has studied self-compassion for more than two decades. “It’s a healthier alternative to self-esteem, because it’s not about judging yourself positively, it’s just about being helpful and kind to yourself.” Self-compassion is the process of expressing support, warmth and understanding toward yourself during difficult times–and recognising that you aren’t alone in your imperfections. It arises from mindfulness, which involves staying focused on the present moment without judgment. Self-compassionate people can identify when they are feeling defeated or inadequate, but avoid becoming lost in those feelings so that they can respond to themselves with kindness instead of ruminating, Dr Neff said. Being kind to yourself doesn’t mean hosting a pity party. Our suffering is not unique–flaws and failures are part of what make us human. And while we all suffer in different ways, the knowledge that suffering is universal can help prevent feelings of shame or isolation. One common myth is that self-compassion will undermine motivation to improve yourself or your circumstances. But research suggests that support, encouragement and constructive criticism aremore effective motivatorsthan negative feedback, Dr Neff added. Another myth is that self-compassion is self-indulgent. But in reality, Dr Neff said, it has been shown toreduce burnoutand therefore allow us to better care for others. Self-indulgence, on the other hand, involves behaving in a way that is ultimately harmful–either to yourself or to others. Finally, self-compassion is sometimes confused with self-care, but it’s not just about soothing, said Steven C Hayes, a clinical psychologist and the creator of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, which emphasises the types of skills that are useful for building self-compassion, like living in the moment and focusing on values rather than imposed expectations. Self-compassion “is the empowerment to be yourself, to feel what you’re feeling, fully and without needless defense,” he said. There area number of waysto practise self-compassion: 1. SAY KIND THINGS TO YOURSELF EVERY DAY Think about how you show up for yourself throughout your day, Dr Neff said. Are you supportive and encouraging? Or are you your own worst enemy? “The vast majority of people are significantly more compassionate to others than they are to themselves,” Dr Neff said. If you’re prone to beating yourself up, she added, then tryspeaking to yourself kindly, just like you would to a good friend in the same situation. 2. TAKE A COMPASSION BREAK Tara Brach, a psychologist and the author of Radical Acceptance, suggests the RAIN method: Recognise, allow, investigate and nurture. The idea here is to recognise the emotions you’re having and then allow those feelings to exist without reflexively pushing them away. Next, investigate how your body is affected by your emotions–is there a hollowness in your stomach or a clenching in your chest? Take time to also explore the beliefs associated with those emotions–are you assuming that something is wrong with you? “That is probably the biggest suffering that people have: ‘I’m unlovable, I’m falling short, I should be doing more,’” Dr Brach said. Then, nurture. What does the suffering part of you most need right now? Understanding? To be forgiven? A kind message? Put a hand over your heart or use another soothing touch that feels caring. Send a kind message inward: “It’s okay to feel this” or “You’re doing the best that you can.” These tiny gestures can make a big difference. One small studyof 135 undergraduates found that those who regularly spent 20 seconds a day placing their hands over their heart and belly while thinking kind thoughts like “How can I be a friend to myself in this moment?” reported feeling less stressed and were found to have more compassion for themselves after a month. 3. PAY IT FORWARD By giving yourself compassion, you become better able to receive and offer compassionate care to others, Dr Hayes said. “Show them that they’re not alone,” he added. “We need people who are more self-compassionateandcompassionate toward others.” Self-compassion might involve establishing healthy boundaries in a relationship or even turning your compassion outward–for example, volunteering for an important cause or attending a protest to try to bring about positive political or social change. In this sense, self-compassion can be fierce and strong: Think “mama bear” energy. “Part of caring for ourselves means trying to end harm on the societal level as well,” Dr Neff said. “It’s bigger than just our individual selves.” By Christina Caron © The New York Times Company The article originally appeared inThe New York Times.

    "title": "From soju rituals to hangover soups: What I found out about South Korea’s complicated drinking culture",
    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Women Women Women People Wellness Wellness Wellness Wellness Singapore Buyers' Guide Living Buyers' Guide Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Obsessions Dining Dining Dining Dining Travel Experiences Travel Experiences Travel Travel Through awkward solo shots, hangover soups, and booze-friendly bites, this writer discovers the quirky charm of Korean drinking traditions. People in Seoul drinking at night. (Photo: iStock/VTT Studio) This audio is generated by an AI tool. I gestured to the server some distance away, holding up my index finger before pointing to the empty green bottle on my table. I could have practised what little Korean I knew, just sufficient to string together my request, “Jeogiyo, soju hana juseyo.” (Excuse me, one soju please.) but failed to summon up enough liquid courage in the end. The irony of escaping subzero temperatures – so cold it drained my phone’s battery in minutes – to seek refuge in a cozy tented street food stall only to order ice-cold soju didn’t escape me. It’s a dream come true, perpetuated by K-drama where the orange-tented pojangmacha usually sets the scene for developing romance between the male and female lead or colleagues drowning out woes after work. Located betweenexits 6and 5 of Jongno 3-ga Station, Jongno 3-ga Pojangmacha Street comes alive every evening till late. Further away, I stumbled upon some more on the street whereCaffe Pascucciis at. Irene Yoo, chef and co-owner of Orion Bar in Brooklyn, New York City, said: “The Jongno neighborhood is a little touristy but very alluring for its crowded collection of pojangmacha.” The streetside drinking experience wasn’t as affordable as one might think. Soju was cheap but I found anju (food consumed with alcohol) a little pricey – for one or two persons – so I didn’t order frivolously. I drank alone, surrounded by strangers, already committing a faux pas in a country that takes pride in drinking together. Alcohol is deeply ingrained in Korean social life from Buddhist ceremonies and holidays to homebrewing culture and Confucian ancestral rituals. As early as in the Goryeo Dynasty (918-1392), many dishes were created to be paired with alcohol. My first meal in Seoul was atSamhaejipin Jongno 3-ga’s Bossam Alley. It would have been a perfect spot to imbibe if not for the fact that we were there at noon. Top your bossam (boiled pork wraps) with oysters for a briny hit before slurping the piping hot gamjatang (pork spine stew) which comes free with every order. We knew we were at the right place seeing the boisterous group of elderly diners next table. Today, anju is more than just bar food – it’s an essential part of Korean drinking culture. Jokbal (braised pig’s trotters) is usually enjoyed with soju and on rainy days, Koreans crave jeon and makgeolli. So common it is to have fried chicken and beer together, there is even a portmanteau for it – chimaek, made up of “chikin” (chicken) and “maekju” (beer). AtMajanggol, a butcher restaurant in Majang Meat Market, in between sips of soju and mouthfuls of perfectly-grilled chunks of hanwoo, we witnessed employees politely time their escape when their bosses got up to leave. Zhang Anqi, who has been living in Seoul for more than two years, observed: “I have hoesik at least once every two weeks as I work in a fairly traditional Korean company. It’s definitely less frequent compared to pre-pandemic times and hoesik are usually not organised on Fridays to promote work-life balance.” Hoesik is a unique aspect of Korean drinking culture – drawn-out after-work boozy dinners to foster team bonding and camaraderie. Pandemic restrictions accelerated the ongoing shift away from hoesik culture following Seoul High Court’s landmark 2007 ruling which made forcing subordinates to drink alcohol illegal and the 2017 #MeToo movement where women protested more openly against workplace sexual harassment. “People still feel some pressure to attend though. If your boss enjoys hoesik, it can be hard to say no,” Zhang added. Post-pandemic, Koreans do not succumb as much to the pressures of attending hoesik. Younger generations who do not like binge-drinking or hanging out with colleagues after office hours are more vocal in expressing their views and some companies are starting to take note. Denise Tan, a Singaporean global coordinator based in Seoul, hasn’t attended a hoesik since joining her company one year ago. “From what I heard, the attendance was so poor and the atmosphere so awkward that the bosses gave up hosting them.” Traditionally distilled from rice at 35 per cent alcohol by volume (ABV), soju is probably the most well-known sool (Korean traditional liquor). In 1965, facing postwar rice shortage, producers were banned from using local rice to make alcoholic drinks. The soju in green bottles we are familiar with was born against that backdrop – made from cheap starches like sweet potatoes and tapioca, then distilled to over 95 per cent ABV before diluting to 30 per cent ABV and mixed with artificial sweeteners to make it more palatable. Diluted soju became widely popular because it was cheap, allowing for people of all social classes to clink glasses, talk more casually, and bond. During the economic boom of the 70s and 80s, Koreans wanted drinking to be efficient too – it was faster to get drunk on soju. Domestic sales of diluted soju hit 3.7 trillion won (S$3.5 billion) in 2020, ranking as the top alcoholic beverage with a 42.1 per cent market share followed by beer at 39.7 percent. Last year, soju exports exceeded US$200 million for the first time, on the back of an unfaltering K-wave and growing demand for low-alcohol beverages. Hitejinro first introduced Chamisul soju in 1998 with 23 per cent ABV, then launched a lower-proof version called Chamisul Fresh in 2006. Chamisul Fresh’s alcohol content was further reduced to 16 per cent last year. Likewise, Lotte Chilsung Beverage also lowered the ABV of its flagship soju Chum-Churum from 20 per cent in 2006 to 16.5 per cent in 2021. Increasingly-popular fruit-flavoured soju is even milder – at about 13 per cent ABV. In recent years, the widespread popularity of green-bottled soju has given rise to an interest in artisanally-made ones, closer to how soju should be – undiluted and tasting more like whisky. At the same time, with rising inflation and high interest rates, many Koreans are also opting to spend more thoughtfully and drink at home, either alone or with friends, sometimes indulging in premium alcohol. Yeonghwi Yun, co-owner and manager of Bar Cham, said: “Like us, many bars are now making cocktails with various Korean spirits, including soju. Premium distilled sojus like Hwayo, Won Soju, and Tokki Soju are also becoming widely known around the world, changing perceptions of soju.” Bar Chamis known for its innovative cocktails that honour Korean heritage. I took a risk – turning up at opening time as bookings were notoriously hard to score. It worked. I had my first “gimbap” there, a delicious concoction crafted with Tokki Soju and complemented by fragrant sesame oil and cucumber. For those interested to learn about traditional Korean liquors, a good place to start would be atThe Sool Gallery, a government-run tasting room offering free tasting sessions in English. Email them if you do not have a real name-verified Naver account to make a reservation. There is a small exhibition and you can buy sool to take home too. An unmissable part of Korean drinking culture is haejangguk, or hangover soup, not unlike Singapore’s post-revelry supper of bak kut teh or pig’s organ soup. A comforting bowl of broth that’s easy on the stomach to rehydrate and cure a hangover? This is something I can definitely get behind. Whether you prefer kongnamulguk (soybean sprout soup) or hwangtaeguk (dried pollack soup), there’s a haejangguk for everyone. Instant noodles work just as well to combat that dreadful hunger-nausea. Founded in 1937 during the Japanese occupation, Seoul’s sixth oldest restaurantCheongjinokspecialises in Seoul-style haejangguk, with cow blood curd – a big draw for me – and soy bean paste. Despite the mixed reviews in recent years, I found it satisfying – and my children asked for seconds. I asked Yun if he had a go-to haejangguk eatery. “It's a gamjatang place in Jongno district. I've been working in this area for more than 10 years now andGwanghwamun Ttukgamis still my all-time favourite.” For those who would rather not slurp their hangovers away, anti-hangover products offer a straightforward alternative. From bottled drinks to gummies and gelatin sticks, hangover cures are typically enriched with vitamins, electrolytes, and Korean herbs, all promising to curb the effects of over-drinking. Fueled by widespread alcohol consumption, South Korea’s hangover cure market was valued at 347.3 billion won (S$323 million) in 2023, up from 224.3 billion won in 2021 – significant enough to prompt government regulation. Starting January this year, manufacturers will need to conduct clinical trials to back up their product claims. I’ve learnt the hard way that the most challenging part of hitting up a pojangmacha isn’t figuring out when to stop ordering more soju but making it through the morning after. At the first convenience store I came upon, serendipitously playing Le Sserafim’s Unforgiven on repeat, I desperately asked the cashier for hangover remedy recommendations. The pills didn’t have much effect on my throbbing headache and nausea. Eventually, I found relief in cup noodles. I should have known better.

    "title": "Gaza rescuers say Israeli fire kills 36, six near aid centre",
    "article_text": "World World Palestinians spray water at the site of an Israeli strike on a house, in Gaza City, Jun 7, 2025. (Photo: REUTERS/Ebrahim Hajjaj) GAZA: Gaza's civil defence agency said Saturday (Jun 7) that Israeli forces had killed at least 36 Palestinians, six of them in a shooting near a US-backed aid distribution centre. The Israeli military told AFP that troops had fired \"warning shots\" at individuals it said were \"advancing in a way that endangered the troops\". The shooting deaths were the latest reported near the aid centre run by theGaza Humanitarian Fund (GHF)in the southern district of Rafah, and came after itresumed distributions following a brief suspensionin the wake of similar deaths earlier this week. Meanwhile,an aid boat with 12 activists on board, including Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg, was nearing Gaza in a bid to highlight the plight of Palestinians in the face of an Israeli blockade that has only been partially eased. Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP that at around 7:00 am (0400 GMT), \"six people were killed and several others wounded by the forces of the Israeli occupation near the Al-Alam roundabout\", where they had gathered to seek humanitarian aid from the distribution centre around a kilometre away. AFP is unable to independently verify the tolls compiled by the civil defence agency or the circumstances of the deaths it reports. Samir Abu Hadid, who was there early Saturday, told AFP that thousands of people had gathered near the roundabout. \"As soon as some people tried to advance towards the aid centre, the Israeli occupation forces opened fire from armoured vehicles stationed near the centre, firing into the air and then at civilians,\" Abu Hadid said. The GHF said in a statement it had not distributed aid on Saturday because of \"direct threats\" from Hamas. Later Saturday, the Israeli army said an operation in Gaza City resulted in the killing of Asaad Abu Sharia, reportedly head of the Mujahideen Brigades. The armed group is close to Hamas ally Islamic Jihad that Israel has also accused over deaths of hostages seized from Kibbutz Nir Oz near the border. The army said he had taken part in the bloody attack on Nir Oz when Hamas launched its October 7, 2023 attack on Israel. It said he was \"directly implicated\" in the killings of Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas, a family who became a symbol of seized hostages for many in Israel. The GHF, officially a private effort with opaque funding, began operations in late May as Israel partially eased a more than two-month-long aid blockade. UN agencies and major aid groups have declined to work with it, citing concerns it serves Israeli military goals. On Saturday, the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said that the overall toll for the Gaza war had reached 54,772, the majority civilians. The UN considers these figures reliable. The war was sparked by Hamas's October 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people on the Israeli side, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official figures. Israel has come under increasing international criticism over the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, where the UN warned in May that the entire population was at risk of famine. The aid boat Madleen, organised by an international activist coalition, was sailing towards Gaza on Saturday, aiming to breach Israel's naval blockade and deliver aid to the territory, organisers said. \"We are now sailing off the Egyptian coast,\" German human rights activist Yasemin Acar told AFP, saying they expected to reach Gaza by Monday. The Palestinian territory was under Israeli naval blockade even before Hamas's October 2023 attack and the Israeli military has made clear it intends to enforce it. A 2010 commando raid on the Turkish ship Mavi Marmara, which was part of a similar attempt to breach Israel's naval blockade, left 10 civilians dead. The Israeli military has stepped up its operations in Gaza in recent weeks in what it says is a renewed push to defeat Hamas, whose October 2023 attack sparked the war. On Saturday, the military issued evacuation orders for neighbourhoods in northern Gaza, saying they had been used for rocket attacks. Also on Saturday, Hamas released a photograph of one of the remaining hostages, Matan Zangauker, appearing to be in poor health, with a warning that he would not survive. His mother, Einav Zangauker, speaking at a protest in Tel Aviv, said \"I can no longer bear this nightmare. The angel of death, Netanyahu, continues to sacrifice the hostages\". During the October 2023 attack, militants abducted 251 hostages, 55 of whom remain in Gaza, including 31 the Israeli military says are dead.

    "title": "WorldPride attendees to march through Washington in defiance of Trump",
    "article_text": "World World People attend the WorldPride parade in Washington, DC, US, Jun 7, 2025. (Photo: REUTERS/Annabelle Gordon) WASHINGTON: LGBTQ+ people from around the world will march through the streets of Washington on Saturday (Jun 7) in a joyful celebration meant to show defiance to President Donald Trump's rollback of queer rights. The parade route will come within one block of the White House grounds in one of the final main events of the weeks-long WorldPride celebration. On Sunday a more political event, dubbed a rally and march, will convene at the Lincoln Memorial, a revered space in the US civil rights movement as the site of Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech in 1963. Events will play out in the US capital in the wake of the Trump administration's measures to curtail LGBTQ+ rights. The Republican president has issued executive orders limiting transgender rights, banning transgender people from serving in the armed forces, and rescinding anti-discrimination policies for LGBTQ+ people as part of a campaign to repeal diversity, equity and inclusion programs. While proponents of DEI consider it necessary to correct historic inequities, the White House has described it as a form of discrimination based on race or gender, and said its transgender policy protects women by keeping transgender women out of shared spaces. Moreover, the White House said it has appointed a number of openly gay people to cabinet posts or judgeships, and noted that the Trump administration took steps to decriminalize homosexuality globally, and that its 2019 initiative \"Ending the HIV Epidemic\" aimed to cut HIV infections by 90 per cent by 2030. \"The President is honored to serve all Americans,\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in a statement. Event organizers said they were unaware of any counterprotests or anti-LGBTQ+ demonstrations planned for Saturday or Sunday. The National Park Service, however, has decided to fence off Dupont Circle, a popular public space, until Sunday night at the request of the US Park Police, which said closure was necessary to \"secure the park, deter potential violence, reduce the risk of destructive acts and decrease the need for extensive law enforcement presences\". Capital Pride Alliance, which is organizing WorldPride events, said it was \"frustrated and disappointed\" at the closure. \"This beloved landmark is central to the community that WorldPride intends to celebrate and honor. It's much more than a park, for generations it's been a gathering place for DC's LGBTQ+ community, hosting First Amendment assemblies and memorial services for those we lost to the AIDS epidemic and following tragic events like the Pulse nightclub shooting,\" the alliance said.

Depay profited from a defensive error to give the Dutch the lead inside six minutes, and Dumfries added a second with a neat finish at the back post midway through the first half. The Netherlands moved third in Group G with three points, behind leaders Poland, who have won both their games, and Finland who have four points from three matches. It was a professional performance from the Dutch, who were settled by their early goals and could then coast through the second half to secure a first victory in their World Cup qualification opener since 2012.

    "article_text": "Business Business File photo of the European Union and China flags, pictured during the China-EU summit at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China on Jul 12, 2016. (Photo: Reuters/Jason Lee) SHANGHAI: China is willing to accelerate the examination and approval of rare earth exports to European Union firms and will also deliver a verdict on its trade investigation of EU brandy imports by Jul 5, its commerce ministry said on Saturday (Jun 7). Price commitmentconsultations between China and the EUon Chinese-made electric vehicles exported to the EU have also entered a final stage but efforts from both sides are still needed, according to a statement on the Chinese Commerce Ministry's website. The issues were discussed between Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao and EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic in Paris on Tuesday, according to the statement. The comments mark progress on matters that have vexed China's relationship with the EU over the past year. Subscribe to our Chief Editor’s Week in ReviewOur chief editor shares analysis and picks of the week's biggest news every Saturday.This service is not intended for persons residing in the E.U. By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive news updates and promotional material from Mediacorp and Mediacorp’s partners.Loading Most recently, China's decision in April to suspend exports of a wide range of rare earths and related magnets has upended the supply chains central to automakers, aerospace manufacturers, semiconductor companies and military contractors around the world. The ministry said China attached great importance to the EU's concerns and \"was willing to establish a green channel for qualified applications to speed up the approval process\". In a separate statement the commerce ministry issued later on Saturday, it said China was willing to further strengthen communication and dialogue with relevant countries on rare earth export controls as it recognised that demand from sectors such as robotics and electric vehicles had risen. The ministry earlier said that Commerce Minister Wang during the meeting \"expressed the hope that the EU will meet us halfway and take effective measures to facilitate, safeguard and promote compliant trade in high-tech products to China\". Chinese anti-dumping measures that applied duties of up to 39 per cent on imports of European brandy - with French cognac bearing the brunt - have also strained relations between Paris and Beijing. The brandy duties were enforced days after the EU took action against Chinese-made electric vehicle imports to shield its local industry, prompting France's President Emmanuel Macron to accuse Beijing of \"pure retaliation\". The Chinese duties have dented sales of brands including LVMH's Hennessy, Pernod Ricard's Martell and Remy Cointreau. Beijing was initially meant to make a final decision on the brandy duties by January, but extended the deadline to April and then again to Jul 5. China's Commerce Ministry said on Saturday that French companies and relevant associations had proactively submitted applications on price commitments for brandy to China and that Chinese investigators had reached an agreement with them on the core terms. Chinese authorities were now reviewing the complete text on those commitments and would issue a final announcement before Jul 5, it said. In April, the European Commission said the EU and China had also agreed to look into setting minimum prices of Chinese-made electric vehicles instead of tariffs imposed by the EU last year. China's commerce ministry said the EU had also proposed exploring \"new technical paths\" relating to EVs, which the Chinese side was now evaluating.

    "article_text": "We have it on good authority thatOwen Wilson’sa Rolex man. Our source? The man himself relentlessly rocking the Crown throughout his career. In bothThe Life Aquatic with Steve ZissouandWedding Crashers, Wilson wore a GMT-Master II “Pepsi” ref. 16710. InThe Dajeeling Limited, he wore the black-and-blue “Batman”GMT-Master IIref. 116710. But in real life, it’s Wilson’sSubmariner“Hulk” ref. 116610LV that seems to get the most wrist time. Spotted in Los Angeles this week, Wilson wore the modern dive watch favorite with a classic sand-colored summer suit—an L.A. power fit if ever there was one.Submarinerdiehards will recall that the “Kermit”—a steel 40mm Submariner Date with a green bezel and black dial—debuted in 2003 in celebration of the model’s 50th anniversary. In 2010,Rolexfollowed it up with what fans dubbed the “Hulk,” a steel reference with both a green bezelanda green dial, this time contained in the chunkier “Super” case with thicker lugs and a “Maxi” dial with larger lume plots. The “Hulk,” like the “Kermit,” is a beloved Sub—the playful riff on the classic Submariner formula of steel case, black bezel insert, and black dial not only injects some variety into the model family, but it’s also a handsome design in and of itself. That it’s stainless steel rather than gold—other more colorful Sub dials only come on precious metal references—is also an attractive trait, though of course the “Hulk” was difficult to buy at retail even in 2010. In 2020, Rolex discontinued it and replaced it with the ref. 126610LV, a modern “Kermit” with black dial and green bezel insert.Upsized to 41mm, the Submariner was now even further removed from its longtime relatively svelte proportions and instead properly chunky, causing some consternation amongst the horological cognoscenti. (Millions of people seem to be just fine with the updated spec, however, seeing as Rolex can’t keep them on shelves.) Currently, there’s no “Hulk” in the Crown’s catalog, and the hunt for one will thus take you to places like the secondary market Chrono24, where you’ll be obliged to drop somewhere in the neighborhood of $20K for a clean example. Wilson isn’t the first proliferator of hilarity to specialize in proper tool watches: Frequent collaboratorWill Ferrellis aseriouswatch guy, withTudor chronographs,Zenith El Primeros, andgoofy field watchesin his arsenal. Ben Stiller, meanwhile, has been spotted inblacked-out Panerais, and Steve Carell dutifully donned aSpeedy forSpace Force. Frankly, these are enough tough-guy watches amongst the Frat Pack to outfit a Special Forces squadron, even if the only mission these dudes should be sent on is the type that played out inTropic Thunder. I don’t know if this guy’s our next Bond or not, but I do know that he’s copped a ton of 007 gear since his bigOmega announcementa couple of weeks back. Case in point: The Omega Seamaster Diver 300M that he wore to the28 Year Laterphotocall in Paris. The Seamaster Diver 300M, you’ll recall, has been James Bond’s watch since 1995’sGoldeneye—which, for you fellow millennials, was 30 freaking years ago.Taylor-Johnson’swatch, a ref. 210.30.42.20.01.001, is a larger, modern version of Brosnan’s timepiece, with a 42-mm steel case, a matching bracelet, a black“wave” dial, and the automatic Omega cal. 8800 movement. English footballerHarry Kanewore the platinum version of thePatek Philippe Cubitusto the F1 Grand Prix of Spain in Barcelona last weekend. One of the original launch references when the Cubitusdebuted last fall in Munich, the ref. 5822P-001 boasts several complications. An outsized date is featured below 12 o’clock, while a combination moonphase and day display is situated between 6 o’clock and 9 o’clock. Measuring 45 mm wide and 9.6 mm tall, it’s a large watch, though the brand also debuted more compact, non-complicated white and rose gold versions at this year’sWatches and Wonders in Geneva. ActorDrew StarkeyofQueerandOuter Banksfame wore a delightfulTank Louis Cartierto Netflix’s big showcase last weekend. Measuring 22mm x 29.5mm in yellow gold, this Tank features a black lacquer dial set with 151 brilliant-cut diamonds totalling 0.71 carats—plus one more in the beaded crown for good measure. Of all the special Tank Louis models from the past few years, this has to be one of the most spectacular. Unfortunately, it’s not part of the current Cartier catalog and is rather hard to track down. (Get yourself astarring role opposite Daniel Craig, and you may find that your chances of snagging one increase, however.) “Tiffany” Blue-inspired madness continuesto execute a chokehold upon the industry.Lionel MessiandCarlos Alcarazboth got the message, rockingTudor Black Bay Chrono “Flamingo Blue”andRolex Cosmograph Daytonawatches, respectively, with brightly hued dials. And while securing an actual Tiffany-signed blue dial will require you tracking down a now-discontinuedNautilus ref. 5711, finding a watch with a sky blue face is getting easier and easier. Rolex (and Tudor) seem to specialize in them these days, and other brands are also joining the fray. One thing’s for sure: The sunny colorway is the perfect summertime look.",

    "title": "How Timothée Chalamet Linked Up With This Insidery LA Streetwear Brand",
    "article_text": "Before the New York Knicks lost to the Indiana Pacers in Indianapolis last weekend, an amped-up Timothée Chalamet, sitting alongside his girlfriend, Kylie Jenner, stood watch on the sidelines, barking at the refs like he was a coach himself. Even if you didn’t already know that the actoris a diehard Knicks fan, it was clear by his outfit—a loud blue-and-orange suede jacket set with peanut-butter Timbs—which team he was rooting for. The look was custom-made by Doni Nahmias, whose sporty namesake brand is a favorite among NBA pros and Hollywood’s men about town,including Justin Bieber. But thanks to a linkup via their respective partners, the designer has become known especially as one of Chalamet’s go-to fashion collaborators. Timothée Chalamet, in a custom Nahmias set, with Kylie Jenner in Indianapolis on May 31. Nahmias and Chalamet first connected the same waythat many adult straight men do: “We met because our girlfriends are friends,” said Nahmias, whose girlfriend, Victoria Villarroel, is Jenner’s pal and former assistant. Before long, the guys discovered their shared love of fashion and basketball; now, theyplay pickup games together. “He’s a hooper,” the designer confirmed. Last year, Nahmias produced a simple, on-theme hoodie for Chalamet to wear as he embarked on an international press tour to promote the Bob Dylan biopicA Complete Unknown. The actor wore the sweatshirt—a black hoodie with the film’s title printed plainly in white, all-lowercase, sans-serif typeface—at an early promo stop at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis (where Dylan himself attended for one semester in 1959), and again, notably, during his appearance onTheo Von’sThis Past Weekendpodcast last December. When it seemed like enough fans wanted anA Complete Unknownhoodie of their own, the duo put out a limited run of 100 hoodies priced at $195 each, which, according to Nahmias, “sold out in seconds” in January. “The collaboration with Doni came about naturally,” ChalamettoldVoguethen. “It began with an appreciation for the comfort of his hoodies, and evolved into a friendship over the past year.” Designer Doni Nahmias, right, and Chalamet at a Knicks-Lakers game on March 6. Throughout the wily press tour, Chalamet and his stylist, Taylor McNeill, incorporated other Nahmias pieces into his conspicuous wardrobe, which was otherwise filled with city-specific designer pulls (Chanel in Paris; Prada in Rome) and cranked-up, SoCal-skeeze streetwear frombrands like True Religionand Chrome Hearts. During his double-duty hosting gig onSaturday Night Live, Chalamet wore several hoodies and a bottle-green leather jacket by the brand, plus a fur-trimmed Nahmias hoodie and bug-eyed sunglassesto perform Dylan’s “Outlaw Blues.” Since then, he’s worn the brand’s baseball capson LA bagel runsand, most recently, on a theater date night with Jenner to see Tony nomineeCole EscolainOh, Mary!on Broadway. Chalamet, in a fur-trimmed Nahmias hoodie, performing onSNLin January. The actor, in a Nahmias cap, backstage with Cole Escola and Kylie Jenner in NYC on May 30. On a bagel run in LA on April 4. “He’s got this natural aura that makes everything look really cool,” Nahmias said of Chalamet. “He has an incredibly authentic sense of style. He’s open-minded, creative, and down to push boundaries.” So when the Knicks found themselves in the midst of a historic playoff run this spring, Chalamet and Nahmias—who attended a Knicks-Lakers game together in March—merged their collective interests to cook up a custom look for Chalamet’s highly publicized courtside residency. Per Nahmias, the actor wanted “a loud, special moment” for the Eastern Conference Finals. After ruminating on design sketches together, they decided on a splashy look for Game 6: a version of the brand’s “Ollie” pants and a matching jacket tailor-made in Italian suede. “I thought I’d be in the NBA when I was a kid, but that obviously didn't happen,” said Nahmias, who alsoplays in a rec leaguewith Bieber. For now, at least his designs are getting high-profile co-signs on the sidelines—and beyond.",

    "title": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia Returned to US to Face Migrant Smuggling Charges",
    "article_text": "Kilmar Abrego Garciawasflown backinto the United States from El Salvador on Friday to face federal criminal charges from PresidentDonald Trump’s administration after beingwrongfullydeported in March. The Maryland man is still detained—this time at Putnam County Jail in Tennessee—as the 29-year-old Salvadoran awaits his June 13 court date related to charges of transporting undocumented migrants. Abrego Garcia’s return comes after the Trump administrationrepeatedlyopposedcourt ordersrequiring the government to take steps to return him after his wrongful removal by immigration officials. “Today’s action proves what we’ve known all along—that the administration had the ability to bring him back and just refused to do so,”Andrew Rossman, a lawyer for Abrego Garcia, said. “It’s now up to our judicial system to see that Mr. Abrego Garcia receives the due process that the Constitution guarantees to all persons.” Abrego Garcia was erroneouslydeported on March 15, more than two months before the charges were filed, according to Reuters. He was held in El Salvador's mega-prison known as theTerrorism Confinement Center (or CECOT), despite a 2019orderthat found his life would be in danger if he were sent back. In April, the US Supreme Courtheldthat the Trump administration was required to \"facilitate\" the release of Abrego Garcia. AsThe New York Timesreportedlater that month, the Justice Department “seemed not to understand” the three court orders directing them to act, “or perhaps was simply ignoring them.” A member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus holds a picture of Kilmar Abrego Garcia during a news conference to discuss Abrego Garcia's arrest and deportation at Cannon House Office Building on April 9, 2025 in Washington, DC. Then, in May, Abrego Garcia was named in an indictment in Federal District Court in Nashville. The indictment,unsealedon Friday, accuses Abrego Garcia of belonging to the gang and taking part in a conspiracy for almost a decade to “transport thousands” of immigrants without documentation across the US, including minors. Trump hasrepeatedlyclaimed that Abrego Garcia’s tattoos are proof of his involvement in MS-13, despite several tattoo expertsaffirmingthat they are not indicative of gang relations. Abrego Garcia made an initial appearance in federal court in Nashville on Friday. The government moved to hold him in custody. Due to this indictment, Trump, immigration officials, and the Justice Department are able to frame Abrego Garcia’s return to the US not in the context of the multiple court orders requiring the administration to bring him back but in a different light—one in which they are moving forward with an active criminal investigation into organized crime. “Abrego Garcia has landed in the United States to face justice,” Attorney GeneralPam Bondisaid at a news conference in Washington. “This,” she added, “is what American justice looks like.” When Trump was asked if he had worked with PresidentNayib Bukeleof El Salvador to take steps to free Abrego Garcia, he responded, “I don’t want to say that. But he’s returned.” “And,” Trump continued, referring to the Tennessee case, “he should have never had to be returned. You take a look at what’s happened with him; you take a look at what they found in the grand jury and everywhere else.” A prison officer guards a cell at the maximum-security penitentiary CECOT (Center for the Compulsory Housing of Terrorism) on April 4, 2025 in Tecoluca, San Vicente, El Salvador. Bukele, who had previouslyclaimedhe would not release Abrego Garcia,wroteon social media on Friday, “We work with the Trump administration, and if they request the return of a gang member to face charges, of course, we wouldn’t refuse.” Ama Frimpong, the legal director for CASA, an immigrant rights group based in Maryland, said that Abrego Garcia’s wife,Jennifer Vasquez Sura, \u0000\u0000“is of course very happy that her husband is back on U.S. soil, at least as far as we know.” “But,” Frimpong noted, “of course, under very egregious and horrendous circumstances.” Your Guide to the2025 Tony Awards An Exclusive First Look atWicked: For Good The Chaos InsideJohnny Depp and Amber Heard’s Wedding What Is Going On WithPatti LuPone?

    "title": "Kidnapping Hoaxer Sherri Papini Sought Restraining Order For Online Critic",
    "article_text": "Sherri Papiniis no stranger to the courtroom. The Redding, California wife and mother who wasconvicted of lying to federal agentsabout the details of her allegedly faked kidnapping—a case that's drawn comparisons to the book andmovieGone Girl—spent time in front of a judge when she wassentenced to 18 months in prisonover the hoax; she's subsequently been in and out of the courthouse asshe battles her ex-husband,Keith Papini, over custody of the couple's two children. But this week, she returned to the docket for two different cases: to address a restraining order against a woman who's been allegedly attacking her online, and after her ex-boyfriend evicted her from the Shasta County home that he owns. Papini first reached national fame in November 2016, when she disappeared during a run near her Redding home. As detailed in 2024's Hulu docuseriesPerfect Wife: The Mysterious Disappearance of Sherri Papini, authorities say that while Keith mounted an increasingly frantic search for her, Sherri was at the SoCal home of her ex-boyfriend,James Reyes. She reappeared on Thanksgiving Day, claiming she'd been abducted and tortured by a pair of Hispanic women, a claim that FBI agents later revealed to be false. When the deception was revealed, Keith filed for divorce. Sherri didn't participate inPerfect Wife.But in a second docuseries released last month,Sherri Papini: Caught in the Lie, Sherri now claims that Reyes abducted and abused her after the two began an “emotional affair” as her relationship with Keith crumbled. According to Sherri, she initially lied about who kidnapped her out of fear that Keith would discover her early contact with Reyes and end their relationship. Reyes denies Sherri's version of events, and he's never been arrested or charged in the case. Sherri wasreleased from prisonin 2023, and at some point after that, she reportedly entered into a relationship with a man namedShawn Hibdon.Accordingto theRecord-Searchlight,while the two were dating, Papini moved into a home Hibdon owns in the small NorCal town of Shingletown. But the two parted ways, and in January Hibdon moved to formally evict her. But according to Papini, this is another situation in which she has been targeted. “The plaintiff (Hibdon) has made threats both implied and explicit ― that unless I purchase the home under specific, unfavorable terms, I will be evicted, publicly humiliated or face further harm to my personal financial well-being,” Papini said in a court filing. Hibdon denies Papini's allegations. His attorney,Elizabeth Elizondo, said via statement that Papini “threatened to involve the media if settlement negotiations were not pursued under her terms. There were also threats to release potentially embarrassing messages involving the plaintiff … These actions appear to be aimed at publicly humiliating the plaintiff — the very thing she has accused us of doing to her.” On Friday, Papini—who is representing herself—asked to meet with the judge privately to discuss the eviction case, but was denied. The case is ongoing. But just a few days before, another case involving Papini was dismissed, this one involving her current boyfriend,Anthony Bickel. Accordingto theRecord-Searchlight, Papini was in Shasta County Superior Court on Wednesday, where she alleged that a fellow Shingletown resident,Katherine Parrick, had defamed her online, and had driven by her home and taken photos of her gate. According to afundraisermounted by Parrick, Bickel, her partner of 16 years, left her for Papini in recent months, allegedly leaving her and her 11-year-old daughter homeless. “I was simply telling my story,” Parrick told reporters outside the courtroom. “I think she wanted me to shut the heck up, because she's trying to portray a new image to the world, and by me telling the truth, it shows that her image is false.” After a conversation with both parties' attorneys, CommissionerJohn Berglunddismissed the case, and had a stern admonishment for both women. “Both of you live in a small town,” he said. “It is important for both of you to remember how your actions affect others.” Papini attorneyChase Kinney(who also appears inCaught in the Lie) says via statement that Sherri took out the restraining order “because she wanted the harassment and exploitation of her name — and that of a minor child — to stop… By dismissing the restraining order, Ms. Papini avoids further feeding into unnecessary drama and preserves her energy for what truly matters: her children and her future.\" Your Guide to the2025 Tony Awards An Exclusive First Look atWicked: For Good The Chaos InsideJohnny Depp and Amber Heard’s Wedding What Is Going On WithPatti LuPone?

    "title": "Elon Musk Suffers The Second-Biggest Wealth Loss In Human History",
    "article_text": "Elon Musk's ongoingwar of wordswith PresidentDonald Trumphas hit him where it hurts. No, not his ego—you can take a look at his Fridaynight spent retweetingfawningremarks from supportersto see that nothing's changed, there. But thefather of 14(that we know about) took a major hit tohis money hoardon Thursday, reportedly losing $34 billion of his personal fortune in the second-biggest single day personal wealth loss ever. It's an upsetting reminder that even though we're all been chuckling overthe he said/he said of it all—is Trump shading Musk'sadmitted GLP-1 agonist usewith that “Elon was ‘wearing thin’” slam? Didn't everybodyalready know aboutTrump'swell-documented relationshipwith convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein?—there's a very real cost to the battle of the billionaires. Just kidding! It's not upsetting at all (unless you're one of those sycophantic tweeters, I suppose). The adaptation of “The Scorpion and the Frog” we've been watching since Thursday (real life plot twist: the frog is also an asshole!) has erased a figure roughly equivalent to the GDP of Iceland from Musk's personal holdings,Bloomberg reports. And that number might be even worse for Elon Musk, reports the outlet, as that $34 billion figure “doesn’t reflect any damage to the value of his private enterprises — an increasingly important source of his net worth.” For example, the early Tesla investor is also the company's CEO…and I don't knowif you've heard, but the company hasbeen struggling lately. Stock for the publicly owned electric vehicle company was down 14.3% on Thursday,reports Salon, signaling a $150 billion loss in market value. CEO of Tesla and SpaceX Elon Musk leaves the stage holding a chainsaw after speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) at the Gaylord National Resort Hotel and Convention Center on February 20, 2025 in Oxon Hill, Maryland. Then there are the contracts Musk's SpaceX and other companies have with the federal government. “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it,” Trump noted on social media Thursday—even asnews broke thatthe federal government was hustling to rehire workers fired by thechainsaw-wieldingmagnate-led DOGE. Ending that relationship would be harder than Trump's post might suggest, as,perThe New York Times, NASA and the Pentagon are “intensely reliant” on SpaceX tech. But future contracts now seem less certain. The entire situation is a world away from November 2024, when Musk's multi-million-dollar investment in Trump's campaign for president (\"Without me, Trump would have lost the election,\" Musktweeted Thursday) seemedready to pay off big. Muskwas worth $464 billionon December 17, 2024, a notable bounce back from November 2021, when Musk suffered theworld's worst-ever personal wealth loss. That's right, Musk now occupies the #1 and #2 spots on the loser leaderboard, with only (as of Friday) his now-reduced fortune of $334.5 billion left to comfort him. He still has more money than anyone else on earth—but, still, that's got to hurt. If only there were a way toease that pain.

    "title": "Vanity Fair and UTA Toast Cynthia Erivo and the Broadway Community at Tony Awards Party",
    "article_text": "Everything’s coming up roses for the Broadway community this Tony season. On Friday,Vanity Fairand UTA hosted a soirée celebratingWickedstarCynthia Erivo, ahead of her big night hostingTony Awards 2025this Sunday. Although there’s plenty of drama to be found off stage this year (see:Patti LuPone’s colorful commentsabout Tony Award winnersAudra McDonaldandKecia Lewis, andthe ensuing brouhaha)the vibes on the terrace of the Times Square Edition were refreshingly relaxed as the stars of Broadway toasted to an incredible season. “It’s mad,” says Erivo, using a Britishism to describe the bustling scene at The Edition. Even before the event, the Tony-winner had a whirlwind of a day, releasing her albumI Forgive Youand prepping to host Broadway’s biggest night. She was soon ensconced in a conversation with legendaryLion KingdirectorJulie Taymorand snagged a picture withVanity Fair’s acting editor in chiefDaniel Kilebefore she had to depart—somehow, she’s headlining D.C. pride on Saturday. “She’s such an extraordinary human being and artist,” saidPatrick Herold, the co-head of theater at UTA withRachel Viola, of their client Erivo. “When you sit with her, she feels so authentic, so real. This incredible energy that comes off of her.” Jay Gassner, UTA partner and co-head of talent, shared the sentiment. “It’s exciting that we’re honoring Cynthia, and we have the most nominations we’ve ever had,” he said. “This is the best year we’ve ever had as a group, and we’re just getting started.” Cynthia Erivo, Nancy Gates, Jay Gassner, Daniel Kile, and Ben Coleman Decorated with white roses and the scent of Parfums de Marly wafting through the air, the Times Square Edition was transformed into the perfect venue to fête Broadway’s hottest stars. Tony nomineeJak Malone,decked out in pearls and a blue sweater, and the cast of the British musicalOperation Mincemeatwere right on time, as were Tony nomineesJulia Knitel,Jeb Brown,and others from another best musical nomineeDead Outlaw, both talking shop in their own respective corners. There were also allies to the theater industry as well, like actor and singerJoshua Bassett,the one-time subject of bothOlivia RodrigoandSabrina Carpentersongs, and choreographerJustin Peck,who last year won a Tony forIllinoise. “It feels like Broadway is really back,” said Tony-winnerKara Young.Although she’s nominated for best supporting actress inBranden Jacobs-Jenkins’s Pulitzer Prize-winning best play nomineePurpose, Young has already made history as the first actress to receive four consecutive Tony nominations in a row, all in the best supporting actress category. Broadway is so back that Young had to rush out the door to get to her evening performance in time. Joy Woodsand Lewis also had call times to make. The Broadway stars chatted in the corner of the party, discussing the grind of Tony season on top of performing eight shows a week. “I know what I’m wearing. I know what time I got to be where I got to be. I’m gonna call one out on Sunday,” said Woods, who’s nominated for best supporting actress for her role as Louise opposite McDonald’s towering Mama Rose inGypsy. “The fact that they don’t even just give you that day as a paid day off, that’s the gag,” added Lewis, who won best supporting actress in a musical last year forHell’s Kitchen. “I’m taking a day off, and I ain’t even going to the damn Tonys. ’Cause I’m tired.” It’s part of the reason she’s moving into producing. “Actors feel resistance that producers can fix, and won’t. It’s not okay.” While some of the theater community is exhausted, others are simply happy to be there. “I am so excited,” saidGracie Lawrence.The actor and lead singer of indie band Lawrence scored her first nomination for best supporting actress in a musical for portraying Connie Francis inJust In TimeoppositeJonathan Groff. “There’s all this pressure that comes over the past few weeks, but now that it’s here I’m just purely excited,” she said. And there’s another reason she’s looking forward to Sunday: “Also, my dress is really cute.” Though Lawrence, like Lewis, Woods, and Young had to bounce from the party a bit early to make it to their respective shows, best actor in a musical nomineeJames Monroe Iglehartwas able to continue mixing and mingling while dining on light bites and bespoke, Broadway-themed cocktails like the Highball on the High Note.LaChanze,a producer and Broadway star who won a Tony for originating the role of Celie inThe Color Purple—the same part that would launch Erivo to fame 20 years later—was one of the stars who stuck around. “I’m so excited about this season because of the diversity of shows, fromDead OutlawtoBuena Vista Club, you name it,” she said. “There’s such a variety of genres and artists that are being premiered this season, which for me gives me hope for the future of inclusivity for theater. I think that’s how we’re going to really grow our audience.” LaChanze Speaking of growing,Little Shop of HorrorsstarsLiz GilliesandMilo Manheimalso made it to the function, thankfully leaving their carnivorous plant at home. For Gillies, returning to the theater this season has been the “most meaningful experience that I’ve had in a very long time,” she said. The actor got her start in the industry starring in13:The Musicalon Broadway opposite her best friend,Ariana Grande.Now, she’s returned to the boards, starring as Audrey in the hit Off-Broadway production and she’s got no plans of leaving the stage just yet. “I’m so looking forward to continuing. I felt my time wasn’t quite done yet,” she said. At the party, she was able to reunite with13: The Musicalcomposer, Tony-winnerJason Robert Brown, who was also in attendance despite his glitzy-revivalThe Last Five Years(which starsNick JonasandAdrienne Warren) not earning any Tony nominations. Brown was rather circumspect about the problems facing the theater industry. “There’s this real tension in this city, in this particular theater community about how much everything costs versus how much everyone is compensated. That tension colors the work and it colors what's happening on stage, but it doesn’t make its way into the audience,” he explained. “It’s very scary to do new work in an environment with that kind of tension around it. That’s exactly the kind of tension that doesn’t help new work.” Tala Ashe Nevertheless, he’s excited to see new productions thrive in an environment that he finds more hostile than the past. “It’s been very encouraging to see shows likeMaybe Happy EndingorJohn Proctor Is the Villain, managed to get traction in spite of a commercial environment that seems, to me, to be fighting against them.” His wife, composerGeorgia Stitt,is happy that theater is even happening given how uncertain and precarious the last few years have been for the industry following COVID-19. “We were all writing and trying to figure out what we were doing and nothing was getting produced,” she said. “I remember thinking, ‘I’m writing theater. I don’t know if theater is ever going to happen again. We were working and it was illegal to sing. What if you spit on each other?” Arian Moayed Others remain optimistic about the enduring power of the artform. “It’s never going to go away,” saidArian Moayed, theSuccessionstar and Tony nominee who starred oppositeJessica ChastaininJamie Lloyd’s revival ofA Doll’s House. “It’s from the beginning of time, the theater. It’s outlasted everything.

The department checked a batch of lifeguard records with the Hong Kong China Life Saving Society that day and found that the credentials of an attendant who was on duty earlier in the week at the swimming pool in San Francisco Towers did not match official records. “As the qualification of the life-saving attendant is in doubt and the swimming pool has allegedly failed to provide a sufficient number of qualified life-saving attendants as required by law, the department has ordered the immediate closure of the pool and is considering prosecuting its licensee,” the department said on Friday evening. “The incident has been reported to police, and the [department] has also notified the Property Management Services Authority to take parallel follow-up action.” San Francisco Towers is a high-end, two-block private estate on 29-35 Ventris Road.",
