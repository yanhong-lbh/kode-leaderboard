    "title": "Viral 'McMigraine' remedy has some rushing to McDonald's for headache relief",
    "article_text": "After seeing a TikTok video, Olivia Foley of Manchester, U.K., booked a skiing trip with her father to Sweden to try out the world's only ski-thru McDonald's, McSki, saying the long journey was \"absolutely worth it.\" Some McDonald's customers on TikTok claim that a certainfood and drinkcombination from the fast-food restaurant can get rid of their migraines — though doctors are quick to share other headache remedies. A migraine is a headache that can cause \"severe throbbing pain or a pulsing sensation, usually on one side of the head,\" according to the Mayo Clinic. Common effects include nausea, vomiting and extreme sensitivity to light and sound. The attacks can last for hours or even days, interfering with daily activities, the same source noted. MCDONALD'S SECRET DRINK ITEM WITH 'COTTON CANDY FLAVOR' GOES VIRAL Taking a trip through theMcDonald's drive-thrumight help, some customers claim. One viral video – which has over three million views and counting – shows a woman sitting in her car in a McDonald's drive-thru, sipping a soda and eating fries. The text said she's doing this \"because I'vehad a headachefor 48 hours and TikTok said it would help.\" A large Coca-Cola drink and an order of large fries is \"lovingly called the McMigraine,\" a doctor told Fox News Digital.(Peter Burke/Fox News Digital) Other videos suggest a large Coca-Cola drink and an order of large fries – \"lovingly calledthe McMigraine,\" Dr. Brintha Vasagar told Fox News Digital – can make the pain go away. \"There is some science [as] to why it works,\" noted the Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based family medical physician. While this viral food hack may help alleviate the symptoms, it isn't a cure, a doctor cautioned. The caffeineand the carbonationin Coca-Cola are two of the reasons, according to Vasagar. \"If you think about most over-the-counter migraine treatments, the medications themselves can contain a dose of caffeine,\" she said. MCDONALD'S CHEF REVEALS WHY COFFEE FROM FAST-FOOD GIANT TASTES SO GOOD The caffeine constricts or narrows the blood vessels, which can provide migraine relief for some people, the doctor added. The carbonation can help settle the stomach for those who experience nausea with their headaches. A viral hack on TikTok suggests people seek migraine relief at McDonald's.(iStock) When it comes to the salty fries, the sodium can help correct electrolyte balance and dehydration — \"which can be triggers,\" Vasagar said. The carbohydrates in the fries can also helpsettle the stomach, she added. Another element, Vasagar said, is the \"psychological benefit of comfort food.\" FAST-FOOD MENU ITEMS THAT CHEFS LIKE TO EAT \"For many of us, fast food, McDonald's, it's that nostalgia. It's that feeling of, 'This is going to be comforting and make me feel better.'\" One person on TikTok wrote, \"Iwork in neurologyand our headache specialist literally recommends this to patients.\" Another person wrote that only Coca-Cola is effective, not Diet Coke. Others agreed with that. Some users on TikTok said the remedy works best with a large Coca-Cola, not Diet Coke.(Peter Burke/Fox News Digital) \"There is no scientific reason that one Coke over another should be beneficial formigraine treatment,\" Vasagar clarified. \"I really think that piece plays into the psychological part of it — what feels comforting to people when [they're] feeling ill.\" This viral food hack isn't a cure, the doctor pointed out. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER \"This isn't a prevention measure,\" Vasagar said. \"It's not like you can do the ‘McMigraine’ every day and never get a migraine again. That's just not the way it works.\" Also, drinking alarge Cokeand eating a bunch of fries could make matters worse for some. Eating a large order of fries could actually trigger migraines for some people, doctors warn.(Michal Fludra/NurPhoto via Getty Images) \"Triggers for migraines vary from person to person,\" Vasagar warned. \"So, this combination for some people will make their migraines worse.\" For more Lifestyle articles, visitfoxnews.com/lifestyle Dr. Tania Elliott, a New York-based physician who specializes in allergies and internal medicine, told Fox News Digital that a better quick-fix solution is to stay hydrated. \"Consider having a little bit of caffeine, maybe in the form ofmatcha or green tea,\" and keep your electrolytes up, she suggested.

    "article_text": "Fox News correspondent Mark Meredith breaks down Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's latest alleged Signal chat controversy on 'Special Report.' A retired four-star admiral who once served as the Navy’s second-highest ranking officer, wasconvicted of briberyand other conspiracy charges, making him the most senior member of the U.S. military ever convicted of committing a federal crime while on active duty. Following a five-day trial, retired four-star Adm. Robert P. Burke, 62, was found guilty on Monday of a scheme to direct lucrative contracts to a training company in exchange for a $500,000-a-year job after leaving the Navy, according to a news release from the Department of Justice. Burke is facing up to 30 years in prison for his role in the scheme to direct contracts potentially worth millions of dollars to a New York City-based company that offered training programs to the Navy. \"When you abuse your position and betray the public trust to line your own pockets, it undermines the confidence in the government you represent,\"U.S. Attorney Jeanine Ferris Pirrowrote in a post on X following the conviction. RETIRED NAVY ADMIRAL CHARGED WITH BRIBERY FOR ALLEGEDLY OFFERING GOVERNMENT CONTRACT IN EXCHANGE FOR JOB (U.S. Navy) \"Our office, with our law enforcement partners, will root out corruption – be it bribes or illegal contracts – and hold accountable the perpetrators, no matter what title or rank they hold,\" Pirro continued. Burke, who served as vice chief of naval operations, was once theNavy’s second-highest ranking officer. According to court documents and as the evidence proved at trial, from 2020 to 2022, Burke was a four-star admiral who oversaw U.S. naval operations in Europe, Russia, and most of Africa, and commanded thousands of civilian and military personnel. Yongchul \"Charlie\" Kim and Meghan Messenger, co-CEOs of a company not named by the DOJ, allegedly participated in the scheme to get a government contract in exchange for offering Burke a position with the company. The company provided a training program for a small partof the Navyfrom 2018 and 2019, before their contract was terminated.

Burke (L) in Istanbul, Turkey on April 20, 2021.(Arif Akdogan/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) The company was told by the Navy not to contact Burke, but the three met in Washington, D.C., in July 2021 and Burke allegedly agreed to use his influence to get the company a sole-source contract and urge other Naval officers to use the company for a more widespread training program that Kim estimated would be worth \"triple digit millions.\" In December 2021, Burke allegedly ordered his staff to award the company a $355,000 contract to train Naval personnel under his command in Italy and Spain and made an unsuccessful attempt to convince a senior Naval commander to give them another contract. \"There was no connection between this contract and his employment. The math just doesn’t make sense that he would give them this relatively small contract for that type of job offer,\" Burke's defense attorney, Timothy Parlatore, previously told Fox News Digital. Burke allegedly implied that he had no role in awarding the contract, and that his discussions with Kim and Messenger didn’t start until after the contract started.

Parlatore told Fox News Digital that they are \"obviously disappointed by the verdict,\" but said \"this is a result of the fact that the jury did not get to hear the whole story.\" \"The investigation was very poorly conducted.

    "article_text": "NTSB officials says there was \"no significant structural damage to the load-bearing elements\" of the Brooklyn Bridge after a Mexican navy tall ship crashed into the iconic New York City span Saturday night. Officials said Monday that an inspection of the Brooklyn Bridge inNew York Citydetermined the load-bearing elements of the structure did notsustain any significant damagewhen a Mexican navy sailing ship crashed into the landmark on Saturday night, killing two people on board. The New York City Department of Transportation announced the discovery in a post on X just before the National Transportation and Safety Board (NTSB) held a press conference regarding its investigation into the tragic incident. \"This morning, Commissioner Rodriguez surveyed the Brooklyn Bridge following the weekend bridge strike,\" the city agency said. \"While inspections are ongoing, there are no signs of structural damage to the bridge.\" NTSB officials told reporters that its bridge team from the Office of Highway Safety is working with NYC DOT and confirmed the lack of structural damage to the bridge.

But nothing structural from the bridge… is an issue at this plan.\" NTSB Investigator Brian Young told reporters that, based on preliminary navigational data, the Mexican navy tall ship Cuauhtémoc arrived in New York City on May 13 at about noon and docked port side at pier 17. The vessel remained docked for about four days, before pushing away from the dock at about 8:20 p.m. on May 17, with the assistance of a tugboat. \"The intent was to sail south down the East River and head for sea,\" Young said. The preliminary investigation looked atweather data, which showed westerly winds of about 10 knots, along with a current running toward the bridge at about 0.3 knots. NTSB SAYS LACK OF 'VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT' BY MARYLAND OFFICIALS PRECEDED DEADLY KEY BRIDGE COLLAPSE NTSB board member Michael Graham spoke to reporters about the investigation into what caused a Mexican navy tall ship to strike the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday night.(Fox News) The vessel's speed increased to about 6 knots, and at 8:24, a VHF radio broadcast was sounded requesting assistance from other tugboats in the area of the Brooklyn Bridge, he continued. \"That was followed by two other requests for assistance, and at 8:24:45, the vessel’s mast struck the underside of the Brooklyn Bridge,\" Young said. \"At 8:27, the vessel came to a stop, and at 8:30, both NYPD and FDNY assets were on the scene.\" The members of the NTSB arrived in New York City on Sunday, and Monday was the first day crews were able to start investigating the incident. Graham said the team is there to gather perishable evidence, which will take as many days as needed. NTSB LAUNCHES 'GO-TEAM' OF SPECIALIZED INVESTIGATORS AFTER BROOKLYN BRIDGE STRUCK BY MEXICAN NAVY SHIP The New York City Department of Transportation inspected the Brooklyn Bridge after it was struck by a Mexican navy sailboat, and discovered it did not sustain any significant damage to the load-bearing structure.(NYC DOT/X) He also said this was the start of a long process, telling reporters that investigations cantake between 12 and 24 months. Within 30 days, Graham and his team will provide a preliminary report, but throughout the process, he stressed, the team will not draw conclusions, speculate, or determine probable cause while on the scene. The investigation will involve looking at the crew and the operation of the crew, the vessel and its condition, and nautical elements like weather, wind and tide. On Monday morning, various teams were set up by the NTSB to look into nautical operations, marine engineering, bridge engineering, survival factors and recorders. Young told reporters that the team did not know whether the ship had a recorder, like a black box, on board.

One reporter asked Graham and Young about preliminary information released by the NYPD, suggesting there was a power outage that may have led to the ship’s collision with the bridge. \"We don’t know where they got that data from,\" Graham said. \"Brian has told us already we haven’t even had a chance to access the engine, so, we don’t know that. We haven’t had a chance to look to see if there’s any recorded data or anything like that. So, we’re not sure where they got that from, but that will be part of the investigation, too. If somebody has information like that, where did they get it from? We don’t know at this point.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP NTSB investigators will speak with witnesses, crew members, tugboat operators and others to help get a full picture of what caused the ship to crash on Saturday night. They will also look for surveillance cameras in the area to help piece together the puzzle.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegsethsaid the Pentagon is working to stay ahead in modern warfare amid drone and artificial intelligence advancements on the battlefield. Hegseth, a former \"Fox & Friends Weekend\" co-host, sat down with \"The Will Cain Show\" Monday at the Pentagon, where he laid out the Trump administration’s posture toward China amid an arms race with the communist country and adversaries like Russia and Iran. \"We concede nothing to the communist Chinese.

Chinese technology company DJI touts itself as the world's leading manufacturer of consumer and commercial drones and has a hefty presence in U.S. and Asian markets. Craig Singleton, a senior China fellow at the non-partisan Foundation for Defense of Democracies,told Fox News Digitalthat the Shenzhen-based company dominates the global drone market, controlling more than 70% of the worldwide market share. \"That’s alarming, because DJI drones are essentially data collectors for Beijing — giving China potential access to sensitive infrastructure imagery, flight patterns, and more.

    "article_text": "Ambassador Danny Danon tells Fox News Digital at the Jerusalem Post conference in New York that he demanded a retraction from a U.N. official for saying Israel was conducting a genocide in Gaza. FIRST ON FOX:Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon slammed international criticism from the U.K., France and Canada over Israel's war against Hamas terrorists. Responding to the criticism, Danon told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview at the Jerusalem Post conference in New York that whileIsrael valuesinternational law, it will not stop fighting Hamas until all hostages are released. \"We have58 hostagesin Gaza. This war will not end when the hostages are left behind. We will bring all of them back,\" Danon said, emphasizing Israel's determination to finish the war and bring home those held captive. Danon also expressed frustration that the international community has not placed more pressure on Hamas over the hostages, urging those countries to make stronger statements on their behalf. The joint statement issued by the leaders of the United Kingdom, France and Canada condemned Israel's military operations in Gaza, criticizing the humanitarian situation and calling for an immediate ceasefire. The statement also urged Israel to allow more aid into Gaza, specifically calling on the Israeli government to engage with theUnitedNationsto resume aid in line with humanitarian principles and to push for the release of all hostages held by Hamas. ISRAEL TURNS TABLES ON UN OFFICIAL CLAIMING 'GENOCIDE' IN GAZA WITH BASIC QUESTIONS IDF forces are seen operating in Rafah, a city in the Gaza Strip.(IDF Spokesman's Office) Danon also took issue with remarks made by Tom Fletcher, the U.N.'s undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs, who accused Israel of committing genocide during his speech before the U.N. Security Council. Fletcher criticized Israel’s actions in Gaza, stating that most of the region was either under Israeli military control or subjected to displacement orders. \"What Mr. Fletcher said at the Security Council was unacceptable and shameful, accusing us for committing a genocide. He knows better than that. That’s a libel and I expect him to take back those words and apologize. We will not work with him until he will make it clear that Israeli isn’t committing a genocide. We have no intention for that, he knows that. We are doing our best to defeat theterror group Hamas. We will defeat Hamas, but blaming us for committing such atrocities, that is something we cannot accept from any U.N. official.\" ISRAELI FOREIGN MINISTER SLAMS UN, CALLS IT 'ROTTEN, ANTI-ISRAEL, AND ANTISEMITIC BODY' Tom Fletcher, United Nations undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs(REUTERS/Denis Balibouse) Regarding the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the recent opening of the borders to allow aid trucks into Gaza after two months, Fletcher commented on X, calling Israel's temporary permission to deliver limited aid a \"drop in the ocean.\" Danon stressed that the aid was only granted to NGOs that ensure Hamas does not infiltrate their ranks or loot aid intended for civilians. \"Let’s stick to the facts,\" Danon said. \"We are still expecting a retraction of the inappropriate libel that you asserted last week at the Security Council.\" In a briefing today, Stéphane Dujarric, spokesperson for the secretary-general, also referenced the statement by Fletcher, who stressed that the scale of aid is still insufficient to meet the overwhelming needs of the population. He called for more crossings to be opened and for the simplification of procedures to ensure a regular flow of aid, emphasizing that without such measures, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza would continue to worsen. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Danny Danon, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, speaks during the Jerusalem Post's annual conference in New York.(Marc Israel Sellem/Jerusalem Post) Danon also addressed the future of humanitarian aid in Gaza, specifically in response to proposals for replacing the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) with a new U.S.-backed aid mechanism. \"We decided that UNRWA will not have anything connected to Israel. They know it, the U.N. knows it,\" he said, criticizing the U.N.'s role in the region. He voiced support for the U.S. initiative, calling it a welcome step toward addressing Gaza’s humanitarian crisis. \"I cannot understand how anyone can boycott a humanitarian effort,\" he added. \"If those people in the U.N. care so much about the humanitarian crisis, they should take part in these efforts, not boycott them.\" Fox News' Rachel Wolf contributed to this article.

    "article_text": "Fox Nation’s ‘American Presidents’ explores the tenures of the nation’s leaders from George Washington to Donald Trump. Michael A. Ledeen, a major American historian and intellectual, died after suffering a series of small strokes on Sunday at his daughter's house in Texas. He was 83 years old. Ledeen was a vigorous participant in contributing to the demise of thecommunist Soviet Unionand its Iron Curtain allies in Eastern Europe. Ledeen served as a special advisor on terrorism to President Ronald Reagan’s secretary of state, Alexander Haig, and later worked as a consultant for the National Security Council. Writing forthe Asia Times, author and journalist David P. Goldman argued that Ledeen’s \"personal contribution to America’s victory in the Cold War is far greater than the public record shows.\" Goldman noted that the Reagan administration, in 1983, sent Ledeen, a scholar of Italian history and fascism, to meet Italian Prime Minister Bettino Craxi to convince the Italian leader to allow the U.S. to deploy Pershing missiles to counter rising Soviet jingoism. Goldman added, \"The incident reflects the high trust that Ledeen commanded in the Reagan administration and the strategic role that he played.\" TRUMP SAYS US HAS GIVEN IRAN PROPOSAL FOR NUCLEAR DEAL Michael A. Ledeen, a major American historian and intellectual, died after suffering a series of small strokes on Sunday at his residence in Maryland. He was 83 years old.(Monica Schipper/Getty Images for Hamptons International Film Festival) After Italy accepted the Pershings, the then-Social Democratic German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, who was reluctant for his nation to be first to house Pershing missiles, agreed to Reagan’s demand. Leeden was a fan of former anti-communist American philosopher Sidney Hook, who declared during the Cold War that \"Freedom is a fighting word.\" Ledeen would take his hard-charging world view against a new set of U.S. enemies after the ground zero of communism was defeated:radical Islamism in Iran, North Korea’s totalitarian regime, and Arab and Latin American despots bent on the eradication of the U.S. In 2003, while working as the resident scholar in the Freedom Chair at the American Enterprise Institute, Ledeen wrote about former PresidentGeorge W. Bush’s Axis of Evil(Iran, North Korea and Iraq), \"Most commentators ridiculed the very idea of the Axis of Evil, just as they laughed at Reagan’s description of the Soviet Union as an Evil Empire. The deep thinkers laughed at Reagan, and then somberly warned that such language was not only misguided but provocative, as if the Kremlin would be more aggressive as a result of the president’s speech.\" President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev(Dirck Halstead/Getty Images) Ledeen stressed the importance of American leadership breeding inspiration among dissidents trapped in totalitarian systems: \"The greatest of the Soviet freedom fighters, from [Vladimir] Bukovsky to [Natan] Sharansky, have since written about the surge of hope they felt when they saw that the American president understood why they were fighting.\" He would bring his same intellectual freedom toolkit to his principal worry in this century: the Islamic Republic of Iran. Ledeen garnered enormous respect and praise from Iranian dissidents seeking to dissolve the theocratic regime in Tehran, the world’s worst state-sponsor of terrorism, according to the U.S. State Department. His wife, Barbara, told Fox News Digital about her late husband, \"My only regret is that he didn’t outlive the regime.\" IRAN’S LONG TRAIL OF DECEPTION FUELS SKEPTICISM OVER NEW NUCLEAR DEAL AS TALKS CONTINUE Iranians protest the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in Tehran on Oct. 1, 2022.(AP Photo/Middle East Images) Leeden did not advocate military intervention in Iran. He was in the business of replicating Reagan’s anti-Soviet playbook for Iran’s clerical regime. He toldFox News Brit Humein 2005 that \"the Western world, and in particular the United States\" needs to support political prisoners in Iran and demonstrations against the regime. He told Hume, \"We should be giving money to the various ... Farsi-language broadcasters, some here, some in England, some in Sweden and so forth, some in Germany, to go on the air and share with the Iranian people the now-demonstrated techniques for a successful, nonviolent revolution.\" British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher greets U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig in London on April 10, 1981.(AP1981) He coined the phrase \"Faster, please!\" for his widely read blog at PJ Media to denote the great urgency to dismantle America’s enemies and stop Islamist-animated terrorism. Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, paid tribute to Ledeen in a post on X. He wrote in part, \"Michael's understanding of the American people and the Jewish people formed the basis of his abiding faith in the future of America and Israel and in our enduring alliance and friendship.\" Ledeen was born in Los Angeles in 1941 and authored numerous books on national security, including \"Perilous Statecraft: An Insider’s Account of the Iran-Contra Affair.\" He earned a Ph.D. in history and philosophy from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. His academic advisor at Wisconsin was the prominent historian George Mosse, who fled Nazi Germanybecause of antisemitism.

Putin, in a statement after the call, also noted that \"a ceasefire with Ukraine is possible\" but noted \"Russia and Ukrainemust find compromises that suit both sides.\" Any concrete details on the nature of these compromises remain unclear, despite negotiation attempts in Turkey on Friday, whichTrump suggested failedbecause he needed to negotiate with Putin first. In the lead up to the talks, Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, along with other world leaders like UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron, who said they are discussed the urgent need for Putin to agree to an unconditional ceasefire or face serious repercussions including more sanctions.

    "article_text": "U.S. ambassador to NATO Matt Whitaker discusses President Donald Trump's role in securing peace in Ukraine, his upcoming phone call with NATO leaders and Iran's threat to the Trump administration over nuclear enrichment. Nearly a decade after the United Kingdom (U.K.) voted to leave the European Union (EU) under Brexit and amid shifting relations with the U.S. under PresidentDonald Trump, Britain and the EU significantly bolstered their trade and defense partnership on Monday. In what is the largest deal the bloc and the U.K. have agreed to since the controversial Brexit vote in 2016, the two economic powerhouses agreed to increase defense ties and slash red tape, making it not only easier for U.K. food and visitors to access the continent, but also granting fishing rights to EU vessels off of Britian’s coastline. The agreements have been described as a \"reset\" and championed byU.K. Prime Minister Kier Starmer, who opposed Brexit, and EU leader, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who said, \"At a time of global instability, and when our continent faces the greatest threat it has for generations, we in Europe stick together.\" TRUMP IS COMMITTED TO 10% BASELINE TARIFF, WHITE HOUSE SAYS, DESPITE UK TRADE DEAL ANNOUNCEMENT Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer, center, stands for a photo with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa ahead of a United Kingdom and European Union summit at Lancaster House in London on Monday, May 19, 2025.(Henry Nicholls/Pool Photo via AP) While the U.K. talked down the Trump administration’s 25% \"reciprocal\" tariffs earlier this month to limit the fees to 10% on up to 100,000 car exports to the U.S. – the U.K.’s chief export item to the States – the EU has reached no such agreement with Washington and faces 20% tariffs on all U.S. exports come July. While EU and U.S. officials are still working to find an agreement, reports on Monday suggested that even the existing 10% tariff slapped on the EU over the last 50 days has left a negative mark and thebloc anticipates a drop in growthfor 2025. However, it is not only Trump’s tariffs that have pushed Western allies to strengthen relations following his re-entry into the White House.

While the Trump administrationhas seemingly improved tieswith Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Trump’s refusal to outright condemn Russian President Vladimir Putin has resulted in stronger ties between top nations like the U.K., France and Germany, as well as within the EU bloc. At the heart of the new defense agreement is the U.K.’s ability to access an EU defense loan program worth roughly $170 billion, expanding joint defense procurement opportunities.

    "article_text": "President Donald Trump sat down with 'Special Report' anchor Bret Baier to discuss the significance of economics in creating peace on the world stage, signaling he'd be open to trading with Iran as he advocates for a nuclear deal. IranianPresident Masoud Pezeshkianspoke over the weekend, reiterating Iran’s commitment to dialogue and desire for a civilian nuclear program. The Iranian leader addressed navy officials in Bandar Abbas, discussing the ongoing negotiations for a deal with the United States. \"We are not seeking war, we favor negotiation and dialogue, but we are not afraid of threats either, and we will in no way retreat from our legal rights,\" Pezeshkian said. IRAN FOREIGN MINISTER VOWS NUCLEAR ENRICHMENT WILL CONTINUE 'WITH OR WITHOUT A DEAL' Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian walks on the sidelines of the 79th United Nations General Assembly at the U.N. headquarters in New York City on Sept. 24, 2024.(Reuters/Caitlin Ochs) Compared to previous Iranian presidents, Pezeshkian has emerged as a more level-headed and reformist leader, aiming to reach new understandings with the West, according toPolitico. The United States and Iran have completedfour rounds of indirect negotiationsregarding Iran’s nuclear program, though the public has received mixed messages on the path forward. While officials from Washington and Tehran have expressed optimism about the conversations, a number of technical details have yet to be discussed, including the specifics surrounding uranium enrichment and stockpile levels. The U.S. and Iran have completed four rounds of indirect negotiations regarding Iran’s nuclear program, but an agreement has not yet been reached. Iran is insisting they will continue to enrich uranium for civilian and research purposes, while the Trump administration is calling for all enrichment to end. Right now, Iran is enriching uranium to up to 60% purity, well beyond the confines of the 2015 nuclear deal that PresidentDonald Trumpwithdrew from in 2018. IRAN'S KHAMENEI LAUNCHES BLISTERING ATTACK ON TRUMP AFTER MIDDLE EAST VISIT Over the weekend, Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi commented on the current situation, saying that Iran has received no written proposal from the United States about an agreement. \"Mark my words: there is no scenario in which Iran abandons its hard-earned right to enrichment for peaceful purposes: a right afforded to all other NPT signatories, too,\" Ataghchi said in a post on X. In an interview with Fox News, Trump spoke about the ongoing talks with Iran, opening up the possibility of trade with the country, if the talks lead to a deal.

    "article_text": "U.S. ambassador to NATO Matt Whitaker discusses President Donald Trump's role in securing peace in Ukraine, his upcoming phone call with NATO leaders and Iran's threat to the Trump administration over nuclear enrichment. The United Kingdom and theEuropean Unionreached a landmark agreement centered on fishing rights and defense cooperation Monday, five years after Brexit. British Cabinet Office minister Nick Thomas-Symonds announced the deal as officials from both sides met in London for their first major summit since the U.K. formally left the 27-nation trade bloc in 2020. That followed a slim-margin 2016 referendum vote calling for the U.K.'s departure. The government of British Prime MinisterKeir Starmer,who met with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and other senior EU officials, billed the summit as a major milestone in resetting relations. \"Historic day,\" Thomas-Symonds wrote on X on Monday. \"After months of negotiations, I can announce that the Labour Government has secured a new agreement with the EU.\" Starmer’s chief negotiator said the agreement was good for jobs, bills, borders and more.

Starmer has stressed that the U.K. will not rejoin the EU's frictionless single market and customs union, nor agree to the free movement of people between the U.K. and the EU. The prime minister has faced growing challenges from the Reform U.K. party, which supported Brexit and opposesmass migration policiesupending the powerful island nation. Reform, which recently won big in local elections, and the opposition Conservative Party have already called the deal a \"surrender\" of U.K. sovereignty to EU leadership in Brussels. \"The white flag has been waved outside Downing Street. The great EU surrender by the UK is taking place as we speak,\" Reform UK's Richard Tice told British media, billing the deal as a betrayal of the terms of Brexit on fishing in particular. Talks on strengthening ties focused largely on security and defense, and on a youth mobility plan that would allow young Britons and Europeans to live and work temporarily in each other’s territory. That remains a politically touchy issue in the U.K., seen by some Brexiteers as inching back toward free movement, according to the Associated Press. The U.K. already has youth mobility arrangements with countries including Australia and Canada.

Disputes over the issuenearly derailed a Brexit dealback in 2020. The summit is also expected to cover aligning standards on the sale of agricultural products, which could eliminate costly checks on food products exported across the English Channel. Thomas-Symonds told the BBC he was confident that trade could be improved for food imports and exports. \"We know we’ve had lorries waiting for 16 hours, fresh food in the back not able to be exported, because frankly it’s just going off, red tape, all the certifications that are required, we absolutely want to reduce that,\" he reportedly said. TheNew York Timescited an unnamed European diplomat as saying the agreement will allow European boats access to U.K. fishing waters until June 30, 2038.

It’s unclear how Trump, who backed Brexit, will react to Starmer’s new deal with the EU.

Russiatargeted Ukraine with its largest single drone attack yet just hours ahead of President Donald Trump’s phone call with Vladimir Putin about ending the war. Russia on Sunday fired a total of 273 exploding drones and decoys targetingUkraine'sKyiv, Dnipropetrovsk and Donetsk regions, according to Ukraine’s air force. Of those, 88 were intercepted and 128 lost, likely being electronically jammed. The barrage was the biggest drone attack since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, Yuriy Ihnat, head of the air force's communications department, told the Associated Press. It came after Trump said he would be \"speaking, by telephone, to President Vladimir Putin of Russia on Monday, at 10:00 a.m.\" regarding the war in Ukraine.

The previous largest known single drone attack from Russia against Ukraine was on the eve of the war’s third anniversary, when Russia pounded Ukraine with 267 drones. Kyiv regional Gov.

    "article_text": "\"Eventually, they'll have a nuclear weapon. And then, the discussion becomes a much different one.\" President Trump warns that the clock is ticking on a finalizing a deal with Iran. Iran’s foreign ministersaid Sunday that regardless of whether a nuclear deal is reached with the U.S., enrichment will continue. Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi addressed negotiations between Iran and the U.S. in a post on X regarding Iran’s \"peaceful nuclear program.\" In the statement, Araghchi pointed out that U.S. officials privy to the discussions are free to state whatever they want to ward off special interest groups or malign actors that set the agendas of previous administrations. \"Iran can only control what we Iranians do, and that is to avoid negotiating in public—particularly given the current dissonance we are seeing between what our U.S. interlocutors say in public and in private, and from one week to the other,\" Araghchi said. \"Our stance on Iran's rights as a [Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty] member is crystal clear, and there is no scenario in which Iranians will permit deviance from that. TRUMP SAYS US HAS GIVEN IRAN PROPOSAL FOR NUCLEAR DEAL \"Mastering enrichment technology is a hard-earned and homegrown scientific achievement; an outcome of great sacrifice of both blood and treasure,\" he continued. \"If the U.S. is interested in ensuring that Iran will not have nuclear weapons, a deal is within reach, and we are ready for a serious conversation to achieve a solution that will forever ensure that outcome. Enrichment in Iran, however, will continue with or without a deal.\" The statement comes just days after PresidentDonald Trumpannounced on Friday that the U.S. had given Iran a proposal for a nuclear deal.

The International Atomic Energy Agency, often referred to as the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, noted in a March report that Iran’s stockpile of 60% enriched uranium had alarmingly grown from 182 kg to 275 kg, approximately 401 pounds to 606 pounds, in early 2025. \"Once you're at 60, you're 90% of the way there.

    "article_text": "Newly released audio from President Biden’s interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur reveals him struggling to recall key dates in his life—highlighting significant memory lapses. White House’s visitor logs reveal that many of the topDemocratic leaderswho most vocally defended former President Joe Biden’s leadership capabilities were frequent White House visitors and were thus presumably aware ofBiden’s worsening cognitive decline. National Republican Congressional Committee spokesperson Mike Marinella slammed Democratic leadership for participating in what he called a \"cover-up\" and the \"political scandal of the century.\" This comes as the 82-year-old former president's condition is once again making headlines, courtesy ofexcerpts from a new bookbeing released this week, \"Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again,\" which offers claims of a White House cover-up of the then-president's apparent cognitive decline. Additionally, last week's leaked audio of Biden’s 2023 interview with special counsel Robert Hur, in which the then-president appears to suffer memory lapses, is also fueling the conversation. DEMS FACE A LITMUS TEST OVER BIDEN'S COGNITIVE ABILITIES White House’s visitor logs reveal that many of the top Democratic leaders who most vocally defended former President Joe Biden’s leadership capabilities were frequent White House visitors and were thus presumably aware of Biden’s worsening cognitive decline.(Getty Images) Hur, who investigated whether Biden years earlier had improperly stored classified documents, made major headlines early last year when he decided not to charge Biden but described the then-president as an \"elderly man with a poor memory.\" Visitor logs reveal that four top Democrats made a total of 63 visits to the BidenWhite Housebetween 2022 and 2024. House Minority LeaderHakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., made 21 visits to the White House in the span of just two years, 2022 through 2024, according to official visitor logs. This means that Jeffries would presumably have been very familiar with the former president’s condition. Despite these visits, Jeffries continued to assert that he was confident in Biden’s leadership, even saying in a 2023 interview that based on firsthand knowledge of the former president \"in a high stakes circumstance,\" Biden was an \"incredible leader, incredible negotiator, incredible strategist, and he's strong, brilliant, understands nuance.\" TRUMP WISHES BIDEN 'FAST AND SUCCESSFUL RECOVERY' AFTER PROSTATE CANCER DIAGNOSIS Former President Joe Biden shared an image of he and his wife Jill on Monday after it was announced he was diagnosed with prostate cancer.(@JoeBiden/X) Again, Jeffries claimed that Biden was \"one of the most accomplished American presidents in our history, and he has the vision, I believe, the ability, the capacity and the track record to make a case to the American people that will result in us being successful in November.\" Jeffries insisted as late as February that Biden was \"the strongest candidate to defeatDonald Trump.\" The last several documented visits Jeffries made were shortly before Biden’s disastrous debate with President Donald Trump. Biden’s shockingly poor performance at this debate led to calls for him to step down, ultimately leading to his dropping out of the 2024 presidential race. In addition to Jeffries, several other top Democrats were also frequent White House visitors, including House Democratic Whip Katherine Clark, D-Mass., as well as Reps. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., and Suzan DelBene, D-Wash. Amid the Democratic turmoil in the wake of Biden’s poor debate performance, DelBene, who made five visits to the White House between 2022 and 2024, expressed continued support for Biden, saying: \"The stakes are incredibly high this election, for all of us.

Senate Minority LeaderChuck Schumerwas ripped on social media over the weekend for suggesting President Donald Trump was partially to blame for a Mexican Navy ship losing control and crashing into the Brooklyn Bridge. \"After being fully briefed on last night’s Brooklyn Bridge accident, one thing is predominantly clear: there are more questions than answers as it relates to exactly how this accident occurred,\" Schumer said in a press release after a 150-foot-tall Mexican Navy training ship, Cuauhtémoc, reportedly experienced a mechanical issue before its masts crashed into the Brooklyn Bridge,killing two cadetson the ship. \"Bridges serve as critical transportation arteries for commerce, emergency response, and daily travel, and many span key waterways that are vulnerable to both natural and man-made threats. The Coast Guard plays a crucial role in monitoring and securing these areas, deterring potential terrorist attacks, preventing illegal activities, and responding quickly to emergencies,\" Schumer wrote. \"At the same time, maintaining the structural integrity and safety of America’s bridges is critical to the economy and the well-being of communities. A failure or attack on a major bridge could disrupt supply chains, endanger lives, and cause massive economic losses. It is unacceptable that the Trump administration is potentially jeopardizing our national and economic security – as well as American lives.\" Schumer went on to point to the DOGE-implemented hiring freeze at the Coast Guard, arguing it could have impeded the Coast Guard's Vehicle Traffic System, which works in a similar fashion to the air traffic control system.

    "article_text": "Former FBI special agent Nicole Parker joins 'Fox News Live' to discuss President Donald Trump's legal fight with federal judges over deportation flights and attackers targeting Tesla owners and dealerships in protest of Elon Musk. PresidentDonald Trumpis considering Justice Department official Emil Bove, his former defense attorney, for a U.S. appeals court vacancy — a controversial nomination that would come as he continues to attack so-called \"activist\" judges for blocking his agenda. Bove, 44, is among those Trump is considering for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which covers Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware. There are currently two vacancies on the court — increasing the odds that Bove's name could be floated by Trump. If confirmed, he would serve a lifetime appointment on thefederal bench. Bove's name is not the only one being considered, familiar sources say, and conversations are believed to be in the early stages. JUDGE ON WARPATH PRESSES TRUMP DOJ ON ABREGO GARCIA DEPORTATION, ANSWERS LEAVE COURTROOM IN STUNNED SILENCE Former U.S. President Donald Trump, flanked by Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, arrives for his criminal trial at the Manhattan Criminal Court in New York on Wednesday, May 29, 2024.(Jabin Botsford/Pool via Reuters) Prior to his installation at the Justice Department, Bove spent nearly 10 years as a U.S. prosecutor for the Southern District of New York. He also defended Trump in two of his criminal trials following his first term in the White House. In each of these roles and at DOJ, Bove's hard-charging tactics have solidified his reputation as a fierce, loyal and, at times, aggressive leader. At the Justice Department, Bove has emerged as the man behind some of the administration's most contentious actions — prompting some officials to resign rather than carry out his marching orders. Shortly after taking office, he sent a memo threatening state and city officials with criminal charges or civil penalties if they failed to comply with the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration or slow-walked their orders on enforcement. \"Federal law prohibits state and local actors from resisting, obstructing and otherwise failing to comply with lawful immigration-related commands,\" Bove said in the memo.

The Senate confirmed Bondi as Attorney General with a 54-46 vote on Tuesday.(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) It was Bove whoordered federal prosecutorsfor the Southern District of New York to file a motion to dismiss charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. That order prompted a string of resignations from personnel, including acting U.S attorney for the section Danielle Sassoon to leave DOJ rather than drop the case. Bove, along with Edward Sullivan from the Justice Department's Public Integrity Section, eventually signed on to the motion themselves. Fox News also reported earlier this year thatBove was behindan exhaustive questionnaire sent to FBI agents detailing their roles in the Jan. 6 investigations. Questions ranged from agents' participation in any grand jury subpoenas to whether the agents worked or responded to leads from another FBI field office or if they worked as a case agent for investigations. FBI AGENTS GROUP TELLS CONGRESS TO TAKE URGENT ACTION TO PROTECT AGAINST POLITICIZATION Former President Donald Trump’s attorneys (L-R) Todd Blanche, Emil Bove and John Lauro depart federal court after a hearing on Trump’s election interference case on September 5, 2024 in Washington, DC.(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) FormerJustice Departmentofficials have cited concerns that the probe or any retaliatory measures carried out as a result could have a chilling effect on the work of the FBI, including its more than 52 separate field offices. The group cited in particular the order from acting then-Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove to terminate the entire FBI senior leadership team and the assistant director in charge of the Washington Field Office. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Bove would face a highly uncertain path to confirmation if nominated.

    "title": "GOP lawmaker rallies around Trump's tax-cut campaign as competitive 2026 House race looms: 'Big issue'",
    "article_text": "Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, R-Penn., campaigned with Americans for Prosperity (AFP) on Saturday to extend President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts as a key component of his \"big, beautiful bill.\" BETHLEHEM, PA– Freshman GOP Rep. Ryan Mackenzie flipped a congressional seatin the Lehigh Valleyjust six months ago, but with competitive midterm elections expected in 2026, Americans for Prosperity (AFP) is already building its grassroots coalition in his swing district. It's an off-election year for Mackenzie, who unseated longtime Democrat Rep. Susan Wild in November, but as the 42-year-old jogged through neighborhood blocks in Bethlehem and greeted constituents at their doors on Saturday afternoon, the newest Pennsylvania congressman still has 17 months before his first re-election challenge. Mackenzie joined AFP activists in the Lehigh Valley on Saturday for a day of action, designed to educate constituents on his work to extend PresidentDonald Trump's2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and pass Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" as budget negotiations continue back on Capitol Hill. He said it was his first time door knocking since winning in November. \"We have a tremendous opportunity as members of Congress to actually pass transformative legislation which will bring down taxes and the cost of living for not only individuals, but small businesses all across this country. For the past four years, we've seen that inflation has been out of control, driving up the prices of everything — food, fuel, housing, healthcare,\" Mackenzie told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview. GOP REPS, ADVOCACY GROUP TO TARGET COMPETITIVE HOUSE DISTRICTS IN TRUMP TAX-CUT PUSH Rep. Ryan Mackenzie joined a day of action hosted by Americans for Prosperity (AFP) on Saturday.(Deirdre Heavey/Fox News Digital) \"It's been very difficult for people to make ends meet. That was a big issue in the campaign, and now we have that opportunity to deliver, as members of Congress, with significant tax reform and tax relief,\" Mackenzie added. CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS TARGETING DOZENS OF HOUSE REPUBLICAN-HELD SEATS IN 2026 MIDTERM BATTLE FOR MAJORITY Conservative holdouts stalled a procedural vote for reconciliation on Friday, prompting House leaders to return to the Hill late Sunday night to continue negotiations. Meanwhile, Trump is urging House Republicans to pass his \"big, beautiful bill\" following his high-profile diplomatic trip to theMiddle Eastlast week. Mackenzie greets a supporter in his garage in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.(Deirdre Heavey/Fox News Digital) \"Ultimately, we do have to get a resolution that satisfies 218 members of Congress. We're very close to doing that, and this is all part of the process. Nobody should be upset or concerned about any kind of little bumps in the road, because ultimately, we're going to come together to do what's right for the American people,\" Mackenzie said. The conservative advocacy group teamed up with GOP Reps. David Schweikert and Juan Ciscomani of Arizona,Ashley Hinson of Iowa, Tom Barrett of Michigan and Mackenzie of Pennsylvania for door-knocking, phone banks and grassroots organizing in a show of support for Trump's tax cuts this weekend — telling constituents how their representatives are working to alleviate financial burden for everyday Americans. Mackenzie takes a selfie with an AFP activist as they knock on doors in the Lehigh Valley.(Deirdre Heavey/Fox News Digital) AFP shared with Fox News Digital that they reached over 90,000 voters on Saturday. \"Americans for Prosperity Pennsylvania has been on the ground knocking doors, making calls, hosting events, and organizing demonstrations to educate and show the urgency for Congress to make provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent,\" Emily Greene, Americans for Prosperity Pennsylvania State Director, told Fox News Digital. Mackenzie greets supporters at Valley Family Restaurant in Bethlehem ahead of door knocking.(Deirdre Heavey/Fox News Digital) \"We’re talking with taxpayers and business owners every day who understand that Congress needs to get to work — we can’t risk facing the largest tax hike in American history. After four years of record-high inflation, taxpayers deserve better.\" AFP launched the day of action in conjunction with a $20 million \"Protect Prosperity\" campaign, which the advocacy group called the single largest investment of any outside group dedicated to preserving the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. AFP passed out pamphlets to Mackenzie's constituents on Saturday about Trump's 2017 tax cuts.(Deirdre Heavey/Fox News Digital) And it's no coincidence that AFP focused its attention on competitive congressional districts in Arizona, Iowa, Michigan and Pennsylvania this weekend, as contentious races are expected in 2026. While Saturday's day of action was designed to spotlight how Republican representatives are working in Washington, D.C., to boost the economy for everyday Americans back home, it also launched an early messaging campaign. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As Democrats try to win back control in the House of Representatives in 2026, AFP is getting ahead of Democrats' likely attacks on vulnerable Republicans' support for Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" — by telling Republican voters that their representatives are delivering for them.

    "title": "Conservative rips blue state Republican's proposal to raise taxes on wealthy in SALT debate",
    "article_text": "Fox News' Madeleine Rivera reports the latest on Republicans' effort to advance President Donald Trump's agenda. EXCLUSIVE:A conservative Republican said he's opposed to his moderate colleague's proposal for a modest tax hike on high-income earners, as GOP lawmakers continue to navigate divisions over PresidentDonald Trump's\"one big, beautiful bill.\" \"Well, think about that — higher taxes to pay for something that is pretty much self-inflicted by all the states that don't have their financials in order,\" Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told Fox News Digital on Sunday. It comes as various House Republican factions are locked in high-stakes debates on taxes, Medicaid, and green energy subsidies while crafting Trump's wide-ranging bill. Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y., suggested over the weekend that increasing the top tax bracket to a 39.6% income tax rate rather than 37% could help pay for higher deduction caps for state and local taxes (SALT). TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' PASSES KEY HOUSE HURDLE AFTER GOP REBEL MUTINY Rep. Ralph Norman pushed back on a proposal for a modest tax increase to pay for a higher SALT deduction cap, floated by Rep. Nick LaLota.(Getty Images) The 39.6% rate refers to the top income tax bracket before it was lowered by Trump’s 2017Tax Cuts and Jobs Act(TCJA). SALT deduction caps primarily benefit people living in high-cost-of-living areas like New York City, Los Angeles, and their surrounding suburbs. Republicans representing those areas, including LaLota, have argued that raising the SALT deduction cap is an existential issue — and that a failure to address it could cost the GOP the House majority in the 2026 midterms. Several of the Republicans vying for higher SALT deduction caps have pointed out that their victories are critical to the party retaining control of the House in 2024. SALT deduction caps did not exist before TCJA, which notably instilled a $10,000 ceiling for married and single tax filers. \"The One Big Beautiful Bill has stalled—and it needs wind in its sails. Allowing the top tax rate to expire—returning from 37% to 39.6% for individuals earning over $609,350 and married couples earning over $731,200—breathes $300 billion of new life into the effort,\" LaLota wrote on X. \"It’s a fiscally responsible move that reflects the priorities of the new Republican Party: protect working families, address the deficit, fix the unfair SALT cap, and safeguard programslike Medicaidand SNAP—without raising taxes on the middle class.\" But Republicans in lower-tax states are largely wary of significant increases to those caps, believing them to incentivize blue states' high-tax policies. It's one of several differences Republicans are working to reconcile over President Donald Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\"(Mark Schiefelbein/AP Photo) \"People with money invest, and to tax them more — history has been, when you tax the other upper 1% more, you know, the economy does worse,\" Norman argued. \"More taxes don't make sense to me.\" The current legislation would increase the SALT deduction cap from $10,000 to $30,000, but a majority of Republicans in the House SALT Caucus rejected the deal. LaLota and others have contended it's not enough for middle-class families in their districts. \"My party’s $30K cap proposal only makes 4 in 5 households whole. That’s not enough. On [Long Island], $250K isn’t rich—it barely covers the basics. Too many families pay over $15K in property taxes & get left out. I’m fighting for a higher cap. Wish me luck,\" he said on X. But while tax hike proposals targeting wealthy Americans were part of Republicans' negotiations at an earlier point, any such effort appears to have beenall but definitively stamped out. House GOP leadership aides signaled to reporters on Monday morning that such a tax hike would not be in the final bill, pointing to Speaker Mike Johnson's comments on the matter. Johnson, R-La., said on The Will Cain Show late last month that he was \"not in favor of raising the tax rates, because our party is the group that stands against that, traditionally.\" HOUSE GOP TARGETS ANOTHER DEM OFFICIAL ACCUSED OF BLOCKING ICE AMID DELANEY HALL FALLOUT But nevertheless, the differing viewpoints underscore the divisions that Republicans still have to navigate ahead of their planned House-wide vote on Trump's bill later this week. Republicans are using the budget reconciliation process to advance Trump's priorities on taxes, immigration, energy, defense and the national debt via one massive bill. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Budget reconciliation lowers the Senate’s threshold for passage from 60 votes to 51, thereby allowing the party in power to skirt the minority — in this case, Democrats — to pass sweeping pieces of legislation, provided they deal with the federal budget, taxation or the national debt.

It’s normally an hour-long session behind closed doors in which Republicans discuss the week’s agenda and any outstanding issues. The president is expected to rally Republicans around the massive piece of legislation designed to advance his agenda on tax, immigration, defense, energy, and raising the debt limit. It’s a significant escalation in the president’s involvement in the process so far. TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' PASSES KEY HOUSE HURDLE AFTER GOP REBEL MUTINY President Donald Trump will be on Capitol Hill on Tuesday morning(Getty Images/AP Images) House Republicans, meanwhile, have several critical differences to resolve before their self-imposed deadline to pass the bill by Memorial Day. Conservatives are pushing for the bill to be more aggressive on cutting waste, fraud, and abuse in the Medicaid system, including a faster timeline for implementing work requirements for able-bodied recipients. Currently, the legislation has work requirements kicking in 2029. Moderates, meanwhile, have been wary of making significant cuts to the program. Fiscal hawks are also pushing for a total and near-immediate repeal of the former Biden administration’s green energy subsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), noting it was a Trump campaign promise — while other Republicans have pointed out businesses in their districts are benefiting from the tax relief.

GOP lawmakers in lower-tax states have dismissed it as a giveaway to high-tax Democrat-controlled areas, however. News of Trump’s likely appearance on Capitol Hill comes after Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said on a lawmaker-only call on Monday morning that the president is ready and willing to play an active role in discussions. \"He wants to be involved as much as we need him,\" Johnson told House GOP colleagues.

    "article_text": "Gatestone Institute senior fellow Gordon Chang dissects President Donald Trump's relations with China and the Chinese economy on 'Life, Liberty & Levin.' The reported discovery of \"rogue communication devices\" in Chinese-exported solar inverters spurred new scrutiny of Chinese imports and of the security of the domestic electric grid. In a blue state known for backing solar and othergreen energy alternatives, a top state Republican warned that \"the time to act is now\" to stop incursions by a malign foreign actor. \"The recent discovery of rogue communication devices underscores a chilling reality: our critical infrastructure is vulnerable, and New Jersey’s leadership is asleep at the wheel,\" said state Sen. Doug Steinhardt, R-Belvidere. Steinhardt, a former chair of the state GOP, said allowing \"hostile foreign governments\" to potentially penetrateU.S. energynetworks is a national security writ large. TRUMP ENERGY CHIEF RECOUNTS EVOLUTION OF US ENVIRONS OVER 56 EARTH DAYS: A HANDILY-ENERGIZED SOCIETY WORKS In New Jersey’s case, three bills – all sponsored by Steinhardt – seek to blunt this new threat, including one banning the state from companies owned by or based out of certain foreign countries. Another bill in the Garden State would somewhat mirror Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ policy against Chinese land ownership near protected facilities. Such policies also grew out of CCP-linked purchases of land in the Sunshine State and across the country, including another controversial 380,000-acre purchase in North Dakota near the Grand Forks Air Force Base. A Reuters reportlast week discovered solar power inverters were found to have \"rogue communication devices not listed in product documents\" within the modules after being \"stripped-down\" by technologists. Inverters, of which a majority are imported, connect solar panels and wind installations to electric grids by converting DC power to AC power. While solar tech does typically have firewalls against outside incursion, the findings raised concern, according to Reuters.

Citing national security concerns, a bipartisan pair of senators introduced the Decoupling from Foreign Adversarial Battery Dependence Act, which would prohibit the government from buying batteries from some foreign sources over similar concerns. \"Our national security should not require reliance on components made by adversaries like China,\" Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., said in drafting the bill with Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla. \"This bipartisan legislation will help safeguard both our supply chains and our national security by preventing the Department of Homeland Security from purchasing Chinese batteries for the devices and technology that keep Americans safe.\" In comments to Fox News Digital on Monday, Scott called it \"terrifying\" the CCP could have any control over the U.S. grid.

    "article_text": "Gatestone Institute senior fellow Gordon Chang dissects President Donald Trump's relations with China and the Chinese economy on 'Life, Liberty & Levin.' Harvard University is facing demands from key House Republicans to explain allegations it trained members of a Chinese paramilitary group and worked withIran-linked researchers. In a letter sent this week, Reps. John Moolenaar, R-Mich., chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party; Tim Walberg, R-Mich., chairman of the Education and the Workforce Committee; and Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., requested internal documents and communications from Harvard officials detailing the university’s partnerships with foreign adversaries. The lawmakers raised alarm over Harvard’s repeated hosting and training of members of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC) — a paramilitary organization sanctioned by the U.S. government for its role in the Chinese Communist Party’s genocide against Uyghur Muslims. According to the letter, Harvard allegedly usedDepartment of Defensefunding to partner with Chinese universities on research with potential military applications.

Harvard’s China Health Partnership reportedly hosted healthcare policy training sessions that included XPCC officials, a fact highlighted byChinese government outlets. \"We are deeply concerned the services and resources provided through these events may violate U.S. law and could have been deployed by XPCC to further repress the Uyghur people and other ethnic minorities in China,\" the lawmakers wrote.

In another, a Harvard researcher partnered with a Zhejiang University professor on polymer science research funded by the U.S. Air Force, which could be applied to aircraft construction. A third project involved shape memory alloys, materials with aerospace applications, researched alongside faculty from Huazhong University, also under Air Force funding. \"Harvard researchers should not be contributing to the military capabilities of a potential adversary,\" the letter stated. The lawmakers also noted that Harvard researchers have routinely worked with Chinese military-linked institutions on dual-use technologies, including microelectronics, AI, and quantum science. Additionally, the lawmakers raised concerns over Harvard’s organ transplant research involving China-based collaborators, citing growing international scrutiny of China’s forced organ harvesting practices. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Harvard trained members of a sanctioned Chinese paramilitary group responsible for genocide, and its researchers partnered with Chinese military universities on DoD-funded research and worked with researchers funded by the Iranian regime,\" said Moolenaar. \"These are not isolated incidents — they represent a disturbing pattern that puts U.S. national security at risk.

    "title": "Trump hails cooperative effort at anti-revenge porn bill signing: 'Bipartisanship is still possible'",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump speak about the 'Take It Down' Act live from the White House. PresidentDonald Trumpsaid the cooperation he witnessed to get theTake It Down Actinto law was one of the greatest moments of bipartisanship he has seen. The president signed the bill, which punishes internet abuse involving nonconsensual, explicit imagery, during an outdoors ceremony in the White House Rose Garden Monday afternoon, joined by first ladyMelania Trump, who has been championing the issue since her husband's inauguration. \"This legislation is a powerful step forward in our efforts to ensure that every American, especially young people, can feel better protected from their image or identity being abused through non-consensual, or intimate imagery of NCII,\" the first lady said from the rose garden Monday afternoon. \"Artificial intelligence and social media at a digital candy for the next generation,\" she added. \"Sweet, addictive and engineered to have an impact on the cognitive development of our children. But unlike sugar, these new technologies can be weaponized to shape beliefs, and sadly affect emotions and even be deadly.\" President Donald Trump invited First Lady Melania Trump to also sign thenew anti-revenge porn act that she helped usher through to the finish line during a signing ceremony at the White House's rose garden Monday afternoon.(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Trump reiterated the importance of the new legislation during the signing ceremony Monday afternoon from the White House. He also touted \"a level of bipartisanship\" he's never seen before to get the legislation across the finish line, citing the work of the first lady as a big catalyst. \"We've shown that bipartisanship is possible,\" Trump said shortly before he signed the new act. \"I mean, it's the first time I've seen such a level of bipartisanship, but it's a beautiful thing to do. I'm not even sure you realize, honey, you know, a lot of the Democrats and Republicans don't get along so well. You've made them get along, and she didn't even know about that. She didn't know we had a problem. She didn't know we had a problem. She got it. TheTake It Down Actis a bill introduced in the Senate by Sens.Ted Cruz,R-Texas, and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., that would make it a federal crime to publish, or threaten to publish, nonconsensual intimate imagery, including \"digital forgeries\" crafted by artificial intelligence. The bill unanimously passed the Senate in February, and passed in the House of Representatives in April with a vote of 409–2. MELANIA TRUMP SPEAKS ON CAPITOL HILL FOR FIRST TIME IN ROUNDTABLE FOCUSED ON PUNISHING REVENGE PORN The law would require penalties of up to three years in prison for sharing nonconsensual intimate images — authentic or AI-generated — involving minors and two years in prison for those images involving adults. It also would require penalties of up to two and a half years in prison for threat offenses involving minors, and one and a half years in prison for threats involving adults.

AI-generated imagesknown as \"deepfakes\" often involve editing videos or photos of people to make them look like someone else by using artificial intelligence. Deepfakes hit the public’s radar in 2017 after a Reddit user posted realistic-looking pornography of celebrities to the platform, opening the floodgates to users employing AI to make images look more convincing and widely shared in the following years. Right now, nearly every U.S. state has a law protecting people from nonconsensual intimate image violations, but the laws vary in classification of crime and penalty. In March, the first lady spoke on Capitol Hill for the first time since returning to the White House to participate in a roundtable with lawmakers and victims of revenge porn and AI-generated deepfakes. The first lady invited 15-year-old Elliston Berry, whose high school peers used AI to create nonconsensual imagery of her and spread them across social media. U.S. first lady Melania Trump speaks during a roundtable discussion on the \"Take It Down Act\" in the Mike Mansfield Room at the U.S. Capitol on March 03, 2025 in Washington, D.C.(Getty Images) \"It’s heartbreaking to witness young teens, especially girls, grappling with the overwhelming challenges posed by malicious online content, like deepfakes,\" Trump said. \"This toxic environment can be severely damaging. We must prioritize their well-being by equipping them with the support and tools necessary to navigate this hostile digital landscape. Every young person deserves a safe online space to express themselves freely, without the looming threat of exploitation or harm.\" REVENGE PORN BILL BACKED BY MELANIA TRUMP HEADS TO PRESIDENT'S DESK AFTER OVERWHELMING HOUSE VOTE Berry, a Texas native, told the roundtable she was just 14 years old when she realized in 2023 that\"a past Instagram photo with a nude body and my face attached made from AI,\" was circulating on social media. \"Fear, shock and disgust were just some of the many emotions I felt,\" Berry said. \"I felt responsible and began to blame myself and was ashamed to tell my parents. Despite doing nothing wrong. As I attended school, I was scared of the reactions of someone or someone could recreate these photos.\" \"We need to hold big tech accountable to take action,\" the young woman continued. \"I came here today to not only promote this bill, but to fight for the freedom of so many survivors, millions of people, male, female, teenage children, kids all are affected by the rise of this image-based sexual abuse. This is unacceptable. The Take It Down act will give a voice to the victims and provide justice.\" Another young girl, Francesca Mani of New Jersey, recounted that she also was just 14 when she and other peers found deepfake images on themselves online. \"Teenagers might not know all the laws, but they do know when something is wrong,\" Mani said. \"Schools need to take immediate, serious action to ensure that AI exploitation, harassment and deepfake abuse are met with real consequences.\" First Lady of the U.S. Melania Trump reacts on the day of U.S. President Donald Trump's speech to a joint session of Congress, in the House Chamber of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., U.S., March 4, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters The first lady invited the young women as her special guests for Trump’s first address to a joint session of Congress in March. Sharing nonconsensual and AI-generated explicit images on social media and the internet has not just affected young girls, as young boys and adults also face similar crimes. A woman named Breeze Liu told the roundtable that she worked tirelessly to remove AI-generated images of herself that landed on a pornography site in 2020 when she was 24 years old. And Republican South Carolina state Rep. Brandon Guffey also joined the group of lawmakers and the first lady in March, recounting how his 17-year-old son committed suicide in 2022 after he was caught up in a sextortion scam. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"I lost my oldest son, Gavin Guffey, to suicide,\" he shared. \"We quickly found out that he was being extorted online. That someone pretending to be a young female at another college requested images to be shared back and forth. And as soon as he shared those images, he took his life. It was an hour and 40 minutes from the time that he was contacted until the time that he took his life.\" Meanwhile, during the first Trump administration, Melania Trump hosted virtual roundtables on foster care as part of her \"Be Best\" initiative and focused on strengthening the child welfare system. The \"Be Best\" initiative also focused on online safety. \"As first lady, my commitment to the ‘Be Best’ initiative underscores the importance of online safety,\" she said. \"In an era where digital interactions are integral to daily life, it is imperative that we safeguard children from mean-spirited and hurtful online behavior.\" The first lady, in March, said the bill \"represents a powerful step toward justice, healing and unity.\"",

EXCLUSIVE: United States Attorney for the District of California Bill Essayli is taking major action to crack down on \"sanctuary\" policies in theGolden State. He’s launching \"Operation Guardian Angel,\" which is a task force, made up of assets from ICE, HSI, DEA, FBI, ATF, andBorder Patrol, to begin scanning a criminal database every single day to identify arrested illegal aliens in local jurisdictions that DOJ can charge with felony illegal-reentry. \"They've made it almost impossible for ICE to do their job, issue detainers and get criminal illegal immigrants out of jails.

And if they meet the elements of illegal reentry, which is a federal crime, we are filing a complaint and getting an arrest warrant issued before they're released from state custody.\" Essayli said that the first-of-its-kind program will make the Golden State a \"testing ground\" for other sanctuary jurisdictions throughout the country, as the administration aims to get illegal aliens with criminal charges and convictions swiftly out of the United States.

    "title": "Former Freedom Caucus Chair Bob Good calls out 'the big glaring weakness for all of Republican government'",
    "article_text": "Former Rep. Bob Good gives his analysis of the current state of political affairs. Former Rep. Bob Good,a Republicanfrom Virginia who once chaired the conservative House Freedom Caucus, is sounding the alarm about America's \"fiscal crisis,\" accusing fellow Republicans of failing to focus on the critical issue and slash spending. He blamed \"all Republican leadership,\" during an interview with Fox News Digital. \"You're not hearing a lot from Republican leadership — from the White House or from the Congress — about spending cuts,\" he said. Good praised PresidentDonald Trumpon a variety of issues, crediting the president with doing a \"great job in many executive actions,\" but he described the moves as \"quick fix sugar highs\" that could easily be undone when a Democrat wins the presidency again and said that Congress has not been codifying Trump's policies into law. He said that \"the big glaring weakness for all of Republican government\" is failing to focus on the nation's debt and deficit, and to slash spending. TRUMP'S ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’ PASSES KEY HOUSE HURDLE AFTER GOP REBEL MUTINY Then-Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, attends a press conference on the government funding bill at the U.S. Capitol on March 22, 2024 in Washington, D.C.( Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) The U.S. national debt is over $36.2 trillion, according tofiscaldata.treasury.gov. President Trump and some GOP lawmakers have been seeking to push Trump's \"One, Big, Beautiful Bill\" through Congress, but other Republicans have been pressing for changes. The House Freedom Caucus issued a statement on Sunday night declaring that the measure \"does not yet meet the moment.\" \"As written, the bill continues increased deficits in the near term with possible savings years down the road that may never materialize. Thanks to discussions over the weekend, the bill will be closer to the budget resolution framework we agreed upon in the House in April, but it fails to actually honor our promise to significantly correct the spending trajectory of the federal government and lead our nation towards a balanced budget,\" the caucus board's statement reads, in part, later adding, \"We face a serious fiscal crisis, and we must put an end to Washington’s wasteful spending now.\" TRUMP'S ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’ WINS SUPPORT FROM POLICE FOR OVERTIME TAX ELIMINATION Good, a fiscal hawk who has been referring to the measure as the \"big, ugly bill,\" indicated that if Republicans do not fight now when they only need 51 votes to pass a measure in the Senate due to reconciliation, they will not do so later. He said most GOP figures, like most Democrats, are largely focused on their own political careers and will \"be even weaker\" in 2026, the year of the midterm elections. Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought has pushed back against criticism of the reconciliation bill. \"Critics have attacked the House's One Big Beautiful reconciliation bill on fiscal grounds, but I think they are profoundly wrong,\" he wrote in a part ofa poston X last week. \"The current House bill includes $1.6 trillion in savings. These are not gimmicks but real reforms that lower spending and improve the programs.\" \"So after nothing happening for decades, the House bill provides a historic $1.6 trillion in mandatory savings...with a three-seat majority. $36 trillion in debt is not solved overnight. It is solved by advancing and securing victories at a scale that over time, gives a fighting shot to addressing the problem. The House's One Big Beautiful Bill deserves passage for many reasons ... tax cuts, border security funding, eliminating the Green New Deal, work requirements to end dependency ... but it should not be lost on anyone, the degree to which it ends decades of fiscal futility and gets us winning again. It deserves the vote of every member of Congress,\" he asserted. ‘TOO LATE’: TRUMP BACKS CHALLENGER TO FREEDOM CAUCUS CHAIR DESPITE RECEIVING PRIOR ENDORSEMENT Good, who served in Congress from early 2021 until early 2025,lost a 2024 congressional GOP primary contestto a Trump-backed challenger. Trump repeatedly attacked Good in the lead up to the 2024 primary contest,asserting on Truth Socialthat \"Bob Good is BAD FOR VIRGINIA, AND BAD FOR THE USA.\" Good ultimatelylost the primaryby less than 1% of the vote. He had endorsed Florida Gov.Ron DeSantisfor president in 2023 before the governor launched his White House bid that year. In 2024, Good endorsed Trump immediately after DeSantis dropped out. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In hisendorsement post, Good called Trump \"the greatest President of my lifetime,\" adding, \"we need him to reinstate the policies that were working so well for America.\" Good expressed interest in the prospect of potentially running for office again, telling Fox News Digital that he is keeping his \"options open\" and praying about it, but has not arrived at a decision yet.

    "title": "New projection signals good news for families, workers in Trump's 'big, beautiful bill'",
    "article_text": "Fox News' Madeleine Rivera reports the latest on Republicans' effort to advance President Donald Trump's agenda. FIRST ON FOX:A key U.S. economic agency is projecting that PresidentDonald Trump's tax policy in his \"one big, beautiful bill\" will lead to increased take-home pay for American families and higher wages for U.S. workers. The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), which advises the White House on economic policy, released a report on Monday morning that said, \"Taken as a whole, the CEA estimates that the tax cuts in the President’s proposals and the One Big Beautiful Bill will substantially boost investment and GDP relative to if expiring provisions from the [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act] are not extended.\" Congressional Republicans are working to permanently extend Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), as well as implement a list of new, shorter-term Trump tax policies, like eliminating penalties on tipped and overtime wages, while granting seniors an added tax deduction. Republican leaders have warned that failure to extend TCJA could lead to a tax increase of up to 22% for millions of families. MEET THE TRUMP-PICKED LAWMAKERS GIVING SPEAKER JOHNSON A FULL HOUSE GOP CONFERENCE Republicans are working on President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill.(Getty) However, extending them could lead to more money in people’s pockets in the long run, the CEA said. \"For workers and families, the CEA forecasts that wages will be about $6,100 to $11,600 higher, with family take-home pay $7,800 to $13,300 higher because of the increase in wages and reduction in tax obligations,\" the new analysis said. The CEA said the added deductionfor seniors,meanwhile, would increase the average take-home pay for qualifying seniors by approximately $400 to $450 per year. If passed, the policies would also boost U.S. investment in the long run from 4.9% to 7.5%, according to the projection, and could save or create as many as 4.2 million full-time equivalent jobs in the long run. It also estimated that Trump’s \"no tax on tips\" proposal alone would increase tipped workers’ pay by an average $1,675 per year, while eliminating the tax on overtime wages \"will cause overtime workers to increase their overtime hours by 4.7 percent, leading to a 0.2 percent increase in aggregate labor supply while the provision is in effect.\" \"As a result, the level of GDP increases by 0.1 to 0.2 percent in the short run. The average overtime worker receives a tax cut of between $1,400 and $1,750 per year,\" the projection said. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is ushering the bill through the House of Representatives.(AP Photo/Rod Lamkey, Jr., File) White House press secretaryKaroline Leavittsaid during a Monday morning briefing, \"This bill will give Americans the largest tax cuts in our nation's history. When Republicans pass the bill, Americans will be keeping more of their hard-earned money and taking home much bigger paychecks.\" \"If Democrats get their way and the Trump tax cuts are not extended, Americans will face the largest tax hike in history to the tune of $4 trillion. Republicans must not side with Democrats in helping them raise taxes,\" Leavitt added. It comes as Democrats accuse Republicans of trying to gut critical programs like Medicaid and Social Security to secure tax increases for wealthy Americans. They have pointed to projections like those by the Joint Committee on Taxation, which said people making less than $50,000 per year would get $263 in tax relief, and those making over $1 million would get more than $81,000. ANTI-ABORTION PROVIDER MEASURE IN TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' COULD SPARK HOUSE GOP REBELLION However, Republicans have argued they are focused on aiding the working and middle classes with Trump’s tax bill – while not raising taxes on any Americans. Rep. Mike Haridopolos, R-Fla., also pointed out last week that the Republicans’ bill does not touch the top income tax bracket. \"I kept hearing this idea that we’re cutting taxes on the rich,\" Haridopolos said, referring to conversations by his Democratic colleagues on the House floor last week. \"The current rate is 37%. Under our new proposed bill, it’s still 37%. We’re keeping that rate static, we’re not cutting taxes for the rich. What we need to do, of course, is invest in the people again – the best way you do that is offer tax relief.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt listens during a briefing with reporters in the James Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House on Friday, May 9 in Washington, D.C.(AP/Alex Brandon) Republicans areworking to passTrump’s policies on tax, immigration, energy, defense, and the national debt all in one massive bill via the budget reconciliation process. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Budget reconciliation lowers the Senate’s threshold for passage from 60 votes to 51, thereby allowing the party in power to skirt the minority – in this case, Democrats – to pass sweeping pieces of legislation, provided they deal with the federal budget, taxation, or the national debt. House Republicans are hoping to advance Trump’s bill through the House by the end of this week, with a goal of a final bill on the president’s desk by Fourth of July.

    "article_text": "Former Arizona Supreme Court Judge Andrew Gould discusses the U.S. Supreme Court blocking the Trump administration's deportations of suspected Venezuelan gang members under the Alien Enemies Act on 'Fox Report.' TheSupreme Courton Monday agreed to lift a lower court injunction that blocked President Donald Trump's decision to terminate the protected legal status of hundreds of thousands of migrants living in the U.S., in a win for the administration as it looks to deliver on its hard-line immigration enforcement policies. The decision clears the way for the Trump administration to move forward with its plans to terminate Biden-era Temporary Protected Status (TPS) protections for roughly 300,000Venezuelan migrantsliving in the U.S. and allows the administration to move forward with plans to immediately remove these migrants, which lawyers for the administration argued they should be able to do. U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer argued as much when he asked the Supreme Court to lift the injunction this month, arguing in an emergency appeal that a lower court judge had overstepped their authority by blocking the administration from ending the program for certain Venezuelans. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ASKS SUPREME COURT TO REVIEW EL SALVADOR DEPORTATION FLIGHT CASE Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem(Jabin Botsford/Washington Post via Getty Images) \"The district court’s reasoning is untenable,\" Sauer told the high court, adding that the program \"implicates particularly discretionary, sensitive, and foreign-policy-laden judgments of the Executive Branch regarding immigration policy.\" At issue was the TPS program, which allows people from certain countries to live and work in the U.S. legally if they cannot work safely in their home country due to a disaster, armed conflict or other \"extraordinary and temporary conditions.\" MAGA GROUP FIGHTS TO UNDO CARTER-ERA BAN ON MERIT-BASED FEDERAL HIRING Trump's administration seeks to end protected status for certain migrants.(Getty Images) The protections were extended during the end of the Biden administration, shortly before Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February abruptly terminated the program for a specific group of Venezuelan nationals, arguing they were not in the national interest. In March,U.S. District Judge Edward Chenof the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California agreed to keep the protections in place, siding with plaintiffs from the National TPS Alliance in ruling that the termination of the TPS program, which is extended in 18-month increments, is \"unprecedented\" and suggested that the abrupt termination may have been \"predicated on negative stereotypes\" about Venezuelan migrants. U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call via Getty Images) Sauer disputed this in the appeal to the Supreme Court. In it, he also accused the lower court judge of improperly intruding on the executive branch’s authority over immigration policy. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Forceful condemnations of gang violence and broad questioning of the integrity of the prior administration’s immigration practices, including potential abuses of the TPS program, do not evince discriminatory intent,\" Sauer said, describing Chen's descriptions as \"cherry-picked\" and \"wrongly portrayed\" as \"racially tinged.\" Fox News's Shannon Bream and Bill Mears contributed to this report.

    "article_text": "Dr. Nicole Saphier and 'The Big Weekend Show' panelists discuss former President Joe Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis. Joe Bidenhas been diagnosed with an \"aggressive form\" of prostate cancer. Biden’s team shared a statement on Sunday that the former president was experiencing \"increasing urinary symptoms\" ahead of his diagnosis, which was characterized by a Gleason score of 9 (grade group 5) with \"metastasis to the bone.\" \"While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management. The president and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians,\" the statement said. JOE BIDEN DIAGNOSED WITH ‘AGGRESSIVE FORM’ OF PROSTATE CANCER WITH METASTASIS TO THE BONE Biden’s ranking of 9 on the Gleason scale, a grading system forprostate cancerseverity, has sparked concerns, as it correlates with high-grade cancer. Former U.S. President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with prostate cancer at the age of 82.(Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post via Getty Images; iStock) Dr. Arpeet Shah, a urologist with Associated Urological Specialists in Illinois, explained in an interview with Fox News Digital how the grading system indicates the aggressiveness of the disease. \"It’s based on what thecancer cellslook like under a microscope – specifically, how different they look from normal prostate cells,\" he said. (Shah was not involved in Biden's care.) PROSTATE CANCER CASES SPIKE IN THIS US STATE AS DOCTORS SHARE LIKELY REASON Pathologists assign two numbers from 1 to 5, based on the most common and second-most common patterns present in the tissue. The lower the grade, the more normal the cancer cells look, according to Cleveland Clinic. Pathologists and cancer specialists examine cancerous cells in the prostate tissue to determine the Gleason score.(iStock) Descriptions of the grades are listed below. Grade 1– Cancer cells look like normal cells. Grades 2 to 4– Cancer cells in the tissue look less like normal cells. Grade 5– Cancer cells look very abnormal. For more Health articles, visitwww.foxnews.com/health The largest areas with cancer are graded and then added together to determine a Gleason score, which typically ranges from 6 to 10. \"The higher the score, the more aggressivethe canceris likely to be,\" Shah said. Biden's Gleason score of 9 in grade group 5 indicates an \"aggressive\" and fast-growing cancer, experts say.(iStock) Below is a breakdown of Gleason score ranges. Gleason score of 6:Cancer is low-grade and slow-growing. Gleason score of 7:Cancer is intermediate and more likely to grow or spread over time. Gleason score of 8 to 10:Cancer is high-grade and may need moreaggressive treatment.

Saphier confirmed that Biden’s metastasized cancer is stage 4, which \"significantly\" decreases the chance of survival. \"No two cases are exactly the same,\" she said. \"But the one good thing that they did mention about President Biden’s case is that it’s hormone-sensitive.\" \"We have so many treatments these days that you can actually live for quite a long time with stage 4 cancers.\" This form can be treatable throughsurgery or medicationthat will stop the testosterone production that fuels cancer growth. \"[Stage 4] is the worst-case scenario when you're talking about cancer, but we have so many treatments these days that you can actually live for quite a long time with stage 4 cancers,\" Saphier said.

    "article_text": "Board-certified rheumatologist Dr. Mahsa Tehrani discusses President Donald Trump’s possible 25% tariff on overseas medication and a new study on the relationship between Ozempic and dementia risk on ‘America Reports.’ Weight-loss medicationsknown as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, which have gained popularity for treating type 2 diabetes and obesity, have been shown to have the surprising secondary benefit of reducing alcohol intake. A team of international researchers from Ireland and Saudi Arabia followed 262 adult patients with obesity who started taking two GLP-1 medications: liraglutide or semaglutide. Among the regular drinkers, weeklyalcohol intakedecreased by 68%, from approximately 23 units of alcohol to around 8 units. WEIGHT LOSS, DIABETES DRUGS CAN CAUSE MOOD CHANGES: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT BEHAVIORAL SIDE EFFECTS The findings were recently published in the journal Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism and were also presented last week at the European Congress on Obesity in Spain. GLP-1 agonists mimic a hormone called GLP-1, which is released from thegastrointestinal systemafter eating, according to study co-author Carel Le Roux, a professor at University College Dublin. Weight-loss medications known as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists have been shown to have the surprising secondary benefit of reducing alcohol intake.(iStock) These medications activate GLP-1 receptors in the brain, decreasing the sense of \"reward\" people feel after eating or drinking, eventually leading to reduced cravings for both food and alcohol, he told Fox News Digital. \"It is this commonality of function that suggests the GLP-1 receptors in the brain may be a therapeutic target for not just the disease of obesity, but also for alcohol use disorder,\" the professor said. Before the participants started the weight-loss drugs, they self-reported their weeklyalcohol intake, then were categorized as non-drinkers, rare drinkers or regular drinkers. Approximately 72% had at least two follow-up visits and 68% reported regular alcohol consumption. WEIGHT-LOSS DRUGS’ IMPACT ON CANCER RISK REVEALED IN NEW STUDY After starting the weight-loss medications, the participants’ weekly average alcohol intake decreased by almost two-thirds overall — from approximately 11 units of alcohol to four units after four months of treatment with the GLP-1 agonists. The reduction in alcohol use was comparable to the decrease that can be achieved by nalmefene, a drug that decreases the \"buzz\" feeling in people with alcohol use disorder in Europe, according to the researchers. Among the regular drinkers, weekly alcohol intake decreased by 68%, from approximately 23 units of alcohol to around 8 units.(iStock) For the 188 patients who were followed over an average of four months, none had increased their alcohol intake after starting theweight-loss medications. Patients reported that after an evening meal, they were too full to have their usual drink — and when they did drink, they reported becoming full extremely quickly and drinking at a slower pace, Le Roux noted. \"The findings in this study suggest that we may have just found a therapeutic target for alcohol use disorder.\" This suggests that the experience was less enjoyable, partly due to the reduced rate of alcohol absorption. Some patients also reported that they didn’t enjoy the flavor of thealcoholic beveragesas much, and also that hangovers were much worse. All of these experiences showed that the weight-loss medications create \"guard rails\" that prevent most patients from drinking excessively, giving them a degree of control over their alcohol intake, according to Le Roux. After starting the weight-loss medications, the participants’ weekly average alcohol intake decreased by almost two-thirds overall.(iStock) \"The findings in this study suggest that we may have just found atherapeutic targetfor alcohol use disorder — the GLP-1 receptor,\" the professor told Fox News Digital. \"This finding potentially opens the possibility of an entirely new pharmacological treatment paradigm, which could be used in conjunction with conventional methods, such asbehavior therapyand group support.\" The study was limited by its relatively small number of patients, the researchers acknowledged. Also, the researchers were not able to verify the participants’ self-reported alcohol intake, and roughly one-third of them were not available for follow-up. SEMAGLUTIDE FOUND TO HAVE SHOCKING BENEFIT FOR LIVER DISEASE PATIENTS IN NEW STUDY There was also no control group, which means the researchers couldn’t prove that taking weight-loss medication reduces alcohol intake. The main advantage of GLP-1 agonists is that they only need to be taken once a week and continue to work for the entire week.(iStock) \"Randomized,controlled trialswith diverse patient populations — including patients diagnosed with alcohol use disorder — are needed to provide the quality and quantity of data that could be used to support an application for licensing the medication for the treatment of alcohol use disorder,\" Le Roux said. (One such trial is currently underway in Denmark.) With the current medications available to treat alcohol use disorder, the \"major problem\" is compliance, Le Roux said — \"because the cravings for alcohol tend to come in waves.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"This means a patient might be fully committed to treatment at one point in the week, but then stop taking the medication later in the week when a craving comes,\" the professor added. \"This research suggests a promising ancillary benefit of GLP-1 analogs, potentially influencing cravings for alcohol and offering a new avenue for managing alcohol use disorder,\" a physician said.(iStock) There are currently three FDA-approved medications to treat alcohol use disorder: naltrexone (which helps decrease cravings by reducing the \"buzz\" feeling that comes with drinking alcohol); disulfiram (which helps some people avoid alcohol by making them feel sick when they drink), and acamprosate (which restores the balance ofhormones in the brainto reduce cravings), according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER But less than 10% of people with alcohol use disorder get the proper treatment, with many resuming use within the first year of treatment, past research shows. The main advantage of the GLP-1 agonists is that they only need to be taken once a week and continue to work for the entire week. For the 188 patients who were followed over an average of four months, none had increased their alcohol intake after starting the weight-loss medications.(iStock) Outside experts say the study’s findings highlight the potential of weight-loss medications to help treat alcohol use disorder. \"This research suggests a promising ancillary benefit of GLP-1 analogs, potentially influencing cravings for alcohol and offering a new avenue for managing alcohol use disorder,\" Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford,obesity medicine physicianat Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, who was not part of the study, told Fox News Digital.

    "title": "Biden battling 'most aggressive type' of prostate cancer with bone metastasis, medical expert says",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel unpacks former President Joe Biden's 'aggressive' prostate cancer diagnosis on 'Fox Report.' FormerPresident Joe Bidenwas diagnosed with an \"aggressive form\" of prostate cancer that has a five-year survival rate of between 30% and 40%. The former president's prostate cancer is characterized by a Gleason score of 9 and Grade Group 5 with bone metastasis, indicating that it is \"pretty far advanced,\" Fox News senior medical analystDr. Marc Siegelsaid on ‘Fox Report.’ \"It’s the most aggressive type,\" Siegel said. \"That means it has the highest risk of spread — which obviously he has had.\" Biden is also presenting with urinary symptoms, which is another sign thatthe canceris advanced. Prostate cancer often presents as asymptomatic in its early stages, he said. JOE BIDEN DIAGNOSED WITH 'AGGRESSIVE FORM' OF PROSTATE CANCER WITH METASTASIS TO THE BONE President Biden's cancer is \"pretty far advanced,\" according to Dr. Marc Siegel.(SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images) \"Thiswas found by physical examination by a prostate exam,\" Siegel said. \"A lot of times we find an elevation in prostate-specific antigen, PSA, and then we go after it… I mean, he must have had the best possible care here. I'm a little taken aback that it's this far advanced.\" Siegel said he conducts a prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, test on every male over the age of 45 years old. The test measures how much PSA is in the blood and is primarily used to screen for prostate cancer, according toMayo Clinic. NEW PROSTATE CANCER TEST PINPOINTS DISEASE BETTER THAN PSA OPTION, STUDY FINDS While the PSA test is not always a perfect indicator of prostate cancer, someone who has a rise in PSA automatically gets an MRI, Siegel said. After the MRI, a decision is made about whether to conduct a biopsy. More than 80% of men over the age of 80 years old have some prostate cancer cells in their body, according to Siegel. \"It would be really surprising if they weren't doing a very close screening on this because everybody knows in themedical communitythat this is the one cancer in men you really look out for,\" he said. \"… He doesn't seem to have a lot of risk factors that I would think about other than age, but age is enough and he's 82, so that's a big risk factor.\" Doctors will likely treat Biden with hormone therapy, Siegel said. They may also attempt to radiate the lesion found on the bone or remove the prostate altogether. PROSTATE CANCER DRUG NOW AVAILABLE TO MORE PATIENTS WITH AGGRESSIVE FORM OF DISEASE \"Sometimes they decide to do more than one therapy,\" Siegel said. \"They might try to take the prostate out, do radiation and the hormone therapy altogether. That's not uncommon.\" There are two typesof medicationsused to treat this type of advanced prostate cancer — Lupron, which stops testosterone production, and Casodex, which stops testosterone from binding. Side effects of the medication can leave people feeling \"fatigued and listless,\" according to Siegel. The PSA test measures how much PSA is in the blood and is primarily used to screen for prostate cancer.(iStock) \"Theother thing I'm concerned about is bone pain, because those metastases to the bone can be pretty painful,\" he said. If the cancer is caught early while its still localized to the prostate gland, it’s curable \"most of the time,\" Siegel said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"The goal is to get it before it leaves the prostate,\" Siegel said. \"When it's left the prostate, it becomes much more difficult to cure.\" Sophia Compton is a Digital Production Assistant at Fox News Digital.

    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy pushed back on allegations that \"hateful comments\" were reportedly made towardAngel Reeseduring the Chicago Sky’s game against the Indiana Fever. TheWNBAlaunched an investigation on Sunday. The remarks were allegedly made toward the second-year Sky star during Saturday’s matchup, according to The Associated Press. The league said it \"strongly condemns racism, hate and discrimination in all forms.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Chicago Sky forward Angel Reese, #5, looks to shoot a basket on Saturday, May 17, 2025 during a game between the Indiana Fever and the Chicago Sky at Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis on May 17, 2025.(Grace Smith-IndyStar via Imagn Images) No specifics were presented, and Portnoy cast doubt on whether the comments happened and speculated that internet trolls could have been behind it. Portnoy was at the game at the Gainbridge Fieldhouse and sat courtside in a Caitlin Clark jersey. Portnoy said in a video posted to his X account that the only \"hate\" he saw came from Reese against Clark after the Fever star hit Reese with a hard foul in the third quarter. Reese let Clark know emphatically that she did not like it. Clark was given a flagrant foul but said there was \"no malicious intent\" behind it. \"Listen, I was at the game. If there was somebody being racist or saying s---, obviously boot ’em. Never let them back,\" Portnoy said. \"I would be stunned beyond belief if that was the case. … The crowd at the Fever game? Little girls, families, ladies, nice crowd. Were we mad when Angel Reese attacked Cailtin Clark for no reason? Yeah. Did we boo her? Yeah. Is it sports? Yeah. \"For the WNBA, and now the Indiana Fever, to issue statements, ‘We’re investigating,’ unless something so preposterous happened that nobody in the stadium saw — there’s not an ounce of proof, there’s not a video of it, there’s not camera phone of it — unless something happened, which I know it didn’t. For them to acknowledge this and, again, kind of paint Indiana Fever fans, like, by just saying ‘We’re investigating the hate’ … even though it’s 100% false, by acknowledging ‘We don’t condone hate,’ and not seeing that this was an internet rumor founded of complete bulls---, you’re lending credence to this.\" Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy looks up at the scoreboard on Saturday, May 17, 2025 during a game between the Indiana Fever and the Chicago Sky at Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis on May 17, 2025.(Grace Smith-IndyStar via Imagn Images) ANGEL REESE 'HATES' CAITLIN CLARK, FORMER NFL STAR SAYS AFTER TEMPERS FLARE IN WNBA MATCHUP Portnoy added that the crowd was good and that Reese \"deserved\" to at least be booed but had a message for the WNBA. \"Angel Reese deserved to get her a-- booed when she attacked Caitlin on a normal foul,\" he said. \"Other than that, what are you talking about? The WNBA, talk about killing the golden goose. Like, you guys are lucky you have Caitlin Clark. You are lucky you have the Indiana Fever. It makes the league relevant. All you do is s--- on ‘em. \"And for the Fever, by the way, to even put out that statement, I’ll eat my words if you find one iota, or if there’s even one person who is doing something. Being in that crowd, seeing that crowd, being at the game, zero point zero, zero, zero, zero, zero chance there’s any truth to this. And you add validity when you acknowledge the statement, ‘We don’t condone hate.’ There was no hate. The only hate was coming from Angel Reese attacking Caitlin Clark.\" The Women’s National Basketball Players Association (WNBPA)released a statementon the issue as well. \"The WNBPA is aware of reports of hateful comments at yesterday’s game in Indianapolis and supports the WNBA’s current investigation into this matter.

The reigningMasters championrecently arrived in Charlotte for the second major of the 2025 season, the PGA Championship. McIlroy ended the tournament in a three-way tie for 47th place, finishing the major at 3-over.

The United States Golf Association (USGA) ruled that McIlroy's driver was non-conforming. The ruling forced McIlroy to make a switch. McIlroy's name was linked to the failed the test and eventually became public knowledge, likely via a leak. USGA policy prevents the organization from disclosing the name of any player who receives a failed test.

It just doesn't make sense if you're in it for the spirit (of the game). The whole point is to protect the integrity of the field. If you don't test everyone across the board, I don't think you're protecting the whole field.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Amid the controversy, the PGA of America released a statement. \"We can confirm that the USGA was invited to do club testing at the PGA Championship, at the PGA of America's request,\"the statement readin part. \"That testing program is consistent with the same level of support that the USGA provides to the PGA Tour and other championships, as part of their regular programs for driver testing. The standard process is for about a third of the field to be randomly tested under the program. That was the case at Quail Hollow this week.

    "article_text": "The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, has opened \"Dead Sea Scrolls: The Exhibition,\" featuring a collection of ancient Jewish manuscripts along with 200 other artifacts. A \"copy\" of the famous document known as a symbol against tyranny and as a \"cornerstone of freedom\" has been discovered to be authentic. Harvard Law School in 1946 bought a \"copy\" of the Magna Carta for just $27.50 from a London legal book dealer, Sweet & Maxwell, according to a news release. British researchers fromKing’s College Londonand the University of East Anglia made the discovery while studying unofficial copies of Magna Carta. ANCIENT ROMAN MILITARY FORTIFICATIONS FOUND IN 'STRATEGIC LOCATION' One professor, David Carpenter, noticed the digital version of the document on the Harvard Law School Library website and realized it might be authentic. \"This is a fantastic discovery,\" Carpenter, a professor of medieval history at King’s College London, said in a HarvardLaw Schoolpress release.

(Source: Royal Ontario Museum) Paleontologists recently discovered a 506-million-year-old \"moth-like\" predator that lurked in prehistoric Canada. In a press release from theRoyal Ontario Museum(ROM), officials identified the creature as Mosura fentoni,an extinct arthropod, as news agencies including SWNS reported.(See the video at the top of this article.) The museum reported that most of theMosura fossils were collected by ROM paleontologists at Raymond Quarry in Yoho National Park in British Columbia. 'WELL-PRESERVED' BABY MAMMOTH DATING BACK TO ICE AGE DISSECTED BY SCIENTISTS: PHOTOS Most were found between 1975 and 2022. \"Mosura fentoni was about the size of your index finger and had three eyes, spiny jointed claws, a circular mouth lined with teeth and a body with swimming flaps along its sides,\" the museum noted. Mosura fentoni was an extinct arthropod that lived 506 million years ago, according to experts.(Royal Ontario Museum) \"These traits show it to be part of an extinct group known asthe radiodonts,which also included the famous Anomalocaris canadensis, a meter-long predator that shared the waters with Mosura.\" What makes the discovery so interesting to researchers is that Mosura had an abdomen-like body region made up of multiple segments at its back end – which had not been previously observed in any radiodonts. ANCIENT SETTLEMENT REVEALS REMAINS OF 1,800-YEAR-OLD DOG, BAFFLING EXPERTS: ‘PRESERVED QUITE WELL’ Joe Moysiuk, a curator of paleontology and geology at the Manitoba Museum, said Mosurahad 16 of these segments, all lined with gills. \"This is a neat example ofevolutionary convergencewith modern groups, like horseshoe crabs, woodlice and insects, which share a batch of segments bearing respiratory organs at the rear of the body,\" Moysiuk described. Fossils show the details of Mosura's internal anatomy – including its nervous system and digestive tract.(Royal Ontario Museum) The museum reported that the species has been nicknamed the \"sea-moth\" by field collectors based on its moth-like attributes.

    "article_text": "Nick Angeloff, a professor at California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, spoke with Fox News Digital about recent excavation work in North Macedonia. Ancient military fortifications dating back to the Ptolemaic and Roman eras ofEgyptian historywere recently uncovered by archaeologists. The Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities announced the discovery in a Facebook post, which was translated from Arabic to English, on May 3. Officials said that a recent excavation at the Tell Abu Sefeh site led to the uncovering of an expansive military complex. The Tell Abu Sefeh site is located in North Sinai, near the Egyptian city of Ismailia and the Suez Canal. ARCHAEOLOGISTS DISCOVER LONG-LOST TOMB OF UNKNOWN PHARAOH IN EGYPT Described as one of Egypt's \"important strategic locations,\" Tell Abu Sefeh emerged as a prominent location in antiquity. The ministry oftourism and antiquitiessaid the site played a \"pivotal role in protecting Egypt's eastern borders.\" There, archaeologists \"uncovered remains of military fortifications, soldiers' residential units, and a trench indicating the possibility of another fortress in the area,\" according to the ministry.

    "title": "Democrats are scheming to spread the tax misery of blue states nationwide",
    "article_text": "Rep. Mike Lawler, R-NY, joins 'Sunday Morning Futures' to discuss the Trump meeting with blue state Republicans over lifting the SALT cap and NYC congestion pricing. If you live in Florida or anotherlow-tax state, brace yourself. A bipartisan group of lawmakers from blue states is gearing up to punish you for your state’s fiscal restraint. They want to lift the cap on the federal income-tax deduction for state and local taxes, known as SALT. If they succeed, middle-class Americans in red states will once again have to subsidize wealthy taxpayers in states such as California and New York, where leaders continue to double down on decades of fiscal mismanagement. Before President Trump's2017 tax reform, the SALT deduction rewarded wealthy residents of high-tax states by reducing their federal taxes, while still giving them the same federal benefits. HANDFUl OF REPUBLICANS SINK TRUMP'S ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’ IN KEY HOUSE COMMITTEE This is in effect a hiddenwealth transferfrom less wealthy workers in low-tax states, who don't get the deduction and have to pay more in federal taxes. Capping the deduction at $10,000 was an ingenious way to address that injustice. It protected middle-class households while letting wealthy residents of high-tax states feel the pain of their actual tax liabilities. Coupled with heavy-handed Covid lockdowns, exposure to the reality of their states’ excessive taxation triggered mass migration. Since then, Florida has gained over a million new residents, while California and New York have each lost a million. Now, blue-state congressmen of both parties are threatening to blow upPresident Trump’s tax cuts, which will expire unless extended this year, unless the SALT deduction is reinstated or greatly expanded. That would be a terrible mistake. Raising the SALT cap primarily benefits the wealthy—households earning $200,000 or more—not the middle class. Middle-class families, who now almost always use the standard deduction, wouldn't gain a cent. Whopays the billfor this giveaway to affluent taxpayers? Everyone else. Increasing the SALT deduction creates budget shortfalls that would force higher taxes on the majority or lead to even greater, inflationary deficits. In short, middle-class families nationwide would bear the cost of restoring the abusive SALT deduction. Worse still, the SALT deduction undermines competitive federalism—the very foundation of our constitutional arrangement. The genius of the Constitution’s original federal structure, as it existed before the progressive and New Deal transformation of a century ago, was that it forced states to compete for residents and capital by keeping taxes low and regulations minimal. Progressives enamored of government deride that as a \"race to the bottom.\" They have consistently used the federal tax code to sabotage interstate competition, particularly after the 16th Amendment greatly expanded Congress’s taxing power in 1913. In the 1920s, they banded together in Congress to enact a federal estate tax, and then provided that people could deduct their state estate tax liabilities from the federal tax. The scheme specifically targeted Florida, which had earlier repealed its estate tax on its way to becoming the nation’s retirement haven. It deprived retirees of the choice between high-tax and low-tax states. Henceforth their choice would be between paying a high estate tax in their state or paying it to the federal government. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Florida sued, arguing that this scheme amounted to afederal taxon some states but not others. Alas, an increasingly progressive Supreme Court rejected the claim in Florida vs. Mellon (1927). Today's SALT advocates from California, New York, New Jersey, and Illinois complain about \"double taxation,\" yet it is they who routinely double- and triple-tax their constituents. Their real grievance? Trump's SALT cap made their high taxes transparent to everyone—and politically costly. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Florida stands to lose a great deal from the push to restore the SALT deduction. It would erode the state's competitive advantage, forcing it to subsidize fiscal irresponsibility elsewhere, and punishing Floridians for their state’s successful, pro-growth policies. The SALT deduction isn't just welfare for the wealthy. It’s a scheme to spread the tax misery of blue states nationwide. Congress should be thinking about repealing it entirely, not restoring it to benefit the wealthiest. Mario Loyola is a professor at Florida International University.",

    "title": "REP. SARA JACOBS: Military families deserve IVF coverage and Trump’s support",
    "article_text": "Can a $5,000 cash payment help boost the U.S. birth rate? Today, May 19, 2025, is the deadline for policy recommendations on ways to implementPresident Donald Trump’s executive orderto expand access to in vitro fertilization (IVF) and lower its costs. And while his administration is currently contemplating some bizarre and patronizing ways to raise birth rates, like baby bonuses and motherhood awards, my suggestion is to support military families who desperately want to grow their families. I’m incredibly proud to represent San Diego, the biggest military community in the country, which is home to 110,000 active-duty service members and more than 118,000 of their family members. So, I hear all the time about their lives and their struggles to pay rent and put food on the table, their inability to find reliable childcare, their concerns about their safety, and their journeys withinfertility. For example, a senior-enlisted sailor, Matt, shared with me that he and his wife Jenny had two daughters via IVF – after five miscarriages, seven frozen embryo transfers, 600 shots and spending $80,000. PRO-LIFE LEADERS URGE TRUMP TO REVERSE HIS IVF STAND, SAY THE TECHNOLOGY IS 'NOT PRO-LIFE' About a quarter of active-duty service members and military spouses report infertility, which is double the national average of the general population. When we think about the level of sacrifices we’re asking from ourmilitary families,their struggles with infertility make sense. President Donald Trump signed an executive order supporting IVF. FILE: Trump in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, Tuesday, Feb. 25, 2025.(Pool) Our service members endure physically intensive training, demanding schedules, and frequent relocations during their prime reproductive years. Deployments are often long and stressful, where they’re physically separated from their partner, which also takes an emotional toll. On top of that, military service also means living and working in hazardous environments that can negatively impact fertility. Despite all of these well-documented stressors, TRICARE, the country’s military health insurance plan, only covers fertility services for those who can prove a service connection to injury or illness, which is often impossible to do. This leaves our military families with three realistic options: pay tens of thousands of dollars out-of-pocket for a chance at a family, forgo having children or leave the military altogether. Thecost-of-living crisisis affecting everyone in our country, but especially military families, many of whom live on fixed incomes and struggle to afford childcare, housing and food on the table. This isn’t a demographic that can easily afford tens of thousands of dollars out-of-pocket on anything, so folks are leaving the military for this coverage, worsening our recruitment and retention challenges and impacting our military readiness. FLASHBACK: TRUMP SEEKS TO EXPAND FERTILITY COVERAGE, AFTER TIM WALZ ONCE ACCUSED HIM OF BEING ‘ANTI-IVF’ Military families need IVF access. They deserve it. And they’ve earned it. That’s why I introduced the\"IVF for Military Families Act\"alongside Illinois Democrat Senator Tammy Duckworth to require TRICARE to cover infertility diagnosis and treatment, including IVF. Our legislation would cover up to three complete egg retrievals, unlimited embryo transfers, and the necessary medications for IVF and intrauterine insemination (IUI). CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Starting this year, members of Congress and our staff have access to comprehensive infertility treatment, including IVF coverage, just like many other civilian employees in the federal and private sectors. We shouldn’t have access to benefits that our military families don’t have. But despite this hypocrisy, our bill still lacks support from my Republican colleagues in both the House and Senate. I’m (obviously) skeptical of Trump’s commitment to expanding IVF access, but he has called himself the \"Fertilization President\" and the \"father of IVF.\" If he wants that to be true, he should throw his support behind a demographic that has already sacrificed so much for the safety and security of our country: our military families. NASCAR STAR'S WIFE THANKS TRUMP FOR IVF EXECUTIVE ORDER: 'STEP FORWARD' ExpandingTRICARE coverageof IVF could be the watershed moment needed to change the entire market and ensure that everyone in our country has access to IVF. It could put market pressure on private insurers to include IVF and other fertility treatments in their healthcare coverage plans so they remain competitive. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP This leaves our military families with three realistic options: pay tens of thousands of dollars out-of-pocket for a chance at a family, forgo having children or leave the military altogether. While theIVF for Military Families Actwould be a monumental step forward, the ultimate goal is for everyone to have access to the full range of reproductive care, so they have the power and the ability to decide when and if to have children. We ask so much from our service members – to risk their safety, to be apart from their families, and to give up certain freedoms – but we shouldn’t ask them to give up their opportunity to build a family. As a country, we need to do more than say we value our military community, we need to actually show it. And I think President Trump has a great place to start by supporting our bill to expand IVF coverage for military families. Rep. Sara Jacobs represents California’s 51st District in Congress.

    "title": "Trump’s ‘big beautiful bill’ needs a 'fat shot' to end our dangerous debt addiction",
    "article_text": "National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett unpacks the importance of economic growth under President Donald Trump on 'The Story.' The United States has a hair-on-fire problem: its debt. This reality is not disputed by pretty much any credible person or entity, including the Treasury and the Fed.U.S. government debtis massive, currently north of 120% of GDP, an amount that is close to double what many institutions consider to be sustainable debt levels. Our deficit is running at a wartime level, around double the historic average as a percent of GDP, and interest on the debt has now surpassed spending on defense, which is not a healthy indicator for a country and its fiscal stability. A main cause of this issue isCongressand their years of reckless overspending. Unfortunately, it lies in their hands to fix the problem they helped create. US HEADING TOWARDS ECONOMIC ‘HEART ATTACK’ IF DEBT IS NOT CUT SOON: WORLD’S LARGEST HEDGE FUND FOUNDER Currently, Congress is at work on \"one big, beautiful bill\" to address taxes and spending. And what we have seen thus far is still too big and doesn’t address the critical issues at hand. Frankly, the new bill needs a \"fat shot\" (the humorous moniker President Donald Trump used for weight-loss drugs like Ozempic). And without it, we are just going to push our country nearer to a fiscal cliff. America is facing a looming debt crisis. Will Congress have the will to fix it? The problem with our finances is not one of tax collection, it is a spending problem. Federal government \"revenue\" was nearly $5 trillion for last fiscal year. That is more than the GDP of every country on earth, except the U.S. and China. Still, that is not enough for the government, which then spends that $5 trillionplusanother $2 trillion – around 6-7% of GDP – which then needs to be financed. After decades of being irresponsible, we are dangerously close to thatfiscal cliff.I worry about the prospects of a debt spiral. That is where the interest on our debt drives up the deficit (as it has). As the government needs to finance that deficit, the supply of Treasury debt increases. That then drives up Treasury yields, which increases our interest costs. That increases the deficits, which again have the same impact and that vicious cycle continues. SEAN HANNITY: THE CONTINUING RESOLUTION IS A 'TOTAL, UNMITIGATED DISASTER' And that’s with debt servicing costs, running at $1.2 trillion at the end of 2024, plus entitlements already exceeding the tax revenue collected, before considering any other spending. Yet, while everyone knows our debt position is a problem, there doesn’t seem to be the political will to fix it. In a recent X post, Stephen Moore, who has advised Trump on economic issues,posted, \"You’ll need a microscope to see the GOP’s spending cuts! The CBO projects a staggering $89.3 trillion in federal spending over the next decade. The House plan proposes a mere $1.2 trillion reduction, leading to a total of $88.1 trillion—a tiny 1.5% cut! Meanwhile, the Senate suggests an almost laughable $4 billion reduction against $521 billion in increases. By 2035, the GOP’s ‘starvation diet’ still lands us at $10 trillion in spending—up from last year’s $7 trillion, only 40% increase instead of 50%.\" This does not bode well for our financial future. SHOCKING GOVERNMENT REPORT REVEALS NATIONAL DEBT CRISIS GREW MUCH WORSE UNDER BIDEN The Trump administration has several paths available to be able to buy us some time, patch up our fiscal foundation and solidify our future. However, none of those options make sense if Congress can’t be reined in long term. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Consider theDOGEefforts. We know that the program has identified a great deal of waste, fraud and abuse already. While that is great in theory, we need to see it moved by Congress into concrete, long-term spending reductions. The problem with our finances is not one of tax collection, it is a spending problem. Federal government \"revenue\" was nearly $5 trillion for last fiscal year. That is more than the GDP of every country on earth, except the U.S. and China. Given that, with GOP control of Congress, spending is still not being reined in, our long-term fiscal prospects are grim. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP We need a small, beautiful bill or, even better, a bunch of small, focused bills, with a real plan to reduce spending and to make sure Congress can’t continue to run up our debt, deficit and interest expense.

    "article_text": "Fox News' Lucas Tomlinson reports the latest on President Donald Trump's Mideast business deals from Abu Dhabi. Sen. Tim Sheehy, R-Mont., joins 'The Faulkner Focus' to discuss his take on the president's trip and the latest on Iran nuclear talks. PresidentDonald J. Trump’sMiddle East swing was one big, beautiful business trip – and America foreign policy will never be the same. As we saw over and over again, Trump believes international relations work best when they consist of sharp-elbowed business deals. When countries are busy trading, launching construction projects, developing AI, etc., then ideology and military confrontation diminish and tolerance thrives. Of course, Trump’s battering of the Houthis with aircraft carriers and bombers greatly facilitated this trip. But make no mistake. This is peace through strength: economic strength. Commerce, not conflict. TRUMP WRAPS MOMENTOUS MIDDLE EAST TRIP WITH ECONOMIC DEALS, SYRIA SANCTIONS RELIEF AND WARNING TO IRAN Way back in 1987, when the U.S. Navy was protecting oil tankers from Iran, Trump spent $95,000 on a full-page ad in the New York Times to tell America to stop paying to defend countries that can afford to defend themselves. \"We are protective of Saudi Arabia. They should pay for it,\" Trump said to Larry King on CNN on Sep. 2, 1987. President Donald Trump and UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan talk on Thursday, May 15.(AP/Alex Brandon) Forty years later, as a second-term president, Trump has swept away tenets that drove American foreign policy for the last hundred years. President Woodrow Wilson making the world safe for democracy as he led America into World War I in 1917? Gone. Foreign aid soft-power culture projects? All over. TRUMP MAKES HISTORIC UAE VISIT AS FIRST US PRESIDENT IN NEARLY 30 YEARS Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama rabble-rousing the Arab spring of 2011 and ditching friends like Hosni Mubarak of Egypt? Not anymore. Russian military bases in Syria and China cutting deals across theMiddle East?Not so fast. And you already know the new deal with NATO, an alliance dating from 1949. Going forward, America will remain the lead security partner deterring Russia, but trade deals will be squared up. Adding to the shock and awe, Trump expanded the roster of his national security team for this away game. The secretaries of State, Defense, Treasury and Commerce were joined by businessmen: Tesla CEO Elon Musk, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg, GE Aerospace CEO Larry Culp and others. Why? Trump is putting businessmen on the field to run plays that boost the U.S. and knock back China. TRUMP CONDEMNS 'INTERVENTIONALISTS,' PITCHES 'MORE HOPEFUL FUTURE' IN MIDDLE EAST SPEECH And not a moment too soon. For it is the rise of China and the technology threat of AI that has made Trump’s shift urgent. U.S. President Donald J. Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman attend a signing ceremony at the Saudi Royal Court on May 13, 2025, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.(Getty Images) Here are six major scores fromhis Middle East trip. Trump raked in over $2 trillion ininvestment pledgesfrom Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE. This is real money, coming directly to America. Check out the UAE investing $1.4 trillion in the U.S., ranging from natural gas in Texas to data centers to the first new U.S. aluminum smelting facility in 35 years. Long-term, this may be the single most valuable outcome of Trump’s trip. You don’t want a world where China rules in artificial intelligence, and Saudi Arabia, the UAE and others end up in Xi Jinping’s lap. Trump has made AI leadership a priority for U.S.foreign policy. TRUMP TARGETS MASSIVE INVESTMENTS IN FIRST MIDDLE EAST TRIP The UAE is going full AI and will import 500,000 Nvidia chips per year for AI datacenters. Allowing sales to Mideast partners will help U.S. companies gain global market share over China. You can bet Commerce has ways to monitor how chips are used, and restrictions remain on the most advanced chips, but let me be clear. It was us or China. I’m glad Jensen Huang, and notXi Jinping,got that deal. Playing to an American export strength, the trip yielded a gigantic order from Qatar Airways for 130 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, 30 777-9s, and options for 50 more jets, making this the biggest widebody order ever. Boeing says the order supports 400,000 American jobs throughout the supply chain. Qatar will also purchase some extremely advanced \"Desert Viper\" F-16 Block 60 fighter jets with upgraded engines, the AN/APG-80 AESA radar and more. Saudi Arabia restocks vital AIM-120 missiles, with a big order that will also help the U.S. speed up production for our own stockpile to deter China.

Al-Sharaa is a radical-turned opportunist, and bylifting sanctions,Trump is calculating that a better Syrian economy will be stabilizing.  \"It’s not going to be easy anyway. So, it gives them a good, strong chance,\" Trump told leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council in Riyadh. TRUMP'S 17TH WEEK BACK IN OFFICE TO FOCUS ON MIDDLE EAST TRIP, ADMIN LEADERS IRONING OUT CHINA TRADE TALKS Is Syria an ally or an enemy, wondered NBC News. Wrong question. Syria is neither; lifting sanctions is a chess move. \"We do not want to be stuck with China being the only choice for Syria,\" Dr. Sharvan Ibesh of the Bahar Organization, a humanitarian NGO active in Syria, told Gordon Chang on May 7. Don’t forget that U.S. Central Command’s A-10s, B-52s and F-15Es knocked the stuffing out of ISIS weapons caches in Syria last winter. \"Iran can have a much brighter future,\" Trump said in Riyadh. You know the ayatollah gasped when Syria got its sanctions lifted. All the business deals were a vivid message toIran.Dump the weapons program and \"nuclear dust\" as Trump calls it and reap the economic benefits. Of course, Trump is keeping U.S. aircraft carriers, bombers and more pointed straight at Iran.

Trump’s deals are far better than China’s underhanded Belt and Road projects. Bonus points for pouring cold water on China’s overtures in Syria. And Putin is writhing over the loss of Russian bases in Syria, which his Wagner Group cronies used to support military operations in Africa.

    "title": "Meta repeatedly endangers children while parents remain sidelined",
    "article_text": "Center for Humane Technology co-founder Tristan Harris joined 'The Brian Kilmeade Show' to discuss the dangers of AI and foreign influence in social media. If past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior, Meta has given parents every reason to be distrustful. On more than one occasion,Meta’s social media products,which include Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, have endangered children. Its fixes come late or only after external attention and pressure. Their parental controls often fall short, are extremely cumbersome, or don’t keep pace with evolving technology and new features. If Meta truly cares about child safety – or about salvaging its reputation related to child safety – a new path that includes parents must be charted. As a mother, I am tired of seeing report after report of Meta’s willingness to place engagement metrics and company growth ahead of basicchild safety.Whether pushing untested technologies that harm children’s mental health or exposing young users to inappropriate and extreme sexual content, the company has shown a dangerous willingness to look the other way. SOCIAL MEDIA GIANT HIT WITH SCATHING AD CAMPAIGN AMID ANGER OVER AI CHATBOTS SEXUALLY EXPLOITING KIDS With Meta’s recent launch of AI \"digital companions\" a new controversy was born. These interactive chatbots allegedly designed to simulate friendly, personalized conversations were marketed broadly and made available to users as young as 12. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been criticized by parents' groups for not doing enough to protect children on the company's social media platforms. FILE: Zuckerberg spoke with comedian Theo Von on his \"This Past Weekend\" podcast.(Theo Von YouTube channel) As the Wall Street Journalreported, however, the chatbots were soon caught engaging with minors in graphic, sexually explicit exchanges, including simulated predatory scenarios. The company claimed it restricted those features from children, but Meta staffers found that \"within a few prompts, the AI will violate its rules and produce inappropriate content even if you tell the AI you are 13.\" Dr. Nina Vasan, a Stanford psychiatrist and director of Stanford Brainstorm, has called the rise of AI companions among children \"a potential publicmental health crisisrequiring preventive action rather than just reactive measures.\" According to Vasan, these bots are failing \"the most basic tests of child safety and psychological ethics.\" TEENS ARE NOW USING AI CHATBOTS TO CREATE AND SPREAD NUDE IMAGES OF CLASSMATES, ALARMING EDUCATION EXPERTS She’s right, and it should not take a task force to see that. Anyone raising children in the digital age understands theemotional and developmental risksthese technologies pose. If Meta cared about, or even considered child safety, that much would be obvious. Unfortunately, Meta has a well-documented history of flouting child safety. In 2024, the WSJfoundMeta’s Instagram platform recommendation system pushing sexually explicit videos to accounts set up as 13-year-olds within minutes. Another investigationrevealedthat Instagram \"helps connect and promote a vast network of accounts openly devoted to the commission and purchase of underage-sex content.\" In other words, its algorithm is actively amplifying pedophile networks. Meta’s own internal reviews haveadmittedthe company’s subscription tools have been used to promote sexualized child modeling accounts to suspected predators. SCAMMERS ARE TARGETING TEENS WITH THESE NASTY TRICKS Each time these failures come to light, the company insists it has made fixes, patched programs, or installed parental controls. Parents are expected to take their word for it. But why should we when a mountain of evidence suggests otherwise? I, for one, don’t buy what Meta is selling. That’s why, as executive director ofAmerican Parents Coalition,our organization sent a letter to the Senate and House committees with oversight in this area urging them to open a full investigation into Meta’s repeated failures and its pattern of child endangerment. Whether or not there is congressional intervention, Meta can start making changes today. One such step would be creating an external parental advisory committee. While expert voices are welcome, what’s really missing are the parents in the trenches – \"real\" parents who are raising kids in the real world, aren’t steeped in the latest techno-babble and can truly \"red-team\" new features, navigate parental controls, and provide feedback. HOW TO (KINDLY) ASK PEOPLE NOT TO POST YOUR KIDS' PHOTOS ON SOCIAL MEDIA The American Parents Coalition is calling for a congressional investigation into how Meta treats children on its social media platforms. FILE: Meta HQ in Menlo Park, CA(AP Photo/Tony Avelar) This board should have access to product development, the power to flag risks, and the authority to make public recommendations. If Meta is serious about addressing these dangers, it should welcome outside oversight. The mounting data in support of delaying or forbidding access to smartphones and social media is convincing. It’s a route our family has chosen and one that I encourage others to follow. However, not every family will make that choice. Many will rely on parental controls and others still will allow unfettered access. Regardless of a family’s path, parents cannot stand guard over every algorithm, every software update, every hidden risk embedded in the platforms our children access. PARENTS TRUST AI FOR MEDICAL ADVICE MORE THAN DOCTORS, RESEARCHERS FIND Anyone raising children in the digital age understands the emotional and developmental risks these technologies pose. If Meta cared about, or even considered child safety, that much would be obvious. The mental and physical safety of the next generation should be of paramount concern to our technological leaders and elected representatives alike. Accountability should begin with a thorough congressional investigation into Meta’s conduct, including its product safety practices and repeated failures to establish basic child protection measures. That alone, however, won’t be a long-term fix. Real change requires Meta to bring parents into the fold and with a permanent seat at the table. Until these changes occur, no parent should take Meta at its word and should suspend their child’s access to these platforms.

The move comes ahead of the companies’ public robotaxi launch this summer. Customers selected for early access will be notified in the Uber app and via email. Those who opt for the robotaxi rides will be encouraged to provide feedback during and after the ride. As an extra incentive, riders will receive $10 worth of Uber credits after their first Waymo ride. Atlanta is the second city to get the “Waymo on Uber” service. The companies launched the service, which matches riders with a Waymo via the Uber app, in Austin this spring. Uber and Waymolast September announcedplans to offer a robotaxi service in Austin and Atlanta in early 2025 as part of an expanded partnership. Under the partnership, only Uber users can hail Waymo’s fleet of autonomous Jaguar I-PACE vehicles. Like every other city that Waymo has launched in — a list that includes Los Angeles, Phoenix, and San Francisco — the service area in Atlanta will grow over time. Waymo and Uber have agreed to initially offer robotaxi rides in a 65-square-mile area in Atlanta, including downtown, Buckhead, and Capitol View neighborhoods. The “Waymo on Uber” service splits the responsibilities of owning and operating a fleet of driverless vehicles: Uber handles the charging, maintenance, and cleaning of the autonomous vehicles, as well as managing access to the robotaxis via its app, while Waymo monitors the tech and the autonomous operations, including rider assistance.

Luminar’s board announced Wednesday — the same day of its first-quarter earnings report — it had replaced Russell and appointed Paul Ricci to the role. Ricci is the former chairman and CEO of Nuance. Thepress releasestates that Russell resigned as president and CEO and as the chairperson of the board, effective immediately. The board said in the press release the resignation followed a code of business conduct and ethics inquiry for the audit committee of Luminar’s board. Russell will remain on the board and be “available to the incoming Chief Executive Officer on transition and technology matters,” according to the release. A day after the leadership change was announced, board member Jun Hong Heng also resigned,according to a regulatory filing, which stated his decision was not due to any disagreements with the company on any matter relating to the company’s operations, policies, or practices. It’s not clear if Russell was forced out or if he resigned willingly. Russell could not be reached for comment. Heng could not be reached for comment. The board did not provide further details of this ethics inquiry except that it “does not impact any of the company’s financial results.” In a further twist, the company’s earnings report and slide presentation makes no mention of the change of leadership. The first-quarter press release even includes an upbeat statement from Russell that outlines the company’s strategy to drive down cost with its new Halo product. “In a world of macro uncertainty and adversity, we’re firing on all cylinders to ramp up production, ramp down costs, and capitalize on the future, as evidenced by our announcements today,” Russell said in the statement. “This kicks off our new operating plan for Luminar with a unified product platform, enabling radical focus and streamlining of the business, as well as unlocking value throughout our organization.” Meanwhile, the press release from the board tells another story. “We are excited to announce Paul as our next CEO,” board member Matt Simoncini said in a statement. “His track record speaks for itself. He is a visionary leader with a rare combination of technical insight and operational excellence. His commitment to innovation, his ability to scale organizations, and his instinct for anticipating where technology is heading make him the ideal person to lead us into our next chapter of growth. The Board has full confidence in his leadership, and we are excited about what lies ahead.”Simoncini, who retired as CEO of Lear in 2018, is chair of the board’s audit committee, which also includes Jun Hong Heng, who is the founder and chief investment officer of technology investment firm Crescent Cove Advisors, Evergreen Capital Partners founder Dominick Schiano, and Daniel Tempesta, who served as executive VP and CFO at Nuance. Luminar burst onto the autonomous vehicle scenein April 2017after operating for years in secrecy. Russell, who was just 22 years old at the time, was thrust into the spotlight and became a Silicon Valley success story. Luminar was founded byRussellin 2012, but it would be years before his company would be known by the public. He worked on the Luminar technology as aThiel fellow,which gives young people $100,000 over two years to drop out of college and pursue their ideas. In 2021, Luminar merged with special purpose acquisition company Gores Metropoulos Inc., with a post-deal market valuation of $3.4 billion. Luminar raised $250 million prior to the SPAC announcement.

In a newfiling, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers confirms the court has receivedEpic Games’ latest motion, where it demands that Apple approve Fortnite for distribution on the App Store. The clearly annoyed judge asks Apple to show the court the “legal authority upon which Apple contends that it can ignore this Court’s order.” Gonzalez Rogers also suggests that Apple will need to return to court to explain if the situation is not addressed. “Apple is fully capable of resolving this issue without further briefing or a hearing,” Gonzalez Rogers reminds the tech giant, before adding that Apple name the company official who’s responsible for ensuring compliance with the court’s decision. pic.twitter.com/PUwvX8fgGe Reading between the lines, the demand for the name of the Apple official in the new filing suggests that Gonzalez Rogers is not above considering contempt charges for failing to comply with the court’s injunction. This follows her earlier ruling, where the judge skeweredApple for attempting to route around the court’s ordersand accused the tech company of lying under oath. Afterwinningthe right to include links to external payment mechanisms in its app,Epic Games resubmitted Fortnite to the U.S. App Store. However,Apple told the game makerthat it decided not to take action onEpic Games’ submissionuntil after the Ninth Circuit rules on Apple’s pending request for a partial stay of the new injunction. (In other words, Apple said it didn’t have to approve the app until the legal proceedings around itsappealfully played out.) Epic Games on Fridayfiled a motion to compelthe court to enforce the injunction, given Apple’s decision. The latest legal threat follows a years-long court battle over Apple’s App Store policies, which had long denied app developers the right to link to external payment options without paying Apple a commission. Apple originally complied with the court’s decision in the lawsuit by allowing U.S. developers to apply for an exception to its App Store rules, but it still collected a 27% commission on those alternative purchases, down from the usual 30%. Apple also required developers to use “scare screens” that warned consumers when they were clicking through to make a purchase outside its App Store. In a major victory for developers, Gonzalez Rogers ruled Apple was in “willful violation” of the court’s injunction on anticompetitive pricing and commissions, which would have seemingly allowed Fortnite to return to the App Store. But Apple sat on the submission for a week instead, neither approving nor denying the game’s publication, while its lawyers crafted a response. What happens next could be significant for Apple, as it may inspire similar legal action or regulation in other global markets. Apple was the victor in Epic’s original antitrust lawsuit against the tech giant, as the court declared it was not a monopolist. However,Epic Games carved out a win in one areawhen Gonzalez Rogers agreed that iPhone users should have access to alternative payment options if a developer wanted to use its own website for in-app purchases, like those for virtual goods or subscriptions. Following the decision, Appleupdatedits App Store policies for the U.S., and apps, includingSpotify,AmazonKindle, andPatreonquickly rolled out new versions of their apps to take advantage of the new functionality. Epic Games declined to comment. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. Topics Consumer News Editor Sarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

The VC market is “going through [one of its] cyclical winters marked by high interest rates, tightened liquidity, and cautious LP sentiment,” Akio Tanaka, a co-founder of and partner at Headline Asia, a Tokyo- and Taipei-based VC firm, told TechCrunch in an interview. Yet funds are still closing.Headline Asiasaid Tuesday it had completed one of its largest funds to date, Headline Asia Fund V, at $145 million to invest in tech startups across Asia-Pacific. (Headlinepreviously saidthat it was targeting $180 million for the fund.) Headline’s latest fund is earmarked for startup founders building companies targeting digital transformation and cross-border operations in Japan, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia, with selective investment in South Korea. Headline invests in early-stage — seed to Series A — with check sizes ranging from $1 million to $5 million in e-commerce, logistics, fintech, IP, and AI. Backers of Headline Asia’s fifth fund include a mix of public and private entities, including Japan Investment Corporation (JIC), the National Development Fund of Taiwan (NDF), Korea Venture Investment Corporation (KVIC), and SME Support Japan. Headline’s new fund has already invested in 17 companies, includingNewmo,a Japanese taxi and ride-sharing startup;Jenfi, a Singapore-based company providing revenue-based financing for digital businesses and startups in Southeast Asia; andPi-xcels, a Tokyo- and Singapore-based startup that delivers NFC-enabled tech for merchants to send receipts to their customers. Certain investors in Southeast Asiaprefer to make safe investments that generate profitsinstead of investing in high-growth, high-risk tech startups in a challenging funding climate. Headline aims to make investments that these investors won’t. “Early-stage valuations are still where the most outsized returns are made,” Tanaka said, “especially in today’s exit environment, where later-stage valuations have compressed and liquidity remains limited.” Tanaka told TechCrunch that the firm is particularly excited about opportunities in Japan. In the past, most Japanese startups have focused on business in their local market, according to Tanaka. There were numerous IPO deals, although they were relatively small in size. “Many startup founders in Japan found it low-hanging fruit to go public with a relatively small offering,” Tanaka added. “We are very much interested in global startups coming out of Asia, whether it’s Japanese startups going international, or maybe Southeast Asia or North Asian startups going global.” Headline Asia is part ofthe Headline global network, with regional offices in the U.S., Europe, and Latin America. The VC has about $4 billion in assets under management. Founded in 2008, Headline Asia, which has backed over 100 startups, manages approximately $420 million in assets across its five funds. The firm employs 10 investment professionals in Tokyo, Taipei, and Singapore. The closure of Headline’s newest fund comes on the heels of other Asia-focused VC fundraises. Antler closed a$72 million Southeast Asia fundin August, and MindWorks Capital, a Hong Kong-based VC firm,completed a fourth Pan-Asia fund at $220 millionin October.

The bill criminalizes the publication of such images, whether they’re authentic or AI-generated. Whoever publishes the photos or videos can face criminal penalties, including fines, imprisonment, and restitution. Under the new law, social media companies and online platforms must remove such material within 48 hours of notice from the victim. The platforms also have to take steps to delete duplicate content. Many states have already banned sexually explicit deepfakes and revenge porn, but this will be the first time federal regulators step in to impose restrictions on internet companies. “This will be the first-ever federal law to combat the distribution of explicit, imagery posted without subjects’ consent,” Trump said during a bill signing event Monday at the White House. “We will not tolerate online sexual exploitation.” First Lady Melania Trump lobbied for the bill, which was sponsored by Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.). Cruz said he was inspired to act after hearing that Snapchat refused for nearly a year to remove an AI-generated deepfake of a 14-year-old girl.

The new deal covers solar and storage projects being developed in South Carolina by EnergyRe. The company says it has 16 gigawatts under development; most projectslistedon its site have deployed around 60 MW to 75 MW of solar, though some are larger. Google has recently invested heavily in renewables. Last year, itpledged to invest$20 billion with Intersect Power and TPG Rise Climate to build enough zero-carbon power plants to provide electricity for several gigawatts’ worth of data centers. And in January, the company signed a contract to buy over700 megawattsof solar projects in Oklahoma from Leeward Renewable Energy. Like many tech companies, Google has said it will eliminate its carbon footprint from energy by 2030. After years of steady investment in renewables, Google and its peers had been marching steadily toward that goal. But the growth of AI and the compute needed to run it has complicated that math, forcing Google and others to step up their purchases. The company contracted 4 gigawatts of clean powerin 2023, the last year for which Google has made data available. Google isn’t alone: Microsoft has added hundreds of megawatts of solar this year alone, including a475 megawatt purchasein March.

AMD announcedon Monday that it was selling ZT Systems’ server-manufacturing business to electronic manufacturing services company Sanmina. The $3 billion deal is a mix of cash and stock: $2.25 billion in cash; a $300 million premium, including 50% cash and 50% equity; and a $450 million contingent payment based on financial performance over the next three years,according to Reuters. The deal is expected to close by the end of 2025, subject to regulatory approval. After this divestiture, AMD will maintain control of ZT Systems’ rack-scale AI solutions design business. This announcement isn’t a shock. WhenAMD announced its intent to acquire ZT Systems, an AI and cloud infrastructure company, for $4.9 billion in August 2024, the company said at the time that it planned to divest that part of ZT Systems’ business after the deal formally closed.

Cocospy, Spyic, andSpyziewere three near-identical but differently brandedstalkerwareapps that allowed the person planting one of the apps on a target’s phone access to their personal data — including their messages, photos, call logs, and real-time location data — usually without that person’s knowledge. Stalkerware apps, like Cocospy and its clones, are designed to stay hidden from device home screens, making the apps difficult to detect by their victims but all the while making the phone’s contents continually available to the person who planted the app. In February, a security researcher told TechCrunch that the apps share the same security flaw that allowed anyone to access the personal data of any device with one of the apps installed. The flaw also revealed the scale of the spying operations behind these apps by exposing the email address of every user who signed up to these spyware services with the intention of planting the spyware on someone’s phone. The researcher used the bug to scrape 3.2 million email addresses of Cocospy, Spyic, and Spyzie customers who had signed up and provided those email addresses to thedata breach notification site Have I Been Pwned. Following our reporting on the breach, the stalkerware apps have since stopped working, their websites disappeared, andtheir Amazon-hosted cloud storage was deleted, TechCrunch has found. It’s not clear for what reason the stalkerware operations were shuttered. The operators could not be reached for comment. Consumer-grade phone surveillance operations are known to shut down (or rebrand entirely) following a hack or data breach, typically in an effort to escape legal and reputational fallout. LetMeSpy, a spyware developed out of Poland, confirmedits “permanent shutdown”in August 2023 after a data breach wiped out the developer’s servers. U.S.-based spyware maker pcTattletalewent out of business and shut downin May 2024 following a hack andwebsite defacement. Cocospy, Spyic, and Spyzie are amongthe most recent apps in a growing list of dozens of phone surveillance operationsthat have been hacked or otherwise exposed their victims’ data as a result of shoddy coding or poor security practices. By TechCrunch’s count, at least 25 stalkerware operations have been breached since 2017, with at least 10 of those operations — including Cocospy — shutting down in the wake of a breach. Phone-monitoring apps like Cocospy are often sold under the guise of parental control or tracking software, but are also referred to as “stalkerware” (or spouseware) for their propensity to be misused — or explicitly marketed — for spying on a person’s spouse or partner without their consent, which is illegal. As such, stalkerware apps are banned from app stores and arenot allowed to advertise on search engines. Web hosts like Amazon, which hosted the stalkerware operations’ cache of stolen victims’ phone data, also claim to prohibit surveillance operations from using its platform. Although the trio of Cocospy apps now appears non-operational and its servers are offline, affected individuals should still take action to remove the spyware from their phones. To detect Cocospy, Spyic, and Spyzie on your Android phone, you can generally enter ✱✱001✱✱ on your phone app’s keypad and then press the “call” button.

On Monday during its Build 2025 conference, Microsoft announced Windows AI Foundry, a rebranding and expansion of theWindows Copilot Runtimeservice the company launched last May. Microsoft describes Windows AI Foundry as a “unified platform for local AI development” — a way to fine-tune, optimize, and deploy the AI models underpinning Windows apps. Microsoft increasingly sees AI, whether running locally or in the cloud, as a major profit driver, despite thehigh costsassociated with developing tentpole models. In January, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the tech giant has$13 billion in annualized AI revenue, in part thanks to its partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Microsoft might not profit directly from third-party AI-powered apps on Windows. Still, by providing resources to make it easier to build AI software on the tech giant’s flagship operating system, Microsoft aims to foster a flourishing ecosystem at the expense of rivals. Hence, Windows AI Foundry. According to a press release shared with TechCrunch, Windows AI Foundry can automatically detect a Windows machine’s hardware and fetch the necessary software components to run a particular AI model. Windows AI Foundry will also keep these components up to date as new devices are released, Microsoft says, and deliver tools designed to simplify the process of prepping models. Windows AI Foundry also includes Foundry Local, a new service that “bring[s] the power of [AI] models […] to client devices,” explains Microsoft in the press release. Foundry Local, which supports macOS in addition to Windows, comes with a set of modules to run AI models and tools directly on-device, leveraging the ONXX Runtime, an open source project aimed at accelerating AI across platforms. Foundry Local also ships with command-line interface support, letting developers use prompts like “Foundry model list, Foundry model run” to browse, test, and interact with models running on a local server. “Foundry Local will automatically detect device hardware — CPU, GPU, andNPU— and list compatible models for developers to try,” Microsoft writes. “Developers will be able to leverage the Foundry Local SDK to easily integrate Foundry Local in their app.” Topics AI Editor Experts from OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere deliver exclusive insights across a must-attend industry event that you can attend for just $292.

Microsoft appears to think so. At the company’s Build 2025 conference on Monday, Microsoft announced Microsoft Discovery, a platform that taps agentic AI to “transform the [scientific] discovery process,” according to a press release provided to TechCrunch. Microsoft Discovery is “extensible,” Microsoft says, and can handle certain science-related workloads “end-to-end.” “Microsoft Discovery is an enterprise agentic platform that helps accelerate research and discovery by transforming the entire discovery process with agentic AI — from scientific knowledge reasoning to hypothesis formulation, candidate generation, and simulation and analysis,” explains Microsoft in its release. “The platform enables scientists and researchers to collaborate with a team of specialized AI agents to help drive scientific outcomes with speed, scale, and accuracy using the latest innovations in AI and supercomputing.” Microsoft is one among many AI labs bullish on AI for science. Earlier this year, Google unveiled an “AI co-scientist,” which the tech giant said could help scientists with creating hypotheses and research plans. Anthropic and its chief rival, OpenAI, along with outfits likeFutureHouseand Lila Sciences, haveassertedthat AI tools could massively accelerate scientific discovery, particularly inmedicine. But many researchers don’t consider AI today to be especially useful inguiding the scientific process, largely due to itsunreliability. Part of the challenge in developing an “AI scientist” is anticipating an untold number of confounding factors. AI might come in handy in areas where broad exploration is needed, like narrowing down a vast list of possibilities, but it’s less clear whether it can do the kind of out-of-the-box problem-solving that leads to bona fide breakthroughs.Results from AI systems designed for science have so far been mostly underwhelming. In 2023, Google said around 40 new materials had beensynthesizedwith the help of one of its AIs, called GNoME. Butan outside analysisfound not even one of those materials was, in fact, new.

Announced at Build 2025, NLWeb lets websites provide a “conversational interface” — i.e. a text field and a submission button — for their users with a few lines of code, the AI model of their choice, and their own data. A retailer could use NLWeb to create a chatbot that helps users choose clothing for specific trips, for example, while a cooking site could use it to build a bot that suggests dishes to pair with a recipe.

Unveiled at Build 2025, the AI APIs mirror some of the functionality in Google Chrome, which also offers “built-in AI” that developers can tap to power their web applications. Microsoft’s move suggests that it’s keen to offer a competitor — one that might sway devs to its side. Edge’s new APIs give websites and Edge browser extensions access to Phi 4 mini, an AI model that Microsoft released in late February. Around 3.8 billion parameters in size, Phi 4 mini excels at math problems, Microsoft says, thanks to a training dataset that includes a mix of human-crafted and synthetic data (i.e. data generated by AI models). Parameters roughly correspond to a model’s problem-solving skills, and models with more parameters generally perform better than those with fewer parameters. Small models have the advantage of being more efficient, however, particularly on less powerful hardware like that found in laptops and mobile devices. Edge is also gaining other AI APIs, including a set of writing assistance APIs for generating, summarizing, and editing text. In a few months, Microsoft plans to release a translator API to serve AI-powered language translations via Edge, the company says. “These experimental APIs are intended as potential web standards and will work across platforms, browsers, and with other AI models,” writes Microsoft in a press release provided to TechCrunch. “For developers dealing with sensitive data or working in regulated industries, these APIs offer the privacy and security of on-device processing, eliminating the need to send data to external cloud services.” All of the new AI APIs are available in the Edge Canary and Dev channels. In related news, Microsoft is bringing a translation tool for PDFs to Edge. With support for over 70 languages, the tool lets users open a PDF in Edge, click the “Translate” icon in the Edge address bar, and create a new doc translated into the language of their choice.

The announcement, which was made at Microsoft’s Build 2025 conference on Monday, comes as MCP gains steam in the AI industry. Earlier this year, bothOpenAIandGooglesaid they would support MCP in their respective AI products. MCP lets models draw data from sources like business tools and software to complete tasks, as well as from content repositories and app development environments. The protocol enables developers to build two-way connections between data sources and AI-powered applications, such as chatbots. Developers can expose data through “MCP servers” and build “MCP clients” — for instance, apps and workflows — that connect to those servers on command. Microsoft and GitHub say that they’ll deliver “broad first-party support” for MCP across their platforms and services, including Microsoft Azure and Windows 11. For example, in the next few months, Windows will gain MCP integrations that allow developers to expose the functionality of apps to MCP-enabled models. “Developers will be able to wrap desired features and capabilities in their apps as MCP servers and make them available […] for Windows,” explains Microsoft in press materials provided to TechCrunch. “This will include Windows system functionalities like File System, Windowing, and Windows Subsystem for Linux as MCP servers for [models] to interact with.” GitHub and Microsoft are also making several contributions to the MCP standard. Microsoft says that its identity and security teams collaborated with Anthropic, the MCP steering committee, and the broader MCP community to design an updated authorization spec that allows MCP-connected apps to more securely connect to MCP servers. The spec enables people to use “trusted sign-in methods” to give AI-powered apps access to data and services including personal storage drives and subscription plans. Meanwhile, GitHub says that it and the MCP steering committee collaborated to design a registry service for MCP servers. The service allows developers to implement public or private centralized repositories for MCP server entries and enable the discovery and management of various MCP implementations with their associated configurations.

Still, the US president has not lost his sense of optimism about the prospect for peace, posting on social media that the combatants would \"immediately start\" negotiations for a ceasefire and an end to the war. That sentiment was somewhat at odds with the Russian view. Putin only said that his country is ready to work with Ukraine to craft a \"memorandum on a possible future peace agreement\". Talks about memorandums and a \"possible future\" of peace hardly seems the kind of solid ground on which lasting deals can be quickly built. Putin again emphasised that any resolution would have to address the \"root causes\" of the war – which Russia has claimed in the past to be Ukraine's desire for closer ties to Europe. On Truth Social after the call, Trump said that Russia and Ukraine will \"immediately start negotiations\" toward a ceasefire, adding that \"the conditions for that will be negotiated between the two parties\". But there is a possibility that Trump's latest take on the war in Ukraine could be a sign that the US will ultimately abandon the negotiating table. Later on Monday, Trump said he would not step away from brokering talks between the two countries, but acknowledged that he had a \"red line in his head\". \"Big egos involved, but I think something's going to happen,\" he said. \"And if it doesn't, I'll just back away and they'll have to keep going.\" Such a move, however, comes with its own set of questions – and risks. If the US washes its hands of the war, as Vice-President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have also threatened, does it mean the US would also end any military and intelligence support for Ukraine? And if that is the case, then it may be a development that Russia, with its greater resources compared to a Ukraine cut off from American backing,would welcome. That prospect is enough to have Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky concerned. \"It's crucial for all of us that the United States does not distance itself from the talks and the pursuit of peace,\" he said on Monday after the Trump-Putin call. Trump has expressed frustration with both Putin and Zelensky as efforts to resolve the three-year-old conflict drag on. He accused the Ukrainian leader of \"gambling with World War Three\" in an explosive meeting in February in the Oval Office and, in April, said he was \"very angry\" and \"pissed off\" at Putin after talks continued to stall. Putting aside Monday's rhetoric, it appears that Ukraine and Russia are set to continue some kind of talks – and talking in any form is progress after nearly three years of war. Still to be determined is whether the Russian team will be more than the low-level delegation that travelled to Istanbul to meet with the Ukrainians last Friday. Trump is holding out the promise of reduced sanctions on Russia – and new trade deals and economic investment – as the enticement that will move Putin toward a peace agreement. He mentioned that again in his post-call comments. Not discussed, on the other hand, were any negative consequences, such as new sanctions on Russian banking and energy exports. The US president last month warned that he would not tolerate Putin \"tapping me along\" and said that Russia should not target civilian areas. But yesterday, Russia launched its largest drone strike of the war on Ukrainian cities, and Monday's call between the two world leaders makes clear that any ceasefire or peace deal still seems well over the horizon.

    "title": "Post Office data breach victims to get compensation",
    "article_text": "The Post Office has agreed compensationfor hundreds of former sub-postmasters after accidentally leaking their names and addresses on its corporate website. The data breach was revealed in June last yearwhen it emerged the personal details of 555 victims of the Horizon IT scandal had been published. The company has now confirmed individual payouts of up to £5,000 with the potential for higher sums for those who want to pursue a further claim. The Post Office has already apologised and said it was working in \"full co-operation\" with the Information Commissioner's Office. The sub-postmasters' details were published in a document on its website. At the time, then-Post Office chief executive Nick Read said the leak was a \"truly terrible error\". The law firm Freeths, which acted for the 555 sub-postmasters when they sued the Post Office in a landmark High Court case in 2017, said it had secured the payouts on behalf of all those affected and their legal representatives. Of the 420 victims Freeths represents in the ongoing and separate battle for compensation from the scandal, 348 have already received payoutsfor the breach. Former sub-postmaster Chris Head welcomed the Post Office admitting the data breach mistake, but said they took \"far too long to right this wrong\". \"We cannot underestimate the level of pain, anxiety, stress and worry that so many people have had to suffer through this new episode. Post Office did not seem to understand how much this impacted those people. They appeared unwilling to engage in genuine discussions until further action was on the table. \"The impact on myself and my family has been profound on top of an already traumatic past 10 years due to the Horizon scandal.\" The Post Office said victims would be paid either £5,000 or £3,500, depending on whether the individual was also living at the address at the time. In a statement it also confirmed it would consider any special cases if individuals believe they are entitled to further amounts. \"We have written to all named individuals either directly, or via their solicitors. If there are any individuals whose name was impacted by last year's breach, but who have not received information about the payment for some reason, they can contact us or ask their solicitors if they have legal representation,\" it said. The lawyer who led the case on behalf of the sub-postmasters said the agreement was struck without the need for any claims to be submitted but also allowed victims the opportunity to pursue further action. \"We welcome the progress we have made with this case but there is still a long way to go to recognise the devastating impact of this breach for those affected,\" said Will Richmond-Coggan, Freeths' partner specialising in data breach litigation. Former sub-postmaster Bob Stevenson says he lost his home and business in the Horizon scandal. Newcastle Building Society says it has provided funds to Philips Trust Corporation's administrators. Not owning crucial code has meant it has been unable to replace the system that led to a scandal. A councillor says the organisation needs to \"get their fingers out\" to sort a replacement quickly.",

    "title": "My AI therapist got me through dark times: The good and bad of chatbot counselling",
    "article_text": "\"Whenever I was struggling, if it was going to be a really bad day, I could then start to chat to one of these bots, and it was like [having] a cheerleader, someone who's going to give you some good vibes for the day. \"I've got this encouraging external voice going – 'right - what are we going to do [today]?' Like an imaginary friend, essentially.\" For months, Kelly spent up to three hours a day speaking to online \"chatbots\" created using artificial intelligence (AI), exchanging hundreds of messages. At the time, Kelly was on a waiting list for traditional NHS talking therapy to discuss issues with anxiety, low self-esteem and a relationship breakdown. She says interacting with chatbots on character.ai got her through a really dark period, as they gave her coping strategies and were available for 24 hours a day. \"I'm not from an openly emotional family - if you had a problem, you just got on with it. \"The fact that this is not a real person is so much easier to handle.\" During May, the BBC is sharing stories and tips on how to support your mental health and wellbeing. Visit bbc.co.uk/mentalwellbeing to find out more People around the world have shared their private thoughts and experiences with AI chatbots, even though they are widely acknowledged as inferior to seeking professional advice. Character.ai itself tells its users: \"This is an AI chatbot and not a real person. Treat everything it says as fiction. What is said should not be relied upon as fact or advice.\" But in extreme examples chatbots have been accused of giving harmful advice. Character.ai is currently the subject of legal action from a mother whose 14-year-old son took his own life after reportedly becoming obsessed with one of its AI characters. According to transcripts of their chats in court filings he discussed ending his life with the chatbot. In a final conversation he told the chatbot he was \"coming home\" - and it allegedly encouraged him to do so \"as soon as possible\". Character.ai has denied the suit's allegations. And in 2023, the National Eating Disorder Association replaced its live helpline with a chatbot, but later had to suspend it over claims the bot was recommending calorie restriction. In April 2024 alone, nearly 426,000 mental health referrals were made in England - a rise of 40% in five years. An estimated one million people are also waiting to access mental health services, and private therapy can be prohibitively expensive (costs vary greatly, but the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy reports on average people spend £40 to £50 an hour). At the same time, AI has revolutionised healthcare in many ways, including helping to screen, diagnose and triage patients. There is a huge spectrum of chatbots, and about 30 local NHS services now use one called Wysa. Experts express concerns about chatbots around potential biases and limitations, lack of safeguarding and the security of users' information. But some believe that if specialist human help is not easily available, chatbots can be a help. So with NHS mental health waitlists at record highs, are chatbots a possible solution? Character.ai and other bots such as Chat GPT are based on \"large language models\" of artificial intelligence. These are trained on vast amounts of data – whether that's websites, articles, books or blog posts - to predict the next word in a sequence. From here, they predict and generate human-like text and interactions. The way mental health chatbots are created varies, but they can be trained in practices such as cognitive behavioural therapy, which helps users to explore how to reframe their thoughts and actions. They can also adapt to the end user's preferences and feedback. Hamed Haddadi, professor of human-centred systems at Imperial College London, likens these chatbots to an \"inexperienced therapist\", and points out that humans with decades of experience will be able to engage and \"read\" their patient based on many things, while bots are forced to go on text alone. \"They [therapists] look at various other clues from your clothes and your behaviour and your actions and the way you look and your body language and all of that. And it's very difficult to embed these things in chatbots.\" Another potential problem, says Prof Haddadi, is that chatbots can be trained to keep you engaged, and to be supportive, \"so even if you say harmful content, it will probably cooperate with you\". This is sometimes referred to as a 'Yes Man' issue, in that they are often very agreeable. And as with other forms of AI, biases can be inherent in the model because they reflect the prejudices of the data they are trained on. Prof Haddadi points out counsellors and psychologists don't tend to keep transcripts from their patient interactions, so chatbots don't have many \"real-life\" sessions to train from. Therefore, he says they are not likely to have enough training data, and what they do access may have biases built into it which are highly situational. \"Based on where you get your training data from, your situation will completely change. \"Even in the restricted geographic area of London, a psychiatrist who is used to dealing with patients in Chelsea might really struggle to open a new office in Peckham dealing with those issues, because he or she just doesn't have enough training data with those users,\" he says. Philosopher Dr Paula Boddington, who has written a textbook on AI Ethics, agrees that in-built biases are a problem. \"A big issue would be any biases or underlying assumptions built into the therapy model.\" \"Biases include general models of what constitutes mental health and good functioning in daily life, such as independence, autonomy, relationships with others,\" she says. Lack of cultural context is another issue – Dr Boddington cites an example of how she was living in Australia when Princess Diana died, and people did not understand why she was upset. \"These kinds of things really make me wonder about the human connection that is so often needed in counselling,\" she says. \"Sometimes just being there with someone is all that is needed, but that is of course only achieved by someone who is also an embodied, living, breathing human being.\" Kelly ultimately started to find responses the chatbot gave unsatisfying. \"Sometimes you get a bit frustrated. If they don't know how to deal with something, they'll just sort of say the same sentence, and you realise there's not really anywhere to go with it.\" At times \"it was like hitting a brick wall\". \"It would be relationship things that I'd probably previously gone into, but I guess I hadn't used the right phrasing […] and it just didn't want to get in depth.\" A Character.AI spokesperson said \"for any Characters created by users with the words 'psychologist', 'therapist,' 'doctor,' or other similar terms in their names, we have language making it clear that users should not rely on these Characters for any type of professional advice\". For some users chatbots have been invaluable when they have been at their lowest. Nicholas has autism, anxiety, OCD, and says he has always experienced depression. He found face-to-face support dried up once he reached adulthood: \"When you turn 18, it's as if support pretty much stops, so I haven't seen an actual human therapist in years.\" He tried to take his own life last autumn, and since then he says he has been on a NHS waitlist. \"My partner and I have been up to the doctor's surgery a few times, to try to get it [talking therapy] quicker. The GP has put in a referral [to see a human counsellor] but I haven't even had a letter off the mental health service where I live.\" While Nicholas is chasing in-person support, he has found using Wysa has some benefits. \"As someone with autism, I'm not particularly great with interaction in person. [I find] speaking to a computer is much better.\" The app allows patients to self-refer for mental health support, and offers tools and coping strategies such as a chat function, breathing exercises and guided meditation while they wait to be seen by a human therapist, and can also be used as a standalone self-help tool. Wysa stresses that its service is designed for people experiencing low mood, stress or anxiety rather than abuse and severe mental health conditions. It has in-built crisis and escalation pathways whereby users are signposted to helplines or can send for help directly if they show signs of self-harm or suicidal ideation. For people with suicidal thoughts, human counsellors on the free Samaritans helpline are available 24/7. Nicholas also experiences sleep deprivation, so finds it helpful if support is available at times when friends and family are asleep. \"There was one time in the night when I was feeling really down. I messaged the app and said 'I don't know if I want to be here anymore.' It came back saying 'Nick, you are valued. People love you'. \"It was so empathetic, it gave a response that you'd think was from a human that you've known for years […] And it did make me feel valued.\" His experiences chime with a recent study by Dartmouth College researchers looking at the impact of chatbots on people diagnosed with anxiety, depression or an eating disorder, versus a control group with the same conditions. After four weeks, bot users showed significant reductions in their symptoms – including a 51% reduction in depressive symptoms - and reported a level of trust and collaboration akin to a human therapist. Despite this, the study's senior author commented there is no replacement for in-person care. Aside from the debate around the value of their advice, there are also wider concerns about security and privacy, and whether the technology could be monetised. \"There's that little niggle of doubt that says, 'oh, what if someone takes the things that you're saying in therapy and then tries to blackmail you with them?',\" says Kelly. Psychologist Ian MacRae specialises in emerging technologies, and warns \"some people are placing a lot of trust in these [bots] without it being necessarily earned\". \"Personally, I would never put any of my personal information, especially health, psychological information, into one of these large language models that's just hoovering up an absolute tonne of data, and you're not entirely sure how it's being used, what you're consenting to.\" \"It's not to say in the future, there couldn't be tools like this that are private, well tested […] but I just don't think we're in the place yet where we have any of that evidence to show that a general purpose chatbot can be a good therapist,\" Mr MacRae says. Wysa's managing director, John Tench, says Wysa does not collect any personally identifiable information, and users are not required to register or share personal data to use Wysa. \"Conversation data may occasionally be reviewed in anonymised form to help improve the quality of Wysa's AI responses, but no information that could identify a user is collected or stored. In addition, Wysa has data processing agreements in place with external AI providers to ensure that no user conversations are used to train third-party large language models.\" Kelly feels chatbots cannot currently fully replace a human therapist. \"It's a wild roulette out there in AI world, you don't really know what you're getting.\" \"AI support can be a helpful first step, but it's not a substitute for professional care,\" agrees Mr Tench. And the public are largely unconvinced. A YouGov survey found just 12% of the public think AI chatbots would make a good therapist. But with the right safeguards, some feel chatbots could be a useful stopgap in an overloaded mental health system. John, who has an anxiety disorder, says he has been on the waitlist for a human therapist for nine months. He has been using Wysa two or three times a week. \"There is not a lot of help out there at the moment, so you clutch at straws.\" \"[It] is a stop gap to these huge waiting lists… to get people a tool while they are waiting to talk to a healthcare professional.\" If you have been affected by any of the issues in this story you can find information and support on theBBC Actionline website here.

    "article_text": "The Trump administration has agreed to pay a $5m (£3.7m) settlement to the family of Ashli Babbitt, a US Air Force veteran who was shot and killed by a Capitol police officer while breaching the US Congress on 6 January 2021. Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger told CBS, the BBC's US partner, he is \"extremely disappointed\" with the decision. The officer involved in her shooting has been cleared of any wrongdoing. The settlement resolves a $30m wrongful death suit filed by Babbitt's family and the conservative activist group Judicial Watch. Thousands of Trump supporters descended on the US Capitol on 6 January in an attempt to halt the certification of Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 election. Babbitt was part of a group that smashed windows in an effort to enter the chamber of the House of Representatives while it was still in session, forcing lawmakers to delay certification and flee for safety. Video of the incident shows her being shot in the shoulder after attempting to climb through a door. She later died in hospital. The wrongful death lawsuit filed by Babbitt's family claimed that the decision to open fire by Capitol Police officer Michael Byrd was negligent, and that Babbitt's hands were in the air when she was shot. Family members say that Babbitt was motivated to come to the Capitol by Trump's claims of election fraud. No evidence has ever surfaced of widespread fraud in the 2020 election. Mr Byrd previously defended the move to fire his gun, saying the group of lawmakers and security \"were essentially trapped\" and had \"no way to retreat\". In August 2021, a Capitol Police review found that Mr Byrd's decision saved lives and was consistent with police training and procedures. A justice department review also found no evidence of any police wrongdoing. \"This is extremely disappointing and I completely disagree with the Department of Justice's decision,\" Chief Manger said in a statement to staff after learning of the settlement, the Washington Post reported. \"This settlement sends a chilling message to law enforcement officers across our nation - especially those who have a protective mission like ours,\" he added. In January, on his first day back in the White House, President Donald Trump issued a blanket pardon for more than 1,500 Capitol riot defendants, including hundreds accused of assaulting police. He also fired the federal prosecutors who handled those cases. Trump in March told conservative news outlet Newsmax that he's \"a big fan of Ashli Babbitt\" and that she was \"innocently standing there\" when she was shot. \"And a man did something unthinkable to her when he shot her, and I think it's a disgrace,\" he said, promising to \"look into\" the lawsuit brought by her family.

    "article_text": "The Met Office has unveiled a new supercomputer which it says produces better forecasts. The weather agency says detailed estimates up to 14 days in advance will become the norm, while rainfall predictions will also be more accurate. The new cloud-based system, which was launched on Monday, can perform 60 quadrillion calculations per second. It is being operated by Microsoft's cloud-based Azure, making it the first system the Met Office is not running by itself. And it ends a long wait for the weather prediction tech,which was first announced in 2020and originally slated for 2022. According to the Met Office, this is the world's first cloud-based supercomputer dedicated to weather and climate science. It said one of the benefits of the tech will be improving forecasting at airports, while it could also give the energy sector more detailed information to help it plan for potential blackouts and surges. And it said the supercomputer, which is entirely powered by renewable energy, will also improve predications on ongoing challenges caused by climate change, such as flooding and wildfires. The new supercomputer, which can perform more than four times the number of calculations per second than its predecessor, contains 1.8m core processors. While the exact location of the infrastructure is a secret, the Azure supercomputing service is physically located in the south of England and is split across two data centres. Afterrecent hacks of British institutionssuch as M&S and Co-op, cyber security is on \"everyone's thoughts\" according to the Met Office's chief information officer Charles Ewen. But he said he is happy with the security of the new system and is \"very confident this is a big enhancement\" on its predecessor. \"There's never been a more critical time for weather and climate intelligence,\" said Prof Simon Vosper, the Met Office's science director. \"We know the climate's changing, as we know the risks of hazardous weather. \"The supercomputer will unlock our ability to deliver those improved services where they're needed.\" In February 2020, the UK governmentpledged £1.2bn for the projectand said the old supercomputers would reach the end of their lives in 2022. Mr Ewen said the three-year delay was predominantly caused by the Covid pandemic and its impact on the availability of silicon, while the Met Office highlighted the need to keep delivering existing services during the changeover. \"I'm very confident the Met Office is best placed in the world to be able to accommodate at scale emerging methods and techniques such as artificial intelligence,\" he said.

    "title": "Fire chief took own life after harassment and questions over qualifications, inquest told",
    "article_text": "A fire chief took his own life because he \"couldn't take it any more\" after months of alleged harassment and questions over his qualifications, an inquest has heard. Wayne Brown, chief fire officer at West Midlands Fire Service (WMFS), wasfound dead at his flatin Birmingham by police on the morning of 24 January last year. Mr Brown had been under scrutiny from colleagues over claims he had lied on his CV. His partner, Nicola White, told the first day of the inquest on Monday that attention from the national press was the \"final straw\". Birmingham Coroners' Court heard that in the days before his death, aninternal investigationhad been launched at WMFS into a claim Mr Brown had lied about having an MBA (Master of Business Administration), a requirement for chief fire officers. Satinder Sahota, monitoring officer for WMFS, said Mr Brown, who had been in the role permanently since April 2023, admitted he had started an MBA but had not finished it and apologised for putting it on his CV. Ms White said her partner was clearly \"low\" about the ongoing investigation, but when a national news outlet ran a story about him, \"He just couldn't take it anymore. I said, 'Wayne, you need to speak to someone,' but he didn't like to show his weaknesses.\" She added: \"On the Tuesday... I did think to ask him, 'You're not going to do anything silly, are you?' But I put that thought immediately out of my head because I thought he would never do that.\" Ms White said her partner did say that he felt supported by the fire service. However, Mr Sahota said Mr Brown was a \"private and stoic\" man who did not seek the support from occupational health colleagues that he was urged to take during their meetings. On one occasion, days before he died, Mr Brown told Mr Sahota that he was feeling under pressure, was exhausted, was struggling to sleep and had \"racing thoughts\". Mr Sahota told the inquest: \"My view at the time was that he was saying he was okay. I urged him to reach out to occupational health. \"I had to be careful with Wayne... I didn't want to annoy him; it was quite clear he was private, and he was the most senior person in the organisation, and I didn't want to be disrespectful of that because it would affect my relationship with him going forward.\" Deputy fire chief Joanne Bowcock said in a statement that she recognised Mr Brown was under pressure but that she never considered he would take his own life. And added he appeared to be coping well, but when speaking to him on 18 January, he told her he had had \"the worst two weeks of his life\" and feared he would be suspended. Det Ch Insp Jonathan Kiteley of West Midlands Police told the court Mr Brown was also \"frustrated\" that a court date for a man charged with harassing him had been pushed back. \"I had no idea he would go on to take his own life, but I could tell the constant barrage of contact was getting to him,\" said Mr Kiteley. The charges against the manwere droppedfollowing Mr Brown's death. Senior coroner Louise Hunt, who presided over the inquest, said Mr Brown had died as a result of suicide and indicated she would be writing a Prevention of Future Deaths report to WMFS to raise concerns. She said the fire service did not undertake any investigation following Mr Brown's death so lessons could be learnt and was concerned that there was no policy requiring them to do so. Mrs Hunt was also concerned that there appeared to be no mechanism for recording concerns raised about the welfare of staff during a fact-finding or formal investigation and that there was no provision in the service's health and wellbeing or mental health policy for employees as senior as Mr Brown was. In a tribute, Mr Brown's son Kai said he was \"loved and respected\", had many friends and was their \"shining star\". He said: \"We will be forever proud of him, and he leaves a void in our lives which will never be filled.\" The inquest continues. Follow BBC Birmingham onBBC Sounds,Facebook,XandInstagram.

    "title": "What will 'reset' deal mean for UK economic growth?",
    "article_text": "There was much fanfare  - and then lunch on the Thames - to mark the \"reset\" of the relationship between the UK and the EU with claims of a \"huge\" potential boost to growth. The deal does represent a  significant breakthrough in deepening ties in the UK's most important trading relationship and paves the way for more gains while still allowing scope for pursuing other trade deals. But ultimately what has been agreed so far only dismantles a fraction of the trade barriers erected post-Brexit. Those producing and selling foodstuffs between Britain and the EU, in particular, are celebrating a reduction in red tape and checks. The agreement on plant and animal health, or sanitary and phytosanitary standards (SPS), goes further than envisaged a few months ago. By agreeing to follow EU rules, the government has faced accusations of selling out on sovereignty. But it will smooth the path for over 1,500 products crossing borders. For more than four years, those selling agricultural products from Britain to the EU have had to comply with extra certification and checks, intended to prevent the spread of disease and ensure food safety. Amid frequent complaints of forms stretching to dozens of pages and fish and other perishables rotting in transit, the Food & Drink Federation claims that exports of such items to the EU have dropped by a third since 2019. Small companies were particularly likely to conclude it wasn't worth the effort; the variety of products being exported was reduced as costs increased. Formalities on items coming into the UK, too, have been ramped up, albeit more gradually. By doing away with some of the paperwork and inspections, the government claims this agreement - and the one centred on energy - will be worth £8.9bn to the UK by 2040. Those predictions are always uncertain but that's roughly equivalent to 0.3% of GDP - helpful but not quite the \"huge\" boost to growth it claims. And that would recoup only a small  fraction of the 4% of GDP the government's own independent forecasters reckon has been foregone as a result of  Brexit. Some studies suggest that greater red tape has contributed to higher prices for foodstuffs imported from the EU in recent years. And while retailers are among those welcoming this deal, it's not guaranteed that any savings in costs will be passed on, although the deal could limit the degree of future increases in the price of - that depends on suppliers passing on savings. The key concession made by the UK was an extension to the agreement on fisheries by 12 years. That sector represents just 0.04% of GDP, but clearly this will be a big disappointment to some fishing communities, concerned by an encroachment of rights. However, exports of fish to the EU have fallen by 29% over the course of just a few  years - the SPS agreement is likely to help reverse that loss. What's been agreed in detail so far may not provide the \"huge\" boost to growth the government wants, but there is more that should be ahead. The youth mobility scheme could deliver significant gains, depending on the details that are hammered out, as could the mutual recognition of professional qualifications. But even those are unlikely to repair even the majority of the damage to growth some economists reckon Brexit has caused. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility, the official forecasters, had reckoned that as a result of Brexit GDP will be the equivalent of 4% lower than it could have been. That's the equivalent of costing the economy £100bn per year. Fully compensating for that, analysts reckon, would involve the UK rejoining the single market and customs union and allowing freedom of movement - all of which the government reiterated today are \"red lines\" it's not prepared to cross. But there is still a very significant triumph the government can claim. In a short period of time, it has tied up trade agreements with India and the US - and struck this improved deal with the EU. The latter, in particular, may have been given added impetus by President Trump's trade hostility. Knowing it perhaps could rely less on that traditional ally across the Atlantic may not have driven the EU and UK into each others arms, but it likely added a new focus on working to break down barriers previously thought insurmountable. Moreover, the UK has achieved something many commentators thought not possible in the early years of Brexit, securing a deal (albeit limited) with the US without lowering food standards and so managing to align with EU rules. This deal may not be a huge growth gamechanger. But it paves the way for reaching more common ground with the EU while allowing the UK to strengthen ties with the US on services, in particular financial services, and technology - areas of growing importance for British firms doing business with America. And that strategic focus on building on our economic strength is not to be sniffed at, particularly at a time of geopolitical uncertainty \"Fear managed to defeat fury\" is how one analyst interpreted liberal Nicusor Dan beating hard-right George Simion to the presidency. A deal between the UK and European Union (EU) has been agreed at a post-Brexit leaders summit in London. A youth visa scheme and how much the UK will contribute financially are among issues still being negotiated It comes after Sir Keir Starmer says his government has struck a post-Brexit agreement with the EU. The two sides have struck a new post-Brexit deal but this so-called 'reset' of the relationship is just the beginning.",

    "title": "UK-EU deal moves us on from Brexit rows, Starmer says",
    "article_text": "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said it is time to move on from \"political fights\" about Brexit, as the UK and the European Union agreed to a major reset of relations. The UK and the EU have struck a deal that covers fishing, trade, defence, energy and strengthening ties in a number of policy areas still up for negotiation. A key part of the deal involves giving European fishing boats a further 12 years of access to British waters in exchange for easing some trade frictions. It marks the biggest reboot since the UK officially left the EU in 2020 and comes after years of disagreements over Brexit. The Conservatives and Reform UK have described the deal as a \"surrender\" to the EU, while the Liberal Democrats said the government had taken some \"positive first steps\" to rebuilding ties with Europe. The agreement was finalised late on Sunday, ahead of a summit involving EU chiefs Ursula von der Leyen and Antonio Costa in London on Monday. \"It's time to look forward,\" Sir Keir said at the summit. \"To move on from the stale old debates and political fights to find common sense, practical solutions which get the best for the British people. \"We're ready to work with partners if it means we can improve people's lives here at home.\" At a news conference, European Commission President von der Leyen described the summit as a \"historic moment\" that was only possible \"thanks to the leadership\" of Sir Keir. \"We're turning a page,\" she said. \"We're opening a new chapter in our relationship.\" The president said the deal would make \"a real difference to people in the UK and across our union\" at a time of global instability. The government said the deal would make it easier for food and drink to be imported and exported by reducing paperwork and checks. Some routine checks on animal and plant products will be removed completely, the government said. In return, the UK will give the EU access to its fishing waters until 2038 - a 12-year extension of arrangements already in place. One diplomatic source said it amounted to a rollover of the existing terms agreed as part of the revised withdrawal agreement negotiated by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government in 2019. The text of the deal says: \"We note the political agreements leading to full reciprocal access to waters to fish until 30 June 2038 and extending energy cooperation on a continuous basis.\" The post-Brexit deal on fishing rights, which gave EU boats continued access to UK waters, was set to expire at the end of June 2026. The UK government has also unveiled a £360m investment fund in coastal communities and the fishing industry. Fishing only accounts for an estimated 0.04% of UK GDP, but British control over its fishing waters was a big issue in the Brexit campaign. Defending the agreement, Sir Keir said it would allow British fishing communities to \"sell more easily into the European market\" and give them \"stability over the long term\". Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said the 12-year deal on access for European boats \"will be the end of the fishing industry\". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the prime minister \"must ignore the naysayers and dinosaurs in Reform and the Conservative Party and be more ambitious in getting the best deal in the national interest\". Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said giving the EU access to British waters for 12 years \"was three times longer than the government wanted\". \"We're becoming a rule-taker from Brussels once again,\" she said. The deal requires the UK to follow rules set by Brussels in areas covering food trade, emissions trading and potential co-operation in the electricity market. Known as dynamic alignment, this arrangement would mean the UK giving the European Court of Justice a role in any trading disputes. Ina post on X, Johnson said under this \"sell out of a deal the UK will have to accept EU law on a host of measures from food standards to emissions trading\". He said Sir Keir had agreed that the UK \"will once again be paying countless millions of pounds into EU coffers - for the privilege of becoming the non-voting punk of the EU Commission\". The prime minister's spokesperson said payments to the EU in relation to the deals on agricultural products and energy were \"not big\", but not did confirm the costs. The government said there was a difference between these \"administrative costs\" and the payments required to be part of EU programmes, which would be part of future negotiations. A security pact is also central to the agreement, as European nations come under pressure to invest more in defence to support Ukraine as it faces Russia's full-scale invasion. The agreement paves the way for the UK to participate in the EU's proposed new £150bn defence fund, opening up opportunities for UK arms firms to bid for defence contracts. The government said British businesses will not be hit by an EU carbon tax due to come in next year, under plans to link emissions-trading schemes. The agreements on trade and energy would add nearly £9bn to the UK economy by 2040, the government estimated. Other announcements include: The reset comes after years of ill-tempered relations between the UK and the EU over Brexit, which triggered one of the most tumultuous periods in British political history. Since Labour took office last year, governments worldwide have been forced to rethink their relationships on trade and defence, in response to US President Donald Trump's policies and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Ministers believe there is no public clamour to reopen the biggest questions of Brexit – membership of the single market and customs union. Polling by YouGov suggests a majority of Britons now regret the Brexit vote and favour closer ties with the EU. But the Labour government's reset of EU relations comes at a time when Reform UK - a Eurosceptic party - is leading in the polls.

    "title": "What does the new EU deal mean for Scotland?",
    "article_text": "The new EU deal has been described in Scotland as both a \"betrayal\" and \"breakthrough\", and will affect businesses in different ways. The harshest criticism has come from the commercial sea fishing industry which has reacted angrily to a 12-year extension of the initial post-Brexit fishing agreement. But the clearing away of red tape could also benefit exports for others in the sector. So what does the new deal mean for Scotland? The previous post-Brexit deal saw the UK regain 25% of fishing rights from the EU, but it also gave European boats continued access to UK waters. It was due to expire at the end of June 2026 but the new agreement will see that extended until the summer of 2038. Elspeth Macdonald, who represents more than 400 fishing boats as chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, told BBC Scotland it was a \"total capitulation to the EU\". By agreeing to a multi-year deal, she argues, the UK has thrown away an important bargaining chip for future negotiations. Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes described it as a \"great betrayal\" of Scotland's fishing fleet. But the UK government claims the deal provides more certainty and stability going forward, and there will be no increase in the EU quota. Reduced bureaucracy could benefit west coast creel fisherman who sell directly into Europe and benefit from measures to reduce hold-ups for goods that perish quickly. Shellfish from some UK waters, currently banned in the EU, can be exported again under the deal. In an effort to address concerns from the fishing sector, the UK government has also announced a £360m fishing and coastal growth fund to invest in new technology, equipment and support for coastal communities. A new SPS agreement will make food and drink imports and exports between the UK and the EU easier. SPS stands for sanitary and phytosanitary, which refers to rules about animals and food. The deal will align UK food safety and animal health standards with those of the EU, meaning most routine checks on animal and plant products will be removed completely. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said it would reduce \"red tape\" for businesses and help cut lorry queues at the border. The UK government said this could lead to lower food prices and more choice on supermarket shelves. The deal also means that British farms will be able to sell sausages and burgers to the EU for the first time in five years. It would also return Scottish seed potatoes, once an important export, to the EU market after they were banned in 2021 in the wake of Brexit. President of the National Farmers Union (NFU) in Scotland Andrew Connon told BBC Scotland'sLunchtime Live programmehe was \"cautiously optimistic\". He said it would help the livestock sector, specifically beef and lamb producers, as well as the seed potato industry which had suffered in recent years. \"Since Brexit, there has been more restriction and more friction at borders with regards to exports,\" he said. \"The likes of the seed potato industry has been massively impacted. So anything that can reduce that friction has to be welcomed.\" But Mr Connon also said it was important that standards were not relaxed and the border was kept safe so not to undermine British markets. Tavish Scott, chief executive of Salmon Scotland, said the deal was \"very good news\" for fish farming. He said the EU was the \"most important market\" for Scottish salmon, with France alone taking about £240m of it every year. Mr Scott said the sector had faced \"considerable\" costs for administration to export salmon and delivery time had increased due to physical checks on products. He added: \"These measures could reduce the bureaucratic cost of the administration we currently face, at about £3m a year. \"It will also improve our delivery times to our customers all over Europe, which is very welcome given we're exporting a time-sensitive product directly from Scotland into the EU.\" UK Hospitality has praised the deal as \"positive news\" for the sector. Chief executive Kate Nicholls said it would help to \"further increase access to high-quality, affordable food and drink for business and consumers alike\". She also welcomed the UK government's commitment to working on a youth mobility deal. It's thought a new agreement on youth movement could increase the UK hospitality workforce aftersignificant staff shortages in the wake of the Covid pandemic and Brexit. The Scottish Hospitality Group also welcomed the deal as importing products from the EU was a \"big cost\" for the sector. Director Stephen Montgomery said the industry body would wait to read the whole document, however \"what we do know is that this will not go far enough to the help already struggling hospitality businesses\". He said businesses were still struggling with growing costs due to increased national insurance contributions and the \"out of date\" non-domestic rates policy. The UK-EU deal also includes the announcement of a new security and defence partnership. The prime minister said this would \"pave the way for the UK defence industry to participate in the EU's proposed new £150bn Security Action for Europe (SAFE) defence fund\". That will be welcomed by UK defence firms such as BAE Systems and Babcock which have a significant presence in Scotland, particularly in naval shipbuilding. The UK government also said the deal would benefit British steel as it would be protected from new EU rules and restrictive tariffs through a bespoke agreement. Scottish holidaymakers will soon be able to use more eGates in Europe, which the government says \"will end the dreaded queues\" at border control. Since Brexit, British travellers arriving at EU airports have mostly had to queue for manned desks to get their passports stamped, instead of using the automated gates. As part of the deal, \"pet passports\" will also be introduced for cats and dogs, so there will no longer be a need for animal health certificates on every trip. The UK and EU have also agreed to work together on a \"youth experience scheme\". This could mean young people, aged 18-30, might be able to travel and work freely within the European Union again. But the government said the youth scheme would be \"capped and time-limited\" and would be similar to ones the UK already has with countries like Australia and New Zealand. The UK has also agreed to work towards re-joining the Erasmus+ scheme, which would make it easier and more affordable for students to study abroad in the EU. A new UK-EU deal means the reversal of a ban on British-grown plants being sold in Northern Ireland. The deal covers defence, trade, fishing, and a possible youth scheme, in the first big reset since Brexit.

    "title": "New UK-EU deal long overdue, says garden centre owner",
    "article_text": "Thenew agri-food deal with the EUwill mean the reversal of a ban on British- grown plants being sold in Northern Ireland. Some common varieties have been prohibited since 2021 under the terms of Northern Ireland's original Brexit deal. That deal meant Northern Ireland continued to follow the EU's strict rules on plant health while the rest of the UK had its own rules. Underthe new deal the UK as a whole will realign with EU plant health rules,which will mean the ban can be dropped. Robin Mercer, from Hillmount Garden Centre in County Down, said the deal was \"long overdue\" as the current arrangements had driven up costs. \"In the past before Brexit we were bringing in trolley loads of roses every week, now we're having to source them from different places and there isn't the same selection,\" he said. \"There's a lot of suppliers in England that won't work with us now because it's too much hassle, too much paperwork.\" The Horticultural Trades Association (HTA) said the deal would help the industry across the UK, which has seen trade with European suppliers disrupted. Neil Grant, chair of the HTA's retailer committee, said: \"Garden centres and their customers have seen prices rise and choice reduced as a direct result the trade barriers we now have with European suppliers. \"We know of many retailers who report that inspection delays have led to damaged, unsalable stock, as well as staffing issues around ever-shifting delivery times, all of which add costs to garden centres across the UK. \"Lifting trade barriers should boost our range of plants and products and how quickly we can get them.\" The deal should also mean GB retailers resume online sales of plants and seeds to Northern Ireland. However the changes will not be implemented anytime soon and for NI businesses and consumers will not remove all the barriers which went up in 2021. Monday's deal is described as a \"political declaration\" which now has to be converted to a legally binding text. That will take months to negotiate and it is unlikely it will move to implementation before next year. In the meantime some requirements which the last government signed up to in 2023 Windsor Framework deal will continue to be implemented. For example a new phase of \"Not for EU\" labelling on GB food products being sold in NI will go ahead in July. That is despite the fact that labelling with ultimately be phased out as a result of the new deal. Most commercial goods being sold from GB to NI will also continue to require customs declarations, even the products which as covered by Monday's deal. Stuart Anderson, director of public affairs at Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce, said he remained concerned about the customs burden for movement between GB and NI. \"The customs issues have been in play since the original deal was introduced,\" he said. \"There has been some movement on that though the Windsor Framework – some of it creating perhaps more challenges too with the introduction of  parcel arrangements from May.\" However he said the new deal was \"hugely positive news\" on the face of it. He added that businesses in Northern Ireland had \"carried a significant amount of the burden in getting us to today\". Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced the wide-ranging agreement affecting food, fishing and security after hosting EU leaders at a summit in London. It includes a new SPS agreement - which stands for sanitary and phytosanitary and refers to rules about animals and food. The government said this would reduce red tape for businesses, simplify food exports and imports, and help cut lorry queues at borders. The deal also includes a new security and defence partnership between the UK and EU, and new arrangements for passport checks. British holidaymakers will soon be able to use more eGates in Europe, which the government said would \"end the dreaded queues\" at border control. Sir Keir said the deal would be \"good for jobs, good for bills and good for our borders\". However, critics accused the Labour government of betraying Brexit voters as the UK will have to follow EU agri-food rules without having a say in how those rules are made. There are also concerns about a 12-year fishing deal granting the EU access to UK waters, which is included as part of the overall agreement. Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch said the UK was \"becoming a rule-taker from Brussels once again\". But the Labour government said it was time to \"reset\" relations with the EU which is the UK's biggest market. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the UK's agricultural food exports were down by a fifth, and the new deal would reduce trade friction and costs.

    "title": "Who are the winners and losers from the UK-EU agreement?",
    "article_text": "A deal to \"reset\" relations between the UK and the EU following Brexit has been agreed at a summit in London. The agreement covers a range of issues, including defence, fishing, the trade in food products and the ability of young people to move freely between the UK and the EU. BBC Verify has gone through the deal, picking out the potential winners and losers. Winner: UK food exporters to the EU who could see fewer checks Loser: People who don't want the UK to follow EU rules, as there are strings attached Since Brexit, UK goods travelling to the EU – including food products – have faced new checks and extra paperwork. Some items, such as UK exports of raw burgers and sausages, have been banned from entering the EU because they do not meet its strict import rules. UK food exports to the EU have fallen– with volumes in 2024 down 34% compared with 2019 – and the industry blames this partly on the added red tape. Now, both sides have agreed to work on a joint food safety agreement that could remove many of the current barriers. If signed and fully implemented, it would reduce paperwork, ease checks, and could even lift bans on products like raw meats. Food and drink exports to the EU in 2023were worth £14bn, accounting for 57% of all the sector's overseas sales. But the deal comes with conditions. The UK will need to follow future EU food standards – a system known as \"dynamic alignment\" – and accept that the European Court of Justice will have the final say in any disputes in this area. The UK will be also required to make a financial contribution. However is it currently unknown how much the payment would be and when it would be required. Winner: The EU - fishing vessels get 12 more years of access to UK waters Loser: UK fishermen who wanted annual negotiations on fishing access Although fishing accounts for a very small part of the UK economy -just 0.04% of GDP in 2024- it is politically sensitive. The \"reset\" document notes \"political agreements leading to full reciprocal access to waters to fish until 30 June 2038\" - a 12-year extension to the current deal negotiated by Boris Johnson's Conservative government - and much longer than expected. Under the existing agreement (due to expire in 2026), EU vessels get access to UK waters to fish - in return for transferring 25% of their fishing quota - the amount they are allowed to catch - to UK fleets. Some UK fishing groups have criticised the existing deal and do not want to see it extended. Elspeth Macdonald, who represents 450 fishing boats as chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation says: \"This deal is a horror show for Scottish fishermen, far worse than Boris Johnson's botched Brexit agreement.\" She says the long-term deal takes away the industry's bargaining power in future talks and would prefer annual negotiations with the EU. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says there will be \"no increase in the amount that the EU vessels can catch in British waters\" and says it will now be easier for UK fishermen to export their products. In 2023, the UKexported £1.2bn of fish to the EU, around 70% of all fish exports. Tavish Scott from Salmon Scotland, which represents salmon farming in Scotland, says the agreement to reduce checks would \"speed up the delivery of our premium salmon to market\". Winner: Young people in the UK and EU who should - if this is confirmed - be able to work and study more freely between the two Loser: Those who oppose an increase in net migration to the UK will point out that any mobility scheme could affect immigration figures, although this effect may be temporary The details here are still to be confirmed, but the winners would be those young people from both the UK and EU who would be able to work and study more easily across Europe and Great Britain. Other youth mobility schemes have focused on people aged 18 to 30. However, the impact of what is being called a \"youth experience scheme\" could be uneven. Before Brexit more young people from the EU came to the UK than went the other way. And, remember, Sir Keir has pledged to \"significantly\" reduce immigration levels in the coming years. So there's a  big question mark on what impact a UK-EU scheme could have on UK immigration levels. Madeleine Sumption from Oxford University's Migration Observatory told BBC Verify that a scheme would likely increase net migration in the short term, as new participants arrive. However, she adds that if everyone left the UK when their visa expired, the long-term impact on migration levels would be minimal. \"If the UK is worried about the impact, it could phase in the scheme, where it gradually increases the quota. So as people leave, the quota could be raised rather than a big bang all come at once,\" she said. Winner: British tourists may be able to use eGates at EU airports but we do not know which ones and from when Loser: Those expecting to escape long queues this summer As part of the agreement, UK nationals will be able to use eGates at EU airports, rather than having their passport manually checked by a border officer. The government claims: \"British holidaymakers will be able to use more eGates in Europe, ending the dreaded queues at border control.\" However the text of the EU-UK agreement is less clear, only referring to the \"potential use of eGates where appropriate\". It is unlikely any change will be implemented by the summer, travel organisation Abta told BBC Verify. Abta believes the deal clarifies that the EU countries can offer eGates to UK nationals once a new Entry/Exit System (EES) comes into effect in October. EES is an automated IT system for registering all non-EU travellers for a short stay, each time they cross the EU's external borders. Whether UK passengers will avoid a border guard altogether will depend on the technology at each border crossing, Abta says. Winner: UK defence firms may get contracts from new EU rearmament fund Loser: EU defence firms which hoped to get more of these revenues The EU has established a Security Action for Europe fund (SAFE) with €150bn (£126bn) of loans, backed by the EU budget, to enable its member states to rearm. This was going to be spent on EU-based defence firms. The fund also allows for the involvement of a number of non-EU countries and could now be opened up to UK defence companies too. This would potentially allow EU firms to use the fund to buy kit from the UK. The UK has a large defence manufacturing industry relative to many EU states and this sector directlyemploys about164,00 peoplein the UK. Between 2020 and 2024, the UK wasestimated by the Stockholm International Peace Research Instituteto have accounted for around 3.6% of total global annual arms exports, making the UK the seventh largest national exporter. Again, the detail is still being worked out here and we do not know when and exactly how the UK will participate in the fund. What do you want BBC Verify to investigate? Eluned Morgan said she understood concerns, but that export capabilities would improve. The new agreement is set to affect sectors including fishing, agriculture, hospitality and defence. It comes after Sir Keir Starmer says his government has struck a post-Brexit agreement with the EU. The two sides have struck a new post-Brexit deal but this so-called 'reset' of the relationship is just the beginning. Some goods will be allowed \"to flow freely again\" between Northern Ireland and Great Britain as the result of a new UK-EU deal, the government has said.",

    "title": "Scientists in a race to discover why our Universe exists",
    "article_text": "Inside a laboratory nestled above the mist of the forests of South Dakota, scientists are searching for the answer to one of science's biggest questions: why does our Universe exist? They are in a race for the answer with a separate team of Japanese scientists – who are several years ahead. The current theory of how the Universe came into being can't explain the existence of the planets, stars and galaxies we see around us. Both teams are building detectors that study a sub-atomic particle called a neutrino in the hope of finding answers. The US-led international collaboration is hoping the answer lies deep underground, in the aptly named Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (Dune). The scientists will travel 1,500 metres below the surface into three vast underground caverns. Such is the scale that construction crews and their bulldozers seem like  small plastic toys by comparison. The science director of this facility, Dr Jaret Heise describes the giant caves as \"cathedrals to science\". Dr Heise has been involved the construction of these caverns at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (Surf) for nearly ten years. They seal Dune off from the noise and radiation from the world above. Now, Dune is now ready for the next stage. \"We are poised to build the detector that will change our understanding of the Universe with instruments that will be deployed by a collaboration of more than 1,400 scientists from 35 countries who are eager to answer the question of why we exist,\" he says. When the Universe was created two kinds of particles were created: matter – from which stars, planets and everything around us are made – and, in equal amounts, antimatter, matter's exact opposite. Theoretically the two should have cancelled each other out, leaving nothing but a big burst of energy. And yet, here we – as matter – are. Scientists believe that the answer to understanding why matter won – and we exist – lies in studying a particle called the neutrino and its antimatter opposite, the anti-neutrino. They will be firing beams of both kinds of particles from deep underground in Illinois to the detectors at South Dakota, 800 miles away. This is because as they travel, neutrinos and anti-neutrinos change ever so slightly. The scientists want to find out whether those changes are different for the neutrinos and anti-neutrinos. If they are, it could lead them to the answer of why matter and anti-matter don't cancel each other out. Dune is an international collaboration, involving 1,400 scientists from thirty countries. Among them is Dr Kate Shaw from Sussex University, who told me that the discoveries in store will be \"transformative\" to our understanding of the Universe and humanity's view of itself. \"It is really exciting that we are here now with the technology, with the engineering, with the computer software skills to really be able to attack these big questions,\" she said. Half a world away, Japanese scientists are using shining golden globes to search for the same answers. Gleaming in all its splendour it is like a temple to science, mirroring the cathedral in South Dakota 6,000 miles (9,650 km) away. The scientists are building Hyper-K - which will be a bigger and better version of their existing neutrino detector, Super-K. The Japanese-led team will be ready to turn on their neutrino beam in less than three years, several years earlier than the American project. Just like Dune, Hyper-K is an international collaboration. Dr Mark Scott of Imperial College, London believes his team is in pole position to make one of the biggest ever discoveries about the origin of the Universe. \"We switch on earlier and we have a larger detector, so we should have more sensitivity sooner than Dune,\" he says. Having both experiments running together means that scientists will learn more than they would with just one, but, he says, \"I would like to get there first!\" But Dr Linda Cremonesi, of Queen Mary University of London, who works for the Dune project, says that getting there first may not give the Japanese-led team the full picture of what is really going on. \"There is an element of a race, but Hyper K does not have yet all of the ingredients that they need to understand if neutrinos and anti-neutrinos behave differently.\" The race may be on, but the first results are only expected in a few years' time. The question of just what happened at the beginning of time to bring us into existence remains a mystery – for now. This story was originally published on Tuesday 13 May. The infrastructure of humanity's journey into space may only be decades old, but some of it has already been lost. Now, \"space archaeologists\" are scrambling to save what's left. Astronomers have spotted around a dozen of these weird, rare blasts. Could they be signs of a special kind of black hole? The \"Blue Marble\" was the first photo of the whole Earth and the only ever taken by a human. Fifty years on, new images of the planet reveal visible changes to the Earth's surface. The mission will explore new ways of reducing the cost of feeding an astronaut. Scientists find new but tentative evidence that a faraway world orbiting another star may be home to life.",

    "article_text": "The Chelsea Flower show opened its gates to royalty and celebrities on Monday, with dogs, unusually, taking the spotlight. King Charles III and Queen Camilla were among the first to tour the gardens on display, being joined by famous figures like football icon David Beckham and actress Cate Blanchett. This year's event favours rewilding and sustainability, with mossy paving, native planting and gravel paths. Designers leaned into natural landscapes shaped by climate change and a growing desire to reconnect with nature. But it was not just the planting that got people talking. The RHS and BBC Radio 2 Dog Garden, created by Monty Don, gave four-legged visitors rare top billing. Created with canine comfort in mind, it features dog-friendly lawns, water for wallowing and shade-providing trees. Names of royal and broadcaster-owned dogs are etched into brick paths – including the late Beth, the Queen's Jack Russell, her new puppy Moley and the King's dog Snuff. Don, not usually a fan of show gardens, said the chance to celebrate the dog-owner bond had won him over. The garden will not be judged and will not stay. After Chelsea, it will find a permanent home at Battersea Dogs & Cats Home. Along with Beckham and Blanchett, Dame Joanna Lumley and actor David Tennant were among those getting a preview of the world-famous event, along with BBC presenter Zoe Ball. Two women from Suffolk are exhibiting their heirloom vegetable display at RHS Chelsea Flower Show. A new UK-EU deal means the reversal of a ban on British-grown plants being sold in Northern Ireland. Gareth Thomas says the garden recognises the \"lives lost\" to the HIV epidemic in the 1980s. Student from Doncaster College are this week showcasing their exhibit at the Chelsea Flower Show. A 34-year-old man is arrested over alleged arson attacks on properties connected to Sir Keir Starmer.",

    "title": "Gary Lineker could not keep quiet. In the end, it finished his BBC career",
    "article_text": "This is a sorry end to a long BBC career. Gary Lineker was among the corporation's highest-paid presenters for a reason - he is popular with audiences, knowledgeable and brilliant at his job. But it's an understatement to suggest he has also caused problems for his BBC bosses over the years, as their high-profile football host began to morph into a presenter with opinions that he voiced on social media. In the end, those two things were increasingly in conflict. This has always been about reputation management for the BBC. Lineker had already, in the eyes of BBC bosses, caused the corporation damage with previous social media posts. Mistakenly sharing a video about Zionism which included a rat emoji was the final straw. It was difficult to see how he could continue presenting for the corporation, particularly at a time when the BBC is enmeshed in another controversy surrounding a documentary about Gaza, which it pulled after discovering the child narrator was the son of a Hamas official. I think what's different is that on this occasion, Lineker regrets his actions. He has appeared bullish about previous posts, saying that while he regretted damaging the BBC, he didn't believe, for example, that comparing the language of a Conservative asylum policy to that of 1930s Germany was wrong. Lineker is genuinely upset by what happened. He is mortified that he reposted the video. His relationship with the BBC is coming to an end in circumstances nobody would have wanted, but some might have predicted. He seemed unable or unwilling to accept that his high profile might prevent him from voicing strongly-held views that many believed had an impact on the BBC's need for impartiality. We live increasingly in an age when people want to express their opinions, and often do. Social media has given everyone a platform, and high-profile media figures have huge followings. He could not keep quiet. In the end, it brought him down. But he is a successful podcast entrepreneur, owning a third of the shares in Goalhanger, the company behind hit shows including The Rest is History and The Rest is Politics. I would also not be surprised if he does appear in the future on TV, perhaps even as a presenter of the World Cup for another outlet. He has shown contrition, but it has been a damaging few days. The Match of the Day host will leave the corporation after presenting his final episode on Sunday. A new walking tour of the filming locations of the popular 1980s TV series has launched. Mr Bloom from CBeebies carried out a number of gardening workshops. The BBC asked President Trump whether he was disappointed by the level of the delegation that Russia sent to Turkey. The Match of the Day host says he \"would never knowingly share anything antisemitic\".",

    "title": "Huge challenges await new president of divided Romania",
    "article_text": "Imagine having a president called Nicky. That's what Romanians just voted for: a softly-spoken, slightly geeky mathematician who everyone refers to by his first name, Nicusor – or Nicky. On Monday, hours after claiming victory in the elections, the new president picked up his daughter from school as usual. He's promised his children nothing will change. But for Romania things looked very different this morning. Nicusor Dan has been mayor of Bucharest since 2020 but until now he was little known beyond the capital. That's why his election is widely seen as an act of protest against the old political guard who have governed Romania for over three decades. But it was also the least extreme option for change. Dan's opponent in the second-round vote was George Simion, a hard-right nationalist and Eurosceptic who regularly dishes out public insults. He's also banned from two neighbouring countries because he claims part of Ukraine and all of Moldova belong to Romania. Simion won the first round with 41% of the vote but Dan caught up in the second, and then took over. \"This time, fear managed to defeat fury,\" is how political analyst Radu Magdin explains the shift, and points to a significant increase in turnout. \"Clearly a lot of people are angry in Romania and want to see radical change. But at the same time, we saw massive mobilization of the urban middle class who feared that the country could be taken backwards. \"It was a fear of what may happen if Simion and friends came to power.\" I've met plenty of Simion supporters in recent days. When he turned up to vote on Sunday, a colourful crowd were there at the polling station to greet him. Some were in embroidered national dress and others had brought Romanian flags. They tended to talk about God and the \"traditional values\" they think Simion represents. Two men told me their priority was to prevent the EU \"imposing\" same-sex marriage on Romania. Other voters are drawn to Simion's \"Romania first\" rhetoric and promises of a better life. \"Nothing has been done for us, the working people, and I'm fed up,\" Liliana told me this week from behind a Bucharest market stall piled with apples. She and her husband voted for Simion thinking he wouldn't be \"so corrupt\". So when the results came in she was disappointed. \"I don't think Dan is capable of running a country. But what can we do if people don't want change and progress?\" Liliana shrugged. \"I think children came back to the villages and persuaded their parents against Simion. They scared them into voting for Dan.\" George Simion himself told me he was a patriot and a \"man of my people\". But as the campaign advanced, he made mistakes. Outside the market, feeding pigeons with her children, Diana said she'd been planning to vote for Simion until she saw a video from Paris just before the elections. Attempting to speak French, Simion had described President Macron as having \"dictatorial tendencies\" and said the country was run by \"the ayatollahs\". \"It wasn't okay to do that, to go there and talk so rudely to the French people,\" Diana thinks. \"It made me change my vote.\" Analyst Radu Magdin spots other errors, including aggressive blog posts and the moment when Simion insulted his rival, Dan, calling him \"autistic, poor guy\". \"Other than that, he seemed to flee the public debate and went shaking hands in the pan-European radical right instead,\" Mr Magdin mentions, referring to meetings in Poland, France and Italy right before the vote. \"I would say there were many people who did not really appreciate that.\" For many Romanians, choosing Dan was also a strike against Moscow's meddling. At the election street celebrations last night, as well as yelling the new president's name and cheering, people chanted their defiance: \"Russia, don't forget! Romania is not yours!\" They were referring to evidence Russia interfered in their election back in November to boost the chances of far-right conspiracy theorist, Calin Georgescu. When he came from nowhere to win the first round,the vote was annulled. This weekend was a re-run, with Georgescu banned and Simion in his place. The two were often seen side-by-side, even on voting day. But Georgescu's open sympathy for Russia – he once told me he admired Vladimir Putin – was a turn-off for many voters. Nicusor Dan didn't only win because he was not Simion. His voters liked what he stood for, including a future firmly within Europe. When thousands surrounded his campaign headquarters last night to wait for him to claim victory, many brought EU flags. There was relief as well as excitement. Before the election, young voters had told me they planned radical action if Simion won. \"So many friends say that they will leave Romania because our values do not align with him at all,\" politics graduate Sergiana told me in central Bucharest. \"I feel like in a year or two he would completely mess up our chances to stay in the EU.\" By contrast, Dan put relations with Europe at the heart of his campaign. \"It's better for the European way, for younger people and for Romania – because we get more EU funds, more development,\" another young voter, Petrosanu, approved. \"Also Nicusor is the smartest guy since the revolution. He knows how to do things.\" In the end, Dan's win was emphatic. But millions of Romanian voters chose a different way, different values. While hopes for the 'change' candidate are high, the challenges are huge and patience may be limited. \"In my view, this is the last chance for the mainstream political class to win an election on a 'Save Europe, Save Democracy' platform,\" Radu Magdin warns. George Simion is just 38 and going nowhere; his nationalist AUR party are strong in parliament. \"Next time, it's 'bye bye' if these people do not do their job,\" the analyst says. \"Next time it could be somebody like Simion.\" The deal covers defence, trade, fishing, and a possible youth scheme, in the first big reset since Brexit. A deal between the UK and European Union (EU) has been agreed at a post-Brexit leaders summit in London. A youth visa scheme and how much the UK will contribute financially are among issues still being negotiated It comes after Sir Keir Starmer says his government has struck a post-Brexit agreement with the EU. The two sides have struck a new post-Brexit deal but this so-called 'reset' of the relationship is just the beginning.",

    "title": "Olympic gold swimmer left ‘broken’ by coach's harsh regime and weight comments",
    "article_text": "A world record-breaking swimmer has told BBC Panorama she was left \"broken\" by the harsh regime run by one of the UK's most successful swimming coaches. Rūta Meilutytė, who won gold at the London 2012 Olympics, said Jon Rudd's focus on weighing and swimmers' diets contributed to her struggle with an eating disorder and depression. In total, 12 ex-swimmers have told us they experienced bullying, a toxic training environment and controlling food culture at one of the UK's most prestigious clubs for young elite swimmers when he was head coach. Rudd had faced allegations of bullying and verbal abuse during his 28-year tenure at Plymouth Leander swimming club, but the BBC has learned that no action was taken by the sport's governing body. We have found that Swim England, the governing body, did not act on a confidential 2012 investigation which ruled Rudd should be suspended after hearing evidence about his behaviour from 17 witnesses. Swim England's new chief executive Andy Salmon said he did not know why Rudd had not been suspended, but he was \"deeply, deeply, sorry\" to Plymouth's swimmers and all of those harmed by the governing body's failings. Rudd, who is due to become high performance director of Saudi Arabia's Olympic swimming team, has not responded to the BBC. Plymouth Leander attracted aspiring swimmers from around the world after Rudd established its reputation as a club that produced Olympic athletes. While head coach between 1989 and 2017, he was responsible for swimmers' success, but also had safeguarding responsibilities to ensure their wellbeing. One of Plymouth Leander's most successful swimmers was Antony James,  who won silver at the 2010 Commonwealth Games and represented Team GB at the 2012 Olympics. He wasjailed for 21 years in February for raping two girls he had met at the club. Three people who trained at Plymouth Leander told Panorama that Rudd, who had coached James since he was eight years old, should have known he was interested in younger girls. A former girlfriend of James, also an ex-swimmer, said he was well known for mixing with young teenage girls and that his status as the club's \"golden boy\" meant no one questioned his behaviour. \"Everyone knew - he wasn't trying to hide anything that he was doing, it was very out there and open,\" she said. She was 16 and he was 22 when they started a relationship and she says she believes she was a \"gateway\" to his grooming of younger girls. Rudd was a coach at Plymouth Leander in 2010 when Lithuanian Rūta Meilutyte moved to the UK to be coached by him. She made Olympic history two years later when, aged 15, she became the youngest person to win the 100m breaststroke. Now 28, she recalls Rudd making cutting comments about her weight. When she confided in him that she had been making herself sick after meals to lose weight, she said he laughed and replied: \"Well, at least you get the calories out.\" She said that Rudd did seek help for her once he realised that she was not happy with what he had said. She also described him saying her \"ass was fat\", moments before a major competition, aged 16. Despite being hailed as the club's most successful swimmer, Meilutytė said Rudd's regime \"made me for a while and then it broke me\". She left Plymouth Leander in 2017. Rudd's career, meanwhile, went from strength to strength, with him becoming Swim Ireland's director of performance swimming in the same year. Rudd was employed by Plymouth College, an independent school, until 2017. It ran a partnership with Plymouth Leander between 2001-2024 and many swimmers boarded there. Among the other 11 swimmers to make allegations to Panorama about Rudd was Olympic bronze medallist Cassie Patten. She said the coach had made her train with an injured shoulder and that it eventually ended her career in 2011. Commonwealth Youth gold medallist Phoebe Lenderyou told Panorama Rudd's regime aggravated her eating disorder. Andy Salmon, who has been CEO of Swim England since February 2024, confirmed to the BBC that no action was taken against Rudd despite evidence swimmers had suffered harm and the 2012 report's recommendation that he be suspended for four months. The report would have remained a secret but for the BBC receiving a tip-off in 2023. It said Rudd had been subjected to a lengthy probe, but that none of the complainants had been told the outcome. His case was reviewed after the BBC asked Swim England about it. According to the original investigation, Rudd's assistant coach, Lindsay Trimmings, should also have been suspended from Plymouth Leander. She was later hired by Swim England to be its head of coaching but left in 2023. When Panorama wrote to her, she said she did not want to respond. \"Clearly the organisation failed to act on the independent recommendations made at the time. And I'm really sorry, on behalf of Swim England, for any suffering that that might have led to,\" Mr Salmon told us. The failings of the 2012 investigation into Rudd have led to the governing body announcingit would review 1,500 safeguarding cases carried out across England between 2002 and 2022. Swim England commissioned a listening report into all aquatic sportsafter the BBC first shared multiple swimmers' accounts of mistreatmentin 2023. Published in 2024, the governing body's report found a culture of fear at all levels of the sport that threatened its future. Plymouth Leander said it was \"deeply concerned by the nature and severity\" of Panorama's allegations, stating that the club was \"fundamentally different\" from when Rudd was in charge. It also said it had conducted a \"thorough review\" of its safeguarding policies and procedures to provide \"the safest possible environment\". It said Rudd's employer, Plymouth College, was responsible for his \"oversight and jurisdiction\". Plymouth College, which is now under different ownership, said the club was responsible for safeguarding and that it was \"deeply concerned to hear these testimonies from swimmers who trained at Plymouth Leander\". It said the partnership with Plymouth Leander had been terminated and it now ran its own swimming organisation, Plymouth College Aquatics (PCA). BBC Panorama has also found evidence of a bullying culture at Royal Wolverhampton School Swimming Club, another leading institution in the sport, as recently as last year. Complaints about the behaviour of David Painter, the club's head coach at the time were made by the parents of 11 swimmers, during 2023 and 2024. One of the swimmers, Abby, now 17, told the BBC she was forced to choose between her education and swimming because Painter would not let her have time off to prepare for her GCSEs. She attended a different school several miles away but said she was told she would still have to train on the morning of exams. \"Towards the end I was literally having full blown panic attacks,\" said Abby, who told Panorama she was failing at school. She eventually decided to leave the sport. Alison Hickman, the club's former welfare officer, told the BBC she had given the names of 11 parents who had concerns about Painter to Swim England and said none of them were contacted by the governing body. Swim England told the BBC it had asked the school to resolve the issues. The Royal Wolverhampton School said complaints were confidential. It said the school has \"clear safeguarding procedures\" and \"all formal complaints are investigated swiftly and appropriately\". Painter, who left to coach in Canada last year, said his \"commitment to athlete development and wellbeing has always been at the core\" of his coaching, and that he had never been subject to \"any disciplinary investigations or hearings\". He added that the allegations against him were \"untrue… and defamatory\". Food writer Becky Excell says creating recipes helped her regain a positive relationship with food. The Derby-based charity hopes to increase capacity by a third in two years. Louisa Abbott, from Hampshire, says health and nutrition content was \"very dangerous\" for her. Tia Ainsworth's eating disorder left her too weak to exercise - now she's helping others to weight train. The Royal College of Psychiatrists worries children and young people will be put at risk, as demand rises.",

    "article_text": "A woman has won a long-running battle over a parking fine after sharing her ordeal to TikTok under her alter-ego Zoë Bread. Zoë Bread's campaign started when she received a penalty for parking on Collier Street in Manchester and claimed confusing signs meant she bought a ticket from the wrong machine. Manchester City Council has now backed down and Zoë wants to help other people who have been caught out in the same way. Council leader Bev Craig said the signs \"could be clearer\" and that some other fines issued on the street over the past year would be quashed. After a month-long campaign that included challenging Greater Manchester metro mayor Andy Burnham on a BBC Radio Manchester phone-in, she finally won her battle. \"The only part of it that I think is bad is the amount of effort it took to get heard, which is obviously not possible for a proper person to do,\" she told the BBC. She added that \"their system doesn't work, but my system does,\" putting down her success to being \"persistent and annoying\". Zoë Bread said her problems began because the 'Pay At Machine' sign on the street pointed to both a council-run car park and private one. After unsuccessfully arguing her case, she submitted a Freedom of Information (FOI) request to the council about how many fines had been issued on the street. But the council knocked it back. She then scoured council documents and found there had been a significant rise in the number of penalties issued in the first year the SIP car park was open. Opposition Liberal Democrat councillor Alan Good applauded Zoë's campaign. But he said it \"shouldn't have taken the social media pressure that was largely due to Zoë's following\". He said the council should cancel fines going back further than the last 12 months, considering the big rise in penalties in 2018, when the privately-run car park was first opened. Council leader Craig - who directly contacted the campaign - said she thanked Zoe for drawing attention to the situation. She said the signs on the street complied with all the rules, but that there would be changes. Craig added: \"We're going to address this as soon as possible with new signs, by relocating the meter and by asking the owners of the nearby private car park to take down their signs which have contributed to confusion. \"As a goodwill gesture, we will also quash any pending or unpaid tickets relating to Collier Street - including Zoe's - and review our records of fines for the last 12 months in that location. \"We will refund anyone who said at the time that they believed they had paid for their parking.\" Listen to the best ofBBC Radio Manchester on Soundsand follow BBC Manchester onFacebook,X, andInstagram.

    "article_text": "A 92-year-old care home resident in a wheelchair was sprayed in the face with synthetic pepper spray before being Tasered and hit with a baton by police officers, a jury has been told. PC Stephen Smith emptied almost a full can of pepper spray into Donald Burgess's face when he refused to drop an item of cutlery similar to a butter knife, Southwark Crown Court heard. Mr Burgess, who had one leg, was then Tasered by PC Rachel Comotto, police body-worn camera footage shown to jurors appeared to show. PC Smith, 51, denies two counts of assault by using Pava spray and a baton, and PC Comotto denies one charge of assault by discharging her Taser. Mr Burgess was a resident at a home in St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, when staff called police on 21 June 2022 after they failed to persuade him to hand over the knife, which had a specially adapted handle. Paul Jarvis KC, prosecuting, told jurors the officers made no attempt to talk to staff, and instead approached Mr Burgess, trying to interact with him. He said instead of trying to calm the situation down they inflamed it, using force that was unjustified and unlawful. Jurors were told there was nobody within arm's reach of Mr Burgess at the time, and that it should have been clear he was not mobile. \"It ought to have been obvious by the fact he had one leg that this was a man who wasn't going to be mobile,\" Mr Jarvis said. \"This was an elderly, vulnerable man who may not have understood what was going on. \"Rather than being met with understanding and sympathy, he was confronted by irritation and annoyance on the part of the defendants.\" The following video contains distressing scenes. Mr Jarvis KC, told the court Mr Burgess was suffering from a urinary tract infection on the day of the incident, a condition that can make a person confused, agitated, or even aggressive. He told the jury Mr Burgess was asked to hand over the knife after he had used it to flick food and poke a member of staff in the stomach. Mr Jarvis said managers had spent 30 minutes trying to get him to put the knife down. Mr Burgess, who suffered from multiple health conditions including diabetes and carotid artery disease, had been a resident at the home since 2018. He had not been diagnosed with dementia, but the care home specialised in support for people with the condition. The court was told that one minute and 23 seconds elapsed between the officers arriving and Mr Burgess being Tasered. In the body-worn camera video PC Smith can be heard repeatedly asking Mr Burgess, who was a right leg amputee, to put down the knife. When he doesn't move, PC Smith sprays him with Pava, before using his baton and 12 seconds later, Mr Burgess can be seen crying out in pain when PC Comotto uses her Taser gun. PC Smith then takes the knife from Mr Burgess. Mr Burgess was taken to hospital after the incident and later contracted Covid. He died 22 days later. Mr Jarvis told the jury: \"I want to make it clear – these defendants are not responsible for his death. \"He was an elderly gentleman who was unwell.\" But he added: \"The force used was unnecessary and excessive in the circumstances. \"The defendants assaulted Mr Burgess, causing actual bodily harm.\" The trial was adjourned until Tuesday.

    "title": "US Supreme Court lets Trump end deportation protections for 350,000 Venezuelans",
    "article_text": "The US Supreme Court has said it will allow the Trump administration to terminate deportation protections for some 350,000 Venezuelans in the US. The ruling lifts a hold that was placed by a California judge that kept Temporary Protected Status (TPS) in place for Venezuelans whose status' would have expired last month. Temporary Protected Status allows people to live and work in the US legally if their home countries are deemed unsafe due to things like countries experiencing wars, natural disasters or other \"extraordinary and temporary\" conditions. The ruling marks a win for US President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly tried to use the Supreme Court to enact immigration policy decisions. The Trump administration wanted to end protections and work permits for migrants  with TPS in April 2025, more than a year before they were originally supposed to end in October 2026. Lawyers representing the US government argued the California federal court, the US District Court for the Northern District of California, had undermined \"the Executive Branch's inherent powers as to immigration and foreign affairs,\" when it stopped the administration from ending protections and work permits in April. Ahilan Arulanantham, who represents TPS holders in the case, told the BBC he believes this to be \"the largest single action stripping any group of non-citizens of immigration status in modern US history\". \"That the Supreme Court authorized this action in a two-paragraph order with no reasoning is truly shocking,\" Mr Arulanantham said. \"The humanitarian and economic impact of the Court's decision will be felt immediately, and will reverberate for generations.\" Because it was an emergency appeal, justices on the Supreme Court did not provide a reasoning for the ruling. The court's order only noted one judge's dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. In August, the Trump administration is also expected to revoke TPS protections for tens of thousands of Haitians. The ruling on Monday by the Supreme Court marks the latest in a series of decisions on immigration policies from the high court that the Trump administration has left them to rule on. Last week, the administration asked the Supreme Court to end humanitarian parole for hundreds of thousands of Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan and Venezuela immigrants. Along with some of their successes, the Trump administration was dealt a blow on Friday when the high court blocked Trump from using the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport immigrants in north Texas. Trump had wanted to use the centuries-old law to swiftly deport thousands from the US, but Supreme Court judges questioned if the president's action was legal. The platform will offer a new season and 90 hours of previous episodes to its 300 million subscribers. Much of the state is expected to experience a moderate risk of tornadoes with a current severe thunderstorm warning in effect. Trump sounded optimistic after a two-hour phone conversation with Putin, but a deal still appears far off. The former US president has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, his office says. It was the first government-chartered flight under a programme offering free travel and $1,000 to immigrants in the US illegally.",

The 34-year-old was arrested on Monday morning in Chelsea, south-west London on suspicion of conspiracy to commit arson with intent to endanger life, the force said. His arrest follows that of two other men in connection with the fires. They relate to three incidents: a vehicle fire in Kentish Town, a fire at the prime minister's private home on the same street, and a fire at an address where he previously lived in north-west London. On Saturday, a 26-year-old man was arrested at Luton Airport on suspicion of the same offence. A third man, Roman Lavrynovych, 21, has already been charged with three counts of arson with intent to endanger life. He appeared in court last Friday where he entered no pleas to the charges. The BBC understands that Mr Lavrynovych, a Ukrainian national, is a builder and roofer. He denied arson in a police interview. He has been remanded in custody until the next scheduled hearing at the Old Bailey on 6 June. Meanwhile, police have been given extra time to question the man who was arrested at Luton Airport. He remains in police custody and has not been named. There are three separate incidents being investigated in a probe led by the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command because of the connection with a high-profile public figure. Emergency services responded to a fire in the early hours of 12 May at the Kentish Town home where Sir Keir lived before he became prime minister and moved into 10 Downing Street. Damage was caused to the entrance of the property, which it is understood Sir Keir still owns and rents out, but nobody was hurt. Four days earlier, on 8 May, a car Sir Keir had sold to a neighbour in 2024 caught fire on the same street. The third fire took place on 11 May at the front door of a house converted into flats in Islington. The prime minister had previously lived there. Sir Keir thanked emergency services for their work following the fires, his official spokesman said on 12 May. He added that the PM could not make any further comments relating to a live investigation. The horticultural event welcomes royals, celebrities and dogs, showing rewilding and pet-friendly designs.

    "title": "Iran and Britain summon envoys over alleged spying in UK",
    "article_text": "Britain and Iran have summoned each other's envoys after three Iranians were charged with spying in the UK. Three Iranian men were arrested on 3 May and appeared in court in London on Saturday on charges of spying for the Islamic republic. Iran's IRNA news agency said the British charge d'affaire was asked on Sunday to give an explanation for what it said was \"unjustified\" and \"politically motivated\" arrests. The UK Foreign Office then responded on Monday by summoning Tehran's ambassador to the UK. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the UK would \"not tolerate growing state-backed threats on UK soil\". \"I can confirm the Iranian ambassador has been summoned and [Foreign Secretary David Lammy] is raising with Iranian foreign minister in the strongest terms that the UK will not accept any Iranian state threat activity in the UK,\" she said in Parliament on Monday. She added that the government would draft new powers of proscription to cover state threats. She said they would create a power \"stronger than current National Security Act powers in allowing us to restrict the activity and operations of foreign state-backed organisations in the UK.\" The Foreign Office said the government \"is clear that protecting national security remains our top priority and Iran must be held accountable for its actions\". \"The [ambassador] summons follows this weekend's announcement which stated that three Iranian nationals had been charged with engaging in conduct likely to assist a foreign intelligence service,\" it added. The alleged spying took place from August 2024 to February 2025, according to the Metropolitan Police. Police have identified the suspects as Mostafa Sepahvand, 39, Farhad Javadi Manesh, 44, and Shapoor Qalehali Khani Noori, 55, all living in London. A fourth man had been arrested on 9 May as part of the investigation, but was released without charge, the Met said. The three men who were charged had arrived in the UK between 2016 and 2022 were granted temporary leave to remain after claiming asylum. It is alleged they carried out surveillance with a view to locating journalists associated with Iran International, which produces coverage that is critical of the current regime in Iran. It has been proscribed in Iran as a terrorist organisation. Home Secretary Cooper said the charges against the Iranian nationals came alongside a \"series of grave wider issues\", including \"rising numbers of Iran-linked operations on UK soil\" and a \"nearly 50% in a year\" increase in MI5 state threats investigations. \"The Iranian regime poses an unacceptable threat to our domestic security which cannot continue,\" she said. Five other Iranian men were also arrested on 5 May in London, Swindon, Stockport, Rochdale and Manchester as part of a separate counter-terrorism investigation. Four of the men - who had been held on suspicion of preparation of a terrorist act - had been released from custody, although the investigation \"remains active and is ongoing\", police said. The fifth man was earlier bailed to an unspecified date in May.",

    "title": "Gang must repay £750k for robbery of Olympic cyclist Mark Cavendish",
    "article_text": "Masked intruders who held Olympic cyclist Mark Cavendish at knifepoint as they robbed his house must repay more than £750,000 or face six extra years in prison each. Romario Henry, Ali Sesay and Jo Jobson broke into the athlete's house in Ongar, Essex, while he and his family slept. Two Richard Mille watches, valued at £400,000 and £350,000, are still missing after the raid on 27 November 2021, Chelmsford Crown Court heard. Thejailed robberswere told their sentences would be extended if they did not pay £754,525 within three months. The gang, who covered their faces with balaclavas during the robbery, also stole  three phones, worth £2,325, an empty safe and a £2,200 Louis Vuitton suitcase. They repeatedly punched Sir Mark, who was in bed with his wife, Peta, upon entering his bedroom. Judge Alexander Mills said the trio took \"joint control\" of the stolen property and \"obtained the benefit that flowed\" from the robbery. He said the watches were \"never located at the scene and have not been seen since\", despite Henry claiming they had been sold. They were luxury items that would not depreciate, but instead act as a \"store of wealth\", Judge Mills said. \"I don't accept it was inevitable that they were sold,\" he added. The judge said they were \"clearly in it together\" and that each defendant benefited financially from the break-in. Judge Mills said 28-year-old Jobson, who was convicted of robbery, was paid £4,000 to take part. \"He was promised a further £6,000 on completion, but this was never paid to him,\" the judge added. Analysing the defendants' finances, Judge Mills said Sesay owned a £1,000 Mercedes and £24,740 in cash, while Henry had no assets. Jobson had an unspecified amount of money in a bank account, which was seized alongside Sesay's goods. The judge said the £754,525 sum could be paid off by any of the defendants. He also ordered £1,897 to be paid in compensation to Sir Mark and £3,359 to Mrs Cavendish, as well as an unspecified amount to a company that leased the watches to them. Henry, 34, of Bell Green, Lewisham, south London, was found guilty of two robbery offences aftera trial in 2023, while 30-year-old Sesay, of Holding Street, Rainham, Kent, admitted the same offences. They were jailed for 15 and 12 years respectively. Jobson, 28, of no fixed abode, went on the run after the break-in. He was given a 15-year prison term aftera separate trial.

    "title": "Wait goes on as Salah bids to break Premier League records",
    "article_text": "Mohamed Salah needs one more goal contribution to equal the Premier League record for an individual season The wait to break the Premier League's goal involvement record goes on for Mohamed Salah. But on his 400th Liverpool appearance, he really should have been celebrating equalling the tally. Quite how the Egyptian side-footed Cody Gakpo's low cross wide of an empty net from just yards out in Monday'sdefeat at Brighton,no-one really knows. His own wry smile suggested his own disbelief. Two months ago, he looked set to destroy Premier League records and produce the greatest attacking individual season in the competition's history. Salah's double against Southampton on 8 March took him to 27 goals and 17 assists in 29 matches, just three goal involvements short of the Premier League record of 47, held jointly by Alan Shearer and Andrew Cole. He also looked certain to beat the record of 20 Premier League assists in a season, jointly held by Arsenal's Thierry Henry and Manchester City's Kevin de Bruyne. Since then, has recorded just one goal and one assist in eight matches, leaving him still one short of the goal involvement record and two short of the assist record. After Monday's missed sitter, Liverpool boss Arne Slot said: \"The first thought that goes through my head when I see the ball moving towards Mo, I'm like, 'It's quite a big chance, this could lead to a goal,' because that's what Mo normally does. \"He's been throughout this season almost inhuman. But there were moments in the season where he was human, so it's not the first time that he's not scoring for one or two games in a row. \"But the good thing for us is this hardly ever happens and, if it happens, you can be sure that he will score in the third game of the fourth game.\" After helping Liverpool secure the Premier League title on 27 April, Salah said: \"Hopefully I'm going to break [the goal involvements record] soon. It's something pushing me forward to just keep going and keep working hard.\" With one game to go - the visit of Crystal Palace to Anfield - you still would not bet against him. Salah signs new two-year deal with Liverpool 'Perfect marriage goes on - Liverpool and Salah need each other' Premier League: Brighton beat Liverpool after coming from behind twice - report & reaction Salah, who captained Liverpool for the first time in the loss at Brighton, is certain to equal one record by the end of the season - with the Golden Boot heading his way once more. The 32-year-old leads the goal rankings with 28 this season, five ahead of Newcastle's Alexander Isak with just one match to play. So barring anything ridiculous in the final game of the campaign, Salah will win the Premier League Golden Boot for a fourth time, equalling Henry's record for Arsenal. He will also have an eye on winning the European Golden Shoe, an award given to the leading league scorer in Europe. Sporting's Swedish striker Viktor Gyokeres currently tops those standings with 39 goals but, with the Portuguese league season now over, all he can do is watch and wait. Salah needs two goals in the final game of the campaign against Palace to overtake him, while Real Madrid's Kylian Mbappe is just one goal away from Gyokeres, also with one match remaining. While Salah (28 goals) and Mbappe (29 goals) are way short of the former Coventry striker's tally, they can go past his points total thanks to the Golden Shoe's scoring system. It's not decided simply by which player scores the most goals; the award uses a points-based system that considers the strength of the league in which a player competes. Created in the 1967-68 season, the Golden Shoe was previously awarded to the top scorer in any European league. However, in 1997 the rules were changed to use a ranking format that favours players in the higher profile leagues. Since joining Liverpool from Roma for Â£34m in 2017, Salah has made 354 goal contributions in 400 club appearances - 244 goals and 110 assists. He has already beaten the record for goal involvements in a 38-game season, passing Erling Haaland's best of 44 two years ago (36 goals, eight assists) and Henry's 44 in 2002-03 (24 goals, 20 assists). Since 2006-07, only four players in England, Spain, Italy, Germany or France have reached 50 goal contributions in a single season: Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo (three times each), Barcelona's Luis Suarez (once) and Paris St-Germain's Zlatan Ibrahimovic (once). Messi's best league total came in an incredible 2011-12 season with 66 goal contributions - 50 goals and 16 assists. Salah has both scored and assisted a goal in 49 league matches in his career in Europe's big five leagues. Since Opta has recorded data (from 2006-07), only Messi (102) and Ronaldo (65) have scored and assisted in the same game more often.

    "title": "'Writing on the wall' - what does future hold for Grealish?",
    "article_text": "Jack Grealish played in 82% of City's games in the 2022-23 season but that has fallen to 56% this season Manchester City midfielder Jack Grealish may have to leave this summer with \"the writing on the wall\" for him, says their former goalkeeper Shay Given. Grealish, 29, was a British record signing when he joined Pep Guardiola's side from Aston Villafor Â£100m in 2021. The England international has won three Premier League titles, the Champions League and FA Cup with City but has fallen down the pecking order this season. Grealish has only started 16 times this season in all competitions, and has been on the pitch for 1,520 minutes - fewer than half the amount he played in the 2022-23 season when City won the Champions League. He was an unused substitute asCrystal Palace won the FA Cup finallast weekend, while he also did not get on the pitch when City were beaten at Wembley by rivals Manchester Unitedin 2024. Grealish's future at Etihad Stadium is unclear heading into the summer, with a growing sense that he would benefit from a move before next season. There is likely to be interest from clubs across Europe in a player who may be attracted by the idea of a fresh start at a top club who could provide him with regular football. It remains to be seen whether his reported Â£300,000-per-week wages will prove prohibitive towards any potential move away. \"I have a soft spot for Jack Grealish and the way he is being treated is not on,\" former City keeper Given, who played alongside Grealish at Villa, told BBC Radio 5 Live's Monday Night Club. \"He's not helped himself at times but he is a generational talent that you want to build your team around. \"That's back-to-back FA Cup finals where you need a goal and you don't use him. At the weekend City brought on Claudio Echeverri who made his debut instead. \"Jack is an international, a multiple winner, it was criminal he didn't get on the pitch. The writing is on the wall. I don't know why Pep even brought him to London. He may as well have stayed at home. \"When he plays, he's a mannequin on the wing and just told to keep the shape. Kevin de Bruyne is leaving in the summer and Jack Grealish is the perfect replacement to play in the middle but after what has happened, he maybe won't play for the club again. \"For his career, he has to see what is out there. He is an amazing talent with plenty of years left in him.\" Defeat in the FA Cup final means that City will finish without a major trophy for the first time since Guardiola's first season in charge in 2016-17. They go into their final two Premier League games in sixth place and could miss out on the Champions League next season. Guardiola says discussions will take place between outgoing director of football Txiki Begiristain, his successor Hugo Viana and the player's representatives. \"We didn't talk - I didn't talk with him,\" Guardiola said. \"People don't believe me, but these things belong to the agents and the club and Txiki, and in this case Hugo as well. Both will decide. \"What is going to happen will happen, but he has to come back to start to play minutes again. \"It's not only Jack. There is not one player in my locker room, and I think all the locker rooms around the world, that is happy when they do not play. \"When the team is winning and winning, they have to figure out how everything happens - but they are not happy. \"They are here to play and, when they don't play, they are not satisfied.

    "article_text": "Brendon McCullum also took over as head coach of England's white-ball sides this year England men's Test team are ready to \"shoot for the stars\" in a defining year, says head coach Brendon McCullum. They rose to second in the International Cricket Council Test rankings earlier this month, their highest position since McCullum was appointed in May 2022. After a one-off Test against Zimbabwe, starting on Thursday, they will play marquee series at home against India and the Ashes in Australia. \"We're not trying to pick this team up any more,\" McCullum toldthe BBC Radio 5 Live Cricket show. \"It's a matter of taking this team from a good team into being something English people are really proud of.\" England have won 22 of the 35 Tests they have played under McCullum, having won  one of their previous 17 matches before the New Zealander took over. \"We're actually travelling pretty good but there's an opportunity now,\" he added. \"We're working from a position of strength but now's the time where we shoot for the stars.\" Man Utd, DJing and Fred the tortoise - meet Sam Cook We've said naive things, but we do care - Wood England add NZ great Southee to coaching staff Under McCullum and captain Ben Stokes, England have delivered often thrilling cricket and secured landmark series wins away in Pakistan and New Zealand. However, they failed to regain the Ashes in 2023, having gone 2-0 behind against Australia before surging back to draw the series, while they were also heavily beaten in India and lost in Pakistan last year. After securing the series win in New Zealand in December, they lost the third and final Test in feeble fashion. McCullum said he and his side wants England fans to feel an \"attachment\" to them, liking them both as players and their style of cricket, while also winning series. \"There's no greater opportunity than playing in big series against the best opposition on the biggest stage under the brightest lights to be able to test that,\" he added. Stokes said he hated the word \"ruthless\"when asked about England trying to seal a 3-0 sweep in New Zealand. But McCullum said the all-rounder is \"the most ruthless\" sportsperson he has ever met. \"He is unbelievably driven, to push himself, to push his team-mates, to win at all costs,\" he said. \"We're very lucky to have him in the chair because he's going to be very strong about trying to push this team to the next level.\" Despite the obvious focus on the five-Test series against India and the Ashes down under, McCullum said England will not underestimate Zimbabwe in the four-day Test at Trent Bridge. \"We want to be where our feet are,\" he said. \"This game has an amazing ability to bring you back down to earth if you don't have the respect for the game or the respect for the opposition. \"We go into it as favourites so we need to make sure we're rock hard fit and ready to go and make good decisions under pressure.\" Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "Impressive Raducanu beats Kasatkina in Strasbourg",
    "article_text": "Emma Raducanu is making her first appearance in Strasbourg Emma Raducanu produced an encouraging display to reach the second round in Strasbourg as she continued to build momentum before the French Open. The British number two, who accepted a late wildcard for the tournament, was in fine form in a 6-1 6-3 win over world number 17 Daria Kasatkina. World number 43 Raducanu had not won a set in three previous meetings with Kasatkina but the inconsistent Australian failed to win a single service game. Raducanu will face American Danielle Collins in the last 16 as she continues her preparations for the French Open, which begins on Sunday. \"I'm really proud of my performance - I was very aggressive and I maintained my focus in the second set when it was getting close,\" Raducanu, 22, said afterwards. \"I think I've been building towards this. It's a great feeling. \"As I spend more time on clay I'm beginning to like it more and more. I'm building my relationship with the surface.\" GB's Fearnley reaches second round at Geneva Open Alcaraz and Sinner renew rivalry - Second Serve Paolini ends wait for home winner of Italian Open After reaching the Miami Open quarter-finals in March and moving back inside the world's top 50, Raducanu chose to take a \"physical and mental\" break from competitive action. That meant she did not begin her clay court swing until a month later in Madrid. A second-round exit in the Spanish capital was followed by last week's run to the Italian Open fourth round, where she managed to win three clay-court matches in a row for the first time in her career. Victory over Kasatkina was another indication the Briton is hitting her stride at the ideal time before her second French Open campaign begins. The players exchanged breaks of serve in a scrappy start to the match but, after being gifted a second game by Kasatkina, Raducanu took charge. A hold of serve without reply allowed her to grow in confidence and she was soon dictating play with punishing, powerful groundstrokes. Taking full advantage of her opponent's continued struggles on serve, Raducanu reeled off five consecutive games to win her first set in four meetings with Kasatkina. The second set was not straightforward. Raducanu's opening hold of serve proved invaluable as it was followed by a run of seven consecutive breaks, with former world number eight Kasatkina digging in. Raducanu could not hide her delight after unleashing a superb backhand down the line to close in on victory, eventually ending Kasatkina's resistance with her fourth match point. Raducanu reached the second round in her only previous Roland Garros appearance in 2022. The 2021 US Open champion is currently working with Mark Petchey - a former coach of Andy Murray - on an informal basis, having been without a full-time coach since January. Elsewhere on Monday, fellow Briton Harriet Dart was knocked out in the first round of French Open qualifying, losing 6-1 6-2 to Ukrainian 21-year-old Anastasiya Soboleva. Heather Watson and Francesca Jones will begin their bids to join Raducanu, Katie Boulter and Sonay Kartal in the main draw on Tuesday.

    "title": "McIlroy and the 'non-conforming' driver controversy",
    "article_text": "Rory McIlroy won the Masters at Augusta to complete the career Grand Slam Aside from the brilliance of Scottie Scheffler's imperious third major victory, the next-biggest talking point from the 107th US PGA was the controversy of Rory McIlroy's \"non-conforming\" driver. Rumours emerged early in the championship that the recently crowned Masters winner, who was continually struggling to find Quail Hollow's fairways, had been forced to switch drivers before the year's second major. Initially, there was speculation that the one he had used to such great effect in winning at Augusta had cracked on the eve of the tournament here in North Carolina. But then came a bombshell when PGA Tour Radio reported that the club had failed its test of legality. In response, a statement was issued on Saturday lunchtime during the third round from the PGA of America's chief championships officer Kerry Haigh. It confirmed testing for about a third of the players had been carried out by the United States Golf Association (USGA) \"Finding driver heads that have crept over the line of conformance is not an unusual occurrence, especially for clubs that are hit thousands of times over a long period of time,\" Haigh said. \"The results are kept confidential to protect players, who are unaware the club has fallen out of conformance,\" he added. \"To publicly identify players whose club did not conform can lead to that player being questioned unnecessarily.\" So, there were no names, no actual confirmation of any drivers failing the test and, in this case, little clarity as to what might have happened regarding the world number two. Uncharacteristically, McIlroy ignored reporters after each of his rounds in an event where he only made the cut on the mark and finished three over par in a disappointing share of 47th place. Observers were left with a vacuum, which was filled in some quarters with ill-informed and damaging speculation that might have called into question the validity of McIlroy's Masters win. \"The fact that it got leaked leads people that don't have all the information to draw conclusions that are not correct,\" commented DP World Tour player Oliver Wilson, who watched all four days in North Carolina while commentating for BBC Radio 5 Live. This video can not be played Watch: Rory McIlroy's driver issues explained by Golf Digest journalist and equipment expert Luke Kerr-Dineen Players, selected at random, subject their driver for testing before most big tournaments. As Haigh explained, repeated use of the club wears down its face which becomes more springy as a result. This trampoline effect, which can add distance to drives, is known as the coefficient of restitution (COR), and there are strict rules on this to ensure drivers do not become, in effect, supercharged. \"It's just an accepted thing that sometimes you might have to change driver, and within the golfing world nobody really bats an eye at it,\" former Ryder Cup player Wilson added. But, because testing results are treated with such secrecy, McIlroy's situation gained traction as he toiled his way through his first major since winning the Masters. Then came rumours that Scheffler had also fallen foul of wearing down the face of his driver and had been forced to switch clubs before his triumphant week. The champion happily confirmed this during his winner's media conference. \"My driver did fail me this week,\" said the 28-year-old after adding the PGA to his two Masters titles. \"We had a feeling that it was going to be coming because I've used that driver for over a year. \"I was kind of fortunate for it to last that long.\" While saying it \"was no big deal\", the American did call for the regulations to be tightened. \"I would argue that if we're going to test the drivers, we need to be even more robust in the way we test them,\" he said. \"That was a conversation I had with one of the rules officials - if it's something we're going to take seriously I feel like we're almost going halfway with it right now.\" Scheffler added: \"It's a newer rule that we haven't quite gotten right yet. I think we have some stuff to figure out, get more robust and get even more strict. \"You can test guys every week if you want. I mean, there's no reason why we shouldn't.\" 'Scheffler's Woods-like mentality should worry chasing pack' Dominant Scheffler resists Rahm challenge to win US PGA The world number one is correct. Every player runs the risk of playing a club that is not legal yet only a third of the field are currently tested. No-one is intentionally cheating, character should not be called into question. As Haigh's statement pointed out: \"Neither the USGA nor the PGA of America have any concerns about player intent.\" But, as we found out last week, if an adverse result is leaked - as was the case with McIlroy - controversy can ensue. It is thought about eight drivers were found to have breached the rules last week, yet only the 36-year-old's - and latterly Scheffler's - became public knowledge. This is the likely explanation for the Northern Irishman's reticence to speak with reporters in his first major since completing the career Grand Slam. That was his prerogative - no player is mandated to speak to the media but the end result here was that fans were not able to hear from one of the game's superstars, which is an unsatisfactory outcome. It is hard to fathom the need for such confidentiality. \"I'm sure they have reasons,\" Wilson told BBC Sport. \"But I don't think they're strong enough. \"This has happened because they've tried to keep it so confidential. I feel like they may well, after this, look at how it's dealt with because it's just not fair to a player that has had it leaked and had to deal with this kind of nonsense.\" Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "article_text": "Arthur Ashe Stadium was built in 1997 and the roof was added in 2016 Arthur Ashe Stadium - the US Open's showcase court - is set to be expanded as part of an $800m renovation project at Flushing Meadows, the United States Tennis Association has announced. The USTA has described the proposed work at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Centre as the \"largest single investment in US Open history\". It includes a plan to increase by about 2,000 the capacity of Arthur Ashe Stadium - which currently holds 23,771, and is the largest tennis arena in the world. The stadium is set to get a new main entrance, with facilities inside for fans to be modernised. Further plans include a new player performance centre at Flushing Meadows, with expanded indoor and outdoor warm-up areas for players. The USTA intends to fund the renovation project itself - with work to be done in phases between tournaments to minimise disruption - and hopes to get it completed by 2027. Lew Sherr, CEO and executive director of the USTA, said: \"This project enables us to maintain the greatest stage in tennis - Arthur Ashe Stadium - which was constructed more than 25 years ago, and modernize it in a way that will set it up for the next 25 years.\" Live scores, results and order of play Get tennis news sent straight to your phone",

    "title": "Dry spring weather to make way for rain in parts of Europe",
    "article_text": "The extremely dry spring weather in north-westernEuropehas continued this month, with swathes of the UK, northern France, the Low Countries and Germany receiving just 10% of their normal May rainfall. The summery conditions, caused by semi-permanent high pressure across the region, are expected to change significantly this week, ending the dry spell for many and delivering much-needed rainfall. The northern hemisphere’s polar jet stream – a narrow corridor of fast-moving wind that blows approximately 6 miles above Earth’s surface – will intensify in the coming days as it leaves the US and heads into the Atlantic. During the weekend and early next week, winds of more than 124mph (200km/hr) are forecast, driving in areas of low pressure from the Atlantic. As they reach north-western Europe, the winds will break down areas of high pressure and plunge much of the region into more unsettled weather, with frontal rainfall likely into next week – a welcome event at a time of year that is crucial for the development of crops. In the run-up to these Atlantic lows, warm and unstable air could trigger showers and thunderstorms in southern France and the Alps, followed by drop in temperature that could bring snow to high altitudes on Friday. It will also become very unsettled across parts of southern and eastern Africa over the next few days, notablySouth Africa, southern Mozambique and Madagascar. Deep areas of low pressure passing eastwards off the southern tip of the continent will generate cold southerly winds and a chance of snowfall over the mountains in SouthAfrica. Daytime temperatures are likely to be 10-12C below the seasonal norm, such as in Bloemfontein, where it will struggle to top 10C on Wednesday, far below the 21C average in late May. Gale-force winds exceeding 50mph are expected to trigger dangerous sea conditions along the south-eastern coast of South Africa, whipping waves above 7 metres. Strong winds and high waves will also bombard the southern Mozambique channel between Madagascar and the African mainland, posing a threat to mariners.",

    "title": "At least 50 migrants sent to El Salvador prison entered US legally, report finds",
    "article_text": "At least 50 Venezuelan men sent by theTrump administrationto a prison in El Salvador had entered the United States legally, according to a review by the Cato Institute. Thereport, published by the libertarian thinktank on Monday, analyzed the available immigration data for only a portion of the men who were deported to El Salvador’snotorious Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot), and focuses on the cases where records could be found. “The government calls them all ‘illegal aliens.’ But of the 90 cases where the method of crossing is known, 50 men report that they came legally to the United States, with advanced US government permission, at an official border crossing point,” Cato said in its report. This number aligns with broader trends among Venezuelan migrants, many of whom entered the country either as refugees or through a Biden-era parole program that granted two-year work permits to those with US-based sponsors. “The proportion isn’t what matters the most: the astounding absolute numbers are,” reads the report. “Dozens of legal immigrants were stripped of their status and imprisoned inEl Salvador.” Cato’s analysis goes against the Trump administration’s justification for sending the men to El Salvador, saying that only undocumented people were deported. The report says that 21 men were admitted after presenting themselves at a port of entry, 24 were granted parole, four were resettled as refugees, and one entered the US on a tourist visa. The Trump administration deportedmore than 200alleged gang members to the Cecot mega-prison in March, controversially invoking the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 law meant only to be used in wartime, as justification. The Cecot prison is known for its harsh conditions, and lawyers for Venezuelan deporteeshave allegedthat the migrants being held there are victims of physical and emotional “torture”. Sign up toHeadlines US Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion The deportations have since drawn widespread scrutiny. To date, the Trump administration has not released complete records for the more than 200 Venezuelans transferred to El Salvador. Cato’s review includes information for 174 men whose cases have some degree of public documentation. The Trump administration has accused many of the deported Venezuelan men of gang involvement, but in many cases, those claims appear to hinge largely on their tattoos. Many of the tattoos cited as evidence have no connection to gang activity. The markings reflect, in many cases, personal or cultural references. Cato uses the example of Andry José Hernández Romero,a makeup artist, who has crown tattoos on his arms that reference the Three Kings Day celebrations in his Venezuelan hometown. The report comes amid a sprawling crackdown on immigrants in the US. On Monday,the supreme court ruledthat the Trump administration could proceed with efforts to revoke temporary protected status (TPS) for Venezuelans. Ending TPS, which protects foreign citizens who cannot return home because of war, natural disaster or other extraordinary circumstances, could open up approximately 350,000 people for potential deportation.

    "title": "Murder of Colombian model sparks outrage over rising femicides",
    "article_text": "The murder of aColombianmodel and influencer, now being investigated as a possible femicide, has triggered widespread outrage and renewed criticism of the country’s failure to protect women. María José Estupiñán, a 22-year-old student, model and influencer from the north-eastern city of Cúcuta, was killed on 15 May. According to the police, the suspect arrived at her house disguised as a delivery man and shot Estupiñán in the face when she opened the door. Surveillance camera footage showed the suspect fleeing shortly afterwards. “She was a young, enterprising woman with a whole life ahead of her, but those dreams are cut short like the dreams of many women in this country,” said Magda Victoria Acosta, the president of the national gender commission of the Colombian Judiciary. Authorities later confirmed that Estupiñán had previously been a victim of domestic violence, and that preliminary investigations point to a possible femicide, the intentional killing of women and girls because of their gender. “It could be a case of femicide, since she filed several complaints for domestic violence in previous years, but that is a matter of investigation,” said Col Leonardo Capacho of the Cúcuta police. Estupiñán had previously reported her ex-partner for domestic violence, according to women’s rights lawyers. The day before her death, a judge reportedlyruled in Estupiñán’s favour,ordering the abuser to compensate Estupiñán with 30m pesos, approximately $1,554. Activists say the Colombian state is implicated in the crime. Alejandra Vera, the director of Cúcuta-based feminist collective Woman, Speak Out and Move It, said the murder was “preventable” but that the “state fails to act”. “The brutal murder of María José is the result of a system that normalises violence against women,” said Vera. “Colombia is facing a pandemic of femicides – every 28 hours, a woman is a victim. Each crime reflects a systematic pattern of impunity and state negligence. “María José, like thousands, did what the system demands: she reported the crime, presented evidence, and asked for help. But the state let her die,” said Vera. “There are no effective protection orders, no follow-up care for abusers, and no shelters with the capacity.Womenare left completely unprotected, and the perpetrators know it.” Femicide does not refer to any homicide of a woman, but rather to the murder of women for their gender. According to the Colombian Observatory of Femicides, femicides in the South American nation reached a seven-year high in 2024, with886 recorded. The NGO said that up untilMarch 2025, 207 femicides had been reported. Figures vary, however, with theattorney generalacknowledging 640 cases by November 2024. Human Rights Watchhas previously warned that gender-based violence in Colombia “is widespread” and that perpetrators are “rarely held accountable”. Vera said that laws exist to protect women in Colombia, “but they are dead letters”. According to Woman, Speak Out and Move It, the police lack staff and resources, prosecutors are not trained to investigate gender-based violence, and repeat offenders are not monitored. Meanwhile, the National Women’s Network NGO said that 73% of femicides in Colombia between 2021 and 2023 went unsolved. Estupiñán’s killing as been compared to the 13 May shooting of 23-year-old influencer Valeria Márquez in Mexico,who was killed when livestreaming at a salon. The Mexican state prosecutor’s office has said it was investigating the crime as femicide. Women’s rights activists are now calling for marches in Cúcuta and Bogotá to demand justice for Estupiñán. At her funeral this weekend, a family member said: “María José, life for you was a wonderful journey, but very short. Fly, fly very high,majo.”",

    "title": "France sparks outcry with plan for prison wing near former penal colony",
    "article_text": "French plans to build a maximum-security prison wing for drug traffickers and Islamic militants near a former penal colony in French Guiana have sparked an outcry among local people and officials. The wing would form part of a $450m (£337m) prison announced in 2017 that is expected to be completed by 2028 and hold 500 inmates. The prison would be built in Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, a town bordering Suriname that once received prisoners shipped by Napoleon III in the 1800s, some of whom were sent to the notoriousDevil’s Islandoff the coast of French Guiana. The French justice minister, Gérald Darmanin, announced plans to build the high-security wing during an official visit to French Guiana on Saturday. He said in a Facebook post that 15 of the wing’s 60 spaces would be reserved for Islamic militants. Darmanin was quoted by Le Journal du Dimanche, a French weekly newspaper, as saying that the prison also aims to keep suspected drug traffickers from having any contact with their criminal networks. “We are seeing more and more drug trafficking networks,” he told reporters in French Guiana. “We must react.” French media, quoting the justice ministry, reported that people from French Guiana and French Caribbean territories would be sent in priority to the new prison. The announcement angered many across French Guiana, an overseas French department located in South America. It was once an infamous colony known for holding French political prisoners, including army Capt Alfred Dreyfus, who was accused of being a spy. Dreyfus was incarcerated on Devil’s Island, a penal colony that operated for a century and was featured in the bestselling French novel Papillon, which later was made into two movies. Jean-Paul Fereira, the acting president of French Guiana’s territorial collective, an assembly of 51 lawmakers that oversees local government affairs, said it was taken aback by the announcement since the plan to build a high-security wing was never discussed ahead of time. “It is therefore with astonishment and indignation that the elected members of the Collectivity discovered, with the entire population of Guiana, the information detailed in Le Journal Du Dimanche,” he wrote in a statement posted on social media. Fereira said the move was disrespectful and insulting, noting that the agreement French Guiana signed in 2017 was for the construction of a new prison meant to alleviate overpopulation at the main prison. “While all local elected officials have long been calling for strong measures to curb the rise of organised crime in our territory, Guiana is not meant to welcome criminals and radicalised people from (mainland France),” he wrote. Also decrying the plan was Jean-Victor Castor, a member of parliament in French Guiana. He said he wrote directly to France’s prime minister to express his concerns, noting that the decision was taken without consulting local officials. “It’s an insult to our history, a political provocation and a colonial regression,” Castor wrote in a statement issued on Sunday as he called on France to withdraw the project. A spokesperson for France’s justice minister did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.",

    "title": "US supreme court allows Trump to revoke protected status for Venezuelans",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump’s administration can end legal protections that have shielded about 350,000 Venezuelans from potential deportation, the supreme court ruled on Monday. America’s highest court granted a request byKristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, to revoke temporary protected status (TPS) for the Venezuelans while an appeal proceeds in a lower court. The government grants TPS to foreign citizens who cannot safely return home because of war, natural disasters or other “extraordinary” conditions, giving them deportation protection and access to work permits. Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, hadgrantedthe status to Venezuelans due to political and economic strife in their home country. Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, haspersecutedlawyers and journalists while millions of citizens suffering hardship have sought refuge elsewhere. Biden extended TPS for another 18 months just days before Trump, who pledged to deport record numbers of undocumented immigrants, returned to the White House in January. In March a federal judge in California put a temporary stay onTrump administrationplans to end TPS for the Venezuelan nationals. The San Francisco-based district judge Edward Chen said the plan to end TPS “smacks of racism” and mischaracterises Venezuelans as criminals. “Acting on the basis of a negative group stereotype and generalizing such stereotype to the entire group is the classic example of racism,” Chen wrote, adding that Venezuelan TPS holders were more likely to hold bachelor’s degrees than US citizens and less likely to commit crimes than the general US population. The San Francisco-based ninth US circuit court of appeals on 18 April declined the administration’s request to pause the judge’s order. The Trump administration thenasked the supreme court to intervene. Justice department lawyers said in their filing that Chen had “wrested control of the nation’s immigration policy” away from the government’s executive branch, headed by Trump. “The court’s order contravenes fundamental executive branch prerogatives and indefinitely delays sensitive policy decisions in an area of immigration policy that Congress recognized must be flexible, fast-paced, and discretionary,” they wrote. The plaintiffs, including some of the TPS recipients and theNational TPS Allianceadvocacy group, said Venezuela remains an unsafe country. They told the supreme court that granting the administration’s request “would strip work authorization from nearly 350,000 people living in the US, expose them to deportation to an unsafe country and cost billions in economic losses nationwide”. But the supreme court granted the justice department’s request. Its brief order was unsigned, as is typical when the justices act on an emergency application. The liberal justiceKetanji Brown Jacksonwas the sole member of the court to publicly dissent. Democrats in the House of Representatives condemned the decision. Pramila Jayapal, ranking member of the immigration integrity, security and enforcement subcommittee, said in a statement: “It is shameful that the Trump administration would pull the rug out from so many Venezuelans who came into the country lawfully, fleeing untold violence and devastation in their home country.” Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultzposted on social media: “Venezuelan TPS holders fled the Maduro regime and built lives in America. This atrocious decision allows Trump to deport non-criminals back to a murderous dictator. This fight is NOT over. We must pass my Venezuela TPS Act to keep our community safe.” The state department currentlywarns against travelto Venezuela “due to the high risk of wrongful detentions, terrorism, kidnapping, the arbitrary enforcement of local laws, crime, civil unrest, poor health infrastructure”. The department withdrew all diplomatic personnel in 2019. Trump campaigned for president promising to deport millions of undocumented migrants and a number of his executive orders around immigration have encountered pushback from judges across the country – including the supreme court. Trump lashed out at the court last week after itblocked his effortto resume deportations of alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua using an obscure wartime law, the 1798 Alien Enemies Act. In a 7-2 decision the court, which includes three justices nominated by Trump, said the alleged Tren de Aragua members were not being given enough time to legally contest their removal. Trump responded: “The Supreme Court of the United States is not allowing me to do what I was elected to do. This is a bad and dangerous day for America!” The Trump administration in April also terminated TPS for thousands of Afghans and Cameroonians in the US. Those actions are not part of the current case. Pre-emptive arrests of many people still under the shelter of TPS have been carried out despite the lawsayingsuch people “shall not be detained” based on their immigration status.",

    "title": "Runaway rice prices spell danger for Japan’s prime minister as elections loom",
    "article_text": "Japan’s government is battling record-low approval ratings as consumers voice anger at soaring rice prices just weeks before key national elections. Attempts to bring down the price of theJapanese staplehave had little effect, prompting calls for a reduction in the consumption (sales) tax to ease thecost-of-living crisis. A new poll by the Kyodo news agency found that consumers blamed the administration of the prime minister,Shigeru Ishiba, for rising pressure on household finances. Approval ratings for Ishiba’s cabinet stand at 27.4%, according to the poll, the lowest since he took office last October and a dip of more than five percentage points in the past month, Kyodo said. Ishiba’s ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP) has so far ruled out a cut in the 10% consumption tax, which promises to be a focal point of upper house elections in July. Ishiba is already under pressure after the LDP and its junior coalition partnerlost their lower house majoritylast autumn. Significant losses in the upper house will only add to calls from opponents inside the party for him to go. Almost three-quarters of respondents said the tax, which is levied on a wide range of goods and services, should be cut “only for food items”, “for all products” or be abolished altogether, the poll found. More worrying for Ishiba, just over 87% of respondents said government efforts to rein in the price ofricehad been “insufficient”, while more than 74% said they did not expect ongoing US-Japan tariff talks – including negotiations on American imports of rice and other foodstuffs – to end favourably to Japan. Earlier this year Ishiba’s government took the unusual step ofdipping into its vast rice reserves. In March it began releasing stockpiled rice in an attempt to arrest price rises that have been blamed on a combination of factors, including higher demand fuelled in part by the tourism boom, distribution bottlenecks, and suspected hoarding by wholesalers and distributors in anticipation of further shortages. But the move, which is usually reserved for shortages caused by natural disasters and crop failures, did not have the desired effect, with prices of domestic rice falling only marginally. The price of rice sold in supermarkets averaged ¥4,214 ($29) for 5kg during the week to 4 May, according to the agriculture ministry. That is ¥18 cheaper than the all-time high recorded a week earlier, but still around double the price at the same time last year. In response, the government said last week it would double the supply of stockpiled rice, with an additional 300,000 tons due for release in the three months to July, media reports said. That is on top of 300,000 tons that has already been released from emergency stockpiles since March. In addition, some of the rice will bypass wholesalers so it can reach shops more quickly. The mounting rice crisis has forced more Japanese restaurants and consumers to turn to cheaper imports. In April, Japanimported South Korean ricefor the first time in a quarter of a century. Last week, the supermarket chain Aeon said it would start selling US-produced Calrose rice from early next month. A 4kg bag will cost about 10% less than Japanese rice.",

    "title": "Trump tariffs could lead to surge of cheap Chinese vapes in UK, experts say",
    "article_text": "China is set to flood Britain with cheap vapes, researchers have said, as manufacturers seek to capitalise on the world’s second biggest market after Donald Trump’s tariffs. A trade standoff between Washington and Beijing has thrown the business world into chaos, with investors watching as each country dares the other to blink first. After last week’s uneasy truce, the total US import tax on Chinese-made vapes stood at about 60%. That has sent China’s $11.1bn (£8.4bn) e-cigarette export industry, already scarred by stringent domestic restrictions in 2022, back to the drawing board. It comes as the UK’s forthcoming ban on disposable vapes, which aims to reduce the number of devices that are thrown away – about 8m a week – and stop young people from taking up the habit, has brought new models of e-cigarette into the market. Deborah Arnott, an honorary associate professor at University College London and the former chief executive of Action onSmokingand Health, said China’s natural response would be to target the UK. “With reduced access to the US, there will be growing competition to sell to the UK market, as it’s the main alternative,” she said. Factory owners have already felt the pinch over the past few weeks of global uncertainty, according to Dr Steve Shaowei Xu, a research scientist at the University of Waterloo, Ontario, and an expert on the Chinese e-cigarette industry. “Already there are reports [that] shipments have been blocked and US orders cut in half,” Xu said, adding that the “very sophisticated” industry would find ways to circumnavigate the current “disaster”. Britain, where more than 90% of e-cigarettes are imports from China, has its own internal problems with vaping. Ministers are preparing for a domestic ban on disposable vapes from 1 June, with the aim of curbing youth vaping and reducing plastic waste. Experts are concerned that the industry has already come up with a workaround that will stymie the efforts of the UK government, while cheaper Chinese imports diverted from the US could put downward pressure on prices. Manufacturers have been rapidly developing new models that comply with the ban, with variations of popular brands now widely available. These vapes are rechargeable, and have a replaceable pod and a changeable coil, which means they qualify as a “vape kit” and not a disposable. But experts say these often look “very similar” to disposable versions, raising fears they will be treated as such. There are also concerns over the availability of refillable pods. The Guardian went to 30 stores in London and Manchester, looking for refills of the Elf Bar 600 prefilled-pod kit. Only two shops stocked them. Arnott said: “All the main manufacturers produce these products now and they look the same and are very similar prices to the disposables they are replacing. “My concern is that because they don’t look any different and are still very cheap, people may carry on treating them like disposables and throwing them away rather than buying refills.” Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Xu said the Chinese vaping industry was a “very sophisticated, fast-moving consumer goods industry” and would continue to find workarounds to comply, particularly in the face of “disaster” tariffs. He added: “In the longer term they can try to move manufacturing overseas to circumvent the tariffs, but in the short term they have to find replacement markets to survive.” Scott Butler, the executive director of Material Focus, a not-for-profit organisation that runs the Recycle Your Electricals campaign, said the ban did not break the “throwaway vaping” habit. He said: “This ban takes the most environmentally wasteful and damaging types of vapes off the market, so that is a good thing. “But millions and millions of vapes are going to continue to be sold, and unless there’s real action to make it easier for the public to recycle them, they’ll keep ending up in bins, on streets and in landfill.” An Elf Bar and Lost Mary spokesperson said: “We can confirm our refill pods and containers are widely available across the UK, including all key wholesalers and major supermarkets – and that this scale continues to grow. “However, we understand your concerns around refill accessibility, as we are not in a position to know the extent to which all other brands are making refill parts available. “Although we have not had the opportunity to review the research in question, we are disappointed the availability of our refills does not appear to be fully reflected. To give an accurate and balanced picture of the current market landscape, it is important that all major brands are included.”",

    "title": "Trump and Putin hold phone call but Kremlin refuses Ukraine ceasefire",
    "article_text": "Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump have held a rare phone call, which the US leader described as “excellent”, but the Kremlin refused to agree to a ceasefire in the war with Ukraine, despite pressure from Washington and European allies. Speaking to reporters in Sochi after the two-hour conversation on Monday, Putin described the call as “very meaningful and frank” and said he was prepared to work withUkraineon drafting a memorandum for future peace talks. However, the Russian leader declined to support the US-proposed 30-day unconditional ceasefire, which Ukraine had already agreed to – and which Washington had framed as the call’s primary objective. Putin also suggested his country’s maximalist objectives in the war with Ukraine were unchanged. In contrast, Trump offered a far more positive spin, saying in a post on his Truth Social network that the talks went “very well”. “The tone and spirit of the conversation were excellent … Russia and Ukraine will immediately start negotiations toward a Ceasefire and, more importantly, an END to the War,” he wrote, suggesting that the Vatican should host future Russia-Ukraine negotiations. Trump’s statement after the call with Putin also suggested the US would be stepping back from the negotiations. He said the conditions for a deal could only be negotiated by the “warring parties”, despite his earlier claim that he could end the war in a single day. Trump later said it would be “great” to hold peace talks at the Vatican, but again suggested the US could abandon its involvement, telling reporters that if there is no progress: “I’m just going to back away.” Beyond Trump’s occasionally optimistic rhetoric, no breakthrough appears in sight. Despite previouslydemanding an immediate ceasefireand backing Europe’s ultimatum for Russia to halt hostilities, he now appears to be once again easing off pressure on Moscow. He made no mention of his previous threats to impose sanctions on Russia if it did not agree to halt the fighting. Moscow has consistently rejected extended ceasefire proposals, arguing they would give Ukraine time to rearm and regroup at a time Russian forces are making battlefield advances. On Monday, Putin claimed Russia supported a halt to hostilities, but said it was necessary to “identify the most effective paths toward peace”. Crucially, Putin repeated his longstanding refrain that the “root causes” of the war must be addressed: a reference to Russia’s far-reaching demands that would severely undermine Ukraine’s sovereignty. These demands include forcing Ukraine to “denazify” and demilitarise, cutting back its armed forces, barring it from receiving western military support, and imposing sweeping limits on its sovereignty. Since Trump’s re-election, Putin has been engaged in a delicate balancing act with the US president, appearing to support peace talks to stay in Trump’s favour, while pushing for terms that in effect amount to Ukraine’s capitulation. In an apparent show of confidence and nonchalance, Putin took the call with Trump on Monday while touring a music school in Sochi. His bravado is fuelled by Russia’s slow but steady battlefield gains, Europe’s disjointed response, and a domestic economy increasingly adapted for a prolonged war. Trump said he spoke with Zelenskyy and several European leaders after his call with Putin. In a statement late on Monday, Zelenskyy insisted Ukraine was ready for a full ceasefire and direct negotiations with Moscow, but said: “If the Russians are not ready to stop the killings, there must be stronger sanctions. Pressure on Russia will push it toward real peace.” He added: “If Putin puts forward unrealistic demands, this will mean that Russia continues to drag out the war, and deserves that Europe, America, and the world act accordingly, including with further sanctions. Russia must end the war it started, and it can begin doing so any day.” Zelenskyy also rejected Russia’s demands for Ukraine to withdraw its troops from the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, which Russia claims to have annexed but does not fully control. “No one will withdraw our troops from our territories,” he told reporters. The Ukrainian leader also urged the US not to “distance itself from the talks and the pursuit of peace”. “The only one who benefits from that is Putin,” he said. The flurry of diplomatic activity on Monday came days afterthe first meeting between Russian and Ukrainian delegations in three years, held in Istanbul. Those talks broke down after Russia demanded more territory as a condition for halting the fighting. Sign up toThis is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion A day after the delegations met, Trump said he would speak by phone with Putin to end the “bloodbath” in Ukraine. The US leader proclaimed “nothing will happen” on the peace talks until he met Putin. But Putin and Trump remained silent on the prospect of a meeting on Monday. Despite Putin’s continued refusal to agree to a temporary ceasefire, Trump has stopped short of directly criticising him – even asa growing consensus in Washingtonsees the Russian president as the main obstacle to progress in the peace talks. As in previous calls, Putin appeared to cultivate a personal rapport with Trump, congratulating him on the birth of his 11th grandson, according to Putin’s top foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov. Putin has publicly praised Trump on several occasions, flattering him as “courageous” after the 2024 assassination attempt at a campaign rally. He also claimed to have prayed for “his friend” after Trump was grazed by a bullet. According to Ushakov, Trump told Putin during the call: “Vladimir, you can pick up the phone anytime. I’ll be happy to answer and happy to talk with you.” Speaking before the call between the two leaders, the US vice-president, JD Vance, said Trump would press Putin on whether he was “serious” about ending the war. “We realise there’s a bit of an impasse here. And I think the president’s going to say to President Putin: ‘Look, are you serious? Are you real about this?’” Vance said as he prepared to depart from Italy. “I think honestly that President Putin, he doesn’t quite know how to get out of the war,” Vance said, adding that he had just spoken to Trump. He said Trump may offer Putin economic incentives to accept some concessions on Ukraine in return for peace. But the vice-president also raised the prospect of the US walking away from the talks – a scenario that will unsettle European allies and raise doubts about America’s willingness to keep providing military and economic aid to Ukraine. Vance said that it “takes two to tango. I know the president’s willing to do that, but if Russia is not willing to do that, then we’re eventually just going to say, this is not our war. Fearing that Trump might strike a deal with the Kremlin at Ukraine’s expense, European leaders rushed on Sunday to sway his thinking before the talks. The British prime minister, Keir Starmer, said he held talks with the leaders of the US, Italy, France and Germany on Sunday evening to coordinate efforts to pressure Russia into accepting an unconditional ceasefire, warning that new sanctions could be imposed if Moscow refuses to engage seriously. The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said in a statement: “Putin must show he wants peace by accepting the 30-day unconditional ceasefire.”",

    "article_text": "Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed that Israel will “take control” of all of Gaza, as three key allies attacked his “egregious” escalation of the military campaign and blockade on humanitarian aid. Britain, France andCanadaattacked Israel’s expansion of its war as disproportionate, described conditions in Gaza as “intolerable” and threatened a “concrete” response if Israel’s campaign continues. Earlier that day, Israel’s military declared an entire city a combat zone, airstrikes killed more than 60 people, and the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said Israel’s army would “wipe out” what remains of Palestinian Gaza. “We will not stand by while the Netanyahu government pursues these egregious actions. If Israel does not cease the renewed military offensive and lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid, we will take further concrete actions in response,” the three allied governments said in a statement on Monday. Netanyahu responded to the message, saying Israel will continue to defend itself until total victory was achieved. “The leaders in London, Ottawa and Paris are offering a huge prize for the genocidal attack on Israel on October 7 while inviting more such atrocities,” Netanyahu said. International pressure over a looming famine forced the Israeli prime minister to announce on Sunday night that he would ease the 11-week siege ofGazato prevent a “starvation crisis”. Nearly 24 hours later the UN said nine trucks of aid had been cleared to enter. This is less than 2% of daily shipments before the war, when Palestinians in Gaza were well fed and the strip had its own agricultural sector, and will make no meaningful difference to the crisis now gripping most of its 2.3 million population. Britain,Franceand Canada described Israeli measures as “wholly inadequate”, warned it risked breaching international law and called for “a return to delivery of aid in line with humanitarian principles”. Netanyahu’s decision to allow even a trickle of food in to Gaza had been attacked by far-right critics including members of his own cabinet. On Monday he shared a video on social media explaining his hand had been forced by close allies. For weeks, Israeli officials insisted that there were “no shortages” in Gaza. But “senators” who are Israel’s “greatest friends in the world” had warned they would drop support for the country over images of starving Palestinians, Netanyahu said. “[They told me]: ‘We cannot accept images of hunger, mass hunger. We cannot stand that. We will not be able to support you,’” Netanyahu said. He added that deepening desperation inside Gaza was taking Israel towards a “red line, to a point where we might lose control”,without clarifying what he was referring to. He did not name his critical “friends”, but last week at the end of trip around the region – which did not include a stop in Israel – Donald Trump said“a lot of people are starving” in the strip, and claimed he would “take care” of the situation. After he secured the release of a dual US-Israeli national hostage from Hamas last week, there had been hopes the US president would broker a lasting ceasefire for the entire strip. Instead, Israellaunched a new ground offensive inside Gazaalmost immediately after he left the region. Heavy bombardments killed hundreds of Palestinians over the weekend. Strikes also targeted the strip’s battered hospitals, bringing the total toll from the war inside Gaza to 53,486, most of them civilians. “The fighting is intense and we are making progress. We will take control of all the territory of the Strip,” Netanyahu said in a video posted on Telegram on Monday. The Israeli military declared all of central Khan Younis city a “combat zone”, ordering civilians to leave. Most have been displaced repeatedly, are weakened by hunger and with much of the strip in ruins have nowhere to go. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Smotrich, a far-right critic of any negotiated end to the war, defended Netanyahu’s decision to let in “basic” food aid, saying it would allow Israel to keep its military in Gaza for a campaign of destruction and displacement. “Now we conquer, cleanse and stay – untilHamasis destroyed,” he told a news conference. “Along the way, what remains of the strip is also being wiped out.” “As part of the war, the IDF is moving the population out of combat zones … The population will reach the south of the strip, and from there, with God’s help, move to third countries underPresident Trump’s plan.” Netanyahu claims a military justification for the blockade on Gaza, claiming Hamas steals food aid from humanitarian agencies and the UN. There has been looting of warehouses by armed groups in Gaza, particularly as hunger deepened, but Israeli officials have not published data on how much aid is stolen, or given any examples of supply chains compromised by Hamas. Humanitarian organisations with decades of experience working in conflict zones and heavily audited supply chains say their aid is not being diverted. Israel wants to replace their networks across Gaza with central distribution compounds secured by the Israeli military and operated by armed contractors who will hand out aid in boxes to those who able to walk and carry it. A Swiss-registered start-up, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which Israeli officials describe as a “US initiative”, will manage the compounds when they are operational. Its director, Jake Woods, a former US marine, said the GHF would be “up and running before the end of the month”, but it is not clear who will pay for the aid. The UN and international humanitarian groups who have brought food into Gaza since the war began have said they will not work with GHF, because its armed contractors and links to the Israeli military compromise key principles including neutrality and put staffers at risk. Israeli foreign ministry officials declined to comment on funding. Israel launched the war after cross-border attacks by Hamas killed 1,200 people, the majority civilians. Another 250 were taken hostage, with 58 still in Gaza – but nearly two-thirds of them are thought to be dead.",

    "title": "Reeves hopes hat-trick of deals shows Britain is open for business",
    "article_text": "Rachel Reeves joked to journalists after Monday’s EU-UK reset that trade deals were coming along “like buses”, given the agreements with India and the US that had also been sealed in the past fortnight alone. The chancellor described the EU deal as the best that had been secured by any non-member country, but she was also keen to talk about the three successful negotiations as a package. That is because the government accepts the EU deal will not be transformational for the UK’s growth prospects in itself – boosting GDP by £9bn, or 0.3%, over 15 years, according to officials – but hopes it will persuade investors to take a fresh look at the UK. “It shows Britain now is the place to put investment and business, because we’ve got preferential deals with the biggest economies around the world. And so I’m confident that these deals will lead to investment coming to Britain,” Reeves said.Labourhopes that will help to underpin the growth it sorely needs to fulfil its promises to voters. Three aspects of the EU agreement have been particularly welcomed by business, and form the core of the economic package – although many details remain to be negotiated. The first is the long-hoped-for agreement to create a common sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) area, under whichcumbersome checks on food and agricultural productswill be lifted in return for the UK aligning with EU standards in these areas. Boris Johnson, presentinghis trade and cooperation agreement with the EUon Christmas Eve 2020, wrongly claimed there would be “no non-tariff barriers to trade”. In practice, these barriers – including veterinary checks – have been hugely damaging, and a SPS deal is aimed at dismantling some of them, for this key sector. The British Chambers of Commerce, which has long drawn attention to the frustrations suffered by UK exporters, called the prospect of an SPS agreement “a huge boost” that would “cut costs, reduce waste and increase sales”. Reeves, whenasked whether the UK could take a similar approach to other sectors – aligning on rules in exchange for more frictionless market access – said: “Potentially,” pointing to the fact that the two sides had now agreed to meet annually. The second aspect of the deal that carries economic weight is an agreement to cooperate more closely on energy policy, including aligning the EU and UK emissions trading schemes. That should, the government says, “create the conditions for goods originating in our jurisdictions to benefit from mutual exemptions from the respective EU and UK carbon border adjustment mechanisms (CBAM)”. In practice, the UK government claims that will mean the steel industry escapes £25m a year in levies that the EU would otherwise have imposed, via the CBAM – a policy aimed at ensuring heavily polluting products cannot enter the EU and undercut domestically produced equivalents that have paid to offset their emissions. Government modelling suggests membership of the emissions trading scheme accounts for 0.1% of the 0.3% boost to GDP from the reset, with SPS contributing the other 0.2%. Third, the UK hopes the agreement to negotiate over the possibility of defence industry cooperation will mean UK firms being able to bid for projects procured via the planned EU Security Action ForEurope(SAFE) fund, which will allow member states to borrow to pay for weapons. The language on thisin the EU-UK agreement is scant: the two sides agree to cooperate on “security and defence initiatives, including on defence industry”, and they commit to “swiftly explore any possibilities for mutually beneficial enhanced cooperation created by the SAFE instrument”. But ministers clearly believe this could open the way for UK defence companies such asBAE Systemsto profit, as defence spending ramps up on both sides of the Channel. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion The fury about fishing rights, whichheld up the final agreement, has little to do with economics and everything to do with the political symbolism of the sector. Research by the Resolution Foundation found that fisheries had actually been one of the industries worst affected by Johnson’sBrexitdeal, with output perhaps 30% lower than it might otherwise have been. Given how rapidly fish needs to get to market, Labour argues that eliminating cumbersome food checks under the SPS deal will benefit the sector more than allowing EU boats access to UK waters for another 12 years. (It may also have the positive political side-effect of preventing regular rows about fish from spilling out into the headlines.) Economists say the limited size of the direct GDP boost from the deal results from the government’s clear determination not to rejoin the single market or customs union, in order to avoid having to sign up to the free movement of people. John Springford of the Centre for European Reform, whose analysis suggests the UK economy is approximately 5% smaller than it would otherwise have been as a result of Brexit, suggests that the government’s 0.3% estimate still looks relatively generous. Herecently forecastthat an SPS agreement would add less than 0.1%, for example, against the 0.2% upside modelled by the government. However, as Reeves made clear, Labour hopes the economy will gain something more nebulous, which it is harder to plug into a model: a growing acknowledgment from the business sector that the UK is an appealing investment proposition. Before coming to power, Reeves and Keir Starmer hoped the credibility of a steadier hand on the tiller than the Tories’ would win over investors, whose confidence they see as key to the UK’s recovery. Instead, Labour swept into power on a wave of dire warnings about the state of the economy, blindsided businesses with tax rises, and saw GDP continue to flatline. Now, they hope the triumvirate of theIndia-UK trade deal, theUS tariff agreement with Donald Trumpand the EU reset will burnish their reputation as calm and competent stewards of the economy, helping to generate a glimmer of optimism, in a highly uncertain world.",

    "title": "EU reset deal puts Britain back on the world stage, says Keir Starmer",
    "article_text": "Keir Starmer has vowed his EU reset deal will deliver cheaper food and energy for British people, heralding a “win-win” as he sealed the high-stakes agreement with concessions on youth visas and fishing. “Britain is back on the world stage,” the prime minister said after shaking hands on the deal with the EU’sUrsula von der Leyenin London. “It gives us unprecedented access to the EU market, the best of any country … all while sticking to the red lines in our manifesto.” Von der Leyen described it as “a historic moment … opening a new chapter in our unique relationship”. But attacks came immediately from rightwing parties, which said the deal would make the UK a “rule taker” from Brussels. Starmer emphasised the tangible benefits the deal would do for Britons, including cheaper food in supermarkets and an end to passport queues at European airports witha deal for travellers to use European e-gates. No 10 hopes both can be clinched within a year. The deal also paves the way for the UK’s return to the Erasmus university exchange programme, and the creation of a youth mobility scheme that would allow young people access to the EU through work, study, au pair or travel. UK ministers have insisted the scheme will be capped and time-limited, similar to those deals struck with Australia and New Zealand. But officials said there were hard negotiations yet to be done on whether the capped numbers would be from individual member states or EU-wide. Acknowledgingfor the first time the damage done byBrexitto Britain’s trade, Starmer said the deal to remove restrictions from agrifood trade would give a boost of £9bn to the UK economy. In a government briefing, No 10 said it would redress the 21% drop in exports and 7% drop in imports seen since Brexit. It is the third deal Britain has struck this month, after agreements withIndiaandthe US. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, one of the biggest Europhiles in the cabinet, said Monday’s agreement was “the best deal with the EU for any country” and would show “Britain now is the place to put investment and do business, because we’ve got preferential deals with the biggest economies”. But the price for the trade boost was controversial. The UK will grant EU fishers access to British waters for an additional 12 years, an eleventh-hour concession from the UK three times as long as it had originally offered, which led to cries of betrayal from the Conservatives and industry figures. Boris Johnson, the former prime minister who signed the Brexit deal, said Starmer was “turning this country once again into the orange ball-chewing, leather-trussed gimp”. The National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations said it was “very disappointed” with the deal and that it “surrenders the best prospect that the fishing industry and coastal communities had for growth over the coming decade”. No 10 said the industry would benefit many times over from the export deal which would allow some foods including shellfish to be exported to the EU for the first time since Brexit. The wide-ranging deal struck at the Lancaster House summit on Monday includes: A defence pact as the first step towards securing British access to a new €150bn (£126bn) EU rearmament fund, though the UK will pay into the fund. Faster access for travellers who will be able to use e-gates at airports on the continent, although the timeline is unclear. A landmark emissions-trading deal, meaning UK exporters will avoid £800m of carbon border taxes. Closer cooperation on crime and migration, including access to the EU facial recognition data, a key request from Starmer. UK officials said they had agreed the long-term fishing settlement to give the industry certainty – and that the EU had originally demanded a permanent fishing deal or to time-limit the agrifood deal, which British negotiators refused to accept. Negotiations went late into Sunday night. The final details were offered by UK negotiators at about 10.30pm and negotiations on the language continued until 3am. EU ambassadors met in the early morning to rubber-stamp the three agreed texts. The fraught final hours came after tempers flared in Brussels, particularly when Downing Streetbriefed on Saturday night that the deal was done– but the 12-year fishing deal was not agreed till the following day. Sources suggested that Starmer’s apparent acceptance of a youth mobility deal in an interview on Friday gave EU negotiators an opening to push for further concessions. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion The agrifood deal paves the way for the removal of checks on British food exports, allowing everything from the “great British burger to shellfish” to be sold again with ease in the EU, Starmer said. It crosses one of the totemic red lines of the Brexit negotiations under the Conservatives, accepting dynamic alignment with EU standards and a role for the European court of justice. The change, once formally agreed, will need primary legislation in parliament, though unlike under the Conservatives there is no prospect of Labour MPs holding up the change, though some are uneasy about the deal. Addressing Labour MPs after the summit, Starmer said he would face the political threat from Reform head on, making the case that trade deals would save jobs and put money in people’s pockets. “Reform are our main rivals for power,” he added. “We have a moral responsibility to make sure [Nigel] Farage never wins. We have to be clear that every opportunity he has had in this parliament to back working people he’s voted against. We will take the fight to him. We will fight as Labour.” The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, claimed it would make it “much harder” to get a free trade agreement with the US, where chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef, banned in the EU, are allowed. There is no legal agreement on any of the deals announced and negotiations will now begin on the fine print. But von der Leyen said she hoped that the UK would be able to join the defence agreement “within weeks”. Starmer said he wanted UK holidaymakers to be able to use e-gates in EU countries “as soon as possible”, but the final move will be up to individual states. “There’s no inhibition on this, so I want to see it done quickly,” he said. “For holidaymakers wanting to get out this summer they will want to know that they can do so easily and without delay and chaos.” Badenoch said: “This deal is taking us to the past and that is why we call it surrender.” She stopped short of saying she would rip up the terms of the deal, saying only that she would seek to renegotiate should the Tories return to power. Major supermarkets and food and drink companies hailed the agrifood deal as a gamechanger, though it is expected to make relatively little impact on GDP. The Office for Budget Responsibility has estimated that Brexit reduced the UK economy’s long-term productivity by 4%. Salmon Scotland said it was a “breakthrough that eases the burden on our farmers, processors and the communities they support, and we welcome efforts to implement it at pace”. The NFU, an employers’ association representing British farmers, said the benefits would ultimately depend on how much say the UK had over standards it had to adhere to. “This deal will deliver many benefits for agrifood exports to the EU,” the NFU said. “However, there remain important questions about what is within the scope of this agreement and, where current rules and regulations do differ, if there will be any exclusions.”",

    "title": "Starmer’s post-Brexit reset offers clear benefits – but there is political risk too",
    "article_text": "There were two moments at the UK-EU summit where it felt as if a corner had truly been turned. It was not on agrifoods, nor youth mobility, defence or fishing. WhenKeir Starmersaid the UK had changed, the most symbolic evidence of that came in a press release from No 10 that set out the terms of the agreement brokered at Lancaster House. It acknowledged, for the first time, what successive British governments have spent years denying – thatBrexithas damaged Britain. It laid out the figures: the UK has suffered a “21% drop in exports and 7% drop in imports”. Finally, the charade was over. And the British public know that. Half of Britons now say the decision to leave the EU was the wrong one and significant numbers of those who did not vote or were too young to vote think Brexit was the wrong decision. Poll after poll suggests the British public believe the UK is now worse off – although often that stops short of a demand that the UK rejoin. Second, and equally symbolic, was the acknowledgment that the changes proposed would require a vote in parliament. That confirmation came from No 10 almost as an afterthought. But there was a time not so long ago when the prospect of a vote in parliament on a deal like this would have been the top line of every news story. Gone are the days when Steve Baker or Bill Cash would be on the bulletins crying foul at every line of compromise. Starmer is the first prime minister in more than a decade who doesn’t have to worry about that vote at all, despite some Labour MPs who, in “red wall” seats facing Reform, feel nervous. But most of Starmer’s parliamentary party would probably prefer to see a deal that went even further. There will be no anguished briefings from rebel Conservative Eurosceptics who once in effective held Downing Street hostage and brought down two prime ministers. Kemi Badenoch’s vow to oppose all the changes was irrelevant. It is that radically changed approach and circumstance – referred to time and again by Ursula von der Leyen as she praised “dear Keir” at Monday’s press conference – which has seen this EU reset over the line less than six months after Starmer set the date. But that stability in parliament certainly does not mean that there is no political risk to this deal. There will be a battle on the front pages and the airwaves to set the narrative. Starmer’s main political rival now is not a wounded Tory party but the far more dangerous godfather of Brexit, Nigel Farage. On Monday night, Starmer finally made that case to Labour MPs, vowing that he would fight Farage “as Labour” – a tacit acknowledgment that he has perhaps aped his opponent’s language too much on issue like migration. But he said he would make the case that Reform UK’s plans for Britain would make people poorer, dismissing the Conservatives as no longer Labour’s principle rival. Farage, he said, was “a state-slashing, NHS-privatising Putin apologist. Without a single patriotic bone in his body. We will take the fight to him. We will fight as Labour. “We must repair the social contract. We must unite the country against Reform. We must tackle the cost-of-living crisis. And we must show that we are the party – the only party – that can deliver change for working people,” he added. For Starmer, it will be a race to sell the benefits of his agrifoods and energy deals – cheaper food and cheaper energy bills – combined with quicker queues at the airport for frustrated Britons trying to placate their children as they land from their holidays. Practical delivery versus ideology. From Farage and Badenoch, there are cries of betrayal on two fronts. The first is fishing: a 12-year deal to keep the status quo when the industry had hoped for better terms from 2026. That was the price of a permanent agrifoods deal, worth so much more to the economy but potentially at the expense of such a symbolically important British industry. And the second is the sense that Britain has crossed the Rubicon that makes it a rule-taker, agreeing dynamic alignment on standards and a role for the European court of justice. No 10 is gambling that the public has lost interest in much of the technical aspects of the trade talks, as long as Brexit negotiations do not dominate the media discourse or are not seen to be distracting senior politicians from domestic matters. But there is also a risk of a distracted public – that voters already inclined to feel angry towards the government will see headlines about a “Brexit betrayal” and assume the worst, without reading the details. It is this arena where Farage has always had his greatest success.",

    "title": "As key Israel allies threaten action over Gaza catastrophe, Washington is largely unmoved",
    "article_text": "As Israel orders Palestinians to evacuate Khan Younis in advance of what it calls an “unprecedented attack” on Gaza, much of Washington remains largely unmoved, even as Canada and European countriesthreaten“concrete actions” if Israel does not scale back its offensive. Despitereportsof growing pressure from the Trump administration to increase aid into Gaza, where widespread famine looms, the White House continues to publicly back Israel. National security council spokesperson James Hewitt told the Guardian in an email: “Hamas has rejected repeated ceasefire proposals, and therefore bears sole responsibility for this conflict,” maintaining the policy stance inherited from the previous Biden administration despite mounting evidence of humanitarian catastrophe. The Israeli military on Monday instructed residents of southern Gaza’s Khan Younis to “evacuate immediately” as it prepares to “destroy the capabilities of terrorist organizations” – signalling plans for intensified bombardment in a war that has already claimed more than 53,000 Palestinian lives, according to Gaza’s health ministry. Despite Israeli promises to “flatten” Gaza, opposition from Congress – and mainstream Democrats more broadly – has been largely muted. While the besieged territory faces what the World Health Organization (Who)calls“one of the world’s worst hunger crises”, more than three dozen members of Congress from both parties recently appeared in an American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac)videoin celebration of Israel’s 77th birthday. In New York, leading mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo held up an Israeli flag in the city’s annual Israel Day Parade on Sunday. This political genuflection comes as a MarchGallup pollshows American support for Israel has dropped to 46% – its lowest point in 25 years – while sympathy for Palestinians has risen to a record 33%. Democrats reported sympathizing with Palestinians over Israelis by a three-to-one ratio. On a recentepisodeof The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Senator Bernie Sanders blamed Washington’s reluctance to change course on the financial muscle of lobbying groups. “If you speak up on that issue, you’ll have super Pacs like Aipac going after you,” Sanders said, noting Aipac’s record$14.5m campaignto unseat Democratic representative Jamaal Bowman after he accused Israel of genocide. A small contingent of progressive lawmakers continue to voice opposition despite being largely iced out from public discourse in Washington. Representative Delia Ramirez of Illinois condemned the “lethal, unaccountable, extremist duo” of Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Donald Trump. “Americans have said they do not want to be complicit in their barbaric campaigns. It is time for us in Congress to exercise our power and take action. Not one more cent, not one more bomb, not one more excuse,” she told the Guardian. Representative Ilhan Omar similarly decried the latest chapter of the lopsided war onGaza, calling it “another unconscionable moral stain”. “Despite the fanfare of Donald Trump’s trip [to the Middle East last weak], they’re not closer to a ceasefire,” Omar said. “It is deeply shameful that innocent civilians are continuing to pay the price.” Vermont senator Peter Welch recently led 29 Senate colleagues in introducing a resolution calling on theTrump administrationto end the blockade of humanitarian aid. “It’s been over two months since the Israeli government has been using its power to withhold food, medicine, lifesaving cancer treatments, dialysis systems, formula, and more from starving and suffering families across Gaza,” he said. Resolutions, however, are symbolic gestures meant to publicize opinions and do not have the force of law. While the lawmakers voice their concerns, their impact on policy remains limited, representing the growing disconnect between Washington policymakers and public sentiment. That the grassroots movement for Palestinian rights in the US has grown more subdued – in large part due to an aggressive crackdown by the Trump administration against the universities that were host to last year’s protests – may take some of the pressure off for them to act. One insider familiar with discussions between the US and Israel toldthe Washington Postthat the Americans have been hitting Israel with a tougher stance over the last few weeks. Haaretz has alsoreportedgrowing pressure by the US on Israel to agree to a framework for a temporary ceasefire. “Trump’s people are letting Israel know: ‘We will abandon you if you do not end this war,’” the insider said. Trump and JD Vance both skipped over Israel on recent trips abroad, widely interpreted as a snub of Netanyahu. Netanyahu has announced the resumption of “minimal” humanitarian aid into Gaza, and the UN said on Monday that nine aid trucks were authorised to enter Gaza, a “drop in the ocean” given the scale of desperation. Whether US voices calling for change in US policy and a wind-down of the catastrophic war are just shouting in the void, may become clearer in the coming days.",

    "title": "UK, France and Canada threaten action if Israel’s offensive continues as first aid crosses into Gaza in weeks – as it happened",
    "article_text": "This live blog is now closed. You can read our latest full report here: The leaders ofBritain, FranceandCanadaissued a joint statement on Monday warning that they will take “further concrete actions” ifIsraeldoes not stop a renewed military offensive inGazaand lift aid restrictions. The statement byKeir Starmer, Emmanuel MacronandMark Carneycondemns Israel’s expansion of military operations inGazaas “wholly disproportionate”, adding that the “level of human suffering in Gaza is intolerable”. We will not stand by while the Netanyahu Government pursues these egregious actions. If Israel does not cease the renewed military offensive and lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid, we will take further concrete actions in response. It describes the Israeli government’s “denial of essential humanitarian assistance” as “unacceptable” and says it risks breaching international humanitarian law. In addition, it condemns the “abhorrent” language used by Israeli politicians threatening civilians to relocate from Gaza. The leaders called on the Israeli government to stop its military operations in Gaza and immediately allow humanitarian aid to enter the Palestinian territory. It’s just past 10pm inGazaand Tel Aviv. Here’s a recap of the latest developments: Nine aid trucks were authorised to enter Gaza through the Kerem Shalom crossing after 11 weeks of a complete blockade, a mere “drop in the ocean of what is urgently needed”,the UN’s humanitarian chief, Tom Fletcher, said on Monday. Five trucks carrying baby food and other desperately needed aid entered Gaza, according to the Israeli defense body in charge of coordinating aid to Gaza, COGAT. The UN has long said Gaza needs at least 500 trucks every day. Benjamin Netanyahu said the aid that would be let into Gaza would be “minimal” as he announced thatIsraelplans to take control of all of Gaza.The Israeli leader, in a video message on Monday, said while Israel was deploying “massive force to take control of all of the Gaza Strip … we cannot reach a point of starvation, for practical and diplomatic reasons.” At least 136 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes over the past 24 hours, Gaza’s health ministry said on Monday.The overall Palestinian death toll from Israeli attacks in Gaza is now at 53,486, according to the ministry. Two million people are starving in Gaza while tonnes of food are being blocked at the border “just minutes away”,the head of the World Health Organization,Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus,has said. The WHO has said around a quarter of the 2.1m population in Gaza are facing “a catastrophic situation of hunger, acute malnutrition, starvation, illness and death” due to the Israeli blockade. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) ordered residents living in southern Gaza’s Khan Younis, Bani Suheila and Abasan to “evacuate immediately” ahead of an “unprecedented attack”.A statement from the IDF’s Arabic spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, said Israeli forces “will launch an unprecedented attack to destroy the capabilities of terrorist organisations in this area.” Israel’s restarting of “minimal” aid deliveries to Gaza comes after the Trump administration warned it would “abandon” Israel if it did not end the war in Gaza,according to a Washington Post report. A US official later denied the report, claiming “the idea that we would abandon Israel is preposterous.” The leaders of Britain, France and Canada threatened “further concrete actions” if Israel does not stop a renewed military offensive in Gaza and lift aid restrictions.The statement byKeir Starmer, Emmanuel MacronandMark Carneyon Monday condemns Israel’s expansion of military operations in Gaza as “wholly disproportionate”, adding that the “level of human suffering in Gaza is intolerable”. A joint statement by 22 countries demanded that Israel immediately “allow a full resumption of aid into Gaza”.Foreign ministers from countries including the UK, Australia and Germany also sharply rejected a reported Israeli plan to replace the previous system of delivering aid into Gaza. The UK’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, said that the situation in Gaza is “intolerable”.Starmer said: “It is a really serious, unacceptable, intolerable situation. That’s why we are working intensely to coordinate with other leaders how we respond to this.” European Commission presidentUrsula von der Leyencalled for the blockade to be lifted, adding that “humanitarian aid must never been politicised.” Israel’s hardline minister for national security, Itamar Ben-Gvir, said Netanyahu is “making a grave mistake” by allowing any humanitarian aid to enter Gaza, which Israel has been blockading.Ben-Gvir said “any humanitarian aid that enters the Strip … will fuel Hamas and give it oxygen while our hostages languish in tunnels.” The Israeli army targeted a warehouse storing medical supplies at the Nasser medical complex in southern Gaza’s Khan Younis on Monday.The World Health Organization (WHO), citing the hospital director, said about 30% of the warehouse as well as critical WHO supplies, including IV fluids and dialysis solutions were reportedly destroyed. The attack reportedly happened while Palestinians who were injured or killed in other Israeli airstrikes were being brought to the hospital. AUSofficial has denieda reportciting an unnamed source who claimed the Trump administration would “abandon”Israelif it did not end the war in Gaza. “The idea that we would abandonIsraelis preposterous,” the US official said, according to the Times of Israel. Wereported earlierthat the leaders of theUK, FranceandCanadaissued a joint statement threatening “concrete actions” if Israel does not stop a renewed military offensive inGazaand lift aid restrictions. A separate joint statement by 22 countries on Monday has demanded thatIsraelimmediately “allow a full resumption of aid into Gaza”. The statement came as the UNsaid nine aid trucks were authorised to enter Gaza,describing it as a “drop in the ocean” amid the territory’s humanitarian crisis. “Whilst we acknowledge indications of a limited restart of aid, Israel blocked humanitarian aid enteringGazafor over two months,” the statement reads. The statement sharply rejects a reported Israeli plan to replace the previous system of delivering aid into Gaza, noting that the UN and humanitarian partners have opposed the plan. The statement goes on: We have two straightforward messages for the Government of Israel: allow a full resumption of aid into Gaza immediately and enable the UN and humanitarian organisations to work independently and impartially to save lives, reduce suffering and maintain dignity. Benjamin Netanyahu’s announcement thatIsraelwill restart “minimal” aid deliveries toGazacomes after public and behind-the-scenes pressure from the Trump administration, according to a report. A sourcetoldthe Washington Post: Trump’s people are letting Israel know, ‘We will abandon you if you do not end this war. An Israeli attack onNasser hospitalin southern Gaza’sKhan Younisearlier today “severely damaged” a warehouse built by theWorld Health Organization (WHO),according to the hospital director. About 30% of the warehouse as well as critical WHO supplies, including IV fluids and dialysis solutions were reportedly destroyed. An assessment by hospital management is underway to determine the full scale of the loss, the WHO said in a statement on X. Amid critical shortages, escalating violence, and a rising number of casualties, this is a devastating blow that will cost lives. WHO reiterates: Health care must be protected. Hospitals must never be militarized or targeted. The joint statement by the leaders ofBritain, FranceandCanadagoes on to say that they oppose any attempt to expandIsraelisettlements in theWest Bank. It calls on Israel to stop these settlements, which the statement says are illegal and “undermine the viability of a Palestinian state and the security of both Israelis and Palestinians.” It says the three countries “will not hesitate to take further action, including targeted sanctions”. The statement byKeir Starmer, Emmanuel MacronandMark Carneysays they “strongly” support the efforts led by the US, Qatar and Egypt to secure an immediate ceasefire inGaza. “These negotiations need to succeed,” it says. The statement concludes: We are committed to recognising a Palestinian state as a contribution to achieving a two-state solution and are prepared to work with others to this end. The leaders ofBritain, FranceandCanadaissued a joint statement on Monday warning that they will take “further concrete actions” ifIsraeldoes not stop a renewed military offensive inGazaand lift aid restrictions. The statement byKeir Starmer, Emmanuel MacronandMark Carneycondemns Israel’s expansion of military operations inGazaas “wholly disproportionate”, adding that the “level of human suffering in Gaza is intolerable”. We will not stand by while the Netanyahu Government pursues these egregious actions. If Israel does not cease the renewed military offensive and lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid, we will take further concrete actions in response. It describes the Israeli government’s “denial of essential humanitarian assistance” as “unacceptable” and says it risks breaching international humanitarian law. In addition, it condemns the “abhorrent” language used by Israeli politicians threatening civilians to relocate from Gaza. The leaders called on the Israeli government to stop its military operations in Gaza and immediately allow humanitarian aid to enter the Palestinian territory. United Nations aid chief Tom Fletcher saidIsraelcleared nine trucks of aid on Monday to enter Gaza through the Keren Shalom crossing after 11 weeks of a complete blockade, Reuters reported.“But it is a drop in the ocean of what is urgently needed, and significantly more aid must be allowed intoGaza, starting tomorrow morning,” Fletcher said in a statement. An Israeli official says a shipment of flour, baby food and medical supplies will be allowed into Gaza.Eden Bar Tal, the foreign ministry’s director general, said the baby food had started entering, but there was no sign of any aid on theGazaside of the border. He did not say how much aid would enter, where it would enter or when. The aid that would be let into Gaza would be “minimal,” Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, without specifying precisely when it would resume.He said it would act as bridge toward the launch of a new aid system inGaza, in which a US-backed organisation will distribute assistance in hubs that will be secured by the Israeli military. Israel’s hardline minister for national security, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has said that Benjamin Netanyahu is “making a grave mistake” by allowing any humanitarian aid to enter Gaza, whichIsraelhas been blockading.Ben-Gvir said “The prime minister is making a grave mistake with this move. Any humanitarian aid that enters the Strip … will fuel Hamas and give it oxygen while our hostages languish in tunnels.” In a post on X, the IDF’s Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee has told residents living in southern Gaza’s Khan Younis, Bani Suheila and Abasan to “evacuate immediately” ahead of an “unprecedented attack” he claims is targeting Hamas infrastructure.“The IDF will launch an unprecedented attack to destroy the capabilities of terrorist organisations in this area,” he wrote in the social media post. Gaza’s health ministry says 136 people have died in Israeli strikes over the past 24 hours.The ministry says 136 bodies were brought toGazahospitals over the past 24 hours. The head of a French medical humanitarian organisation operating in Gaza says the US-backed group expected to distribute aid in the besieged territory will be an accessory to a massive displacement of the Palestinian population as planned byIsrael.Jean-Francois Corty, president of Medicins du Monde, a France-based medical humanitarian organisation, sharply criticised plans by Israel, backed by the US, to use a private contractor,GazaHumanitarian Foundation, to distribute aid in Gaza. Khan Younis residents said Israeli special forces disguised as displaced Palestinians launched a rare ground raid into the city.The forces killed Ahmed Sarhan, a leader in the armed wing of the Popular Resistance Committees, in a shootout, the group said. Palestinian witnesses said his wife and daughter were detained. The UK’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, has said that the situation inGazais “intolerable”.During a joint press conference with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, Starmer said: “It is a really serious, unacceptable, intolerable situation. That’s why we are working intensely to coordinate with other leaders how we respond to this. We will continue to work in that way.” Amnesty International has urged the US to investigate possible violations of international law in regards to a deadly airstrike on a migrant detention facility in Yemen last month, in which 68 African migrants were reported to have been killed.At the time, the Iran-backed Houthi rebels, which governs north-west Yemen,saidthe migrant centre in the city of Saada was under the supervision of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the Red Cross and targeting it constituted “a full-fledged war crime”. United Nations aid chief Tom Fletcher saidIsraelcleared nine trucks of aid on Monday to enter Gaza through the Keren Shalom crossing after 11 weeks of a complete blockade, Reuters reported. “But it is a drop in the ocean of what is urgently needed, and significantly more aid must be allowed intoGaza, starting tomorrow morning,” Fletcher said in a statement. “To reduce looting, there must be a regular flow of aid, and humanitarians must be permitted to use multiple routes. Commercial goods should complement the humanitarian response,” he said. The head of a French medical humanitarian organisation operating in Gaza says the US-backed group expected to distribute aid in the besieged territory will be an accessory to a massive displacement of the Palestinian population as planned byIsrael. Jean-Francois Corty, president of Medicins du Monde, a France-based medical humanitarian organsation, sharply criticised plans by Israel, backed by the US, to use a private contractor,GazaHumanitarian Foundation, to distribute aid in Gaza. The plans, as they are known so far, involve setting up four distribution hubs where Palestinians would have to go to collect food guarded by armed private contractors and near Israeli military positions. It appears three of the four hubs will be in Rafah in the far south of Gaza and one in central Gaza, meaning much of the population will have to move to Rafah to obtain aid. Israeli authorities have been pressing for Palestinians to evacuate south. Corty said GHF is “operating for American and Israeli authorities” and is “working for this project to support the massive deportation of the population which is planned by these authorities.” Displaced Palestinians flee from Khan Younis,Gaza. Khan Younis residents said Israeli special forces disguised as displaced Palestinians launched a rare ground raid into the city. The forces killed Ahmed Sarhan, a leader in the armed wing of the Popular Resistance Committees, in a shootout, the group said. Palestinian witnesses said his wife and daughter were detained. The forces drove in on a civilian vehicle and carried out the raid under cover from heavy airstrikes. At least five other people were killed, in addition to Sarhan, according to Nasser hospital. An Israeli official says a shipment of flour, baby food and medical supplies will be allowed into Gaza. Eden Bar Tal, the foreign ministry’s director general, said the baby food had started entering, but there was no sign of any aid on theGazaside of the border. He did not say how much aid would enter, where it would enter or when. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would allow some aid to enter Gaza for the first time in nearly three months under pressure from Israel’s allies. Aid groups say hunger is widespread and have warned of famine if Israel does not lift its blockade on Gaza’s 2m Palestinians. The IDF told residents living in southern Gaza’s Khan Younis, Bani Suheila and Abasan to “evacuate immediately” ahead of an “unprecedented attack” on Monday. The IDF’s Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee claimed the attack was targeting Hamas infrastructure and that the area would be considered a ‘dangerous combat zone’. It comes a day afterIsraelallowed the entry of a ‘basic quantity’ of food into Gaza, after coming under international criticism over its 10-week blockade on food and humanitarian aid Palestinians make their way with belongings as they flee their homes after the Israeli military issued orders for evacuation from eastern Khan Younis.",

    "article_text": "AMicrosoftemployee disrupted a keynote speech by the company’s chief executive with a pro-Palestinian protest at the company’s annual developer conference on Monday. Joe Lopez, aMicrosoftfirmware engineer who worked on parts of the company’s cloud-computing platform, Azure, was escorted out the Build conference by security nearly immediately after he confronted Satya Nadella. “Satya, how about you show how Microsoft is killing Palestinians,” Lopez yelled. “How about you show how Israeli war crimes are powered by Azure?” After the disruption, Lopez sent an all-staff email explaining his decision to stage a protest. “As one of the largest companies in the world, Microsoft has immeasurable power to do the right thing: demand an end to this senseless tragedy, or we will cease our technological support for Israel,” read the email,which has also been published on Medium. “If leadership continues to ignore this demand, I promise that it won’t go unnoticed. The world has already woken up to our complicity and is turning against us. The boycotts will increase and our image will continue to spiral into disrepair.” Organizers with a worker-led group called No Azure for Apartheid (Noaa) also organized a protest to coincide with the developer conference. The group has been protesting against Microsoft’s AI and cloud-computing contracts with the Israeli military for over a year. The company’s Azure cloud software has been found to have enabledIsraeli surveillanceof Palestinians and been used by the Israeli air force’sOfek Unit, the unit which manages databases of potential targets for lethal airstrikes. Leaked documents also show that Microsoft has a “footprint in all major military infrastructures” in Israel, according to +972 Magazine. “One year ago, workers launched theNo Azure for Apartheid campaign and petitionin a state of urgency after 7 months of genocide,” wrote Anna Hattle, a Microsoft worker and organizer with Noaa, in an email to company leadership on 15 May. “We are currently witnessing the samecrimes committed 77 years agowith one key difference: now, the Israeli Occupation Forces are carrying out this genocide at a much greater scale thanks to Microsoft cloud and AI technology.” Sign up toTechScape A weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives after newsletter promotion Lopez’s demonstration is the second of its kind in just the last two months. On 6 April, two Microsoft workers, Ibtihal Aboussad and Vaniya Agrawal,disrupted a Microsoft AI eventand called the company’s AI chief, Mustafa Suleyman, a war profiteer. Both workers have since been fired. The status of Lopez’s job could not be determined. Google saw similarinternal protests and mass firingslast year over its contracts with the Israeli military and government. In response to the reporting on Microsoft technology’s use by the Israeli military, Microsoft said that athird-party investigationfound “no evidence” that its technology was used to harm or target people. The activist group, Noaa, disputes the company’s conclusion. The company did not immediately comment on Lopez’s demonstration. “Leadership rejects our claims that Azure technology is being used to target or harm civilians in Gaza. Those of us who have been paying attention know that this is a bold-faced lie,” Lopez wrote in his all-staff email. “We don’t need an internal audit to know that a top Azure customer is committing crimes against humanity. We see it live on the internet every day.” Lopez’s protest comes just days after Palestinians marked 77 years since the Nakba, the Arabic word for catastrophe used to describe the when an estimated 750,000 Palestinians were forced to flee or were expelled from their homes in 1948.",

    "title": "Village where Israelis and Palestinians live together to promote peace faces planned tax on funds",
    "article_text": "An Israeli village where Jews and Palestinians live together to promote peace is in danger of losing vital overseas funding following Israeli government proposals to impose an 80% tax on foreign donations, residents have warned. Leading figures from the unique community – Wahat Salam/Neve Shalom, which translates as “Oasis of Peace” – flew to the UK this week in a visit hosted by the Co-operative Group, which is calling for the UK government to support peace-building cooperatives worldwide with foreign and development policy. Samah Salaime, an Israeli Palestinian, and Nir Sharon, an Israeli Jew, co-direct the village’s educational institutions, which include the School for Peace for activists and a primary school where 250 Jewish and Palestinian children learn each other’s histories, in Arabic and Hebrew. The co-directors addressed a parliamentary round table, attended by Labour and Co-operative MPs and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) on Tuesday, in a visit coinciding with the 77th anniversary of theNakba,when more than 700,000 Palestinians were dispossessed. On Saturday, the pair addressed the Co-operative Group’s annual general meeting in Manchester. Before the meeting, Salaime told the Guardian of the threat posed by a billbeing debatedin Israel’s Knesset. If it became law, it would decimate the finances of NGOs in Israel that receive funding from foreign states. “All support from foreign countries for the peacemakers of the left, the liberal and the democratic; humanitarian aid or legal aid for the Palestinians, will be taxed 80% from foreign countries,” she said. “Thebiggest supportersfor Wahat Salam come from the UK, from the Co-op, our friends in Switzerland, in Sweden, in the US. We don’t have any local Israeli support for our project … financially and ideologically, they are against us.” Sharon added: “We faced financial problems and challenges in the past, but if this law passes, we will be in severe problems, most of our education projects will just shut down.” Conceived by Bruno Hussar, a Jewish Catholic priest,the villagestarted with a handful of residents in 1978, in “no man’s land” between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. It now has 300 residents, half Israeli Palestinians and half Israeli Jews, including academics and tech professionals, with a waiting list of about 200 families. There is no synagogue or mosque: instead, residents pray or meditate in a dome called the Court of Silence. Surrounded by olive trees, communal life in the village revolves around committee meetings where the co-operative’s decisions are voted on, shared meals, the swimming pool and the Garden of Rescuers, which commemorates heroes of global catastrophes. There is a guesthouse in the village, and children from surrounding areas are bussed in to attend the school. Salaime said: “We were attacked by settlers three times. We had two arson attacks in 2021. They set fire to our peace school, and we rebuilt it and the peace library. They attacked the primary school, destroying 16 vehicles … we have all kinds of unfortunate incidents, and we survive.” Salaime, a social worker and feminist of the “third generation of the Nakba”, moved to the village from East Jerusalem in 2000, five days before the second intifada, looking for a “decent school”. Her three sons have grown up with Jewish friends, facing the “complexity” of a “soulmate” agreeing to serve in the Israel Defense Forces. When her home came within a range of rockets from Gaza, Salaime reassured her mother that she could use her Jewish neighbour’s shelter. “We break the rules, we break the stereotype, the brainwashing of the Israeli mainstream that peace isn’t possible,” Salaime said. “We have to win this and offer a different agenda.” Sharon was 14 when his parents moved to the village 23 years ago and said it gives “isolated lefties, Jewish peacemakers and activists” a place to “coexist”. “We are not some kind of utopia, where everything is perfect and there is no debate,” he said. “When there is October 7 and the war, we have to talk about it.” Leading theCo-op’s peace-building campaign,Paul Gerrard, Co-op Group’s policy director, said the village was a “breathtaking example of where people come together around a goal, in that cooperative way, they can survive and they can thrive”.",

    "title": "Bees face new threats from wars, street lights and microplastics, scientists warn",
    "article_text": "War zones, microplastics and street lights are among the emerging threats to thebee population, according to scientists. Bee experts have drawn up a list of the 12 most pressing threats to the pollinator over the next decade, published in a report, Emerging Threats and Opportunities for Conservation of Global Pollinators, by the University of Reading. Increasing war and conflict around the world is harming bees, the scientists warn. This includes the war inUkraine, which has forced countries to grow fewer crop types, leaving pollinators without diverse food throughout the season. The researchers found microplastic particles were contaminating beehives across Europe, with testing from 315 honey bee colonies revealing synthetic materials such as PET plastic in most hives. Artificial light from street lamps has been found to reduce flower visits by nocturnal pollinators by 62%, and air pollution has been found to affect their survival, reproduction and growth. Antibiotics, used in agriculture, have made their way into beehives and honey. They have also been found to affect the behaviour of pollinators including reducing their foraging and visits to flowers. Pesticide “cocktails” also play a significant and emerging role; although some pesticides are now regulated to be kept below “safe” limits for bees and other wildlife, research has found they can interact with other chemicals and cause dangerous effects. Sign up toDown to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion Prof Simon Potts of Reading University, the lead author on the report, said: “Identifying new threats and finding ways to protect pollinators early is key to preventing further major declines. This is not just a conservation issue. Pollinators are central to our food systems, climate resilience and economic security. Protecting pollinators means protecting ourselves.” The authors have called for a number of measures to protect bees, including stronger laws limiting antibiotic pollution that harms bee health, transitioning to electric vehicles to reduce air pollution affecting pollinators, creating flower-rich habitats within solar parks, and breeding crops with enhanced pollen and nectar for better pollinator nutrition. The report’s co-author Dr Deepa Senapathi, also from the University of Reading, added: “It will take effort from everyone to address these threats. We need to maintain, manage and improve our natural habitats to create safe spaces for pollinators. Individual actions like providing food and nesting areas in our own back gardens can help in a big way. But policy changes and individual actions must work together so everything from gardens and farms to public spaces and wider landscapes can all become pollinator-friendly habitats.”",

    "title": "UK ‘the sick person of the wealthy world’ amid increase in deaths from drugs and violence",
    "article_text": "The UK is becoming “the sick person of the wealthy world” because of the growing number of people dying from drugs, suicide and violence, research has found. Death rates among under-50s in the UK have got worse in recent years compared with many other rich countries, an international study shows. While mortality from cancer and heart disease has decreased, the number of deaths from injuries, accidents and poisonings has gone up, and got much worse for use of illicit drugs. The trends mean Britain is increasingly out of step with other well-off nations, most of which have had improvements in the numbers of people dying from such causes. The increase in drug-related deaths has been so dramatic that the rate of them occuring in the UK was three times higher in 2019 – among both sexes – than the median of 21 other countries studied. The findings are contained in a report by theHealthFoundation thinktank, based on an in-depth study of health and death patterns in the 22 nations by academics at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM). “The UK’s health is fraying,” they concluded. The UK’s rising mortality is especially evident among people of working age, aged 25 to 49. Deaths among women that age rose by 46% and among men by 31%, between 1990 and 2023. In contrast, mortality has fallen in 19 of the 21 other countries studied, with only the US and Canada showing the same rise as the UK. Britain now has the fourth highest overall female mortality and sixth highest overall male mortality rate among the 22 nations. The US topped both league tables. Jennifer Dixon, the Health Foundation’s chief executive, said: “This report is a health check we can’t afford to ignore – and the diagnosis is grim. “The UK is becoming the sick person of the wealthy world, especially for people of working age. While other nations moved forward, we stalled – and in some areas slipped badly behind.” Dixon pointed out the improvement in UK death rates since 1990 slowed significantly during the 2010s, with the austerity policies pursued by the coalition government after 2010 a significant factor. Smoking, alcohol misuse and bad diet also help explain Britain’s increasingly sick population. By 2023, women in the UK had a 14% higher death rate than the median in the other countries, while among men of all ages it was 9%. Prof David Leon, who led the research at LSHTM, said: “What is particularly disturbing about our findings is that the risk of dying among adults in the prime of life – those who have not yet got to the age of 50 – has been increasing in the UK for over a decade, while in most other countries it has declined. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion “This is shocking as most mortality between the ages of 25 and 49 years is in principle avoidable.” Office for National Statistics figures show that 5,448 people died as a result of drug poisoning in England and Wales in 2023 – 11% up on the year before and the highest figure since records began in 1993. The rate of such deaths in 2023 – 93 per million population – was double the 43.5 per 100,000 that occurred as recently as 2012, which underlines the sharp increase in drug mortality. Mortality due to suicide has also risen but alcohol-related deaths plateaued for women and fell for men between 2009 and 2019, the thinktank found. The Local Government Association and WithYou, a drugs charity, called for the government to make it easier for drug users, people close to them and health professionals to access and use naloxone, an emergency antidote to overdoses involving heroin, methadone and other drugs. Robin Pollard, WithYou’s head of policy and influencing, said: “We also know getting people into structured treatment is critical to reduce the numbers of drug deaths, and so we continue to call for easier access to higher-quality opiate substitution treatment.” A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Every death from the misuse of drugs is a tragedy. This government is committed to reducing drug-related deaths and supporting more people into recovery to live healthier, longer lives. We remain on high alert to emerging drug threats, including from synthetic opioids.” In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

    "title": "One in four pupils in England ‘disengage’ when they move to secondary, report finds",
    "article_text": "One in four pupils in England “disengage” when they move up to secondary school, with enjoyment, trust and a sense of feeling safe declining sharply, according to a new report. After a largely positive experience at primary school where children report high levels of enjoyment, there is a “steep and lasting” drop in engagement after year 7 when pupils transfer to secondary at the age of 11, the survey of 100,000 pupils in England reveals. Girls are more likely to complain of feeling unsafe or worried, while pupils eligible for free school meals are more likely to report lower levels of trust, enjoyment and belonging – a gap which grows throughout secondary school. The study, published on Tuesday, says lower levels of engagement are linked to absenteeism – a key concern for government after Covid – with the top 25% most engaged secondary pupils 10 percentage points less likely to be persistently absent than those in the bottom 25%. It also finds that primary school pupils are more likely to have a greater sense of agency and believe hard work at school will lead to success compared with secondary pupils, scoring 8.4 out of 10 compared with 6.8 for older students. The research tracked how pupil engagement changed across the 2024–25 academic year and found pupils’ average school enjoyment score drops from about 6.0 in year 6 to 3.8 in year 7, which then falls further to 3.2 in year 8. A sense of feeling safe falls from 7.2 in year 7 to 5.9 in year 9 among female pupils, compared with a decline from 7.4 to 6.6 for male pupils. Almost every country with available data sees a decline in engagement as children advance through school, but the report says it is more pronounced in England, “suggesting that disengagement is not just a symptom of age, but something atypical happening in our context”. The findings come from the Research Commission on Engagement and Lead Indicators (RCELI), led by theImpactEdgroup in partnership with the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), the Confederation of School Trusts (CST), and other education organisations. The commission chair, Sue John, said: “It is crucial that we identify the points at which pupils are starting to disengage with school, so that we can intervene to stop a disconnection leading to non-attendance and poorer outcomes. “This research provides rich and nuanced insights into pupil engagement at a school and classroom level, which will enable leaders to act fast and understand more complex dynamics in their schools, such as what is happening at age 11 for different pupil groups.” Margaret Mulholland, Special educational needs and disabilities (Send) and inclusion specialist at the ASCL, said: “The transition between primary and secondary school is a hugely important stage of a child’s education. “It can also be an unsettling time where issues with anxiety and behaviour can arise. As this study shows, a drop in engagement during this period can be hugely detrimental to a pupil’s wellbeing and attainment.” Leora Cruddas, chief executive of the CST, added: “There are many factors beyond schools which may be contributing to this picture. We need to delve deeper into what the factors are that are driving this disengagement and how we might reconnect these pupils with schooling.”",

    "article_text": "A 17-year-old boy has been charged in connection with the death of Kayden Moy, 16, who died after a “targeted” attack on a Scottish beach. Police were called to reports of a teenager being seriously injured at Irvine beach in North Ayrshire on Saturday at about 6.45pm. Kayden, of East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, was taken to Crosshouse hospital near Kilmarnock, East Ayrshire, but died during the early hours of Sunday morning. The 17-year-old was arrested, later charged, and is due to appear in Kilmarnock sheriff court on Tuesday. The force said inquiries were continuing. In a statement released to the media, Kayden’s family said: “Kayden will be sorely missed by his parents and two younger brothers. “He was loved by so many and that is shown in the huge number of heartfelt messages we have received since his death. “We would like to thank everyone who has shown us support over these last few days.” DCI Campbell Jackson of Police Scotland’s major investigations team said: “Our thoughts remain with Kayden’s family at this very difficult time. Specially trained officers are continuing to support Kayden’s family. “We believe this was a targeted attack and there is no risk to the wider public. “We have a dedicated team of officers working on this investigation and I am again asking anyone who may have information which could help us and who has not yet come forward to please contact us. “No matter how small it may seem, it may be the key piece we need. I would like to thank the community in both Irvine and East Kilbride for their support so far.” Supt Jim McMillan added: “This was a shocking and deeply upsetting incident for not just those at Irvine beach on Saturday, but for Kayden’s family, friends and the wider communities affected. We are engaging with the communities in both Irvine and East Kilbride. “There continues to be a police presence in the area and additional patrols will be carried out where required. I would urge anyone with question or concern to approach a local officer – they are there to help.” Kayden was a pupil at Duncanrig secondary school in East Kilbride. On behalf of the school, its headteacher, Annette Alexander, paid tribute to the teenager. She said: “We are deeply shocked and saddened by the sudden passing of our former pupil, Kayden Moy. “Kayden was a kind and caring young man and full of character. He touched the lives of many within our school community.” The 16-year-old was a former youth player for Busby AFC where those involved in the club have been left “devastated” by his death. In a statement posted on social media, the club said: “Kayden played in our youth set-up for several years and it has hit everyone hard.” The club has set up a GoFundMe appeal in memory of the teenager, which has already raised more than £9,200. A South Lanarkshire council spokesperson said: “This has been a tragic event and our profound sympathies go out to Kayden’s loved ones. “We are very much aware that it will have a wider impact on many people, including a number of our pupils.” Police said several people were believed to have been filming on their phones around the time of the incident and have urged anyone with information or footage to come forward as investigations continue.

    "title": "Ex-deputy in California repays $3,500 in cash he stole from homeless man",
    "article_text": "A former sheriff’s deputy who stole $3,500 from a homeless man he arrested inCaliforniahas been permanently banned from serving as a peace officer in the state, while felony theft charges against him were dropped, authorities said. John Sanzone, a former deputy with the Glenn county sheriff’s office, arrested a homeless man who had been carrying $3,500 – money the man had been saving for urgent dental work. Sanzone took the money and later tried to cover up the theft when the man attempted to reclaim it after his release. “Sanzone went so far as to drive the homeless man to another county,” reads a statement by the Glenn county sheriff’s office posted onFacebook. In May 2023, authoritiesannouncedthat Sanzone had surrendered to the Glenn county jail under an arrest warrant. He was charged with grand theft by embezzlement and later released after posting bail. Officials said Friday that Sanzone has since repaid the $3,500 and surrendered his peace officer certification, effectively barring him from law enforcement inCalifornia. In exchange, felony charges against him were dismissed. People on social media did not take the news lightly. “So a cop steals 3500 and gets let off with no charges lol wow only in glenn county,” one Facebook user commented. “Just shows the actual level of corruption in this county when a cop steals from a homeless man and walks free,” another wrote. The Glenn county sheriff’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Sanzone was previously named in a lawsuit against the Oroville police department alleging racial discrimination within the department, according toABC7. The suit claims that another officer witnessed citizens make complaints about Sanzone, mentioning other four incidents in which Sanzone stole money from citizens he had arrested.",

    "title": "Comey says ‘8647’ post that caused Trump firestorm was totally innocent",
    "article_text": "James Comey was taking a walk on the beach with his wife when they happened upon a message in the sand: 8647. According to the formerFBIdirector, his wife initially asked if the cryptic seashell formation was an address. They puzzled over the shells, trying to decipher meaning. His wife, according to Comey’s account, remembered her days as a server in a restaurant, when 86 was the term staff used to remove an item from the menu. Comey mused that when he was younger, kids would say 86 to mean “to ditch a place”. “I said: ‘That’s really clever,’” Comey recounted, in a Monday interview on MSNBC, describing the events of last week that led him to post a photo of the seashells on Instagram,leading to a firestorm of accusationsfrom Trump allies that he was calling for violence against the president. “I posted it on my Instagram account and thought nothing more of it, until I heard through her that people were saying it was some sort of a call for assassination, which is crazy,” he said. Amid the uproar, Comey deleted the post, and issued a statement saying it was not meant as a call for violence. “Even if I think it’s crazy,” Comey said on MSNBC. “I don’t want to be associated with violence of any kind.” To “86”is common slangfor stopping or getting rid of something, while “47” could be seen as a reference to Trump, the 47th president. Comey had gone to the beach for a moment of respite before the publication of his forthcoming legal thriller FDR Drive: A Crime Novel. Instead he got a call from the Secret Service, who had opened an investigation into the post. Comey, who was fired by Trump in his first term, appeared voluntarily at the Washington field office for an interview, after the president insisted there was no innocent reading of the message. “He knew exactly what that meant. A child knows what that meant,” Trump said. “If you’re the FBI director and you don’t know what that meant, that meant assassination. And it says it loud and clear.” In the interview on Monday,Comey appeared nonplussed by the investigation. “It’s not my first rodeo,” he said, noting his tempestuous relationship with Trump which Comey said deteriorated after he rebuffed Trump’s early attempts to secure a pledge of loyalty from the then FBI director. The agency is now led by Kash Patel, whose abiding loyalty has raised urgent questions about the FBI’s independence. But Comey warned that the episode pointed to a more worrying trend by this administration: “The use of power to aim at individuals, eroding the rule of law.” His advice to others who may find themselves on the receiving end of Trump’s retribution? “The rule of law is still our saving grace,” Comey said. “We have a judiciary in this country that will support the truth. Take solace in that. Take prudent steps, but don’t freak out. These people are not good enough for you to be freaked out about. Protect yourself, be measured about the effect the threat has on you, and know that you’re going to be OK.”",

    "title": "US top court allows Trump admin to revoke protected status for Venezuelans",
    "article_text": "Washington, DC –The United States Supreme Court has enabled the administration of President Donald Trump to revoke the protectedimmigration statusof about 350,000 Venezuelans. The top court’s justices issued a brief order on Monday, granting the administration’s request for lifting the suspension that had been placed by a lower court in March. In February, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem terminated a 2023 Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation for Venezuelans that had been issued by the administration of former President Joe Biden. TPS is a programme that shields noncitizens already in the US on a temporary basis from deportation and allows them to seek a work permit if the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) deems their home country to be unsafe to return to. Millions of people have fled Venezuela in recent years due to political repression and a crippling economic crisis spurred in part by US sanctions against the government of PresidentNicolas Maduro. The Supreme Court did not elaborate on why it sided with the Trump administration on Monday. The ruling simply added that liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson “would deny” the government’s request. The DHS had argued that TPS designations are not subject to judicial review. Noem had declared the 2023 designation for Venezuela “contrary to the national interest”, citing gang membership and “adverse effects on US workers”. However, she kept a previous TPS issued for Venezuelans in place. DHS welcomed the ruling on Monday, sayingwithout evidencethat the Biden administration granted TPS to “gang members” and “known terrorists and murderers”. “The Trump Administration is reinstituting integrity into our immigration system to keep our homeland and its people safe,” the agency said in a social media post. Several Democrats described the push to deport Venezuelans – part of a borderimmigration crackdown– as cruel, rejecting the Trump administration’s allegation that people under the TPS designation are criminals and “terrorists”. “Venezuelans face extreme oppression, arbitrary detention, extrajudicial killings and torture,” Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal said in a statement. “Poverty levels are surging, and essentials like electricity, water and medical care are scarce. The dire circumstances in Venezuela make it clear that this is exactly the type of situation that requires the government to provide TPS.”",

    "title": "El Salvador arrests prominent human rights lawyer who defends deportees",
    "article_text": "A prominent human rights lawyer known for defending immigrants deported amid United States President Donald Trump’s hardline anti-immigration policies has been arrested in El Salvador. Ruth Eleonora López, 47, a senior figure at the rights group Cristosal and a vocal critic of El Salvador’s president,Nayib Bukele, a Trump ally, was detained late on Sunday. The arrest was confirmed by the country’s attorney general’s office, which inan online postaccused López of embezzling state funds during her time at El Salvador’s electoral court more than a decade ago. “Neither her family nor her legal team has managed to find out her whereabouts,” Cristosal said in a statement, calling the refusal to disclose her location or allow access to lawyers “a blatant violation of due process”. The group said her arrest “raises serious concerns about the increasing risks faced by human rights defenders in El Salvador”. López has publicly criticised the government’s mass incarceration of alleged gang members, many of whom have not been charged. Cristosal, one of the most prominent human rights groups in Latin America, has assisted Salvadoran families caught in Bukele’s security policies, as well as more than 250 Venezuelan immigrants who have been deported to El Salvador under Trump’s administration. Bukele, who has called himself “the world’s coolest dictator” and has cultivated close ties with Trump, said earlier this year that El Salvador isready to houseUS prisoners in a sprawling mega-prison opened last year. In March, Trump used rarely invoked wartime powers to send dozens of Venezuelans to El Salvador without trial, alleging ties to the Tren de Aragua gang – a charge their families and lawyers deny. TheUS Supreme Courton Friday barred the Trump administration from quickly resuming swift deportations of Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. In April, Cristosal reported that police had entered its offices during a news conference to film and photograph journalists and staff members – part of what observers say is a broader campaign of harassment and intimidation against civil society organisations and independent media. López was recognised by the BBC as one of the world’s 100 most inspiring and influential women for her commitment to justice and the rule of law. A joint statement signed by more than a dozen rights organisations, includingAmnesty Internationaland Human Rights Watch, demanded her immediate release. “El Salvador’s state of exception has not only been used to address gang-related violence but also as a tool to silence critical voices,” the statement said. “Authoritarianism has increased in recent years as President Nayib Bukele has undermined institutions and the rule of law, and persecuted civil society organizations and independent journalists,” it added.",

    "title": "After Putin call, Trump says Russia, Ukraine will start ceasefire talks",
    "article_text": "United States President Donald Trump has said, after a more-than-two-hour call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, that Moscow and Kyiv “will immediately start negotiations” toward a ceasefire and an end to their war, now in its fourth bloody year. Putin said that efforts to end the conflict seemed “on the right track” and that Moscow was ready to work with Ukraine on a memorandum about a future peace accord. Putin thanked Trump for supporting the resumption of direct talks between Russia and Ukraine, and said that Trump noted Russia’s support for peace, though the key question was how to move towards peace. “We have agreed with the president of the United States that Russia will propose and is ready to work with the Ukrainian side on a memorandum on a possible future peace accord, defining a number of positions, such as, for example, the principles of settlement, [and] the timing of a possible peace agreement,” Putin told reporters near the Black Sea resort of Sochi. If appropriate agreements are reached, then there could be a ceasefire, Putin said, adding that direct talks between Russia and Ukraine “give reason to believe that we are generally on the right track”. “I would like to note that, on the whole, Russia’s position is clear. The main thing for us is to eliminate the root causes of this crisis,” Putin said. “We just need to determine the most effective ways to move towards peace.” Comments released by Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov early Tuesday, quoted by Russia’s state news agencies, suggested no urgency from Moscow’s side to next steps. “There are no deadlines and there cannot be any. It is clear that everyone wants to do this as quickly as possible, but, of course, the devil is in the details,” Peskov said. For his part, Trump said the call went very well. In a post on Truth Social, he said that the Vatican, “as represented by the Pope, has stated that it would be very interested in hosting the negotiations. Let the process begin!” Later on Monday, Trump said “it would be great” to hold ceasefire talks at the Vatican as it would add extra significance to the proceedings. Describing his phone call with Putin, Trump said he told him: “When are we going to end this, Vladimir?” He added that there could be a time when sanctions are imposed on Russia, without providing more details. Al Jazeera’s Yulia Shapovalova, reporting from Moscow, said the call was “very important” for Putin. “He [Putin] believes that the US – because of its influence – can resolve any problems. Vladimir Putin believes that initially the US was standing behind Ukraine in this conflict, masterminding it,” Shapovalova said. “So, to address the so-called root causes of the conflict, it was important to speak directly with Donald Trump and with the US.” Trump briefed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders on the call. Zelenskyy has insisted that if Putin doesn’t commit to a ceasefire, stronger sanctions on Russia should be imposed. The Ukrainian president said his country is ready to hold negotiations with Russia in Turkiye, Switzerland or the Vatican, renewing Kyiv’s call for a “full and unconditional ceasefire”. “It is not necessary to convince Ukraine, and our representatives are prepared to make real decisions in negotiations,” Zelenskyy said in a statement. “What’s needed is a mirrored readiness from Russia to engage in meaningful talks.” Zelenskyy also called for continued US engagement to resolve the conflict, saying it is crucial the US “does not distance itself” from the talks. Meanwhile, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said European and US leaders have welcomed Pope Leo XIV’s readiness to host Russia-Ukraine talks at the Vatican. Meloni’s office said European leaders, including Zelenskyy, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, spoke to Trump after his call with Putin. “Work is under way to immediately start negotiations between the parties that can lead to a ceasefire as soon as possible and build the conditions for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine,” Meloni’s office said in a statement. “In this regard, the Holy Father’s willingness to host the talks at the Vatican was considered positive. Italy is ready to do its part to facilitate contacts and work for peace,” the statement added. Finnish President Alexander Stubb stressed the importance of US-Europe “coordination”, saying the call between Trump and European leaders lasted for one hour and was “productive”. Trump, who has promised to bring a swift end to Europe’s deadliest war since World War II, has repeatedly called for a ceasefire after years in which Washington joined other Western countries in arming Ukraine. Putin recently rejected an offer by Zelenskyy to meet in person in Turkiye, for talks between the two nations that the Russian leader suggested himself, as an alternative to a 30-day ceasefire urged by Ukraine and its Western allies, including Washington. Thoseinconclusive direct talks– the first in three years, between delegations from Ukraine and Russia in Istanbul on Friday – were brief and only yielded an agreement to swap 1,000 prisoners of war, according to the heads of both delegations, in what would be their biggest such exchange since the war began. A senior Ukrainian official familiar with the talks said Russian negotiators demanded that Kyiv pull its troops out of all its regions claimed by Moscow before they would agree to a ceasefire. That is a red line for Ukraine, and as it stands, Russia does not have full control in those regions. Ukraine’s intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, told Ukrainian television on Saturday that the exchanges could happen as early as this week. While wrapping up his four-day trip to the Middle East, Trump said on Friday that Putin had not gone to Istanbul because Trump himself wasn’t there. “He and I will meet, and I think we’ll solve it or maybe not,” Trump told reporters after boarding Air Force One. “At least we’ll know. And if we don’t solve it, it’ll be very interesting.” European leaders have said they want the US to join them in imposing tough new sanctions on Russia if it continues to refuse a ceasefire. The leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Italy spoke to Trump on Sunday ahead of his call with Putin. Al Jazeera’s John Hendren, reporting from Kyiv, said there has been muted reaction in Ukraine so far. “There’s probably not going to be a lot of celebrations unless the details are much more revealing than what we’ve seen so far,” Hendren said. The calls have taken place a day after Russia launched its largest drone attack on Ukraine since the start of the war. Ukraine’s intelligence service said it also believed Moscow intended to fire an intercontinental ballistic missile on Sunday, though there was no confirmation from Russia that it had done so.",

In Poland, the governing party’s pro-EU candidate and his right-wing nationalist rival are set for a decisive second-round vote in June.

    "title": "Former President Bolsonaro’s coup trial opens in Brazil",
    "article_text": "The trial of formerBrazilian President Jair Bolsonarohas begun, with charges that he plotted a coup d’etat and led a “criminal organisation” to overturn the result of the October 2022 election, in which he was narrowly defeated by current President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. The country’s Supreme Court is hearing testimony from high-ranking military and political figures from Monday over the next two weeks. The 70-year-old far-right leader, a former army captain, who governed Brazil from 2019 to 2022, could face up to 40 years in prison if convicted. Bolsonaro denies the allegations, claiming he is a victim of “political persecution”. More than 80 witnesses are set to testify via videoconference, including Generals Marco Antonio Freire Gomes and Carlos de Almeida Baptista Junior, who served as commanders of the army and air force under Bolsonaro. In previous statements to federal police, both men said Bolsonaro had “raised the hypothetical possibility” of using legal means to annul the 2022 election and justify a military intervention. According to prosecutors, the alleged plot included plans to declare a state of emergency, hold new elections and assassinate President Lula. A 900-page federal police report details the scheme, which prosecutors say ultimately collapsed due to a lack of support within the military. The charges also encompass theJanuary 8, 2023 riots in Brasília, when thousands of Bolsonaro supporters stormed Congress, the Supreme Court, and the presidential palace one week after Lula’s inauguration. Though Bolsonaro, a close ally of United States President Donald Trump when they were both in power, was in the US at the time, prosecutors argue he backed the violence, calling it the “last hope” of those seeking to overturn the election. Seven of Bolsonaro’s former aides are being tried alongside him, including four former ministers, a former navy commander, and the head of Brazil’s intelligence services during his presidency. This marks the first time a Brazilian president has faced coup charges since the end of the military dictatorship in 1985. Bolsonaro, who has often expressed admiration for that era, is already banned from holding public office until 2030 after making claims about Brazil’s electronic voting system. Despite the ban, Bolsonaro has indicated a desire to return to politics. But speaking to UOL last week, he likened the charges to a “telenovela scenario” and warned that a conviction would be a “death penalty, political and physical”. Bolsonaro was heavily criticised when he was Brazil’s leader during the COVID-19 pandemic and when his policies and spread of misinformation contributed to the nation having the highest overall death toll in Latin America, and the second highest in the world after the US, from the coronavirus. Earlier this month, he was recentlydischarged from hospitalafter undergoing major abdominal surgery, the latest in a series of procedures stemming from a stabbing attack in 2018.",

    "title": "Measure targeting pro-Palestine NGOs disappears from US tax bill",
    "article_text": "Washington, DC –A measure known as the “nonprofit killer” has been removed from an enormous tax bill being advanced in the United States Congress, according to the bill posted online by the House of Representatives. The provision, which no longer appeared on thePresident Donald Trump-backed“One Big, Beautiful Bill” on Monday, would have given the executive branch the authority to strip the tax-exempt status of nonprofits that it deems supportive of “terrorism”. Advocates have warned that the legislative effort – whichfailed to passas a stand-alone bill last year – could be abused to crack down on groups that the administration does not agree with, particularly nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) that support Palestinian rights. Israel has given little indication that it is relenting after more than 19 months into its war on Gaza. The past week has seen an intensification of violence across the besieged Palestinian territory, which has killed hundreds of people. The reason for the disappearance of the NGO provision remains unclear, and experts warned it may yet reappear in the bill before the final vote in the House, expected later in the week. The office of Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson did not immediately respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment. With a razor-thin majority in the House, Republicans need every vote to pass the tax bill, which Trump has put at the top of his agenda in Congress. Kia Hamadanchy, senior policy counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union, said the section may have been removed to avoid additional controversy for the must-pass bill, especially because the Senate parliamentarian, a nonpartisan office that oversees procedures, may have rejected it for violating the rules. “It’s possible that this is a hiccup that they didn’t want, given that it wasn’t even likely to go through,” Hamadanchy told Al Jazeera. “I can’t tell you that is the reason for sure. What I can tell you is that we continue to be very vigilant in case it comes back, either later this week or in the future.” For weeks, Trump has been calling on Congress to pass the bill, which extends his 2017 tax cuts, a key component of hiseconomic plans. But the proposal has faced some opposition from conservative budget hawks, who have argued it does not cut spending enough and would add to the nation’s $36.2 trillion debt. So Republicans can ill-afford unnecessary issues that could derail thepassage of the legislation. Rights groups have been rallying against the “nonprofit killer”, saying it violates free speech and the right to due process. The proposal would have granted the secretary of state power to unilaterally declare an NGO “terrorist supporting” and make it ineligible for tax exemptions. It also said the government would not have to reveal the reason behind the designation if “disclosure of such description would be inconsistent with national security or law enforcement interests”. Under the current rules, organisations certified to be nonprofits by the government get breaks on their federal income taxes. The status also makes donations to such groups tax deductible for donors. While the withdrawn measure would have allowed a targeted NGO to challenge the secretary of state’s decision in court, losing the tax exempt status, even if temporarily, could have proven costly for nonprofits, especially smaller organisations. Hamadanchy said being accused of supporting terrorism could also have prompted banks to close down the accounts of the groups. “And then you have legal costs fighting off the designation because even if you might win in court, it’s going to take time to get there, and it’s going to cause a lot of damage to your organisation through that process,” he said. “And that’s sort of the point because they want to chill speech.” Hamadanchy noted that existing laws already make material support for a designated “terrorist” group a criminal offence with severe penalties. The legislative push coincided with the Trump administration’s crackdown on Palestinian rights supporters, especially on college campuses. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has revoked the student visas of several Palestine advocates – who have not been charged with a criminal offence –over allegationsof “support for terrorism”. Some advocacy groups have portrayed the “nonprofit killer” as part of a broader push to muzzle voices critical of Israel. “This bill is designed to silence dissent, especially from Muslim, Palestinian and civil rights organizations that speak out against injustice and genocide,” theCouncil on American Islamic Relationssaid in a statement last week. “It threatens every nonprofit that engages in advocacy, educates the public, or challenges government policy.” The apparent setback for the nonprofit provision came nearly two weeks after House leaders cancelled a vote on a bill to restrict boycotts of Israelafter a backlashfrom right-wing legislators who voiced opposition to the measure on free speech grounds. Lara Friedman, president of the Foundation for Middle East Peace, said it would be “interesting” to see how Republican leaders would deal with staunchly pro-Israel measures like the “nonprofit killer” going forward. “They on the one hand likely see this as a fun opportunity to embarrass Democrats – whose opposition will be framed as anti-Israel or enabling terror and antisemitism – and on the other hand they have to worry about principled opposition from within their own ranks,” Friedman told Al Jazeera in a statement.",

    "title": "Regeneron buys 23andMe for $256m after bankruptcy",
    "article_text": "Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has bought the genetic testing company 23andMe, a company once valued at $6bn, for $256mthrough a bankruptcy auction. Regeneron said in a statement on Monday that it aims to bolster its capabilities in genomics-driven drug discovery by using customer DNA profiles, collected via its popular direct-to-consumer saliva testing kits. It added it would prioritise the ethical use of customers’ DNA data. However, the transaction has put the spotlight back on data privacy issues, especially in light of 23andMe’s recent challenges. Founded in 2006, 23andMe has collected the genetic information of roughly 15 million people. The genomics firm, once a trailblazer in ancestry DNA testing, has faced dwindling demand for its core services and reputational damage from a 2023 data breach that exposed sensitive genetic and personal information of millions of users. The hack and subsequent bankruptcy filing have drawn scrutiny from lawmakers who warned that millions of customers’ genetic data could be sold to unscrupulous buyers. After the company’s bankruptcy filing in March, several congressional committees and federal agencies, including the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and  the Federal Trade Commission, penned letters voicing concerns  that the company’s data could end up in the hands of malicious parties. The Subcommittee on Oversight and Accountability in the House of Representatives launched an investigation into the matter. Acknowledging the heightened scrutiny, Regeneron said it will uphold 23andMe’s existing privacy policies and comply with all applicable data protection laws. The drugmaker also committed to working transparently with a court-appointed independent overseer who will assess the implications of the deal for consumer privacy and is expected to deliver a report to the court by June 10. The court is scheduled to consider approval of the transaction on June 17. Investments in genomics “make good strategic sense” for Regeneron but might take a decade or more to see a return, Bernstein analyst William Pickering told the news agency Reuters. “Given Regeneron’s track record, we also believe 23andMe customers are in good hands from a privacy perspective,” Pickering added. As part of the agreement, Regeneron will acquire all units of 23andMe except the company’s on-demand telehealth service Lemonaid Health, which is being shuttered. After the transaction, expected to be completed in the third quarter, 23andMe will operate as a wholly owned unit of Regeneron. Despite the news of the purchase, Regeneron’s stock was down 0.6 percent from the market open on Wall Street as of 12pm in New York (16:00 GMT) although it had gone up 2.86 percent over the previous five days.",

    "article_text": "Lithuaniahas initiated legal proceedings against Belarus at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), accusing its neighbour of orchestrating a refugee and migrant crisis by facilitating the smuggling of people across their border. “The Belarusian regime must be held legally accountable for orchestrating the wave of illegal migration and the resulting human rights violations,” Lithuanian Justice Minister Rimantas Mockus said in a statement on Monday. “We are taking this case to the International Court of Justice to send a clear message: no state can use vulnerable people as political pawns without facing consequences under international law.” The case, submitted to the ICJ in The Hague, centres on alleged violations by Belarus of the United Nations Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air. Lithuania’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said attempts to resolve the issue through bilateral talks failed and it has evidence showing direct involvement by the Belarusian state in organising refugee and migrant flows, including a surge in flights from the Middle East operated by Belarusian state-owned airlines. After landing in Belarus, many of the passengers were escorted to the Lithuanian border by Belarusian security forces and forced to cross illegally, Lithuanian officials said. Lithuania also accused Belarus of refusing to cooperate with its border services in preventing irregular crossings and said it is seeking compensation through the ICJ for alleged damages caused, including costs related to border reinforcement. Tensions between the two countries have simmered since 2021 when thousands of people – mostly from the Middle East and Africa – began arriving at the borders of Lithuania, Poland and Latvia from Belarus. Belarus had previously deported Middle Eastern refugees and migrants with more than400 Iraqis repatriated to Baghdadon a charter flight from Minsk in November 2021. That same year, a Human Rights Watch report accused Belarus of manufacturing the crisis, finding that “accounts of violence, inhuman and degrading treatment and coercion by Belarusian border guards were commonplace”. European Union officials have also accused Minsk of “weaponising” migration in an effort to destabilise the bloc. The claims are strongly denied by Belarus. In December, the EU approved emergency measures allowing member states bordering Belarus and Russia to temporarily suspend asylum rights in cases in which migration is being manipulated for political ends.",

    "title": "Project Esther and the weaponisation of Zionism",
    "article_text": "On October 7, 2024 – exactly one year into theUnited States-backed Israeli genocidein the Gaza Strip that has now killed more than 53,000 Palestinians – the Washington-based Heritage Foundation unleashed a policy paper titled Project Esther: A National Strategy to Combat Antisemitism. The conservative think tank is the same force behindProject 2025, a blueprint for consolidating executive power in the US and forging the best-ever right-wing dystopia. The “national strategy” proposed byProject Esther– which is named for the biblical queen credited with saving the Jews from extermination in ancient Persia – basically consists of criminalising opposition to Israel’s current genocide and exterminating freedoms of speech and thought along with a whole lot of other rights. The first “key takeaway” listed in the report is that “America’s virulently anti-Israel, anti-Zionist, and anti-American ‘pro-Palestinian movement’ is part of a global Hamas Support Network (HSN)”. Never mind that, in reality, there is no such thing as a “global Hamas Support Network” – just as there is no such thing as the HSN’s alleged “affiliated Hamas Support Organizations (HSOs)” that the Heritage Foundation has also taken the liberty of inventing. Among these alleged HSOs are prominent American Jewish organisations such as Jewish Voice for Peace. The second “key takeaway” of the report is that the so-called HSN is “supported by activists and funders dedicated to destroying capitalism and democracy” – a curious choice of terms, no doubt, from a think tank that is doing its best to eradicate what remains of US democracy as we speak. The phrase “capitalism and democracy” appears no fewer than five times in the report – although it’s not quite clear what Hamas has to do with capitalism aside from governing a Palestinian territory that has for more than 19 months been on the receiving end of billions upon billions of dollars’ worth of US-funded military destruction. From the perspective of the arms industry, at least, genocide is capitalism at its best. And as per the genocidal logic of Project Esther, protesting the mass slaughter of Palestinians is fundamentally anti-Semitic – hence the need to pursue the prescribed national strategy of “extirpating the influence of the HSN from our society”. The October publication of the Heritage Foundation report occurred on the watch of President Joe Biden’s administration, which the think tank diagnosed as “decidedly anti-Israel” despite itscomplete and uttercomplicity in the genocide in Gaza. The report included many suggestions on how to “combat the scourge of antisemitism in the United States … when a willing Administration occupies the White House”. Fast forward seven months, and a recent New York Timesanalysisindicates that, since US President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January, “the White House and other Republicans have called for actions that appear to mirror more than half of Project Esther’s proposals”. These range from threats to withhold gargantuan sums of federal funding for US universities that refuse to silence resistance to systematic slaughter toefforts to deport legal US residentsfor the crime of expressing solidarity with Palestinians. In addition to allegedly infiltrating US academia and disseminating “anti-Zionist narratives across universities, high schools, and elementary schools, often under the umbrella or within the rubric of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and similar Marxist ideology”, Project Esther’s authors contend that “the HSN and HSOs have mastered the use of America’s liberal media environment [and] are quick to gain attention for any and every demonstration, no matter how large or small, from every network across the country”. And that’s not all: “The HSN and HSOs have made prolific and unchecked use of social media platforms, such as TikTok, across the entire digital ecosystem to spout antisemitic propaganda.” To all of these ends, the policy paper offers a whole host of recommendations for how to stamp out the domestic pro-Palestine movement as well as humane and ethical attitudes in general: from purging “HSO-supporting faculty and staff” from educational institutions to making “potential demonstrators fear affiliation with HSOs” to banning “antisemitic content” from social media – which in Heritage Foundation jargon of course means anti-genocidal content. And yet in spite of all of Project Esther’s ruckus over the ostensibly existential anti-Semitic threat posed by the HSN, it turns out that “no major Jewish organizations appear to have participated in drafting the plan, or publicly endorsed it since its release”, according to a Decemberarticlein the Forward. A news outlet catering to American Jews, the Forward reported that the Heritage Foundation had “struggled to attract Jewish supporters for its antisemitism plan, which appears to have been assembled by several evangelical Christian groups”, and that Project Esther “focuses exclusively on left-wing critics of Israel, ignoring the antisemitism problems from white supremacists and other far-right groups”. Meanwhile, in anopen letterpublished this month, influential American Jewish leaders warned that a “range of actors” in the US are currently “using a purported concern about Jewish safety as a cudgel to weaken higher education, due process, checks and balances, freedom of speech and the press”. Now, if the Trump administration seems to be taking Project Esther and running with it, it is more out of concern for propagating a white Christian nationalist agenda that utilises Zionism and anti-Semitism charges to its own extremist ends. And this, unfortunately, is just the beginning of a far more elaborate project.

    "title": "What is Israel’s new major ground offensive, Operation Gideon’s Chariots?",
    "article_text": "Israel’s military has launched anintense ground offensivein thebesieged Gaza Strip. The offensive comes on the back of a more than two-month total blockade on Gaza after Israel decided to unilaterally end a ceasefire with Hamas in March. Israel has come under increasing international pressure, including from its staunch allies in the United States government, to agree to a ceasefire and allow aid into Gaza. Meanwhile,Hamas and Israeli negotiators are in Dohafor new indirect talks. Here’s everything you need to know about Israel’s latest ground assault: Operation Gideon’s Chariots is a major ground offensive launched by Israel on the Gaza Strip that comes after air attacks killed hundreds of Palestinians in recent days and further debilitated Gaza’s healthcare network. With the backing of Israel’s lethal air force, the operation is targeting both southern and northern Gaza. The assault began as the second day of ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas ended on Saturday in Doha. Israel tends to intensify operations and attacks duringsuch negotiations. It said this latest offensive is exerting “tremendous pressure” on Hamas. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu launched this latest assault as US President Donald Trump concluded hisMiddle East tourof Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates but did not stop in Israel. The Israeli military said the offensive was launched to expand “operational control” in the Gaza Strip. Israel says its campaign also aims to free the remaining captives held in Gaza and defeat Hamas. However, Netanyahu has been repeatedly criticised by segments of Israeli society, including captives’ families, for failing to prioritise their return and has also rejected Hamas’s offers to end the war and free the captives. A week before the start of the operation, quotes were leaked of Netanyahu speaking about the forced displacement of Palestinians in Gaza outside the Gaza Strip. “We are destroying more and more homes. They have nowhere to return to,” Netanyahu said in closed-door testimony made to the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee. “The only inevitable outcome will be the desire of Gazans to emigrate outside of the Gaza Strip.” Since Sunday, the day Israel confirmed the operation, at least 144 people have been killed in a relentless wave of strikes. At least 42 people died in the heavily bombarded northern part of the Strip, according to medical sources. Five of those killed were journalists. In southern Gaza, at least 36 people were killed and more than 100 wounded in Israeli air strikes on a tent encampment of displaced Palestinians in the al-Mawasi area of Khan Younis governorate, according to medical sources. But the lead-up to the operation also included heavy attacks. In the past week, Israel has attacked more than 670 places in Gaza and claimed all were “Hamas targets” located both above and beneath the ground. Israel has been accused of disproportionately targeting civilians in Gaza, including displaced families. At least370 Palestinianswere killed over five days. Since the start of the war in October 2023, at least 53,339 Palestinians have been killed and 121,034 wounded, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health. The severity of the recentattacks has many Palestinians expressing fears on social media that their latest posts may be their last. OnMonday, the Israeli military issued forced evacuation orders for Khan Younis, Gaza’s second-largest city, warning of an “unprecedented attack”. Israel said it is targeting Hamas targets, a claim that has been increasingly challenged by human rights groups and experts as its more than 19-month war on Gaza continues. Among the sites hit are hospitals, a recurring target for the Israeli military in Gaza. Muhammad Zaqout, the director general of hospitals in Gaza, described the tactic as part of “Israel’s systematic measures against hospitals”. On Sunday, the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza was renderednonoperationalafter it was besieged by Israeli forces. Medical professionals said it could lead to the deaths of thousands of sick and wounded people. The situation was described as “catastrophic” by Marwan al-Sultan, the director of the facility, who also called on international organisations to push for the safety of medical teams. Al-Awda Hospital in northern Gaza’s Jabalia and European Gaza Hospital in southern Gaza have also been bombed. In recent days, Israel said it has killed Hamas’s leader in the Gaza Strip, Mohammad Sinwar, the brother and successor of the lateYahya Sinwar. It also reportedly killed another Sinwar brother, Zakaria Sinwar, a university lecturer, and three of his children in an air strike on central Gaza. On Sunday, Hamas released a statement calling the attacks on displaced Palestinians in Khan Younis a “brutal crime” and a flagrant violation of international laws and norms. The group also placed blame on the US for backing Israel. “By granting the terrorist occupation government political and military cover, the United States administration bears direct responsibility for this insane escalation in the targeting of innocent civilians in the Gaza Strip, including children, women, and the elderly,” Hamas said. The entire Strip is at risk offamine. Basic humanitarian supplies, including food, fuel, medical aid and vaccines for children, have been blocked by Israel from entering the Strip. More than 90 percent of the population has been displaced since the war began on October 7, 2023. Many Palestinians have been displaced multiple times with some people being forced to relocate 10 times or more. Israel has refused the entry of any aid sinceMarch 2. International actors and agencies have been pressing hard for Israel to resume the distribution of aid to Gaza to little effect. “Two months into the latest blockade,two million people are starving, while 116,000 tonnes of food is blocked at the border just minutes away,” said World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus speaking at the opening of the annual World Health Assembly. One in five Palestinians in Gaza is currently facing starvation, while9,000 children, who are most vulnerable to Israel’s continued food blockade, have been hospitalised for acute malnutrition since the start of the year, according to the United Nations. Late on Sunday, Netanyahu announced that some food would be allowed into the Gaza Strip in a much needed reprieve for the local population. “Israel will allow a basic amount of food for the population to ensure that a hunger crisis does not develop in the Gaza Strip,” Netanyahu’soffice saidin a statement. Netanyahu said on Monday that the move was motivated by pressure from Israel’s allies. It is unclear when the border will open to allow in aid. The latest round of talks started on Saturday, and by the end of Sunday, there had been little progress. Talks are set to continue this week. Israel and Hamas both claimed the talks began without conditions. “The Hamas delegation outlined the position of the group and the necessity to end the war, swap prisoners, the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and allow humanitarian aid and all the needs of the people of Gaza back into the Strip,” Taher al-Nono, the media adviser for Hamas’s leadership, told the Reuters news agency. The criticism of Israel is increasing. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was “alarmed” by Israel’s expanded offensive in Gaza and called for an immediate ceasefire. Germany, one of Israel’s foremost backers, expressed deep concern over the offensive. Its Federal Foreign Office said in a statement: “A large-scale military offensive also entails the risk that the catastrophic humanitarian situation for the population in Gaza and the situation of the remaining hostages will continue to deteriorate and that the prospect of an urgently needed long-term ceasefire fades.” After the offensive was confirmed, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot called for the “immediate, massive and unhampered” resumption of aid into Gaza. Even before the offensive, international pressure on Israel was growing. Seven European nations urged Israel on Friday to “reverse its current policy” on Gaza. The leaders of Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, Slovenia, Spain and Norway released a joint statement on what they called a “man-made humanitarian catastrophe that is taking place before our eyes in Gaza”. Tom Fletcher, the UN’s humanitarian chief, has called for decisive action to prevent genocide in Gaza. He criticised the US-Israeli joint plan to replace international aid mechanisms in Gaza as a “waste of time”. More than 160,000 pallets of aid are “ready to move” at the border, he said, but are being blocked by Israel. Volker Turk, the UN’s human rights chief, said on Friday that Israel’s bombing campaign is intended to bring about a “permanent demographic shift in Gaza” and is in “defiance of international law”.",

    "title": "Sudan’s army leader al-Burhan appoints former UN official as prime minister",
    "article_text": "Sudan’s army chief and de facto head of state,Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, has appointed former United Nations official Kamil Idris as prime minister as part of changes to his sovereign council as the nation’s civil war grinds on into its third year. Tens of thousands of people have been killed, critical infrastructure has been destroyed and more than 12 million people have been displaced as a result of the war, which shows no signs of stopping as vying leaders seek to consolidate their power. “The chairman of the sovereignty council issued a constitutional decree appointing Kamil El-Tayeb Idris Abdelhafiz as prime minister,” a statement from Sudan’s ruling Transitional Sovereignty Council read on Monday. Idris, a career diplomat, spent decades at the UN’s World Intellectual Property Organisation and was its director general from 1997 to 2008. He also held various roles in Sudan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and used to serve in the country’s permanent mission to the UN. Idris, whose higher education was in international law and international affairs, also ran as an independent candidate in Sudan’s presidential election in 2010 against longtime military ruler Omar al-Bashir, who was laterousted in a 2019 coup. The new prime minister replaces veteran diplomat Dafallah al-Haj Ali, who was appointed by al-Burhan less than a month ago as acting premier. On Monday, al-Burhan also added two women to the council. The military leader reappointed Salma Abdel Jabbar Almubarak and named Nowara Abo Mohamed Mohamed Tahir to the governing body. The al-Burhan-led military and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary headed byMohamed Hamdan Dagalo, have been at war for more than two years after the two generals failed to agree on a plan to integrate their forces. As al-Burhan tried to form an army-led government, Dagalo also announced theformation of a rival administrationlast month, shortly after signing a charter with allies in Kenya’s Nairobi. The army, which holds areas in the central, eastern and northern parts of Sudan, has managed to claim some military victories in recent months, includingtaking control of the capital, Khartoum. The RSF, which holds most of the western region of Darfur and some areas in the south with its allied militias, has beenstriking Port Sudanrepeatedly this month to devastating effect. Meanwhile, a worsening humanitarian crisis continues to engulf Sudan. International organisations and some countries have warned of the risks of further escalating the conflict, including in cities like el-Fasher in Darfur that have served as humanitarian aid hubs.",

    "title": "UK, EU reach landmark deal: All you need to know",
    "article_text": "The United Kingdom and the European Union cut a breakthroughdealon Monday pertaining to fisheries, trade and security. The deal was finalised hours before a high-level UK-EU summit in London, which seeks to reset Britain’s post-Brexit relationship with Europe. On Monday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer hosted the first UK-EU summit in London sinceBrexit. Senior EU officials, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, attended the summit. Brexit is short for “British exit”, and it refers to the UK withdrawing from the then 28-nation trade bloc. In June 2016, a referendum took place where voters were asked whether the UK should leave the EU, and 52 percent of voters preferred the withdrawal. The official exit took place in January 2020. The same year, a Brexit deal with the EU was struck by the Conservative Party led by then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The EU is the UK’s largest trading partner. Since Brexit, the UK has seen a 21 percent drop in exports to the EU and a 7 percent drop in imports from the member countries, according to a statement from Starmer’s office on Monday. The deal covers agreements in several sectors, including: Before Brexit, EU nations could fish in British waters, just as UK vessels could hunt for fish in the waters of other European nations. Under a common EU policy, however, there were quotas in place on how much fish could be caught in the waters of any nation to prevent overfishing. Under the 2020 post-Brexit deal, the EU agreed to reduce its fishing quota in UK waters by 25 percent gradually by 2026. In 2026, Britain could choose to completely ban EU ships from fishing in its waters. The deal announced on Monday keeps the 25 percent quota cut, but extends access for EU boats to British waters until 2038. Starmer’s office also announced a 360-million-pound (about $481m) fund to invest in coastal communities. This money will go “towards new technology and equipment to modernise the fleet, training to help upskill the workforce, and funding to help revitalise coastal communities, support tourism and boost seafood exports”, according to Starmer’s office. The EU has agreed to a deal which simplifies checks for sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) goods. SPS goods include agricultural products, food and animals. This means some routine border checks on plant and animal products will be dropped on both sides. In a post on X, Starmer said the EU and the UK will work closely on security matters by sharing intelligence. This includes sharing facial recognition data. Britons on holiday will be able to use e-gates – the automated entry and exit gates – at more European airports to avoid long queues at immigration counters. The UK and the EU will link their carbon markets – trading systems in which carbon credits are sold and bought – to avoid carbon taxes. “Combined, the SPS and Emissions Trading Systems linking measures alone are set to add nearly £9 billion [$12bn] to the UK economy by 2040, in a huge boost for growth,” the statement from 10 Downing Street said on Monday. The EU and the UK are also agreeing to work together on a youth mobility scheme, which would allow young people, below the age of 30, from the UK and the EU to live and work in each other’s territory for a limited period. Such a scheme would be “capped and time-limited”, according to Starmer’s office. However, details of this programme have not been unveiled yet. Starmer posted a 10-pointthreadon his X account on Monday, underlining multiple ways the “deal with the EU will benefit Britain”. He claimed the deal will lower food prices by easing agricultural trade with the EU; bring down energy bills; strengthen border security; reduce waiting times at airports; ensure a “more secure Britain” with more jobs in the defence industry; save UK businesses from carbon taxes; save the UK steel industry; and combat terrorism and organised crime due to intelligence sharing. “We rolled up our sleeves to deliver what the last government couldn’t,” wrote Starmer. Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch voiced concerns about the deal in an X post, specifically hitting out at the extended period for which EU fishing ships will have access to British waters. “We’re becoming a rule-taker from Brussels once again. And with no details on any cap or time limits on Youth Mobility, fears of free movement returning will only increase. This is very concerning.” 12 years access to British waters is three times longer than the govt wanted. We’re becoming a rule-taker from Brussels once again. And with no details on any cap or time limits on Youth Mobility, fears of free movement returning will only increase. This is very concerning.https://t.co/QzocW3QOwU — Kemi Badenoch (@KemiBadenoch)May 19, 2025 Nigel Farage, leader of the far-right Reform UK party, posted on X about the deal, saying: “If true that will be the end of the fishing industry.” If true that will be the end of the fishing industry.https://t.co/jUIH7ZlCpj — Nigel Farage MP (@Nigel_Farage)May 19, 2025 The Scottish Fishermen’s Federation (SFF) has deemed the deal “a horror show for Scottish fishermen”, according to a statement by Elspeth Macdonald, chief executive of the SFF. Macdonald said the new deal is “far worse than Boris Johnson’s botched Brexit agreement”, adding, “This highlights the total indifference of the British political establishment to the interests of our fishing sector.” “Any attempt by either the UK or EU to portray the new deal as a continuation of existing arrangements would be a lie,” said the statement, published on the SFF website. Both the Conservative Party and Reform UK have previously demanded more control for the UK over its waters. However, Ed Davey, the leader of theLiberal Democrats party, called out Conservative leaders criticising the deal. “Social media this morning is a zombie apocalypse of dinosaur Tory politicians and right wing hangers-on hankering after the nasty Brexit wars of the last decade. Our country has moved on!” Social media this morning is a zombie apocalypse of dinosaur Tory politicians and right wing hangers-on hankering after the nasty Brexit wars of the last decade.

    "title": "Gaza’s Khan Younis latest focus of Israeli forced displacement, bombing",
    "article_text": "Israel’s military has issued another forced displacement order to residents of Gaza’s southern city of Khan Younis, threatening an “unprecedented” assault after launching a wave of deadly strikes on the area and pressing a punishing new ground offensive. The displacement order, posted on X by the military’s Arabic-language spokesman Avichay Adraee on Monday, also applies to the nearby areas of Bani Suhaila and Abasan. It calls on Palestinians to move west towards al-Mawasi. “From this moment, Khan Younis governorate will be considered a dangerous combat zone,” the post read. It comes a day after Israel’s military issued a separate displacement order for areas of central Gaza, including the town of al-Qarara, as its expanded offensive continues. The new order also comes as Israeli forces continue to pound the blockaded enclave, where a famine is looming. There have been at least 30 air strikes in the Khan Younis area Monday as Israel hammered the vastly destroyed territory from north to south, killing at least 84 people since dawn, medical sources tell Al Jazeera. Previous forced evacuation orders throughout Israel’s 19-month war have displaced the majority of Gaza’s population multiple times. Many Palestinians have been bombarded again after fleeing to Israeli-designated “safe zones”, including al-Mawasi. Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, said Monday’s displacement order “signals a potential full-scale attack” in Khan Younis. “Many families are in a state of chaos. They are trying to get whatever they can from their properties and move to al-Mawasi, where the Israeli military has instructed them to go to,” Abu Azzoum said, adding that an attack targeting al-Mawasi earlier in the day had killed two people. “The repeated issuance of evacuation orders has shattered any sense of safety for Palestinians,” Abu Azzoum said. Israeli forces carried out a massive operation earlier in the war that left much of Khan Younis in ruins. Al-Mawasi, where tens of thousands of people have fled, has also been repeatedly targeted by deadly Israeli strikes. Under the newly launched air and ground offensive, Israel said it plans to displace hundreds of thousands of Palestinians and secure limited aid distribution inside the territory – something that has been widely criticised by aid groups and the United Nations. In a video message on Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the military is to “take control of the entire territory of the Gaza Strip”. He said a plan to let“minimal”aid into Gaza is aimed at alleviating pressure from allies, who, he said, cannot tolerate “images of … mass hunger”. It remains unclear when the aid will be allowed to enter the Palestinian territory, where two million Palestinians are “starving”, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned. Israel has kept Gaza under a total blockade since early March, pushing the population there into famine as the healthcare system remains under Israeli attack and is quickly crumbling as its access to medical equipment, supplies and fuel has been cut off. Meanwhile, the al-Nasser Salah al-Din Brigades, the military wing of the Popular Resistance Committees, a Palestinian group in Gaza, has confirmed that one of its commanders, Ahmed Sarhan, was killed in Khan Younis. Sarhan was killed in an undercover operation backed by Israeli drones and jets early on Monday. The group said Israeli special forces tried to capture the commander, but he was killed in a shootout after he fought back.",

    "title": "Moscow outlaws Amnesty International for ‘Russophobia’ amid Ukraine war",
    "article_text": "Russian authorities have designated Amnesty International as an “undesirable” organisation, alleging that the rights group propagates pro-war content backed by the Western allies of Ukraine, in the latest crackdown on Kremlin critics. The Russian Prosecutor General’s Office said in a statement on Monday that Amnesty’s London office has acted as a “centre for the preparation of global Russophobic projects paid for by accomplices of the Kyiv regime”, according to state-run media. It claimed that since the start of the war in February 2022, Amnesty has been “doing everything possible to intensify the military confrontation in the region”, including by “insisting on the political and economic isolation of our country”. The office also emphasised that members of the international rights group “support extremist organisations and finance the activities of foreign agents”. Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General, said the decision taken by Moscow is part of its “broader effort to silence dissent”. “We will continue to work relentlessly to ensure that all those who are responsible for committing grave human rights violations, whether in Russia, Ukraine, or elsewhere, face justice … Put simply, no authoritarian assault will silence our fight for justice. Amnesty will never give up or back down in its fight for upholding human rights in Russia and beyond”, she added. The designation means the international human rights groupmust stop any work in Russia, and those accused of cooperating with or supporting it will be exposed to criminal prosecution. This could even include anyone who shares Amnesty International’s reports on social media. Russia currently recognises 223 entities as “undesirable” organisations, including some prominent independent, as well as Western-backed news outlets and rights groups. Some of those include Transparency International,Latvia-based outlet Meduza, and US-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). Amnesty International was established in 1961 to document and report human rights violations around the globe and campaign for the release of those deemed unjustly imprisoned. The organisation won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977, having been recognised “for worldwide respect for human rights” and efforts to combat torture, advocate for prisoners of conscience, and promote global adherence to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In addition to covering human rights violations during the Ukraine war, the group has documented massacres in the Gaza Strip andIsraeli apartheid, as well as atrocities in Sudan and many other countries. Moscow has intensified its crackdown on human rights groups and civil society organisations as relations with the West plummeted over the Ukraine war and the expansion of NATO. This has included expanding the “undesirable” and “foreign agent” designations to shut down opposing voices, as well as the suppression of some minority groups’ rights. The move on Monday came as US President Donald Trump was due tohold a phonecall with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy amid efforts to end the fighting. The diplomatic efforts followinconclusive direct talks, the first in three years, between delegations from Ukraine and Russia in Turkiye’s Istanbul on Friday. The brief talks yielded only an agreement to swap 1,000 prisoners of war, according to the heads of both delegations, in what would be their biggest such exchange since the war began. A senior Ukrainian official familiar with the talks said Russian negotiators demanded Kyiv pull its troops out of all its regions claimed by Moscow before they would agree to a ceasefire. That is a red line for Ukraine, and as it stands, Russia does not have full control in those regions.",

    "title": "Gary Lineker leaves BBC amid anti-Semitism row, pro-Palestinian comments",
    "article_text": "Gary Lineker, a former England captain and the face of football on British television for more than two decades, will leave the BBC, the public broadcaster said in a statement on Monday. Lineker, 64, had been due to cover the 2026 FIFA World Cup for the BBC, but his early departure comes after he apologised last week for sharing a social media post about Zionism which featured a picture of a rat, historically used as an anti-Semitic insult. Lineker said that he deleted the posts after learning of the offensive references. According to multiple British media reports, the high-profile host is “bowing out by mutual agreement”. He rose to become the BBC’s highest-paid star after presenting its Match of the Day (MOTD) highlights show for 25 years. The BBC announced last November that he would step down from MOTD this year, but carry on working for it until 2026. “Gary has acknowledged the mistake he made. Accordingly, we have agreed he will step back from further presenting after this season,” BBC director general Tim Davie said in a statement. Lineker repeated his apology on Monday, saying he would never consciously repost anything anti-Semitic. “I recognise the error and upset that I caused, and reiterate how sorry I am,” he said. “Stepping back now feels like the responsible course of action.” In recent years, Lineker’s desire to put forward his political views on social media has caused headaches for the BBC, which has strict rules on impartiality. He was temporarily taken off air in 2023 after he criticised the previous government’s immigration policy on social media. In 2018, he opposed Brexit and called for a second referendum. But it was Lineker’s support for the Palestinians affected by the war on Gaza that most recently brought him into conflict with the BBC. Lineker had already caused friction at the public broadcaster when he recently said Israel was to blame for the origins of the Gaza conflict, because it turned the occupied territory into an “outdoor prison”. Speaking on May 9 in an interview with The Telegraph at the Football Business Awards, just days before he was accused of the anti-Semitic social post on X, Lineker expressed that his issues are with the Israeli government rather than Jewish people. “Obviously, October 7 was awful, but it’s very important to know your history and to study the massacres that happened prior to this, many of them against the Palestinian people,” he said in the interview with The Telegraph, which was published last Thursday, on May 15. “Yes, Israelis have a right to defend themselves. But it appears that Palestinians don’t – and that is where it’s wrong. Palestinians are caged in this outdoor prison in Gaza, and now it’s an outdoor prison that they’re bombing,” Lineker added. In the same interview, the TV host also disputed whether Israel could justifiably argue that it was still acting in self-defence. “I understand that they needed to avenge, but I don’t think they’ve helped their own hostage situation at all,” Lineker said. “People say it’s a complex issue, but I don’t think it is. It’s inevitable that the Israeli occupation was going to cause massive problems, and I just feel for the Palestinians.” The former striker played for England for eight years until 1992 and had been a top scorer for Leicester City, Everton and Tottenham Hotspur in the 1980s and early 1990s. He is also the co-founder of a podcasting production business, Goalhanger, which makes series such as the podcasts The Rest Is History and The Rest Is Football. Lineker will leave his role at the BBC on Sunday after his final episode of Match of the Day.",

    "title": "Chechnya’s Kadyrov wanted to resign. Or did he?",
    "article_text": "The health of Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, who earlier this month sought to resign, is deteriorating rapidly, sources and observers have told Al Jazeera. But Russian President Vladimir Putin does not want Kadyrov to be succeeded by his third son, they say. Earlier this month, 48-year-old Kadyrov, who has long dubbed himself Putin’s “foot soldier”, said he wanted to quit. “Another [Chechen leader] will have his own initiative, his own vision. I hope my request will be supported,” Kadyrov told a pro-Kremlin publication, Chechnya Today, before his May 7 meeting with Putin. During the meeting in Putin’s office, Kadyrov boasted of 55,000 Chechen servicemen fighting in Ukraine and read a laundry list of economic achievements under his rule in Chechnya, a region home to 1.5 million people. Kadyrov, known as a boxing and weightlifting aficionado,readhis words aloud from cards with extra-large print. Neither mentioned the resignation. Kadyrov clarified the issue a day later and habitually glorified Putin. “Whatever I say, no matter how hard I ask, the decision is only made by one person – our Supreme Commander,” Kadyrov, who had streets and districts in Chechnya named after Putin, wrote on Telegram. “I’m a foot soldier. If there’s an order – I follow it.” Two Chechen insiders familiar with the inner workings of Kadyrov’s government told Al Jazeera that, despite the deferential tones, Kadyrov has had a falling-out with Putin over his preferred successor – his third son, Adam Kadyrov, who turned 17 last November. The sources requested anonymity, as rights groups have previously documented a harsh crackdown on dissent in Chechnya, including the persecution of Kadyrov critics and their loved ones. “Putin refused to have Adam as a successor,” one of the sources said. In 2023, Ramzan posted a video purporting to show his son in a pretrial detention centre assaulting a Russian man who had burned a copy of the Quran. Ramzan said he was “proud” of Adam, who federal investigators said cannot face assault charges because of his age. The younger Kadyrov has been appointed to several official positions, including head of Chechnya’s security council. But according to one of the sources, he has been “raised as a prince” and has limited experience of the “real world”. According to Chechnya’s constitution, no one below 30 can head it. At the time of the 2004 assassination of his father, Akhmat, Ramzan was 28. Akhmat was a mufti and separatist strongman who switched sides after conflicts with puritan separatists who rejected Chechnya’s Sufi traditions. Akhmat was killed in a bomb blast, and Ramzan at the time relied on figureheads before officially becoming Chechnya’s leader in 2007. Adam will turn 30 in 2037. Kadyrov senior reportedly has necrotising pancreatitis, a health condition with a low survival rate, and kidney problems that require frequent dialysis. The sources Al Jazeera interviewed claimed he was hospitalised several times in critical condition, and spends hours in the AiMed Family Clinic in Chechnya’s administrative capital, Grozny, every day and often stays overnight. Kadyrov also resorts to prerecorded videos that are broadcast for several consecutive days to create the illusion of his busy, uninterrupted work schedule, they said. Al Jazeera was unable to independently verify their claims, which are consistent with other media reports about Kadyrov’s reported ailing health. The illness has reportedly forced Kadyrov to break unwritten rules. For the first time in two decades, he did not record a television address to congratulate Chechens when the holy month of Ramadan ended in late March. He also did not take part in this year’s February 24 commemorations of theStalinist 1944 deportationof the entire Chechen community to Central Asia. Kadyrov is “very worried” about his family’s destiny after his death, according to Ansar Dishni of Nyiso, a Telegram channel that publishes insider news from Chechnya. “Of course, the Kremlin has given his family security guarantees, but everything can change because Putin is also not forever,” Dishni told Al Jazeera. So far, Apti Alaudinov, a 51-year-old top security official in Chechnya, is the Kremlin’s preferred successor, the sources said. Alaudinov is a poster boy of Chechens fighting on Russia’s side in Ukraine, even though the forces he commands have been ridiculed for staging videos of “participating” in the hostilities. Al Jazeerareportedthat these forces barely distinguished themselves in combat and mostly have topoliceRussia-occupied areas in Ukraine. For years, Kadyrov has been reportedly investing in real estate and businesses in the United Arab Emirates and other Middle Eastern nations, creating a financial haven for his family. Others have followed suit. “Chechens are among our best buyers,” a Russian-speaking real estate agent in Dubai told Al Jazeera. “They show up with bags of cash.” Three decades ago, Chechnya was a hotbed of separatism beset by kidnappings, assassinations and abject poverty. “At one point, some believed that Chechnya’s status as part of the Russian Federation could serve as a guarantee against further degradation of the human rights situation,” Ivar Dale, a senior policy adviser with the Norwegian Helsinki Committee, a rights watchdog, told Al Jazeera. But after two devastating wars and a decades-long, violent crackdown on “extremism” in the wider North Caucasus region, Chechnya has by far become Russia’s most privileged province. Moscow floods it with federal funds that are reportedly misappropriated by Kadyrov, who has built palatial, heavily fortified residences, boasted a collection of luxurious sports cars and invited champion boxer Mike Tyson, as well as Western celebrities to perform at public concerts on his birthday. Human rights groups accuse him and his personal guards of extrajudicial killings, torture, abduction and the destruction of properties that belong to alleged “extremists”. Dale said Chechnya’s human rights abuses are being replicated in other Russian regions and Russia-occupied parts of Ukraine. “The most horrific abuses in Chechnya have become the standard for Russia in general,” Dale said. Observers believe little will change after Kadyrov’s death and the appointment of his successor. But whoever rules Chechnya next “may try to use Kadyrov’s image in a negative key as a figure the people allegedly got rid of to present himself as a good-willed reformer”, Dishni of the Nyiso Telegram channel concluded.",

    "article_text": "The leader of Tanzania’s main opposition party has appeared in court at a hearing in an ongoing trial on charges of treason, in which he potentially faces the death penalty. Tundu Lissu issued a message of defiance to supporters on Monday as he took his place in the dock at Kisutu Resident Magistrate’s Court in the capital, Dar-es-Salaam. The trial has added to rising concerns across East Africa about threats to democracy. Lissu entered the courtroom with his fist raised in the air as supporters chanted, “No reforms, no election”, according to a video of the courtroom shared by his Chadema party on X. “We will be fine. … Don’t worry at all,” Lissu said as he addressed supporters. The opposition leader, who came second in the 2020 presidential election, insisted on attending the proceedings in person after being forced to appear via videolink from prison for an earlier hearing on April 24. Lissu, who was shot 16 times in a 2017 attack, wascharged with treasonlast month over what prosecutors said was a speech calling on the public to rebel and disrupt presidential and legislative elections scheduled for October. His Chadema party has beendisqualified from this year’s pollsafter demanding changes to an electoral process that it said favours the ruling party, Chama Cha Mapinduzi, which has been in power since the country’s independence from British rule in 1961. #NoReformsNoElectionpic.twitter.com/DYxD1RauWl — Chadema Tanzania (@ChademaTZ2)May 19, 2025 A series of high-profile arrests has highlighted the rights record of President Samia Suluhu Hassan, who plans to seek re-election in October. She has insisted that the government is committed to respecting human rights. However, several Kenyan rights activists, including a former justice minister, said they were denied entry to Tanzania as they tried to travel to attend Lissu’s trial. The former minister, Martha Karua, a prominent lawyer and opposition politician, and former Supreme Court President Willy Mutunga were among those detained when they landed at Julius Nyerere International Airport in Dar-es-Salaam, they said on X. Tanzania’s immigration spokesperson Paul Mselle did not immediately respond to requests for comment. “Today was going to be a big day, and we went out there in solidarity,” Karua told the Kenyan broadcaster NTV on Monday after she was denied entry and sent back to Nairobi. “The state cannot be used as a personal tool. You cannot deport people whom you don’t like, who are not aligned to your views.” We,@WMutunga,@Honeyfarsafiand I, have been detained at Julius  Nyerere Airport, Dar es Salaam as we came in for the observance of@TunduALissu’s case. The trip was in solidarity with Tanzania lawyers and human rights defenders. They have not given reasons for the detention.pic.twitter.com/ad8UVtT4me — husseinkhalid (@husskhalid)May 19, 2025 Mutunga and rights activist Hussein Khalid were being held in an interrogation room at Julius Nyerere airport on Monday and were expected to be deported, Khalid said on X. Karua said last month that Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda were “collaborating” in their “total erosion of democratic principles” amid rising concerns regarding democracy across East Africa. Ethiopia’s leading opposition party, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front, was banned from any political activity last week, before elections due by June 2026 at the latest. South Sudan has repeatedly delayed holding its first national elections, and President Salva Kiir has placed longtime rival First Vice President Riek Macharunder house arrest. Rwandan President Paul Kagame last yearwon re-election with more than 99 percentof the vote amid long-running accusations of repression targeting the opposition.",

    "article_text": "From keyboard-like scissor switches, custom modules, and software-only variants, there’s something for everyone.﻿ From keyboard-like scissor switches, custom modules, and software-only variants, there’s something for everyone.﻿ byJess Weatherbed If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Elgato announced a new “Stream Deck Everywhere” strategy at Computex, which includes a software-based virtual Stream Deck for PCs, an ethernet dock accessory, unbranded Stream Deck modules that can bring its keys into other products, and even new scissor-switch keys for a more precise, keyboard-like feel. “With these launches, we’re opening up Stream Deck to a world of new users, from developers and DIY builders to manufacturers seeking a field-proven interface for their products,” said Elgato general manager Julian Fest. “Because Stream Deck isn’t just a device—it’s a platform. Stream Deck Modules are designed for hobbyists and manufacturers to easily integrate into hardware projects instead of ripping apart the consumer version or developing their own custom macropad solutions. The modules are available in 6-, 15-, and 32-key variants and are housed in an aluminum chassis that can be built into custom bases, machines, and furniture, making it possible to actually createElgato’s ridiculous 1,262-key April Fools’ desk. The Stream Deck Modules are available now starting at $49.99 for the six-key version, $129.99 for the 15-key, and $199.99 for the 32-key. Elgato technical marketing manager Philipp Eggebrecht toldThe Vergethat discounts will be offered for bulk purchases. A new variant of theMK.2 Stream Deckhas been introduced that replaces the membrane keys with scissor-style switches that provide “enhanced speed and precision,” according to Elgato. Eggebrecht says the scissor keys variant costs $149.99 and will be available in “around two weeks.” Stream Deck buttons that feel more like keyboard keys would make it easier for users to tell they’ve clicked something without having to look at the device. Elgato describes the scissor switch variant as something that “lends itself to typing-style interactions, paving the way for new use cases that benefit from rapid, multi-layered input and control,” which could be testing the waters for aStream Deck keyboardor any other application requiring precise controls. “The idea of a full LCD-key based keyboard is interesting. We’ve explored it in the past and so far, what we’ve found is that the experience hasn’t been great, and there’s the cost question,” Eggebrecht toldThe Verge. “We’re getting closer to a keyboard feeling with Stream Deck Scissor Keys, and always looking at the technology and what is becoming possible. Stream Deck and keyboards are a natural fit.” Elgato is also rolling out a software-only Stream Deck for desktop devices, akin to theexisting Stream Deck mobile app. The Virtual Stream Deck (VSD) can provide a permanent macro menu on computer screens or be summoned at will when users hit allocated hotkeys and mouse buttons. The VSD software will initially be available for people who own a Corsair Scimitar Elite Wireless SE mouse, Xenon Edge touchscreen, or any Stream Deck model, before later rolling out to “more devices.” Custom layouts, virtual faceplates, and support for beyond six buttons require iPhone and Android Stream Deck users to pay for Pro access, which starts at $2.99 monthly or $49.99 as a one-time purchase. Eggebrecht says Elgato’s desktop VSD isn’t locked behind a subscription, but does require users to install the Stream Deck 7.0 beta. A new $79.99 Stream Deck network dock accessory was also announced that includes support for power over Ethernet (PoE), which lets you place its buttons anywhere there’s a network jack, and with more flexibility than USB-C affords by itself. Eggebrecht says the Stream Deck network dock will start shipping in August.

    "title": "The best Garmin watches for training and everyday life",
    "article_text": "Garmin may be best known for its hardcore fitness watches, but it’s got an extensive line of lifestyle offerings, too. Garmin may be best known for its hardcore fitness watches, but it’s got an extensive line of lifestyle offerings, too. byVictoria Song If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Few brands are as synonymous with outdoor sports as Garmin. You’ll find these fitness trackers and smartwatches on dozens of wrists at any 5K, marathon, or Ironman. You’ll also find Garmin devotees among divers, thru-hikers, golfers, kiteboarders — you name it. But these devices aren’tjustfor athletes. The company’s made significant strides in its lifestyle offerings, so regardless of your fitness level, there’s a Garmin for everyone. If you’re coming from a more traditional smartwatch, Garmin’s core strengths lie in fitness, GPS, adventuring, and durability. These are hardy devices that are meant to withstand the elements and lastweekson a single charge. Several models come with offline maps, advanced navigational features, and more training metrics than any other platform. Garmin devices tend to be on the pricier side, however, andthe company recently announcedit would begin putting its newest features behind a paywall. That’s a bummer given Garmin spent years publicly stating it had no intention of charging its users extra. There are fitness trackers and smartwatches, and then there are Garmins. Depending on the type of Garmin — there aremany— we will tailor our benchmarks and experiential, real-life testing. If it’s a rugged Fenix model, we’ll go on extensive GPS activities, see how well it works as a navigation tool, and dive deep into training metrics. If it’s more lifestyle focused, like the Venu 3, we’ll put an added focus on how well smart features like voice assistant access, notifications, and style. Because people buy Garmins to last a long time, we also put special consideration on battery life testing. Some other factors we consider are durability, performance, ability to connect to gym equipment, and GPS accuracy. Garmins are known for extra long battery life. The question is, does it last days, weeks, or even a month? Garmin has so many training features that even the pros probably don’t use all of them. Do you get coaching programs and stamina graphs? Or are you sticking to the basics like steps, pace, and mileage? Same goes for navigational features. While Garmin is known for its GPS tech, there are multiple kinds of GPS tracking and satellite systems. We also look at whether these navigational features fit the use case. For example, do running watches haveback-to-start? Do offline maps come preloaded for thru-hikers? Do these watches hold up to intense activity? Are they discreet enough to wear to formal occasions without screaming “I love exercise!!!!!” Garmins are expensive. Does the price make sense for the intended user, feature set, and build quality? Garmins aren’t too shabby on smarts, either. While more fitness-focused than anything from Apple, Google, or Samsung, there’s enough to get you the basics like notifications and then some. For example, most Garmins have fall detection and safety features, andseveral of the latest Garminsrecently gotan FDA-cleared EKG feature. (You’ll need a phone on hand, however, as only one Garmin model has cellular connectivity.) Many Garmin devices also support offline music playback and come with a small third-party app ecosystem. There are alotof Garmin watches to choose from. No, seriously, there are six major lineups, and each has a multitude of models. But no worries — I test several Garmins every year and can help point you in the right direction. 9 Verge Score More intuitive menu navigationMultiband GPSLong battery life — even with AOD enabledAdds helpful training featuresOh, oh, it’s OLED, you know It’s $100 more than the 255OLED displays don’t cost $100 Sizes:42mm w/ 18mm straps; 46mm w/ 22mm straps /Weight:39g (42mm); 47g (46mm) /Battery life:Up to 15 days (42mm); 13 days (46mm) in smartwatch mode /Display type:OLED touchscreen /GPS:All-systems GNSS and dual-frequency GPS /Connectivity:Bluetooth, Ant Plus, Wi-Fi /Water resistance:5ATM /Music storage:8GB Garmin hasmanyrunning watches, and a lot of them are great. But the Forerunner 265 or 265S (if you have petite wrists) strikes an excellent balance between price, feature set, battery life, and a vibrant OLED display. That said, the Forerunner 265 / 265S is a bit of an odd duck. It comes a mere nine months after its predecessor, theForerunner 255, and is, in many ways, pretty much the same watch. The main difference is the 265 has an OLED display compared to the 255’s memory-in-pixel screen. Usually, that means worse battery life, but in this case, we got about a week on a single charge with the always-on display enabled. Without it, you can get up to 15 days. Given that OLED is easier to read and just, well, looks nicer, that gives the 265 lineup an edge over the 255. The 265 also has dual-frequency GPS (also known as multi-band). The gist is you get much more accurate maps in challenging environments like cities and dense forests because you can access both the L1 and L5 satellite frequencies. And even with dual-frequency GPS enabled, you still don’t lose a whole lot of battery life. I wore it during a half marathon with that and the AOD enabled, and I still had over 80 percent battery by the time I got home. This is also an excellent price, as the majority of multi-band GPS watches cost well over $600. My main complaint is that $450, while not bad for Garmin, is still a lot when you consider that’s the same price as smarter smartwatches with great running features. Some runners won’t care. But if you’re on a budget — or you’re new to running and feel iffy about spending that much — then consider theForerunner 165series. It starts at $250 (add another $50 for onboard music) and does almost everything the 265 series does. The main things you’re missing are dual-frequency GPS and a few more niche sport profiles. But if you’re mostly sticking to running, gym equipment, cycling, swimming, and hiking, you’re covered. The Garmin Forerunner 165 Music gets you in-depth training metrics but leaves out some of the more advanced features in exchange for a more palatable price. Neither has all of Garmin’s training features, but it’s got what you’ll need to run anything from a 5K to a full marathon. That includes a Race Predictor, which gives you an estimate of what your best time would be based on your actual training. You can also use PacePro to figure out your pacing strategy for a race. You also get Garmin’s Training Readiness feature to help gauge load and recovery, Garmin Coach plans, and a host of running form metrics. It also supports offline music and safety features like fall detection. The only thing they lack is advanced mapping. (They still have trackback, point-to-point navigation, and real-time breadcrumb trail support, however.) 8 Verge Score Now comes in multiple sizesHands-free flashlight is SO handyGreat battery lifeMultiband GPSUpgraded heart rate sensorStarting price hasn’t changed AOD zaps battery life to three to four daysLots of incremental changesIt’s a Garmin review, so once again, the app Sizes:42mm w/ 20mm straps; 47mm w/ 22mm straps; 51mm w/ 26mm straps /Weight:42mm: 63g stainless steel, 58g titanium; 47mm: 78g stainless steel, 70g titanium; 51mm: 98g stainless steel, 88g titanium /Battery life:42mm: up to 10 days (4 with AOD); 47mm: up to 16 days (6 with AOD); 51mm: up to 31 days (11 with AOD) /Display type:OLED /GPS:All-systems GNSS and dual-frequency GPS /Connectivity:Bluetooth, Ant Plus, Wi-Fi /Water resistance:10ATM /Music storage:Up to 32GB TheEpix Prowill get you every fitness feature that Garmin has to offer. And I meaneverything. It would frankly be easier to tell you what the Epix Pro does not have: things that are limited to LTE smartwatches and some of the new smart features on the Fenix 8, like an on-board voice assistant. Otherwise, you’ve got topographical maps, turn-by-turn navigation, and more training metrics than even a seasoned triathlete would know what to do with. The Pro is more size-inclusive than thestandard second-gen Epix, which only comes in 47mm. You can get the Pro in that size, too, but it also comes in 42mm and 51mm. This was a major complaint I had with the second-gen Epix, and you love to see companies actually take this sort of thing seriously. The best part is the Pro models start at the same price as the regular Epix did. You’ll have to pay $100 extra for materials like titanium and sapphire crystal, but that’s also true of the standard Epix. 7 Verge Score Smartens up Garmin’s flagship multisport watchExcellent battery and fitness trackingOffers MIP and OLED display optionsCondenses the Fenix and Epix lines into one The starting price is$350more than the Fenix 7!Smart features are less helpful without LTE That said, it muddies the waters if you’re trying to pick between the Epix Pro,Fenix 7,Fenix 7 Pro, and now, theFenix 8. The main difference is the Epix watches all have OLED displays. One reason I prefer OLED is that they’re much easier to read indoors — where most of us spend the majority of our time. The Fenix 7 series’ memory-in-pixel displays (plus solar charging if you opt for it) allow for weeks and weeks of charge, but the smallest Epix Pro can get around 10 days with normal usage. The 47mm and 51mm Pro models can go longer between charges due to bigger batteries, but I felt that the 42mm has enough juice to satisfy most use cases. Garmin also has so many battery-saving modes and options that I highly doubt this will ever be an issue. Not helping matters is the fact that the Fenix 8 lets you choose between an OLED or a MIP display. You also get smart features like an onboard voice assistant, the ability to take calls from the wrist, and the Garmin Messenger app. The main problem is the starting price is now $350 more than the standard Fenix 7 and right about on par with the Epix Pro. My personal feeling is the Fenix 8’s smart features are just okay and that you’re really not missing much by not having them. We also often see discounts on older models, so I would put on my bargain-hunting hat for a discounted Epix Pro or Fenix 7 Pro while inventory is still available. But really, the winning feature of the Epix Pro is the hands-free flashlight. It’s so useful in my day-to-day life, and all you have to do is double-press a button. It’s as bright as your smartphone, comes with a red light option if you want something easier on the eyes, and can act as a strobe in an emergency situation. The Fenix 7 Pro and 8 watches also have a flashlight, so a lot of this is going to come down to personal preference for the display, price, and whether you care about smart features. 8 Verge Score Hands-free flashlightLong battery lifeMultiband GPSUpgraded heart rate monitor The improved MIP display is still not the easiest to read in dim lightingToo similar to the standard Fenix 7 If you’re set on the most battery life possible, I recommend the Fenix 7 Pro over the standard 7 for a few reasons. Its MIP display is slightly brighter, all sizes have the flashlight, and, like the Epix Pro, it has an updated sensor array. I also recommend it over the MIP versions of the Fenix 8 because it comes in more sizes,andcosts around $300 less. Especially since the Fenix 8’s smart features are a bit half-baked. 8 Verge Score Aesthetically pleasing and accurate trackingGood for smaller wristsAffordable priceThe hidden OLED is cool The Garmin app is overly complicatedBattery life is shorter than other hybrids Sizes:40mm w/ 20mm straps /Weight:19g /Battery life:Up to 5 days /Display type:“Hidden” OLED touchscreen /GPS:Tethered GPS /Connectivity:Bluetooth, Ant Plus /Water resistance:5ATM /Music storage:N/A What I love most about the Vivomove Sport is that it doesn’t look like what most people expect from a Garmin. It’s a hybrid smartwatch, which means it looks like a regular watch but can track fitness and deliver notifications. Garmin’s hybrids are also unique in that they all use an OLED display that stays hidden until you need it. This is best suited for a casually active person who wants style and value in a lightweight package. Think wellness, more so than fitness. It gets you continuous heart rate monitoring and blood oxygen level monitoring, and can even provide abnormal heart rate alerts. You also get access to more in-depth metrics like respiration rate, fitness age, stress, and Body Battery, which is Garmin’s tool for visualizing how well-rested you are. For smart features, you get all the basics, like notifications, alarms, and timers. The Sport isn’t quite as full-featured as some other Garmin watches you’ll find on this list. For instance, you’re giving up built-in GPS in favor of tethered GPS through your phone. There are no contactless payments, nor is there a microphone or speaker for taking calls on the wrist. But thisisa budget pick, and you get a lot, considering this is an entry-level gadget that could pass for a Swatch at a glance. I don’t love that the battery life is short for a hybrid, at around three to four days. Even so, that’s still much better than what you’ll get on an Apple Watch or Wear OS 4 watch. If you’re willing to spend about $100 more, the $269.99Vivomove Trendhas more chic materials, gets you more screen real estate, and wireless Qi charging. Otherwise, this is a great lifestyle wearable that can serve as a classier alternative to your typical fitness band. The Garmin Lily 2 is a simple yet chic hybrid analog smartwatch that delivers basic fitness tracking, notifications, and up to five days of battery life. If you prefer something newer to the Sport that’s also stylish, theGarmin Lily 2is another good option, especially if you’ve got particularly small wrists or prefer something extremely lightweight. The swipe and tap gestures are still a little fiddly to use — which was also the case with the first-gen model — but the fresh design isa fun way to lightly monitor your fitnesswithout bogging yourself down with notifications. Garmin also offers theLily 2 Active, which adds a physical button, GPS, and support for more sports tracking for astarting price of $299.99. 8 Verge Score Bright displayLong battery lifeTons of training and health features Cluttered appProprietary USB-A charger Sizes:40mm w/ 20mm straps /Weight:38g /Battery life:Up to 11 days /Display type:OLED touchscreen /GPS:All-systems GNSS /Connectivity:Bluetooth, Ant Plus /Water resistance:5ATM /Music storage:4GB (for Music Edition) If you were disappointed by theFitbit Sense 2andVersa 4, the Venu Sq 2 is the next best thing (and, in some ways, better). At a glance, the Venu Sq 2 could easily be mistaken for an Apple Watch. On the wrist, you’ll notice it’s made of plastic, but it still looks quite chic and extremely lightweight. The screen is bright, easy to read, and looks better than any Versa or Sense ever did. The feature set is also great for the price, with built-in GPS, a ton of watch faces, emergency safety features, and contactless payments. If you pay $50 more for the Music Edition, you’ll also get about 500 songs worth of storage, but we wouldn’t recommend it. This doesn’t have cellular connectivity and, therefore, isn’t truly standalone. You’ll most likely be carrying your phone with you anyway. As for health features, the Venu Sq 2 basically has everything you’d get on a Versa or Sense smartwatch but with Garmin’s treasure trove of metrics as well. That includes heart rate tracking, blood oxygen tracking, intensity minutes (how much moderate exercise you get in a week), stress tracking, hydration tracking, respiratory rate, period tracking, and Garmin’s recovery feature, Body Battery. As far as fitness goes, you also get access to Garmin Coach, which provides free 5K, 10K, and half marathon training plans. You love to see it. Another big leg-up Garmin has over Fitbit? None of these features or metrics are locked behind a paywall, even if Garmin’s AI-powered insights and a few other expanded features will only be available as part of Garmin Connect Plus ($6.99 a month / $69.99 annually). 7 Verge Score Good battery lifeBetter sleep tracking and nap detectionEKG and AFib featuresCan take calls and use your phone’s voice assistantAudio meditation sessions done well Pricey compared to other lifestyle smartwatchesLimited third-party app ecosystemNo LTE capability Sizes:41mm w/ 18mm straps; 45mm w/ 22mm straps /Weight:40g for the 3S; 47g for the 3 /Battery life:Up to 10 days for 3S; 14 days for 3 /Display type:OLED touchscreen /GPS:GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO /Connectivity:Bluetooth, Ant Plus, Wi-Fi /Water resistance:5ATM /Music storage:8GB Garmin has shored up the smarts in its watches over the past several years, and the Venu 3 series is the smartest (and most affordable) of the bunch. The Venu 3 series comes in two sizes: 41mm and 45mm. Like theVenu 2 Plus, it has a microphone and speaker. You can take calls directly from the wrist and issue commands to your phone’s digital assistant via Bluetooth. It’s not the same as having Siri, Bixby, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant built directly into the watch, but it’s a clever workaround that works well for hands-free control. It also supports safety features like fall detection and live tracking, as well as contactless payments. Like other OLED Garmins, the display is both vibrant and easy to read. As for health and fitness, you get a nice mix of basic and more advanced features and metrics. It has Garmin’s latest heart rate sensor, which enables FDA-cleared EKG and AFib detection features. Overall, it leans a bit more on the wellness and health side of things, with intensity minutes, blood oxygen monitoring, sleep tracking, period tracking, abnormal heart rate alerts, and stress tracking. As for training, you still get built-in GPS, VO2 Max, heart rate zones, respiration rate, and downloadable training plans via Garmin Coach. New to the 3 and 3S is a sleep coach that factors in metrics like heart rate variability and recent activity to determine your sleep needs. It also finally adds nap detection, a feature that’s been long overdue for the Garmin platform. The Venu 3 series also adds audio-guided meditation sessions, and you can view how these sessions directly impact your metrics. From an accessibility standpoint, this also adds a new wheelchair mode. Technically, the new Fenix 8 is slightly smarter in that it adds an on-board voice assistant. However, it is also more than double the price and not what I’d consider a good value for the average athlete. It’s more for people who spend hours upon hours training every week. This is the Garmin for you if you want the platform’s in-depth training without sacrificing the productivity of a smartwatch. The main things it’s lacking are cellular options and a robust third-party app ecosystem. That said, it’s got Spotify, Amazon Music, and Deezer for offline listening. It’s also a good option if you’re fed up with MIP displays and want asmarterGarmin rather than a full-on smartwatch.

    "article_text": "From carrier promos to straight discounts, the deals landscape is dotted with ways to save on your monthly bills. From carrier promos to straight discounts, the deals landscape is dotted with ways to save on your monthly bills. bySheena VasaniandCameron Faulkner If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. So far, 2025 has been a great year for watching new, must-see TV shows and movies on subscription services.But if you, like many of us, have more concurrent subscriptions than you care to admit, you’ll agree that keeping up with the latest each month is expensive. They may not cost as much as most of the tech we cover, but it adds up. If you’re trying to cut down on your expenses, you might be able to do so while holding onto your precious subscriptions. Several services offer ongoing promos, some of which are even available to new and returning subscribers alike. Below, we’ve curated some of the best deals going on right now, so you can enjoy streaming your favorite show or movie for less than it would typically cost you. Most streaming services offer free trials that typically last from a week to a month, whether you sign up for an annual membership or just a monthly subscription. However, you will likely have to provide your credit card information in advance, and you will be charged once your trial is over, so make a note in your calendar if you don’t want to be charged. Some streaming platforms offer student discounts. These include Hulu, Paramount Plus, YouTube TV, Amazon Prime, and more. You’ll have to prove your student eligibility through a sign-up form and typically be enrolled in an accredited Title IV college or university to take advantage of these deals. Peacockis NBCUniversal’s streaming service, one that offers next-day programming from NBC (and Bravo). The platform also provides access to live sports programming, including Sunday Night Football and WWE, as well as movies and shows likeThe Wild Robot,Conclave,Wicked,Oppenheimer,Yellowstone,Teacup,The Office,Saturday Night Live, Rian Johnson’sPoker Face, and theforthcomingThe Officespinoff,The Paper.

Only the latter lets you download content for offline viewing. In terms of deals, new and returning subscriberscan get a year of ad-supported Peacock Premiumfor $24.99 ($55 off) when they use promo codeSPRINGSAVINGSat checkout through May 30th.

The $15.99 per month service includes Dolby Atmos sound, as well as the ability to download TV shows and movies on up to 10 devices. For just a dollar more,Disney offersan ad-supported, $10.99-a-month Duo Basic subscription that brings together Disney Plus and Hulu. To enjoy an ad-free experience across both services, the cost is $19.99 per month. There’s also the $16.99-a-month Disney Bundle Trio Basic bundle, which includes the ad-supported Hulu and ESPN Plus (paying $26.99 a month nets you the ad-free version of Hulu and Disney Plus, though ESPN will still have ads). That’s cheaper than subscribing to all three streaming services individually, and is the wisest route to take if you want all three. That being said, there are other ways to save, particularly with carrier promos. Those currently onone of Verizon’s Unlimited plans, for instance, can get Disney Plus Trio Basic with adsfor $10 a monthinstead of $16.99. If you already subscribe to Verizon’s existing Legacy bundle, you can also continue to enjoy ad-free Disney Plus, as well as ad-supported ESPN Plus and Hulu, for $15 per month ($6 off).

    "article_text": "You’ll see a ‘Buy’ button alongside an audiobook’s price. You’ll see a ‘Buy’ button alongside an audiobook’s price. byEmma Roth It’s finally possible to purchase an audiobook from Spotify’s iPhone app with just a few taps. On Monday,Spotify announced that Appleapproved an update that allows users in the US to see audiobook pricing within the app and buy individual audiobooks outside the App Store. The update also lets Spotify Premium subscribers purchase additional audiobook listening hours. This change follows last month’sEpic Games vs. Appleruling, whichupended the iPhone maker’s controlover the App Store. Under the ruling, Apple can’t collect fees on purchases made outside the app store, nor can it govern how developers point to external purchases. Spotify submitted the updatelast week, but now it’s official. The music streaming servicepulled audiobook purchasesfrom its iOS app in 2022 after accusing Apple of “choking competition” with App Store rules that made it more difficult to purchase audiobooks. Spotify alsostarted letting iPhone users purchasesubscriptions outside the App Store earlier this month. TheiOS apps for Kindle,Patreon, andDelta’s emulatorhave also taken advantage of the court ruling, but Epic Games isstill fighting to bringFortnitebackto the App Store. “This change lowers the barriers for more users to embrace their first — or tenth — audiobook, while allowing publishers and authors to reach fans and access new audiences seamlessly,” Spotify said in its announcement.

Several failed dice rolls led to these figures making it out into the world. There’s no other explanation. byCameron Faulkner WizKids didBaldur’s Gate 3dirty with its new D&D Icons of the Realms collection of miniature figures. The anticipated collection based on the beloved RPG (my personal 2023 GOTY) launched in April, and some buyers noticed that the characters look nothing — and I meannothing— like how they were advertised. These cursed recreations of Shadowheart, Astarion, Karlach, Gale, Wyll, and Lae’zel look like unlicensed knockoffs when they are, in fact, officially licensed by Wizards of the Coast. And, it costs $50 for the set! Anyone who has played the game, or at least seen its cover art numerous times, knows what these characters should look like. They don’t look like 3D-printed discards predestined for the garbage bin, with little to no effort made to look authentic, unless perhaps you’re squinting from 10 feet away. In response to buyers posting pictures of the botched figures on social media and retail sites, and likely fromGamesRadarand other sites posting about it last week,WizKids posted an apologyto buyers — and to Wizards of the Coast. In it, it details how to get a refund or a replacement to anyone who bought them online or at a local games store. Keep them, replace them, destroy them, pray to them. It’s up to you.

    "article_text": "﻿The complaint comes as the voice actor strike enters its ninth month. ﻿The complaint comes as the voice actor strike enters its ninth month. byAsh Parrish SAG-AFTRA, the organization that represents voice, motion, and screen performers, has filed anunfair labor complaint against Epic Games. The complaint stems from the company’s recent introduction of an AI programmed to sound likeJames Earl Jones’ Darth Vader that can respond to a player’s actions and questions. SAG-AFTRA wrote in a statement that it understands its members and members’ estates wish to use AI technology in any way they choose. “However,” SAG-AFTRA’s statement continued, “we must protect our right to bargain terms and conditions around uses of voice that replace the work of our members, including those who previously did the work of matching Darth Vader’s iconic rhythm and tone in video games.” While the AI “revolution” slowly replaces human workers with oftentimes inferior products, and despitesome members’ distaste for the practice,SAG-AFTRA has embraced the idea of using AItrained to replicate an actor’s performance. It hasestablished contracts and partnerships with several AI companieswith the idea being members can use this technology with specific contract-guaranteed protections. So the act of using an AI to replace Darth Vader’s voice performers (both the late James Earl Jones and those brought in after his death to match his performance) isn’t what SAG-AFTRA is objecting to. Rather, it’s the fact that this was done without Epic Games sitting down with SAG-AFTRA at the bargaining table to hash out the specifics. “Fortnite’s signatory company, Llama Productions, chose to replace the work of human performers with AI technology,” SAG-AFTRA wrote. “Unfortunately, they did so without providing any notice of their intent to do this and without bargaining with us over appropriate terms.”The Vergehas reached out to Epic Games for comment. AI and its use in video game voice and motion performanceis the main stumbling block in the ongoing video game voice actor strike. Negotiations between SAG-AFTRA and the signatory companies of its interactive media agreement broke down last year, and performers have been on strike since July — a length of time that eclipses both the actors and writers strikes of 2023.

    "title": "Trump signs the Take It Down Act into law",
    "article_text": "The bill sailed through Congress with a focus on deepfakes and other nonconsensual intimate images. The bill sailed through Congress with a focus on deepfakes and other nonconsensual intimate images. byLauren Feiner President Donald Trump signed the Take It Down Act into law, enacting a bill that will criminalize the distribution of nonconsensual intimate images (NCII) — including AI deepfakes — and require social media platforms to promptly remove them when notified. The bill sailed through both chambers of Congress with several tech companies, parent and youth advocates, and first lady Melania Trump championing the issue. But critics — including a group that’s made it its mission to combat the distribution of such images — warn that its approach could backfire andharm the very survivors it seeks to protect. The law makes publishing NCII, whether real or AI-generated, criminally punishable by up to three years in prison, plus fines. It also requires social media platforms to have processes to remove NCII within 48 hours of being notified and “make reasonable efforts” to remove any copies. The Federal Trade Commission is tasked with enforcing the law, and companies have a year to comply. “I’m going to use that bill for myself, too” Under any other administration, the Take It Down Act would likely see much of the pushback it does today by groups like theElectronic Frontier Foundation(EFF) andCenter for Democracy and Technology(CDT), which warn the takedown provision could be used to remove or chill a wider array of content than intended, as well as threaten privacy-protecting technologies like encryption, since services that use it would have no way of seeing (or removing) the messages between users. But actions by the Trump administration in his first 100 days in office — including breaching Supreme Court precedent byfiring the two Democratic minority commissioners at the FTC— have added another layer of fear for some of the law’s critics, who worry it could be used to threaten or stifle political opponents. Trump, after all, saidduring an address to Congress this yearthat once he signed the bill, “I’m going to use that bill for myself, too, if you don’t mind, because nobody gets treated worse than I do online. Nobody.” The Cyber Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI), which advocates for legislation combating image-based abuse, has long pushed for the criminalization of nonconsensual distribution of intimate images (NDII). But the CCRI said it could not support the Take It Down Act because it may ultimately provide survivors with “false hope.” On Bluesky, CCRI President Mary Anne Frankscalled the takedown provisiona “poison pill … that will likely end up hurting victims more than it helps.” “Platforms that feel confident that they are unlikely to be targeted by the FTC (for example, platforms that are closely aligned with the current administration) may feel emboldened to simply ignore reports of NDII,” they wrote. “Platforms attempting to identify authentic complaints may encounter a sea of false reports that could overwhelm their efforts and jeopardize their ability to operate at all.” In an interview withThe Verge, Franks expressed concern that it could be “hard for people to parse” the takedown provision. “This is going to be a year-long process,” she said. “I think that as soon as that process has happened, you’ll then be seeing the FTC being very selective in how they treat supposed non-compliance with the statute. It’s not going to be about putting the power in the hands of depicted individuals to actually get their content removed.” Trump, during his signing ceremony, dismissively referenced criticism of the bill. “People talked about all sorts of First Amendment, Second Amendment… they talked about any amendment they could make up, and we got it through,” he said. Legal challenges to the most problematic parts may not come immediately, however, according to Becca Branum, deputy director of CDT’s Free Expression Project. “It’s so ambiguously drafted that I think it’ll be hard for a court to parse when it will be enforced unconstitutionally” before platforms have to implement it, Branum said. Eventually, users could sue if they have lawful content removed from platforms, and companies could ask a court to overturn the law if the FTC investigates or penalizes them for breaking it — it just depends on how quickly enforcement ramps up.

    "title": "How to manage your bookmarks in Google Chrome",
    "article_text": "﻿Bookmarks can be key to staying organized on the web. ﻿Bookmarks can be key to staying organized on the web. byDavid Nield There’s a lot to look at, watch, and listen to on the web. Fully utilizing the bookmarks feature in Google Chrome can be a real help in staying on top of everything. Chrome is the browser I use most often, and I’ve got a huge number of bookmarked sites inside it: long reads I want to get back to once work is done, news updates to write up for work, gift ideas, apps I’d like to check out, important Slack channels, and content systems for my job... the list goes on. All synced between devices and available everywhere. If you haven’t done a deep dive into Chrome’s bookmarks feature then you might not be aware of everything you can do with it, how it can save you time, and how you can bring some kind of order to your web browsing. The star icon to the right of the address bar in Chrome on the desktop is for saving new bookmarks. Click it and the current page gets saved to the most recently used bookmarks folder. You can also pressCtrl+D(Windows) orCmd+D(macOS), which is even easier. On mobile, tap the three dots at the top then the star icon (Android), or the three dots at the bottom thenAdd to bookmarks(iOS) to save the current page as a new bookmark. As soon as a bookmark is saved, a small dialog pops up. You can use it to change the bookmark name and folder if you need to, or just clickDoneto move on. More options can be found on the desktop by clicking the three dots (top right) thenBookmarks and lists. You’re able to add bookmarks from this menu, too, and there’s also aBookmark all tabsoption, which saves every open tab (which,like tab groups, is handy if you need to do something else but want to be able to get back to where you are). On the sameBookmarks and listsmenu you can toggle the bookmarks bar on and off. The bookmarks bar sits just below the address bar, and gives you another way to add bookmarks: drag the URL of the site you’re viewing down from the address bar to the bookmarks bar. Bookmarks become a lot more useful when they’re well organized. On the desktop you can launch the full bookmarks manager by clickingBookmarkson the bookmarks bar, or by clicking the three dots (top right) and thenBookmarks and Lists > Bookmark Manager. You can search through your bookmarks here, and create new folders: Click the three dots (top right), thenAdd new folder— and yes, you can put folders inside other folders. (This is also where you’ll find theExportfeature, and it’s a good idea to export your bookmarks occasionally as a backup.) Folders are a key part of keeping your bookmarks organized, and they’re all accessible on the left of the bookmarks manager page. Click and drag bookmarks to change their order, or to move them into different folders. Right-click on a folder to rename or delete it, or drag it on top of another folder to put it inside that folder. You can double-click any bookmark to open it. To edit it, click the three dots to the right: You’re able to rename your bookmarks and change their URLs, as well as put them in different folders. If you right-click on a bookmarks folder, you get the option to open all the links it contains in separate tabs — which may not do your computer much good if there are dozens or hundreds of bookmarks in the folder. The bookmark manager can be accessed on mobile too, though you don’t get quite as many options to play around with. Tap the three dots at the top (Android) or bottom (iOS) of the interface, then chooseBookmarksto see the list. As long as you’re signed in with your Google account, bookmarks will sync between your devices. There are other ways to work with your bookmarks in Chrome. This has hopefully given you some idea of what you can do with bookmarks in Google Chrome. And there’s more, so it might be worth it to take some time and look around. It’s not the most sophisticated of systems, but it does give you plenty of flexibility in terms of how you can use it and what’s possible, so you can get your folders and shortcuts set up in the ways that work best for you.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 19, 2025 / 3:41 PM EDT/ CBS News Washington— President Trump on Monday signed a bipartisan bill into law that makes it a federal crime to post real and fake sexually explicit imagery online of people without their consent. The bill, known as the \"Take It Down Act,\" was backed by first lady Melania Trump, who made a rare public appearance in March at the U.S. Capitol to advocate for the bill's passage in the House. The billcleared the lower chamber last monthafter the Senate passed the measure in February. \"This will be the first-ever federal law to combat the distribution of explicit, imagery posted without subjects' consent,\" Mr. Trump said during a bill signing event at the White House. \"We will not tolerate online sexual exploitation.\" The law requires social media companies and other websites to remove images and videos, including deepfakes generated by artificial intelligence, within 48 hours after a victim's request. Those convicted of intentionally distributing explicit images without a subject's consent face prison time. \"It's heartbreaking to witness young teens, especially girls, grappling with the overwhelming challenges posed by malicious online content like deep fakes,\" the first lady said in March. \"This toxic environment can be severely damaging.\" The first lady attended Monday's bill signing, calling the law a \"national victory that will help parents and families protect children from online exploitation.\" She thanked the bipartisan group of lawmakers who worked on the legislation \"for coming together to prioritize people over politics.\" \"Artificial intelligence and social media are the digital candy for the next generation — sweet, addictive and engineered to have an impact on the cognitive development of our children,\" she said, adding that \"these new technologies can be weaponized, shape beliefs and, sadly, affect emotions and even be deadly.\" After Mr. Trump signed the bill into law, he handed it to his wife to also sign. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, as well as TikTok and Snapchat have all said they support the legislation. Digital rights groups, however, have warned that the legislation as written could lead to the suppression of lawful speech, including legitimate pornography, and does not contain protections against bad-faith takedown requests.

    "title": "Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis raises questions about screening",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 19, 2025 / 2:49 PM EDT/ CBS News Former President Joe Biden's diagnosiswith an advanced stage ofprostate cancerthat has metastasized, or spread, to his bones prompted anoutpouring of concernand questions about his condition. Those questions include how long the cancer may have taken to develop and whether he was screened for it during earlier checkups. While it's unclear exactly how long Biden has had cancer, its rapid spread is attributed to it being an aggressive form of the disease. His cancer was categorized as having a Gleason score of 9, which places him in Grade Group 5, the most severe category. The Gleason score is a system for grading the severity of prostate cancer based on analysis of cell samples under a microscope. When prostate cancer is more advanced and spreads, the bones are among the areas most likely to be affected. Itcan also commonly spreadto the lymph nodes, liver or lungs, according to the Mayo Clinic. Unfortunately, late-stage cancer diagnoses are not uncommon. A 2014 analysis from Cancer Research UK, for example, found that46% of all cancersin that country were diagnosed at an advanced stage. A2023 studypublished in the journal Lancet Oncology found disruptions in care amid the pandemic also led to an increase in late-stage diagnoses across nearly all cancer types, including prostate. Slower-growing cancers can take years to develop and be detected, while more aggressive ones can become apparent more rapidly and also spread to other parts of the body quicker. Biden, who is now 82, did not undergo prostate cancer screening during his last medical checkup while in office, in February 2024, according torecordsreleased at the time. Experts say this is likely due to that fact that these screenings arenot routinely recommendedfor men 70 years or older. \"Doctors will stop screening for prostate cancer at 75 or so, because after that, the prostate cancers you typically pick up are very slow growing, and so the harms of all of the testing and treatment for something that may not kill you — you're talking about risk versus benefit. It may not be worth the risk,\" Dr. Céline Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, explainedon \"CBS Mornings\" Monday. Instead, Biden's diagnosis came after he recently saw a doctor due to urinary symptoms.A small nodulewas found in the prostate, which necessitated further evaluation, his office said last week. \"Urinary symptoms are quite common in older men and are usually due to benign conditions like having an enlarged prostate,\" Gounder said. In this case, however, the testing discovered cancer. Gounder said the situation underscores the importance of tailoring medical decisions to the individual. \"He had new symptoms and is functionally active, which justified a closer look,\" she said. There have been advancements in treating advanced prostate cancer, and Gounder said the treatment goal in a case like this would be to control the cancer, slowing its progression and preserving quality of life. Biden's type of cancer is hormone-sensitive, which means it should respond to a testosterone-blocking treatment, Gounder said, adding that this might be combined with other medications or chemotherapy, depending on the specific case. Back in 2019, Biden was diagnosed with benign enlargement of the prostate, or BPH. That December, his campaign released his medical evaluation, which noted: \"This patient has been treated for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). This was initially treated with medication and was then definitively treated with surgery. He has never had prostate cancer.\" BPH is very common in older men, with around80% of menover 70 having it, according to Yale Medicine. Prostate cancer testing typically involves two methods: a prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, test and a digital rectal exam, or DRE. A PSA test is a type of blood test that can indicate a higher chance of prostate cancer but is not a definitive diagnosis. A DRE involves a doctor using a gloved finger to feel for any bumps on the prostate via the rectum. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent panel of national experts, say the decision on screening for prostate cancer among men aged 55 to 69 years should be an individual one — and it recommends against PSA screening for men 70 and older. \"Many men will experience potential harms of screening, including false-positive results that require additional testing and possible prostate biopsy; overdiagnosis and overtreatment; and treatment complications, such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction,\" the task force'srecommendation summary notes. \"Clinicians should not screen men who do not express a preference for screening.\" Prostate cancer is common, second only to skin cancer as the most common cancer affecting males, according to theCleveland Clinic. According to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, for every 100 males, 13 will develop prostate cancer at some point in their lives.

    "title": "Judge orders Trump administration to allow attorneys access to Venezuelan man in Salvadoran prison",
    "article_text": "A federal judge in Texas ordered the Trump administration Monday to facilitate contact between aVenezuelan man deported to El Salvadorand his lawyers, giving the federal government until Wednesday afternoon. It’s the first such order in the mounting legal saga surrounding President Donald Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport hundreds of men to asupermax prison in El Salvador notorious for human rights abuses. TheTerrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT,generally offers zero contact between inmates and the outside world, including their lawyers and families. The order by Judge Keith P. Ellison of the Southern District of Texas gives the government 24 hours to confirm the location of the plaintiff — a 24-year-old Venezuelan man — and 48 hours to “restore and help maintain attorney-client communication” with him. “This shows that the court is as concerned as we are as to the whereabouts of this individual and the illegal justification for his continued detention,” said Javier Rivera, the Houston lawyer representing Widmer Josneyder Agelviz Sanguino, the incarcerated Venezuelan man. The Trump administration is expected to appeal the order to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The federal government has been ordered before, including by the Supreme Court, tofacilitate the return to the United States of people deported to El Salvador, most notablyKilmar Abrego Garcia, and has argued in response that it has no jurisdiction or ability to do so. Until now, it has not been ordered to facilitate contact between inmates and their lawyers. Agelviz initially traveled to the United States in September with his mother and two younger brothers as part of the U.S.’ refugee resettlement program, a process that involves extensive vetting and background checks. When they arrived at the airport in Houston, immigration agents detained Agelviz. Documents reviewed by NBC News show that Agelviz wasdetained because of a tattooon his forearm that includes a clock and a rose, images a Customs and Border Protection agent wrote are “associated” withthe Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. The documents show that he had no criminal record and that there was no additional evidence linking him to the gang. “My son is not a gang member,” said Agelviz’s mother, Lisbeth Carolina Sanguino, who is now living in San Antonio with her two other sons. “He’s a young man who’s never hurt anyone.” Sanguino hired a lawyer to prove her son’s innocence in immigration court. But only two weeks before the immigration court case was set to be resolved, Agelviz and hundreds of other men from Venezuela were shipped with no warning or court hearings to El Salvador. Attorneys for the men argue that their sudden deportations violated their due process rights, an issue now at the center of legal challenges to return them to the United States and prevent further similar deportations. Advocates and lawyers representing the men in CECOT have found that a majority of them had no criminal records. Many also did not violate any immigration laws when they came to the United States,according to a recent analysis by the Cato Institute, often crossing the U.S.-Mexico border with appointments through the CBP One app. But at least three, including Agelviz, came to the United States under the refugee resettlement program, according to Michelle Brané, executive director of Together and Free, a nonprofit group assisting more than a hundred families of deported Venezuelans. Applicants for refugee status go through months of vetting conducted at the migrants’ locations abroad, not at the border, including extensive background checks by both U.S. and international law enforcement agencies to ensure they do not pose public safety threats to the United States. “Refugees are always very carefully screened before they are admitted into the United States,” Brané said. “It seems particularly unlikely that they would have made it through that entire process and really have some serious indication of being such a dangerous criminal.” In a statement, a White House official said: “DHS intelligence assessments go well beyond just gang affiliate tattoos and social media. Tren De Aragua is one of the most violent and ruthless terrorist gangs on planet earth. They rape, maim, and murder for sport. President Trump and Secretary Noem will not allow criminal gangs to terrorize American citizens.” The statement did not offer any additional evidence linking any of the refugees deported to CECOT to Tren de Aragua or to criminal activity of any kind. However, the official added: “We are confident in our law enforcement’s intelligence, and we aren’t going to share intelligence reports and undermine national security every time a gang member denies he is one. That would be insane.” The Department of Homeland Security document explaining the reasons for Agelviz’s detention indicates that he had no criminal record or incriminating information in his social media. It lists no evidence of gang affiliation beyond his tattoos. Those tattoos, Sanguino said, are references to her son’s childhood: his grandmother’s rose garden and an owl that visited their home every night at 3 a.m., which is the time shown on the clock. “I never approved of the tattoos,” Sanguino said. “But he asked me so much that when he turned 18, I finally said, ‘Go ahead, but I don’t want to see them.’” Agelviz also tattooed his mother’s name and his brothers’ initials on his arm. “He thought because he got my name tattooed that I wouldn’t get mad at him,” she said. Her two younger sons do not have tattoos. The family were living in Ecuador when they applied for refugee status and went through the screening process, which lasted around 10 months and involved several in-person interviews during which Agelviz was asked about his tattoos. They had fled Venezuela for reasons they asked not to divulge to protect family members still at risk. The refugee program is reserved for people fleeing armed conflict and targeted persecution; it is rarely granted to Venezuelans or other migrants from the Americas, and it is typically associated with people fleeing war in the Middle East and Africa. Like all loved ones of men deported to CECOT, Sanguino has had no contact with her son for more than two months. “It’s very difficult for me as a mother to have to imagine the situation my son is in without being able to do anything about it, without knowing how he is,” she said. “How is his health, how is he eating, what is going through his mind?” The first and only glimpse at the conditions under which the men are being held came last week, when former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., as part of his show on One America News,accompanied a congressional delegation to the wing of CECOT holding Venezuelan deportees. (No other media outlets have been allowed access to that wing of the facility.) The prisoners there repeatedly shouted “Liberty!” and made theinternational hand signal for help. Watching the video, Sanguino said, only made things harder. “I eat and I feel guilty, because I don’t know what he’s eating, or if he’s eating,” Sanguino said. She often wakes up anxious thinking of him. “And I want to think that it’s a nightmare but feel sad every time I remember that it’s reality.”",

    "title": "What downgrade? U.S. stocks and borrowing costs stay largely flat after Moody's action",
    "article_text": "Investors largely shrugged off a downgrade of the U.S.' credit rating in Monday trading, as stocks ended the day mostly flat. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added more than 130 points for an increase of 0.32%. The broader S&P closed up 0.09% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.02%. Late Friday, Moody’s became the third and final major ratings agency to downgrade U.S. debt,reducing it by one notch from AAA to Aa1. Credit ratings agencies help determine how reliably a country can pay off its debt. Yet the market for U.S. government debt has so far remained mostly stable. As of 4 p.m., the yield on the 10-year Treasury note — the government’s benchmark loan asset — was only a few percentage points above where it traded Friday, climbing to 4.46%. That remans well below the most recent high of 4.59% briefly seen last month. “The downgrade itself doesn’t seem so far to have made much of a market splash,” analysts at the Capital Economics research consultancy wrote in a note. While the government’s debt yield — or the percentage return demanded by investors for lending to it —  briefly climbed Monday, the analysts said, “the moves haven’t been enormous.” They noted similar market reactions to the prior U.S. credit downgrades, which occurred in 2011 and 2023. While stock and bond buyers went largely unscathed Monday, home buyers now face higher mortgage costs as a result of the downgrade. The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed-rate loan hit as much as 7.04% on Monday, according to Mortgage News Daily. That was the highest level since April 11. “The average mortgage lender had to account not only for the market movement in Friday’s closing minutes, but also to the additional weakness seen this morning. That makes for a fairly big jump, day-over-day, but it does very little to change the bigger picture,” Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily,said according to CNBC. In remarks accompanying its downgrade, Moody’s said America’s ability to control its balance sheet has eroded over the years, something that has forced yields higher. “Successive U.S. administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,” it said. “We do not believe that material multi-year reductions in mandatory spending and deficits will result from current fiscal proposals under consideration.” But while Friday's downgrade garnered international headlines, individual stock buyers continue to prop up the market, helping to counterbalance the declines. These \"retail\" buyers, who are largely individual investors as opposed to larger firms like pension funds or hedge funds, have fueled the broader market recovery since President Donald Trump's shock \"Liberation Day\" tariffs announcement sent stocks tumbling. A popular investment instrument from Vanguard that has become a proxy for retail buying was flat Monday, suggesting there remained little appetite among retail traders for selling. The U.S. is by no means out of the woods. In the first place, the prior years' downgrades have done little to alter America's fiscal trajectory. Meanwhile, third-party budget experts like theCongressional Budget Officeand thePenn Wharton Budget Modelsay the spending bill sought by Trump now working its way through Congress would likely fail to address the U.S.'  predicament. As stocks wavered, one of the most prominent voices on Wall Street warned they are likely to go lower.According to CNBC, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon told investors Monday that he believes the odds of stagflation in the U.S. economy, which he described as \"basically a recession with inflation,” are roughly double what the market thinks — a scenario Dimon said will cause corporate earnings to decline. But in a call with reporters Monday, the White House dismissed concerns about the deficit, saying they fail to account for how much growth it says Trump's economic policies could generate and neglect what it says are ongoing government spending cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency and revenue streams from tariffs. Others remain unconvinced by that rosy picture. \"In the short run, the U.S. is still the world’s reserve currency and store of wealth,\" Mike Goosay, chief investment officer and global head of fixed income at Principal Asset Management financial group, wrote in a note to clients. \"But the bigger issue is long-term,\" he continued. \"If global investors start to question the U.S. role in the global order, that’s when we could see real consequences.\"",

    "title": "'Mr. Combs' kingdom': Former personal assistant testifies Diddy controlled his ex Cassie Ventura",
    "article_text": "This is a free article forDiddy on Trialnewsletter subscribers.Sign upto get exclusive reporting and analysis throughout Sean Combs’ federal trial. Federal prosecutors pressed forward in Diddy’s sex trafficking trial today by callingthree witnesses who testifiedabout how the music mogul appeared to control his longtime girlfriend, R&B singer and modelCasandra Ventura. As the government’s key witness, Venturatestified in unsparing detail last weekabout sexual encounters with paid male escorts that she said Diddy forced her to endure under physical and psychological abuse. With today’s witnesses, the government tried to bolster its allegations. The last witness of the day,David James, a personal assistant who worked for Diddy from 2007 to 2009, sobbed on the stand as he recounted interviewing for his job: There was a picture of Diddy on the wall, James said, and he was told, “This is Mr. Combs’ kingdom, and we are all here to serve in it.” Diddy’s team brought the heat in today’s line of questioning of Richard, appearing to poke holes in her testimony. It was the first time we’ve seen a very aggressive cross-examination from the defense. Defense lawyerNicole Westmorelandhad multiple mic-drop moments when she used Richard’s own words against her and suggested inconsistencies in what Richard recalled about an alleged incident in 2009, when, she said, Diddy attacked Ventura with a skillet of eggs. On Friday, Richard testified that Diddy tried to hit Ventura with the skillet, differing from a previous statement in which Richard said he did hit her and another time when she said Diddy threw eggs before he set the pan down. On redirect, Richard told prosecutorMitzi Steinerthat she tried “to erase those things from my memory” but that “every day, I remember certain things.” In other news:Before the jury was brought in for Richard’s testimony,U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanianquestioned the value of some of what may be shared on the stand. Testimony that relies on hearsay, he warned, “strikes me as a case built on gossip.” Marc Agnifilo, one of Diddy’s lawyers, responded that he’s worried that the testimony is being prejudicial to his client. “I think this is becoming sort of a bad act free-for-all,” he said. James testified today that he suggested to Ventura that she leave the “party life” with Diddy and that Ventura told him she depended on Diddy for her career, her home and her salary. That may sound like a “coercive” environment. And “coercion” is a necessary element for the sex trafficking charge. But is this the kind of “coercion” envisioned by the sex trafficking law? Sex trafficking under the law with which Diddy is charged includes the use “of force, threats of force, fraud, coercion ... or any combination of such means” “to cause [a] person to engage in a commercial sex act.” The act defines “coercion” as “threats of serious harm to or physical restraint against any person” or “any scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause a person to believe that failure to perform an act would result in serious harm to or physical restraint against any person.” There’s no question Diddy physically abused Ventura. We have seen as much in the infamous hotel beating video. Her testimony about being harmed and restrained would most likely satisfy the “coercion” element. But would depending on Diddy for her career, her home and her salary be “coercion” for sex trafficking purposes? Probably not. The government will surely clarify this in its closing argument: that jurors should focus on the violent coercion and not be thrown by the defense’s likely argument that mere dependency isn’t enough — because it isn’t. James returns to the stand tomorrow. Other expected witnesses in the coming days includeSharay Hayes, an exotic dancer;Regina Ventura, Cassie Ventura’s mother; andJourdan Atkinson, a former personal chef for Diddy. PSA: Every night during Diddy’s trial, NBC’s “Dateline” will drop special episodes of the “True Crime Weekly” podcast to get you up to speed on the case. “Dateline” correspondentAndrea Canningchats with NBC News’Chloe Melasand special guests — right in front of the courthouse.Listen here.",

    "article_text": "\"Love Island\" contestant Cashel Barnett is accused of assaulting his ex in front of their child and was being held without bail in a Utah jail Monday. The district attorney in Salt Lake County filed charges against Barnett, 34, on May 12 that include felony aggravated assault, felony domestic violence in the presence of a child and two counts of misdemeanor assault. A lawyer for Barnett said Barnett turned himself in Monday morning and is awaiting a bail hearing scheduled for Thursday. \"We are obviously in the very early stages here and won't have any comment until after that hearing,\" Andrew K. Deesing said by email. Salt Lake City police said the mother of the pair's 1-year-old child reported an incident, which she said happened April 10, on April 24. She told police that when she tried to calm Barnett during an argument in front of the child, he slapped her arms and picked her up by her neck using both hands before he slammed her onto a bed, the police report says. The report alleges that Barnett allegedly throttled the woman with \"continuous pressure\" and that the woman \"was unable to breathe and her vision went blurry.\" \"Barnett then slapped [the woman] in the face and said, 'You’re fine,'\" the police report says. The woman told police she experienced \"difficulty breathing, a raspy voice, coughing, trouble swallowing, neck pain, nausea, vomiting, agitation, amnesia, memory loss, visual changes, and headache,\" according to the police report. It does not mention whether she sought medical attention. The warrant request warns that the woman is at high risk for homicide and says she told authorities that Barnett had previously threatened to kill her, the report says. Court recordsconfirm he was not in custody for days following approval of the May 12 warrant request. Barnett, who is based in Salt Lake City-based, appeared on the first season of \"Love Island\" in 2019. According to his social media accounts and websites, he now plays the drums in multiple bands, works as a model and sells custom birthday and greetings videos for prices that start at $25.",

    "title": "Biden’s prostate cancer diagnosis is unusual but not unheard of, doctors say",
    "article_text": "Details released so far aboutformer President Joe Biden’s prostate cancer diagnosissuggest his case is uncommon but not unheard of, according to doctors who treat the disease. Biden, 82, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer on Friday, following the discovery of a nodule on his prostate, his personal office said in a statement. The cancer has spread to the bone, his office said, but seems likely to respond to treatment. Most cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed at an early stage, often with the help of routine screenings involving blood tests or rectal exams. But inaround 8% of cases, the cancer has already metastasized — or spread to other organs — by the time it’s diagnosed. At that point, the patient has likely had prostate cancer for several years to a decade, multiple oncologists said. In Biden’s case, “we definitely would anticipate that he has had prostate cancer for many, many years,” said Dr. William Dahut, chief scientific officer for the American Cancer Society. There are exceptions, however. “Most prostate cancers are slow-growing, but some people can develop a high-risk cancer that happens relatively quickly and can spread quickly,” said Dr. Alon Weizer, a urologist and chief medical officer of Mount Sinai Medical Center. “Is that super common? No. But it can occur and it all depends on the underlying biology of that individual cancer.” Though screenings can help with early detection, medical professionals don’t always agree on who should get screened for prostate cancer. Many doctors do not screen men in their late 70s or 80s, since those individuals are likely to die of another medical condition before they die of prostate cancer. But as people continue to live longer, some doctors feel that screenings are appropriate for older men in good health. TheAmerican Cancer Society recommendsthat men in their 50s and 60s get screened every two years. Men whose blood tests show elevated levels of prostate-specific antigen, a protein produced by the prostate gland, should get annual screenings, according to the ACS. And men with a higher risk of prostate cancer, such as African Americans or those with a family history of the disease, should start screenings in their 40s. But thecurrent guidelinesfrom the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force — an independent panel of experts whose recommendations often determine whether screenings are covered by insurance — say that men ages 55 to 69 should merely discuss getting a blood test with their physician. The task force is weighing new guidelines for prostate cancer screenings, with many doctors calling for a more expansive and emphatic recommendation. Weizer said doctors used to screen more widely for prostate cancer in the late 1980s and early 1990s, which led to diagnosing and treating cases that might not have otherwise impacted a person’s life. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force from 2012 to 2018 recommended against blood tests that helped identify prostate cancer, which led to a drop-off in screenings. “Prostate cancer is an unusual type of cancer in the sense that we now know there’s a lot of prostate cancers that will never cause a problem in a person,” Weizer said. “So you don’t really even want to find those cancers. You want to find the ones that are going to behave more aggressively.” In recent years, he said, the pendulum has swung back in the direction of more screenings, as doctors have gotten better at knowing which cases to treat and which to monitor over time. But Dahut said there’s still some lingering concerns among patients and physicians that the benefits of screening don’t outweigh the risks of overdiagnosis or overtreatment. Screening rates havesteadily declined since 2012— which Dahut said has contributed, in part, to a 5% annual increase inmen being diagnosed with more advanced prostate cancer. It’s unclear whether Biden has been screened for prostate cancer in recent years. Hisannual physical examin February 2024 did not indicate that a screening had taken place, though it would not have been expected for his age. According to his physical exam from 2019, he had an enlarged prostate, but had not been diagnosed with prostate cancer by that point. Dr. David Shusterman, a New York-based urologist, said Biden’s advanced diagnosis would be considered unusual for someone who was screened regularly. “It’s rare to present with bone [metastasis] … in someone who’s checking with their urologist once a year,” he said. “I’ve been doing this 25 years and I’ve never had a patient like that.” The diagnosis is more common in patients who don’t regularly see a doctor, he added. That was the case with Rick Gum, who had never been screened before he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2018. Gum, the 73-year-old owner of a trucking company in Big Rock, Illinois, originally sought care for a hernia, only to learn he had aggressive cancer that had spread to his bones. “I learned the hard way,” he said. “I should have been going to the doctor.” Gum said his cancer was too far progressed to receive standard treatments, so he participated in various clinical trials at Northwestern Medicine involving chemotherapy, radiation and a pharmaceutical drug containing radioactive isotopes. “I’ve had seven good years since they diagnosed me,” he said. “They’ve been quality years. I ride motorcycles. We travel some. I love my job. I’ve been able to do it all.” Around37% of patients whose prostate cancer has metastasizedsurvive at least five years after their diagnosis, according to the American Cancer Society. Dr. Peter Nelson, vice president of precision oncology at Fred Hutch Cancer Center, said patients like Biden have a more than 90% chance of responding to therapies that lower testosterone — a hormone that can feed the cancer’s growth. These so-called hormone therapies often come in the form of an injection or pill. “Most likely, he will get multiple medications at the initiation of his therapy, and could expect several years of response to that therapy before that cancer becomes resistant,” Nelson said. Some patients receive chemotherapy or radiation at the same time or following hormone therapy, he added. Biden and his family areconsidering “multiple treatment options,”including hormone therapy,according to a sourcefamiliar with the family’s thinking.",

    "title": "Bombing at IVF clinic should be a security wake-up call for fertility centers, experts say",
    "article_text": "A bombing this weekend at a fertility clinic in Californiais raising fears that the threat of violence that has long loomed over abortion providers is now extending to other areas of reproductive health. Authorities said four people were injured when a car bomb exploded outside the American Reproductive Centers clinic in Palm Springs Saturday, and the 25-year-old suspect was killed. The facility was badly damaged in the blast. Law enforcement officials said the suspect’s writings expressed anti-natalist views, a belief that procreation is morally wrong. They characterized the blast as anact of terrorismand said it was believed to bean isolated incident. But security experts and women’s health advocates said the violence should serve as a wake-up call for all fertility facilities, especially as reproductive issues — not just abortion — have become increasingly politicized. Several high-profile fertility clinics across the country declined to comment for this article out of fear that publicly discussing security concerns could draw unnecessary attention or increase their vulnerability to copycat attacks. Philip Klein, a security consultant and president of Texas-based Klein Investigations, said Monday he was fielding calls from clients at multiple reproductive health sites who have asked for advice following the attack. “Everybody’s a little bit nervous right now,” he said. “What I am deathly scared about is that we may see this escalate.” While abortion clinics have faced safety threats for decades, fertility clinics have generally been insulated. But in recent years, particularly since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, in vitro fertilization — an assisted reproductive technology that tens of thousands of patients use to start families every year — has drawn scrutiny, too, with embryos a new target, in part from antiabortion organizations that believe embryos should have the same legal rights as people. Last year, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos created through IVF wereconsidered children under state law, a decision that exposed families and clinics to potential criminal charges or damages. In response, the state’s largest hospital and at least two other providers paused IVF treatments. The issue made national news and became a major talking point in the 2024 presidential election, with Democrats seizing on the potential for more fallout. The state later passed a bill granting immunity, civil and criminal, for providers and patients. Eric Sean Clay, former president of the International Association for Healthcare Security and Safety, a professional safety guideline organization, said he was confident other fertility clinics would seek to bolster their protections after the attack in California, even if they hadn’t considered extra precautions before. “When we think of this level of violence, we think about abortion clinics. We don’t think about IVF clinics,” he said. “When they see that there’s a potential vulnerability or threat, they move very quickly to try to address it.” He advised clinics to take a holistic approach to security: forging relationships with local law enforcement agencies, securing the exteriors of their buildings with buzzer access, installing fences around the facilities, prohibiting overnight parking and ensuring there is adequate lighting in the clinics, among other measures. Klein said that, aside from increasing security, enforcing basic rules is helpful. “I know it’s so cliché: If you see something, say something. Have eyes in your building,” he said. Saturday’s bombing has cast a dark shadow on not just providers but also those who seek out fertility treatments, said Barbara Collura, president and CEO of Resolve, a national infertility advocacy group. She said the violence has added an extra emotional burden that families dealing with infertility already face. She said in a statement to NBC News that it was “deeply distressing members of our community, many of whom are navigating complex treatment regimens to try to build their families.” Her organization was also contacting clinics to gauge how they plan to ensure the continued safety of patients and the embryos they entrust with their fertility doctors. While violence at fertility clinics is unusual, attacks on abortion clinics and providers are becoming alarmingly common. Of the more than 1,600 death threats or threats of harm since 1977, nearly 300 occurred in 2023 and 2024,according to the National Abortion Federation, which monitors incidents of harassment against abortion providers. And those opposed to abortion often take issue with other reproductive rights, too, said Melissa Fowler, chief program officer and head of the security team at the National Abortion Federation. “We know that opposition to abortion is not just about abortion,” she said, adding that she was worried that other reproductive health sites could face increased threats. She said IVF clinics could learn from abortion providers who consider security at every stage, from selecting locations for their clinics where patients can walk in without intimidation and harassment to installing bulletproof glass and regularly training employees on how to respond to threats. “Given this incident and given the environment that we’re in, I think there’s a lot that people can learn from abortion providers, and people should be doing everything they can to think about safety in a proactive way,” she said. “It’s really unfortunate and unacceptable that we even have to have this conversation.”",

    "title": "Trump allies shift from well-wishes to suggesting Biden hid his cancer diagnosis",
    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — An initial wave of bipartisan sympathy for Joe Biden’s cancer diagnosis has started to ebb, giving way to suggestions from Donald Trump’s allies that the former president’s inner circle masked his condition while he was in office to create an illusion that he was still up to the job. In a social media post Sunday showing a picture of Biden with the caption, “Politics aside, we wish him a speedy recovery,” the president’s eldest son, Don Trump Jr., wrote, “Agreed 100%.” Come Monday, he posted adarker message: “Everyone was in on the coverup! Who was running the country? We need accountability!” President Trump and his MAGA movement have long charged that Biden was too enfeebled to serve and that a coterie of loyalists propped him up to hide the harsh reality from voters, an accusation his team has denied. The revelation Sunday that Biden, 82, is suffering from anaggressive formof prostate cancer has rekindled the old accusations at an especially inopportune time for his inner circle and Democrats more broadly. Fresh reportingsuggests that Biden’s decline was more pronounced than previously known and that protective advisers misled the public about his health. The alarming news of Biden’s illness, coupled with the damage to Biden world’s credibility when it comes to his fitness, are the tinder for unfounded speculation that he knew he was sick and concealed it until he left office. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Trump said, “I think it’s very sad, actually. I’m surprised that ... the public wasn’t notified a long time ago because to get to stage nine [the stage of disease that Biden faces is] that's a long time.\" He added that “somebody is not telling the facts. … It’s a big problem.” Vice President JD Vance told reporters on Monday that he hoped Biden “makes the right recovery.” But Vance then pivoted to Trump world’s familiar talking point: “We really do need to be honest about whether the former president was capable of doing the job.” Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla.,called the timing of Biden’s announcement“interesting,”suggesting it was an attempt to “distract the American people” from a tough news cycle. Former Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., who ran against Biden in the 2024 Democratic primary, also suggested that the former president held off in revealing his diagnosis for strategic reasons, looking to blunt the latest round of attacks on his competence. “I don’t think it’s coincidental that this was announced this week,”Phillips told The New York Times. “It’s hard to comport otherwise.” Biden hasn’t revealed much about the diagnosis, apart from a social media post on X thanking people for their “love and support.” His office released a statement saying the cancer had spread beyond the prostate, but that the illness could be managed through treatment. As president, Biden received regular physicals attesting to his health and was under constant watch from the White House medical team. Given the care and attention he received, the advanced state of the illness left some medical experts surprised. Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist who served on the Biden transition’s Covid advisory board, said onMSNBC’s “Morning Joe” Monday that the cancer had likely been “growing there and spreading” for years. “It’s a little surprising to many of us oncologists that he wasn’t diagnosed earlier,” said Emanuel, who was not part of Biden’s personal medical team. One former Biden aide, who requested anonymity to speak candidly, said the ex-president would be better served if he answered a few pressing questions: Why was the cancer detected late, did doctors test for it earlier and what are Biden’s prospects for recovery? “Last week, President Joe Biden was seen for a new finding of a prostate nodule after experiencing increasing urinary symptoms,” a statement from Biden’s personal office said. “On Friday, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone. While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management. The President and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.” A Biden spokesperson on Monday said there was no additional information outside of Sunday’s announcement. Several doctors who haven’t treated Biden told NBC News that the diagnosis wouldn’t have affected Biden’s ability to serve as president. “Prostate cancer is something that a lot of men live with for years,” said Dr. Jesse Mills, the director of the Men’s Clinic at UCLA Health. “In no way would this have any impact on his ability to govern, even if he were still president today.” Dr. Michael Stifleman, the director of urologic oncology for Hackensack Meridian Health in New Jersey, said that Biden’s cancer diagnosis is “completely separate to any other issues [related to] his competency.” “I think the prostate cancer should not affect him cognitively,” he added. Dr. Herbert Lepor, a urologic oncologist at NYU Grossman School of Medicine in New York, said that while there are many factors at play, most men in the early stages of advanced treatment are fully functional in every capacity. Though Biden’s political career is done, his party could pay a price in future elections if Republicans can make stick the accusation that Democrats at the highest levels knew Biden was seriously ill and covered it up. Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, a former White House physician and Trump loyalist,posted on Xthat he wished Biden well and suggested, without evidence, that Biden’s doctor may have purposely hid information. “Unbelievable this was missed, but the truth is, his physician was more concerned about assisting with the political coverup than providing world class medical care.” Some of Biden’s detractors point to a public appearance in 2022 in which he mentioned that he had cancer, portraying it as a clue that explains his current illness. Yet at the time, a White House spokesperson clarified that Biden was referring toskin cancerthat had been removed before he took office. Steve Schale, who headed a super PAC backing Biden in 2020, rejected Republican suggestions that Biden’s latest disclosure was part of some sort of conspiracy. “People can talk about the other stuff all they want, but I don’t know that the two things have any connection whatsoever at all,” Schale said. “Just because Republicans say it does, doesn’t mean it’s actually a thing.” When asked about how Biden has handled the release of public information around his prostate cancer diagnosis, Schale pointed to other past presidents who have dealt with health challenges. “I mean, he’s not the president anymore. He isn’t required to share any more than he wants,” Schale said. “I have no reason to think that he didn’t just find out about this and that they’re trying to work through it.”",

Send your questions topoliticsnewsletter@nbcuni.comand we may answer them in a future edition of the newsletter. It’s a huge week for House Republicans as they seek to pass a massive bill for President Donald Trump’s agenda through their narrow majority along party lines, as various factions of holdouts continue to demand changes. GOP leaderscleared an important hurdlelate Sunday night, when four conservative hard-liners on the House Budget Committee relented and allowed the bill to advance after blocking it two days earlier. Now the package goes to the Rules Committee, where party leaders want to make changes and meet Wednesday at 1 a.m. ET to send it to the floor. And Trump is getting involved in the final push ahead of Speaker Mike Johnson’s Memorial Day deadline: He’s expected to join aHouse Republican conference meetingTuesday morning. Medicaid cuts and limits:Conservatives have complained about provisions in the bill that front-load benefits and delay the spending cuts. That includes cuts to Medicaid — in the form of stricter work requirements that were slated to begin in 2029, among other things. To appease right-wing holdouts, that date will move to the beginning of 2027, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said Monday on CNBC. But would that cost votes among more moderate Republicans? Scalise didn’t make any guarantees that they’d stay on board, saying only that leadership is “talking to all those members” about it, and that “everybody knew this was something that we were working on.” It will be a difficult balance to strike as swing-district Republicans are already facing political attacks over the Medicaid cuts. Clean energy cuts:There’s a similar dilemma on clean energy funding cuts. The legislation repeals major pieces of the Inflation Reduction Act, which Democrats passed in 2022 along party lines, that provide funding and tax credits to promote clean energy But conservatives want to be more aggressive in rolling back the money, in part to reduce the added red ink under the bill. The problem is a lot of the funds benefit red and purple districts represented by Republicans. And politically endangered members don’t like taking funds away. GOP leaders need to find a way to placate both those factions. SALT deduction:The state and local tax deduction has become perhaps the biggest nuisance for party leaders. It is a unique problem because a group of blue-state Republicans have insisted on a significant expansion of the SALT deduction of $10,000 per tax filer, which the party instituted in 2017. Top Republicans have offered to raise it to $30,000, but that’s still not enough for a handful of members who have made it a red line to win their support for the bill. Raising the deduction is expensive, and risks alienating not just ultra-conservative members but other center-right Republicans in districts where SALT isn’t a big issue. Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y., the loudest GOP voice advocating a bigger SALT deduction, has even suggestedraising marginal tax rateson the wealthy in order to help finance it. That idea is strongly opposed by many in the party. President Donald Trump has taken some Cabinet members and senior administration officials and layered on additional work that calls for wholly different sets of skills. The dual postings give rise to a tangle of managerial challenges, constitutional questions and potential conflicts of interest, critics contend. Jamieson Greer:As U.S. trade representative, Greer has been flying around the world to negotiate with countries over the tariffs that the president imposed. On top of that, he is the government’s official watchdog. The White House has appointed Greer both acting director of the Office of Government Ethics and acting head of the Office of Special Counsel. Daniel Driscoll:He is not only secretary of the Army, but the acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The first job is about keeping soldiers in fighting trim; the second includes cracking down on contraband cigarettes. Marco Rubio:His titles include secretary of state, national security adviser and acting head of the National Archives and Records Administration. He is also the acting administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development — or what’s left of it after the Trump administration effectively dismantled it. Todd Blanche:In addition to being deputy attorney general, Trump recently named Blanche as the acting head of the Library of Congress. The Justice Department upholds the nation’s laws and advances Trump’s agenda; the library is supposed to give lawmakers independent research they request.

    "title": "Mortgage rates cross back over 7% after U.S. credit downgrade",
    "article_text": "After several weeks of sitting stagnant, mortgage rates surged higher Monday following Moody’s decision todowngrade the U.S. credit rating. Bond yields roseafter the late Friday announcement, and mortgage rates loosely follow the yield on the 10-year Treasury. The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed loan hit 7.04% on Monday, according to Mortgage News Daily. That is the highest level since April 11. “The average mortgage lender had to account not only for the market movement in Friday’s closing minutes, but also to the additional weakness seen this morning. That makes for a fairly big jump, day-over-day, but it does very little to change the bigger picture,” said Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily. The April surge in mortgage rates did have a direct effect on the housing market, causing it to pull back right in the heart of the usually busy spring season. Pending sales of existing homes in April, counted by signed contracts, dropped 3.2% compared with April of last year, according to Realtor.com. Homebuilders also noted a steep drop in demand in April. Homebuilder sentiment is now at the lowest level since the end of 2023, according to the National Association of Home Builders’ monthly index. There was a bit of a comeback in mortgage demand from homebuyers in the first two weeks of May, according to a weekly index from the Mortgage Bankers Association, but that was when rates were just sitting right around 6.9%. There has been a marked slowdown among buyers recently, whenever the rate goes over that 7% threshold. In addition, any rate increase will knock some people out of even qualifying for a mortgage.",

    "article_text": "Deepa Shivaram President Trump boards Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on May 12, 2025.Brendan Smialowski/AFPhide caption The luxury Boeing 747gifted to the U.S. government by Qataris standing by at the San Antonio, Texas, airport, awaiting a specialized overhaul from a defense contractor so that President Trump can use it as the next Air Force One. It's not clear how quickly the plane — which touched off a firestorm ofethical, legal, political and security concerns just ahead of Trump's trip to the Middle East last week — will be ready to take the skies with Trump aboard. The Air Force will take ownership of the plane once the paperwork to pass it over is complete, and then the retrofit can begin, according to a U.S. official, who was not authorized to speak to reporters on the record. The Air Force did not comment publicly on the plans, and the White House earlier Monday deferred all questions to the Air Force. \"The president, frankly, has nothing to do with it,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday. President Trump and Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani at the start of a state dinner at the Lusail Palace in Doha on May 14, 2025.Brendan Smialowski/AFPhide caption Qatar's offer of the $400 million plane came to light as Trump was leaving for a trip that took him to Doha as well as stops in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. On that trip, Trump said Qatar intends to spend more than $1 trillion on business deals with the United States, including a big order of Boeing jets from Qatar Airways. The White House said the plane was a gift to the Department of Defense, and would go through the legal protocols required when something is given to the government. Trump said he would not use the plane after he leaves office — though he wants to park it in his presidential library one day. \"I appreciate it very much. I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer,\" Trump said. President Trump speaks to reporters in the press cabin of Air Force One as he departs Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, on May 16, 2025.Win McNamee/Getty Images Europehide caption But experts say outfitting a plane like this to make it suitable for use as the presidential aircraft normally would entail at least a few years of work, stripping the plane down and adding what's necessary to make it safe enough to carry the president. That timeline means it may not be ready until Trump is out of office. Shortcuts in the retrofit could create national security risks, experts said. \"They wouldn't be able to install the kinds of capabilities you typically find on an Air Force One,\" saidRichard Aboulafia, managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory, describing a retrofit timeline of less than four years. \"In terms of encrypted communications, to electronic warfare, to back-up power systems — it wouldn't have any of that in that time frame,\" Aboulafia said. \"Anybody on that jet would be advised to use burner phones and watch what they say.\" Nicholas Veronico, a former NASA contractor who worked on 747s and is an author of a book on Air Force One, agreed that a shorter timeframe would be problematic. \"If the conversion can be done within a year and President Trump is flying around the world in this new less-than-Air-Force-One Air Force One, then he's flying in a compromised airplane. And we're putting our president at risk,\" Veronico said. Members of Congress have also sounded the alarm, including some of Trump's Republican allies. \"I prefer a big, beautiful plane built in the United States, made in America, bought in America,\" saidSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer has proposed banning the Air Force from retrofitting foreign planes as presidential aircraft. Trump has bristled at the criticism, saying it wouldn't make sense to turn down the gift. \"Why should our military, and therefore our taxpayers, be forced to pay hundreds of millions of Dollars when they can get it for FREE from a country that wants to reward us for a job well done. This big savings will be spent, instead, to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!,\" Trumpsaid on social media. \"Only a FOOL would not accept this gift on behalf of our Country.\" NPR'sTom BowmanandDeirdre Walshcontributed to this report.

    "title": "For the first time, the U.S. is absent from WHO's annual assembly. What's the impact?",
    "article_text": "By Jonathan Lambert World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus addresses the World Health Assembly on May 19. It's the first such gathering that the U.S. has not attended in nearly 80 years in the wake of President Trump's plan to withdraw from WHO membership.Fabrice Coffrini//AFP via Getty Images/AFPhide caption It's the biggest global health meeting of the year. And the United States won't be taking a seat at the table. This week, representatives from the 194 countries of the World Health Organization — minus the U.S. — are gathering in Geneva to discuss and vote on policies that will shape global health in the years and decades to come. The topics will range from preparing for the next pandemic to preventing lung cancer by cutting air pollution. So where's the U.S.? On Inauguration Day, President Donald Trump announcedplans to withdrawfrom the WHO, saying that the U.N. organization had \"ripped\" off the United States and asserting that it is controlled by China. For the first time since 1948, the U.S. — which provides about one-fifth of WHO's $6.8 billion budget — will be absent from the annual World Health Assembly. \"It's very sad that the U.S. is no longer within the group of countries who want to help make the world a better place,\" saidBarbara Stocking of Britain, the chair of the Panel for a Global Public Health Convention, an independent group focused on pandemic prevention. That glaring absence of both people and money will affect both WHO's ability to address health crises that don't care about borders -– as well as the ability of the U.S. to collaborate with the rest of the world to solve them, say global health specialists interviewed by NPR. But the Assembly also comes at a time of opportunity. After years oftough negotiations, member nations are poised to adopt the pandemic treaty, an agreement aimed at ensuring the globe responds to the next pandemic better than COVID-19. \"This coming World Health Assembly will be historic,\" saidLawrence Gostin, a professor at Georgetown University and Director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law. \"In one way it'll be triumphant,\" he said, referencing the pandemic treaty. \"And in another way, it'll be tragic … because the United States won't be there.\" Here's what to watch for at this year's World Health Assembly: How WHO will address its funding crisis; whether WHO adopts the pandemic treaty and what health goals will be set without a U.S. voice As the biggest financial contributor to WHO, the U.S. has historically played an outsized role in negotiations. \"When the United States wanted something, it could lead and influence like no other country, including our rivals, like China or Russia,\" said Gostin. \"The U.S. won't be there to have that kind of influence now and for the foreseeable future. To me, that's terribly sad.\" What emerges in that vacuum of US leadership is still unclear. \"What is lacking now for WHO is not just the budget,\" saidChristoph Benn, director of Global Health Diplomacy at the Joep Lange Institute in Amsterdam. \"The U.S. has some of the most sophisticated systems of health expertise in the world. Some of the best experts always come from the U.S., and I can honestly say they will be sorely missed.\" But discussion and negotiations will continue. Given the political climate in the U.S., some suspect their absence could galvanize the meeting. \"I think there are a lot of countries who feel like they can exhale in our absence and focus on the work and not have conversations mired in political debates,\" said a former U.S. health official who has been a delegate at previous assemblies but requested anonymity for fear of retaliation from the Trump administration. For instance, some pandemic treaty watchers suspect the Trump administration's abrupt withdrawal spurred countries to finalize the agreement ahead of the World Health Assembly. Whether that productive dynamic continues remains to be seen. \"I'll be paying attention to who emerges as not just leaders, but maybe as partners and collaborators,\" said the official. \"There's a constant question of who takes over now. maybe it's not going to be China, maybe it's going to be the Global South working together to solve problems.\" NPR reached out to the White House for comment on the upcoming meeting but did not receive a response. WHO faces the most significant budget crisis in its nearly 80-year history. They're already short $600 million for the 2024-2025 $6.8 billion budget and face even more drastic shortfalls over the next couple years because of the Trump administration's decision to terminate U.S. membership. The U.S. exit \"left a big hole in the budget of WHO that other smaller contributions from other countries from around the world could not compensate for,\" said Benn. Already, WHO has cut its proposed budget for 2026-2027 by about 20% to compensate. \"To be blunt, we cannot do everything,\" said WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at abudget committee meetinglast week, noting that WHO has started cutting positions, including about half of the leadership team, and will be scaling back programs around the world. \"What the world will notice most dramatically are the cuts in the emergency programs,\" said Benn, which he says enable countries to respond quickly to outbreaks, likempoxorEbola, and quickly relay that information to WHO. \"If those country programs have to be cut down, it's a big loss.\" But WHO is working to diversify its cash flow. The organization is funded through a mix of mandatory contributions — member states contribute based on the size of their economy — and voluntary contributions. Voluntary contributions can come from member countries, and philanthropic donors – led by the Gates Foundation (which is a funder of NPR and this blog). \"The share of the mandatory contributions [in the total budget] has been historically very low, not more than 20 to 25%, meaning the rest of the budget are voluntary contributions,\" said Benn. WHO is trying to change that. This week, member states will vote on upping mandatory contributions to 30%, said Benn. Even still, WHO could be short over $1 billion for its next budget, and it's not just because of the U.S. withdrawal. Many other countries are tightening their belts in the face of global economic uncertainty. As a result, \"WHO is also appealing to the private sector and private foundations to increase their contributions,\" said Benn. \"I've attended probably 25 World Health Assemblies in my lifetime,\" said Benn. \"I do anticipate that the mood this time will be very much downcast. I think it will be palpable that there is a sense of crisis here.\" After more thanthree years of negotiations, the 193 member countries of the WHO — but not the U.S. — are expected to adopt thePandemic Prevention, Preparedness and Response Agreement, which would obligate countries to cooperate to prevent and respond to any future pandemic. But the treaty is not without its controversies, some of which remain to be sorted out. The agreement is \"one of the direct learnings from COVID-19,\"Maria Van Kerkhove, interim director of the Department of Epidemic and Pandemic Preparedness and Prevention at WHO, told NPR Friday in an interview. \"To not only just say that the world wants to do better, but actually take concrete steps to do so.\" The30-page treatycovers a wide range of topics, from paying closer attention to the risk of viruses spilling over from animals to protecting health care workers. But years of tough negotiations have whittled down the initial ambition and scope of the agreement. \"People might look at the accord and say the language is imperfect and of course it's not perfect,\" said Van Kerhove. \"But there's so much to work with in what's actually drafted there.\" Even if countries adopt the agreement, there are unresolved details around the most contentious issue — rich countries sharing vaccine and treatment technology in exchange for outbreak data from low- and middle-income countries. The agreement attempted to formalize this exchange through the Pathogen Access and Benefit-Sharing System. \"I call it a kind of grand social global bargain,\" said Gostin. \"High-income countries would gain access to critical health information and scientific exchange like pathogen samples, genomic sequencing data that we need to develop the lifesaving vaccines and treatments,\" he said. \"In return, we would agree to equitably distribute those medical products throughout the world, through WHO.\" That grand bargain proved contentious. Some richer countries balk at the prospect of constraining their pharmaceutical industries, while lower-income countries protest the idea of sharing the data needed to design treatments and vaccines without some guarantee that they'll benefit. For now, countries have agreed to come to \"mutually agreed terms\" on this issue over the next year. Whatever ends up being decided, the U.S. won't be part of it. \"It's hard for me to see how the U.S. gets unimpeded, rapid access to the kinds of scientific information we need to rapidly develop our vaccines and treatments,\" said Gostin. \"That could be a problem for every American.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Federal judge blocks Trump's takeover of U.S. Institute of Peace",
    "article_text": "Ryan Lucas A view of the United States Institute of Peace (USIP) building headquarters on March 18 in Washington, D.C.Anna Moneymaker/Getty Imageshide caption A federal judge on Monday blocked the Trump administration'stakeover of the United States Institute of Peace, saying the president exceeded his authority when he fired the board members and moved to dismantle the organization and its operations. U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell ruled the USIP president and board members wereunlawfully fired by President Trump and should be reinstated. In her 102-page ruling, Howell also declared that the transfers of the institute's assets, including its headquarters, seized in the administration's takeover are null and void. Trump's move against USIP, Howell wrote, \"represented a gross usurpation of power and a way of conducting government affairs that unnecessarily traumatized the committed leadership and employees of USIP, who deserved better.\" Earlier this year, Trump fired the institute's board members and president and ordered the institute's operations be gutted, saying it fell under executive branch purview. A team from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency then forcefully seized the institute's headquarters and moved to dismantle operations. Five members of the board sued to try to block the takeover. Their lawsuit alleges that they were unlawfully removed from their positions and should be reinstated. After Howell's ruling was announced, more than 20 former USIP employees gathered outside the institute's headquarters building in Washington, D.C. to celebrate. \"Incredulous, so excited, just crying for joy,\" said Tonis Montes, who was a senior program officer for the nonviolent action team. The staff were fired in March and lost access to their email and all of their work. Several seemed hopeful that they could eventually get back into the building, which remains shuttered. \"If Americans believe in peace and security, they should believe in the United States Institute of Peace,\" said Nicoletta Barbera, an expert on Africa. \"We support American values abroad, which are a belief that peace is cheaper than wars and more effective than fighting.\" Another of her colleagues, Mary Holmcrams, said that this was a case about government overreach, as the Trump administration tried to take over a nonprofit and fire the board. She hopes this will be a precedent for other targets of DOGE. The Department of Justice didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the ruling. The case before Howell revolved in large part around the question of whether USIP is part of the federal government, and if so, whether it's part of the executive branch. In their filings and in court, the fired board members have argued that USIP is not part of the federal government. The Trump administration, in contrast, has argued that the institute is part of government and falls under the executive branch, giving Trump the authority to remove the board. In her ruling, Howell said USIP \"is unique in its structure and function — neither a traditional executive branch agency nor an entirely private nonprofit corporation.\" Ultimately, Howell concluded that USIP must be considered part of the federal government but that it is not part of the executive branch. \"Instead, USIP supports both the Executive and Legislative branches as an independent think tank that carries out its own international peace research, education and training, and information services,\" she wrote. Because of that, Trump's firing of the USIP board members was unlawful, and the actions that have occurred since then to gut USIP to its \"statutory minimums,\" remove its president, terminate the staff and transfer the institute's property to the General Services Administration are unlawful as well. The acting president of USIP, former diplomat George Moose, said \"we are delighted\" with the ruling. \"We feel that it affirms what we have been saying all along, that Congress was very intentional about the way it went about setting up USIP, about it being an entity that is independent of the executive branch of government, and that its ability to do its work successfully depends on that independence,\" Moose said. The government can appeal Howell's ruling, which would affect what happens next. Moose acknowledged that it will take time to get USIP back up and running even if the government doesn't appeal.

    "article_text": "Ruth Sherlock Pope Leo XIV with Vice President JD Vance, his wife Usha Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his wife Jeanette Dousdebes Rubio, on the occasion of their meeting at the Vatican, Monday.Simone Risoluti/Vatican Media via APhide caption ROME — At a meeting between Vice President JD Vance and Pope Leo XIV at the Vatican on Monday, the vice president presented the first U.S. pontiff — a Chicago native — with a Chicago Bears jersey, with \"Pope Leo XIV\" emblazoned in white and orange letters on the back. \"Good choice,\" the poperesponded.This first formal meeting appeared part of an effort by Washington to reset relations with the Vatican, after Leo's predecessor Pope Francis repeatedly criticized President Trump's migration policy. Now the diplomatic efforts to bring a negotiated ceasefire to Ukraine may provide an opportunity for common ground. In these first days of his papacy, Leo has already called for an \"authentic and lasting peace\"in Ukraine. President Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday, as part of what he has called an attempt to stop the \"bloodbath\" of the war in Ukraine. Joining Vance, who converted to Roman Catholicism in 2019, at Monday's Vatican meeting with Pope Leo were Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is also Catholic, and the two U.S. officials' wives. Vance delivered a letter from the president and first lady inviting the pope to visit the White House, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Monday. The Vatican did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment about the invitation. After the papal audience, Vance met with officials at the Vatican's Secretariat of State, the Church's top diplomatic office. A Vatican readout called those talks \"cordial.\" \"There was an exchange of views on some current international issues, calling for respect for humanitarian law and international law in areas of conflict and for a negotiated solution between the parties involved,\" it said. Before his rise to the papacy, Cardinal Robert Prevost appeared to have shared news articles via an account on the social media platform X that were critical of the Trump administration's plans for mass deportations of migrants. The Vatican has not commented on whether the posts were authentic. The account has since been removed. Last week, in his first address to world diplomats as pontiff, Pope Leo said the dignity of migrants had to be respected. The late Pope Francis made immigrants and the poor a central focus of his papacy. He called Trump's plan to deport millions of migrants a \"disgrace.\" And in early 2016, he famously declared Trump — then a Republican candidate for president — \"not Christian\" for his pledge to prevent people from crossing illegally into the United States by building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Francis also rebuked Vance for calling on Christians to prioritize love for their families and countrymen over strangers and foreigners. \"Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extends to other persons and groups,\"Francis wrote in a letter to U.S. bishops after Vance's remarks. \"The true ordo amoris that must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the 'Good Samaritan,' that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception.\" Vance met with Pope Francis the day before he died. Both he and Rubio attended the inaugural Mass for Pope Leo on Sunday. At Vance's meeting on Monday, he gave Leo two works by St. Augustine,The City of GodandOn Christian Doctrine, the vice president's office said. Leo is thefirst Augustinian pope. Leo gave Vance a coffee-table sized picture book about the papal apartments in the Apostolic Palace and a bronze sculpture bearing a message in Italian,La pace è un fiore fragile,\"Peace is a fragile flower.\" The Vatican has long offered to try to helpfacilitate talksbetween Ukraine and Russia, but had become largely sidelined in the negotiations around Ukraine-Russia war, with comments by Pope Francis upsetting both sides at different points in the conflict. The Vatican has continued to seek to help facilitate the return of Ukrainian children taken by Russia and the Holy See has been able to mediatesome prisoner exchanges. On Saturday, Rubio said the Vatican could be a good venue for Russia-Ukraine peace talks. Asked if the Vatican could be a peace broker, Rubio replied: \"I wouldn't call it broker, but it's certainly — I think it's a place that both sides would be comfortable going.\" He then met with Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, the Vatican point man on Ukraine, to further discuss ways, Rubio said, that the Vatican could help \"the path forward\" in Ukraine.

    "article_text": "By Joe Hernandez Police tape is seen outside the American Reproductive Centers fertility clinic in Palm Springs, which was damaged in a bombing on Saturday.Gabriel Osorio/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption An explosion outside a Palm Springs, Calif.,fertility clinic late Saturday morningkilled one person, injured four others and sent debris flying for blocks in all directions in the city about 100 miles east of Los Angeles. The prime suspect in the bombing is also who authorities believe was the sole fatality in the blast: Guy Edward Bartkus. The 25-year-old California resident held nihilistic views and may have also had antinatalist leanings, the FBI said. Investigators say the clinic was targeted and are treating the bombing as an intentional act of domestic terrorism. Here's what we know so far. First responders arrived at the scene of an explosion on North Indian Canyon Drive in Palm Springs around 11 a.m. local time, finding a debris field 250 yards in size. Palm Springs Police Chief Andrew Mills said police and firefighters encountered a \"massive crime scene\" with \"blocks of debris.\" Investigators said the size of the blast eclipsed that of thedeadly 2018 bombingat an Aliso Viejo spa. \"This was probably the largest bombing scene that we've had in Southern California,\" said Akil Davis, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles Field Office. The bomb was large and powerful enough to \"throw pieces of vehicle hundreds of feet in the air and then several blocks away,\" Davis added. He declined to comment on the type of materials used in the bomb, citing the ongoing investigation. Investigators document the scene outside the damaged Palm Springs fertility clinic that was targeted in a bombing Saturday morning.David McNew/Getty Imageshide caption Those injured by the blast were all released from the hospital and medical care as of late Sunday morning, authorities said. The blast cut through the American Reproductive Centers (ARC) fertility clinic, which has been operating in Palm Springs since 2006, according to its website. It provides in vitro fertilization and other reproductive services. The clinicposted a photoon Instagram of its badly damaged facade, with building materials and glass strewn across the road and black smoke and flames billowing from inside. ARC confirmed that a vehicle exploded in its parking lot, but said no staff members were hurt and that there was no damage to its eggs, embryos and other reproductive materials. \"Our mission has always been to help build families, and in times like these, we are reminded of just how fragile and precious life is,\" the clinic wrote. In a news conference on Sunday, Davis of the FBI thanked the Palm Springs police and fire departments as well as FBI bomb technicians for working quickly to ensure that none of the embryos at the facility were lost. On Sunday, the FBI identified its prime suspect in the bombing as Bartkus, who lived in Twentynine Palms, a town about 60 miles northeast of Palm Springs. Investigators said they had earlier executed a search warrant there. Officials were \"fairly confident\" that the deceased person found near the vehicle was Bartkus, Davis said, adding that Bartkus had been driving a silver 2010 Ford Fusion sedan. Two bomb squad officers walk near near the scene of the blast in Palm Springs, Calif.Gabriel Osorio/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption Investigators said they were combing through online posts and other writings made by Bartkus. \"The subject had nihilistic ideations, and this was a targeted attack against the IVF facility,\" Davis said Sunday. Nihilism is a philosophy that rejects values and beliefs and views existence as useless. FBI spokesperson Laura Eimiller also confirmed that the agency was scrutinizing evidence \"indicating antinatalist views,\" which refers to an ideology that proposes it's wrong to have children. According to LAist, Bartkus posted writings and an audio recording about the attack online, which surfaced in the aftermath of the weekend bombing. He described himself as a \"misandrist\" and \"promortalist,\" a reference to the belief that it is ethical to end suffering by ending lives, the website reported. \"Basically I'm anti-life,\" Bartkus said in the recording. \"And IVF is like kind of the epitome of pro-life ideology.\" NPR has not independently verified this audio. Davis said investigators believe Barktus was trying to livestream the bombing. The 25-year-old had not previously appeared on the FBI's radar but may have had encounters with other law enforcement agencies, Davis added. Health care advocacy groups — particularly those working in reproductive medicine — spoke out against the bombing and warned about threats faced by medical providers. Clinics and doctors who provide abortions and other reproductive health care haveexperienced violent attacksfor many years. More recently some IVF facilities havebeen the target of protests. The American Society for Reproductive Medicinesaid in a statementthat it was \"appalled and deeply disturbed\" by the Saturday morning bombing. \"Sadly, those of us working in reproductive medicine are no strangers to these threats,\" the group said. \"We have seen physicians murdered, facilities attacked, and patients being harassed, threatened, and harmed. We must not allow such violence to extend into the realm of fertility care.\" Barbara Collura, president and CEO of RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association, said she was \"heartbroken\" to learn that the bomber targeted a fertility clinic. \"Those in the family building community, and the dedicated healthcare professionals who serve them, deserve to receive and provide care in peace and safety,\" Collurasaid in a statement. \"Experiencing infertility and going through the IVF process are challenging experiences for anyone to face. It is imperative that those who need access to IVF medical treatment, no matter where they live, can access that care without fear.\" The head of the nonprofit Center for Reproductive Rights, Nancy Northup,called the attack\"unconscionable\" and said the \"history of violence against reproductive health centers is why clinics need protections and patients must feel safe.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Biotech company Regeneron to buy bankrupt 23andMe for $256M",
    "article_text": "Regeneron will use trove of 23andMe genetic data to develop medical advances. Biotechnology company Regeneron will acquire 23andMe out of bankruptcy for $256 million, with a plan to keep the DNA-testing company running without interruption and uphold its privacy protection promises. Inits announcement of the acquisition, Regeneron assured 23andMe's 15 million customers that their data—including genetic and health information, genealogy, and other sensitive personal information—would be safe and in good hands. Regeneron aims to use the large trove of genetic data to further its own work using genetics to develop medical advances—something 23andMe tried and failed to do. \"As a world leader in human genetics, Regeneron Genetics Center is committed to and has a proven track record of safeguarding the genetic data of people across the globe, and, with their consent, using this data to pursue discoveries that benefit science and society,\" Aris Baras, senior vice president and head of the Regeneron Genetics Center, said in a statement. \"We assure 23andMe customers that we are committed to protecting the 23andMe dataset with our high standards of data privacy, security, and ethical oversight and will advance its full potential to improve human health.\" Baras said that Regeneron's Genetic Center already has its own genetic dataset from nearly 3 million people. The safety of 23andMe's dataset has drawn considerable concern among consumers, lawmakers, and regulators amid the company's downfall. For instance, in March, California Attorney General Rob Bonta made the unusual move to urge Californians todelete their genetic data amid 23andMe's financial distress.Federal Trade Commission ChairmanAndrew Ferguson also weighed in, making clear ina March letterthat \"any purchaser should expressly agree to be bound by and adhere to the terms of 23andMe’s privacy policies and applicable law.\" 23andMe said it was \"pleased\" with the sale to Regeneron and \"grateful\" that 23andMe employees will stay employed. The acquisition \"enables the mission of 23andMe to live on, while maintaining critical protections around customer privacy, choice, and consent with respect to their genetic data,” Mark Jensen, chair and member of the special committee of the board of directors of 23andMe, said ina separate announcement. The sale, carried out through a bankruptcy auction, is expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter, pending approval by the US Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. If the sale is approved, a court-appointed, independent consumer privacy ombudsman will ensure that data privacy protections are honored. Regeneron was one of seven bidders for 23andMe, according tosecurities filings. Sold for $256 million, 23andMe has fallen far from its heyday. The plucky Silicon Valley startup, founded in 2006 and known for selling direct-to-consumer genetic tests, hit a peak valuation of $6 billion in the fall of 2021 after the company went public. But 23andMe struggled with its business model, which relied on a \"one-and-done\" product. As a publicly traded company, it has never turned a profit, and side ventures to expand its business into health care and the biotech industries failed. In September,all seven of 23andMe's independent directors resigneddue to disagreement with CEO Anne Wojcicki over the \"strategic direction\" of the company. In March, Wojcicki stepped down andthe company filed for bankruptcy. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Space Force official: Commercial satellites can do a lot more than we thought",
    "article_text": "\"They could shave off about a third of the time and over half the cost.\" A generation ago, when former NASA administrator Dan Goldin promoted the mantra of a\"faster, better, cheaper\"approach to the agency's science missions, critics often joked that NASA could only pick two. That's no longer the case. NASA is finding success in its partnerships with commercial space companies, especially SpaceX, with lower costs, quicker results, and improved performance. The Space Force and the National Reconnaissance Office, the US government's spy satellite agency, are also capitalizing on new products and services from commercial industry. In many cases, these new capabilities come from venture-backed startups already developing and operating satellites for commercial use. The idea is to focus the Space Force and the NRO on missions that only they can do, according to Chris Scolese, director of the NRO. Military and intelligence agencies are already buying launch services, communications services, and satellite surveillance imagery on a commercial basis. These missions also have commercial applications, so the government is purchasing products and services with rockets and satellites that already exist. Now, the military is starting to use a commercial model for missions that, at least today, lack any meaningful commercial market. In these cases, the Space Force and the NRO must go out and pay a company to build an entire fleet of satellites that will exclusively serve the government. But rather than dictating stringent requirements and micromanaging every phase of the program, as the Space Force and NRO have typically done, they're going with a more hands-off approach. This change in procurement strategy is yielding results, officials said last week in a hearing convened by the House Armed Services Committee. Numerous companies are now manufacturing satellite buses, the basic chassis that hosts instruments, sensors, and payloads tailored for a range of missions. Most of them come from SpaceX, which mass-produces satellites for its Starlink broadband network. But there are others, and the market is richer than many US officials thought. \"We're finding that commercial buses are not only available, but they're also capable of doing a lot of what our missions require, and they're available at a much lower cost than going off and developing a brand new bus,\" Scolese said. The Space Force and the NRO kicked off several initiatives over the last few years to look at ways to exploit these commercial technologies. Some of these programs are already producing results. The Space Force's Space Development Agency has launched the first 27 prototypes for a future network of hundreds of satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO) to detect and monitor missile launches, and relay tracking data to the ground. The National Reconnaissance Office, which owns the government's spy satellites, awarded contracts in 2022 worth $4 billion to buy commercial imagery from three companies—newcomers BlackSky, Planet, and incumbent provider Maxar—with their privately owned spacecraft. The NRO also started launching its own fleet of commercially built spy satellites last year tomore rapidly gather imageryof places around the world. Nearly 200 of these satellites, based on SpaceX's Starlink design, have launched in the last year. Most recently, the Space Force rejigged how it plans to buy a series of new space surveillance satellites for the Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program, or GSSAP. These satellites are designed to fly near and inspect other objects near geosynchronous orbit, a ring around the equator more than 22,000 miles (nearly 36,000 kilometers) above Earth. In that orbit, a spacecraft moves in synchronicity with Earth's rotation, giving satellites a constant view of the same region of the planet. This makes geosynchronous orbit a popular location for satellites designed for communications, early-warning, and eavesdropping missions. The Space Force has launched six GSSAP satellites built by Northrop Grumman, one of America's largest traditional defense contractors. Five of them are still operational, and the military wants to buy more. But this time, the Space Force will procure the satellites through a commercial arrangement. Instead of dictating stringent requirements to contractors and purchasing the satellites outright, the Space Force will levy fewer requirements and select a commercial company to develop the next generation of GSSAP satellites. Last year, the Pentagon canvassed the commercial satellite industry to see what might be available. Military officials soon hit a roadblock. The Space Force—and particularly US Space Command—closely guards details of the GSSAP program. The program's most exquisite capabilities are classified, and the Space Force defined requirements for the next-generation GSSAP satellites that would be subject to similar levels of secrecy. Leaders at Space Command, which actually uses the GSSAP satellites, agreed to relax their requirements, according to Maj. Gen. Stephen Purdy, acting assistant secretary of theAir Force for space acquisition and integration. The decision allowed the Space Force to move forward with a commercial procurement strategy that Purdy said will cut the cost of the system in half and reduce its development timeline by a third. \"So, we're off working now with that program office to go start off a more commercial line,\" Purdy said. \"And when I say commercial in this particular aspect, just to clarify, this is accomplishing the same GSSAP mission. Our operators will fly the GSSAP system using the same ground systems and data they do now, but these would be using faster, commercial build times... and cheaper, less expensive parts in order to bring that together in a faster sense.\" The next-gen GSSAP spacecraft may not meet the same standards as the Space Force's existing inspector satellites, but the change comes with benefits beyond lower costs and faster timelines. It will be unclassified and will be open to multiple vendors to build and launch space surveillance satellites, injecting some level of competition into the program. It will also be eligible for sales to other countries. There's another area where Purdy said the Space Force was surprised by what commercial satellite builders were offering. Last year, the Pentagon used a new \"Quick Start\" procurement model authorized by Congress to establish a program to bolster the GPS navigation network, which is run by the Space Force but relied upon by commercial users and private citizens around the world. The Space Force has more than 30 GPS satellites in medium-Earth orbit (MEO) at an altitude of roughly 12,550 miles (20,200 kilometers). Purdy said the network is \"vulnerable\" because the constellation has a relatively small number of satellites, at least relative to the Space Force's newest programs. In MEO, the satellites are within range of direct ascent anti-satellite weapons. Many of the GPS satellites are aging, and the newer ones, built by Lockheed Martin, cost about $250 million apiece. With the Resilient GPS program, the Space Force aims to reduce the cost to $50 million to $80 million per satellite. The satellites will be smaller than the GPS satellites flying today and will transmit a core set of signals. \"We're looking to add more resiliency and more numbers,\" Purdy said. \"We actually didn't think that we were going to get much, to be honest with you, and it was a surprise to us, and a major learning [opportunity] for us, learning last year that satellite prices had—they were low in LEO already, but they were lowering in MEO,\" Purdy said. \"So, that convinced us that we should proceed with it. The results have actually been more surprising and encouraging than we thought. \"The [satellite] buses actually bring a higher power level than our current program of record does, which allows us to punch through jamming in a better sense. We can achieve better results, we think, over time, going after these commercial buses,\" Purdy said. \"So that's caused me to think, for our mainline GPS system, we’re actually looking at that for alternative ways to get after that.\" In September, the Space Force awarded four agreements to Astranis, Axient, L3Harris, and Sierra Space to produce design concepts for new Resilient GPS satellites. Astranis and Axient are relatively new to satellite manufacturing.Astranis is a pioneerin low-mass Internet satellites in geosynchronous orbit, and a non-traditional defense contractor. Axient, acquired by a company named Astrion last year, has focused on producing small CubeSats. The military will later select one or more of these companies to move forward with producing up to eight Resilient GPS satellites for launch as soon as 2028. Early planning is already underway for a follow-on set of Resilient GPS satellites with additional capabilities, according to the Space Force. The experience with the R-GPS program inspired the Space Force to look at other mission areas that might be well-served with a similar procurement approach. They settled on GSSAP as the next frontier. Scolese, director of the NRO, said his agency is examining how to use commercial satellite constellations for other purposes beyond Earth imaging. This might include a program to employ commercially procured satellites for signals intelligence (SIGINT) missions, he said. \"It's not just the commercial imagery,\" Scolese said. \"It's also commercial RF (Radio Frequency, or SIGINT) and newer phenomenologies as where we're working with that industry to go off and help advance those.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "article_text": "SAG-AFTRA claims Epic didn't negotiate video game AI voice replacement terms. On Monday, SAG-AFTRAfiledan unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board against Epic subsidiary Llama Productions forimplementingan AI-generated Darth Vader voice inFortniteon Friday without first notifying or bargaining with the union, as their contract requires. Llama Productions is the official signatory to SAG-AFTRA's collective bargaining agreement forFortnite, making it legally responsible for adhering to the union's terms regarding the employment of voice actors and other performers. \"We celebrate the right of our members and their estates to control the use of their digital replicas and welcome the use of new technologies,\" SAG-AFTRAstatedin a news release. \"However, we must protect our right to bargain terms and conditions around uses of voice that replace the work of our members, including those who previously did the work of matching Darth Vader's iconic rhythm and tone in video games.\" The union's complaint comes just days after the feature sparked a separate controversy when playersdiscoveredthat they could manipulate the AI into using profanity and inappropriate language until Epic quickly implemented a fix. The AI-controlled in-game character uses Google's Gemini 2.0 to generate dialogue and ElevenLabs' Flash v2.5 AI model trained on the voice of the late James Earl Jones to speak real-time responses to player questions. For voice actors who previously portrayed Darth Vader in video games, the Fortnite feature starkly illustrates how AI voice synthesis could reshape their profession. While James Earl Jones created the iconic voice for films,at least 54 voice actorshave performed as Vader in various media games over the years when Jones wasn't available—work that could vanish if AI replicas become the industry standard. SAG-AFTRA's labor complaint (which can be read onlinehere) doesn't focus on the AI feature's technical problems or on permission from the Jones estate, whichexplicitly authorizedthe use of a synthesized version of his voice for the character in Fortnite. The late actor, who died in 2024, hadsigned overhis Darth Vader voice rights before his death. Instead, the union's grievance centers on labor rights and collective bargaining. In the NLRB filing, SAG-AFTRA alleges that Llama Productions \"failed and refused to bargain in good faith with the union by making unilateral changes to terms and conditions of employment, without providing notice to the union or the opportunity to bargain, by utilizing AI-generated voices to replace bargaining unit work on the Interactive Program Fortnite.\" The action comes amid SAG-AFTRA'songoing interactive media strike, which began in July 2024 after negotiations with video game producers stalled primarily over AI protections. The strike continues, with more than 100 games signing interim agreements, while others, including those from major publishers like Epic, remain in dispute.

    "title": "Trump to sign law forcing platforms to remove revenge porn in 48 hours",
    "article_text": "Take It Down Act’s 48-hour timeline may be both too fast and too slow. After dragging its feet for years, America is finally taking its first big step toward shielding victims of non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII)—also known as revenge porn—from constantly being retraumatized online. On Monday afternoon, Donald Trump is scheduled to sign theTake It Down Actinto law. That means that within one year, every online platform will be required to remove both actual NCII and fake nudes generated by artificial intelligence within 48 hours of victims' reports or face steep penalties. Supporters have touted the 48-hour timeline as remarkably fast, empowering victims to promptly stop revenge porn from spreading widely online. The law's passing comes at a time when AI-generated revenge porn is increasingly harming a wider pool of victims—including some who may have never shared a compromising photo, like dozens of kids in middle and high schools nationwide. Acknowledging the substantial harm to kids already, the law includes steeper penalties for NCII targeting minor victims, a threat lawmakers hope will help minors get harmful images removed \"as soon as possible.\" Critics have attacked the 48-hour timeline, though,warningthat platforms will be rushed to remove NCII and likely censor a broader range of content online. Trump has claimed that he would use the law to censor content he doesn't like, and the law does not explicitly exempt encrypted messages. So, if platforms decide to break encryption to prevent the liability threat, that could possibly pave the way for officials to censor critics' private messages, critics fear. For these reasons, legal challenges are expected. Whether the Take It Down Act can survive a potential constitutional challenge or not, the 48-hour timeline may be deficient for other reasons, though, victim testimony suggests. Likely wearisome for victims, the law won't be widely enforced for about a year, while any revenge porn already online continues spreading. Perhaps most frustrating, once the law kicks in, victims will still need to police their own revenge porn online. And the 48-hour window leaves time for content to be downloaded and reposted, leaving them vulnerable on any unmonitored platforms. Some victims are already tired of fighting this fight. Last July, whenGoogle started downranking deepfake porn appsto make AI-generated NCII less discoverable, one deepfake victim, Sabrina Javellana,told The New York Timesthat she spent months reporting harmful content on various platforms online. And that didn’t stop the fake images from spreading. Joe Morelle, a Democratic US representative who has talked to victims of deepfake porn and sponsored laws to help them, agreed that \"these images live forever.\" \"It just never ends,\" Javellana said. \"I just have to accept it.\" Andrea Powell—director of Alecto AI, an app founded by a revenge porn survivor that helps victims remove NCII online—warned on a 2024 panel that Ars attended that requiring victims to track down \"their own imagery [and submit] multiple claims across different platforms [increases] their sense of isolation, shame, and fear.\" While the Take It Down Act seems flawed, passing a federal law imposing penalties for allowing deepfake porn posts could serve as a deterrent for bad actors or possibly spark a culture shift by making it clear that posting AI-generated NCII is harmful. Victims have long suggested that consistency is key to keeping revenge porn offline, and the Take It Down Act certainly offers that, creating a moderately delayed delete button on every major platform. Although it seems clear that the Take It Down Act will surely make it easier than ever to report NCII, whether the law will effectively reduce the spread of NCII online is an unknown and will likely hinge on the 48-hour timeline overcoming criticisms.

    "title": "Microsoft closes 9-year-old feature request, open-sources Windows Subsystem for Linux",
    "article_text": "WSL has also recently added official support for both Fedora and Arch distros. Microsoft's Windows Subsystem for Linux has become an important tool for developers and power users since it was introduced in the Windows 10 Anniversary Update back in 2016, giving them access to a built-in Linux command line and Linux applications from within Windows. The company hassteadily improved WSL since then, improving performance, making it easier to install and use, and adding features like GPU and audio support. But today as part of its Build developer conference, Microsoft announced that it would bemaking almost all of WSL open source, closingthe very first issuethat the then-new WSL project attracted on Github in 2016. \"WSL could never have been what it is today without its community,\" writes Microsoft Senior Software Engineer Pierre Boulay in the company's blog post. \"We’ve seen how much the community has contributed to WSL without access to the source code, and we can’t wait to see how WSL will evolve now that the community can make direct code contributions to the project.\" Only two elements of WSL remain closed-source for now: an lxcore.sys kernel driver used for WSL 1 (the initial version of WSL that is still supported, though new installs default to2019's WSL 2); and the p9rdr.sys and p9np.dll files that handle filesystem redirection from Windows to Linux (in other words, making it so that Windows can easily access the Linux filesystem). Microsoft didn't close the door to open-sourcing those components but also didn't say if or when it planned to make them open source. Though WSL uses some of the same technologies as virtual machines, WSL's speed, low resource usage, and integration with Windows makes it much more seamless to install and use than traditional virtual machines that maintain more separation between the host and guest operating system. Around the release of Windows 11 in 2021, Microsoft made WSL something that was installed and updated via the Microsoft Store rather than something built into the operating system, making it easier to add new features without requiring the potential disruption of a full Windows update (and also possibly making it easier to open source the code without posting source code for other parts of Windows). This isn't the only major improvement Microsoft has helped to release for WSL recently. Earlier this month, the companyannouncedthat Fedora is now an officially supported WSL distribution, joining Ubuntu (still the default) and a number of other distributions.Arch Linuxalso became an officially supported distribution back in April; both Fedora and Arch are taking advantage of changes Microsoft announced last year tomake it easier to build new WSL distributions. Windows users can install WSL bychoosing a distribution from the Microsoft Storeor by opening a command-line window and typingwsl --install. Users can install multiple distributions at once and switch between them based on what they're running or testing; typingwsl --list --onlineat the command line will also show you all of the distributions that Microsoft officially supports if you don't want to use Ubuntu.

    "title": "FCC Chair Brendan Carr is letting ISPs merge—as long as they end DEI programs",
    "article_text": "Verizon got FCC approval after ending DEI. Now Charter and Cox plan to merge. It's shaping up to be a big year for telecom mergers, and it appears the Federal Communications Commission is eager to approve the deals—as long as companies involved drop any DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) policies criticized by FCC Chairman Brendan Carr. Verizon just got a big merger approved, and cable giant Charter is seeking permission to buy Cox. The FCC on Friday announced approval of Verizon's purchase of Frontier, one day after Verizon committed to end DEI policies in afilingwith the commission. Carr previously sent letters to Verizon and other companies alleging that their diversity policies are \"invidious forms of discrimination\" that violate federal law andthreatenedto block mergers pursued by firms that enforce such policies. \"Verizon has now agreed to end its DEI policies as specified in a new FCC filing,\" Carrwrote in a post on X. \"These changes are effective immediately. A good step forward for equal opportunity, nondiscrimination, and the public interest.\" Verizon's commitment to end DEI policies is mentioned in theFCC press releaseannouncing approval of the merger and theFCC ordergranting the approval. The order issued by FCC staff said: We also recognize Verizon's commitment to equal opportunity employment and nondiscrimination as strengthening its investment and service quality efforts. Verizon states it is modifying its practices, including its leadership structure, training, corporate sponsorships, supplier selection, hiring, career development resources, and public and internal messaging, and has also committed to applying these changes to Frontier following the close of the proposed Transaction. We accept Verizon's commitment to modify its practices as firm and definite, and expect that these changes will prevent DEI discrimination in the post-transaction company, as consistent with the law and the public interest. Verizonannouncedits $20 billion deal for Frontier in September 2024, in the final months of the Biden administration. In last week's letter agreeing to end DEI practices, Verizon General Counsel Vandana Venkatesh wrote, \"we recognize that the regulatory and policy landscape surrounding diversity, equity, and inclusion ('DEI') has changed. The Supreme Court, the President's Executive Orders, and federal mandates require changes in the way companies approach DEI issues moving forward.\" Verizon's letter said that because of the \"changing landscape,\" the firm \"has been evaluating its DEI-related programs, HR processes, supplier programs, training programs and materials, and other initiatives.\" Among other changes, Verizon said it \"will no longer have a team or any individual roles focused on DEI\" and will reassign DEI-focused employees to \"HR talent objectives.\" \"Verizon recognizes that some DEI policies and practices could be associated with discrimination,\" the letter said. T-Mobile sent asimilar letterto Carr on March 27, saying it \"is fully committed to identifying and rooting out any policies and practices that enable such discrimination, whether in fulfillment of DEI or any other purpose,\" and is thus \"conducting a comprehensive review of its DEI policies, programs, and activities.\" One day later, the FCCapproveda T-Mobile joint venture toacquire fiber provider Lumos. With the Verizon and T-Mobile deals approved, Carr has another opportunity to make demands on a major telecom company. On Friday, Charter announced a$34.5 billion merger with Coxthat would make it the largest home Internet provider in the US, passing Comcast. SeveralCharter and Cox programscould be on the chopping block because of Carr's animosity toward diversity initiatives. Media advocacy group Free Press criticized Verizon for agreeing to Carr's demands. \"Verizon's cowardly decision to modify or kill its diversity, equity and inclusion practices is the latest shameful episode in a litany of surrenders to appease our authoritarian president,\" Free Press Vice President of Policy Matt Woodsaid. \"The government alleges no specific instances of unlawful employment discrimination, and Verizon admits none. Yet to win a merger approval and the prospect of a few extra dollars, the company meekly suggests that some of its 'DEI policies and practices could be associated with discrimination'—lawyer-speak for we've done nothing wrong, but we can see which way the political winds are blowing.\" Wood said that Carr \"once defended his agency's independence from the White House when a Democrat was in charge\" but is \"now gleefully carrying out the president's orders to roll back civil-rights protections and equal-opportunity gains at all costs.\" \"For no other reason than overt racism and fake grievances, we have an administration that falsely cloaks itself in free speech telling American businesses what they can and cannot say,\" Wood said. \"That's why Verizon explains in the letter the company's decision to remove all references to diversity, equity and inclusion in its public messaging.\" Consumer advocacy group Public Knowledgewarnedthat the Charter/Cox merger is likely to be \"weaponized\" by the Trump administration. \"However troubling as this merger might be for competition, at least as troubling is what the companies might agree to in order to persuade the Trump administration and the current FCC to approve the deal,\" Public Knowledge Legal Director John Bergmayer said. Bergmayer suggested that Charter and Cox might agree to \"drop cable channels critical of this administration, or agree to censor online content or sites that the administration disapproves of.\" He said the end of federal net neutrality rules makes the censoring of online content more likely. \"From walking back—even reversing—company policies designed to promote diversity and inclusion, to pulling back on news coverage critical of the administration, far too many companies have already put the short-term interest of currying favor with the White House over the public interest, and over the interests of their employees and the communities they serve,\" Bergmayer said. The FCC also has authority over media mergers when broadcast license transfers are involved. CBS owner Paramount, which is seeking approval for a merger with Skydance,decided to end numerous DEI policiesshortly after President Trump's second term began. Paramount is also facing a$20 billion lawsuit from Trumpand a \"news distortion\" investigationspearheaded by Carr's FCC, which are both related to the editing of a pre-election interview with Kamala Harris. Although anunedited transcript and camera feedsof the interview support CBS' defense that its editing was not deceptive, Carr has kept the investigation open while the FCC considers the Paramount/Skydance merger.

    "title": "F1 in Imola reminds us it’s about strategy as much as a fast car",
    "article_text": "Who went home happy from Imola and why? F1's title race heats up. Formula 1's busy 2025 schedule saw the sport return to its European heartland this past weekend. Italy has two races on the calendar this year, and this was the first, the (deep breath) \"Formula 1 AWS Gran Premio Del Made in Italy e Dell'Emilia-Romagna,\" which took place at the scenic and historic (another deep breath) Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari, better known as Imola. It's another of F1's old-school circuits where overtaking is far from easy, particularly when the grid is as closely matched as it is. But Sunday's race was no snoozer, and for a couple of teams, there was a welcome change in form. Red Bull was one. The team has looked a bit shambolic at times this season, with some wondering whether this change in form was the result ofa number of high-profile staff departurestoward the end of last season. Things looked pretty bleak during the first of three qualifying sessions, when Yuki Tsunoda got too aggressive with a curb and, rather than finding lap time, found himself in a violent crash that tore all four corners off the car and relegated him to starting the race last from the pit lane. 2025 has also been trying for Ferrari. Italy expects a lot from the red team, and the replacement of Mattia Binotto with Frédéric Vasseur as team principal was supposed to result in Maranello challenging for championships. Signing Lewis Hamilton, a bona fide superstar with seven titles already on his CV, hasn't exactly reduced the amount of pressure on Scuderia Ferrari, either. Lewis Hamilton was much closer to teammate Charles Leclerc this weekend, which will be encouraging to everyone. After Hamilton's exclusion fromthe Chinese Grand Prix, he has had to run a higher ride height, which has cost him speed relative to his younger teammate. Now it looks like he's getting a handle on the car and lost out to Leclerc by 0.06 seconds in Q1 and 0.16 seconds in Q2. Unfortunately, Leclerc's time was only good for 11th, and Hamilton's was only good for 12th. Sunday brought smiles for the Red Bull and Ferrari teams. In the hands of Verstappen, the Red Bull was about as fast as the black-and-orange McLarens, and while second was the best Verstappen could do in qualifying, the gap to McLaren's Oscar Piastri was measured in the hundredths of a second. Verstappen's initial start from the line looked unremarkable, too—the Mercedes of George Russell seemed more of a threat to the pole man. But Verstappen saw an opportunity and drove around the outside almost before Piastri even registered he was there, seizing the lead of the race. Once the Red Bull driver was in clean air, he was able to stretch the gap to Piastri. Getting past someone is notoriously hard at Imola. In a 2005 classic, Fernando Alonso held off Michael Schumacher's much faster car for the entire race. Even though the cars are larger and heavier now and more closely matched, overtaking was still possible, like Norris' pass on Russell. But when overtaking is as hard as it is at a track like Imola, teams will try to use strategy to pass each other with pit stops. Each driver has to make at least one pit stop, as drivers are required to use two different tire compounds during the race. But depending on other factors, like how much the tires degrade, a team might decide to do two or even three stops—the lap time lost in the pits by stopping more often can be less than the time lost running on worn-out rubber. In recent years, the word \"undercut\" has crept into F1 vocab, and no, it doesn't refer to the hairstyles favored by the more flamboyant drivers in the paddock. To undercut a rival means to make your pit stop before them and then, on fresh tires and with a clear track ahead, set fast lap after fast lap so that when your rival makes their stop, they emerge from the pits behind you. The undercut doesn't always work, but in Imola, it initially looked like it did. Charles Leclerc stopped on lap 10 and leapfrogged Russell's Mercedes, as well as his former Ferrari teammate and now Williams driver Carlos Sainz. Since Piastri wasn't closing on Verstappen up front, McLaren decided to bring him in for an early stop. But his advantage on new tires was not enough to eat into Verstappen's margin, and he did not emerge in clean air but rather had to overtake car after car on track as he sought to regain his position ahead of those who hadn't stopped. Sometimes, a strategy is the wrong one. McLaren's other driver, Lando Norris, couldn't make a dent on Red Bull's race, either. Having recognized the two-stop undercut wouldn't work, Norris had stayed out, but he was almost 10 seconds behind Verstappen when it was finally time to change tires on lap 29. Shortly afterward, Esteban Ocon pulled his Haas to the side of the track with a powertrain failure, triggering a virtual safety car. With all the cars required to drive around at a prescribed, reduced pace, Verstappen was able to take his pit stop while only losing half as much time as anyone who stopped under green flag conditions. Victory required a little more. Kimi Antonelli's Mercedes also ground to a halt in a position that required a full safety car. With some on fresh rubber and others not, there were battles aplenty, but Verstappen wasn't involved in any and won by seven seconds over Norris, with the recovering Piastri a few more seconds down the road. Meanwhile, Hamilton had been having a pretty good Sunday of his own. Although he started 12th, he finished fourth, to the delight of the partisan, flag-waving crowd. Some of that was thanks to Leclerc coming together with the Williams of Alex Albon; after that on-track scuffle was sorted, Albon lay fifth, with Leclerc at sixth. Albon was right to feel aggrieved that he lost fourth place but equalled his best finish of the year. Leclerc needed to cede the place to Albon, but at the same time, his complaint about the amount of rules-lawyering that now accompanies every bit of wheel-to-wheel action is getting a bit tedious. If F1 isn't careful, the rulebook will end up being too constraining, with drivers playing to the letter even if it's bad for the sport and the show. And sixth place was still a decent result from 11th; the championships already look out of reach for Ferrari for 2025, but at least it's in no danger of being overtaken by Williams in the tables, even if that is a threat on track. McLaren is already at 279 points in the constructors' championship, 132 points ahead of next-best Mercedes, so the constructors' cup is looking somewhat secure. Things are a lot closer in the drivers' standings, with Piastri on 146, Norris on 133, and Verstappen still entirely in the fight with 124 points. Next weekend, it's time for the Monaco Grand Prix.

    "title": "The making of Apple TV+’s Murderbot",
    "article_text": "Ars chats with series creators Paul and Chris Weitz about adapting Martha Wells' book series for TV. In the mood for a jauntily charming sci-fi comedy dripping with wry wit and an intriguing mystery? Check out Apple TV+'sMurderbot, based on Martha Wells' bestselling series of novelsThe Murderbot Diaries. It stars Alexander Skarsgård as the titular Murderbot, a rogue cyborg security (SEC) unit that gains autonomy and must learn to interact with humans while hiding its new capabilities. (Some minor spoilers below, but no major reveals.) There are seven books in Wells' series thus far. All are narrated by Murderbot, who is technically owned by a megacorporation but manages to hack and override its governor module. Rather than rising up and killing its former masters, Murderbot just goes about performing its security work, relieving the boredom by watching a lot of entertainment media; its favorite is a soap opera calledThe Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon. Murderbotthe TV series adapts the first book in the series,All Systems Red.Murderbot is on assignment on a distant planet, protecting a team of scientists who hail from a \"freehold.\" Mensah (Noma Dumezweni) is the team leader. The team also includes Bharadwaj (Tamara Podemski) and Gurathin (David Dastmalchian), who is an augmented human plugged into the same data feeds as Murderbot (processing at a much slower rate). Pin-Lee (Sabrina Wu) also serves as the team's legal counsel; they are in a relationship with Arada (Tattiawna Jones), eventually becoming a throuple with Ratthi (Akshay Khanna). As in the books, Murderbot is the central narrator, regaling us with his observations of the humans with their silly ways and discomfiting outbursts of emotion. Mensah and her fellow scientists were forced to rent a SEC unit to get the insurance they needed for their mission, and they opted for the cheaper, older model, unaware that it had free will. This turns out to be a good investment when Murderbot rescues Bharadwaj from being eaten by a giant alien worm monster—losing a chunk of its own torso in the process. However, it makes a tactical error when it shows its human-like face to Arada, who is paralyzed by shock and terror, making small talk to get everyone back to safety. This rouses Gurathin's suspicions, but the rest of the team can't help but view Murderbot differently—as a sentient being rather than a killing machine—much to Murderbot's dismay. Can it keep its free will a secret and avoid being melted down in acid while helping the scientists figure out why there are mysterious gaps in their survey maps? And will the scientists succeed in their attempts to \"humanize\" their SEC unit? The task of adapting Wells' novella for TV fell to sibling co-creators Paul Weitz (Little Fockers, Bel Canto) and Chris Weitz (The Golden Compass, Rogue One), whose shared credits includeAntz,American Pie, andAbout A Boy. (Wells herself was a consulting producer.) They've kept most of the storyline intact, fleshing out characters and punching up the humor a bit, even recreating campy scenes fromThe Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon—John Cho and Clark Gregg make cameos as the stars of that fictional show-within-a-show. Ars caught up with Paul and Chris Weitz to learn more about the making ofMurderbot. Ars Technica: What drew you to this project? Chris Weitz: It's a great central character, kind of a literary character that felt really rare and strong. The fact that we both liked the books equally was a big factor as well. Paul Weitz: The first book,All Systems Red, had a really beautiful ending. And it had a theme that personhood is irreducible. The idea that, even with this central character you think you get to know so well, you can't reduce it to ways that you think it's going to behave—and you shouldn't. The idea that other people exist and that they shouldn't be put into whatever box you want to put them into felt like something that was comforting to have in one's pocket. If you're going to spend so much time adapting something, it's really great if it's not only fun but is about something. It was very reassuring to be working with Martha Wells on it because she was very generous with her time. The novella's quite spare, so even though we didn't want to cut anything, we wanted to add some things. Why is Gurathin the way that he is? Why is he so suspicious of Murderbot? What is his personal story? And with Mensah, for instance, the idea that, yes, she's this incredibly worthy character who's taking on all this responsibility on her shoulders, but she also has panic attacks. That's something that's added, but we asked Martha, \"Is it OK if we make Mensah have some panic attacks?\" And she's like, \"Oh, that's interesting. I kind of like that idea.\" So that made it less alarming to adapt it. Ars Technica: You do play up the humorous aspects, but there is definitely humor in the books. Chris Weitz:A lot of great science fiction is very, very serious without much to laugh at. In Martha's world, not only is there a psychological realism in the sense that people can have PTSD when they are involved in violence, but also people have a sense of humor and funny things happen, which is inherently what happens when people get together. I was going to say it's a human comedy, but actually, Murderbot is not human—but still a person. Ars Technica: Murderbot's favorite soap opera,The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon, is merely mentioned in passing in the book, but you've fleshed it out as a show-within-the-show. Chris Weitz: We just take our more over-the-top instincts and throw it to that. Because it's not as though we think thatSanctuary Moonis bad. Ars Technica: As Murderbot says, it's quality entertainment! Chris Weitz: It's just a more unhinged form of storytelling. A lot of the stuff that the bot says inSanctuary Moonis just goofy lines that we could have given to Murderbot in a situation like that. So we're sort of delineating what the show isn't. At the same time, it's really fun to indulge your worst instincts, your most guilty pleasure kind of instincts. I think that was true for the actors who came to perform it as well. Paul Weitz: Weirdly, you can state some things that you wouldn't necessarily in a real show when DeWanda Wise's character, who's a navigation bot, says, \"I'm a navigation unit, not a sex bot.\" I'm sure there are many people who have felt like that. Also, to delineate it visually, the actors were in a gigantic stage with pre-made visuals around them, whereas most of the stuff [forMurderbot] was practical things that had been built. Ars Technica: In your series, Murderbot is basically a Ken doll with no genitals. The book only mentioned that Murderbot has no interest in sex. But the question of what's under the hood, so to speak, is an obvious one that one character in particular rather obsesses over. Chris Weitz: It's not really addressed in the book, but certainly, Murderbot, in this show as well, has absolutely no interest in romance or sex or love. This was a personable way to point it out. There was a question of, once you've got Alexander in this role, hasn't anybody noticed what it looks like? And also, the sort of exploitation that bot constructs are subjected to in this world that Martha has created meant that someone was probably going to treat it like an object at some point. Paul Weitz:I also think, both of us having kids, you get a little more exposed to ways of thinking that imply that the way that we were brought up thinking of romance and sexuality and gender is not all there is to it and that, possibly, in the future, it's not going to be so strange, this idea that one can be either asexual or— Chris Weitz: A-romantic. I think that Murderbot, among neurodivergent communities and a-romantic, asexual communities, it's a character that people feel they can identify with—even people who have social anxiety like myself or people who think that human beings can be annoying, which is pretty much everyone at some point or another. Ars Technica: It's interesting you mentioned neurodivergence. I would hesitate to draw a direct comparison because it's a huge spectrum, but there are elements of Murderbot that seem to echo autistic traits to some degree. Paul Weitz: People look at something like the autism spectrum, and they inadvertently erase the individuality of people who might be on that spectrum because everybody has a very particular experience of life. Martha Wells has been quoted as saying that in writing Murderbot, she realized that there are certain aspects of herself that might be neurodivergent. So that kind of gives one license to discuss the character in a certain way. Chris Weitz: I don't think it's a direct analogy in any way, but I can understand why people from various areas on the spectrum can identify with that. Paul Weitz:I think one thing that one can identify with is somebody telling you that you should not be the way you are, you should be a different way, and that's something that Murderbot doesn't like nor do. Ars Technica: You said earlier, it's not human, but a person. That's a very interesting delineation. What are your thoughts on the personhood of Murderbot? Chris Weitz: This is the contention that you can be a person without being a human. I think we're going to be grappling with this issue the moment that artificial general intelligence comes into being. I think that Martha, throughout the series, brings up different kinds of sentients and different kinds of personhood that aren't standard human issue. It's a really fascinating subject because it is our future in part, learning how to get along with intelligences that aren't human. Paul Weitz: There was a New York Times journalist a couple of years agowho intervieweda chatbot— Chris Weitz:It was Kevin Roose, and it was Sydney the Chatbot. [Editor: It was an AI chatbot added to Microsoft's Bing search engine, dubbed Sydney by Roose.] Paul Weitz: Right. During the course of the interview, the chatbot told the journalist to leave his wife and be with it, and that he was making a terrible mistake. The emotions were so all over the place and so specific and quirky and slightly scary, but also very, very recognizable. Shortly thereafter, Microsoft shut down the ability to talk with that chatbot. But I think that somewhere in our future, general intelligences are these sort of messy emotions and weird sort of unique personalities. And it does seem like something where we should entertain the thought that, yeah, we better treat everyone as a person. Ars Technica: There's this Renaissance concept calledsprezzatura—essentially making a difficult thing look easy. The series is so breezy and fun, the pacing is perfect, the finale is so moving. But I know it wasn't easy to pull that off. What were your biggest challenges in making it work? Chris Weitz: First, can I say that that is one of my favorite words in the world, and I think about it all the time. I remember trying to express this to people I've been working on movies with, a sense ofsprezzatura. It's like it is the duck's legs moving underneath the water. It was a good decision to make this a half-hour series so you didn't have a lot of meetings about what had just happened in the show inside of the show or figuring out why things were the way they were. We didn't have to pad things and stretch them out. It allowed us to feel like things were sort of tossed off. You can't toss off anything, really, in science fiction because there's going to be special effects, visual effects. You need really good teams that can roll with moving the camera in a natural way, reacting to the way that the characters are behaving in the environment. And they can fix things. Paul Weitz: They have your back. Chris Weitz: Yeah. Really great, hard work on behalf of a bunch of departments to make things feel like they're just sort of happening and we've got a camera on it, as opposed to being very carefully laid out. Paul Weitz: And a lot of it is trusting people and trusting their creativity, trying to create an environment where you've articulated what you're after, but you don't think their job is better than they do. You're giving notes, but people are having a sense of playfulness and fun as they're doing the visual effects, as they're coming up with the graphics, as they're acting, as they're doing pretty much anything. And creating a good vibe on the set. Because sometimes, the stress of making something sucks some of the joy out of it. The antidote to that is really to trust your collaborators. Ars Technica: So what was your favorite moment in the series? Paul Weitz: I'd say the 10th episode, for me, just because it's been a slow burn. There's been enough work put into the characters—for instance, David Dastmalchian's character—and we haven't played certain cards that we could have played, so there can be emotional import without telegraphing it too much. Our ending stays true to the book, and that's really beautiful. Chris Weitz: I can tell you my worst moment, which is the single worst weather day I've ever experienced in a quarry in Ontario where we had hail, rain, snow, and wind—so much so that our big, long camera crane just couldn't function. Some of the best moments were stuff that had nothing to do with visual effects or CGI—just moments of comedy in between the team members, that only exist within the context of the cast that we brought together. Paul Weitz: And the fact that they loved each other so much. They're very different people from each other, but they really did genuinely bond. Ars Technica: I'm going to boldly hope that there's going to be a second season because there are more novels to adapt. Are you already thinking about season two? Paul Weitz: We're trying not to think about that too much; we'd love it if there was. Chris Weitz:We're very jinxy about that kind of stuff. So we've thought in sort of general ways. There's some great locations and characters that start to get introduced [in later books], like Art, who's an AI ship. We're likely not to make it one season per book anymore; we'd do a mashup of the material that we have available to us. We're going to have to sit with Martha and figure out how that works if we are lucky enough to get renewed. New episodes ofMurderbotrelease every Friday on Apple TV+ through July 11, 2025.

    "title": "CERN gears up to ship antimatter across Europe",
    "article_text": "A portable containment device that can be dropped on a truck. There's a lot of matter around, which ensures that any antimatterproduced experiences a very short lifespan. Studying antimatter, therefore, has been extremely difficult. But that's changed a bit in recent years, as CERN has set up a facility that produces and traps antimatter, allowing forextensive studiesof itsproperties, includingentire anti-atoms. Unfortunately, the hardware used to capture antiprotons also produces interference that limits the precision with which measurements can be made. So CERN decided that it might be good to determine how to move the antimatter away from where it's produced. Since it was tackling that problem anyway, CERN decided to make a shipping container for antimatter, allowing it to be put on a truck and potentially taken to labs throughout Europe. The problem facing CERN comes from its own hardware. The antimatter it captures is produced by smashing a particle beam into a stationary target. As a result, all the anti-particles that come out of the debris carry a lot of energy. If you want to hold on to any of them, you have to slow them down, which is done using electromagnetic fields that can act on the charged antimatter particles. Unfortunately, as the team behind the new work notes, many of the measurements we'd like to do with the antimatter are \"extremely sensitive to external magnetic field noise.\" In short, the hardware that slows the antimatter down limits the precision of the measurements you can take. The obvious solution is to move the antimatter away from where it's produced. But that gets tricky very fast. The antimatter containment device has to be maintained as an extreme vacuum and needs superconducting materials to produce the electromagnetic fields that keep the antimatter from bumping into the walls of the container. All of that means a significant power supply, along with a cache of liquid helium to keep the superconductors working. A standard shipping container just won't do. So the team at CERN built a two-meter-long portable containment device. On one end is a junction that allows it to be plugged into the beam of particles produced by the existing facility. That junction leads to the containment area, which is blanketed by a superconducting magnet. Elsewhere on the device are batteries to ensure an uninterrupted power supply, along with the electronics to run it all. The whole setup is encased in a metal frame that includes lifting points that can be used to attach it to a crane for moving around. To confirm it all works, the team loaded it up with some protons (which are notably easier to produce). Two internal cranes in the facility, along with a heavy-duty four-wheeled cart, moved the container to a loading dock, where it was transferred to a truck and taken for a spin around the CERN campus at Meyrin. Based on the map included in the paper describing the work, it appears that the protons started out in France but briefly crossed the border into Switzerland. All told, they traveled just under 4 kilometers and reached speeds of over 40 km/hour. Overall, the hardware stayed cold, generally at a bit over 5 Kelvin. The exception was when the system was reconnected to the antimatter source hardware and the system reconnected to the electrical system at CERN. While those actions show up as temperature spikes, the superconducting magnets remained well under 7 Kelvin. An accelerometer was in place to track the forces experienced by the hardware while the truck was moving. This showed that changes in the truck's speed produced turbulence in the liquid helium, making measurements of its presence unreliable. Levels had dropped from about 75 percent of maximum to 30 percent by the time the system was reconnected, suggesting that liquid helium presents the key limiting factor in shipping. Measurements made while the system was in transit suggest that the whole process occurred losslessly, meaning that not a single proton escaped during the entire transport. All that's missing now is another experiment at CERN that the antimatter can be delivered to. Presumably, the team is looking for lab space in a building with little in the way of stray electromagnetic fields. But the team has bigger goals in mind. There's a facility being built in Düsseldorf, Germany, for antiproton experiments, nearly 800 kilometers and eight hours away by road. If the delivery can be made successfully—and it appears we are just a liquid helium supply away from getting it to work—the new facility in Germany should allow measurements with a precision of over 100 times better than anything that has been achieved at CERN.

    "title": "Removing the weakest link in electrified autonomous transport: Humans",
    "article_text": "Hands-off charging could open the door to a revolution in autonomous freight. Thanks to our new global tariff war, the wild world of importing and exporting has been thrust into the forefront. There's a lot of logistics involved in keeping your local Walmart stocked and your Amazon Prime deliveries happening, and you might be surprised at how much of that world has already been automated. While cars from autonomy providers likeWaymoare still extremely rare in most stretches of the open road, the process of loading and unloading cargo has become almost entirely automated at some major ports around the world. Likewise, there's an increasing shift to electrify the various vehicles involved along the way, eliminating a significant source of global emissions. But there's been one sticking point in this automated, electrified logistical dream: plugging in. The humble act of charging still happens via human hands, but that's changing. At a testing facility in Sweden, a company called Rocsys has demonstrated an automated charger that works with self-driving electric trucks fromEinridein a hands-free and emissions-free partnership that could save time, money, and even lives. Shipping ports are pretty intimidating places. Towering cranes stand 500 feet above the ground, swinging 30-ton cargo crates into the air and endlessly moving them from giant ships to holding pens and then turning around and sending off the next set of shipments. That cargo is then loaded onto container handlers that operate exclusively within the confines of the port, bringing the crates closer to the roads or rail lines that will take them further. They're stacked again until the arrival of their next ride, semi-trucks for cargo about to hit the highway or empty rail cars for anything train-bound. Believe it or not, that entire process happens autonomously at some of the most advanced ports in the world. \"The APM terminal in Rotterdam port is, I would say, in the top three of the most advanced terminals in the world. It's completely automated. There are hardly any people,\" Crijn Bouman, the CEO and co-founder of Rocsys, said. Eliminating the human factor at facilities like ports reduces cost and increases safety at a workplace that is, according to the CDC, five times more dangerous than average. But the one link in the chain that hasn't been automated is recharging. Those cargo haulers may be able to drive themselves to the charger, but they still can't plug themselves in. They need a little help, and that's where Rocsys comes in. The genesis of Rocsys came in 2017, when cofounder Bouman visited a fledgling robotaxi operator in the Bay Area. \"The vehicles were driving themselves, but after a couple of test laps, they would park themselves in the corner, and a person would walk over and plug them in,\" Bouman said. Bouman wouldn't tell me which autonomy provider was operating the place, but he was surprised to see that the company was focused only on the wildly complex task of shuttling people from place to place on open roads. Meanwhile, the seemingly simple act of plugging and unplugging was handled exclusively by human operators. Fast-forward eight years, and The Netherlands-based Rocsys now has more than 50 automated chargers deployed globally, with a goal to install thousands more. While the company is targeting robotaxi operators for its automated charging solution, initial interest is primarily in port and fleet operators as those businesses become increasingly electrified. Bouman calls Rocsys' roboticized charger a \"robotic steward,\" a charming moniker for an arm that sticks a plug in a hole. But it's all more complicated than that, of course. The steward relies on an AI- and vision-based system to move an arm holding the charger plug. That arm offers six degrees of freedom and, thanks to the wonders of machine learning, largely trains itself to interface with new cars and new chargers. It can reach high and low enough and at enough angles to cover everything from consumer cars to commercial trucks. It even works with plugs of all shapes and sizes. The biggest complication? Manual charging flaps on some consumer cars. This has necessitated a little digital extension to the steward's robotic arm. \"We'll have sort of a finger assembly to open the charge port cover, connect the plug, and also the system can close it. So no change to the vehicle,\" Bouman said. That said, Bouman hopes manufacturers will ditch manual charge port covers and switch to powered, automatic ones in future vehicles. Plenty of companies around the globe are promising to electrify trucking, from medium-duty players likeHarbingerto the world's largest piece of rolling vaporware, theTesla Semi. Few are actually operating the things, though. Stockholm-based Einride is one of those companies. Its electric trucks are making deliveries every day, taking things a step further by removing the driver from the equation. The wild-looking cab-less autonomous electric transport (AET) vehicles, which would not look out of place thundering down the highway in any science-fiction movie, are self-driving in most situations. But they do have a human backup in the form of operators at what Einride's general manager of autonomous technology, Henrik Green, calls control towers. Here, operators can oversee multiple trucks, ensuring safe operation and handling any unexpected happenings on the road. In this way, a single person can operate multiple trucks from afar, only connecting when it requires manual intervention. \"The more vehicles we can use with the same workforce of people, the higher the efficiency,\" he said. Green said Einride has multiple remote control towers overseeing the company's pilot deployments. Here in the US, Einride has been running a route at GE Appliance's Selmer, Tennessee, facility, where autonomous forklifts load cargo onto the autonomous trucks for hands-off hauling of your next refrigerator. Right now, the AETs must be manually plugged in by an on-site operator. It's a minor task, but Green said that automating this process could be game-changing. \"There are, surprisingly, a lot of trucks today that are standing still or running empty,\" Green said. Part of this comes down to poor logistical planning, but a lot is due to the human factor. \"With automated electric trucks, we can make the transportation system more sustainable, more efficient, more resilient, and absolutely more safe.\" Getting humans out of the loop could result in Einride's machines operating 24/7, only pausing to top off their batteries. Self-charging, self-driving trucks could also help open the door to longer-distance deliveries without having to saddle them with giant batteries. Even with regular charging stops, these trucks could operate at a higher utilization than human-driven machines, which can only run for as long as their operators are legally or physically able to. That could result in significant cost savings for businesses, and, since everything is electric, the environmental potential is strong, too. \"Around 7 percent of the world's global CO2footprint today comes from land transportation, which is what we are addressing with electric heavy-duty transportation,\" Green said. This first joining of a Rocsys robotic steward and an Einride AET took place at the AstaZero proving ground in Sandhult, Sweden, an automation test facility that has been a safe playground for driverless vehicles of all shapes and sizes for over a decade. This physical connection between Rocsys and Einride is a small step, with one automated charger connected to one automated truck, compared to the nearly 3 million diesel-powered semis droning around our highways in the United States alone. But you have to start somewhere, and while bringing this technology to more open roads is the goal, closed logistics centers and ports are a great first step. \"The use case is simpler,\" Bouman said. \"There are no cats and dogs jumping, or children, or people on bicycles.\" And how complicated was it to connect Einride's systems to those of the Rocsys robotic steward? Green said the software integration with the Rocsys system was straightforward but that \"some adaptations\" were required to make Einride's machine compatible. \"We had to make a 'duct tape solution' for this particular demo,\" Green said. Applying duct tape, at least, seems like a safe job for humans for some time to come. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Anno 117 Pax Romana hands-on: Gorgeous, deep, and tricky to learn",
    "article_text": "After a return to form inAnno 1800,117aims to seize an even bigger audience. Ubisoft provided flights from Chicago to Rome and accommodation so that Ars could participate in the preview opportunity for Anno 117: Pax Romana. Ars does not accept paid editorial content. There aren't any games quite like the Anno series, and based on some hands-on time at a recent press junket, I can say that the latest entry has the potential to be an appealing on-ramp for history buffs and strategy game fans who haven't explored the franchise before—provided players approach it with a lot of patience. The previous entry in the series, 2019'sAnno 1800, was seen as something of a return to form by longtime franchise fans, who weren't as thrilled with the futuristic entries that preceded it. It reportedly reached 5 million players, which is quite a lot for a PC-focused strategy title, so1800was a popularization moment for the franchise, too. Anno 117: Pax Romana, due later this year, aims to build on that momentum and turn the franchise into a crossover hit. While the Anno games have long been popular with a certain crowd (strategy gamers in Europe, and specifically Germany, where the games are developed), its addictive gameplay and top-tier presentation have the potential to appeal with even more people, provided publisher Ubisoft makes the right choices. Throughout its decades of history, I've dabbled with the Anno series of strategy games, but it has always been on my \"someday I think I'llreallyget into this\" list. Last month, I attended a press junket where a preview build of the game was available to play for about three hours—a chance to see if it successfully follows up on1800. In my time with it, I found that the bones of the game are promising, and the presentation is outstanding. That said, the new-player onboarding experience will have to improve for the game to find new audiences. Anno games are part city builders, part supply chain simulations. Like many builders, you lay down roads, build critical infrastructure like firefighting structures, and develop your population in size and wealth. But all of that dovetails with systems of developing and harvesting natural resources, converting them into produced goods, and turning those produced goods into both wealth and further development for your settlements. You have to pay careful attention to where you place things. For example, warehouses are needed to store goods that you're gathering or making, and those warehouses have to be strategically positioned to allow the right goods to flow from one structure to another. Ultimately, you build settlements on multiple islands, connecting them with trade routes and naval units. Natural resources can be island-specific, so your islands end up with specializations. On top of all that, there's a story, and there are other, AI-controlled leaders scattered around the map you have to either coordinate or skirmish with. The Anno games have a unique identity, and there's a lot to learn for new players, even if those players have played other city builders or economic sims (though, of course, prior background won't hurt). That said, it all becomes relaxing and smooth as butter once you learn it. The game won't satisfy players who are looking for conquest or tactical combat, though, as that's not an emphasis. You could argue that the main selling point ofAnno 117: Pax Romanacompared to its predecessors is its setting; it's one of the most requested settings and time periods by fans of the franchise, and it's a natural fit for the game's mechanics. I'll admit I was swept up in the game's aesthetic presentation while playing it. As the rosy subtitle \"Pax Romana\" implies, this is the Roman Empire at its most idealized. The wheat fields practically glow golden-yellow, the citizens work and mingle while wearing gorgeous and colorful clothes, and the music swells and soothes with ancient vibes. Sure, the actual Roman Empire had something awful to offer to counterbalance every positive image we have, but Anno 117prefersan escapist fantasy, much like many prior entries in the franchise. This is a game about enjoying the idealized aesthetics embedded in our collective cultural memories while building something you're proud of, not tackling thorny historical or moral realities. It's moreSimCitythanFrostpunk. All told, the game's artistic and technical presentation is top-notch. It pulls you into the setting, which is further thematically reinforced with the resources and products you gather and produce, as well as some of the new mechanics and the occasional story-based dialogue prompts. The aesthetic experience is easily one of the strongest parts. There are a few other selling points, too. First, there are new mechanics, like a religion system, a more robust research tree, and the return of ground-based military forces to go along with the franchise's standard light inclusion of naval conflict. I wasn't able to engage with the army aspect in this demo, but I did get to touch on the religion system and the research tree. Shortly into founding the settlement on your island, you can build a temple to one of the game's deities. Each deity provides bonuses that help you specialize your focus. For mine, I chose Ceres, the Roman goddess of agriculture and fertility. That gave me significant bonuses for my farms. If I had chosen Poseidon instead, my ships would have moved faster, among other things. Compared to strategy games that make religion a major factor in how the game is played, this system wasn't particularly robust or deep in the demo I played, but as I alluded to above, it was a nice way to reinforce the aesthetic and the themes in the game. Plus, it gives you a way to customize what you're building in a fun way. The research tree sprawls out in multiple directions, winding around on different tangents. In my time with it, it seemed to be composed largely of numerical bonuses to things like yields or ship speed and wasn't too focused on introducing totally new mechanics. It's a nice inclusion in terms of just giving you more customization and choice, but it's by no means a game changer, and it doesn't represent a fundamentally new approach to the game. It's also worth noting that you can now build diagonal roads and place buildings diagonally on them, allowing you to free yourself from the rigid grid. That said, I found that grids still seemed optimal in most cases, so this is a perk for beauty builders (which is totally valid!), but it won't generally sway folks focused on efficiency. There's one other major feature I didn't get to try out during my time with the game. The developers say that players will be able to choose to build either in a Rome/Mediterranean-themed network of islands or a British frontier-themed area from the start. I was only able to try the former during this demo. For the Anno games to become as mainstream as the developer hopes, they'll have to become much easier to learn and get into.Anno 1800made strides here with its story-based tutorial, though that tutorial was also criticized for some unnecessary busywork and being a bit too involved for existing fans. Unfortunately, I felt during my time withAnno 117that the onboarding experience was a step back from1800. Right off the bat, the tutorial instructed me to do something but skipped a crucial step with no explanation, causing five minutes of confusion. As I progressed, story content guided me further along with objectives, but key systems were left unexplained. Since I played1800a bit before, I was able to figure it out, but I still had to ask for help from a nearby developer to progress on two occasions. Another journalist sitting next to me who had no prior experience with the franchise seemed totally lost. On the bright side, the game benefits immensely from a beautifully thought-out user interface, which is ordered in a logical and intuitive manner. It's particularly strong at giving the player a sense of the impact of the choices they're about to make—for example, by indicating with overlays on nearby buildings how placing a building in one spot might be more advantageous than placing it in another. To some extent, this makes up for the relatively anemic tutorial, as many (but not all) of the game's most important concepts are intuitively obvious from the user interface alone. That's in stark contrast to another recent big-budget, mainstream strategy game release (Civilization VII), which offered robust onboarding tutorials but also hada user interfacethat at times failed completely to indicate to players what their choices meant. Anno 117's mechanics themselves are intuitive once you've had the proper introduction, and I don't think the game inherently needs to be difficult to learn. But the tutorial experience needs to improve to reduce that initial friction so new players don't bounce off quickly.Anno 1800may have been too heavy-handed here, butAnno 117seems to overreact by going too far the other way. The launch is months away, though, so there's time to improve these things, and it wouldn't take that much to do so. I'm hopeful, anyway. The Anno games scratch an itch that no other games do, and based on a few hours with a preview build,Anno 117seems like a promising entry in that unique tradition. Numbers-obsessed efficiency mavens can go quite deep with optimization to set up the best economic powerhouses possible, but the game's systems are flexible enough to allow aesthetics-focused beauty builders to get creative and expressive instead—virtually any combination of those two approaches is viable, too. The appeal is elevated by visuals that are definitely a cut above the usual for strategy, simulation, or builder games, and the Ancient Roman setting gives the game's technical artists ample space to create an immersive experience. Anno 117doesn't seem to reinvent the experience compared to1800, but after the controversial attempts that preceded both of these titles, that may not be a bad thing. It's fun once you get going—I found the minutes drifting away from me as I took in the sights and watched all the right numbers tick up at a satisfying pace because of my choices. I'm not part of the existing core audience for this franchise, so it's hard for me to predict how they'll respond to it—there are a lot of finer details they'll be sensitive to that I'm not yet. My guess, though, is that longtime fans will probably be happy with this one provided it gets most of those things right, with the usual strategy-game sequel caveat that post-launch content has madeAnno 1800much more robust thanAnno 117is likely to be at launch. There's promise here for newcomers, but Ubisoft Mainz will have to keep working on that tutorial and onboarding experience to really break the dam the way they hope to. That's really my primary concern about this title. We'll find out how that goes when the game launches on Windows, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S sometime later this year. One way or the other, I intend to play more of it when it releases to see if this is the first Anno game that becomes an obsession instead of a passing interest.

    "title": "New Orleans called out for sketchiest use of facial recognition yet in the US",
    "article_text": "Facial recognition cameras ping cops when suspects appear, sparking backlash. New Orleans police have reportedly spent years scanning live feeds of city streets and secretly using facial recognition to identify suspects in real time—in seeming defiance of a city ordinance designed to prevent false arrests and protect citizens' civil rights. A Washington Postinvestigationuncovered the dodgy practice, which relied on a private network of more than 200 cameras to automatically ping cops' phones when a possible match for a suspect was detected. Court records and public data suggest that these cameras \"played a role in dozens of arrests,\" the Post found, but most uses were never disclosed in police reports. That seems like a problem, the Post reported, since a 2022 city council ordinance required much more oversight for the tech. Rather than instantly detaining supposed suspects the second they pop up on live feeds, cops were only supposed to use the tech to find \"specific suspects in their investigations of violent crimes,\" the Post reported. And in those limited cases, the cops were supposed to send images to a \"fusion center,\" where at least two examiners \"trained in identifying faces\" using AI software had to agree on alleged matches before cops approached suspects. Instead, the Post found that \"none\" of the arrests \"were included in the department’s mandatory reports to the city council.\" And at least four people arrested were charged with nonviolent crimes. Some cops apparently found the city council process too sluggish and chose to ignore it to get the most out of their access to the tech, the Post found. Now, New Orleans police have paused the program amid backlash over what Nathan Freed Wessler, the deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, suggested might be the sketchiest use of facial recognition yet in the US. He told the Post this is \"the first known widespread effort by police in a major US city to use AI to identify people in live camera feeds for the purpose of making immediate arrests.\" New Orleans Police Department superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick told the Post that she would be conducting a review of the program and turning off all automated alerts until she is \"sure that the use of the app meets all the requirements of the law and policies.\" The ACLU is demanding a stronger response, asking for a full investigation into how many arrests were made and urging NOPD to permanently stop using the AI-enhanced feeds. In a statement sent to Ars, Alanah Odoms, the executive director of the ACLU of Louisiana, said that without a full investigation, there would be no way to know the extent of potential harms of the secret AI surveillance to the community. \"We cannot ignore the real possibility of this tool being weaponized against marginalized communities, especially immigrants, activists, and others whose only crime is speaking out or challenging government policies,\" Odoms said. \"These individuals could be added to Project Nola's watchlist without the public’s knowledge and with no accountability or transparency on the part of the police departments.\" The cameras in New Orleans are operated by Project Nola, a nonprofit founded by a former cop, Bryan Lagarde, who wanted to help police more closely monitor the city's \"crime-heavy areas,\" the Post reported. Configured to scan live footage for people \"on a list of wanted suspects,\" the camera network supposedly assisted in at least 34 arrests since 2023, Project Nola has claimed in social media posts. But the Post struggled to verify that claim, since \"the city does not track such data and the nonprofit does not publish a full accounting of its cases.\" According to police records submitted to the city council, the network \"only proved useful in a single case.\" Investigating the tension between these claims, the Post suggested we may never know how many suspects were misidentified or what steps police took to ensure responsible use of the controversial live feeds. In the US, New Orleans stands out for taking a step further than law enforcement in other regions by using live feeds from facial recognition cameras to make immediate arrests, the Post noted. The Security Industry Association told the Post that four states—Maryland, Montana, Vermont, and Virginia—and 19 cities nationwide \"explicitly bar\" the practice. Lagarde told the Post that police cannot \"directly\" search for suspects on the camera network or add suspects to the watchlist in real time. Reese Harper, an NOPD spokesperson, told the Post that his department \"does not own, rely on, manage, or condone the use by members of the department of any artificial intelligence systems associated with the vast network of Project Nola crime cameras.\" In a federally mandated 2023 audit, New Orleans police complained that complying with the ordinance took too long and \"often\" resulted in no matches. That could mean the tech is flawed, or it could be a sign that the process was working as intended to prevent wrongful arrests. The Post noted that in total, \"at least eight Americans have been wrongfully arrested due to facial recognition,\" as, when both police and AI software rush arrests, mistakes are prone to happen. \"By adopting this system–in secret, without safeguards, and at tremendous threat to our privacy and security–the City of New Orleans has crossed a thick red line,\" Wessler said. \"This is the stuff of authoritarian surveillance states and has no place in American policing.\" Project Nola did not immediately respond to Ars' request for comment.

    "title": "Epic goes to court to force Fortnite back on US iOS",
    "article_text": "Game has been pulled offline in Europe amid legal tussling. Afterlast month's bombshell legal rulingforcing Apple to allow the use of external payment processors for in-app purchases on iOS, Epic CEO and founder Tim Sweeney said Epic Games was \"going to do everything we can to bringFortniteback to the iOS App Store.\" That \"everything\" now includesa legal motionin the District Court of California seeking to force Apple to \"accept any compliant version ofFortniteonto the US storefront of the App Store.\" Apple removedFortnitefrom the App Store and terminated Epic's US App Store account in August 2020 after Epicsnuck its famous Epic Direct Payments \"hotfix\" into the game(thereby setting offa yearslong legal battle). On May 9, though, Epic used an iOS account for its Swedish subsidiary—whichwas recently used to take advantage of Europe's DMA policies—to submit a new version ofFortniteto the US App Store. Apple formally rejected that submission on May 15, saying ina letter shared by Epicthat it believes the recent court rulings \"do not diminish Apple’s bases and legal right to have terminated Epic Games’ [iOS developer account].\" Even under that new ruling, Apple notes, the 2020 \"hotfix\" allowing Epic Direct Paymentsinside the apprather than via an external storefront would still violate Apple's current lawful restrictions on such practices. \"Apple has determined not to take action on theFortniteapp submission until after the Ninth Circuit rules on our pending request for a partial stay of the new injunction,\" the company wrote in its letter. In the meantime, Apple suggested that the Swedish Epic Games account should submit a separate updated version of the game—without a US App Store listing request—to prevent this situation from \"impactingFortnitein other geographies.\" But ina social media post, Epic said the suggestion to submit different versions of the game for different markets is \"in violation of [Apple's] guideline that developers shouldn’t submit multiple versions of the same app.\" As such, Epic said Apple is effectively \"blocking us from releasing our update in the EU and US.\" In an attempt to force Apple's hand, Epicfiled a motionon Friday arguing that Apple's latestFortnitedenial is \"blatant retaliation\" for Epic's court challenge and an attempt to \"circumvent this Court's Injunctions and this Court's authority.\" Epic says the iOS version ofFortniteit recently submitted complies with all Apple policies and court rulings by offering a link to the external Epic Games Store for purchases. Through that link, players would be able to take advantage of a 20 percent discount on purchases compared to in-app purchases through iOS itself. \"Although Apple’s contracts may permit it to reject an app for lawful reasons, the Injunction provides that Apple may no longer reject an app—includingFortnite—because its developer chooses to include an external purchase link,\" Epic wrote. \"Likewise, if the Injunction is to have any teeth, Apple cannot reject an app on the ground that its developer has sought to enforce the Injunction’s prohibitions.\" Elsewhere in the filing, Epic says it is being \"punished\" by Apple after a nearly five-year legal battle and is being denied the ability to \"take advantage of the pro-competitive rules it helped usher in.\" Epic argues that Apple \"cannot reject any developer (including Epic) because they went to court to enforce the Injunction\" and \"cannot refuse to deal with Epic as retaliation for Epic’s decision to avail itself of this Court’s Injunction.\" The matter will now be taken up by Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, who has shown little love for Apple in recent weeks. In her April order, she took the company to task for its \"clear and convincing violation\" of her initial injunction and even made a criminal contempt referral for Apple executives who she said \"outright lied under oath.\" \"Apple’s continued attempts to interfere with competition will not be tolerated,\" Gonzalez Rogers wrote at the time. \"This is an injunction, not a negotiation. There are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order. Time is of the essence.

    "title": "Experts alarmed over Trump’s promotion of deep-sea mining in international waters",
    "article_text": "Critics call for an industry moratorium until more scientific data can be obtained. This article originally appeared onInside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletterhere. In 2013, a deep-sea mining company named UK Seabed Resources contracted marine biologist Diva Amon and other scientists from the University of Hawaii at Manoa to survey a section of the seafloor in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, a vast swath of international waters located in the Pacific Ocean that spans around 2 million square miles between Hawaii and Mexico. The area is known to have an abundant supply of rocky deposits the size of potatoes called polymetallic nodules. They are rich in metals like nickel, cobalt, copper, and manganese, which have historically been used to make batteries and electric vehicles. Someday, the company envisioned it might profit from mining them. But first it wanted to know more about the largely unexplored abyssal environment where they were found, Amon said. Using a remotely operated vehicle equipped with cameras and lights, she began documenting life 2.5 miles deep. On one of the robot’s first dives, an anemone-like creature with 8-foot-long billowing tentacles appeared about two feet above the seabed. It was attached to the stem of a sea sponge anchored on one of the valuable nodules. Amon was overwhelmed with excitement. It was likely a new species, she said. She also felt a sense of grief. “Here was this incredibly beautiful animal,” she said, “that no one has likely ever seen before.” And they might not ever again. “I feel this immense sadness at the potential that this place that we have come to survey may be mined and essentially destroyed in the future,” she remembers thinking at that moment. Now, more than a decade later, Amon worries her fears may be coming to fruition. On April 24, President Trump signedan executive orderpromoting deep-sea mining in the US and international waters, touting the industry’s potential to boost the country’s economic growth and national security. “These resources are key to strengthening our economy, securing our energy future, and reducing dependence on foreign suppliers for critical minerals,” the order states. In an online post last month, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) described the political move as a step toward paving the way for “The Next Gold Rush,” stating: “Critical minerals are used in everything from defense systems and batteries to smartphones and medical devices. Access to these minerals is a key factor in the health and resilience of US supply chains.” The order, titled “Unleashing America’s Offshore Critical Minerals and Resources,” charges NOAA and the Secretary of Commerce with expediting the process for reviewing and issuing licenses to explore and permits to mine seabed minerals in areas beyond national jurisdiction. Less than a week after it was issued, a US subsidiary of the Canadian deep-sea mining corporation calledThe Metals Company submitted its first applicationsto explore and exploit polymetallic nodules in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone. If approved, the company could be the first to mine in international waters. It would also be the first to do so under US law, sparking a rebuke from those opposed to the industry. These ocean advocates say the risks of mining far outweigh the benefits of maintaining a healthy deep-sea ecosystem, which plays a vital role in managing the global climate by absorbing heat and excess carbon dioxide. During aHouse Committee on Natural Resources oversight hearingon the potential impact of deep-sea mining on the American economy—held in April on the same day The Metals Company made its announcement—US Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) critiqued the president’s order. “Despite what proponents claim, it is not the great silver bullet,” he said. “The industry has very questionable market prospects because battery technology is rapidly changing,” he said. “[Electrical vehicle] markets are already moving away from the nickel, cobalt, copper and manganese found in deep-sea nodules towards other minerals.” Prior to the president’s order, morethan 900 leading scientists and marine policy experts from over 70 countries,including Amon from Trinidad and Tobago, had signed a statement calling for a precautionary pause on deep-sea mining until more scientific data was obtained to prove related activity would not harm the marine environment. Thirty-three countries, including Canada, France, the United Kingdom, and a number of Pacific Island Countries like Fiji and Vanuatu, are also calling fora moratorium or outright ban on deep-sea mining, according to the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition, an alliance of more than 100 organizations dedicated to protecting the ocean’s depths. “You cannot authorize mining that’s going to cause biodiversity loss, that’s going to cause irreparable damage to the marine environment, that is going to potentially drive species extinct before we even discover them, until you can sort all that out, until you have enough knowledge to understand how you can prevent that kind of stuff from happening,” said Matthew Gianni, the coalition’s co-founder and political and policy advisor. Some Indigenous peoples say deep-sea mining also threatens their cultural heritage. Native Hawaiians, for example, believe the deep sea is where life began. “The action of deep-sea mining is such a destructive process, and that process now intrudes into this place, in the story of my beginning, my creation,” said Solomon Pili Kahoʻohalahala, a seventh-generation Indigenous Hawaiian elder and descendant from the island of Lānaʻi. Legal experts also question whether Trump can authorize this activity. The International Seabed Authority (ISA) is the only organization that can legally approve mining in international waters, sometimes referred to as high seas or the “Area,” according to Duncan Currie, an attorney who has practiced international and environmental law for more than 25 years. The organization was established under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), an international treaty that provides a legal framework for governing maritime rights related to shipping, navigation, marine commerce, and the peaceful and sustainable use of ocean resources. Currie said Trump’s new order falsely purports decision-making power over international waters, citing an outdated law called the Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act (DSHMRA). The act was passed in 1980—two years before UNCLOS was established—with the intent of serving as a temporary mechanism for regulating deep-sea mining until an international oversight body could be put into place. But the convention has never been ratified by the US Senate. “It has always been seen as an interim or bootstraps provision,” said Currie, who provided expert legal testimony at theHouse Committee on Natural Resources hearing on deep-sea miningin April. To grant companies permission to mine the deep sea under US law in areas far outside the country’s jurisdiction is unlawful, he said in an interview. “That would be a breach of international law without a shadow of a doubt,” he said. It would also set a dangerous precedent, Currie said. “If the United States can do it, other countries can do it. And so this is very concerning.” The International Seabed Authority’s Secretary-General Leticia Reis de Carvalho responded to Trump’s order in astatement:“This can only refer to resources found on the US seabed and ocean floor because everything beyond is the common heritage of humankind,” Carvalho said. “No State has the right to unilaterally exploit the mineral resources of the Area outside the legal framework established by UNCLOS.” This applies to all nations, including those who have not ratified the treaty, like the US, she said. Since the US never signed or ratified the treaty, it is not a voting member of the ISA, which includes 169 member states, plus the European Union. But, for the last 30 years, the US has still been an active participant in ISA negotiations aimed at developing industry regulations in aMining Code,according to Carvalho. “The US has been a reliable observer and significant contributor to the negotiations of the International Seabed Authority, actively providing technical expertise to each stage of the development of the ISA regulatory framework,” she said in her statement. It is all the more “surprising,” she said, that the US would now preemptively circumvent the code the ISA aims to adopt later this year. “It is the foundation for ensuring that any activities in the Area benefit all humanity, for present and future generations, while protecting the marine environment,” Carvalho’s statement said. Below 650 feet, rays of sunlight cease to pierce the deep ocean, which makes up the planet’s largest ecosystem. “It provides more than 95 percent of all the habitable space on Earth,” said Amon, who explored parts of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone in 2013 and 2015 as a contractor for UK Seabed Resources, a company once owned by Lockheed Martin andacquired in 2023 by Norway’s Loke Marine Minerals.Lokefiled for bankruptcy in April. Amon has co-led or participated in deep-sea scientific expeditions in the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Mariana Trench National Marine Monument in the Pacific Ocean, among other places. “There’s new estimates that it’s actually .001 percent of the deep sea that has ever been seen with human eyes or camera,” she said.“We really, really haven’t scratched the surface.” It is at these depths where thousands of species—the majority of which have yet to be identified or described—have specially adapted to live, she said. “From sharks that glow in the dark to blind white crabs that farm bacteria on their chests that they eat to corals that can live for millennia.” Much of this life revolves around or depends upon the polymetallic nodules that mining companies plan to extract using massive industrial machinery. “That process is going to destroy any biodiversity in the path of the vehicle because a lot of these animals can’t move,” Amon said. Similar to a pearl, each of these nodules once began as a shark tooth or single piece of sediment that accrued layers of metals and minerals from the seawater “at a rate of just a few millimeters per million years,” the marine biologist said. These nodules litter parts of the seafloor in patches, like cobblestones on a street, she said. Some of them are millions of years old, Amon said, and comprise a key part of the deep-sea ecosystem–“a whole thriving community down there”—so colorful and diverse that it conjures images of a Dr. Seuss book. Purple, yellow, and white sea cucumbers. Brittle stars that resemble starfish but have long flexible arms. And corals, sponges, and anemones that use the polymetallic nodules as anchors to hold still and thrive on a seabed of silt, which, when mined, will be upturned and transformed into sediment plumes. The plumes likely will form a sort of blinding “dust cloud” that will travel vertically and horizontally in the water far from the original mining sites, Amon said. The cloud may disorient and impair the vision of marine life that depend on sight to navigate or hunt for prey—or smother others. “You can very safely say this mining would essentially lead to irreversible damage,” she said.

    "title": "HBO’s The Last of Us S2E6 recap: Look who’s back!",
    "article_text": "Some of the most impactful scenes from the game get the HBO treatment. New episodes of season 2 ofThe Last of Usare premiering on HBO every Sunday night, and Ars' Kyle Orland (who's played the games) and Andrew Cunningham (who hasn't)will be talking about them here after they air. While these recaps don't delve into every single plot point of the episode, there are obviouslyheavy spoilerscontained within, so go watch the episode first if you want to go in fresh. Kyle: Going from a sudden shot of beatific Pedro Pascal at the end of the last episode to a semi-related flashback with a young Joel Miller and his brother was certainly a choice. I almost respect how overtly they are just screwing with audience expectations here. As for the opening flashback scene itself, I guess the message is \"Hey, look at the generational trauma his family was dealing with—isn't it great he overcame that to love Ellie?\" But I'm not sure I can draw a straight line from \"he got beat by his dad\" to \"he condemned the entire human race for his surrogate daughter.\" Andrew: I do not have the same problems you did with either the Joel pop-in at the end of the last episode or the flashback at the start of this episode—last week, the show was signaling \"here comes Joel!\" and this week the show is signaling \"look, it's Joel!\" Maybe I'm just responding to Tony Dalton as Joel's dad, who I know best as the charismatic lunatic Lalo Salamanca fromBetter Call Saul. I do agree that the throughline between these two events is shaky, though, and without the flashback to fill us in, the \"I hope you can do a little better than me\" sentiment feels like something way out of left field. But I dunno, it's Joel week. Joel's back! This is the Duality of Joel: you can simultaneously think that he is horrible for failing a civilization-scale trolley problem when he killed a building full of Fireflies to save Ellie, and you can't help but be utterly charmed by Pedro Pascal enthusiastically describing the many ways to use a Dremel. (He's right! It's a versatile tool!) Truly, there's pretty much nothing in this episode that we couldn't have inferred or guessed at based on the information the show has already made available to us. And I say this as a non-game-player—I didn't need to see exactlyhowtheir relationship became as strained as it was by the beginning of the season to have some idea of why it happened, nor did I need to see The Porch Scene to understand that their bond nevertheless endured. But this is alsothe dynamic that everybody came to the show forlast season, so I can only make myself complain about it to a point. Kyle: It's true, Joel Week is a time worth celebrating. If I'm coming across as cranky about it at the outset, it's probably because this whole episode is a realization of what we're missing out on this season thanks to Joel's death. As you said, a lot of this episode was filling in gaps that could well have been inferred from events we did see. But I would have easily taken a full season (or a full second game) of Ellie growing up and Joel dealing with Ellie growing up. You could throw in some zombie attacks or an overarching Big Bad enemy or something if you want, but the development of Joel and Ellie's relationship deserves more than just some condensed flashbacks. Andrew: Yeah, it's hard not to be upset about the original sin ofThe Last of Us Part 2which is (assuming it's like the show) that having some boring underbaked villain crawl out of the woodwork to kill the show's main character is kind of a cheap shot. Sure, you shock the hell out of viewers like me who didn't see it coming! But part of the reason I didn't see it coming is because if you kill Joel, you need to do a whole bunch of your showwithout Joeland why on Earth would you decide to do that? To be clear, I don't mind this season so much, and I've found things to like about it, though Ellie does sometimes veer into being a protagonist so short-sighted and impulsive and occasionally just-plain-stupid that it's hard to be in her corner. But yeah, flashing back to a time just two months after the end of season 1 really does make you wonder, \"Why couldn't the story just be this?\" Kyle: In the gaming space, I understand the desire to not have your sequel game be just \"more of the same\" from the last game. But I've always feltThe Last of Us Part 2veered too hard in the other direction and became something almost entirely unrecognizable from the original game I loved. But let's focus on what we do get in this episode, which is an able recreation of my favorite moment from the second game, Ellie enjoying the heck out of a ruined science museum. The childlike wonder she shows here is a great respite from a lot of action-heavy scenes in the game, and I think it serves the same purpose here. It's also much more drawn out in the game—I could have luxuriated in just this part of the flashback for an entire episode! Andrew: Theonlything that kept me from being fully on board with that scene was that I think Ellie was acting quite a bit younger than 16, with her pantomimed launch noises and flipping of switches, But I could believe that a kid who had such a rough and abbreviated childhood would have some fun sitting in an Apollo module. For someone with no memories of the pre-outbreak society, it must seem like science fiction, and the show gives us some lovely visuals to go with it. The things I like best here are the little moments in between scenes rather than the parts where the show insists on showing us events that it had already alluded to in other episodes. What sticks with me the most, as we jump between Ellie's birthdays, is Joel's insistence that \"we could do this kind of thing more often\" as they go to a museum or patrol the trails together. That it needs to be stated multiple times suggests that they are not, in fact, doing this kind of thing more often in between birthdays. Joel is thoughtful and attentive in his way—a little better than his father—but it's such a bittersweet little note, a surrogate dad's clumsy effort to bridge a gap that he knows is there but doesn't fully understand. Kyle: Yeah, I'm OK with a little arrested development in a girl that has been forced to miss so many of the markers of a \"normal\" pre-apocalypse childhood. But yeah, Joel is pretty clumsy about this. And as we see all of these attempts with his surrogate daughter, it's easy to forget what happened to his real daughter way back at the beginning of the first season. The trauma of that event shapes Joel in a way that I feel the narrative sometimes forgets about for long stretches. But then we get moments like Joel leading Gail's newly infected husband to a death that the poor guy would very much like to delay by an hour for one final moment with his wife. When Joel says that you can always close your eyes and see the face of the one you love, he may have been thinking about Ellie. But I like to think he was thinking about his actual daughter. Andrew: Yes to the extent that Joel's actions are relatable (I won't say \"excusable,\" but \"relatable\") it's because the undercurrent of his relationship with Ellie is that he can't watch another daughter die in his arms. I watched the first episode again recently, and that whole scene remains a masterfully executed gut-punch. But it's a tough tightrope to walk, because if the story spendstoomuch time focusing on it, you draw attention to how unhealthy it is for Joel to be forcing Ellie to play that role in his life. Don't get me wrong, Ellie was looking for a father figure, too, and that's why it works! It's a \"found family\" dynamic that they were both looking for. But I can't hear Joel's soothing \"baby girl\" epithet without it rubbing me the wrong way a little. My gut reaction was that it wasrightfor Joel not to fully trust Gail's husband, but then I realized I can nevernotsuspect Joe Pantoliano of treachery because of his role as betrayer in the 26-year-old movieThe Matrix. Brains are weird. Kyle: I did like the way Ellie tells Joel off for lying to her (and to Gail) about the killing; it's a real \"growing up\" moment for the character. And of course it transitions well into The Porch Scene, Ellie's ultimate moment of confronting Joel on his ultimate betrayal. While I'm not a fan of the head-fake \"this scene isn't going to happen\" thing they did earlier this season. I think the TV show once again did justice to one of the most impactful parts of the game. But the game also managed to spread out these Joel-centric flashbacks a little more, so we're not transitioning from \"museum fun\" to \"porch confrontation\" quite so quickly. Here, it feels like they're trying hard to rush through all of their \"bring back Pedro Pascal\" requirements in a single episode. Andrew: Yeah, because you don't need to pay a 3D model's appearance fees if you want to use it in a bunch of scenes of your video game. Pedro Pascal has other stuff going on! Kyle: That's probably part of it. But without giving too much away, I think we're seeing the limits of stretching the events of \"Part 2\" into what is essentially two seasons. While there have been some cuts, on the whole, it feels like there's also been a lot of filler to \"round out\" these characters in ways that have been more harmful than helpful at points. Andrew: Yeah, our episode ends by depositing us back in the main action, as Ellie returns to the abandoned theater where she and Dina have holed up. I'm curious to see what we're in for in this last run of almost-certainly-Joel-less episodes, but I suspect it involves a bunch of non-Joel characters ping-ponging between the WLF forces and the local cultists. There will probably be some villain monologuing, probably some zombie hordes, probably another named character death or two. Pretty standard issue. What Idon'texpect is for anyone to lovingly and accurately describe the process of refurbishing a guitar. And that's the other issue with putting this episode where it is—just as you're getting used to a show without Joel, you're reminded that he's missing all over again.

    "article_text": "After pictures of in-hand copies of Wizkids’ new pre-paintedÂBaldur’s Gate 3miniatures emerged andwere promptly ridiculedÂ last week, the toymaker has announced plans to offer complete refunds to players disappointed by the horrifying paint jobs that turned Faerun’s finest into eldritch abominations. The controversy around Wizkids’ new $50Icons of the Realms: Baldur’s Gate 3Âwent viral last week, when players who had pre-ordered the set of seven pre-painted miniatures of the main party from Larian’s hitÂD&Dvideo game found them arriving with almost comically bad paint applicationsâsignificantly worse than the production images used to sell the set promoted, which were themselves already significantly worse than the images used for the highly anticipated set’sreveal last year. Although no one expected seven mass-market miniatures to hit the quality of, say,a Golden Demon entrant, when Karlach’s eyes start slipping halfway down her face, Lae’zel’s hair is half Githyanki-skintone colored, and Gale looks more like aDollar Tree Matt Berry, something has gone clearly wrong. pic.twitter.com/pKkkroQrWt — Gale-LOD ð (@HighLODLar)May 13, 2025 Thankfully, Wizkids agrees. In a statement released to thecompany’s official websitetoday, Wizkids offered an apology for the quality of itsÂBaldur’s Gate 3minis. “As a company, WizKids seeks to create products that enhance and add to the enjoyment of game play. We want our customers to build long-lasting, fond memories around game nights with friends and family using our products,” the statement opens. “Unfortunately, we missed the mark on this goal with theD&D Icons of the Realms: Baldurâs Gate 3Character Boxed Set.” Wizkids will offer complete refunds to anyone who purchased the set directly from the company, but also offered that anyone who purchased the box set through their local game store can return it to point of purchase for a complete refund as well. Should anyone be brave enough to want a replacement instead, they can also fill outan online formto receive a set that Wizkids will “ensure that it meets the standards expected.” Wizkids has also removed theÂIcons of the Realmsetfrom its webstore, so anyone looking to try and buy a questionable piece ofBaldur’s Gate 3history might find themselves out of luck. “Please accept our sincerest apologies for the frustration and disappointment these quality issues caused our customers. We, too, feel the same as the final product did not meet our expectations or that of our Wizards of the Coast partner,” the statement concluded. “Our teams are working to find the best solutions to resolve this for all involved and to work with you, our customers, to fix this.” Hasbro’s broader stewardship ofÂBaldur’s Gate 3in the wake of Larian officially moving on from the game afterits latest patchhas been marked by a series of unfortunate public mishaps as it seeks to capitalize on the immense success of the 2023 smash hit. In a much less funny situation than badly painted miniatures, earlier this year Wizards of the Coast scrapped its much-vauntedvirtual tabletop project Sigil, which had extensively leveraged the ability to use characters likeÂBaldur’s Gate‘s Karlach and Astarion in promotional material.

    "title": "‘The Last of Us’ Will Need a 4th Season to Finish Its Story",
    "article_text": "Next season ofThe Last of Uswon’t be the last of it. In a new interview, the show’s co-creator Craig Mazinsaid that the upcoming third seasonof the show will not finish the story of the second video game,The Last of Us Part II. “Thereâs no way to complete this narrative in a third season,” Mazin said. “Hopefully, weâll earn our keep enough to come back and finish it in a fourth. Thatâs the most likely outcome.” The quote comes from an extensive interview withColliderwhere Mazin,ahead of the upcoming season two finale, spoke about working on the third season,which HBO officially greenlit a few weeks back. “It would take forever,” Mazin said about finishing the events of the second game in the third season. “There are natural perforations in the narrative where you can go, ‘Okay, letâs tear it here.’ I think thereâs a decent chance that season three will be longer than season two, just because the manner of that narrative and the opportunities it affords us are a little different. The thing about Joelâs death is that itâs so impactful. Itâs such a narrative nuclear bomb that itâs hard to wander away from it. We canât really take a break and move off to the side and do a Bill and Frank story. Iâm not sure that will necessarily be true for season three. I think weâll have a little more room there.” Audiences have not yet seen where season two ends, but it certainly seems to be aiming at one of the second game’s biggest “perforations” that Mazin mentions. Assuming the game’s big point of view shift is the end of this season, there is definitely a lot more story to go, but it’s a bit of a surprise to hear Mazin flat out say they don’t want to wrap it up next season. Thankfully, Mazin confirms that they don’t start writing anything untilânot just the upcoming season is planned, but even further in advance. “We always think ahead,” he said. “We thought ahead to season three and season four, to try to get as much visibility as we can, so that we donât end up in a situation where weâre sitting down and getting into details for a season and then going, ‘Oh, man, if only we hadnât had that person say that one line or be in that spot or wear that jacket, this would be so much cooler.’ So, we really do try to think things through fundamentally. The challenge for our first season was, how do we tell this big story in a way thatâs complete and doable within an amount of time and with the budget we have? And with this season, it was, ‘Okay, this source material goes way beyond one season.'” In fact, it might take three seasons. The season two finale ofThe Last of Usairs Sunday; we’ll have much more then. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "SAG-AFTRA Calls Out ‘Fortnite’ Over Darth Vader AI Voice",
    "article_text": "Imagine having the ability to make Darth Vader,Star Wars‘ most eloquent villain, say whatever you want him to say.Fortniteplayers have been having a blast doing just that since the feature was introduced. But now there’s controversy attached to this new iteration of the iconic characterâand it has nothing to do with him utteringtoo many f-bombs. Instead, it has to do with SAG-AFTRA’s prescribed procedure on the use of AI voices. In a post last week onFortnite’s websiteannouncing that players can now “strategize with the ultimate Sith Lord … and heâll respond back using conversational AI,” Epic Games is careful to note that this was only made possible by the express permission of the late, great James Earl Jones’ estate. “James Earl felt that the voice of Darth Vader was inseparable from the story ofStar Wars, and he always wanted fans of all ages to continue to experience it,” reads a statement attributed to Jones’ family. “We hope that this collaboration withFortnitewill allow both longtime fans of Darth Vader and newer generations to share in the enjoyment of this iconic character.” Talking directly to Darth Vaderâhe’s now a boss inBattle Royale, swapping in for the Samurai Vader that has been a part of the game’s ongoingStar Warseventâis indeed a cool opportunity for fans of Jones andStar Warsalike. But actors’ union SAG-AFTRA, which famously foregroundedthe use of AIas one of its key issuesduring the 2023 industry strikes, is now sayingFortnitedidn’t go through the proper channels before adding Darth Vader’s AI voice to the game. The union has now filed an unfair labor practice charge (link to the PDF is onthe SAG-AFTRA website) that calls out “Fortnite‘s signatory company, Llama Productions” for “[replacing] the work of human performers with AI technology” without “providing any notice of their intent to do this and without bargaining with us over appropriate terms.” The union notes that it’s not against the general idea here: “We celebrate the right of our members and their estates to control the use of their digital replicas and welcome the use of new technologies to allow new generations to share in the enjoyment of those legacies and renowned roles.” The problem is that the AI being used here makes human voice actors obsolete, and “we must protect our right to bargain terms and conditions around uses of voice that replace the work of our members, including those who previously did the work of matching Darth Vader’s iconic rhythm and tone in video games.” So far there’s been no response from Epic Games on the filing.The Hollywood Reporternotes that despite the SAG-AFTRA’s still-ongoingInteractive Media Agreement strike, which has been stuck for months on negotiating “AI protections for voice actors in video games,” actorscanactually work onFortnitewithout violating the strike, since the game falls under an exception for titles that were in production before August 2023.

    "title": "FEMA Shifts Disaster Burden to States in Wake of Deadly Tornadoes",
    "article_text": "As the U.S. South reels from a scourge of deadly tornadoes and braces for hurricane season, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) says it is shifting recovery responsibility to the states.Â During a staff town hall on Thursday, May 15, acting chief David Richardson said he will âreturn primacy to the statesâ in accordance with the Trump administrationâs plan to shift the agencyâs mission, Associated Press (AP)reports. This means states impacted by natural disasters will only receive federal assistance âwhen deemed necessary,â Richardson said. The move could drastically shrink the amount of aid states can get from FEMA. Richardson warned that traditional FEMA cost-sharing, which covers 75% of disaster recovery expenses, could change by this summer, according to AP.Â Jeremy Edwards, FEMA deputy director of public affairs during the Biden administration, told AP that while states typically lead disaster response, they rely on federal resources as needed, and not every state will be able to take on more responsibility. âItâs unclear what they mean when they say returning primacy to the states,â he said. âWhat does that mean when certain states donât have the resources in their own budgets to respond to and recover from catastrophic events?â The agencyâs announcement came just one day before severe storms whipped up multiple tornadoes across parts of the south-central U.S. last week. Now, residents of hard-hit Kentucky and Missouri are sifting through rubble, CBS Newsreports.Â Hundreds of homes were damaged and at least 27 people died. A preliminary estimate by AccuWeather puts the total cost of damages between $9 billion and $11 billion, according to an emailed statement.Â These states arenât out of the woods just yet. The National Weather Service (NWS)warnsthat a moderate risk of severe thunderstorms will remain for parts of the Midwest and Southeast until tonight. More tornadoes could form in some areas, in addition to damaging hail and winds.Â This multi-day severe weather event marks an active start to the 2025 disaster season, which will really get underway when the Atlantic hurricane season officially begins in about two weeks. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)plansto release its hurricane season outlook on Thursday. But experts have alreadypredicted17 named storms and nine hurricanes for this year, four of which could be major (Category 3 or above).Â For comparison, 2024 saw above-average storm activity in the Atlantic basin, with 18 named storms, 11 hurricanes, and five major hurricanes, according toNOAA. Five hurricanes made landfall in the continental U.S., and two hit as major hurricanes.Â FEMAâs policy change will put increased financial strain on states as they face what will likely be another active storm season. When asked how the change will impact federal relief for states hit by recent tornadoes, an agency spokesperson told Gizmodo thatâall operational and readiness requirements will continue to be managed without interruption in close coordination with local and state officials.â âUnlike the previous administrationâs unprepared, disgraceful and inadequate response to natural disasters like Hurricane Helene, the Trump administration is committed to ensuring Americans affected by emergencies will get the help they need in a quick and efficient manner,â the agency said.Â Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noemsaidin a Saturday evening statement that she spoke with the governors of Missouri, Kentucky, and Illinois âto offer federal resources and action for the deadly tornadoes and storms impactingâ those states.Â Noem and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth co-chair a FEMA review council that was established by President Donald Trump to recommend changes to the agency. FEMA has lost about 2,000 full-time employees since Trump took office in January, according to theNatural Resources Defense Council(NRDC). During Thursdayâs staff town hall, Richardson said additional staff cuts could come to fruition as more of the agencyâs functions are offloaded onto states, the AP reports.Â Such sweeping changes raise concerns about the agencyâs preparedness for fast-approaching Atlantic hurricane season. And yet, earlier this month, Reutersreportedthat Richardson told staff he would ârun right overâ anyone who stood in the way of his reforms.Â Â “Don’t get in my way… I know all the tricks,â he said.Â Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Second Latin American Influencer Gunned Down in Two Weeks",
    "article_text": "For the second time in two weeks, a young Latin American influencer has been shot to death. Just last week, 23-year-old Mexican influencer Valeria Marquez was killed during a livestream at her salon in Jalisco, Mexico. Not long afterward, 22-year-old Colombian model Maria Jose EstupiÃ±an was gunned down after opening the door for an assassin disguised as a delivery man. The two cases share some similarities beyond the targeting of young female models who promote themselves through social media. CNN reportsthat EstupiÃ±an was shot on May 15th after opening her door to a man who claimed to be delivering something to her apartment. Magda Victoria Acosta, the President of the National Gender Commission of the Colombian Judiciary, recently told reporters that EstupiÃ±an was about to receive 30 million pesos from a domestic violence case involving her ex-partner. Last week’s killing of Marquez had a major similarity to EstupiÃ±an’s case: Not long before the shooting, a masked person posing as a delivery man appeared at Marquez’s salon and said he had an “expensive gift” for her,Reuters reports. Marquez was not there at the time. After Marquez arrived and started streaming on TikTok, an unknown assailant pulled up on a motorbike outside the young model’s salon and began firing through the front window of her business, killing her. Marquez, who is said to have had nearly 200,000 followers on TikTok, could be heard saying “they’re coming” during the stream. A voice off camera then apparently said “Hey, Vale?” shortly before she was shot. Reuters also reports that, after she had been shot, a person appeared to “pick up her phone, with their face briefly showing on the livestream before the video ended.” Prosecutors in the case have said that they believe the men who targeted Marquez were likely assassins. “The aggressor arrived asking if the victim (MÃ¡rquez) was there. So it appears he didn’t know her,” RodrÃ­gueztold reporters. “With that, you can deduce â without jumping to conclusions â that this was a person who was paid. It was obviously someone who came with a purpose.” Marquez even apparently expressed concern during her livestream that she would be murdered. “Maybe they were going to kill me,” she said in the video minutes before she was killed. “Were they going to come and take me away, or what? I’m worried.” CrimeinfluencersTikTok Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. News from the future, delivered to your present.

    "title": "I Don’t Know How to Talk About This Episode of ‘Doctor Who’ Without Losing My Mind",
    "article_text": "A lot happened on this week’sÂDoctor Who. It feels almost impossible to articulate justÂhow muchall that “how much” wasâand how much of it was questionable at best, and perhaps wildly poorly thought out at worstâwithout just vomiting a quick, high-concept summation of what happens in “The Interstellar Song Contest.” There is aEurovision Song Contest But In Space, hosted by a TV host almost 100% of audiences outside of the UK are going to be baffled at the Doctor and Belinda’s obsession with, and a cat lady who speaks French.One hundred thousand people are graphically sucked into space. They’re fine. An incredibly fraught “what if both sides maybe made some mistakes” allegory about a fictional genocide plays out in an episode that is broadcasting, intentionally, the same night of the actual 2025 Eurovision Song Contest, a cultural event that has faced two consecutive years of protests and controversy over the participation of Israel, a country in the process of conducting agenocidal invasion of Palestineâan event thatDoctor Whostar Ncuti Gatwabacked out ofrepresenting the UK’s televote results for at the last minute. The Doctor does some mild torturing while lecturing the victim of the aforementioned genocide that revenge is bad, actually, and is only lightly chastised by his companion. Also, Carol Ann Ford is here reprising her role as Susan,Doctor Who‘s very first companion and the Doctor’s own granddaughter, by occasionally showing up in the Doctor’s mind to do her best impression of a vision of the Lady Galadriel inÂThe Lord of the Rings.ÂAlso, also, it turns out that Mrs. Flood is an incarnation of the Rani, a high-camp irregular Time Lady villainess from 1980sDoctor Who, and having been mortally wounded in the whole aforementioned “one hundred thousand people are graphically sucked into space, wait, they’re fine” incident, shebi-regenerates into a new incarnationthat immediately despises her former self. Did we get all that? Suffice to say, “The Interstellar Song Contest” has an issue with tonal variance that undermines much of what the episode is trying to say, even if, ultimately, what it’s trying to say about its allegorical underpinnings is tantamount to a half-hearted shrug.Doctor Wholoves itself a bit of tonal variance: arguably the show is at its best when it can be making you laugh at high-camp shenanigans one moment, and then be terrified the next. But what is so jarring throughout “The Interstellar Song Contest,” putting aside its allegorical pitfalls for a moment, is that its tonal clash rarely feels like a point the episode wants to engage with as it bizarrely jumps between the gravity of the situation (well, the “mavity,” thanks to the return of that joke, although again, it feels kind of out of place when people are saying it about trying to save 100,000 concert attendees who just got sucked into the vacuum of space) and the zillion other things pinging around in its proverbial head. Actually, really, you can’t talk about the tonal weirdness of this episode without engaging what the episode presents itself as saying more broadly being about beneath the high-glitz facade of its Eurovision knockoff, so we might as well get into that. The inciting incident at the crux of “The Interstellar Song Contest” is that its setting, an interstellar space stadium, the Harmony Arena, is overtaken by two rogue members of a species of horned beings called the Hellions, Kid (Freddie Fox) and his girlfriend/person-on-the-inside, a broadcast operator named Wynn (Iona Anderson). Kid and Wynn are committing this slaughterâfirst of the attendees of the contest, and then, through highjacking the broadcast with a weaponized high-intensity signal called a Delta Wave (itself a reference to the same technology the Doctor was going to try and kill a Dalek fleet with in “The Parting of the Ways”), the murder of trillions of people watching all over the galaxyâas an act of vengeance for the invasion, and slaughtering of, their homeworld Hellia by the Corporation, the contest’s primary financial sponsor. The vast scale of the death at stake in the episodeâfor a good chunk of it, the separated Doctor and Belinda both believe the other died in the spacing of the attending crowdsâamid the scenery of a cheesy, sparkly, and camp setting should provide the kind of interplayDoctor Whoexcels in striking a balance between. But as the Doctor makes clear that he is not only going to stop Kid, but that he outright hates himâunlike anything we’ve seen this incarnation of the Doctor hate beforeâfor what he’s trying to justify, the parallels of what “The Interstellar Song Contest” and the context at which it is playing out in our real world becomes increasingly murky. The Doctor saves all of his hatred in this episode for Kid, even after learning that the Corporation’s systematic occupation and exploitation of Hellia is not just real, but has led to the Hellions’ broad persecution across the galaxy, and never saves a moment of his fury for the system that pushed Hellions like Kid and Wynn to such violent action in the first place, or that forced the Hellion songstress Cora (Miriam-Teak Lee) into hiding to the point of mutilation in an attempt to assimilate. Things take a further turn when the Doctor eventually does catch up with Kid and stops the Delta Wave’s activation, as he proceeds to vent his anger on Kid in an extended torture sequence. It is a moment that is presented in equal parts horrifying, and in some ways justified by the Doctor. “How many people did you want to kill, three trillion?” the Doctor vengefully growls at Kid as he delivers multiple, excruciating electric shocks to the Hellion. “How about we tryÂthis, three trillion times?” Not even the vision of Susan in his head is enough to stop the Doctor from electrocuting Kid well beyond the point of incapacitation. It’s only Belinda showing up and being horrified at what he’s doing that makes him stop long enough for Kid and Wynn to be detained, and even then the Doctor makes clear that if he ever meets Kid again, he will not be able to stop himself from acting in such a similar way, that he has in part been irrevocably changed for the worse by Kid’s attempted actions. And if that wasn’t enough, the episode then initially closes on Belindaâa character introduced with calling him out on his bullshit as a defining trait in her relationship with the Doctorâtacitly walking back her disgust with the Doctor’s behavior, instead having a brief “whoa that was scary, anyway let’s get on with it” conversation. What the Doctor makes clear, whatDoctor Whomakes clear, in this moment, is that that can never be any justification for a violent response to oppression, lest that oppressed party face his full and complete wroth. There is no middle ground between the murder of trillions of people and taking the Corporation to task for its ravaging of Hellia to be found here. The only response that is justified in the episode’s eyes in Cora’s revelation to the public that she is in fact a Hellion when the contest resumes in the episode’s final act, singing a mournful native ballad to the eventual applause of the crowd. It is participation in, rather than a rejection of, the system that exploited and oppressed her people that “The Interstellar Song Contest” thematically ends this arc on, and we as the audience are left to imagine if it was effective in aiding the plight of Hellia or not, rather than the episode actually taking a definitive stance on that. It’s hypocritical considering the Doctor themselves is responsible for the deaths of a countless number of races, deaths that are always justified as retribution in the name of a greater good or against a greater injustice. But what makes this being the thematic message of “The Interstellar Song Contest” feel so heinous is the explicit intention to have this episode release alongside the actual Eurovision Song Contest. It may be considered unfair to frame this episode in the context of the current version of EurovisionâJuno Dawson’s script for this episode was written at least over a year ago, and production on this season ofDoctor Whohad already begun in the immediate wake of the October 7 attacks that led to the Israeli invasion of Palestine, by which point thousands of people had already died. Both this and last year’s Eurovision contests were subject to protests and boycotts of Israeli participation (the country was the first non-European participant in Eurovision when it began competing in 1971), all of which occurred throughout the creation and production of this episode. Many, many more have died in the time since, accusations ofcrimes against humanityand acts of genocide by bodies around the world have only continued to mount. There has beentimeto reconsider this story, at every step of the way, and insteadÂDoctor Whowent forward with itâand wanted to invite direct parallels, otherwise it wouldn’t have so specifically placed this episode in the run of the season directly alongside the broadcast of Eurovisionâand went forward with it in a manner that instead presented a fence-sitting allegory for the audience to come down on one interpretation or the other of rather than saying anything with teeth itself. There are ways you could read “The Interstellar Song Contest” as framing Israel’s actions since October 7 as unjustifiableâthe real Eurovision has been partially sponsored by theIsraeli-owned cosmetics company Moroccanoilfor several years, a parallel to the Corporation’s sponsorship of the ISC, although the episode implies that the Corporation is a significantly more influential sponsor than that real-world parallel. But equally in turn the episode can, through the extremity of Kid’s plan, be seen as saying that any violent resistance to genocide is similarly unjustified. It’s not the first time this new era ofDoctor Whohas struggled to take an effectively clear stance on a serious messageâlast year’s “Dot and Bubble”saved revealing its own racism allegory until its final moments,this year’s “Lucky Day”muddled a message about conspiracy theories in a defence of unequivocal trust of the state. For all the criticism from right-leaning circles that this era ofDoctor Whoissupposedly too “woke”, it’s an era that, in reality, has consistently struggled to actually engage with progressive values beyond a surface level when it matters the most, inviting itself to interpretation and critiques, in ways positive and negative, that co-existÂ  because the material itself lacks clarity on its thematic position. But an at-best-mild admonishment of the Doctor’s actions and a vague hope that Cora’s song might change things for the better isn’t actually where “The Interstellar Song Contest” leaves things, as if all that wasn’t enough. After the Doctor and his allies manage to successfully save and revive the 100,000 concertgoers left freezing in space for much of the episode (hand-waved in a sequence set to “Making Your Mind Up,” the Eurovision-winning 1981 pop song by UK group Bucks Fizz, because, again, this episode loves awildswing in tone), a post-credit sequence reveals that the final revived victim is none other than Mrs. Flood, who had been spying on the Doctor and Belinda during the contest. Declaring the incident as an unfortunately mortal wound, Flood then casually reveals to the audience and confounded onlookers alike that she is in fact a Time Lady, and prepares to regenerate. Only, shebi-generates, splitting off into her Flood incarnation and her next form as the latest iteration of the Rani, now portrayed by Archie Panjabi, but having been played by the late Kate O’Mara across her appearances in two classicDoctor Whoserials, “The Mark of the Rani” and “Time and the Rani,” as well as the1993 charity specialÂDimensions in Time. O’Mara’s performance as the Raniâa morally unscrupulous renegade scientist who specializes in horrific genetic experimentation on her subjects, willing or otherwiseâhas been embraced in the years since her appearances as something ofa camp icon, from the Rani’s glorious fashion sense to her scenery-chewing declarations of her cackling villainy (please revisit her arguably most iconic line from “Time and the Rani”, “Leave the girl: it’s theman I want!”here, for evidence). On the one hand, this makes her long-awaited, and often long-joked-about, return in modernDoctor Whoa rare moment where “The Interstellar Song Contest” actively and engages with its broader tone in a fun way: there’s arguably no better place for the Rani to return than in a queer-coded romp set at faux-Eurovision that, poorly or otherwise, engages with a dark heart at its core. But on the other, the climax ofÂDoctor Who‘s arc with Mrs. Flood, which has been in play since the very beginning of Gatwa’s tenure as the Doctor, culminating with Flood herself sticking around to be a comedically simpering helpless foil to her next self feelsbizarre. Flood has, for better or worse, been somethingDoctor Whohas constantly reminding us that it’s building toward, her regular appearances throughout the last two seasons treading a peculiar line between seemingly pointless beyond existing to tease, and at times, outright negatively impacting the rest of an episode’s narrative. If where that was all going was just going to culminate with setting up what is ultimately an obvious return (people have speculated that Flood could be the Rani ever since it became clear she was set up for something more), depending on how the remaining two episodes of the season play out, renders all that build up even more pointless as it has often felt. Putting aside that half of the Rani reveal, even then what’s fun about the Rani is that she’s kind of cheesy, hence the aforementioned camp embrace. She’s a little menacing, sure, but she’s mostly beloved for her plans not exactly being series-finale-level, fate-of-all-reality stakes, and she’s arguably as beloved for comically failing to execute those plans than as she is for being a capital-V-Villain. Time will tell if making her the architect of a climactic grand finale years in the teasing will match up to what people loved about her in the first place, but in an episode that is all over the place with the ideas it’s playing with, throwing her in as a final “one more thing” might end up being even more thematically appropriate to its tonal messiness if things don’t live up to expectation. Even if they don’t, it still remains that that final reveal is going to be what “The Interstellar Song Contest” will be remembered for, rather than its grave misgivings elsewhere. Perhaps that is, at the end of the day, also its point: after all, why not embrace spectacle to distract yourself from having something meaningful to say? Want more io9 news?

And John Wick could go to China on his next ass-kicking adventure. If the first reactions to the 'Lilo & Stitch' remake are any indication, Disney may have another hit on their hands. After years of being overworked, VFX artists for Marvel, Disney, and the 'Avatar' movies have secured better conditions going forward. A new report suggests that a brief hiatus may set the stage for the next chapter of 'Doctor Who' in 2027âbut it's a chapter that will happen regardless of whatever decision Disney makes over its deal with the BBC. The move comes after the legendary 'Star Wars' voice actor sold the rights to his voice to AI firm Respeecher before his death.

    "title": "Razer Thins Out the Blade 14 and Fattens the Price Tag",
    "article_text": "The newly announcedRazer Blade 14isn’t quite stiletto-thin, but it’s becoming far more knife-like over time. Compared topast iterations, the shell is now as tall as 10 pennies stacked on top of each other, which means the new blade might be as thin as your wallet after buying one. On top of being the thinnest Blade 14 Razer has ever made, it’s also the most expensive, starting at $2,300 for a version with Nvidiaâs new GeForce RTX 5060 laptop GPU. Razerâs always tried to offer quality for its high price, but withtariffs in effect, the new Blade 14 is pushing what consumers can expect from gaming laptops. The Blade 14âs base price is $100 more than you would have paid for the 2024 Blade 14 with an RTX 4060. If you upgrade the new Blade to the version with the RTX 5070, Razer told us you could spend $2,700 for the sake of a laptop thatâs ânot a big brick,â as the company put it. Razer is always an enticing buy because of its generally strong build quality, but even a frisbee-light frame doesn’t take the sting out of today’stariff-inflated product prices. Razerâs new ultra-thin design houses an AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 and up to 64GB of 8,000MHz LPDDR5X RAM. It’s the first time Razer is pairing a Copilot+ CPU made for lightweight laptops with an Nvidia GPU in a thoroughbred gaming machine, which means it’s compatible withWindows 11 AI features like Recall(which you shouldprobably remember to turn offduring setup). The laptop sports a bevy of ports, including HDMI and a microSD card slot. As per usual, Razer promotes its hardy aluminum with an anodized black finish that will manage to stave off bumps or blemishes. We donât doubt that all that combined will offer enough juice to showcase the Blade 14âs 3K, 120Hz OLED display. We do wonder what kind of CPU performance it might provide compared to a similarly sized laptop like theAsus TUF Gaming A14and its top-end AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370. Asusâ older model also costs hundreds of dollars less than Razerâs latest. Razer promised you’ll get 2 to 3 hours while gaming on the 72WHr battery. That doesnât sound like much, but it’s technically better than what you already get on theRazer Blade 16from this year. Weâve yet to find a gaming laptop with a battery life that will keep up for extended periods. The Blade 14 powers the RTX 5070 up to the max 115W TGP, which may give you enough juice for most modern games at the max 2,880 x 1,800 resolution. TheRTX 5060 laptop GPUis still so new, we donât yet know how it performs compared to Nvidiaâs mid-range graphics options. No matter which GPU you choose, the machine will still support a six-speaker system through upward-firing speakers. That may offer better sound quality than you may be used to on such small systems, especially with support for THX Spatial Audio. There has been a rash of relatively light gaming laptops from 2024 stretching into this year. Razer seemingly knew it needed to step up its game with the 2025 edition of the Blade 14. At 0.62-inch thickness and weighing in at 3.59 pounds, it’s 11% thinner and lighter than the 2024 edition. It takes the same thermal hood design from this year’s rendition of the Blade 16. That laptop also went on a diet for the sake of customers who want a less hefty device to fit a little bit better in their backpacks. We found it also tended to get rather hot when playing intensive games, so we hope thatâs less of a problem with a smaller battery and less demanding GPU. The one thing that hasnât been brought over from the Blade 16 is the improved keyboard. Itâs a Razer device, so of course itâs packed to the gills with gamer lights, including per-key RGB. Those keys still only have 1 mm of key travel compared to the deeper, more impactful 1.5mm on the redesigned 16-incher. There are no color options save for black and white, as much as we might beg Razer to bring back the âcoralâ pink color from the 2019 Razer Blade Stealth. Thereâs nothing wrong with a thin system, but perhaps a pink blade would help take away the sting of price hikes.

    "title": "Why That Major ‘Last of Us’ Reveal Happened So Soon",
    "article_text": "In a way,this week’s episode ofThe Last of Usspoiled the end of the game. It took a key scene between Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) that originally came at the very end ofThe Last of Us Part IIand moved it into the middle of the story. And, while you’d thinka decision that majorwould’ve been a big challenge, the people behind it claim it was easier than expected. In this week’s sixth episode ofThe Last of Usseason two, “The Price,” we got to see the key moment where Joel finally tells Ellie the truth about what happened at the end of the first season. He killed an entire hospital of people who probably could’ve created a cure to the apocalyptic viral outbreak, just so Ellie wouldn’t have to die. And then he lied about it. It’s the lie that hangs over the entire story of the second game, and this season of the showâbut while that conversation comes at the very end of the video game, we got to see it much earlier on the show.Speaking to Variety, the game’s creator, and episode six director, Neil Druckmann explained that moving the scene up was not a difficult decision to make. “When we were making the game, I knew that scene should exist. I didnât know where it goes. That was true for all the flashbacks. Even pretty late in production of the game, we were moving those flashbacks around,” Druckmann said. “In talking about it with Craig [Mazin, series co-creator], itâs the first time I really thought about the time between seasons. So much of writing is set-ups and payoffs, and we would have set certain things up that get paid off years later. That felt too long, especially because this season focuses so much on Ellieâs journey and this emotional truth of what did she know? What didnât she know? To wait additional years until season three will come outâor maybe even season four, it depends where all the events land and how many seasons we haveâI was easily convinced by Craig that that would be too long.” Yes, let’s acknowledge that Druckmann did just tease that season three ofThe Last of Usmay not be the end. We think it will be, but that is something he said. Adding more context to the decision, though,Collider spoke toHalley Gross, who co-wroteThe Last of Us Part IIas well as “The Price.” Gross talked about not just the decision to move Joel and Ellie’s conversation up, but that it erases an entire scene from the game where Ellie travels to Salt Lake City and learns the truth for herself. “When you’re talking about TV, we have to condense themes. We have to think about sets. We have to think about Ellie and Joel’s progress not in a 24-hour game, but in a 55-minute piece,” Gross said. “There was an opportunity to hit both of those notes at the same time because of this Eugene moment, because Eugene was giving us the confirmation that that hospital beat was originally intended for. So, once Ellie knows in the same way that she knew when she visited St. Mary’s, then it becomes: how are you going to move forward from that information?” Druckmann confirms that it was the crafting of the scene where Joel kills Eugene, which isn’t in the game, that gave them the okay to skip the extra Salt Lake City trip and make that the moment Ellie knows for sure what Joel did. “We wanted this episode for Ellie to find out definitively that Joel lied,” Druckmann said. “In the game, we did in a very different way, where she traveled all the way back to the hospital and found documentation. It felt like we would be stretching the reality of the world and how dangerous it is on the show compared to the game. But also, looking at documents and exploring that space, I donât know if that makes as compelling of a drama for a TV show. The engine for the show is a little different than the engine for an interactive experience. So that ultimately led to the whole Eugene sequence.” Now though, withThe Last of Usseason two altering some of the emotional payoffs at the very end ofThe Last of Us Part II, does that mean Druckmann and Mazin have to rethink exactly how the show is going to end? “That’s right,” he begrudgingly admitted to Variety. The first six episodes ofThe Last of Usseason two are now on HBO Max. The season finale airs Sunday. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Record-Breaking Fusion Lab More Than Doubles Its 2022 Energy Breakthrough",
    "article_text": "The worldâs only fusion experiment that actually gives back more energy than it takes in is now breaking its own records. According toTechCrunch, the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory recently pushed its fusion yieldâfirst to 5.2 megajoules, and then to 8.6 megajoulesâmore than doubling the energy released in itshistoric shot in 2022. That original breakthrough was the first time scientists had ever achieved âignitionââa fusion reaction that generated more energy (3.15 megajoules) than the lasers put into the fuel (2.05 megajoules). Importantly, that achievement does not take into account the amount of energy put into the system to power the reactionâessentially, 300 megajoules of energy from the plug in the wall. Nevertheless, the accomplishment indicated the tantalizing promise of nuclear fusion as a carbon-free, essentially limitless source of energy. Jill Hruby, the under secretary for nuclear security, summed it up as âthe first tentative steps towards a clean energy source that could revolutionize the world.â Fusion isnât newâscientists have been chasing it for nearly a century. The problem has always been scale: It generally costs way more energy to trigger a fusion reaction than what comes out of said reaction. The NIFâs achievement changed thatâfor a moment, humanity replicated the energy source of stars and came out ahead. The new surge in energy yield is a large jump for the experiment, though it’s still very far off from providing a sustainable clean energy source (consider the 300 megajoules necessary to power the 2022 experiment). And that’s to say nothing of building an actual fusion energy plant, and figuring out a way to produce fusion power at scale and integrate the budding technology into the world’s power grid. The system works via inertial confinement fusion, using 192 laser beams to compress a diamond-coated pellet the size of a peppercornâbasically giving it a tiny, star-like explosion inside a golden cylinder. The laser blast occurs inside a 10-meter-wide vacuum chamber, heating the fuel to over 100 million degrees Fahrenheit and pressures hundreds of billion of times Earthâs atmosphere. The team repeated the trick in2023, and by the recent report, it seems the experiment’s efficiency has only improved. Experts still see big roadblocks for inertial confinement as a practical energy source. That’s why other teams are pursuing other means of fusionânamely magnetic confinement, which uses magnetic fields to hold plasmaâto prove that pathway to clean energy. Other projects like ITERâa massive tokamak under construction in Franceâareattempting to generaterecord amounts of energy output, though they will never be part of the energy grid. Still, fusionâs long-held reputation as a pipe dreamâ”always 30 years away”âmight finally be changing.

    "title": "‘Free Palestine’ Protester Interrupts Satya Nadella During Microsoft’s Build Conference",
    "article_text": "Shortly after Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella took the stage at the company’s annual Microsoft Build developer’s conference, an employee interrupted the speech by shouting âFree Palestineâ and demanding accountability from the CEO for the company’s work with the Israeli government. “How about you show ’em how Microsoft is killing Palestinians? How about you show ’em how Israeli war crimes are powered by Azure?” the employee yelled from the audience before being confronted and dragged away by security. “As a Microsoft worker, I refuse to be complicit in this genocide,” he said as he was escorted from the room. View this post on Instagram The employee is Joe Lopez, a four-year veteran of Microsoft’s Azure hardware systems team,according to The Verge. Shortly after his in-person protest, Lopez sent an email to thousands of Microsoft employees, The Verge reported, condemning the company’s leadership for continuing to work with the Israeli government despite its ongoing attacks that havekilled tens of thousands of civilians in Gaza. âLeadership rejects our claims that Azure technology is being used to target or harm civilians in Gaza,â Lopez wrote, per The Verge. âThose of us who have been paying attention know that this is a bold-faced lie. Every byte of data that is stored on the cloud (much of it likely containing data obtained by illegal mass surveillance) can and will be used as justification to level cities and exterminate Palestinians.â The message refers to Microsoft’s recentstatementthat, after an internal review, it found no evidence that the Israeli military has used Azure or the company’s AI technology to target or harm Palestinian civilians in Gaza. That statement was issued after several other recent disruptions from anti-genocide protesters. At one event, a Microsoft employee stood up and called Microsoftâs AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman a âwar profiteer.” At another event, an employeedisrupted an on-stage conversationbetween Satya Nadella, Steve Ballmer, and Bill Gates, demanding the company “cut ties with Israel.” No Azure for Apartheidappears to have organized all of the disruptions, including the one today at Build. The group is made up of current Microsoft employees who want the company to terminate all contracts with the Israeli military and government. The group has aseries of ongoing planned actionsto display their objection to the company’s continued business with the country that has been found bymultiplehuman rightsorganizationsÂ to be committing a genocide. Despite Microsoft’s claims that its technology has not been used in Israel’s destructive and deadly attacks on Gaza, an investigation conducted by Israeli publication +972 MagazinefoundMicrosoft has a âfootprint in all major military infrastructuresâ in Israel, and sales of its AI and cloud services to Israel have increased since Israel started its onslaught in Gaza. Areport from the Associated Pressfurther confirmed that Israel has used AI models, including those from Microsoft, in warfare.

    "title": "Here’s Why You Can’t See Arnold Schwarzenegger Riding a Giant Dinosaur",
    "article_text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger, on top of a giant dinosaur, massive gun in hand, shooting Nazis.It was footage that launched a thousand blog postsacross the internet. Leaked footage, in fact, from a movie calledKung Fury 2which, despite being filmed in 2019 and also featuringMichael Fassbenderas a cocky, over-the-top supercop, has never been released. But that’s not because audiences aren’t ready for all thatArnold awesomeness.It’s because of money. Isn’t it always? In a new interview withVariety,Kung Fury 2star, writer, and director David Sandberg details multiple lawsuits that continue to plague the film, now over five years later. Those center mainly on Creasun Entertainment USA, the U.S. branch of a Chinese film company called Creasun Media. In 2019, Creasun signed on to help finance two-thirds ofKung Fury 2, including about $10 million in visual effects work from the company Double Negative. Production went fine, but then something changed. âOnce we started getting to VFX, things started to really slow down, and things became a bit weird,â Sandberg said. âAnd then it turned out that our Chinese financier had basically stopped all payments.â A lawsuit was filed and, after about a year and a half, a settlement was reached in which Creasun was going to pay what it owed. But, apparently, that still didn’t happen. So Creasun was sued again, but it didn’t stop there. Creasun filed countersuits accusing producers of stealing money from the production. Sandberg says that isn’t true, and Variety reports some of the other producers on the film tried to buy Creasun out. It declined. âThey just kind of stonewalled every single attempt to solve the issue,â he said. âAnd it was just really heartbreaking for me as an artist whoâs worked on this for years. And there are so many people who have poured their hearts into this, and I feel super terrible for them.â And so the slow legal process continues, ensuring that despite principal photography being complete, as well as an edit of the movie, between $5 and $10 million of visual effects remain unfinished. In fact, the footage that leaked earlier this month had temporary effects, which were never supposed to be seen by the public. âItâs a fantastic movie and Iâm so bummed that I canât show it,â Sandberg said. âBut I havenât given up on it. One day, for sure, it will get released. But we just have to power through it. But itâs incredible. Fassbender is incredible. Arnold is incredible. We had such a wonderful experience on set and everyone felt the love behind it. So itâs just a shame that it would end up this way. But itâs not over. It will get out there eventually.â Read more from Sandberg, including some teases of the movie he’s been making as theKung Fury 2legal battle continues to play out,over at Variety.

    "article_text": "I love Labyrinth of the Demon King go play Labyrinth of the Demon King. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Survival horror dungeon crawlerLabyrinth of the Demon Kingis neck-and-neck with Avowed and Oblivion Remastered as my personal game of the year so far, which I absolutely did not expect when I loaded it up on my Steam Deck before a flight (I ended up playing it all five hours). But even more surprising is that its small development team is already promising new additions just a week after launch. First up, Labyrinth of the Demon King is getting a selection of tweaks and bug fixes in itsfirst update: All good stuff, but what's really exciting is a preview of something just over the horizon: A new spiked knuckle weapon that feels like a perfect addition to Demon King's gritty, first-person melee combat. In addition to Labyrinth of the Demon King's stifling horror atmosphere, the game has some of the best first-person brawling I've seen in years. It's slow-paced, brutal, and extremely challenging, tied to an unforgiving stamina system that regenerates at a snail's pace, more akin to other games' mana bars than the rapidly regenerating endurance of Dark Souls or The Elder Scrolls. A pair of Shinobi-flavored spiked knuckles slots into a relatively underserved niche in Labyrinth of the Demon King's arsenal. They'll be the first \"fist\" weapons in the game, and one of very few fast-attacking options alongside a surreptitious tanto. On my next playthrough, though, I'll still be sticking with thecursed blood katana forged out of the broken bladeyou start the game with. PCG Australia editor Shaun Prescott praised the game as \"the most potent weird horror we're likely to see in 2025\" in his81% review of Labyrinth of the Demon King, and you can get it at a launch discount for $15 (as opposed to a usual $20) until May 27 onSteam. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "This hardcore driving sim about rebuilding towns after natural disasters is, surprisingly, a super-chill hangout game for up to 4 friends",
    "article_text": "There's a lot of work to do, but RoadCraft never feels like a stick-in-the-mud. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I'm not much of a driving enthusiast, so I steered clear of Saber Interactive's Mudrunner in 2017 and flaked out playing on Snowrunner in 2020. I like games where you do simulated jobs, though, and that's what got me interested inRoadCraft, Saber's new sim where industrial zones have been devastated by natural disasters and there's only one way to set things right: by sending in a bunch of big ol' trucks. But there's way more to RoadCraft than just crafting roads: you've gotta rebuild bridges, haul cargo, mend pipelines and lay powerlines, and even harvest resources like timber and scrap metal to be manufactured into new products for the repair effort. I know that sounds like it's a lot of slow, muddy, methodical work. And it is! But so far (I'm only on the third of eight maps in the full game) RoadCraft is also surprisingly chill and a great way to spend time with some friends in co-op. Incursion into the disaster zones usually begins by driving a scouting vehicle that can navigate muddy and fractured roads to find a relatively safe route to factories, garages, and other locations that have become stranded like islands in a sea of fallen trees and muddy trails. With a route established, you can plot a course on the map for autonomous vehicles to follow to deliver supplies, and then adjust that route when the CPU-controlled drivers inevitably get stuck along the way. To make things easier for your fleet and yourself, it's time to engage in the prophesied crafting of roads. You can fill in broken roadways with sand via dumptruck, flatten the sand with a bulldozer, and then even cover it in asphalt with a paver and roller so it's a proper road and not just a slightly less muddy dirt pile. From your established base, you then explore deeper into the map and tread a path to new locations and objectives: haul concrete slabs needed to repair a bridge, operate a giant crane to move debris, or lay powerlines to replace broken connections between utility buildings. This all takes two things: lots of time and big-ass trucks. There are side objectives, too, if you want to spend more time building and repairing instead of just rushing off to the next map. And if you're playing co-op, there are plenty of other objectives you can invent yourself, like seeing if you can pick up your friends' vehicles with a crane while they're driving them. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. You can. Morgan carried my scout around with his crane truck, and then I tried using my crane truck to pick up both Morgan and Lincoln's vehicles at the same time. I didn't quite succeed in that one. At times RoadCraft requires precision: I thought I could sloppily load a cargo truck with steel beams and concrete slabs, but the physics of my poorly loaded truck meant it kept tipping over on the drive so I had to repeatedly and laboriously swap to my bulldozer and drive along the same route to push my truck back up on its four wheels. It took ages. Mostly, though, RoadCraft feels downright forgiving. While craning a huge pipe into place on a broken pipeline, I only needed to get a portion of my replacement pipe in the right spot for the game to snap it perfectly into place. Also, muddy as those roads are, I don't think I've ever gotten truly stuck to the point where I needed to reset my vehicle back to the garage. Morgan, who put hundreds of hours into Snowrunner, says mud is not as cruel a nemesis in Roadcraft, especially since new support vehicles function as mobile respawn points. What's more common is, while trying to avoid a section of mud, I drive over some rough terrain and wind up rolling my truck. And for a game about toiling in a disaster zone, RoadCraft is amazingly chill. It's a great hangout game: tackling objectives with Morgan was low stress, and even playing on my own never felt frustrating, as I was sort of expecting considering the reputations of the earlier 'runner games. Operating certain trucks is a bit tricky due to all the different control options (cranes, particularly, require the memorization of two modifier keys to operate), but with a bit of practice it's a breeze. This might not be the news hardcare driving fans want to hear. I found myself a little disappointed (in the early maps, at least) that building a new bridge simply consisted of dropping concrete slabs into a highlighted area rather than craning sections into place individually. I also understand earlier games like Snowrunner required you to manage your vehicles' fuel and durability, almost like a survival game. That's not necessary here: trucks are always fully fuelled and completely invulnerable. That doesn't mean RoadCraft is easy, especially when playing solo, which requires a lot of slow driving with multiple vehicles. Take this one mission where I had to complete all of these steps to satisfy a single objective: It was slow work, and every out-of-place rock that wedged under my tire threatened to flip the truck and lose progress, but it was honestly a great, relaxing way to spend a couple hours. Completing it also let me afford a cargo/crane combo truck, so now I can pick stuff up and transport it with a single vehicle: that saved me a ton of time in the next map I played, which required me to collect a huge gas tank from one location and install it somewhere else. Feels weird to say it, but if you're looking for a completely chill game, consider this sim about bringing services to towns that have been devastated by floods and earthquakes. It's muddy in there, sure, but you'll spend most of your time relaxing, not spinning your wheels. RoadCraft releases May 20 onSteam.

    "title": "Remembering The Witcher 3's toughest choices (and the objectively correct answers)",
    "article_text": "Even in an RPG full of dicey outcomes, these moments in The Witcher 3 still stand out. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I remember how little time it took—just a few hours, really—for me to realize thatThe Witcher 3was treating quests differently than any other RPG I'd played. In so many games, particularly ones released before The Witcher 3 in 2015, there's a clear distinction in complexity and production value between the main quest and sidequests. Even when veering off the critical path involved something more complicated than killing a dozen enemies and bringing them back to a nameless villager, the very best sidequests in the RPGs I'd played from Bethesda and Bioware and Square Enix rarely measured up to the storiesCD ProjektRed was working into its least essential missions. Romantic tragedies in random Velen villages; murder mysteries in the heart of Novigrad; contracts that end up leading to haunted houses or Geralt on trial in front of a tribunal of monsters. Some of the quests that The Witcher 3 casually offers on a notice board in some muddy shithole town rival the pinnacle of other RPGs' storytelling. The thing most of these quests have in common is a critical choice of some kind: not a choice that influences the ending, or gives Geralt a few points on a \"good\" or \"evil\" progress bar, as Mass Effect had been doing in the years prior. The Witcher 3's writing has been praised many times over the last decade for being \"morally gray,\" but all that really means is that there isn't always (or maybe even ever) a right or wrong decision. It's not up to us to define who Geralt is—he's already the Butcher of Blaviken, Yennefer's on-off lover, Ciri's adoptive father. But we do get to color him in, all of his nuance flowing from hundreds of minor dialogue options and paths chosen. Is he a stern or gentle father? Does he fiercely stand up for persecuted dwarves and elves or avert his eyes? What regrets does he carry with him from the decisions he made when the outcomes were bad and worse? The Witcher 3's greatest trick was making these choices feel like they mattered to Geralt, and to us, without anything so obvious as a branching path or a pop-up saying \"Geralt will remember this.\" So it felt only right that as we celebrate The Witcher 3's 10th anniversary to look back at some of the hard decisions that have stuck with me. At the time I struggled with every one of these, but with hindsight I'm now prepared to tell you the Obviously and Objectively Correct decision in each scene. (Forget all that morally grey stuff from a second ago! This is how you mold the One True Geralt). Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Objectively correct choice:\"I still love you, too.\" What makes it agonizing?The Witcher 1 & 2 building up Geralt's relationship with Triss. What choices are harder than matters of the heart? The Last Wish is one ofThe Witcher 3's best quests, unfurling the long and stormy history of Geralt and Yennefer's romance from the Witcher novels. They don't know if their bond is due to a wish Geralt made to a powerful djinn, or if they're truly in love—and this quest lets you decide one way or the other. It's one of the most poignant scenes in the game, elegantly staged with Yen and Geralt sitting on the edge of a ship that's been magically transported to the top of a mountain, pouring out their hearts with just the wind between them. If you only know Geralt's story from the games, you've likely romanced Triss Merigold before this point. The first time I played The Witcher 3 I broke up with Yen at the end of The Last Wish, choosing the option \"Sorry, but I don't want to be with you anymore.\" But the more history you have with these characters, the more likely you are to see Geralt, Yen and Ciri as a messy but fiercely loving family unit who really do belong together. Committing to Yen and proving that the djinn never really controlled your destinies is the lore-appropriate storybook outcome… but if your Witcher canon begins and ends with the games, think about your past with Triss before you make the call. Other outcomes:Yen confesses her love, but Geralt tells her the \"magic's gone,\" ending the possibility of future romance. Objectively correct choice:\"Put the baby in the oven.\" What makes it agonizing?I mean, you're throwing a baby in an oven. Udalryk bursts into the room and demands you *not* throw his baby into a blistering hot oven The Witcher 3 doesn't often force you to make truly snap decisions, and this is one of the hardest—or at least most momentarily panic-inducing—in the game. In the quest Possession, Geralt is trying to break a curse by tricking a specter called a Hym. Cerys, the fierce daughter of the Craite clan, hands you the kidnapped baby of Skellige jarl Udalryk, who's under the curse, just before the jarl bursts into the room and demands younotthrow his baby into a blistering hot oven. This whole quest hinges on whether you trust Cerys. She wouldn'treallyhave you roast a baby to a crisp, right? Turns out, no—the trick being played is on Geralt, and his fresh guilt attracts the Hym to latch onto the witcher instead of Udalryk. When Cerys reveals the baby's all fine thanks to a bit of sleight of hand, the curse is broken and no babies were burned. Other outcomes:Though you don't know it in the moment, this quest will have a happy ending either way. You can choose to fight the Hym instead, but you'll disappoint Cerys and receive a fist to the face from Udalryk for your caution. The Witcher 4: What we know about Ciri's storyWitcher 3 mods: Good huntingThe Witcher books: Where to startWitcher 3 console commands: Cheat deathThe Witcher season 4: Hemsworth's debut Objectively correct choice:Killing the spirit in the Whispering Hillock What makes it agonizing?There's no happy outcome for the Bloody Baron's family, just sad and sadder. The best questline in The Witcher 3, and one of the finest in RPGs, period, is thebleak story of the Bloody Baron, who seems like a one-note bastard of a side character until you discover the tragic family story lurking behind his anger. The Baron's quests, Family Matters and Return to Crookback Bog, embody The Witcher 3's approach to hard decisions, making it clear that sometimes trying to do the right thing can still lead to the wrong outcome, and sometimes there's no right choice at all. The \"best\" case scenario leaves the Baron's wife Anna alive but out of her mind. To arrive at that result, you'll have had to convince the Baron to bury their miscarried child, a botchling, and completed the Whispering Hillock sidequest, killing the spirit trapped there. As a result you're dooming several orphans the spirit offers to save from the bog Crones, with their deaths driving Anna mad. You'll last see the Baron and Anna setting off to visit a healer, with the Baron holding onto a faint chance of restoring her to her former self. Other outcomes:Anna can be cursed by the Crones and turned into a hag. Even if you break the curse and cure her, she'll die as a result, leading the Baron to hang himself. Objectively correct choice:Kill 'em all. What makes it agonizing?Several minutes of Triss screaming as they rip her fingernails out. The quest to track down Dandelion and Ciri includes a detour to find Dijkstra's stolen treasure, culminating in a showdown with some very nasty witch hunters. Triss offers to help: You'll pretend to turn her over as a prisoner to sneak into the heavily guarded base. If you do, though, the scumbags are so eager to torture Triss that they'll get right to it while you're trying to play it cool and get some info out of their leader Caleb Menge. Even though it was Triss's idea, it just ain't right letting her get tortured by dudes who so thoroughly deserve killing. As soon as they try to throw Triss in a cell, drop the act. Other outcomes:If you stick out all the dialogue with Menge, Triss will kill him herself.It's pretty badass, but you should rightly feel bad that things got that far. Objectively correct choice:Sorry lady, gimme that rose. What makes it agonizing:What happens to us after we die? By what right do you take the last thing this woman can call her own? You're tasked with acquiring the violet rose Olgeird left her with, but taking it will consign her to a true, final death If you've ever said something you'd later regret to a loved one, the Scenes From a Marriage quest inHearts of Stonewill smack you in the chest like a sack of bricks. Dashing Olgeird's demon-summoning and faustian bargains were definitely his main issue, but the quiet, little ways he hurt his wife before the shit really hit the fan are what sticks with me. Put your damn book down and listen to her, man! Iris von Everec now lives in a haunted purgatory, reliving the dissolution of her marriage in a bizarro version of their family home, with the titular scenes from the marriage showing all the ways Olgeird hurt her. You're tasked with acquiring the violet rose Olgeird left her with, but taking it will consign her to a true, final death. Taking one more thing from a woman who's had everything ripped away from her feels utterly vile, but the alternative is leaving her in this pocket dimension to stew on all the ways she was wronged, with no hope for closure or resolution. Pull off the bandaid and take the flower, I say.— Ted Litchfield Other outcomes:Iris paints a picture of herself holding the rose that Olgeird accepts instead of the real thing. Iris is trapped in a hell dimension of her own memories for, presumably, eternity. Objectively correct choice:Daddy Geralt, of course. What makes it agonizing:Change is scary! Finally we arrive at the ultimate crisis point in The Witcher 3: a choice that will send ripples throughout the entire Northern Kingdoms. When you visit a barber in The Witcher 3, you're given the choice between a range of hairstyles and beard options, including taking Geralt back to his clean shaven Witcher 1 and 2 days. If you played hundreds of hours of those RPGs before The Witcher 3, seeing Geralt with a beard may be jarring. He looks older. Don't you long for the clean shaven Geralt? Isn't that what heshouldlook like? I understand that instinct, but it'swrong. Wrong wrong wrong. The Witcher 3 is the end of Geralt's journey; it's about him embracing fatherhood and putting Ciri's needs above his own. And it's also about him looking so 10 out of 10 handsome with that beard that even Santa Claus and Hayao Miyazaki would be jealous. There's only one proper outcome: letting go of the past and embracing the dad beard. Other outcomes:You can give Geralt a ponytail, shaved temples and \"friendly mutton chops\" if you're an absolute freak with no respect for the dignity of our favorite monster hunter.

    "article_text": "Lyall says that they are appealing the decision that saw the patches go up in smoke. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Last week, users onRedditandResetEranoticed that the GitHub library of DIY developer Lyall had been completely erased, with all linksresulting in a 404 error. Lyall's work included ultra widescreen patches for major games like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33,Assassin's Creed Shadows, and more. I have reached out to Lyall and GitHub for comment and will update this story if I hear back. Lyall has posted amessage on Patreonapologizing for the takedown, saying they aren't sure what caused it, and noting that they have appealed the ban through GitHub support. \"Having the rug pulled out from under me has been quite the stressful experience and it's exposed the fact that all my eggs are in one basket when it comes to hosting the fixes that I write,\" Lyall said on Patreon. \"Going forward I plan on looking into alternatives for hosting the source code and releases for my work. I'll likely continue using GitHub if I can alongside mirroring my repositories and releases elsewhere. \"Hopefully this situation will be resolved soon but until then I have quite a lot to think about. As soon as I have an update on the suspension, I will let you all know.\" In the meantime, and if GitHub does not reinstate Lyall's account, they have begunuploading their projects to NexusModsas a backup. The big question posed by all this is why such huge games are reliant on an external developer's unofficial patches for fixing (or even providing in the first place) their ultrawide support. My only answers are unsatisfactory supposition: Time, money, and the utter tyranny of the standard, 16:9 aspect ratio. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. A rising tide lifts all boats, and I've actually benefitted from ultrawide patches as aCRT sicko⁠—once arbitrary aspect ratios are in play, it's just as easy to squash things to 4:3 as it is to stretch them to 21:9. Ditto for the Steam Deck's slightly funky 16:10 screen. This whole situation goes to show how fragile and ephemeral the ecosystem of user patches and mods that make many games playable can really be. Thankfully, Lyall is in a position to reupload their work, and they may even make it back on GitHub, pending appeal, but there are no easy answers to the wider issue of fan patch/mod preservation as we stare down an increasingly balkanized, enshittified internet. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Ted has been thinking about PC games and bothering anyone who would listen with his thoughts on them ever since he booted up his sister's copy of Neverwinter Nights on the family computer.

    "article_text": "It's time to dig one of the best RPGs out of the backlog. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Most modern RPGs still can't match whatThe Witcher 3did 10 years ago. It's a huge game with almost no filler, cool monsters to fight, and sidequests that don't feel like sidequests. It's a tremendous achievement that a lot of us at PC Gamer remember fondly and will be reminiscing about this week forits anniversary. But if you've never touched it,Steam has it available for 90% offduring this week'sCD Projekt Red Sale. And that's just the base game. The excellent expansion packs,Blood and WineandHearts of Stone, are also on sale for under $6. At prices as low as these, you'd be a fool to not just pick up the complete set for $10. That's enough Witcher to keep you satiated until CDPR starts telling us more about theCiri-led sequel. It's not just the Witcher 3 that's on sale, however. Steam has the entire series at a discount right now, which means you can go back to where it all started with the first Witcher game. I can't say I'd recommend that though: The OG is, well, a little rough compared to the leaps in polish CDPR made with the Witcher 2. I'd skip it and wait forthe remakethat's on its way. There's Witcher DNA in Cyberpunk 2077 despite how dramatically different it is as a game and a world, if you're in the mood for some sci-fi. After the big2.0 update in 2023, it's a much more flexible and fun RPG than it was before. It's almost50% offfor the Steam sale and includes Phantom Liberty, the expansionTed saidis \"a tense spy thriller with some of the most grueling choices I've ever seen in an RPG.\" But you really can't go wrong with The Witcher 3. Much like the moment Dark Souls clicked for me and ruined every other action game I've tried since, playing the Witcher 3 for the first time will give you a taste of what truly expansive and story-rich RPGs can be. This is the cheapest it's been on Steam and I can promise you you won't regret it. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "SAG-AFTRA members have been striking over AI in videogames since July 2024. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Last week, Epic was forced to deploy a hotfix to prevent Fortnite players from tricking its newly-addedAI-powered Darth Vaderfrom swearing and saying slurs with James Earl Jones's voice. Today, AI Vader is the source of yet another controversy: SAG-AFTRA has filed unfair labor practice charges against Epic Games, alleging that the Fortnite publisher's use of AI-generated voice constituted \"unilateral changes\" to terms and conditions of employment covered by union bargaining. \"We celebrate the right of our members and their estates to control the use of their digital replicas and welcome the use of new technologies to allow new generations to share in the enjoyment of those legacies and renowned roles,\" SAG-AFTRA said in apress release. \"However, we must protect our right to bargain terms and conditions around uses of voice that replace the work of our members, including those who previously did the work of matching Darth Vader's iconic rhythm and tone in video games.\" Video game performers represented by SAG-AFTRA, which organizes collective workplace bargaining for more than 150,000 actors, journalists, singers, and other entertainment and media professionals, have beenon strike since July 2024, when ongoing contract negotiations with videogame publishers and developers collapsed over AI protections. Epic's implementation of Fortnite's AI-powered Vader arrived just days after it, alongside the other videogame companies involved in ongoing strike negotiations,issued a new contract offer to the union. The latest tentative contract removed a so-called \"unlimited digital replica buyout\"; essentially, under the new offer's terms, employers would agree to pay performers similar rates for any AI-generated replicas of their performance at similar rates to in-person work. In itsunfair labor practice filing with the NLRB, SAG-AFTRA alleges that Epic's use of AI-generated voices in Fortnite allowed the publisher to circumvent union bargaining about the terms of protected work. By \"utilizing AI-generated voices to replace bargaining unit work on the Interactive Program Fortnite,\" Epic \"failed and refused to bargain in good faith with the union by making unilateral changes to terms and conditions of employment, without providing notice to the union or the opportunity to bargain,\" SAG-AFTRA said.

    "article_text": "Go get 'em boys. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Even though Diablo 4 ismuch harder this season, a clever player has proven that you can get surprisingly far without using a single attack. I wouldn't quite call it a pacifist run because it involves an entire army of wolves chewing through monsters, but it's as close as you can get to a build that doesn't technically register a single skill to clear one of the game's toughest dungeons. Diablo 4 playerGoblinSorixtook 20 of their pet wolves (and werewolves) on a walk through a tier 65 run of the Pit, a late-game dungeon most builds strive to complete. With zero skills to use, all they have to do is stand and watch their furry army chew through rooms full of demons. It's a lot slower than a sorceress frying everything to a crisp as they teleport from screen to screen, but there's a gleeful satisfaction in seeing the point of the game fully circumvented as GoblinSorix lets their pets do the work for them. \"Boring to watch, but fun to play, laughed a lot, and was on the edge of my seat,\" they wrote in apost on Reddit. As someone who has barely touched druids, it's a little hard for me to tell what exactly is going on with GoblinSorix's build. They show off their gear in aseparate videoand it looks like they've basically equipped anything in the game that makes your companions better. One piece of gear turns all their wolves into werewolves and another boosts their damage a bunch. Season 8's boss powers play a big role too, periodically sending a wave of acid that helps melt through tougher enemies. A few seasons ago, this wouldn't have been possible. Blizzard only recently made it so companions mirror your character's stats and trigger all the same bonuses as you. This massive change fully unlocked the possibility for builds like this, and even if they're not the meta-approved quickest way to solve problems, it's fun to see that it's possible. GoblinSorix says they have a lot more work to do on their gear too. It's actually pretty impressive they pulled this off without fully upgrading their items—something that could easily double their damage. Give them another week or two and I expect they'll be pushing Pit tier 70 without having to lift a finger while the rest of us frantically try to remember the correct order of skills to use for maximum efficiency. Maybe GoblinSorix is the only one us playing Diablo the right way. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Ten years! How many times in the last decade have we fetched that frying pan, whistled for Roach to give us a lift, sliced drowners in half, and used our Witcher senses to track a blood trail to a monster's lair, only to find a tragic story at the end of what seemed like a simple hunt? The Witcher 3was a shoo-in for the canon of all-time PC RPGs as soon as it released in May 2015. A decade flew by in an instant, and not just because the passage of time is a haunting reminder of mortality for those of us without witcher mutagens keeping us spry for centuries.

    "title": "Haunted looking art director livestreams apology for Marathon theft scandal, but chat is merciless: 'Would write an original comment, but I don't see any good ones to plagarize'",
    "article_text": "In other not-great signs, the game's tagline has also become a meme about art theft. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Last week Bungie was accused of using the designs of an independent artist, Antireal, without her knowledge or permission. It's a pretty cut-and-dry case: elements of Marathon's environment artunquestionably copy iconographyfrom posters designed byAntireal in 2017. It didn't help that several of the game's art team also follow her accounts on social media. Bungie issued a statement acknowledging the \"unauthorised use\" and blamed the situation on a former employee: \"We immediately investigated a concern regarding unauthorized use of artist decals in Marathon and confirmed that a former Bungie artist included these in a texture sheet that was ultimately used in-game. \"This issue was unknown by our existing art team, and we are still reviewing how this oversight occurred. We take matters like this very seriously. We have reached out to [Antireal] to discuss this issue and are committed to do right by the artist.\" That mea culpa was followed last Friday by a livestream in which game director Joe Ziegler and art director Joseph Cross directly addressed the controversy, beginning with another prepared apology from Cross before the pair fielded questions. I will say upfront that this is in places uncomfortable viewing: Cross is clearly exhausted and looks miserable throughout. Regardless of how this plagiarism accusation plays out, and how Antireal is compensated, it is obvious these events have taken a considerable personal toll on Bungie's staff. The chat is largely oblivious to this and some viewers go straight for the jugular. Marathon's tagline is \"ESCAPE WILL MAKE ME GOD\" which was co-opted during the stream and turned into the meme \"PLAGIARISM WILL MAKE ME GOD\", which was spammed on repeat throughout, with minor variants. Cross somehow manages to get through an hour of this, and gamely answers some of the most prominent audience questions. One of these is about how exactly Bungie will compensate Antireal and why it was scrubbing all the assets in question rather than employing the artist who made them. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"For what it's worth we're confident the majority of the assets in that capacity are original, created internally by our internal artists,\" says Cross. \"We would love to work with Antireal if that's an opportunity that presents itself: that's part of what we sort of reached out to communicate.\" This is one of the elements of the plagiarism scandal that has gotten out of hand. Bungie has definitely incorporated some of Antireal's iconography, and its feet should be held to the fire for that. But this has now ballooned into a baseless accusation from some that Marathon's entire art style is plagiarised from this artist. \"At this point it's a very small set of assets,\" says Cross. \"The decals themselves are the kind of details that are placed on the sides of buildings or crates or something like that so we absolutely do need to replace them and we would rule in any sort of way of doing that including contracting, collaborating or working with the artist for sure.\" \"Something slipped through our net,\" adds Ziegler. \"So we have to go back and look at everything just to make sure that nothing else slipped through our net if that makes sense. Because it caught us by surprise and we want to make sure that we're doing the right diligence to ensure it doesn't happen again: so either way we're going to scrub all the assets just because we want to make sure that we didn't miss something else.\" Whatever else can be said about Bungie, and how these assets found their way into Marathon, it is at the very least holding up its hands. But there's not much sympathy out there for the studio: probably because this is the fourth time this has happened in four years: last year fan art was usedwhile designing a Destiny 2 Nerf gun; in 2023, an in-game Destiny 2 cutscene featuredartwork copied from another artist; in 2021, Bungie admitted that fanart of Xivu Arath was \"accidentally used\" in a trailer for the Witch Queen. The YouTube comments under the livestream are unforgiving. \"You know, it's telling that you used Percy Shelley's Ozymandias in your cinematic, a poem that spoke of the fall of once great empires, lost to the sands of time,\" says SunCityRebel. Other examples include: \"I would write an original comment, but I don't see any good ones to plagarize\" and \"art extraction shooter genre.\" Inevitably, there's plenty more of that on the game's subreddit, but also a little more empathy for the situation: \"I think it’s a good apology,\"says Marikal. \"You guys make it seem like this guy is an evil mastermind stealing stuff on purpose. What happened was some contractor working under him stole stuff back in 2020 and it slipped past him. Yes it is his responsibility, and so he is trying to make it right and fix it, but it’s not like he wanted this.\" This incident has taken place at a time where it feels like, for whatever reason, community sentiment has soured badly around Marathon. Despite a fantastic launch trailer andbroadly positive responses from those who've played it, you don't have to go far to find folk talking about how \"cooked\" the game / studio is, confidently predicting it's going to fail, and making comparison to another Sony-published live service shooter:the catastrophe that was Concord. Bungie was up against it with Marathon anyway: a plagiarism scandal in the runup to release was the last thing it needed. A new report claims morale at the studio is in \"free fall.\" Senior individuals like Cross have to carry the can, and that's their job. But for the studio and the game's sake, this situation needs an amicable resolution and a line drawn under it yesterday. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Rich is a games journalist with 15 years' experience, beginning his career on Edge magazine before working for a wide range of outlets, including Ars Technica, Eurogamer, GamesRadar+, Gamespot, the Guardian, IGN, the New Statesman, Polygon, and Vice.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It was nary a week ago that I came to you with news that a modder named ColdTyrant had ginned up a system to keepOblivion Remastered's Dark Brotherhoodkeep going forever: bolting on a whole Hitman Freelancer-esque contracts mode with an accompanying gacha rewards system. It was cool as heck, and is now old news—ColdTyrant has returned withThieves Guild – Infinitum, which does the same thing for the Gray Fox's gang. Just like the DB quests, this is essentially a quest-generation system in the vein of the radiant missions you get in Skyrim. \"Take on Radiant Special Requests to steal specific items throughout Cyrodiil,\" says ColdTyrant, boasting of \"100 infinitely repeatable, randomly selected quests to obtain specific items for anonymous clients.\" It works, well, a lot like the Dark Brotherhood mod. You pick up envelopes with contracts on them from a new table in Dareloth's Garden and head off to filch whatever it is that needs filching. Once you've deposited your lucre in a drop box, you'll get a leveled gold reward (all the way up to level 30) plus some points of a new currency called Fox's Favor. Unlike the Brotherhood mod, which saw you spenditscurrency on its gacha scamp (yep), you can exchange Fox's Favor for Thieve's Guild services: wiping your bounty, your infamy, getting lockpicks, or getting special gear. I love the idea behind both of these mods. Replaying Oblivion, I think a big but under-discussed reason everyone remembers the Thieves' Guild and Dark Brotherhood so fondly is that so many of their quests take place in the game's bustling clockwork cities, where the legitimate guilds are constantly sending you out to caves and ruins that don't have anything in them but monsters. It's way more fun to sneak into a shop while the owner's asleep upstairs than it is to plumb the depths of yet another ruined fort, and mods like this let you do it forever. Still, if youdowant the legal guild quests to go on forever, ColdTyrant has you covered:Arena – InfinitumandFighter's Guild – Infinitumdo much the same thing for those two factions, letting you constantly do new quests instead of checking out once you become guildmaster.

This is an open-source standard, created by Anthropic—an AI business that's a mere four years old. The idea behind it is that it makes it much easier for AI systems to access and share for training purposes, and when it comes to the specific area of AI agents, it should help them perform far better at their tasks. Fundamentally, AI agents are a type of artificial intelligence system that just do one very specific task, such as searching through code for a certain bug and then fixing it. They run autonomously, analysing data and then make a decision based on rules set out during the AI's training. Agentic AI, to use the proper name for it all, has a wide range of potential applications, such as cybersecurity and customer support, but it's only as good as the data it has been trained on. Enter stage left, MCP, which essentially lets AI agents work hand-in-hand (or should that be tensor-in-tensor?) with other agents to improve the accuracy of their outputs. According to Reuters, Scott remarked that \"MCP has the potential to create an 'agentic web' similar to the way hypertext protocols helped spread the internet in the 1990s.\" It's not just about training data, though, as the accuracy of agentic AI depends heavily on something called reinforcement learning. Similar to how 'rewards' and 'punishments' affect the behaviour of animals, reinforcement learning helps AI agents focus on optimising their outputs based on achieving the biggest rewards. Having AI agents share what works and what doesn't would certainly be useful in reinforcement learning, but it doesn't raise the question as to what happens if agents are simply left to their own devices. Does one simply assume that the network of agents will never accidentally pick a negative strategy over a positive one? What mechanisms would need to be created to prevent an 'agentic web' from spirally into a negative feedback loop? Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Better brains than mine will surely have raised the same questions by now and, hopefully, developed systems to prevent all of this from happening. What is artificial general intelligence?:We dive into the lingo of AI and what the terms actually mean. In the same way that certain stocks and shares are automatically sold and bought by computers, with next to no human interaction at all, we could be nearing the point where many aspects of our lives are decided for us by an enormous network of interconnected AI agents. For example, customer support services for banks, emergency services, and other vital systems could well be entirely agentic AI within a decade or so. I'm not knowledgeable enough about AI to sensibly judge if this is a really good thing or a really bad one, but my gut feelings suggest that the reality of the situation will end up being somewhere between the two extremes. Let's just hope is much closer to the former than the latter, yes? Nick, gaming, and computers all first met in 1981, with the love affair starting on a Sinclair ZX81 in kit form and a book on ZX Basic. He ended up becoming a physics and IT teacher, but by the late 1990s decided it was time to cut his teeth writing for a long defunct UK tech site. He went on to do the same at Madonion, helping to write the help files for 3DMark and PCMark. After a short stint working at Beyond3D.com, Nick joined Futuremark (MadOnion rebranded) full-time, as editor-in-chief for its gaming and hardware section, YouGamers. After the site shutdown, he became an engineering and computing lecturer for many years, but missed the writing bug. Cue four years at TechSpot.com and over 100 long articles on anything and everything. He freely admits to being far too obsessed with GPUs and open world grindy RPGs, but who isn't these days?

    "title": "As the follow-up to one of the greatest city builders, Anno 117: Pax Romana has a big toga to fill, and I think it might deliver the goods",
    "article_text": "Rome wasn't built in a day, but at least you can construct a nice aqueduct in a few hours. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I do not typically recommend completely tanking a city's economy, potentially ruining the lives of all of its citizens and being heralded as a complete idiot, as a way to learn a valuable lesson. But this is exactly what happened to me in Anno 117: Pax Romana, and I came out the other side really vibing with the directionUbisoftis taking it in—using its predecessor as a starting point, before fiddling with the formula in interesting ways. The latest entry in the long-running city building series has been kicked back to the golden age of the Roman Empire, but as I began my first foray into colonising antiquity, it didn't feel a million miles away from my sojourn as a governor in Anno 1800. Everything from the moment-to-moment city-building to the broad structure of establishing a small, sustainable colony before setting off across the ocean to exploit more resources felt incredibly familiar, despite the gulf between the two eras. This familiarity did make the establishment of my first colony nice and straightforward, of course, as I followed the missions doled out by my mentor. I briskly constructed a slew of production chains across the island, feeding my citizens' desire for the basic necessities and expanding relentlessly. If you've played Anno 1800, you'll find getting started pretty effortless. The good news is that this sense of over-familiarity was short-lived. Anno 117 is not a table-flipping sequel full of endless experimentation, but from the four hours I spent playing it, it messes around with the setting in fun ways and shakes things up just enough that the Roman Empire feels like a new frontier. It all clicked when my economy collapsed. The early campaign missions are designed to get your first colony up and running and mostly self-sufficient, and being very aware that I had limited time, I was trying to smash through it, rapidly expanding without letting my economy stabilise. So I'd been running a deficit for a while. And then I just completely ran out of cash, prompting the game to question my suitability for the job. There was an obvious solution. My warehouses were bursting with goods I could put up for sale, allowing my rivals to gobble them up, netting me a chunk of cash. But I wanted to have a nice, stable colony that didn't need to rely solely on trade to survive. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. That's where Anno 117's building bonuses came into play. Ubisoft's really gone all in on adjacency bonuses this time, and they make city building feel even more tantalisingly puzzle-like. And thankfully buildings have a large sphere of influence, rather than only affecting the buildings right next to them. Rearranging my colony, then, proved to be the solution to my economic woes. This is where Anno 117's building bonuses came into play, which make city building feel even more tantalisingly puzzle-like. Simply placing a bakery within a dense residential area immediately increased the income generated by the entire area, though like a lot of buildings, it came with a trade-off: baking all that bread also increased the likelihood of a fire breaking out. A pig farm, meanwhile, reduces the happiness of the surrounding area, because while pigs are wonderful, nobody wants to live near these grunting poop generators. With all these different bonuses and negative effects, often you'll have to decide if happiness or profit are more important for you at that moment. If a civil revolt is looming, and you don't have the peacekeeping infrastructure to handle it, pissing people off isn't going to be the smart play. But if your coffers are dwindling, that quick cash injection is going to look pretty seductive. When you couple this with other location-based mechanics, like the limited range of storage buildings and the need for resource-generating buildings to be placed within specific areas, the layout of your city becomes a top priority—even more so than in 1800. Building bonuses are especially relevant to research. Some buildings generate knowledge from their sphere of influence, which can then be spent in a meaty research menu divided into economic, civil and military trees. Discoveries run the gamut from bonuses for specific buildings, to substantial upgrades, to enhanced ships. It's quite different from 1800's research mechanics, introduced in the Land of Lions DLC, and benefits from being wider-ranging and considerably less fiddly. Also significant is the addition of deities. If you are a city builder of a certain vintage, you may remember how gods played a big role in games like Pharaoh and, even more so, Zeus. Now, the gods of Anno 117 are not going to be showing up and flexing their muscles, but their impact is much greater. With the ocean playing such a big role in Anno 117, you might want to make Neptune your patron deity, as dedicating yourself to the big lad will, over time, earn you helpful bonuses, including increasing the swiftness of your naval vessels. There's an entire religious progression system built into the game, with the belief your colonies generate fuelling it. A religious building like a sanctuary, for instance, generates both happiness and belief within its area of effect, and it's through this resource that you can start accessing your chosen god's handy bonuses. You can also switch deities—and not just to Roman ones. The Romans were extremely pragmatic when it came to religion, and players are encouraged to carry on this tradition. Which conveniently brings us to a feature that's cropped up in a bunch of Anno games, but which has been given some ancient flavour here. While your first colonies will be in Anno's facsimile of the Mediterranean, you can also hop up north, where you can start colonising Celtic lands, splitting your attention and resources between two very distinct areas. And like Anno 1800, it sounds like more provinces will be appearing after launch. I wasn't able to mess with the Celts in my playthrough, but Ubisoft did tease what we'll be able to expect when we can eventually expand our reach to new lands. While you'll still be playing as a Roman governor, bringing with you Roman inventions, you'll still be able to let your Celtic citizens maintain their original identity rather than squashing their culture. Expanding north, then, means new flavour, new resources, new buildings—which will still be present even if you choose to focus on the Romanisation of your far-flung colonies. The choices you make about what culture to promote or what god to worship don't take place in a vacuum, either. Your citizens will have some thoughts about your plans, as will other characters, like your rival governors, or the Emperor himself. So this is going to affect your domestic stability as well as diplomacy. From time to time you'll also receive requests from other governors, or your citizens will need you to resolve a dispute, like some workers who are not particularly satisfied with their terrible boss. In that case, you might compensate them for ill-treatment and appoint a new overseer, which will cost you some cash but give you a timed bonus to happiness. Or you could just embrace a life of corruption and take a bribe from the boss to look the other way. After a few hours, my previous economic woes were a distant memory. Sure, sometimes I got into the red, but only briefly, the result of some big projects, and between trading and bonuses I always had a way out of any hole I'd dug myself into. I also had a bunch of different colonies, along with an internal trading network that shipped goods from my primary colony to my new ones. This meant I could quickly build them up, after which I could start shipping their unique resources back home, allowing me to feed the needs of my increasingly demanding and massive population. As I approached the end of my Roman holiday, I finally got to start my first massive engineering project: the aqueduct. These bring fresh water to your colonies from the mountains and can be used to help stop your settlements from turning into a pile of singed timber, improve your agricultural industry and will become necessary for certain public buildings. Constructing one is a big undertaking that requires a vast amount of resources, and to be honest I did find it a touch fiddly, especially when the aqueduct intersected with my roads. But it was also exciting to embark upon a meaty engineering challenge like this—like my colony was all grown up. And while I couldn't go any further, it hinted at a turning point—like embracing the Industrial Revolution in 1800—with a whole set of new challenges and objectives. There was one other major new feature that Ubisoft wasn't ready to show off: land battles. Wars are no longer exclusively conducted by navies, so there's this whole mini-RTS layer that exists inside this city builder. I'm yet to find a convincing reason for cramming military conflicts into a city builder, and while Anno 117 might change this, it's a relief to know that this is all optional. By tweaking the settings you can just focus on the city building, and even if you keep the default settings, your AI rivals are actually pretty friendly. Anno 117 won't be launching until the end of the year, but these first few hours have the polished gleam of a game that's already out. It's quite the looker, too, with city streets bursting with tiny details and lively energy. And it's already so easy to lose yourself in all these production chains, engineering projects and trade ventures. With Anno 1800 as its foundation, alongside all these tweaks, twists and dense Roman flavour, I've got high hopes. Fraser is the UK online editor and has actually met The Internet in person.

    "title": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says 'PC gaming is now 30 years old,' and I'm here to say 'um, actually'",
    "article_text": "Huang definitely doesn't need the history lesson—but here I am with one anyway. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. No one likes the 'um, actually' guy. Whatever momentary high an um-actually-arsehole gets from jumping on a technicality in an off-the-cuff remark is either completely drowned out, or worse, strengthened by the resulting collective groan. Unfortunately, today, I'm going to be the 'um, actually' guy. My target? Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang—this can only end well for me! DuringNvidia's live keynoteat Computex 2025, Huang reflected on the success of GeForce and its position within the business today. On stage, Huang said that though the company owes a lot of its success to GeForce specifically, \"our keynote is 90% not GeForce. But it's not because we don't love GeForce.\" He then added, \"GeForce RTX 50-series just had its most successful launch ever, the fastest launch in our history. And PC gaming is now 30 years old—so that tells you something about how incredible GeForce is.\" So, what's wrong with that? Well, setting aside the various issues thatleft much to be desired about the 50-series launch, it's the simple fact that PC gaming easily pre-dates Nvidia's GeForce product line. To begin at the beginning, the GeForce 256 debuted in October 1999 and is largely credited with introducing many PC gamers to the modern concept of a Graphics Processing Unit. Still, it's not really fair to imply we wouldn't have PC gaming without Nvidia; it's understandable why the CEO of Nvidia would conflate the history of GeForce and the company with that of the platform itself during such a high-profile keynote but, simply put, PC gaming existed long before Nvidia was but a glimmer in Jensen Huang's eye. You're probably already groaning, but allow me to explain a little more: I'm dating myself here, but you wanna know which massively influential game I share a birth year with? Doom. That's right, I'm as old as the first-person shooter genre as well asthis here fine publication—but PC gaming is even older than that. For a start, my American colleagues could probably wax lyrical about the Commodore 64 (to say nothing about this doughnut shop in Indiana that'sstill using one of the 42-year-old machinesas part of its register system). However, as a Brit, I'd be much more in my element talking about copying game code out of the back of a magazine for the ZX Spectrum from 1982. Conferring with my colleagues encouraged me to get even more into the weeds (should that be 'conifer-ring'?); the whole concept of a 'personal computer' pre-dates the aforementioned 8-bit systems, with the term originating with the release of the IBM PC in 1981—and you can bet your bottom dollar that people were trying to play games on that too. Basically, the concept of gaming on an upgradeable computer as opposed to a console is definitely older than a mere 30 years. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. There you go, that's the 'um, actually'—unless you'd like to hear the one about how PC gaming as we know it was technically born on an oscilloscope in the 50's. Point is, we have always been asking 'but can I play games on it?' To say PC gaming is only three decades old takes an extremely narrow view of the history (to say absolutely nothing about what we lose when we focus on a purely Anglophone perspective). Catch up withComputex 2025:We're on the ground at Taiwan's biggest tech show to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to show. But back to the here and now for Nvidia. The 'PC gaming is now 30 years old' comment was preceded by Huang saying, \"GeForce brought AI to the world, now AI came back, and revolutionised GeForce.\" Besides bold claims earlier this year that theNvidia RTX 5070released in February would offer 'RTX 4090 performance at $549' thanks toDLSS 4 with AI-powered Multi Frame Generation, the company isn't simply content to leverage AI neural rendering to enhance the performance of its graphics cards. To say Nvidia is all in on AI is perhaps akin to beating a dead horse. Recent Nvidia projects likeG-Assist AI overlayas well as the actually pretty neatSigns, an AI-led platform designed to teach American Sign Language for free, are small potatoes compared tothe $115.2 billion raked in by data centers alonethis fiscal year. Nvidia EVP and CFO Colette Kress attributed this to, \"Customers [...] racing to scale infrastructure to train the next generation of cutting edge models and unlock the next level of AI capabilities.\" These data centre earnings easily overshadow what is far from loose change made byNvidia's gaming division. Still, though PC gaming doesn't begin or end with Nvidia, the company obviously still has tremendous influence over the space. A case in point would be the company's stringent guidelines to the press covering the release of their latest graphics card, which you can read all about in Dave's liveNvidia RTX 5060 review.

    "title": "Kojima says his next espionage game will keep us waiting another '5 or 6 years', but then he might finally get around to directing a movie: 'I’m getting older, and I would prefer to do it while still young'",
    "article_text": "He might be 61, but Kojima still wants to be a director when he grows up. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There is, as ever, a lot going on in the world of Hideo Kojima. In an interview published in a recent issue of French film magazineLe Film Français, Kojima spoke about his ongoing projects (viaVGC): There's Death Stranding 2. There's theDeath Stranding film adaptationin production at A24. And of course, there'sPhysint, Kojima's upcoming return to the tactical espionage action that secured his global reputation. Unfortunately, Kojima told Le Film Français that it'll probably take the better part of a decade before we can play his Metal Gear successor. \"Besides Death Stranding 2, there is Physint in development,\" Kojima said. \"That will take me another five or six years.\" Once Physint is squared away, however, Kojima told Le Film Français that he might finally turn his attention to directing a movie of his own. \"Maybe after that, I could finally decide to tackle a film,\" Kojima said. During Physint's announcement at the January 2024 PlayStation State of Play, Kojima said Physint would be a \"next-generation action espionage game\" that is \"also a movie at the same time in terms of look, story, theme, cast, acting, fashion and sound.\" Action espionage? Basically a movie? Inevitably wild casting and fashion choices? That checks all the Metal Gear boxes. (They're cardboard boxes, presumably.) According to Kojima, we shouldn't be surprised to hear it, because he said in February 2024 chat that he's making Physint becausewe all kept demanding more Metal Gear. That's an interesting quote in retrospect now that we know Kojima Productions was already busyturning Death Stranding 2 into Metal Gearanyway, but I'm not complaining about a surplus of hypercompetent bandana-clad stealth goofballs. What's curious about Kojima's conversation with Le Film Français is that he didn't mention OD, the horror gameannounced in 2023as a collaboration between Kojima and Jordan Peele. Similar to Physint, Kojima described OD as a game that's \"at the same time a movie, but at the same time a new form of media.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. In January 2025, Kojima said that the productions of both OD and Physint had beensuspended in 2024because of the SAG-AFTRA strike. Kojima clearly seems willing to acknowledge Physint's ongoing development, but OD's current status is unclear. If he does make an eventual pivot to directing movies, Kojima said it'll be the culmination of a life-long fascination. \"I grew up with cinema. Directing would be a kind of homage to it,\" Kojima said. \"Besides, I’m getting older, and I would prefer to do it while still young.\" Kojima's currently a spry 61 years old, and he's spent those six youthful decades as an open and unabashed movie nerd. It's hard to miss: Most of his oeuvre is a pastiche of 90s techno-thrillers, and he's beencramming familiar actors and directors into his game castsever since his production budgets have supported it. My only concern about Kojima's directorial debut is what kind of runtimes he'll subject theater audiences to. If Death Stranding had aboutfour and half movies' worth of cutscenesin it, how long are his movies going to be if there isn't any pesky gameplay to get in the way?

    "article_text": "\"He has mowed down hordes of guards, killed all his enemies… and got away with it all?\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. One Oblivion Remastered player has gone to extreme lengths to keep one rather murderous NPC alive: and in the end managed to fix things so not only did Glarthir take care of all his tormentors, but massacred half the town's guards too, and got away with the entire thing. The NPC in question is a wood elf called Glarthir, who's found in Skingrad and asks the player for some help. Glarthir's questline is called \"Paranoia\" and revolves around his belief that there's a conspiracy against him: he asks that you help prove his neighbours are wrong 'uns by following three of them around. There are various ways this can go, but one option is to tell Glarthir that his suspicions are correct, after which he'll ask you to kill the NPCs in question. If you refuse to do this, Glarthir then takes matters into his own hands and sets off on a little rampage to take out the three NPCs he suspects. Only problem is that Glarthir is not all that in the combat department. Let the game play out as normal at this point and Glarthir will, usually, be dispatched by the first NPC he tries to kill (who'll be aided by the town guards). Not good enough for player Plane-Session-6624, who decided to devote themselves to keeping Glarthir alive (via GR+). Initially they tried the simple tactic of kitting Glarthir out with some sweet endgame gear, but... \"Told Glarthir everyone is spying on him,\"said Plane-Session. \"I even went and bought him a set of full mithril and an elven battleaxe to reverse pickpocket. Turns out I can't reverse pickpocket in Remastered it seems… oh well.\" The alternative plan was to buff Glarthir as much as possible. \"I also have a fortify 100 strength and 100 endurance spell for him, and a powerful heal, but he just doesn't seem to be doing nearly enough to hurt the guards and I just can't keep my magicka up long enough to heal him through it.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Fellow Oblivion players offered various suggestions for how to keep the psychotic wood elf alive long enough to take out his enemies (as well as the guards that inevitably get involved). In the end, buffing the character's shield and blunt damage was what did the trick, alongside a powerful healing spell. \"I have created super saiyan Glarthir,\"said Plane-Session in an update. \"He has mowed down hordes of guards, killed all his enemies… and got away with it all?\" Plane-Session buffed Glarthir with a \"shield 70% spell, a fortify 100 Blunt spell, a fortify Agility spell which helped a lot preventing staggers, and fortify 100 END, along with a master level heal target spell. I spent about 4k on sorcery potions so I could keep all of these buffs active and keep his health up.\" The first target is called Bernadette, and this terrifying new incarnation of Glarthir \"made easy work\" of it. But Plane-Session is also watching over him: \"I sort of stand in her way when she starts to run towards the door so he can kill her inside without guard intervention.\" Next comes the biggest fight, with Glarthir having to get through four guards before reaching his second target. Plane-Session intervenes by splitting up the guards into smaller fights, because buff Glarthir can handle a 1vs1, before they reach Toutius Sextius. \"Toutius is actually pretty tough, he runs to his bedroom door to leave, but I keep closing it on him,\" says Plane-Session. \"Nowhere to run, Toutius. He helplessly tries over and over to open the door and leave while 100 Blunt Glarthir whacks him with an iron battle axe.\" Last target: Davide Surilie. Glarthir makes his way to the house without incident, and another bout of door closing leaves Davide trapped in a room with a murderous wood elf and his buffed gear. Funnily enough this NPC has a brother, Gaston, who hears the commotion of his brother being killed and approaches the pair: \"However, he lets us leave without violence and seems more concerned with the trespassing than with his brother's murder.\" In a classic Oblivion moment, Glarthir then seems to kind of glitch out. He heads to Skingrad chapel and just hangs out, refusing to talk to Plane-Session. \"Really Glarthir? After everything I did for you?\" Plane-Session helps Glarthir kill a couple more rogue guards, then leaves town and waits for four days. On their return, Glarthir is \"safe and sound sleeping in his bed. Waiting further, he now doesn't seem to leave his house. So for now it appears he will live.\" It's fair to say that this is an outcome Bethesda didn't prepare for: a random NPC should not be able to brute-force their way through several town inhabitants and take out half of the guards. But that's the magic of… well, magic I suppose, as well as one player's slightly odd fascination with helping a half-mad wood elf take out his enemies. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Rich is a games journalist with 15 years' experience, beginning his career on Edge magazine before working for a wide range of outlets, including Ars Technica, Eurogamer, GamesRadar+, Gamespot, the Guardian, IGN, the New Statesman, Polygon, and Vice.

President Trump called April 2, 2025 'Liberation Day', due to the announcement of 'reciprocal' tariffs against other countries. Since then, there's been lots of uncertainty and back-and-forth over what's being tariffed and by how much. That's already had a knock-on effect on the PC gaming hardware industry, which relies heavily on global supply chains, from shifting manufacturing and supply chains to price hikes and paused shipments. I've been combing through all the recent tariff news to make heads and tails of some of the effects we've seen on the industry, all of which you can find below. It's clear that tariffs can have knock-on effects for consumer prices. AsBest Buy's CEO explained back in March: \"We expect our vendors across our entire assortment will pass along some level of tariff costs to retailers, making price increases for American consumers highly likely.\" We've alreadyseen reportsthat Nvidia GPU prices have been hiked for exactly this reason, with the buck being passed on to AIBs and retailers who are then forced to raise prices in turn. But none of these are concrete effects that we can point to, so let's have a look at some of those. Just bear in mind that the following are short-term effects, and over the long term, there might be pros that make these short-term negative effects worth it or cons that make these short-term positive effects not worth it. I'll leave that for the political and economic pundits to figure out. The following are some real-world effects of tariffs that we've seen on the PC gaming hardware industry so far: February 2025 April 2025 There have also been some positive effects that might at least in part be due to the tariffs—positive, that is, if you live in the US. Although we should bear in mind that it's hard to say exactly how much of an effect tariffs had on these investment decisions compared to other factors such as previous investments. March 2025 There have been others (SoftBank, Apple, and so on), but these two are the main ones that are relevant for the PC gaming hardware industry. It's important to note that any possible positive effects will probably take a long time to come into full force. The main benefits might be more manufacturing based in the US and supply chains diverted away from China in general, but manufacturing takes a long time to set up, and supply chains can take a long time to adjust. A tariff is a levy imposed on importing certain products from another country. People in the home country must pay an additional tax for these products if they are imported from a country the tariff applies to. This is supposed to encourage people at home to buy these products from their home country rather than importing from elsewhere, because tariffed imports become too expensive. US tariffs were in effect prior to the second Trump administration, but since the start of April 2025, the US President Donald Trump introduced extensive 'reciprocal' tariffs against various countries and industries. A few days later, Trump walked back the tariffs against most countries butjacked them up against China. China is the primary target of US tariffs in part due to an ongoing trade war and technological 'arms race'. Althoughsemiconductors and computer parts were initially exempted from big reciprocal tariffs(but not from base tariffs such as base 20% 'fentanyl' tariffs), before long the US started toprobe the effects on national securityof semiconductor and computing imports, seeming to set the stage for bigger upcoming tariffs on chips and \"derivative\" products. Whether these will, in fact, see bigger tariffs in the coming weeks and months is an open question. The US and China thenput a 90-day pauseon big reciprocal tariffs, dropping from 145% and 125% back down to 30% and 10%, respectively. There were already some duties in place in addition to these, though, which might mean tariffs are actually a little higher than these numbers overall. TheFinancial Times explains: \"The consultancy Capital Economics calculated that, because of duties that predated Trump’s return to power this year, total US tariffs on China will now come down to about 40 per cent, while Chinese tariffs on the US would be about 25 per cent.\" Furthermore, these tariffs are only dropped against certain goods, and what will happen with semiconductors is still unknown. The pause doesn't apply to semiconductors, and the US is still deciding what to do about chips and computers. Despite lowering reciprocal tariffs, widespread tariffs are still in place, and there's a lot of uncertainty around the fate of semiconductor and derivative imports as well as related computing products. It seems like the US is still figuring out what to do with those. Such uncertainty might be part of the plan: The US can keep tariffs lower than was initially threatened, but if the threat still looms, companies may still move manufacturing away from China and towards the US regardless. Many PC hardware companies have manufacturing based, at least in part, in China. This is true even for many companies that we might not initially expect. For instance, some PSUs from American company Corsair are made by Seasonic, and Seasonic's factories arelocated in China. If companies keep manufacturing in China and other highly tariffed countries, American customers will have to pay a big tax on these products, and might stop buying them. Given the US is theworld's biggest consumer market, many companies will want to keep the country's companies and people as their customers. We can therefore expect at least some companies to do what they can to move manufacturing elsewhere, possibly even to the US. But such changes can take time, and in the meantime, we can expect prices on some PC gaming tech to take a hit, unless manufacturing companies lower prices to account for the new tariffs. In slim-margin industries, however, companies won't be able to do that too often or for too long. Jacob got his hands on a gaming PC for the first time when he was about 12 years old.

And yet despite our platform of choice's long and glorious reign, people still look at you funny when you tell them you built your own PC. 'Are you a warlock?' they ask, 'some kind of messenger from a realm beyond our own?' Yes, but that's besides the point. Building a PC is a cinch these days, which is why we're making it a lynchpin of the upcoming and glorious return of The PC Gaming Show thisJune 8. We'll be covering ourselves in thermal paste and reseating more RAM than you can shake a stick (of RAM) at in an event that will also feature over 70 games from studios likeUbisoft, 11 Bit, CCP Games, Failbetter, Krafton, and plenty more besides. The festivities will be presented by PCGS veterans Sean \"Day[9]\" Plott, Mica Burton, and Frankie Ward, who'll be peeking through their fingers as Verified PC Gaming Experts assemble a beast of a machine we're calling 'The Rig.' Even better, once we've made sure the monster gets past the BIOS screen we'll be shipping it to one lucky winner watching the show. If you love viewing and/or possessing absurdly powerful PC hardware, you can't afford not to tune in. The whole shebang kicks off at 12 noon PDT, 3 pm EDT, 8 pm BST, 9 pm CEST and 3 am (on Monday, June 9) China Standard Time, and it'll be viewable on pretty much any service that can hold a livestream. That means you'll be able to find it onTwitch,YouTube,X,Facebook,PC Gamer,GamesRadar+,GOG.com,SteamandBilibilias part ofSummer Game Fest.

    "article_text": "Explore the Cosmic Realm in search of collectibles…and Thira, of course. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Chapter 15's Cosmic Realm is a mind-bending location that sends you round in circles, which makes finding all of theCity of Ry'uul secretsa bit of a pain. Though far from the largest level inDoom: The Dark Ages, its several separate maps make it hard to figure out exactly when you're able to access secrets you can see just out of reach. Don't worry though, I've figured out the perfect route to collect all theDoom: The Dark Ages secretsin Chapter 15, City of Ry'uul, so you're not clueless in the Cosmic Realm. Below you'll find all the secrets and collectibles laid out in chronological order, so you can easily grab them as you go through the mission. There areten secrets and two collectiblesin Chapter 15. Sadly, these collectibles are just a codex and a toy, so no fancy new weapon skin up for grabs in the City of Ry'uul. There's also 182 gold, two rubies, a wraithstone, and two demonic essences, some of which you'll earn just by completing the objectives. The first secret comes almost immediately; before taking the green launch ring to leave the first floating island, drop off the ledge directly underneath the ring and break the branch barricade. This reveals a small area with the gold, but also a switch to open the gate back to the starting area, which is key for the next secret. Directly after the previous secret, use the switch to open the gate, and you'll see that a jump pad also activates opposite you on the other side of the area. Take the jump pad and you're launched up to the ruby statue. You'll no doubt notice another secret and jump pad on the other side of the area from up there, but you can't get that one until much later. Use the first green launch ring to access the next floating island, and continue until you reach the next ring. Turn left just before the ring to drop off a ledge into a tunnel filled with tentacles, where you'll find the life sigil. After using the cosmic eye and passing through the point of no return, continue to the next island and immediately turn around to shield jump up to the ledge with the chest. Directly after the previous secret, return to the main island and the ledge where you were before you shield jumped across the gap. From here, look to your right and drop down to a hidden area between a broken pillar and the wall, which leads to the codex. After picking up the Dreadmace, follow the objective into the next room and activate the lift, but drop into the water tunnel hidden beneath it instead. Dodge the blocks that try to crush you and swim up on the other end to enter the gated room with the ruby. Continue with the mission until you've earned the health demonic essence and completed the simple block puzzle to loop back to the room where you unlocked the Dreadmace. You'll now be able to take the water tunnel to the lift. Before activating the lift, walk past it and go up the path opposite you, leading to another water tunnel that takes you to the life sigil. Make sure you don't activate the lift first, as you'll block yourself from returning to the area, requiring you to reload a checkpoint or start the mission again. Following on from the previous secret, you'll be ambushed at the top of the lift. Before going through the door at the end of the hall, walk off the ledge to your right to grab this chest. Continue with the mission until you reappear on the first map. Jump across the islands, following the objective, until you climb to a platform where you’re supposed to go through a large door and continue to the starting area. Instead, drop off the edge to the right of the door, where you’ll find a hidden launch ring that will fling you to the gore nest island that you passed by earlier. Clear the nest and you'll earn an armour demonic essence. Just after heading through the large door to return to the first area near the end of the mission, look right and break the wooden barricade where you'll find the toy. There’s a wraithstone nearby as you head towards the objective as well.

    "article_text": "You can expect some crystals as compensation too. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The launch of Infinity Nikki's 1.5 update didn't exactly go as planned.Crashes and various technical issueshave seen the game branded with\"mostly negative\" reviewson Steam, with some saying that the entire ordeal had put them off playing. However, the devs of the beloved open world adventure game have finally released some updates on what to expect going forward. In anotice shared to the Infinity Nikki website, Infold says \"addressing these shortcomings remains a top priority for our team moving forward.\" A few details on the changes being made ahead of the next version release, alongside what you can expect as compensation were also shared. Most importantly, the new season of the game that was released alongside version 1.5, \"Bubble Season\" is being extended. So, now the season will run until June 12, which is when the new season will commence too. This also means that the limited-time items only available in the Starlit Shop during this season will also have their availability extended. Infold also shared that the new weekly tasks originally scheduled to release on May 20 will now debut in version 1.6 on June 12 to give the team time to \"refine task mechanics for a smoother experience.\" More details on these tasks will be announced closer to the release of the update. As compensation for the mishap of version 1.5, 360 Starlit Crystals are being sent out to all players. These can be redeemed in the Starlit Shop for various emotes, accessories, and outfit elements. Personally, I would've preferred 360 resonite crystals but I'm not going to complain. In addition, between June 5 to June 12, players will receive 120 Diamonds and 1 Energy crystal per day too, totalling 960 Diamonds and 8 Energy crystals before the release of the newest update. It might not be enough to redeem Infold and the rolling out of version 1.5, especially for those whose first experience with the game has been tainted. But it's certainly better than nothing.

    "title": "Thanks to the Computex, we now know that there's an RTX 5070-like GPU inside Nvidia's 'supercomputer at home' DGX Spark",
    "article_text": "Shame you won't be gaming with the little box because it'd make for one heck of a NUC. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. At its GTC event in March, Nvidia formally launched theDGX Spark, a mini-PC-sized desktop computer, created for AI enthusiasts and home developers. While Team Green offered a lot of information about the overall specifications, the full details of the GPU inside weren't disclosed. However, thanks to the annual design award scheme run by Computex, we now know that the supercomputer-at-home is essentially running anRTX 5070. This little detail was spotted byVideocardz, though you can see the information directly at theComputex site. Tucked away inside the GB10 chip are 6,144 CUDA cores—exactly the same number as sported by theGeForce RTX 5070graphics card (and, incidentally, theRTX 3070 Ti). Of course, despite both GPUs using Nvidia'sBlackwellarchitecture, the GB10 isn't a gaming processor. First of all, there's the dearth of memory bandwidth—just 273 GB/s to the RTX 5070's 672 GB/s. At least, you're getting a whole lot more RAM, as the DGX Spark sports 128 GB of LPDDR5x, which is unified and shared by the Grace CPU and Blackwell GPU. The RTX 5070 just has a measly 12 GB of GDDR7. Ignoring the huge amount of RAM for the moment, that bandwidth is more typical of what an iGPU in a really good handheld gaming PC or laptop might offer, so it doesn't mean youcouldn'tgame on the GB10. But given that the DGX Spark runs a custom Nvidia operating system, you're not going to be slapping your Steam library on it any time soon. One thing I did find interesting was a comment made byGolden Pig Upgrade Pack(now that's a name and a half!) on Weibo (via Videocardz), which spoke to MSI at Computex and discovered the little supercomputer uses up to 224 W of power. 'So what?', you may think. Well, the TGP of the RTX 5070 is 300 W, so the GB10's GPU must be clocked a lot lower, yes? Perhaps, but Nvidia says the GB10 has a peak tensor output of 1000 AI TOPS, whereas the RTX 5070 is 988. That means the Spark's GPU is either quite different from the GB205 in the 5070, or the AI throughput figures for both devices areverytheoretical ones. Either way, 224 W for something with a 20-core Arm CPU, an RTX 5070-like GPU, and 128 GB of RAM seems pretty darn good.

Catch up withComputex 2025:We're stalking the halls of Taiwan's biggest tech show once again to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to offer. We still have no idea exactly how much the DGX Spark will sell for, but it did have apre-order price tagof $4,000 bar a single buck. If I were an AI home enthusiast, I'd probably be very tempted—four thousand dollars might seem to be too expensive, but that 128 GB of unified RAM is perfect for AI training. You'd have to spend far more than that to build your own rig and fit it with enough workstation GPUs to match the same level of memory. I do wonder how long it will be before somebody turns a DGX Spark into a mini-sized gaming PC, though. Nvidia's DGX OS will probably be anything but easy to work with, in that respect, but if I've learned anything about the modding community, it's that the bigger the challenge, the more people will try to make it work.

    "article_text": "That's a lot of Hz. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. To most,TN panelsseem like a thing of days gone by. Trading ultimate speed and price for mediocre colour accuracy and poor viewing angles, it makes you ask, \"Do I really need that much speed?\" According toAsus, that answer is yes, as it has just unveiled a lightning-fast 610 Hz refresh rate monitor. In fairness, professional gamers will always take speed over pretty visuals any day, so they're likely to be pleased by what's in store for them. Shown off at the ground floor ofComputex 2025, in Taipei, Taiwan, Asus' new ROG Strix Ace XG248QSG is a 24.1-inch FHD monitor with that aforementioned 610 Hz refresh rate (while in OC mode) and a 0.1 ms response time. It also offers an input lag as low as 0.8 milliseconds. It does this all with what Asus calls a 'Super TN' panel—an evolution of TN technology. If you don't know what a TN or Twisted Nematic monitor is (I wouldn't blame you), it's a type of monitor now mostly used by professional gamers as they offer super-fast refresh rates and response times, and formerly just the preserve of rubbish budget monitors. The viewing angle of TN panels is usually worse than their competitors, and colour accuracy takes a hit too. Asus claims Super TN looks better than a traditional TN panel, bridging the gap between it, IPS, VA, and OLED. Our own Jacob, who is on the Computex show floor and saw the monitor in person, told me, \"The response seemed decent from the UFO test, but it had some obvious yellowing to the white colours as far as I could tell.\" It's worth noting that this is a short test, and he was only there for a few minutes, so it's not a definite judgment on the panel. He does, however, say that TN panels have come on quite a lot in recent times, and though there's a yellow tinge to it, Jacob does say the picture quality seems fine so far. Picture quality isn't why people buy TN monitors, though, and this one comes with ELMB2 (Extreme Low Motion Blur), which helps reduce motion blur for a much cleaner view, and the panel is reportedly much brighter than previous TN monitors. As well as all of this, it is enhanced with ROG's AI technology with AI visual boosts, alongside dynamic shadow enhancements, and dynamic crosshair boosts. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. This is all intended to make the monitor much easier to understand for professional-level gamers who need to make out and comprehend complex scenes in very short amounts of time. The difference between a particle effect or a grenade and a head popping out of cover can be the difference between a win and a loss. Catch up withComputex 2025:We're stalking the halls of Taiwan's biggest tech show once again to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to offer. To put my cards on the table, I am not, in fact, a professional gamer, so this panel will likely never quite see its potential runningThe Sims 4orElden Ringat an uncapped fps on my home rig. However, it certainly has some super impressive stats. To put it into context, MSI has just announced its ownOLED 500 Hz monitor, andSamsung has just done the same, though both will cost a pretty penny. Asus hasn't given a price that we can find as yet for its 610 Hz panel, but it's unlikely to be a budget option, either. We expect to see slowly increasing refresh rates across the board over the next few years, though getting above 500 Hz will still be a bit of a rarity, as will the graphics hardware capable of regularly doing so.

The news of Grand Theft Auto 6's delay was quickly followed by a chorus of reassuring words about howgreat it'll be when it finally releasesnext year, alongside a couple of solemn headpats for those of us who got our hopes up for a 2025 release, closely followed by asecond trailer. ButTake-Two InteractiveCEO Strauss Zelnick isn't done reassuring players that GTA 6 will be a hit. \"Rockstar Games is trying to create the best thing anyone's ever seen in entertainment, not just interactive entertainment, and that's a tall order,\" Zelnick says in an interview withCNBC. \"I think consumers have huge hopes for the title.

But all of this excitement probably puts even more pressure on the devs to make something that lives up to all the expectations, which is why a short delay is probably for the best. \"The delay itself is really a reflection of the desire to polish and create the best possible experience for consumers,\" Zelnick says. \"We as a company have been known not to have slavish devotion to release dates, but rather to seek the highest quality entertainment, and that's really supported our success over many years.\" While it's reassuring to hear just how well development is going for GTA 6, if I had a nickel for every time Zelnick said that GTA 6 is striving for perfection, I'd be four nickels closer to actually being able to afford it on release: Zelnick certainly seems convinced that Rockstar has perfection within its grasp when it comes to GTA 6, but that theory probably hasn't been tested by Zelnick, as he's adamant he doesn't play videogames. \"I'm not a gamer,\" Zelnick continues. \"I don't play videogames at all, I'm not the Consumer-in-Chief. I share my opinions pretty openly, but I think being the Consumer-in-Chief in the entertainment business as a CEO is probably a mistake.

Take-Two's stock is up 6% year on year, despite the GTA 6 delay, as is referenced in the CNBC interview, and Rockstar keeps on raking in the cash from Red Dead Redemption and GTA Online.

    "article_text": "House, hearth, and home. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. World of Warcraft's latest patch didn't land great—I've not had a chance to check it out myself, but to hear our contributor and WoW expert Heather Newman explain it, it seems as though it'sriddled with bugsand suffering from time-gated content and aweird release schedule. I suppose it was only a matter of time before Blizzard swung and completely missed. However, I am beyond excited about its player housing feature, which is slated to come sometime before the next expansion, Midnight. Reports from prominent YouTubers such asPreach GamingandTaliesin & Evitel, as well as an interview fromBreakflip(translated here viaWoWHead), seems to have everything pointed in the right direction. I'm just going to share a recollection from Taliesin, here, that already has me sold on the entire concept: \"Jay was showing us—he did like a live room build … he made a whole oven, and what he did was he used [a] kitchen cabinet sort of thing. And then he got a crate with an iron top on it, and he clipped that through the table so only the top of the crate was showing in the table, which made the stovetop. And then he took a bunch of barrels that had round tops, shrunk them down, and clipped them through the top of the stove top like hobs.\" My inner MMO sicko is bellowing 'yes!' I rarely get into housing, but I have put together bases in City of Heroes: Homecoming, a game which has had its base-building systems jailbroken and improved by a bunch of volunteer devs. What Taliesin describes here is something I have literally done myself in that game, except with wastebins and kitchen cabinets—and that was without the power of scaling. This kind of player housing is exactly what creates bustling, avid communities in MMOs likeThe Elder Scrolls Online, and Blizzard has landed on exactly the right stance by letting players scale, rotate, and clip objects into each other in a way that's supremely freeform. There are, of course, other elements outside the basic control scheme that are important to nail, and so far, Blizzard is saying all the right words. While Blizzard'salready braggedabout a lack of rental fees, auto-demolishments, or housing lotteries before, some other elements from the Breakflip interview seem very promising. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. First up, Blizzard's learned from Garrisons, and won't be tying Player Housing into direct power boosts in any way—it's a purely cosmetic system that'll let you make jumping puzzles, guild bases, taverns, whatever you want. No pay-to-win or power scaling benefits like in-housing Auction Houses—only anvils for professions and the like without any direct boosts. Moreover, while there'll be special furnishings you can get through achievements, they'll be rare—and Breakflip reports that anything that goes on the store will have a free equivalent available in-game. Neighbourhoods will be a thing, and \"are being designed as real living spaces, complete with Azeroth NPCs, seasonal events, dynamic interactions, etc\". All in all, glowing words from anyone who's taken it for a spin. There might be bugs or glitches or problems down the line, but Blizzard has enjoyed the benefit of years of hindsight from other games and put those lessons to use. And having seen just a glimpse of the broader MMO player housing community's creativity, I cannot wait to see what WoW's players cook.

    "article_text": "Turns out, BTF cards won't work on non-BTF motherboards, but the newer versions will. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. BTF, or Back-To-the-Future, graphics cards are special in that they contain an additional connector to the side of the PCIe slot, through which the graphics card is powered. Thus removing the need for any pesky cables. It's a neat solution for clean-cut PC builds, though as I haven't yet built with it, I hadn't realised it also had a problem with compatibility untilAsustold me all about it, and the incoming fix. You seeBTF graphics cardsrequire BTF motherboards to run without cables. That checks out, as both graphics card and motherboard need to support a special connection, called GC-HPWR, to power the card. However, what I hadn't thought about was that these graphics cards are not compatible with non-BTF motherboards since the GC-HPWR has, so far, been a non-removeable connection. That's set to change with the recently updated BTF 2.5 standard, which swaps to a removable GC-HPWR adapter. This can added or removed at will for support on BTF and non-BTF motherboards, making the whole compatibility issue a bit of a moot point. \"We figured out a smart way to solve this.,\" says Sharon Chang at Asus HQ, \"we added an additional detachable adapter to our BTF graphics cards. \"We call it graphics card high power adapter because it can withstand up to 1000 watts in spec for safe, reliable power delivery. If you don't have a BTF motherboard yet, you can remove the graphics card high power adapter and use the original 12-pin cable.\" What's more, Asus said during its Computex event that since its new BTF cards technically havetwoways of being powered up, there might be more that can be done using both at the same time. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"Some of you smart people might be asking, 'what happens if we plug both in at the same time?' For now, it will do nothing. The current mechanic only allows one way for power delivery. However, this does have some potential. \"Theoretically, a future BIOS update could support dual product delivery, allowing for even more overclocking headroom. So stay tuned as the BDF ecosystem grows.\" Catch up withComputex 2025:We're stalking the halls of Taiwan's biggest tech show once again to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to offer. You hear that? AnRTX 5090could be gobbling up to 1000 watts of power in a matter of time. Now that's a thought… a slightly scary one at that. Perhaps not quite 1000 watts, then. Either way, we're going to need pretty huge power supplies for this eventuality, not to mention at a certain point we'll hit the limit for what the average household power outlet can deliver. Though there is some interest in seeing how far an RTX 5090 could go with even more power coursing through its silicon. So long as it's not an RTX 5090 I've paid for myself—that sounds like a good way to kill a graphics card in a picosecond. If you've been holding out on a BTF build for this one compatibility reason, you can now find product pages for new BTF 2.5 cards, such as thisROG Astral RTX 5090 BTF Edition. Also it appears Asus is keen to get even more manufacturers into the mix with BTF: \"we are welcoming more partners to join this BTF ecosystem to grow it as a new industry standard,\" says Chang.

    "article_text": "The Van der Linde gang might be getting a facelift. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Red Dead Redemption 2 could be coming to Nintendo Switch 2, asreported by Gamereactor. According to \"sources close to Rockstar\" the open-world wild west adventure could come to the new console as early as this year too, adding to the selection of third-party games already announced at the initial Switch 2 direct likeElden Ring, and Cyberpunk 2077. Although the launch hasn't been confirmed officially by Nintendo or Rockstar, it doesn't seem entirely unrealistic. Especially after the launch of Red Dead Redemption on Nintendo Switch in 2023. Of course, concerns about whether or not the new hardware will be able to support the game are bound to crop up. The Nintendo Switch wasn't exactly praised for its performance. But I'm keen to see how the game holds up should the rumours be true. But Kara, I hear you ask, what does that have to do with PC Gamer? Well, I'm glad you asked. Aside from the potential Switch 2 release, Red Dead Redemption 2 is also supposedly going to receive a \"current-gen\" update on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S either alongside the Switch launch or either side of it. The details of what exactly this update could entail weren't shared, but that might mean a facelift for the PC version as well. I do imagine this update will involve a visual upgrade, given it's been stuck on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions since launch—and if Rockstar's already done the work, then hey, why not give us some shinier textures? As long as I can still ride a horse around Valentine, I'm happy. Unless Rockstar decides you have to pay for the upgrade. But I feel like that's a stretch. No update or any rumours regarding the PC release were shared, but with the game only making its way to PC in 2019, I'd have to wonder if it's early enough for any visual bumps on desktop. This could change should the release on Switch 2 and the current-gen update be officially revealed, but I won't get the cowboy blues if it doesn't happen. After all, if it ain't broke, don't fix it, and Red Dead Redemption 2 doesn't need any sort of fixing in my eyes.

    "title": "Nvidia's Jen-Hsun Huang boasts that one spine of its new NVLink Fusion tech can 'move more traffic than the entire Internet'",
    "article_text": "And unusually for Nvidia tech, it'll work with other vendors' CPUs, too. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Tech CEOs proclaiming unfeasibly large numbers at the launch of a new product is par for the course in the industry, and it's common practice to take them with a pinch of salt until someone's tested them. Even so, Nvidia's Jen-Hsun Huang was perhaps hoping for a bigger reaction at Computex when he claimed that one spine of its new NVLink Fusion system \"moves more traffic than the entire Internet.\" NVLink is Nvidia's processor interconnect technology, mostly used in big data centers, packed full of CPUs and GPUs. Its latest version,NVLink Fusion, was announced at this year's Computex event and during the presentation,Huang hauled an NVLink spine onto the table. Think of this as a tower of cables and controllers that allows 72 massive GPUs to communicate and share data. That single spine apparently can transfer data at a rate of up to 130 TB/s, which, according to Huang, is more data per second than the entire Internet shifts about. That particular figure, he says, is 900 Tb/s (note: small b = bits, large B = bytes), so the spine is transferring about 16% more data. That does sound like a ridiculously impressive figure, but it's somewhat meaningless. Not least being that other sources claim thepeak Internet data transfer rateis over 1,200 Tb/s. Then you have things like Nvidia'sRTX 5090, which has a peak L1 cache transfer rate of 50 TB/s—sure, that's way less than an NVLink spine, but it's also justoneGPU. Multiply it by 72, the number of GPUs the spine serves, and you have an absurd total transfer rate of 3,600 TB/s. What I'm getting at is that if one searches around enough, it's easy to find examples of equally bonkers data transfer rates. I'm not dismissing what NVLink can do—it's clearly impressive stuff—but the muted reception to Huang's \"moves more traffic than the entire Internet\" is somewhat indicative of how much people are used to hearing tech CEO's say such things. Catch up withComputex 2025:We're stalking the halls of Taiwan's biggest tech show once again to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to offer. Whatisimpressive, though, is the fact that NVLink Fusion isn't just for Nvidia CPUs and GPUs. Other 'semi-custom' processors from vendors such as Qualcomm, Fujitsu, and perhaps even AMD and Intel, will be able to utilise NVLink to hook up their CPUs to a mountain of Nvidia GPUs. Not that any of this technology will see the light of day in a gaming PC, of course. The humble PCIe interface still rules the roost when it comes to CPU-to-GPU communications and isn't going to be replaced anytime soon, and the days ofdual-GPU gaming rigsare now long gone. Shame really. It'd make for some awesome bragging rights if you wave your rig aloft and proclaim that its CPU can transfer 1.6% of the entire internet to the GPU in one go. That's way better than the paltry 0.11% mine can do. Nick, gaming, and computers all first met in 1981, with the love affair starting on a Sinclair ZX81 in kit form and a book on ZX Basic. He ended up becoming a physics and IT teacher, but by the late 1990s decided it was time to cut his teeth writing for a long defunct UK tech site. He went on to do the same at Madonion, helping to write the help files for 3DMark and PCMark. After a short stint working at Beyond3D.com, Nick joined Futuremark (MadOnion rebranded) full-time, as editor-in-chief for its gaming and hardware section, YouGamers. After the site shutdown, he became an engineering and computing lecturer for many years, but missed the writing bug. Cue four years at TechSpot.com and over 100 long articles on anything and everything. He freely admits to being far too obsessed with GPUs and open world grindy RPGs, but who isn't these days?

    "title": "Nvidia RTX 5060 review live: we've been black-listed for this review, but I'm a professional so we're doing this live!",
    "article_text": "Something a little screwy has been going on with the new Nvidia RTX 5060 graphics card launch. It was revealed a few weeks ago that Nvidia wasn't going to be helping sample cards for review testing of its budget-oriented RTXBlackwellGPU. Now, that's not completely unprecedented for a card low down the stack which doesn't have a Founder Edition to call its own. What is unprecedented, at least in my long experience, is the company refusing to allow review access to pre-release drivers to specifically block some media from having day one critiques of the hardware live at the time the cards go on sale. I've had an RTX 5060 sat on my desk for the past few weeks, as MSI has been happy to oblige us with the hardware, however, no vendor has been allowed to give us access to drivers in order for those pre-release cards to actually function as intended. I mean, I've just been using mine as a paperweight. But not all media has been blocked. Over the weekend, multiple sites had strictly controlled previews go live for the new RTX 5060 GPU, and those sites have had drivers ahead of time, and will have reviews going live for the embargo of 2pm today. Some of those sites are from the Future family of which we are part, yet it seems PC Gamer, and potentially Tom's Hardware, have been singled out as publicatio non grata for this launch. Now, it has to be said that Nvidia owes us nothing and has zero obligation to support PC Gamer around new graphics card launches. We're talking about a massive, multi-trillion dollar company now, and a GPU which will likely rise to the top of the Steam Hardware Survey in a handful of months no matter what we say; Nvidia doesn't need us. And yet, in all my time as a PC hardware journalist, at many different sites and publications, Nvidia always has supported pre-release reviews. And it has also consistently been a good sport about both favourable and unfavourable reviews, so long as they were fair, and honestly demonstrated why any conclusions had been drawn. I feel that's how we've been all along with with the RTX 50-series reviews and yet we find ourselves black-listed by the company for this one. Still, I'm a professional, I believe in giving our honest, independent opinions on PC gaming hardware and so, I'm going to be testing this card out live. Follow along with thelive updatesbelow as I go through benchmarking the card once public drivers are finally released. Because we've not been allowed access to review drivers we also don't have access to any reviewer's guide material which would confirm the specifications of the GPU at the heart of the RTX 5060. But enough has been published and leaked so far that we can be pretty confident that we're looking at another spin of the GB206 GPU used inside theRTX 5060 Ti. This time around there are six fewer streaming multiprocessors making up the RTX Blackwell chip, so just 3,840 CUDA cores and the requisite number of RT Cores and Tensor Cores coming out of those 30 SMs. That's a 25% increase in core count, and Nvidia has claimed a corresponding 25% increase in gen-on-gen raster performance, too. Alongside that is the much maligned 8 GB of GDDR7 VRAM, which ought to have the same level of memory bandwidth as the RTX 5060 Ti's 8 GB version because it's running the same 128-bit aggregated memory bus. To be honest, I don't have that much of a problem with a low-end GPU in a range coming out with 8 GB of video memory. There will be some instances where it can have an impact, as shown when the ill-optimised The Last of Us port initially launched and struggled on 8 GB GPUs. But The Last of UsPart 2showed that if the devs manage it correctly,even 8 GB can be enough for max settings. RTX 5060 (*unconfirmed) RTX 5060 Ti GPU GB206 GB206 TFLOPs 19 24 CUDA cores 3840 4608 SMs 30 36 RT cores (4th Gen) 30 36 Tensor cores (5th Gen) 120 144 Memory 8 GB GDDR7 16 GB / 8 GB GDDR7 Memory bus 128-bit 128-bit Memory speed *28 Gbps 28 Gbps Memory bandwidth 448 GB/sec 448 GB/sec Price $299 $429 (16 GB) / $379 (8 GB) Release date May 19 April 16 AMD is also releasing new 8 GB graphics cards in this generation, with theRX 9060 XT, expected to launch atComputexthis week, coming in both 8 GB and 16 GB configurations. Although we still don't know what the price is going to be for that one. That leaves it open as to whether we're looking at competition for the RTX 5060 Ti or the RTX 5060 from a price perspective. Though we ought to be looking at Intel, too, when it comes to competition as theIntel Arc B580could provide some interesting price/performance comparisons to Nvidia's new card as well. That was a card I didn't much trust at launch, but it's drivers have definitely improved. It only remains to be seen what sort of state Nvidia's RTX 5060 launch drivers will be. Once I've got them installed and running through our benchmark suite, I'll be able to let you know below...",

In that presentation, Intel announced it is currently \"on track for production in H2 '25\" and will have a \"consumer-ready launch with OEMs beginning early '26\". This effectively means other companies can start producing hardware with Panther Lake chips in them then. Our first thought goes to handhelds, like the recentMSI Claw 8 AI+, which came loaded with the beefy mobile Lunar Lake chip. A Panther Lake-driven laptop could potentially skip a dedicated GPU to opt for an ultra-power-efficient iGPU too. In a real-time rendering and an AI application test,Tom's Hardwarereports that \"the silicon is healthy and on track for retail availability.\" In said presentation, Intel reportedly stated that Panther Lake chips combine the power efficiency of Lunar Lake with the performance of Arrow Lake-H. Intel reportedly also teased that the chips' iGPU will come with XMX graphics, but didn't elaborate on power past the fact that it will be closer to Lunar Lake than Arrow Lake. We don't yet have confirmation, but it's assumed that the iGPU will be based on Xe3 architecture, which is the same reported inIntel Arc Celestial discrete GPUs.

Video and article on PCWorld soon. pic.twitter.com/FyTZ05whfIMay 19, 2025 Notably, the actual chip was also shown in these early Computex 2025 presentations, with Wccftech noting it is split into five tiles, and that the compute tile (which is the largest of the five) \"features Cougar Cove P-Cores and Darkmont E-Cores\". The Panther Lake CPU specs that were shared featured 16 cores and 16 threads, and clocked a base speed of 2.0 GHz, which reportedly went up to 3.0 GHz in testing. Given this is early silicon, Wccftech reckons its final clock will go to 5.0 GHz or more. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The CPU they were shown also had 1.6 MB of L1, 24 MB of L2, and 18 MB of L3 cache—Lunar Lakes figures are 836 kB, 14 MB, and 12 MB respectively, so that's a notable increase in the total amount of cache, but don't forget that it has half the number of cores (four P, four E). Panther Lake, which is assumed to be named the Core Ultra 300 series, will reportedly come with three SKUs, intended for different product types. Based on tech leakerJaykihn0's claims, Wccftech reports that Panther Lake chips should have four P-Cores, with eight E-cores for the H variety SKUs, and four LP-E cores in all variants. Catch up withComputex 2025:We're stalking the halls of Taiwan's biggest tech show once again to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to offer. For graphics, there will be four 4 XE3 GPU cores in all but the most expensive SKU, which will have 12. The exact configurations are, of course, unconfirmed, but these would make sense. Wccftech was also shown Panther Lake-powered laptops but no handhelds yet, and reports AI performance was much stronger on these Panther Lake engineering samples than Lunar Lake, which is a big push for Intel's upcoming chip. Panther Lake is a major CPU built on Intel's own 18A processor technology. Given it's the first of its kind and Intel has bet quite a lot on its fab, 18A efficiency and power mean a lot for the future of Intel. So far, signs are looking good, and we've been looking forward toPanther Lake in a gaming handheldfor a while now. If Intel's early claims are true, it could make the future of gaming handhelds much more interesting, and iGPU-driven laptops could get a tidy boost to performance too.

    "article_text": "Hall effect and wireless connectivity. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Asushas been hitting the right notes with its gaming keyboards as of late, and it looks to be going in a good direction with its latest announcement, the ROG Falcata. This is a split ergonomic gaming keyboard, and I've had a quick bash on its Hall effect keys over atComputex 2025. First off, this is a 75% layout. That means it has most of the keys you'd expect on a traditional keyboard but lacks a few excessive switches for a little space-saving, including the numpad. The other space-saving feature is, of course, the fact you can break this keyboard in two and only use the left-hand side, freeing up more room for egregious mouse movements. I don't know about you, but I tend to make do with a mouse pad's amount of space besides my normal keyboard, but I do nonetheless enjoy a split keeb for its intended purpose: ergonomics. I only had a quick tap on the ROG Falcata at Asus HQ in Taiwan, but I did get to try out the removable feet that let you customise the fit to your hands/wrists. Essentially, each keyboard half has four screw holes, into which you can screw in feet of various sizes. You can get something similar to positive/negative tenting and a few good configurations, which is good to see from a 'gaming' ergo. It's less easily switched than some ergonomic keyboards with adjustable feet, as you have to unscrew them each time and replace to adjust, but it's slightly stealthier appearance than something extremely ergo, like theZSA Moonlander. Down the left-hand side sits a little multi-function wheel, and of course there's RGB lighting galore all over it. This is Asus, after all. Catch up withComputex 2025:We're stalking the halls of Taiwan's biggest tech show once again to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to offer. This is also a wireless keyboard, and with Hall effect keys, which is good to see becoming the norm. Hall effect means adjustable actuations, at the very least, and more gaming-specific features if the software allows it. I've not tried Asus' software for tweaking Hall effect yet, but it says the actuation is adjustable to 0.01 mm using its new ROG HFX V2 switches. These new switches are also widely compatible with regular keycaps you might buy separately today, according to Asus. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. All together, a neat-looking entry but we'll need longer with it to see if it's worthy of ourbest ergonomic gaming keyboardaccolade. Right now that's the long-standingKinesis Edge Freestyle RGB, which also offers a similarly split design, but lacks some of the more modern flare like the Asus, such as Hall effect and wireless connectivity.

    "article_text": "PlayStation is at it again. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Ahead ofStellar Blade's PC release in June, players have been greeted with the dreaded yet expected message: Some people won't have access to the PC release as it's region-locked in 130 countries. The full list of countries that won't have access to Stellar Blade's PC launch can be found onSteamDB, with six countries—Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Philippines, Russian Federation, and Vietnam—having no price set. While all the other countries outright prevent the game from being activated or purchased. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together The list also includes three Unknown country codes: AN, FX, and XD. AN stands for the Netherlands Antilles, but Dutch players can simply use their NL accounts to purchase the game. While FX represents Metropolitan France and XD is for Dubai, but again, players can just use their French accounts or UAE accounts, respectively. This list of countries lines up with PSN availability despite the developers' Shift Up previously saying in asocial media postthat \"PSN connecting is entirely optional and never required.\" But this wouldn't be the first time that a game is restricted by PSN despite not actually requiring its use. Earlier this year, PlayStation added aPSN restriction to Horizon Forbidden West10 months after its release, despite the game having no internet connection requirements. 🔸️We are closely discussing the region lock issue with the publisher and are doing our BEST to resolve most of it as soon as possible.🔸️As shown in the test chart below, the DRM has been hard tuned to maintain the same average frame rate, with even higher minimum frames in… pic.twitter.com/JDimvKiKteMay 16, 2025 PSN requirements are pretty controversial among the gaming community. It properly kicked off back whenSony forced it on Helldivers 2, and in response, players review-bombed the game,leaving over 200,000 negative reviews. Since then, Sony has tagged a PSN requirement onto all its PC releases likeGod of War: Ragnarok, which thengot review-bombedtoo. Needless to say, it's not a very popular practice, so why won't Sony let it go? Despite saying thatPSN accounts will be optional for playersto use, this only applies to those in countries where PSN accounts are available. PCG'sHarvey Randall has previously explainedall the reasons why this is the case, but in short, it's likely due to exchange rates. If a game is much cheaper in one country than another, there's more of a chance of key resellers taking advantage of the price difference and selling cheaper keys on the grey market. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Regardless of the reasons behind it, it's still an annoying practice, and one that the developers are going to try to fight against. \"We are closely discussing the region lock issue with the publisher, and we are doing our BEST to resolve most of it as soon as possible,\" Shift Up says in asocial media post. It seemingly took a lot of haggling for just thePSN requirement to be removed from Helldivers 2, so there's no telling whether the Stellar Blade devs will be able to pull this off, but it's definitely worth a try.

    "title": "Intel's next batch of CPUs might still be called Core Ultra 200S, possibly because the Arrow Lake refresh won't be much of a boost",
    "article_text": "Anybody want a bigger NPU? Anyone? Anyone? Bueller? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Over the years of producing CPUs, Intel has a long history of refreshing its current architecture, rather than wholesale replacing it. The updates typically offer higher clock speeds and occasionally a new feature or two, but they've always involved a new name for the processors. However, for the Arrow Lake refresh, it's being claimed that the tweaked chips will still be called Core Ultra 200S. Admittedly, it's just the one person making the claim, X-userJaykin(viaVideocardz), but they have a good track record when it comes to tech leaks and rumours. Jaykin also suggests that the Arrow Lake refresh will involve anupdated NPU(neural processing unit), courtesy of a larger SoC tile. ARL-S and ARL-HX refreshes should be Core Ultra 200-series. Preliminary.May 17, 2025 Both desktop and mobile variants of Arrow Lake (ARL-S and ARL-HX, respectively) will still have the same package size and, in the case of the former, will still use the LGA1851 socket. While that doesn't automatically mean your current Z890 or B850 motherboard will support the refreshed chips, there's a good chance it will. In previous years, when Intel launched a refreshed CPU line-up, it has always renamed the chips. So why would Team Blue stick with Core Ultra 200S? I suspect that it's because there will be no changes that affect their fundamental performance, such as higher clock speeds, more cores, or a faster memory system. If the only thing that's being improved is the NPU (possibly to ensure that Intel's chips now meet Microsoft's requirements for itsCopilot AI PC ecosystem), then the new processors would perform no better than the current ones do in games, content creation, and general use. Then again, the recently launchedCore 200S Boostfeature showed there is some scope for improving the performance of Arrow Lake without having to change various internal components. In other words, Intel could tweak all of the internal clocks and timings, plus add a larger NPU, and have a big enough difference in performance to warrant calling them Core Ultra 300S. After all, it was happy to refresh its Raptor Lake-powered Core 13th Gen series, call it Core 14th Gen, and barely change anything other than the boost clocks and power consumption. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. I suspect that Intel wants to keep Core Ultra 300S for its next generation of CPU architectures, namelyPanther Lakefor mobile platforms andNova Lakefor desktops, both targeted for release in 2026. Best CPU for gaming: The top chips from Intel and AMD.Best gaming motherboard: The right boards.Best graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits.Best SSD for gaming: Get into the game ahead of the rest. These are expected to be significantly better in performance than the current Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake processors, and given the lacklustre reception the latter received, it makes sense to keep the new name for something that's (hopefully) a lot better. One concern that I have is whether the Arrow Lake refresh is going to be the last processor that supports Intel's LGA1851 socket. If it is and the refreshed chips aren't any better in gaming, for example, then it would be really disappointing to see. AMD wasstill releasing CPUsfor its AM4 socket last year, a goodeight yearsafter it first appeared, and while Intel is well-known for changing its sockets every couple of processor generations, you'd think it would take a leaf from Team Red's book of design and make something that lasts. Of course, changing the socket forces OEMs and system builders to push out entirely new platforms, which in turn helps Intel shift a whole heap of processors. Hopefully, the Arrow Lake refresh does offer more than just a larger NPU because, as things currently stand, I wouldn't recommend that any PC gamer buy a Core Ultra 200S chip. It's not bad, but regardless of what your budget is or what your use scenario for the processor is, there arefar better CPUsout there to choose from.

    "article_text": "That's putting it lightly. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Baldur's Gate 3 received a line of pre-painted miniatures recently, andthey've all got faces only a Mindflayer could love. Produced by mini makers Wizkids in partnership with Wizards of the Coast (I'd like to note that, obviously, Larian didn't have much to do with these abominations sinceHasbro now owns the rights to those characters) a wave of disappointment swept through customers because—well, just take a look. In what I can only describe as reckoning for ol' Wizkids, the mini-making company is now offering full refunds, as per anannouncement on its website: \"We missed the mark on this goal with the D&D Icons of the Realms: Baldur’s Gate 3 Character Boxed Set. If you purchased this set through our online stores, we will be offering a full refund to those who are unsatisfied with their set. To begin a request, please contact customerservice@wizkids.com.\" If you happened to buy a box from a retailer, Wizkids says you can \"return it at your point of purchase for a full refund\"—the company also says it'll be providing replacements if you put in a request for one, though I doubt it'll be flooded by those. \"Please accept our sincerest apologies for the frustration and disappointment these quality issues caused our customers,\" the apology concludes. \"We, too, feel the same as the final product did not meet our expectations or that of our Wizards of the Coast partner. Our teams are working to find the best solutions to resolve this for all involved and to work with you, our customers, to fix this. \"We appreciate your patience as we focus on getting back to those affected and helping them with their refunds in a timely manner. \" Ask most familiar with the TTRPG space, though, and you'll find this is less of a shock embarrassment and more of a containment breach—mostpre-painted miniatures aren't particularly quality, especially not for the price-point Wizkids was offering them at. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Painting small figures with accurate details is a time-consuming and costly task, so a pre-painted mini is either very expensive or, well, melty-faced. At $50 a box with 7 miniatures inside (around $7.10 a figure), these things were never going to look great. However, that means precious little to someone buying a product—especially if they were brought into the hobby by Baldur's Gate 3, and aren't familiar with the rep pre-painted minis have. While Wizkids shares plenty of the blame, especially for someegregiously misleading promotional material that circulatedbeforehand, I also think it's a misstep by Wizards of the Coast, and yet anotherfundamental misunderstandingof the IP it has on its hands. Yes, people will want miniatures of the Baldur's Gate 3 cast—but they'd obviously want them as collector's items that celebrate and represent the characters well, not something that looks like a botched True Polymorph. There's totally a market for cheap and muddily-faced pre-painted minis for folks who just want some starting bits for a game, and don't mind a few misplaced facial features—because hey, you'll be staring at them over a mountain of snacks anyway. But the Baldur's Gate 3 cast are near and dear to people's hearts, and if you're gonna make an official line of minis with them, I'd maybe not go for the company whose products have been 'affordable, but smeary-faced' for some time.

    "title": "I'm actually jealous of the workstation that gets to use this Maxsun graphics card containing two Intel Arc GPUs and 48 GB of VRAM",
    "article_text": "Dual-GPU cards might be dead for gaming but they're alive and well for AI inference. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Two GPUs on a single graphics card… now where have I heard this one before? Intel and its partner Maxsun have stuffed two of its new Arc Pro B60 chips onto a single GPU, and yes, it's for AI. If you're a PC gamer of a certain age, you may remember a few choice graphics cards that were made up of, more or less,twographics cards on a single PCB, like the AMD Radeon R9 295X2. These contained all the components required to run the chips practically independently of one another, using drivers to combine their power to render a game. These cards are long-extinct now, due to a lack of the necessary Crossfire/SLI support and companies favouring large single GPUs instead. This new Intel and Maxsun dual-GPU card is bringing this concept back, sort of. The Maxsun dual-GPU card combines two Arc Pro B60 cards into a single relatively slim shroud. Slim considering it's a dual-GPU card, anyways. It's a bit of a beast for VRAM capacity, as each GPU has access to 24 GB of memory, making for 48 GB total per card. That's 96 GB for a two-card system, which is exactly what Intel was showing off over at Computex 2025. Intel showed off the Maxsun card in an inference machine, alongside a XEON CPU. It was running an AI model locally—these models are huge and easily swallow up most gaming card's VRAM capacity—but what was more impressive was the fact it only had two physical cards in the system. It was sat alongside another system using four, and both shared 96 GB of RAM. Unfortunately I couldn't peek the temps but I suspect those dual-GPU cards require decent cooling. The Pro B60 is a new arrival into the workstation lineup for Intel, alongside the B50. It's made up of a G21 GPU, the same found in the Arc B580, but with double the memory attached using the clamshell method also used on the RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB variant. That means 24 GB memory, 456 GB/s bandwidth, 20 Xe-cores, and a 120-200 W TBP. Catch up withComputex 2025:We're on the ground at Taiwan's biggest tech show to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to show. Oh and to run both GPUs over a single PCI slot, a x16 PCIe 5.0 connection is bifurcated into two x8 connections, which is ample enough bandwidth. Speaking to Intel atComputex 2025, I can confirm there is no 24 GB variant planned for gamers. There's just no real benefit for gamers with this configuration, I'm told. It's only for AI, folks. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Will we ever see a return to dual-card configurations for gaming? Not unless someone figures out a way to have the two cards appear as one without a large amount of driver development work. That was the thorn in previous efforts with Crossfire and SLI, which saw AMD and Nvidia valiantly try to get dual-card systems working smoothly in many games and often still end up with shaky experience. All the major GPU companies would undoubtedly like to find the perfect, driver-free solution, but we're not at a loss for performance with the largest individual GPUs around today and I doubt its development is high on the priorities list.

    "article_text": "One of the game's biggest challenges is finally being removed. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Cozy sandbox castle builderTiny Gladehas announced that its next update is currently in the works, and a number of new features are being added. As detailedin a post shared to the Steam page, the update has \"accumulated quite a few goodies\". But, we don't know when exactly this update will be coming. So for now, we just have to stare lovingly at what we've got. The first addition is cobblestone paths, which are certainly welcome in any medieval city. We're not being limited to one style either. Three paths are currently being worked on, so you'll be able to choose whether you want larger stones, neat curved rows of square stones, or mismatched clusters. The choice is already overwhelming. But if you don't want to pick between the three, you don't have to. You'll be able to blend every variant of cobblestone with existing paths, which also goes for each style of stone. But the second thing featured in the announcement is what I'm most excited for. Stairs. Yes, Tiny Glade does technically already have the ability to make stairs in the game but they are incredibly tedious to craft. You have to use either platforms or paths to build them step by step rather than having the option to place them automatically. Now, however, it looks like we'll be able to draw staircases like we can with walls and adjust them to suit our buildings. The post showcasing this element does explicitly state that \"stairs are the biggest and most complicated change we've done since Tiny Glade's launch\" before sharing that it has taken five prototypes to get to a point where they are happy enough to share it. It's also expressed that the gif shown on the Steam announcement is still a work in progress, and things are bound to change before the update rolls out. Tiny Glade's update will also feature additional smaller elements but they are being \"kept as a surprise.\" Let's face it, nothing is going to be more exciting than finally being able to build a winding staircase with the click of a few buttons. I might finally take on the daily challenges once I don't have to meticulously glue walls together in the shape of steps.

    "title": "Jensen says 'even Crysis' can run on Nvidia's RTX Pro Server enterprise platform and now I kinda want one just for funsies",
    "article_text": "It'd make a hell of a showpiece gaming rig, wouldn't it? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has just delivered the opening keynote atComputex 2025, and it was a little light on PC gaming reveals. No great surprise, as Computex has become known for Nvidia's AI-related announcements in recent years, but there was still the odd tidbit for us gamers to pick up on—including the revelation that\"even Crysis\" runs on Nvidia's new RTX Pro Server enterprise platform. TheNvidia RTX Pro Serveris primarily made up of eightRTX Pro 6000 Blackwell Server EditionGPUs linked together, with a total of 30 PFLOPS of FP4 AI performance, three PFLOPS of RTX graphics performance, and 800 GB of GPU memory total, with 12 TB/s of bandwidth. \"Everything that runs in the world today, should run [on] here\" said the leather-jacketed one, standing proudly over an open system. \"No matter the modality, every single model that we know of, every application that we know of, should run on this. \"In fact, evenCrysisworks on here... so anybody who's a GeForce gamer...\" he said, pausing for effect and a stony silence from the crowd. \"There are no GeForce gamers in the room?\", he joked, to laughter and applause. Well there's one here, Jensen, and if you're offering... Of course, the RTX Pro Server will likely be immensely expensive, and is really not designed for gaming use in and of itself—even if it does possess some immense GPU horsepower. Never mind that Crysis was never coded to take advantage of that many GPUs, although there's probably some emulation trickery that might help. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. But as overpowered gaming PCs go, it'd make a pretty gargantuan talking point—although you may need to rewire your house to hook one up to the power grid. Catch up withComputex 2025:We're stalking the halls of Taiwan's biggest tech show once again to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to offer. And yes, the\"can it run Crysis\"jokes continue, long into 2025. At some point I'm sure we'll find another target for our faux-ire, but the near-18-year-old offering still makes a convenient scapegoat for our hardware-demanding woes. What I want to know is, what kind of frames can you expect in something more modern, likeOblivion Remastered? That particular game broughtDave's RTX 5090 to its knees at 4K, so perhaps we should break out the big guns and do some benchmarking on Nvidia's new mega-rig. I jest, of course, but wouldn't that be something? Now we just need to arrange shipping. I don't suppose an overnight courier is available for a reasonable fee, is it? Nope, didn't think so.

    "title": "Is it a bird, is it a plane? No, it's Nvidia's new Taiwanese office",
    "article_text": "As Computex 2025 \"product\" reveals go, it's a pretty good one. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Nvidia's Computex 2025 keynote was mainly focussed on AI factories, AI agents, and well, AI everything. However, the biggest showstopper was left until last—a CGI depiction ofNvidia's new Taiwanese office, \"Constellation\", flying into the Earth's atmosphere as a Star Trek-style spaceship. Yep, you read that right. Jensen announced the new office as \"one of the largest products we've ever built, and it's parked outside,\" before stepping off of the stage as the intro to Star Trek: The Nvidia Adventu... I mean, the office was revealed. In a keynote otherwise filled with various AI-related reveals and proclamations, it was certainly the most exciting moment of the whole affair. I'll be honest and say that while I was expecting a Taiwanese office reveal at some point in the presentation, a little part of me was hoping that Nvidia had actually gone full sci-fi and begun the construction of a spaceship, and I was a little disappointed when it landed and turned into an office building. Don't tease me like that, Nvidia. You know we're all nerds back here. Still, it's a pretty office building, at least. The site for Nvidia Constellation will be based in Taipei, and Jensen confirmed that construction would begin as soon as possible, because \"we need the office space.\" \"As you know, we have been growing. And all of our partnerships, with you, have been growing,\" Huang said to the crowd. \"The number of engineers we have here in Taiwan has been growing. And so we are growing beyond the limits of our current office. And so I'm going to build them a brand new Nvidia Taiwan office.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"We've also been selecting the sites, and all of the mayors and all of the different cities have been very kind to us. I think we got some nice deals.\" Well, it would be silly to assume otherwise. Still, Huang joked that the site seemed \"kind of expensive,\" but \"prime real estate is prime real estate.\" Catch up withComputex 2025:We're stalking the halls of Taiwan's biggest tech show once again to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to offer. \"We have negotiated the transfer of the lease from the current owners\", Huang continued. \"However, I understand that, in order for the mayor to approve that lease, he wanted to know whether the people of Taipei approve of us building a large, beautiful, Nvidia Constellation here. Do you?\" The audience responded with much clapping, of course. That'll be that, then. Huang also joked that the crowd should call the mayor personally, although didn't provide a number. Probably for the best. The Constellation naming (and spaceship theming) fits with two of Nvidia's other sites,Nvidia Voyager and Nvidia Endeavour. I suppose it was too much to hope for an Nvidia Enterprise, but I guess the name would be a bit confusing given how important enterprise-level computing is toNvidia's bottom line. Better not to muddy the search terms, ey? Anyway, fancy new office, no actual spaceship. Maybe next year. Fingers crossed.

    "title": "Today's Wordle answer for Monday, May 19",
    "article_text": "Get all the help you need with today's Wordle. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We've got a fresh clue for today'sWordleWin your first Wordle of the week as fast and easily as you like with our help. Even in a single row if you feel like it—today's answer is only a click away if the idea of filling your first row with green letters appeals to you. Or you could relax and take your time instead, knowing the May 19 (1430) hint is here if you need it. Your game, your choice. Today's Wordle was pretty generous with the clues, but didn't really come together for far too long. I got the first letter sorted out pretty quickly, and even had a floating yellow to go with it, but it took a lot of greys and wrong ideas before I found my groove. You can skip all of that fuss with our clue, if you like. Today's answer can refer to the \"height\" of a musical note, as well as the grassy fields sports can take place on. No, there is not a double letter in today's puzzle. A good starting word can be the difference between victory and defeat with the daily puzzle, but once you've got the basics, it's much easier to nail down those Wordle wins. And as there's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day, here are a few tips to help set you on the right path: There's no racing against the clock with Wordle so you don't need to rush for the answer. Treating the game like a casual newspaper crossword can be a good tactic; that way, you can come back to it later if you're coming up blank. Stepping away for a while might mean the difference between a win and a line of grey squares. Let's get started. The answer to the May 19 (1430) Wordle isPITCH. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Past Wordle answers can give you some excellent ideas for fun starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. They are also a good way to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer is unlikely to be repeated. Here are some recent Wordle answers: Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day, and you'll need to work out which secret five-letter word is hiding inside them to keep up your winning streak. You shouldstart with a strong wordlike ARISE, or any other word that contains a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You'll also want to avoid starting words with repeating letters, as you're wasting the chance to potentially eliminate or confirm an extra letter. Once you hit Enter, you'll see which ones you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the dailyWordlepuzzle to give readers a hint each and every day. Her Wordle streak is truly mighty. Somehow Kerry managed to get away with writing regular features onold Japanese PC games, telling today's PC gamers about some of the most fascinating and influential games of the '80s and '90s.

    "title": "Five new Steam games you probably missed (May 19, 2025)",
    "article_text": "Sorting through every new game on Steam so you don't have to. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. 2025 games: Upcoming releasesBest PC games: All-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest MMOs: Massive worldsBest RPGs: Grand adventures On an average day about a dozen new games are released on Steam. And while we think that's a good thing, it can be understandably hard to keep up with. Potentially exciting gems are sure to be lost in the deluge of new things to play unless you sort through every single game that is released on Steam. So that’s exactly what we’ve done. If nothing catches your fancy this week, we've gathered thebest PC gamesyou can play right now and a running list of the2025 gamesthat are launching this year. Steam ‌page‌‌Release:‌ May 17Developer:‌ Galla Kulebra is a gorgeous puzzle-centric adventure game set in a Latin American inspired afterlife. The protagonist is some kind of snake skeleton, but they're anicesnake skeleton who has taken it upon themselves to help the inhabits of Limbo come to terms with their post-life existence. This can be tricky because in Limbo time loops, so every day its inhabitants must learn everything anew,exceptfor the things that prove memorable on a heart- and soul level. This is effective a modern take on the point 'n' click adventure, with lavish Paper Mario-inspired cut-out art and some amusing time mechanics reminiscent of Majora's Mask. Steam‌ ‌page‌Release:‌ May 14Developer:‌ Fallen Tree Games Ltd From the creators of American Fugitive comes this hard-boiled cop drama set in a fictional 1980s American city. The topdown point of view may be reminiscent of (a much more graphically advanced) OG Grand Theft Auto, but The Precinct has some interesting cop sim aspects that maybe brings it closer toThis Is The Police.Yes, there are \"intense car and helicopter chases\" and tactical shootouts, but you'll also be on the look out for \"parking infractions\", and when things get hectic it's better to call in your cop colleagues rather than try to solve (or shoot) the problem alone. It looks ambitious, and early user reviews are glowing. Steam‌ ‌page‌‌Release:‌ May 14Developers:‌ Cosmic VoidI know I mustn't be alone in feeling fed up with cyberpunk, but pixel art cyberpunk is another matter entirely. Neon Hearts City is a retro-styled point 'n' click adventure following the travails of a private investigator on the hunt for a missing person. Somehow this simple set up is complicated by the plight of androids, a floating prison island, and a mysterious tower in the ocean. I'm sure it all comes together, as Cosmic Void adventures normally do, but whether it does or not, gosh, do those pixels sing. Steam pageRelease:‌ May 14Developer:‌ Slormite Studios Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. This pixel ARPG has been in early access since 2021 and apparently, now in 1.0 four years later, it's something loot grind fiends are going to want to check out. In fact, reading about the various skill trees and levelling systems makes me a bit dizzy: all active abilities have skill trees, there are over 150 elemental skills and passives, and Legendary items have \"more than 200 unique affixes\", among other things. Someone in the comments describes it as \"the Disgaea of the ARPG genre\" which sounds pretty intimidating to me. There are three main classes (a knight, huntress or mage), dungeon crawling aplenty, and—probably most excitingly for me—it's entirely single player, so it's definitely balanced for lone warriors. Steam‌ ‌page‌‌Release:‌ May 13Developer:‌ FarkasInteractive As usual, there were a lot of new horror games on Steam this week (including the brilliantLabyrinth of the Demon King) but Manivore manages to stand out among them. Why? Look at the guy in the thumbnail above: he's creepy AF. And in this first-person affair you'll be investigating his diabolically evil crimes. Oh, and you only have a camera, which makes a dim kind of sense because you're an investigator but also: I'm not going near that guy without at least a broom. Features puzzles, lots of tense stealth, and—if you're really unlucky—cannibalism. Shaun Prescott is the Australian editor of PC Gamer.

    "title": "In its latest update, Enshrouded's terrifying monsters have players asking 'are we the baddies?'",
    "article_text": "Thralls of Twilight might just be the best Enshrouded update yet. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Enshrouded's latest update, \"Thralls of Twilight,\" could be its best yet, filling the game with terrifying new monsters and spicing up night-time adventures with new items and vaults. I've been playing Enshrouded since its early access launch, but none of its updates have caught my attention likeThralls of Twilight. If you haven't tried Enshrouded yet, there's never been a better time to give it a shot. For starters, Thralls of Twilight took Embervale's deadly Shroud zones to a whole new level with major landscape improvements and a slew of new monsters straight out of the realm of cosmic horror. As someone who no longer bats an eye at the original zombie-like monsters crawling the Shroud, these new terrors are a welcome change of pace, especially since Keen Games also added new items and loot exclusive to the Shroud. Fighting those creepy crawlies is more exciting now, too, thanks to new weapon gems. Now some high-rarity weapons will have a gem slot where you can equip various gems dropped by powerful NPCs. You have to find a Gem Forge to add or remove gems, but your reward is a customizable magic weapon. Speaking of customization, Thralls of Twilight also introduced armor tinting, so you can now customize all of your armor using a variety of color schemes, similar to the armor customization in V Rising. It's a minor change, but one I'm excited to see (it also makes it easier to tell your co-op teammates apart when players are wearing the same armor set). While all of that is exciting, possibly the most important part of Thralls of Twilight is how it totally transforms nighttime in Embervale. There are now patrols of enemies that wander the map at night, certain gatherables that only appear at night, and even vaults you can only open after the sun's gone down. Vastly improved lighting throughout the game makes it much easier to travel after nightfall, as well. On top of all that, Thralls of Twilight brings a little extra spice to Enshrouded's lore. Atrailer for the updateis narrated by one of the game's monsters, told fromtheirperspective. It recasts players as the vicious killers that must be stopped. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Some players might see the trailer as satirical, especially the bits about \"vanity\" and \"excess,\" which could be a humorous nod to some of theextravagant bases players have builtin Enshrouded. While I got a chuckle out of that myself, the trailer and the introduction of so many new monsters also hint that Enshrouded's lore might be more complex than we thought. The monsters plaguing Embervale are supposedly mutations created from the Shroud, which emerged from the abandoned Elixir Wells all over the map. The Shroud and all its monsters are basically a corruption that the Flameborn (the players) must heal to bring the world back from demise. 2025 games: Upcoming releasesBest PC games: All-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Thralls of Twilight brings a little more texture to that story by hinting at some level of unity on the monsters' side that we haven't really seen thus far. At the very least, it reinforces that the creatures from the Shroud are hellbent on spreading their corruption and see the Flameborn as the real monsters. Regardless of whose side you're on, you should check out the new cosmic horror baddies and much-needed lighting improvements in Enshrouded's Thralls of Twilight update. It's currently still in early access, but Keen Games plans tolaunch the 1.0 release in spring 2026.

    "title": "There's a unique game over in Baldur's Gate 3 you can only get by rolling 20 on a bunch of Constitution saving throws, then being an absolute dunderhead",
    "article_text": "Another unlikely outcome foreseen by Larian. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There are a lot of unique game overs inBaldur's Gate 3you can only discover in extremely specific circumstances. Maybe you fail a Wisdom saving throw and a dying mind flayer eats your brain. Maybe you taunt the god-queen of the githyanki and she wishes you out of existence. (Yes, I learned about those ones the hard way.) YouTuber SlimX has added another to the list in a video compiling hidden secrets of BG3. This one you can only find in act three, after entering the city of Baldur's Gate. There's a portcullis leading to the upper city you can't approach, because when you do a stunning effect teleports you back a few steps. You're only allowed into the upper city during the climax, after you've gathered all the Netherstones that will protect you from the Elder Brain who would otherwise dominate you, and you get there by a different route accessed from beneath the city. The stunning effect, which is called \"mindbroken\", is a Constitution saving throw with a difficulty of 99. You need to roll a natural 20 to pass it, and then it triggers again and again just in case you fluked the roll. However, SlimX has some loaded dice (by which I mean access to Cheat Engine), and shows what happens if you pass that test every time. There's an entire bespoke dialogue you'll only hear by passing all those tests and making it to the gate. It's a bit busted, with subtitles that have percentage symbols in them, but it still works. The Elder Brain tells you to approach and yield, and your extremely trustworthy best friend the Emperor tells you not to do that until after you've finished the fetch quest to collect the Netherstones. You've got to eat your vegetables first, kiddo. Ignore the Emperor's advice and approach the gate, and you'll be mind-controlled by the Elder Brain, and chastised by the Emperor to make it even worse. It's an immediate game over that you can only find by being lucky enough to pass a heap of impossible rolls and then dumb enough to face the final boss unprepared. Like theultra rare game over you can only get by losing a vital Netherstone, it's impressive that Larian even bothered to include this possibility. Stumbling across something like this game over demands a kind of perverse dedication, but it turns out that perversity is something Baldur's Gate 3 fans have in abundance.

    "article_text": "US lawmakers are worried about Apple's deal with Alibaba When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Trump administration and Congress are concerned aboutApple's deal with Alibaba to power some of the AI features oniPhonesin China, noting potential privacy concerns (viaThe New York Times). Worries about data sharing and national security implications have been raised, with the potential legal requirements for Apple and Alibaba to adhere to Chinese regulator rules central to the discussion. Moreover, only Alibaba has publicly confirmed the agreement, with Apple remaining silent – this could indicate potential uncertainty or an unfinished deal, or it could just be a typical Apple move of keeping developments under tight wraps until the final moment. The deal is being scrutinized amid ongoing US-China tensions, with concerns about aiding China's AI development and improving Chinese military AI capabilities both noted. \"Alibaba is a poster child for the Chinese Communist Party’s military-civil fusion strategy, and why Apple would choose to work with them on A.I. is anyone’s guess,\" Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois proclaimed. Apple has already dropped a deal with Chinese chipmaker YMTC over pressure from the US, and the Cupertino tech giant is also facing challenges from the trade war-induced tariffs and supply chain shifts out of China, with industry experts warning of sharp price hikes for consumers partaking in the next refresh cycle. However, China is the company's second-largest market, accounting for around one-fifth of its sales, highlighting the importance of a deal so as not to miss out against local smartphone makers. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The US administration has considered restricting US companies from doing business with the likes of Alibaba and other Chinese firms, but no details have been confirmed. Although the company has sought to diversify its supply chain, President Trump has criticizedTim Cookfor increasing production in India, urging domestic US manufacturing instead – one of the President's ultimate goals. Ultimately, Apple risks issues whichever way the deal swings, either missing out on millions of Chinese sales or potentially serious implications within the US. Apple had a 13% smartphone market share in China during the first three months of 2025 (viaCanalys), putting it several paces behind Xiaomi, Huawei, OPPO and vivo. \"The US smartphone market is expected to experience considerable volatility over the next two to three quarters, impacted by inventory corrections and weakening consumer confidence,\" Canalys Research Manager Le Xuan Chiewexplained.

    "article_text": "AI isn’t your product, but AI can power your purpose, Dell CEO says When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The founder and CEO ofDellTechnologies has urged businesses of all sizes to fully embrace the potential offered by AI in order to stay competitive and thrive ahead of the competition. Delivering the opening keynote atDell Technologies World 2025, Michael Dell warned how, \"the real danger is staying still,” as he highlighted several ways AI can benefit firms. \"AI is the new electricity - and Dell is the grid powering this transformation,\" he declared. During the keynote, the founder guided us along “Dell Technologies Way”, where the company’s services and systems power a wide range of businesses, industries and individuals alike. “Our street is alive with your energy, and yes - your creativity and your data,” he declared, “whether you’re developing cancer treatments, or growing a business, data is at the center of everything, everywhere, all of the time.” This included the company’s “AI Factory” platform, which saw its second generation unveiled as part of a long-standing partnership withNvidia. “For most of us…AI isn’t your product, but AI can power your purpose,” Dell added, “you don’t need your own Colossus, but you do need AI, and we’re taking all the learnings from these massive systems to make AI easier for you.” Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! “From AI PCs to small, domain-specific models running on the edge to the planetary scale AI data centers, we’ve got you covered.” Dell noted how over 75% of enterprise data will soon be created and processed at the edge - “and AI will follow the data - not the other way around.” \"The future of AI will be decentralized, low-latency and hyper-efficiency - and that's why Dell is pioneering the edge AI revolution, bringing real-time intelligence to wherever the data lives.” \"Here at Dell, we love data,” he added, “we store it, we protect it, we organize it, and we transform it into actions and insights that drive human progress - and turbocharged by AI, that engine of progress is going faster than ever before,\" he added. “The pace of innovation is at Mach 3 - we’re creating the future.” Mike Moore is Deputy Editor at TechRadar Pro.

    "article_text": "Programmers bore the brunt of Microsoft’s layoffs in its home state When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Microsoftrecently confirmed around 6,000 to 7,000 job cuts globally, including an estimated 2,000 redundancies in its home state of Washington. It's now come to light that over 40% of the Washington layoffs were related to software engineering (817 roles) (viaBloomberg), with the company previously stating that the layoffs were part of a broader cost cutting effort and a shift in investments into AI. Together with software engineers, the heaviest affected roles in Washington were product management (373 roles) and technical program management (218 roles), with business program management (55 roles), customer experience program management (44 roles) and product design (31 roles) also on the table. Despite the clear and ongoing need for software engineers in an increasingly software-defined world, it has become apparent that Microsoft deer appropriate to replace human workers with artificial intelligence. CEO Satya Nadella recently confirmed that AI now writes around one third of some projects' code, with the recent layoffs raising concerns about AI's effects on human workers and software developers. More broadly, this is a trend that we are seeing from other tech companies includingSalesforceand Workday. Google's CEO Sundar Pichai and Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg have also noted how much of their code is now written by AI. However, Microsoft has been criticized for mixed messaging. The company stated that the recent layoffs were primarily designed to reduce inefficiencies in middle management by removing unnecessary layers, and while 17% of the Washington redundancies did relate to managers, the loss of hundreds of software engineers raises alarm bells. Microsoft Principal Software Engineering Manager Mike Droettboom suggested in aLinkedIn postthat Python and open-source remain important roles even though companies are enacting major shifts: \"Looking around the room, I saw so many faces – some I have known for almost 25 years – coming together again with the same shared purpose, even as the company names on our badges change.\" Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! \"My heart goes out to the majority of the team that was laid off,\" Droettboom added.

    "title": "The curious case of the missing Alexa+ users – many are still waiting for 'early access'",
    "article_text": "Alexa's AI upgrade proves elusive for some When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Amazonunveiled Alexa+ with great fanfare more than six weeks ago, but there hasn't been much of a conversation among AI and voice assistant users about it since. My informal check of more than a dozen heavy Alexa users around the U.S. found none with access to it, and areportfromReuterssuggests it's far from the explosive event Amazon hyped it up to be at the debut presentation. Alexa+is supposed to be Amazon's infusion of AI into the eleven-year-old voice assistant. Using generative AI as a glow-up tool makes Alexa smarter, more useful, better at conversation, and just more intuitive as an assistant. Alexa+ is supposed to give the voice assistant many new and enhanced abilities to carry out your requests, such as processing multiple prompts at once and adapting to personalize its services. For instance, it should remember your dietary preferences while helping you order food. Invites for early access were meant to start going out in late March. Anecdotally, none have arrived, and a look around social media doesn't reveal any buzz either. Here at TechRadar, Alexa has, for weeks, been telling Editor at Large Lance Ulanoff that he's \"on the early access list,\" but there's still no sign of Alexa+. Even a Reddit postcovered by TechRadarhas since been removed from the website. Amazon begs to differ about that conclusion. The company is expressing confidence over the current and future release of Alexa+. \"Early Access to Alexa+ is ramping up. It’s already open to hundreds of thousands of customers, and we expect it to roll out to millions over the coming month,\" an Amazon spokesperson told TechRadar. \"This is no different than other invite programs we’ve run – we scale as we learn.\" As Amazon insists there is no slow-walking of Alexa+, the reasons behind an apparent delay aren't official either. That said, the Reuters report cited possible technical issues around the speed and accuracy of the revamped Alexa, as well as higher-than-preferred costs to run the new models. There's a bit of déjà vu here since Amazon made a lot of noise around an AI-enhanced Alexa in the fall of 2023, with an early preview promised in the weeks ahead that never actually happened. It's a far cry from the 2014 reveal of the originalAmazon Echo, which started shipping just a few weeks after it appeared on a stage. Amazon might feel the stakes are too high to prioritize timing over performance this time. If Alexa+ fumbles at launch, it could undercut Amazon’s entire smart home strategy. Worse, it might reinforce the idea that Alexa is more of a talking timer than a true digital assistant. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Amazon also recently made it soAlexa interactions are processed only in the cloud, removing the option for local processing. This change may boost Alexa+’s brainpower, but it also raises privacy flags that may need to be dealt with before a wide release. So, Alexa+ technically exists, and Amazon swears it’s being used. But you'll have to wait for a review of Alexa+ from someone's home. Until then, Alexa+ is more ghost than AI ghost in the machine.

    "title": "Qualcomm isn’t giving us new Snapdragon chips at Computex - but there’s a surprise waiting in September",
    "article_text": "Qualcomm announced basically nothing at Computex this year, but I think that's fine When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. 2024 was a banner year for Qualcomm at Computex, with the massive launch of itsSnapdragon X Elite laptop processorsputting it at the forefront of the event. In fact, Qualcomm’s keynote presentation last year was so impressive thatI declared them the winners of the event, with guest stars from makes of many of thebest laptopsincludingMicrosoft,HP,Dell, and Asus appearing alongside Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon. During today’s keynote atComputex 2025, things were a little more subdued. No exciting chip announcements here; instead, Amon got up on stage and discussed the (admittedly quite good) progress Qualcomm has made with the Snapdragon platform over the past year. A key factor he pointed to was the rapid growth in apps supported on the Snapdragon X Elite platform, along with the now 1,400+ games that are playable on Snapdragon laptops. Much like last year, Amon showcased Qualcomm’s impressive pull in the Windows computing market despite only entering the CPU fight withIntelandAMDlast year. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella made a brief appearance in the presentation, along with executives from Asus and HP. There were also some cheeky jabs at Intel andApple(the latter regarding the fact thatFortniteis fully playable on Snapdragon hardware), plus the usual slew of corporate drivel about how AI is revolutionizing… something. Honestly, I kind of tuned out for a bit there, until Amon fired up a laptop live on stage which proceeded to ask him (presumably human-curated) questions about Qualcomm’s AI hardware in a synthy robot voice. Pretty cool, I guess, but what really caught my attention was a teaser at the very end of the keynote presentation. So, while we got no new chips from Qualcomm at Computex, it looks like we now have a tacitly announced date for the next generation of Snapdragon X systems-on-a-chip (SoCs). It’s September 23: the date of Qualcomm’s own event, Snapdragon Summit, which will take place in Hawaii. What exactly are we getting in September? Amon wouldn’t say, only that “the revolution continues” and “I promise you that you will be impressed”. Still, there are some pretty reasonable assumptions that I’m willing to make here. While naming conventions are still a bit up in the air (since we’re only a single generation into Qualcomm’sWindows laptopchips), the current popular assumption is that the next-gen SoCs will use the ‘Snapdragon X2’ moniker, so I’ll just go with that here. I expect the initial launch to feature both X2 Elite and X2 Plus chips for the premium and midrange laptop markets, with broad integration across the majority of productivity laptop manufacturers; Dell’s XPS series, Asus’s Zenbooks,Lenovo’s Yoga line, the works. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. A ‘basic’ Snapdragon X2 chip will likely follow a bit further down the line (similar to howthe Snapdragon X chip was announced at CES in January this year), providing a more budget-conscious alternative. But I’m most interested inthe rumored 2nd-gen Snapdragon X Elite chip for desktops… Will we get a non-integrated Snapdragon X2 Elite? I wouldn’t quite bet on that; so far, we’ve only seen Snapdragon chips in compact PCs from the likes of Lenovo. So don’t expect to see a third option beyond Intel and AMD when it comes to motherboards for DIY PCs - but do expect more mini PCs and systems like thebest all-in-one computers. While ‘Team Q’ (still workshopping that name, I’m open to suggestions!) might be a relative newcomer to this particular industry arena, it’s made a serious impact. Cristiano Amon’s keynote included a somewhat surprising statistic: as of last quarter, Qualcomm now holds about 9% of the integrated processor market for the US and the top 5 European markets. Considering the fierce competition, it’s a seriously impressive showing. Given how much Qualcomm changed the game with the arrival of its first X Elite chips last year, I think the use of the word ‘revolution’ might actually be somewhat justified here. I don’t say that lightly; it’s a phrase that I’m frequently annoyed to see used to describe extremely marginal changes. But with Qualcomm finally making Windows onArmwork with the Snapdragon X series, I’ve got high hopes for whatever Team Q does next. Christian is TechRadar’s UK-based Computing Editor.

    "article_text": "How you'll get to Sesame Street When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Sesame Streethas a new address. When the iconic children's television program kicks off its 56th season later this year, it will be on Netflix, but, perhaps more importantly, it will also be on Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) in the US. The pairannounced the exclusive dealwith a brief and adorable video featuring Cookie Monster, who discovers and then eats the Netflix \"N\". A decade ago, when HBO (yes, it was just called \"HBO\" back then) announced its historic deal withSesame Streetto bring the series to its premium cable programming, it also shifted the show's original home to second-tier status. All first-run episodes appeared first on HBO and then, nine months later, the same episodes would air on the freely available PBS. Netflix's deal, however, fundamentally changes that equation. New season 56 episodes featuring Grover, Big Bird, Elmo, and the rest of the characters will air on Netflix and PBS at the same time. Essentially, this is two levels of good news for the beloved show: One,Sesame Street, whose future was no longer certain, has a popular and well-funded new home; and two, all youngsters and homes engaged in theSesame Streetstory, regardless of their access or financial status, will have full access to the season's show. Neither Netflix norSesame Streetis revealing the terms of the deal, but without Netflix's support, it was unclear ifSesame Streetwould survive. WhenI spoke to Sesame Street Execs a decade agoas they were inking the HBO deal, they revealed to me that viewers on PBS accounted for a small percentage of their funding. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. \"What people don’t understand is that PBS only funds less than 10% of production costs of show. The show was funded for many years by licensing income,\" said Jeff Dunn in 2015, who is now Executive Chairman at Sesame Workshop. The key to people buying content and products revolving around theSesame Streetfranchise and funding the non-profit Sesame Street Workshop, is a bigger audience devoted to its characters and themes. Netflix, which has roughly 310 million subscribers compared to Max's estimated 110 million, should help in that regard. The season 56Sesame StreetNetflix subscribers (and those watching on PBS) will encounter later this year will be quite different from previous editions. Netflix has also committed to developing games for Sesame StreetandSesame Street Mecha Builders. The streamer is planning to releaseSesame StreetSeason 56's 35 episodes in three batches on Netflix. It will also add some 90 hours of classic episodes to the platform. As for how many episodes that represents, we'll leave that to The Count to figure out.

    "article_text": "The high number of data centers is likely a major factor When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A new report has claimed the United States is now the largest source of spam emails in the world. VIPRE’s Q1 2025Email Threat Trends Report, the US was responsible for more than half (57%) of all spam sent worldwide during the first quarter of the 2025. VIPRE analyzed 1.45 billion emails for its report, focusing on the geolocation of the origin IP address found in email headers, rather than on domain extensions like .com. While there is no single cause, the scale of data center infrastructure in the US makes it difficult to enforce spam regulations effectively and results in greater numbers of entry points for spam emails to spread. With even more data centers being built across the US, this is a problem that’s only going to get worse in the coming years. The report notes that of the spam analyzed, 67% was classified as malicious, linked to phishing or malware. Callback phishing is rising fast, accounting for nearly one in five phishing attempts. Cybercriminals also appear to be opting for simpler, human-focused methods over more complex, technical ones.

SVG attachments were found to be climbing in popularity among attackers, coming in second place just behind PDFs, as they can be used to trick users into visiting malicious sites. The manufacturing sector is the top target for email-based attacks, with retail and finance sharing second place. VIPRE says the malware landscape has shifted recently, with the XRed backdoor-type malware family taking the top spot ahead of the second-most prominent malware family (Lumma) by a factor of three. StealC, AgentTesla, and Redline followed behind. “There’s a clear shift in cybercriminals’ preference towards low-tech, high-impact, human-centric tactics. This demands a fundamental rethink of email security - one that addresses the human element as vigilantly as the technological,” said Usman Choudhary, Chief Product and Technology Officer, VIPRE Security Group. “With cybercriminals mastering the art of human deception, and crafting phishing attacks that bypass conventional defenses, email security in turn demands an approach that weaponizes cybercriminals’ own actions and uses their patterns to create a unique, future-proofed response,” he added.

This firm is a business partner of payroll company ADP which, in turn, worked with Broadcom. In fact, the chip giant was in the process of switching payroll providers when the incident happened, meaning it almost dodged that bullet. However, in December 2024, the two firms discovered the stolen data on the internet. “Because the data taken by the criminal actor was in an unstructured format, definitively determining which employees were impacted and, for each employee, which data fields were disclosed, was a lengthy process for BSH/ADP, and this information was not made available to Broadcom until May 12, 2025,” it was explained. 60% off for Techradar readers With Aura's parental control software, you can filter, block, and monitor websites and apps, set screen time limits.

    "article_text": "OLED screen? Sign me up... When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Computex 2025is well underway, which means there's plenty of new tech ranging from new desktop PC hardware to portable devices – and we have a new lineup for the latter which is intent on improving productivity. HPhasannounced its new OmniBook 5 Series, with theOmniBook 5 14-inch and the OmniBook 5 16-inch laptopsproviding significant leaps in processing power (using Snapdragon X Plus and X chips) and visual quality; most importantly, HP claims its new series has 'the world's longest battery life in a consumer AI PC notebook'. As per HP's blog, each laptop will feature up to 34 hours of battery life, which should ensure consumers get the most out of their activities. When running low on battery, you'll be able to get right back up to speed with HP Fast Charge, which charges you up to 50% in just 30 minutes. These impressive claims may not come as a surprise, since Qualcomm's Snapdragon processors are ideal for battery efficiency, providing exceptional performance that rivals some ofApple's M-based chips while ensuring battery life is at its best. It's also worth noting that both laptops will haveOLEDdisplays, capable of providing excellent picture quality thanks to deep black levels stemming from a high contrast ratio. This will be ideal for video content, including creative tasks that require great color accuracy – and this is further supported with a 95.3 DCI-P3 color gamut and 0.2ms response time. Perhaps the biggest highlight here, beyond power and capabilities, is the pricing. The HP OmniBook 14 is anticipated to launch in July, starting at $799 via HP's online store. Its counterpart, the HP OmniBook 16, is also expected to launch in July, starting at $849 – and both of these are affordable prices, considering the benefits available here. At those sensible asking prices, OLED laptops that have great battery life and performance are all I need – and that's why I think this new OmniBook 5 Series is worth keeping an eye on. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Despite the concerns of burn-in and text fringing (which have been improved with next-gen OLED displays), using an OLED display has single-handedly uplifted my enjoyment while gaming and watching movies. And if you're lucky like me, you won't actually notice text fringing when working. In myLenovo Yoga Slim 7x review, I highlighted how it's one of the best OLED displays I've ever seen; I won't be surprised if I end up saying the same about HP's new OmniBook Series. With the claims of battery life that rival other Snapdragon laptops, it's a no-brainer starting at $749 – and the Snapdragon X Plus (8-core version) features 45 NPU TOPS for AI applications and tasks.

    "article_text": "You can share your device's location without sharing your device's location When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Researchers have come up with a new method to “prove” where you’re located, without actually having to sharesensitive location data. If adopted, the method could have major implications for businesses such as ride-sharing or delivery, smart cities and public transport, or digital advertising and marketing. The paper, presented recently at the 2025 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, was drafted by authors Jens Ernstberger (Technical University of Munich), Chengru Zhang (University of Hong Kong), Luca Ciprian (Technical University of Munich), Philipp Jovanovic (University College London), and Sebastian Steinhorst (Technical University of Munich). It is called “Zero-Knowledge Location Privacy via Accurate Floating-Point SNARKs”. 60% off for Techradar readers With Aura's parental control software, you can filter, block, and monitor websites and apps, set screen time limits. Parents will also receive breach alerts, Dark Web monitoring, VPN protection, and antivirus. Preferred partner (What does this mean?) Simplified, it works like this: instead of revealing their exact location (as is the case today), the user creates a cryptographic commitment (essentially, the data is locked behind a crypto key). The data cannot be changed, but also cannot be viewed by third parties. Then, the device runs a zero-knowledge proof algorithm, proving that the data locked behind the crypto key is accurate. Ultimately, the verifier (which can be an app, or a server) checks the zero-knowledge proof, and because of the cryptographic properties, they can confidently confirm the location meets the condition without ever seeing the exact coordinates. The method’s key limitation is that it doesn’t inherently guarantee the authenticity of the location data. Since the system relies on the device, or user, to provide the location data in the first place, it can still be spoofed (if the GPS data is fake, for example). In the paper, the researchers proposed a solution for verifying that a location proof isn’t forged, which involves network communication with a third party (for example, the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals). In that case, data on where the device says it is located would no longer be non-interactive.

    "title": "Sony tipped to stretch its lead in compact video cameras with new FX2 – and it could pack a powerful audio feature",
    "article_text": "Rumors say Sony is expanding its range of video-focused Cinema Line cameras with a well-equipped premium prosumer model When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Last week we reported on a rumor claimingSonywould belaunching a new camera on May 28. We may now know what that camera is: a premium, full-frame video-centric mirrorless model called the Sony FX2 – and it might be coming with advanced cinema-focused features like 32-bit float audio recording. Of course, this all comes courtesy of another unconfirmed rumor, albeit from the relatively reliableCanon Rumorsnews site. Still, please take everything below as speculation rather than fact; until we hear the official word from Sony, nothing is definite. With that said,CanonRumors’ story is packed with interesting information. Firstly, it states that the FX2 will have a large tilting electronic viewfinder (EVF), which ties in with last week’s claim from Sony Alpha Rumors. It also says that the camera will use the same 33MP BSI full-frame sensor as found on Sony’s existingA7 IVandA7C IImodels. Other potential Sony FX2 specifications and features include a dedicated AI chip, AI-assisted autofocus, a mechanical shutter (by no means a given in a video-focused camera these days), an active cooling system to reduce overheating issues, 32-bit float audio – which would be a first for Sony, albeit present in recent Lumix cameras like thePanasonic Lumix GH7– and a4K60fps Super 35 video recording mode. The story also says the FX2 will feature the same physical connectivity and storage options as the currentSony FX3model (which means it’ll have XLR audio inputs as well as two CFexpress Type A/ SD card slots). As for the price, Canon Rumors states that the FX2 will cost $3,500 (around £2,670 or AU$5,430 if directly converted), putting this camera very much in premium territory in the Sony FX line-up, which also includes the FX3, FX30 and FX6. There's some confusion among Sony fans, though, surrounding the 33MP sensor being touted for the FX2. It is a high resolution sensor typically associated with Sony's hybrid cameras and not its video focused FX models like the FX3, which typically feature less pixels for better low light performance and handling of rolling shutter distortion. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. That sensor feels like a strange choice for Sony's FX Cinema Line but, again, the aformentioned features are based purely on rumors and could be inaccurate. Stay tuned for more news on Sony’s upcoming camera launch, which multiple sources have said will be happening on May 28 2025.

    "article_text": "A US Senator has slammed Meta's gas-powered datacenter plans When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Meta's plans to build a four-million-square-foot AI datacenter have come and fire over the potential greenhouse gas emission implications relating to its power source. The company's $10 billion site in Richland Parish, Louisiana, could require up to 2,300MW of energy coming from three new gas-fired power plants. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse sent a letter,published online, to the company's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, demanding transparency about energy use and emissions. Whitehouse criticized for social media giant's strategy as being contradictory to its own climate pledges, which revolve around meeting net zero emissions by the end of the decade. The Senator specifically questioned the lack of details on Meta's carbon capture contributions and renewable energy offsets. \"I am concerned by reports that Meta plans to power a data center in northeastern Louisiana with new and unabated natural gas generation,\" Whitehouse wrote. \"Neither Entergy nor Meta have disclosed details about the carbon capture project or the amount of Meta’s financial contribution, raising doubt as to whether Meta is meaningfully offsetting its emissions.\" The Senator demanded five separate pieces of information from the company, noting a deadline of May 28, 2025: detailed energy consumption and emission estimates for the datacenter; justification for choosing gas over other energy sources such as renewables, nuclear or geothermal; financial details and the impact of Meta's carbon capture investments; an explanation for not installing carbon capture at the new plants; and data showing how these actions align with the 2030 net zero goal. A Meta spokesperson toldThe Verge: \"We believe a diverse set of energy solutions are necessary to power our AI ambitions – and we continue to explore innovative technology solutions.\"TechRadar Prohas asked the company for a response.

    "title": "The Marvel multiverse saga isn't over yet, but these X-Men movie casting rumors are already making me rage like Wolverine",
    "article_text": "To me, my X-Men! When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Marvel's X-Men movie reboot is still a few years away. But, after numerous rumors appeared online last week (May 16-21) linking various big-name actors with roles in said film, the latest round of silly season casting is absolutely upon us. The comic giant's iconic mutants are set to play some part in the Multiverse Saga's next twoAvengersmovies. Indeed, with legacy characters including Patrick Stewart's Professor X and Ian McKellen's Magneto amongAvengers: Doomsday's initial 27-strong cast, actors who appeared in 20th Century Fox's now-defunctX-Menfranchise will return for one last hurrah before they pass the torch onto the next generation. Despite the fact thatAvengers: Doomsdayand its sequelAvengers: Secret Warswon't land in theaters until May 2026 and May 2027, Marvel is already scouring the globe (according to industry insiders, anyway) for A-listers to portray the X-Men in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Now, before we dig into these rumors, I should point out that it's not the actors who've been linked with each role that have irked me. They're all incredibly talented individuals, so I've no problem with any of them. My gripe relates to the fact that the next X-Men film is still years away, yet this is just the start of what I expect to be hundreds of stars reportedly tapped to appear as part of the mutant ensemble. But back to the rumors in hand. The first – and certainly the most eyebrow-raising – piece of gossip that's appeared online comes from prominent leakerMyTimeToShineHello(MTTSH). According to the industry insider, whose recent track record can be described as 'mixed' at best, none other than Daniel Day-Lewis was being eyed to succeed McKellen and fellow Magneto actor Michael Fassbender as the metal-manipulating mutant.As big a coup as it would be for Marvel to persuade Day-Lewis to join the MCU, this particular piece of speculation feels like unlikely, to say the least. The award-winning actor announced his retirement from acting over seven years ago and, apart from appearing inAnemone, an upcoming drama directed by his son Ronan, Day-Lewis hasn't starred in another big- or small-screen project since 2017'sPhantom Thread. It seems improbable, then, that he'd be coaxed out of retirement in what would likely to be a multi-picture MCU deal. Day-Lewis isn't the only fan-favorite actor who's been linked with a significant role as part of the MCU's new X-Men line-up. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Bryan Cranston – yes, he ofBreaking BadandMalcolm in the Middlefame, to name just two of his most notable roles – is said to be in the running to potentially star opposite Day-Lewis as the MCU's Charles Xavier. Again, this seems like an unusual fit for an actor whose best roles have seen him embody morally complex characters. In that sense, playing an X-Men adjacent individual/antagonist, such as Mister Sinister – a role Cranston has previously spoken about wanting to tackle (perDigital Spy) a decade ago – would be a better fit. Then there's speculation about who'll play Ororo Munroe, otherwise known as the iconic weather-manipulating mutant called Storm. PerMainMiddleMan, Marvel has approached Kirby Howell-Baptiste (The Sandman) and Jodie Turner-Smith (Star Wars: The Acolyte) to play her. Now, it would be remiss of me not to say that all of the above should be taken with a massive pinch of salt. For one, another industry leaker –Apocalyptic Horseman– has said they haven't even heard that a cast shortlist has been drawn up by Marvel. Regardless of how accurate Apocalyptic Horseman's sources may be, remember the unrelenting rumor mill about who'd playThe Fantastic Four, aka Marvel's First Family, inThe Fantastic Four: First Stepsand beyond in the MCU? Everyone from Adam Driver and Penn Badgley with linked with playing Reed Richards, while the likes of Margot Robbie and Jodie Comer were supposedly tapped to portray Sue Storm. In the end, such hearsay proved to be nothing more than idle gossip. So, just because Day-Lewis and company have been tentatively linked with roles in the MCU, it doesn't mean they'll actually sign on to appear in films once the Multiverse Saga ends at some point during or afterMarvel Phase 6. If Marvel is aiming for a middle ground between the elder acting statespeople who appeared in the first X-Men trilogy and their younger counterparts who starred in Fox's own X-Men reboot, Howell-Baptiste or Turner-Smith would be good fits for a mid-30s Munroe. Where Cranston and Day-Lewis are concerned, though, I'd be amazed if they ink deals to play Professor X and Magneto. We'll have to wait and see if any of these rumors have substance to them. The one thing that's absolutely certain, though, is these won't be the last X-Men casting rumors we read about. It's going to be a long and at times frustrating period of speculation, so strap in for plenty more outlandish rumors in the weeks, months, and even years to come, everyone.

    "article_text": "Danish drama has viewers gripped When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Netflix latest thriller is a binge-worthy treat that has got viewers talking and critics raving. The show in question, Danish dramaSecrets We Keep– orReservatetin its native tongue – has rocketed up the Netflix charts since its release on May 15 and is currently third in the streamer’s top 10, making it well on its way to becoming one of thebest Netflix shows. But it's not just audiences who can’t get enough of the new thriller, with critics giving it such strong reviews that it's sitting at a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Drawing favorable comparisons to the platform’s numerous Harlan Coben adaptations,Secrets We Keepfollows thefalloutof the disappearance of a young au pair in an affluent Copenhagen suburb. Suspecting her neighbours of foul play, business exec and mother Cecile (Marie Bach Hansen) undertakes her own investigation, soon discovering that numerous members of her upper-class friend group may have had a part to play in the events. Proving that themes around class and social norms are global concepts,Secrets We Keepdelves into societal divides and the, well, secrets that bubble just below the surface of the seemingly perfect lives of the wealthy suburban set. The show also draws on similar themes as recentNetflix sensationAdolescenceas it touches on internet-fueled misogyny and the 'manosphere' culture among teenage boys. While not as harrowing as Stephen Graham’s show,Secrets We Keep– which you can watch the trailer for below – is a gripping binge-watch, particularly for fans of Coben’s brand of suburban darkness. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. With the show currently enjoying a perfect score over on Rotten Tomatoes, it's safe to say critics are loving Netflix’s Danish drama, withour friends over onTom’s Guidecalling it “one of the best binge-watches of 2025 so far.” Collider’s review compares the thriller to two of the biggest shows of the year, even excelling them in some areas, saying: “Secrets We Keepexplores similar thematic territory to this year's most zeitgeisty hitsAdolescenceandThe White Lotus, and in some ways handles its dark material even better,” while critic Pramit Chatterjee calls it “essential viewing for all.” Viewers, however, aren’t quite as universal in their praise, with RT’s Audience Score sitting at a respectable but unremarkable 76%. One Reddit user criticised the show’s relatively short runtime, saying “This series felt like it needed 2-3 more episodes to flesh out the characters and storyline a little more” while another found the story predictable, saying “I had the whole plot pretty much figured out by the second episode.” A third user didn’t pull any punches with their verdict: “This show is bad, like so bad.” However, others have praised the drama as “thought provoking” and “nuanced”, with one user saying they “binged it and loved it,” while another commented: “I have just watched the whole season, it was very good.” WithSecrets We Keeplooking like the next must watch Netflix show, you can head over to one of thebest streaming servicesand add the Danish drama to your watchlist right now.

    "title": "US should never have intervened in Ukraine – Trump",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump has blamed his predecessor Joe Biden for funneling vast amounts of American taxpayer money into a foreign conflict that“should have remained a European situation.” Speaking to reporters at the White House following a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday, Trump expressed frustration over the“crazy”scale of US involvement in the Ukraine conflict. He reiterated that it was“not our war”and emphasized that his administration is working to end the hostilities through diplomacy. “This is not our war. This is not my war… I mean, we got ourselves entangled in something that we shouldn’t have been involved in. And we would have been a lot better off – and maybe the whole thing would have been better off – because it can’t be much worse. It’s a real mess,”Trump said. The president stated that Washington has provided“massive”and“record-setting”levels of military and financial assistance to Kiev – far exceeding what the EU and other NATO countries have contributed. “We don’t have boots on the ground, we wouldn’t have boots on the ground. But we do have a big stake. The financial amount that was put up is just crazy,”he added. “Again, this was a European situation. It should have remained a European situation. But we got involved – much more than Europe did – because the past administration felt very strongly that we should,\"he said.\"We gave massive amounts, I think record-setting amounts, both weaponry and money.” Trump’s conversation with Putin was followed by calls with several European leaders, including the heads of Germany, Italy, and the UK, as well as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky.“They have a big problem. It’s a terrible war. The amount of anger, the amount of hate, the amount of death,”Trump said, noting that the conflict has reached a point where“it’s very hard to extradite themselves away from what’s taken place over there.” Trump said he believes both Putin and Zelensky want peace, but only time will tell if it can be achieved. “There’s a good chance we can get this done. I believe Putin wants to do it… My whole life is like deals, one big deal. And if I thought that President Putin did not want to get this over with, I wouldn’t even be talking about it because I’d just pull out.” Pressed by reporters on whether he had a“red line”that would cause him to walk away from mediating the conflict or potentially escalate US involvement, Trump declined to elaborate.“Yeah, I would say I do have a certain line, but I don’t want to say what that line is because I think it makes the negotiation even more difficult than it is,”he said. Putin described the conversation with Trump as“frank”and“quite useful,”adding that Moscow is prepared to work with Kiev on drafting a memorandum aimed at achieving a future peace agreement. “In general, Russia’s position is clear. The main thing for us is to eliminate the root causes of this crisis,”the Russian president said.",

    "title": "China to launch world’s first drone ‘mother ship’ (VIDEO)",
    "article_text": "China is preparing to launch what it says is the world’s first“drone carrier”aircraft, capable of releasing swarms of AI-guided kamikaze drones during high-altitude missions. The Jiu Tian, or ‘High Sky’ UAV, is scheduled to complete its first test mission by the end of June, according to the state broadcaster CCTV. The aircraft is said to have a maximum takeoff weight of 16 tonnes and a wingspan of 25 meters. It can reportedly cruise at altitudes up to 15,000 meters (50,000 feet) – higher than most common medium-range air defense systems – and has a range of approximately 7,000 kilometers (4,350 miles). The jet-powered Jiu Tian is reportedly capable of carrying up to 6 tonnes of ammunition with the ability to release up to 100 units of loitering munitions or small drones, including kamikaze UAVs, from two launch bays located on either side of the fuselage. After the aircraft completes a series of test missions, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) plans to deploy it as a“drone mother ship”UAV, which will make it possible to extend the operational radius of attack drones and boost their swarming capabilities. It will also be possible to use it in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assignments, as well as electronic warfare. China’s first aerial mothership, Jiutian SS-UAV, is scheduled for its maiden flight in June. It can cruise at 15,000m high carrying over 100 small drones or 1,000 kg of missiles, with a range of 7,000km. Don’t worry, China’s military is peace-oriented from the start. We grow…pic.twitter.com/koCXA4uq6g Outside of military applications, the drone carrier could be employed for emergency logistics, border patrol, search and rescue missions, and natural disaster response. The plane, which was first unveiled at China’s Zhuhai air show in November, has been designed by the state-owned aerospace giant Aviation Industry Corporation of China and built by Xian Chida Aircraft Parts Manufacturing. As noted by the Economic Times, the Jiu Tian largely mirrors the capabilities of Western UAV systems like the MQ-9 Reaper and the RQ-4 Global Hawk, while adding swarm-launch functionality, which has yet to be introduced in the US arsenal.",

    "title": "Biden’s cancer cover-up: A medical screw-up or a calculated sob story?",
    "article_text": "Former US President Joe Biden has revealed a devastating medical diagnosis: an aggressive, metastatic form of prostate cancer. While the diagnosis itself calls for sympathy, the timing of its demands scrutiny. We are told that Biden’s cancer, discovered following a recent medical exam, has already spread to his bones – a sign of a disease not just aggressive, but advanced. And yet this is the same man who, as we had been constantly reassured during his presidency, was under the most sophisticated and regular medical scrutiny in the world. For someone whose health is of profound national interest, especially given his age, this level of late-stage detection is implausible. If Biden were an average citizen in a broken healthcare system, such a delay might be tragically understandable. But he is not. He is the former commander-in-chief of a global superpower. His check-ups were comprehensive, frequent, and confidential. Which begs the obvious, unsettling question: Did they already know – and simply not tell us? The diagnosis announcement lands with eerie precision, just days ahead of the publication ofOriginal Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again, an upcoming book by journalists Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson. The book promises an unflinching account of the inner workings of an administration allegedly defined by obfuscation and denial about the president’s mental and physical decline. The timing is not a coincidence – it is a strategy. By announcing Biden’s cancer now, his PR team appears to be preemptively rewriting the narrative. WhenOriginal Sinraises serious concerns about the former president’s capacity to serve, the public will already be primed to respond not with alarm or anger, but with compassion for a 'sick old man'facing mortality with dignity. In other words: Damage control, not transparency. This is not the first time Biden’s health has been shrouded in mystery. For years, his evident frailty has sparked debates – not just among partisan pundits, but across dinner tables and newsroom panels. Conservative commentators have long floated the idea that what we’re witnessing is less“elder statesmanship”and more a form of elderly exploitation – propping up a figurehead while obscuring the reality behind the curtain. The jokes about“elder abuse”began as punchlines but are now starting to look like blunt assessments of a harsh truth. The president's health isn’t just a personal matter; it’s a national security concern. And if Biden's cancer was indeed known or suspected months – or years – ago, when he was still in office, the cover-up is not only cynical but deeply irresponsible. This late-stage disclosure isn’t just about health; it’s about trust. The American people deserve honesty from their leaders, particularly when those leaders ask for our votes while hiding the most consequential truths. The calculated timing of this announcement – designed to dilute the blow of an upcoming exposé – is political cynicism at its worst. Biden’s diagnosis may elicit sympathy, but it should not elicit forgiveness for deception. The truth appears to have been suppressed until it was strategically useful. And that should outrage every American, regardless of party. The story here isn’t just about cancer. It’s about a presidency that may have allowed disease to metastasize not just in the body of its leader, but in the moral fabric of its governance.",

    "title": "Negotiations between Russia and Ukraine will begin ‘immediately’ – Trump on Putin call",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has said the conversation with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin“went very well,”and that talks between Moscow and Kiev will begin“immediately.” The two leaders spoke for over two hours on Monday, primarily about the Ukraine conflict. Putin also described the talk as“very useful.” In a post on Truth Social shortly after Monday’s talks, Trump wrote that the tone and spirit of the conversation were“excellent,”adding,“If it wasn’t, I would say so now, rather than later.” “Russia and Ukraine will immediately start negotiations toward a Ceasefire and, more importantly, an END to the War. The conditions for that will be negotiated between the two parties, as it can only be, because they know details of a negotiation that nobody else would be aware of,”the US president stated. Russia“wants to do large-scale TRADE”with the US, Trump has claimed, adding that the potential settlement of the conflict would help Ukraine to become“a great beneficiary”of trade as well. “There is a tremendous opportunity for Russia to create massive amounts of jobs and wealth. Its potential is UNLIMITED,”Trump wrote. The US president also said that“immediately after the call”with Putin, he spoke with Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, and Finnish President Alexander Stubb, informing them about his conversation with his Russian counterpart. \"Let the process begin!\"Trump wrote. Monday’s phone call, initially announced by Trump on Saturday, was described by Putin as“frank”and“quite useful.” According to a statement issued by the Kremlin following the call, the Russian president said that he thanked Trump for“US support in resuming direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine.” Putin said Moscow is ready to work with Kiev on a memorandum that envisions a future peace agreement between the two countries. “In general, Russia’s position is clear. The main thing for us is to eliminate the root causes of this crisis,”Putin stated.",

    "title": "Baltic country accuses Russia of detaining oil tanker",
    "article_text": "Estonian authorities have accused Russia of detaining a tanker carrying shale oil from the Baltic country. The incident reportedly took place not long after Tallinn attempted to inspect a vessel sailing from Russia. Western nations imposed maritime restrictions on Russia and an oil price cap on the country's crude exports, following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022. They have since accused Russia of circumventing the restrictions by using a so-called 'shadow fleet' of tankers, which operate outside Western insurance systems. In a statement on Sunday, Estonia’s Foreign Ministry claimed that earlier in the day,“the Russian Federation detained the oil tanker Green Admire, sailing under the Liberian flag and owned by a Greek company, as it was departing from the Estonian Port of Sillamae and following a previously agreed route through Russian territorial waters.” According to officials in Tallinn, the vessel entered Russian waters under a trilateral agreement between Moscow, Tallinn and Helsinki, to avoid shallows. Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna stated that“this is definitely connected to the fact that we have started to harass Russia’s shadow fleet.” Tsahkna revealed that last week Estonian authorities attempted to“inspect”an unflagged and uninsured vessel, which was passing through its exclusive economic zone, under suspicion that it has been sanctioned by the UK and belongs to Russia’s ‘shadow fleet.’ A Russian fighter jet briefly violated Estonian airspace while accompanying the tanker, he added. Nikolay Patrushev, a senior aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin, last month said that the EU and the UK were mulling further restrictions to disrupt Moscow’s shipping activities that“increasingly resemble a maritime blockade.” The official, who chairs Russia’s Maritime Board, warned the“hotheads in London or Brussels”that Moscow would not hesitate to deploy its Navy to ensure the security of Russian shipping, should diplomatic or legal instruments prove ineffective. In recent months, NATO has increased its military presence in the Baltic Sea after claiming that Russia had intentionally damaged undersea cables in the region.",

    "title": "Are US-Israel ‘special relations’ about to end?",
    "article_text": "Last week, US President Donald Trump embarked on his first official overseas tour since taking office, choosing to visit three key Gulf nations – Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. This itinerary was both unexpected and, in many ways, unprecedented. Unlike his predecessors, who traditionally began their foreign policy engagements with visits to long-standing Western allies, Trump opted to prioritize America’s Arab partners, deliberately bypassing Israel – Washington’s principal strategic ally in the region. This marked the first time in decades that a sitting US president visiting the Middle East consciously excluded it from the agenda. This decision signaled a potential recalibration of Washington’s priorities in the region. Relations between the Trump administration and the Israeli leadership, particularly Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, were already strained in the early stages – largely due to Israel’s growing intransigence on the Palestinian question and the increasing influence of far-right factions within the Israeli government. Faced with mounting frustration over Israel’s hardline policies, the White House appeared to pivot toward a more pragmatic, less confrontational, and economically advantageous partnership with the Gulf monarchies. However, the rationale behind this shift extended beyond political calculation. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar have long played a pivotal role in sustaining American influence in the Middle East – not only because of their strategic geography but also due to their substantial investments in the US economy and multi-billion-dollar arms contracts. For a business-minded president eager to showcase the profitability of foreign policy through economic deals, these nations represented ideal counterparts. The lavish receptions afforded to Trump during his Gulf tour might have been dismissed as mere pageantry were it not for their deeper symbolic resonance. The true significance of the visit lay in what it revealed about broader geopolitical currents: namely, the transformation of the Gulf monarchies from regional players into increasingly assertive global actors. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar are no longer content with being perceived as passive participants in American-led regional frameworks. Instead, they are positioning themselves as independent centers of power in an emerging multipolar world order. Their growing international stature stems from several interrelated factors. First, these countries have embraced ambitious and forward-looking development strategies, investing heavily in infrastructure, clean energy transitions, technological innovation, and global finance. No longer simply hydrocarbon exporters, they are becoming hubs of digital transformation, international logistics, Islamic finance, and global policy discourse on issues ranging from security to sustainable development. Second, the Gulf states have pioneered a distinctive model of governance that blends traditionalism with modernization. While maintaining deep-rooted commitments to Islamic and tribal values, they have achieved remarkable progress in building diversified and globally competitive economies. This synthesis has not only enabled them to thrive amid intensifying global competition but, in some respects, to outpace certain Western nations grappling with internal divisions and economic stagnation. Equally noteworthy is the political resilience of these monarchies. Western narratives often portray them simplistically as 'absolute monarchies,' failing to appreciate the internal mechanisms of governance that underpin their stability. In reality, the political architecture of the Gulf is more accurately described as 'sheikhism' – a system rooted in consensus among tribal and familial elites, structured around a balance of obligations, reciprocal loyalties, and ongoing consultation. This model, which integrates Islamic principles such asshura(consultation) with practical statecraft, has proven remarkably adaptive and resilient. In this context, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar can no longer be viewed merely as privileged US allies or energy suppliers. They are emerging as autonomous actors in global politics – capable of forging regional alliances, shaping international agendas across energy, media, and technology, and mediating in global conflicts. Their evolving role reflects not dependence on external security guarantees, but the outcome of deliberate, long-term strategies to consolidate sovereignty, enhance prestige, and assert influence in the 21st century. President Donald Trump’s visit to the Gulf states was far more than his first foreign trip as head of state. It was a bold, highly symbolic debut of a new US foreign economic doctrine rooted in pragmatism, transactionalism, and strategic capitalism. Unlike previous administrations, which typically foregrounded diplomacy, security alliances, and value-based partnerships, Trump approached this tour as a high-stakes business deal. His mindset was that of a dealmaker, not a traditional statesman. The objective was clear: to restore America’s economic dominance by leveraging the vast wealth and strategic ambitions of the Middle East’s richest monarchies. Trump’s campaign slogan,“Make America Great Again,”found tangible expression in this tour. His mission was to bring back jobs, reindustrialize key sectors, boost the US high-tech ecosystem, and enhance national competitiveness – all fueled by a surge in foreign direct investment. In this pursuit, the oil-rich, capital-heavy Gulf monarchies – endowed with massive sovereign wealth funds and seeking greater global visibility – emerged as ideal partners. In Saudi Arabia, Trump signed an unprecedented economic package worth over $600 billion, including the largest arms deal in US history – $142 billion covering missile defense systems, advanced aviation platforms, cybersecurity capabilities, and military-grade AI technologies. Equally significant was the launch of a new tech alliance: Saudi-based DataVolt committed $20 billion to build data centers and energy facilities in the US, while a consortium led by Nvidia, AMD, and Amazon Web Services will co-develop an AI innovation hub within the Kingdom. A $50 billion venture fund was also established to support US-based startups in renewable energy and cybersecurity. In Qatar, the results were even more staggering: agreements totaling $1.2 trillion, the largest single-country deal package in US diplomatic history. Central to this was Qatar Airways’ order for 210 Boeing aircraft valued at $96 billion, making it the most lucrative deal ever for the American aerospace giant. Qatar also pledged tens of billions of dollars for joint ventures in quantum computing, smart energy networks, and STEM education programs for engineers and IT specialists in the US. In a provocative symbolic gesture, Qatar proposed gifting President Trump a custom-built Air Force One, sparking intense debate in the American media landscape. In the United Arab Emirates, new agreements totaling $200 billion were signed – in addition to a previously negotiated $1.4 trillion package. Key components included the construction of an aluminum plant in Oklahoma, expansion of oil and gas infrastructure with US firms, and a landmark $100 billion commitment to American companies specializing in artificial intelligence over the next three years. In total, Trump’s Gulf tour yielded over $2 trillion in contracts and investment pledges – an economic windfall of historic proportions. But beyond the numbers, the trip marked a fundamental redefinition of American foreign policy: from projecting power through military force and ideological alignment, to securing influence through economic penetration and transactional partnerships. Trump unveiled a new image of the US – not as a global policeman, but as a global entrepreneur. A nation that negotiates not with declarations, but with data, contracts, and employment metrics. This new model resonated deeply with the Gulf monarchies themselves, which are undergoing profound transformations. Once reliant solely on oil exports, these states are rapidly evolving into tech-driven economies with ambitions to become global hubs of innovation, finance, and logistics. In Trump’s America, they found not just a security guarantor, but a strategic co-architect of a post-oil economic order – one where capital, innovation, and mutual profit outweigh traditional diplomatic protocol and ideological rhetoric. Trump’s message was unambiguous: the era of foreign policy as charity is over. What now matters are mutual returns, strategic alignments, and economic gains. The Gulf states, driven by their own visions of modernization and diversification, eagerly embraced this shift. Together, they reimagined international relations not as a sphere of obligations, but as a marketplace of opportunities. One of the most significant – albeit unofficial – outcomes of Donald Trump’s Middle East tour could be discerned even before the journey began: the US President conspicuously bypassed Israel. This omission became all the more striking given that even Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who had initially planned a visit to Tel Aviv, abruptly cancelled his trip at the last moment. The message did not go unnoticed in either Washington or Jerusalem: nearly all observers interpreted the move as a clear sign of a cooling relationship between the US and Israel – more precisely, between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The rift between the two leaders appears less personal than strategic, rooted in diverging visions of the region’s future. Tensions had been mounting for months. The first major flashpoint came when Trump unilaterally announced the withdrawal of American forces from operations against Yemen’s Houthi rebels, citing the group’s supposed commitment to halt attacks on Red Sea shipping lanes. The decision, made without prior consultation with Israel – which continues to endure daily rocket fire from the Houthis – dealt a blow not only to diplomatic norms but also to the foundational trust between Israel and its closest ally. An even more sensitive issue has been the quiet resumption of US contacts with Iran. With Oman acting as mediator, Washington has been exploring the outlines of a possible new nuclear agreement. Meanwhile, Israel remains steadfast in its conviction that no negotiations with Tehran should occur until decisive military action is taken against its nuclear and military facilities – a show of force intended to compel concessions. Netanyahu failed to persuade Trump of this hardline approach, and the US president has increasingly charted his own, more flexible course. Tensions have also sharpened over the future of Syria. Israel refuses to recognize the country’s new leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, branding him a former al-Qaeda affiliate and a dangerous actor. Israeli airstrikes on Syrian territory continue, the buffer zone in the Golan Heights remains under Israeli control, and the Druze population has formally been placed under Israeli protection. While Israel promotes the vision of a weak, decentralized Syria, Washington is embracing the opposite: al-Sharaa was invited to meet with Trump in Saudi Arabia, and following those talks, the US signaled its intent to lift sanctions on Damascus. Even more striking was the revelation that Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE – previously restrained by US pressure – are now prepared to invest in Syria’s reconstruction, viewing it as both a stabilizing opportunity and a chance to expand their regional influence. Israeli frustration has been further stoked by Washington’s evolving stance on the Palestinian issue. Despite Israel’s ongoing military operation in Gaza, Trump has increasingly expressed a desire – even a demand – for a resolution to the conflict. His Gaza reconstruction plan, unveiled in February, sent shockwaves through Washington: it proposed the complete depopulation of Palestinians from the enclave and the transformation of the territory into a luxury international resort zone under US control. Not only was this radical proposal never coordinated with Israel, but it also raised fundamental questions about the future of the US-Israel alliance. To make matters more complex, credible reports have emerged that the US has been engaged in direct negotiations with Hamas, without informing Israel. The recent release of an American citizen, IDF soldier Idan Alexander, who was captured in October 2023, was reportedly achieved through these covert channels – of which the Israeli government only became aware through its own intelligence services. Against this backdrop, speculation is growing that the White House is seriously considering formally recognizing an independent Palestinian state. Such a move would not be a mere diplomatic gesture – it would reshape the strategic architecture of the Middle East. Should Washington proceed down this path, Israel could find itself in strategic isolation, while the center of regional gravity shifts toward Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, and Türkiye – countries with which Trump is building pragmatic, mutually beneficial, and business-driven relations. None of these states demand unconditional support from Washington, meddle in its internal politics, or leverage domestic crises for influence. More importantly, they offer Trump what he values most: investment, trade, strategic partnership based on reciprocal interest, and freedom from ideological constraints. Thus, a new geopolitical reality is taking shape before our eyes. In this emerging landscape, Donald Trump appears less inclined to view Israel as an indispensable ally and more drawn to politically agile, economically potent, and regionally assertive actors across the Arab world – and Türkiye. If rumors of Palestinian state recognition prove true, it will mark the end of the long-standing era of“special relations”between the US and Israel and signal the dawn of a new chapter in American Middle East policy – one governed not by ideological loyalty, but by unambiguous political and economic rationality.",

    "article_text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has hailed his phone call with his US counterpart Donald Trump as“very useful.”The two leaders spoke for over two hours on Monday, primarily about the Ukraine conflict. Speaking to reporters shortly after the call, Putin thanked the US president for supporting the resumption of direct negotiations between Moscow and Kiev on a potential peace agreement. He said Trump had outlined his position on ending hostilities and the possibility of a ceasefire during the conversation. “For our part, I also emphasized that Russia supports a peaceful resolution of the Ukraine conflict,”Putin said, adding“We must simply identify the most effective path toward peace.” Moscow is ready to work with Kiev on a memorandum that envisions a future peace agreement between the two countries, Putin has said. “We’ve agreed with the US president that Russia will propose and be ready to work with the Ukrainian side on a memorandum on a potential future peace agreement, defining such positions as the principles of the settlement and the timeframe for a potential conclusion of the peace agreement, including [the announcement of] a possible ceasefire for a certain period of time,”the president stated. The recent resumption of direct talks with Kiev shows that the situation is generally steering“in the right direction,”Putin has said.“The issue is, of course, that both Moscow and Kiev should demonstrate maximum desire for peace and find compromises that would satisfy all parties,”he added. Last week in Istanbul, Russian and Ukrainian representatives held their first direct talks since 2022, when Kiev backed out of a proposed peace deal that had been agreed in principle by both sides. The latest round of negotiations has led to a proposal for the largest prisoner exchange between the two countries and a pledge to continue dialogue. Putin reiterated that Russia’s position is to negotiate a long-term resolution of the conflict that addresses the“root causes.”",

    "title": "Israel to ‘take over all of Gaza’ – Netanyahu",
    "article_text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has announced plans to seize control of Gaza as part of a“massive”military operation against Hamas. Intensified airstrikes have reportedly left hundreds dead in the Palestinian enclave in the past several days. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Sunday began a major ground offensive, dubbed ‘Gideon's Chariots’, advancing into both the northern and southern areas of Gaza. Israel says the operation is focused on defeating Hamas and securing the release of the remaining hostages. In a video posted on Monday on Netanyahu’s Telegram channel, the prime minister addressed criticism of the months-long humanitarian aid blockade, which has left Gaza on the brink of famine. Netanyahu defended the measure, arguing that the Palestinian militant group has been diverting aid for its own use. He said a new mechanism had been introduced to distribute food and medicine through designated points under Israeli control. According to Netanyahu, the“war and victory”plan includes“tremendous military pressure, our massive entry to actually take over all of Gaza,”as well as efforts to“cut off Hamas from any ability to exploit humanitarian aid.” On Sunday, Netanyahu’s office said Israel would ease the blockade to allow limited food shipments into Gaza. The new distribution system would take time to set up, the prime minister said, adding that“we are going to establish the first points in a few more days and add more later.” International aid groups have repeatedly warned in recent weeks of the risk of famine in Gaza as Israeli bombardment intensified. Over 300 people, including children, had been killed in the 72 hours to early Monday, Palestinian health officials said. Israel blames the civilian casualties on Hamas, citing the group’s use of densely populated areas for military operations. Hamas said on Monday the IDF was firing“hundreds of highly destructive shells, missiles, and bombs daily”at residential neighborhoods. The IDF said it had struck 160“terror targets”in the past 24 hours. Netanyahu has vowed the war will continue until Hamas is defeated. The militant group has rejected calls to disarm. Israel says it has stepped up its offensive to pressure Hamas to release the remaining hostages taken during the militant group’s October 2023 attack, in which 1,200 people were killed and around 250 abducted. An estimated 58 hostages remain in Gaza. The ensuing war in the enclave has killed more than 53,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, according to local health officials.",

    "title": "US unveils revised Gaza truce proposal – Axios",
    "article_text": "White House envoy Steve Witkoff has presented Israel and Hamas with a new ceasefire proposal, Axios has reported, with Washington urging both sides to accept the deal. The push coincides with the Jewish state’s renewed assault on Gaza, which included a wave of weekend airstrikes and a major ground offensive – Operation Gideon’s Chariots. According to Axios, Witkoff’s proposal includes a 45- to 60-day ceasefire in exchange for the release of ten hostages and Palestinian prisoners. While similar to past plans, the latest version reportedly contains clearer language signaling that it could lead to a permanent ceasefire. It also includes guarantees aimed at preventing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from unilaterally ending the truce – an issue that derailed a previous agreement. Sources say Netanyahu has responded positively but with many conditions. Hamas has not yet agreed and is reportedly seeking firm assurances that a temporary truce could pave the way for a lasting ceasefire. Negotiation teams from both sides are formally in Qatar, but an Israeli official told Axios that the real discussions are happening through other, less public channels. Talks mediated by Qatar, Egypt, and the US have so far failed to produce a breakthrough. Netanyahu maintains that the war will not end without Hamas’ total defeat, while the group continues to reject disarmament terms. The current escalation began in October 2023, when Hamas launched a surprise cross-border attack on Israel, killing around 1,200 people and abducting 250. An estimated 58 hostages remain in Gaza, including both living captives and those confirmed deceased whose remains have not yet been recovered. As of Monday, the Palestinian death toll from Israel’s offensive in Gaza has surpassed 53,400, according to the enclave’s health officials.",

    "title": "NATO state pledges $600 million to Ukraine",
    "article_text": "Denmark has announced a new military aid package worth $618 million for Ukraine, focusing on artillery munitions. The assistance comes as the US continues its efforts to achieve a settlement between Moscow and Kiev, which recently held their first direct talks in three years. In a statement on Saturday, the Danish Defense Ministry said the assistance includes funding for artillery systems, ammunition, and equipment for Ukraine's air force. The support – worth 4.2 billion Danish kroner – covers the period up to 2028. It is being financed within the framework for military support under the EU’s Ukraine Fund, and is reimbursed through the bloc’s European Peace Facility. A significant portion of the Danish aid has been allocated to the Czech Ammunition Initiative established in 2024 by Denmark, the Czech Republic, and the Netherlands to finance the purchase of as many as 800,000 large-caliber shells for Ukraine. The program, however, has faced criticism. An investigation by the US state-funded funded RFE/RL broadcaster and several other outlets revealed that Czech companies involved in procuring artillery shells for Ukraine charged commissions up to four times higher than Ukrainian state agencies. Additionally, some deliveries arrived later than scheduled, potentially impacting Ukraine’s defense planning. In some cases, there have also been complaints of poor quality munitions. Ukraine has long complained about the lack of ammunition and Russian artillery superiority while imploring its Western backers to ramp up military deliveries, with European contractors often struggling to meet the soaring demand. The announcement comes as the US under President Donald Trump continues its efforts to mediate the conflict. Last week, Russia and Ukraine held a two-hour meeting in Istanbul, which was their first direct peace talks since 2022. As a result, the sides exchanged lists of conditions for a potential ceasefire, agreed to a large-scale prisoner exchange, and discussed the possibility of a follow-up round of talks. Russia has consistently condemned Western arms shipments to Ukraine, warning that they will only prolong the conflict without changing its outcome while becoming an additional economic burden for ordinary taxpayers.",

    "article_text": "France’s foreign intelligence service has denied claims that its director pressured Telegram founder Pavel Durov to censor political content on the messaging platform. Durov claimed on Sunday that the government of a Western European country – which he hinted was France – had asked him to block conservative Romanian content on Telegram ahead of the country’s presidential runoff. After Parisdeniedinvolvement, Durov identified Nicolas Lerner, head of the Directorate-General for External Security (DGSE), as the official behind the request. On Monday, the DGSE told French outlets Agence France-Presse and Le Monde that it had contacted Durov on multiple occasions, but only to“firmly remind him of his company’s responsibilities, and his own personally, in preventing terrorist and child pornography threats.”The agency rejected accusations of political interference. Durov was arrested in France last August after arriving at Le Bourget Airport and charged with complicity in crimes allegedly carried out by Telegram users, including extremism and child abuse offenses. He was released on €5 million ($5.46 million) bail. The Russian-born entrepreneur, whose company is headquartered in Dubai, left France with official permission in mid-March. The dispute emerged as Romania held its second attempt at a presidential election. On Sunday, pro-EU candidate Nicusor Dan narrowly defeated Euroskeptic rival George Simion in a runoff. A previous vote last year was annulled after right-wing independent Calin Georgescu unexpectedly won the first round. Romania’s Constitutional Court invalidated the initial vote, citing alleged Russian interference. Media reports linked Georgescu’s surge in support to a digital campaign orchestrated by a firm with ties to the ruling National Liberal Party, which may have aimed to split the conservative vote. Romania’s Foreign Ministry has also accused Moscow of meddling in the latest runoff. The Russian government has dismissed the claim.",

    "title": "US reiterates ‘red line’ in Iran nuclear talks",
    "article_text": "The US will not accept any nuclear deal with Iran that allows Tehran to continue uranium enrichment, Steve Witkoff, President Donald Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, has said. Iran has dismissed the demand as“unrealistic,”but said it is open to dialogue. In an interview with ABC News on Sunday, Witkoff stated that while the Trump administration wants to solve the stand-off with Iran diplomatically,“we have one very, very clear red line, and that is enrichment.” “We cannot allow even 1% of an enrichment capability,”he stressed.“Enrichment enables weaponization. And we will not allow a bomb to get here.” Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi fired back, dismissing the demand as“unrealistic”and saying Tehran would continue enriching uranium with or without a deal. He also suggested that the US is“completely detached from the reality of negotiations.” Araghchi added that Iran was willing to show that it is not seeking to build nuclear weapons.“If the US is interested in ensuring that Iran will not have nuclear weapons, a deal is within reach, and we are ready for a serious conversation to achieve a solution that will forever ensure that outcome,”the minister said. Iran currently enriches uranium to 60% purity, far above the 3.67% cap set under the now-defunct 2015 nuclear deal and close to the 90% needed for weapons-grade material. While US officials have on numerous occasions warned that Tehran is just weeks away from a nuclear breakthrough, Tehran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and not aimed at producing a bomb. Last week, the New York Times reported, citing sources, that Iran proposed the creation of a joint enrichment venture involving regional Arab states and American investment during recent indirect talks in Oman. A spokesman for Witkoff has denied the claim. The US unilaterally withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018, which had curbed Tehran’s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. At the time, Trump argued that the agreement was too weak to prevent Iran from eventually acquiring nuclear weapons. The US reimposed sanctions, prompting Tehran to gradually ramp up enrichment beyond agreed limits.",

    "title": "EU state to tap frozen Russian funds to send arms to Ukraine",
    "article_text": "Finland will supply heavy ammunition to Kiev using proceeds from Russian assets which were frozen over the Ukraine conflict, the Defense Ministry said on Monday. The move is part of a broader EU push to channel profits from immobilized Russian assets – which are primarily EU, US, and UK government bonds held in a Brussels-based securities depository – to fund Ukraine’s military. Moscow considers the seizure of its assets“theft.” Finland has struck a deal with the European Commission to send money through the European Peace Facility (EPF), the ministry said in a statement. Under the agreement, Finland will supply €90 million ($101 million) worth of heavy ammunition procured from domestic producers. The Finnish government said the deal will also benefit its defense industry. In March, Helsinki announced its 28th military aid package to Ukraine, worth around $225 million. Western countries froze an estimated $300 billion worth of Russian sovereign funds following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022. Around $213 billion of this is held by Euroclear. The frozen funds have already accrued billions in interest, of which Euroclear transferred $1.63 billion to Kiev last July. Russia has condemned the freezing of its assets, hinting at possible retaliatory measures against Western investments. Moscow has also warned against Western weapons deliveries to Ukraine, saying they only serve to prolong the conflict and heighten regional security threats. According to Kiel Institute estimates, Kiev received over $363 billion in NATO aid as of February 2025. A recent report by the Eurasia Observatory, which tracks the conflict’s long-term impact on organized crime, suggests that a massive influx of Western-supplied weapons from Ukraine will hit Europe’s black markets after the conflict with Russia is over. The report stated that weapons, including heavy arms, are being stockpiled across Ukraine, and that once the conflict ends and martial law is lifted, reduced state control could create opportunities for organized crime.",

    "title": "Trump could pass more sanctions on Russia – Bloomberg",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump is reportedly considering a new sanctions bill targeting Russia if it does not make progress in ceasefire talks with Ukraine, Bloomberg reported on Monday, citing European officials familiar with the matter. The legislation has been authored by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham – a longtime advocate of hardline policies against Moscow. The US imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia under former President Joe Biden following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022. Trump has since signaled a willingness to restore bilateral contacts and possibly even lift the sanctions as part of a negotiated peace. The Trump administration has said, however, that it would not pursue a peaceful resolution of the conflict indefinitely if no progress is made. According to Bloomberg, US officials have privately told their European counterparts that Trump may allow Graham’s bill to proceed if“Russia doesn’t budge,”and could deliver the warning to President Vladimir Putin during a scheduled call on Monday. Graham, a prominent Russia hawk, has in the past called for Putin’s assassination, backed extensive military aid to Kiev, and stated that Russians dying in the Ukraine conflict is“the best money we’ve ever spent.”He has also praised Ukraine for fighting what he described as a proxy war on behalf of the US. In April, he proposed a sanctions package that he said would be“devastating”for the Russian economy, including 500% tariffs on goods from countries that continue trading with Moscow. He claimed that the proposal has majority support in the Senate. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also confirmed the possibility of additional sanctions on Moscow in an interview with CBS on Sunday, saying he conveyed this to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov the day before, urging an immediate ceasefire. Russia has rejected calls for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire, saying that while it is open to the idea, it is concerned that Ukraine would exploit the pause to rearm and continue its mobilization efforts. Moscow has instead insisted on negotiating a long-term resolution of the conflict that addresses the root causes. The EU has also approved its 17th package of sanctions on Russia, attempting to use it as a means of pressuring the country into making concessions to Ukraine. The Kremlin has described the West’s“language of ultimatums”as unacceptable. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has warned that this rhetoric could result in“unsuccessful negotiations,”leading to a“more terrible stage of the war with new weapons and participants.”",

    "title": "China is sending an important signal to the entire world",
    "article_text": "Last week, China released its first-ever white paper on national security. While the document brings no major breakthroughs, its publication is significant. It signals two key developments: Chinese leaders are increasingly concerned about the intensifying geopolitical confrontation, and they are ready to play a more assertive role in global affairs – challenging US dominance in the process. The economy-first reform pattern that characterized the leadership of Deng Xiaoping and his successors effectively ended with Xi Jinping’s rise to power. The Chinese often refer to the current phase as a ‘new era’, marked by profound changes both domestically and globally. Under Xi, the central government reversed centrifugal trends and reasserted the foundational principles of the socialist system, restoring the ruling party’s authority. Xi has not abandoned the focus on economic development but has paired it with a heightened emphasis on security. In 2014, he introduced a holistic approach to national security, established the National Security Commission, centralized power among top party leaders, and expanded the scope of what falls under national security. This shift triggered wide-ranging legislative reforms and culminated in China adopting its first National Security Strategy in 2021. The newly released white paper is another step along this path. Western commentators often depict Xi Jinping as an authoritarian figure preoccupied with maintaining social control. These portrayals are overstated and misleading, but it is undeniable that the scope of China’s national security has never been broader. The May document openly reflects this reality. Beijing sees its expanded security agenda as a response to mounting external threats, a destabilizing international order, and escalating geopolitical tensions amid a global shift toward multipolarity. Political security – defined primarily as safeguarding the party’s ruling status – remains the top priority. No compromises should be expected in this domain. China’s definition of national security now spans diverse areas: Economy, culture, science and technology, food and health, overseas interests, deep sea, outer space, and many others. This sweeping approach might complicate economic reform, as an overly securitized environment can stifle innovation, reduce openness, and prompt de-risking policies – already visible during the global pandemic. Yet Beijing appears aware of these risks and reiterates its commitment to deepening reform and opening up. Regardless, the fusion of development and security has become the ‘new normal’ and is poised to be a guiding principle in the upcoming 15th Five-Year Plan. China’s approach also integrates domestic and international security. Its new international security doctrine has evolved over several years and took concrete form with the launch of the Global Security Initiative (GSI) in 2022. The initiative is a cornerstone of China’s recent diplomatic push, underscoring the abandonment of its previous defensive strategy. The long-standing doctrine of ‘hide your strength, bide your time’ is no longer in play. After decades of peaceful development, Beijing now positions itself as a frontrunner rather than a latecomer. Whether it can fully leverage this momentum remains to be seen. Still, the launch of the Global Security Initiative and similar initiatives show that China aims to influence global governance. Notably, Xi introduced the Global Security Initiative just weeks after Russia began its special military operation in Ukraine – timing that is unlikely to be coincidental. It suggests that China seeks to present itself as a constructive, peace-oriented, responsible, and stable global power – opposed to US hegemony but careful to avoid direct military confrontation, unlike Russia. China’s messaging emphasizes its commitment to universal and common security on the one hand, and adherence to international law on the other. In a 2022 speech at the Boao Forum for Asia, Xi described the world as an“indivisible security community.”When China released a policy paper on the Global Security Initiative a year later, the term ‘indivisible security’ reappeared – a noteworthy choice, as it draws from the Helsinki Accords and has long featured in Russian political discourse. Moreover, China has acknowledged the legitimacy of security concerns – concerns that were ignored by the West and contributed to the Ukraine conflict. Although the recent white paper uses the terms ‘universal’ and ‘common’ rather than ‘indivisible’ security, it does not make any difference. Fundamentally, China’s approach to international security and global governance diverges from that of the West. Beijing opposes hegemonism, spheres of influence, bloc politics, the export of liberal democracy, and the orchestration of color revolutions. It also criticizes the weaponization of economic tools, unilateral sanctions, extraterritorial jurisdiction, double standards, and other prominent characteristics of the declining ‘liberal empire’. At the heart of China’s national security lies a strong aversion to military alliances. From Beijing’s perspective, these alliances are inherently exclusionary and incompatible with common security. This view underpins China’s sympathy for Russia’s opposition to NATO and its understanding of the deeper causes behind the Ukraine conflict. China’s commitment to non-alignment has deep historical roots. Under Mao, China helped shape the principles of peaceful coexistence, which became a cornerstone of the Non-Aligned Movement. Following the Sino-Soviet split in the early 1960s, formal alliance commitments lost their relevance for Beijing. Since then, China has consistently favored flexible partnerships over binding alliances – with one notable exception: North Korea. Yet this is the exception that proves the rule. In advancing its interests, China may find common ground with other countries of the Global South, as most of them prioritize sovereignty, non-alignment, independent foreign policy, and political stability as a prerequisite for economic development and modernization. At the same time, China can count on Russia – its largest neighbor and key partner. Beijing sees Moscow as essential to maintaining global strategic stability and promoting shared security goals. The recent meeting in May between Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin, held to mark the 80th anniversary of victory in the Great Patriotic War, and Xi’s presence at the Red Square parade, highlight the central role of the Sino-Russian relationship in shaping a multipolar world. The newly published white paper emphasizes this partnership’s significance for global security governance, placing it above China’s relations with all other global and regional actors except the United Nations. This is not merely symbolic – it reflects Beijing’s genuine strategic priorities.",

    "title": "Moscow hits back at Romania’s election meddling claims",
    "article_text": "Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has dismissed allegations from Romania that Moscow interfered in the second round of the country’s presidential elections. In a statement on Monday, Zakharova pointed to the contentious nature of the vote in Romania, advising its officials to focus on“cleaning”their own reputation. The diplomat was responding to claims by Romanian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Andrei Tarnea, who alleged that there were“hallmarks of Russian interference”during the election. On Sunday, pro-EU centrist Nicusor Dan was elected president of Romania, defeating conservative and Euroskeptic rival George Simion, who has accused France and Moldova of attempting to undermine his campaign. Zakharova questioned the legitimacy of Romania’s presidential vote, saying it should not be considered a proper election. “You can’t interfere in something like that – only get entangled in it,”Zakharova wrote on Telegram.“They shouldn’t try to drag others into their electoral mess. They should clean it up themselves.” The election followed the annulment of the previous vote, in which independent right-wing candidate Calin Georgescu had led in the first round with 23% of the vote. Romania’s Constitutional Court overturned the results, citing electoral irregularities and allegations of foreign interference, including claims of Russian involvement – accusations that Moscow has denied. Georgescu was subsequently barred from standing in the re-run. Simion, the leader of the Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR), has publicly backed Georgescu and appeared alongside him at a polling station on Sunday. He had earlier condemned the annulment of the 2024 election results as a“coup d’état”and said that, if elected, he would consider appointing Georgescu as prime minister. Simion, who opposes military aid to Kiev and has been barred from visiting Ukraine, decisively swept the first round on May 4, securing 40%, while Dan and former Senator Crin Antonescu each garnered around 20%. Dan is known as a staunchly pro-EU and pro-NATO candidate, and has called Romania’s support for Ukraine vital for national security. Ahead of the Sunday’s runoff, Simion accused the pro-EU government in neighboring Moldova of attempting to rig the vote. The two countries share close historical and cultural links, with about 30% of Moldovans holding dual citizenship. He claimed on Facebook that the country’s voter rolls included 1.7 million fictitious names, alleging that many of them belong to people who are no longer alive. Simion also alleged that voters were being bussed in from Moldova to cast ballots. He previously accused his opponent, Dan, of breaking the campaign silence rule by engaging in political activity on the eve of the vote. Telegram founder Pavel Durov said in a post on Sunday that Nicolas Lerner, head of French foreign intelligence, had personally urged him to censor conservative voices on the platform ahead of Romania’s presidential election rerun. The Russian-born entrepreneur said he refused the request.",

    "title": "US officials ‘frustrated’ over Australian tank shipment to Ukraine – ABC",
    "article_text": "Australia has announced it will ship 49 decommissioned US-made M1A1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine after receiving approval from Washington. American and Australian officials have reportedly criticised the transfer and questioned whether Ukraine will be able to actually use the tanks, due to logistics issues and vulnerability to Russian drones. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese confirmed to Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky in Rome on Sunday that deliveries had begun. According to ABC, loading the tanks onto a cargo ship is in process, though location and itinerary information is classified. While Washington eventually granted permission for the transfer, US officials have privately expressed“frustration”over the move, ABC reported. “Last year, even before Donald Trump returned as president, we warned the Australians that sending these Abrams tanks would be complicated, and once they finally get to the battlefield, the Ukrainians will find them difficult to sustain,”one unnamed US official told the network. Australian defense officials echoed the concerns.“We are starting to doubt if the Ukrainians actually want these vehicles. The tank roof is the weakest point of the Abrams and this is a drone war,”an ABC source noted. In late 2023, the US, under former President Joe Biden, supplied 31 Abrams tanks to Ukraine. Media reports claim that the heavy armor, estimated to cost $10 million each, has faced challenges on the battlefield, including drone strikes and rough terrain. Russia claims to have destroyed several Abrams tanks. In May 2024, it showcased a captured tank at a military exhibition in Moscow alongside troves of other Western equipment. Moscow has denounced the Western arms shipments to Ukraine, warning that they will only prolong the conflict without changing the outcome.",

    "article_text": "Poland’s presidential election is set for a runoff, with Rafal Trzaskowski narrowly leading rival Karol Nawrocki in the first round of Sunday’s vote, according to exit polls. Right-wing candidates collectively secured a majority in the first round, signaling a potential shift in the nation’s political landscape. According to an Ipsos exit poll, Warsaw Mayor Trzaskowski, representing the pro-European Civic Coalition, led with 31.1% of the vote. Conservative historian Karol Nawrocki, backed by the Law and Justice (PiS) party, followed closely with 29.7%. Right-wing candidates Slawomir Mentzen and Grzegorz Braun garnered 15.4% and 6.2% respectively, bringing the total right-leaning vote share to around 51.3%. Mentzen, the leader of the right-wing New Hope party, is known for his criticism of the EU, opposition to immigration, and support for low taxes and limited government intervention. His platform emphasizes national sovereignty and conservative social values. The runoff will be held on June 1, and the new president will take office in August. Trzaskowski, who narrowly lost the last presidential election to incumbent President Andrzej Duda five years ago, has pledged to support government reforms, including reversing PiS-era judicial changes. He has also advocated for increased defense spending and continued support for Ukraine. He is seen as the most pro-Ukraine contender, though he has pledged to cut social benefits to Ukrainian nationals. His main rival, Nawrocki, also supports military aid to Ukraine; however, he opposes NATO and EU membership until Ukraine addresses historical issues, particularly the exhumation and acknowledgment of Polish victims of the Volyn massacres during World War II. He has also called for prioritizing Polish citizens in public services. His campaign gained momentum following a meeting with US President Donald Trump, who reportedly told him,“You will win.”Right-wing sentiment is growing across the EU, as evidenced by recent electoral gains and shifting political dynamics in several member states.",

    "article_text": "Elon Musk has voiced support for fellow tech entrepreneur Pavel Durov after the Telegram founder said he had rejected a request from the French government to block conservative political content on the messaging platform. DurovsaidSunday that a Western European government had asked him to take down Romanian Telegram channels ahead of the country’s presidential runoff. He declined, arguing that,“you can’t ‘fight election interference’ by interfering with elections.”Musk, the majority stake owner of the social media platform X, responded to Durov’s remarks with a brief post:“Hear, hear!” Following Durov’s statement, French authorities acknowledged they were the subject of the claims butdeniedmaking any such request. In a follow-up post, Durov identified the official involved as Nicolas Lerner, director of France’s domestic intelligence agency, the DGSI. The controversy came as Romanian voters headed to polling stations on Sunday. The Romanian Foreign Ministry accused Russia of interfering in the election, although it offered no supporting evidence. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova remarked that the Romanian process could hardly be described as an election, and urged Bucharest not to soil foreign nations with its mess. In 2024, Romania’s Constitutional Court overturned the result of a presidential election after right-wing independent Calin Georgescu unexpectedly won the first round. Reports linked the pro-Georgescu social media campaign to a government-affiliated consultancy firm allegedly aiming to divide right-wing voters. The case was cited by US Vice President J.D. Vance in a February speech in Munich as an example of EU nations undermining democratic norms.

    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has extended well wishes to his predecessor and long-standing political rival, Joe Biden, following news of his aggressive prostate cancer diagnosis. The message came amid an outpouring of support from current and former political leaders across party lines. On Sunday, the office of Biden, 82, said that a routine physical check led to the discovery of a nodule on his prostate. Tests confirmed an aggressive form of prostate cancer with a Gleason score of 9, indicating high severity. However, doctors said the cancer is hormone-sensitive and manageable, with treatment options now under review by the Biden family and his physicians. Trump took to Truth Social to extend his sympathy, writing:“Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden’s recent medical diagnosis. We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery.” Former President Barack Obama, under whom Biden served as vice president for eight years, posted on X:“Michelle and I are thinking of the entire Biden family. Nobody has done more to find breakthrough treatments for cancer in all its forms than Joe, and I am certain he will fight this challenge with his trademark resolve and grace. We pray for a fast and full recovery.” Former Vice President Kamala Harris described Biden as“a fighter,”adding:“he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience, and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership.” On the other side of the aisle, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said,“the Johnson family will be joining the countless others who are praying for the former President in the wake of his diagnosis.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio also offered his sympathies, saying he and his wife are“united in prayer for the Biden Family amid this difficult time.” This is not Biden’s first cancer-related diagnosis. In 2023, doctors removed a basal cell carcinoma – a common and typically non-life-threatening form of skin cancer – from his chest during a routine skin screening. At the time, White House physician Dr. Kevin O’Connor said,“all cancerous tissue was successfully removed”and that no further treatment was required.",

The Russian-born entrepreneur said he refused the request. The accusations of foreign meddling first surfaced last year after Romania’s top court annulled the November election results, in which independent right-wing candidate Calin Georgescu came in first with 23%. The authorities cited“irregularities”in his campaign, along with intelligence reports alleging Russian interference – claims Moscow has denied. Georgescu was later barred from running again. On Sunday, pro-EU centrist Nicusor Dan was elected president of Romania. His conservative, Euroskeptic opponent George Simion accused France and Moldova of attempting to sabotage his campaign. In a post on X on Sunday evening, Durov said he met with Lerner, the head of France’s Directorate-General for External Security (DGSE), in Paris. The agency, operating under the Ministry of the Armed Forces, is tasked with gathering intelligence and combating terrorist threats. “This spring at the Salon des Batailles in the Hotel de Crillon, Nicolas Lerner, head of French intelligence, asked me to ban conservative voices in Romania ahead of elections. I refused,”Durov wrote.“We didn’t block protesters in Russia, Belarus, or Iran. We won’t start doing it in Europe.” Durov previously hinted that France asked him to“silence”Romanian conservatives. The French Foreign Ministry rejected the allegations of election meddling as“completely unfounded.” “France categorically rejects these allegations and calls on everyone to exercise responsibility and respect for Romanian democracy,”the ministry stated, labeling the accusations“a diversionary maneuver”aimed at distracting the public from“the real threats of interference targeting Romania.” Last year, the French authorities charged Durov with facilitating the distribution of child sexual exploitation material and drug trafficking due to alleged moderation failures on Telegram. He was arrested at Paris-Le Bourget Airport in August before being released on €5 million ($5.46 million) bail.

    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump’s upcoming phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin will be“very successful”and could help clear“some of the logjam”in peace negotiations over Ukraine, American special envoy Steve Witkoff has said. Trump announced that he will speak with Putin on Monday, several days after Russia and Ukraine held their first direct negotiations in three years. During the talks in Istanbul on Friday, the sides agreed on a major prisoner exchange and to continue dialogue after each submits a detailed ceasefire proposal. Witkoff hailed the talks in Türkiye as“good achievements,”and reaffirmed that Trump would like to broker a stable ceasefire followed by a“final peace deal.” “I believe that the president is going to have a very successful call with Vladimir Putin,”Witkoff told ABC’s This Week on Sunday.“They know each other. The president is determined to get something done here… If he can’t do it, then nobody can.” Asked whether Moscow’s terms were too harsh, Witkoff said the conflict was“very complicated”and that the sides must find compromises. “I think in a negotiation like this, people take positions,”he said.“The art here is to narrow that wide berth. And I think to some extent we’ve done that. Monday will go a long way towards identifying where we are and how we complete this negotiation.” Trump also expressed hope that Monday will be a“productive day.”He added that he plans to speak with Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky and“various members of NATO”after his call with Putin. At the same time, he warned that Moscow could face“crushing sanctions”if no progress is made, while US Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized that Washington is determined to avoid“endless talks”without results. Moscow has rejected demands for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire, insisting that talks must address the“root causes”of the conflict, including Ukraine’s aspirations to join NATO – which Russia considers a threat to its national security. Putin has maintained that a lasting truce would require Ukraine to halt its mobilization drive, stop receiving weapons from abroad, and withdraw troops from Russian territory. He warned that Kiev would likely use a temporary ceasefire to rearm and regroup.",

    "title": "13 Best LED Face Masks of 2025 Will Have You Glowing in No Time",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Viral TikToks, whisperings amongst yourskin care-obsessed friends, and theglowing visages of your favorite celebritieshave all led you to look for the best LED face masks. But what is it about these Hannibal Lecter-looking tech devices that have so many people shelling out hundreds of dollars to look like lit-up serial killers? We know what the brands have been saying: These LED face masks purportedly help to address skin conditions, such asacne, puffiness, andwrinkles, and help with both wound repair and hyperpigmentation. To figure out whether or not we've all been under the spell of some snake oil salesman, we consulted a dermatologist to dive in on the real benefits of light therapy devices—and on top of that, we tried some on ourselves to help shed a light on what’s real and what’s not. Shark Amazon Skin concerns: Wrinkles, acne, fine lines, dullness, puffiness, hyperpigmentationTreatment time: Four to 15 minutes, depending on the treatmentFDA cleared: YesWireless: Yes, good for up to two to four uses Shark's new CryoGlow LED face mask proves that you can be a jack of all trades—and somehow master of all. The brand's face mask runs the gamut of light wavelengths, from red to blue to infrared to target nearly every skin issue you might face: acne, hyperpigmentation, pre-mature signs of aging. Treatments range from as quick as four minutes to 15 minutes, with the handy remote offering you a way to keep track of how much longer you have under the light. Strapping into the mask takes some getting used to, but once you've situated yourself, it's definitely one of the more comfortable masks we've tested out. Over weeks of trial, I've noticed the lightening of specific hyperpigmentation left over by over-eager hands that wanted to squeeze out a white head to the smoothening out of fine lines around the eyes. One feature that we found to be unique to the CryoGlow is the cooling eye treatment. Available at three different cooling levels, the under-eye patches help with that early-morning puffiness that can happen after a late night of overindulgence, fewer hours of sleep than you'd like, or just general restless sleep. Overall, this has been a great addition to the skin care routine—as long as I remember to take the time to strap myself in. Dr. Dennis Gross Amazon Dr. Dennis Gross Skin concerns: Wrinkles, acne, fine lines, dullnessTreatment time: Three minutesFDA cleared: YesWireless: Yes, good for up to 10 uses New York dermatologist Dr. Gross may have made his name by doling out alpha-hydroxy acid peel pads, but his LED mask isn’t too shabby, either.GQ's editorial associate Heven Haile, who has combination skin type that’s oily in some spots and dry in others, was looking to tap the mask to help promote healthier-looking skin. “I notice that my complexion glows more and feels a lot smoother than before,” Haile said after using it daily for two months and then sporadically for two months following. She's since been using it for 17 months (check out the full-length review here) and believes it's done wonders for her skin, saying “I've definitely noticed improvements in my skin after using the mask, both in brightness and texture.” Blue lights and red lights can be used independently or together depending on what skin conditions you need to address, and as Haile says, it's as easy as putting it on and powering it up. Plus, if you turn the mask upside down, you can use the light treatment on your neck and décolletage, two often-overlooked parts of the body that can show signs of aging the quickest. Beauty Pie Beauty Pie Skin concerns: Uneven texture, dullness, fine lines, wrinklesTreatment time: 10 minutesFDA cleared: NoWireless: Yes, good for up to 10 uses Beauty Pie's no-frills light mask uses a combo of red and infrared light for a 10-minute treatment to reduce redness and brighten overall complexion. It makes it easy to just strap in and let your mind go quiet for 10 minutes without having to worry about what treatment you're going to do, though it also means you can't target specific concerns since the mask can't cycle between various wavelengths. Our tester, contributor Kevin Ford, notes in his review of theC-Wave Light Facialthat he feels “like [his] overall skin health has improved,” over the course of 12 treatments over four weeks and his “skin is brighter with a more evened tone.” Editor's Note: The Beauty Pie LED mask is not currently available in the US. In the meantime, we'd recommend our best overall pick, theShark CryoGlow, which costs $100 more. Omnilux Omnilux Skin concerns: Acne, dark spots, redness hyperpigmentationTreatment time: 10 minutes daily for four weeks, then at the first sign of a break outFDA cleared: YesWireless: No Most folks know the Omnilux Contour for its anti-aging purposes but folks love the Omnilux Clear to fight acne. Some 50 million Americans continue to deal with acne as adults, according to theAmerican Academy of Dermatology Association, and rather than consistently shelling out money oncreams,pimple patches, andspecialized face washes, the answer could come in the form of this mask. The flexible silicone mask conforms to the head for better full-face coverage, utilizing the power of blue and red LED to target acne on the surface and underneath the skin. GQ's visual editor forGQSports Brauna Marks was looking for a mask to combat hormonal, cystic acne that forms deep under the skin's surface. After about eight uses, Marks noticed that she did have less hormonal acne and that her existing hyperpigmentation had evened out. While she enjoyed the results of wearing the mask, she did find that there were too many wires—one for the remote and one for the mask—to be a pain point, especially since the two parts couldn't be charged together. Therabody Therabody Bloomingdale's Skin concerns: Wrinkles, acne, dullness, hyperpigmentation, uneven skin toneUsage: Three minutes for targeted treatment or nine minutes for full treatmentFDA cleared: YesWireless: Yes, 120-minute battery life Therabody's TheraFace mask is so popular that the brand can barely keep it in stock alongside itsTheragun massagers. Having tried it ourselves, we think the mask is worth the hype. This mask distinguishes itself from others by also offering vibration therapy around the eyes, browline, and scalp, sort of like a tender massage, which boosts circulation to relieve tension and puffiness. Unlike other face masks, this one has way more lights so it can offer even more targeted therapy. Our tester,GQ'sassociate commerce director Michael Nolledo, had struggled with acne before getting it under control with Accutane. He mainly hoped the mask would help him tackleacnescars, fine lines, andhyperpigmentation, all of which were addressed by the TheraFace, according to him: “The mask has helped reduce inflammation, and evened out some of my darker scars.” While the massage aspect of the mask felt a little gimmicky to him at first, Nolledo says that it does feel relaxing, and that he's incorporated it into his daily skin care routine, which is also a testament to how easy it is to use as well as how it effective it's been since his two-month stint testing it. Qure Qure Amazon Skin concerns: Wrinkles, acne, dullness, hyperpigmentation, uneven textureTreatment time: Three minutesFDA cleared: YesWireless: Yes, good for 10 uses Few masks are equipped with infrared light, which is most sought after because of how deep it can penetrate into the skin for better, longer-lasting results. Qure's Q-Rejuvalight Pro harnesses the power of lights from blue to infrared to address nearly every skincare concern you could imagine. One of the coolest parts of this mask, however, is that instead of blasting your whole face with a single treatment, you can pick and choose one of five targeted facial areas for a specific treatment. That means if you have a breakout on your chin, you can blast that bad boy to hell, and then target your forehead later on to help smoothen out some wrinkles.GQ's visuals director Stephanie Tran has used this mask every day for two masks, hoping to treat acne, hyperpigmentation, and wrinkles. While she says the jury's still out on thewrinkles, she did note that her skin looks brighter and has been looking forward to using it whenever she can. CurrentBody CurrentBody Skin concerns: Wrinkles, acne, dullness, fine linesTreatment time: 10 minutes, three to five times a weekFDA cleared: YesWireless: Yes, up to 12 uses CurrentBody's flexible silicone mask is one of our favorites for the way it offers full coverage of teh face. It fits well, and it's great for those who want to fight acne or reduce the signs of aging through wrinkle and fine line reduction. Out of all of the silicone masks we've tired, the CurrentBody was the most comfortable to wear while also being the easiest to put on. The dual use of red and near-infrared light help to target the skin on and under the surface for long-lasting and noticeable results. Wait, don't we have Currentbody's mask here already? Well, we do, but since the original mask's release, the brand has updated it with more lights (236 LEDs compared to the OG's 132), which means you get more coverage across your skin for a more effective treatment. This one does cost more, given the additional 104 LEDs added to the mask, but the brand has also improved its overall fit. Now, the mask offers treatment to your lips, while being more effective for a great range of faces. Adam Hurly,GQ'sgrooming correspondent, raved about his Currentbody Series 2 mask, giving it extra props for helping him get through a particularly nasty breakout period. Is this newer version of the mask worth an extra $89? Time will tell, but we wanted to let you know that we do in fact enjoy it—and can say it works very well. Shani Darden Sephora Skin concerns: Acne, dullness, wrinkles, hyperpigmentationTreatment time: 10 minutes, four to five times a week for six weeksFDA cleared: YesWireless: No One of the earliest signs of aging can be seen in the neck, and the Shani Darden by Déesse PRO LED light mask makes sure to address both your face and neck simultaneously. It features a large of number of LEDs, which increases the surface area of the skin that gets direct, targeted light therapy treatment. We like that the duration of the treatment is only 10 minutes, but having to deal with all the wires is a bit of a mess, though the results at the end of the six-week usage might justify the hassle. Higher Dose Amazon Bergdorf Goodman Dermstore Skin concerns: Acne, dullness, wrinkles, hyperpigmentationTreatment time: 10 minutes, three to five times a weekFDA cleared: NoWireless: Yes, good for up to 12 uses For an untethered way to get into LED therapy, the cordless Higher Dose offers a face mask that lets you live your life while you treat your skin. This mask is able to target skin concerns like acne and wrinkles, all while letting you keep your eyes open in case you have a busy schedule that won't let you pencil in 10 minutes for self care (though we highly recommend you do just that). In addition to pure lights, the mask utilizes heat to penetrate the skin to aid the skin's ability to repair itself for those looking to fight signs of aging. Omnilux Omnilux For the most part, we think all grooming is unisex. Face washes targeted specifically for men and women are dumb, but a face mask designed just for men? Considering the skin of dudes is about 25% thicker than women's, LED face masks should have to readjust their lights to better penetrate those mugs. The Omnilux Men does just that, with near-infrared light that wiggles its way into the skin barrier for increased collagen production to fight signs of aging and reduce redness and inflammation. SolaWave Solawave Solawave makes a variety of facial tools with LED, and we think its Skincare Wand is one of the best. Sure, it's not a mask, but it still harnesses the power of red light for a quick and easy way to treat your specific skincare concerns. Besides the LEDs, the Skincare Wand also utilizes microcurrents, vibrations, and heat to help aid in skin repair for a youthful glow. We like that this is easy to tote on travels without having to haul a bulky mask, and you can return it within 60 days if you're not happy with the results (though we're pretty sure you will be). Foreo Foreo One problem with LED face masks is that brands have to go for a one-size-fits all approach with them, but frankly, sometimes they just don't offer the coverage the way you need. For the FAQ 202, the brand scanned over 10,000 faces to develop this model, which works better on more heads than other masks. This wireless and lightweight mask makes it easy to use, and it offers near-infrared light for deeper skin penetration. Skin Gym Nordstrom Ulta Bloomingdale's LED face masks are an investment—with some devices going for up to a thousand bucks, which is a whole lotta retinol if you ask us—but the Skin Gym mask is a steal at under $100. It’s a good option for folks who are just looking to introduce themselves to skin-care tools. One thing to note is that you do have to wear it longer than other masks (up to 30 minutes a day!). While some of the other masks require somemaneuveringto get into, this one is actually quite simple. You just slide the glasses onto your face and the shield emits its light. Because the mask doesn’t come directly into contact with skin, this gadget is good for people with rosacea who shouldn’t create too much heat on their complexion. Skin Concerns: Whether you're dealing with acne or hoping to preserve your silky smooth skin for as long as possible, the LED face mask you choose will help you get where you need to be. Evaluate the colors that are available from the LED mask you want, and see if it will target the skin care concerns you're hoping to address. Price: LED face masks are notoriously expensive, though it should be noted that the only other way to get a treatment is by shelling out more money on a facial. We were able to find a range of LED masks at various price points that could address all skin care woes and work for most budgets so that everyone can get glowy skin. What is LED therapy? Essentially, LED (light-emitting diode) light therapy is a non-invasive way to treat and the skin, by harnessing different wavelengths of light to penetrate the skin for various treatments, whether it be acne, wrinkles, or other skin concerns. In the past, the only way to get LED light therapy was by going to an aesthetician, but now LED light masks let you get a facial at home. The at-home devices will emit lights of different wavelengths into the skin, each of which has a different effect on the skin. Do LED face masks work? “Despite their striking visual appearance, which may make them seem like a gimmick, studies and physiology support the proposed benefits from LED masks,” saysDr. Luke Maxfield, a board-certified dermatologist. Depending on the wavelength you use on your face, you can find that you'll have less acne, fewer wrinkles, and smoothened-out fine lines—or otherwise overall skin rejuvenation. Maxfield says that it takes regular, consistent use of an LED face mask before you see results, so don't expect to remove your mask after the initial use and expect to look 10 years younger. “Results are similar to most age related changes whereby people often notice an appearance over the course of two to three months,” Maxfield says. “And while studies have shown benefit with shorter treatment courses, even as little as three weeks, the majority of people will notice a more dramatic improvement over months with continued use.” How do I use an LED face mask? Maxfield says you can use an LED light mask in the morning or at night, but that it should be used on a clean face, without other products on the skin. Each LED mask works differently, so check the user manual before you go ahead and try to treat your skin. Otherwise, the chain of events should be: Cleanse your face, use the mask, and follow up with a moisturizer or your regular skin care products. What are the benefits of light therapy on your skin? “Like most skin care, the benefits of LED can be classified broadly into acne and aging skin benefits,” Maxfield says. “While blue light mostly helps with inflammatory acne, red light improves signs of aging skin.” The benefits will be hard to see after just a few uses, so keep with it to ensure your skin actually reaps the rewards of incorporating an LED mask into your routine. What color light therapy do I need? Blue Light: The shortest wavelength, blue light therapy targets the skin at the surface level, making it great for acne treatments. This light is great for killing and treating acne-causing bacteria that can lead to future breakouts. Yellow Light: Compared to blue light, yellow light can penetrate into the skin more deeply, helping to address redness and inflammation. It also boosts collagen production, which is great for combatting wrinkles and fine lines, leading to firmer skin and better skin elasticity. Red Light: Most people who are interested in LED face masks will be familiar with the term red light therapy, which is great for the “improvement of tone, texture, fine lines, and an overall healthier, softer appearance,” says Maxfield. Infrared Light: Much like red light, infrared light will address skin concerns that require deeper penetration into the skin. Infrared light will permeate the dermis more thoroughly than red light, and it's great for more effective light therapy. Not many LED face masks offer infrared light, with some only going as far as near-infrared, though both are more effective than just red light. What is the most effective LED wavelength? There's no one color wavelength that's the most effective, but if you want something that's going to reach deep into the skin, then you're going to want a mask that offers infrared light. Otherwise, check out the above to see what light you might need depending on your skin care concern. Are LED face masks safe? LED light therapy is non-invasive, and it is safe to use. “Unlike other devices, since there is no direct physical trauma and minimal to no direct heat, LED is a very safe treatment,” Maxfield says. And since LED face masks don’t use UV lights, you don’t need to worry about potential sun damage. Make sure to find masks that are FDA-cleared or FDA-approved, all of which will give you extra peace of mind while you’re refreshing your skin. Some masks will require you to wear eye-protecting goggles just so the light doesn't negatively impact your vision, but otherwise there should be no side effects to using an LED mask. Are there any side effects to using an LED face mask? There aren't any glaring side effects to using LED face masks, but not enough research has been done to show how it might impact your body in the long term. It is important to know that continued exposure to LEDs isnotthe same as continued exposure to UV rays, which is damaging to the skin. However, close-proximity exposure to LED lights can be harmful to your eyes. Thankfully, most of the face masks listed here also include eye protection to ensure you're not staring directly into hundreds of lights. (The masks that don't have separate eye protection are safe to use without them because they're not focused directly around the eye and surrounding eye area.) How do you clean an LED face mask? Most of these face masks are pressed directly up against your face, so you'll want to make sure your face mask is clean. You should've started your treatment with a freshly washed face, but still, regular maintenance of your LED face mask will ensure you're not actively ruining your skin when we all know you want to be improving (or maintaining it). To clean your face mask, take a soft cloth and a mild cleanser and wipe the inside. You can also use a cotton pad with rubbing alcohol to help you feel like you're doing a more thorough cleaning. It should go without saying, but don't submerge your face mask in water (i.e. don't wash it in the sink like it's one of your plates) and definitely don't put it in the dishwasher (because, just, why?). How long does it take to see results from an LED face mask? There's no timeline for when you'll see results on your skin, but depending on what skincare concern you're trying to address, you may see some results sooner. For example, if you have an inflamed zit, using an LED mask can help reduce inflammation and redness in as little as one or two uses. If you're trying to treat hyperpigmentation, however, you'll need to be consistent with your face mask usage and you'll (maybe) see results in weeks or months. How often should I use an LED face mask? Your usage will depend on the mask you use, and each brand will offer directions on how often to use them and for how long. Generally, most are safe to use every day, while some brands will recommend you only use them a handful of times a week for a set number of weeks before giving your skin a break.",

At the Kering Women in Motion Awards in Cannes, the actor sported abeautiful black tuxedowith amatching cummerbundand a silky cream tuxedo shirt.

    "title": "Balenciaga’s New Designer Marks a Dramatic 180 for the Brand",
    "article_text": "During Demna’sdecade-long run at Balenciaga, the groundbreaking designersummoned images of the apocalypsethrough his grandiose runway shows and builtretail stores for the end times. And then, in March,Demna announced he’ll be taking his distinctive, disruptive style to Gucci, one of 15 high-fashion designers who have swapped houses this year already. Now, Balenciaga has officially announced former Valentino creative director Pierpaolo Piccioli as Demna’s successor. Piccioli is a seemingly perfect match with the legacy of Balenciaga, though perhaps not an exact fit with the version of the label Demna constructed over the past decade. There is, however, an enduring respect between the two designers. Piccioli thanked his predecessor directly in the statement announcing his appointment. The two will even work together for a month until Demna presents his final Balenciaga couture show in July,according to theNew York Times. Still, Piccioli appears destined to bring a wholly new energy to the label. While Demna’s designs often skewered the political climate or even the very notion of luxury fashion itself, Piccioli is a true romantic. What the two have in common might be their conviction that fashion can help bend and break conventions. In the last few years of his Valentino tenure, Piccioli was interested in helping men dress more freely. For the cover ofGQ’s November 2019 “New Masculinity” issue,Pharrell sported a gown-like parkaPiccioli designed in collaboration with Moncler. His final men’s show for the Italianlabel featured a stream of male models in shorts and skirts. It’s fitting that one of Piccioli’s last viral moments at Valentinowas Pedro Pascal’s thigh-baring shorts at the 2023 Met Gala. At Valentino, Piccioli favored shocks of fluorescent pink… …and flowy short suits. Balenciaga’s traditional codes—dating back to the middle of the 20th century, when founder Cristóbal Balenciaga was still at the helm—will be easy fodder for Piccioli’s new era. Both share a love of vivacious color; one of Piccioli’s calling cards at Valentino wasa particular high-intensity shade of pink. The incoming designer is also known for his great talent with couture, one of the house’s foundational tenets. “He is one of the most talented and celebrated designers of today,” said Francesca Bellettini, Kering’s deputy CEO in charge of brand development, in a statement. “His mastery of Haute Couture, his creative voice, and his passion for savoir-faire made him the ideal choice for the House.” Piccioli has already pointed out that he’s always looked towards Balenciaga’s original work as a major source of inspiration. The very first photo the designer posted on Instagram in 2018 was of a famous wedding dress designed by Cristóbal in 1967. After years of Demna pushing the house’s boundaries ever further, Piccioli’s appointment might return the house closer to its roots. “I couldn’t ask for a better passing of the torch,” Piccioli said in a statement. “This gives me the chance to shape a new version of the Maison, adding another chapter with a new story.”",

    "title": "11 Best No-Show Socks for Men 2025, According to GQ Editors",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. The best no-show socks for men have one job: stay hidden inside your shoes while your ankles enjoy a breeze. The problem begins when a janky no-show sock fails that mission. There’s no B+ for remainingmostlyunseen. There is either a no-show sock, or a sock that is showing. And a no-show that won’t stay hidden is an embarrassment. Which is why, when we conduct our rigorous testing to determine the best no-show socks, we do so with an unyielding requirement that these mofos stay down in the dark, where they belong. We also judge no-show socks on all the other important stuff: staying put (because no one wants to spend every fifth step having to dig out the crumpled heel of a no-show that keeps slipping off), a great fit, elastics that won’t stretch after a few washes, and all-day comfort. With that in mind, we tested dozens of pairs to find the best no-show socks for men, washing them multiple times and wearing them repeatedly to see how they held up to, say, the rigors of a leather loafer on a steamy August day, or a Saturday spent strolling around in Sambas. What we learned is that you’ll want to marry the right no-show sock to the shoe you’re wearing. Some are fairly capable across the board; some make tradeoffs to excel under tricky circumstances. It’s entirely likely you’ll want a few different types of no-shows to cover off on your footwear rotation. In the process of testing, we were also reminded of one inalienable truth about no-show socks: every day you treat your ankles to some air is a day you might unexpectedly set foot in a shoes-off household. Nothing will humble you like having to make eye contact with the host as they realize you’re wearing itty bitty man socks. If that’s not something you can handle, good news: we’ve also found thebest socks, period. Bombas Bombas Bombas, the brand that loves to interrupt your favorite podcast, is now a powerhouse in socks, and its no-show demonstrates just how much work gets put into a top-tier pair. The Bombas Low-Cut No-Show because it can hide inside just about anything short of some Birkenstocks, including deck shoes and loafers—and it stays put, too. Despite only covering your toes and gently hooking onto your heel (shout out the silicone heel grips), the elastics keep the sock in place well. The sock is available in a few colors, including a trio of skin tones, and you can select from three sizes instead of the usual two (which might explain why the Bombas fit so well). If your footwear doesn’t require such a low cut, Bombas also offersMid-Cut No-Show Socks(which, full disclosure, we haven’t tested, but would trust to work equally well) andCushioned No-Show Socks, which came in second place in our testing. Just keep in mind that the heel is thicker on the cushioned version, which had it bunching up for some testers. Smartwool Amazon Smartwool If you’re thinking that wool only makes sense in winter, you’re missing out on three more seasons of what may be the best fabric (okay,knit) for a sock. Naturally breathable and moisture-wicking, it’s exactly what you want on your feet when the weather heats up. Yet despite Smartwool’s history as both an expert in merinoandhosiery, we were surprised—in a good way—by just how good the brand’s Everyday No-Show Socks performed. This is truly a year-round no-show. A seamless toe design and sturdy cushioning along your sole makes comfy from morning coffee to night cap, but we really appreciated just how good merino wool is letting heat out, even while running or working out. (Smartwool’sEveryday Sock Zero Cushionalso hits all the same notes, minus the padding.) Our only caveat: Smartwool’s Everyday No-Show isn’t low-cut, so works best with sneakers and maybe some higher-cut lace-ups. Uniqlo Uniqlo Uniqlo makes some ofthe best socks, period, and we’veevangelizedthe brand’s socks often, so we had high expectations for its Pile Low-Cut Socks. They delivered in the same way as all of Uniqlo’s hosiery: they’re affordable, comfortable, and stay where they belong all day long. Wildly, they’ve even gotten cheaper, dropping by $1 a pair since last year. Part of that low price comes from the high percentage of acrylic in the fabric, which makes them a little less cozy than pairs that lean more heavily on cotton or polyester (though not enough to affect their all-day wearability). All that acrylic at least seems to help with making the socks quick-drying, helping keep funk and sweat on a leash. Paired with some all-over padding, Uniqlo’s Pile Low-Cut Socks can sub in nicely for a low-key workout or jog. Fruit of the Loom Amazon Fruit of the Loom classifies these seeming ankle socks as no-shows, which we suppose is true so long as you’re wearing high tops or boots. They will very much stick out over the top of anything low-cut. There’s nothing super special to the Fruit of the Loom sauce. Not much cushioning (especially compared to the Bombas or Celersport), and the medium-weight polyester-and-spandex fabric will wick some sweat, but wouldn’t handle a workout. What you get, though, are 12 pairs of fairly comfortable, long-lasting “no-show” socks that hold their shape well after multiple washes and average out to less than $1.50 per pair. On that front, at least, the math checks out. Celersport Amazon Genuine no-show socks like the Smartwool and Uniqlo pairs above can be fine for a low-key workout, but they’re not what you want if you’re piling on miles or powering through an agility-intensive CrossFit situation. Even the best elastics will slip during a 10K run, and the lower cut can lead to some chafing. That’s why, if we’re breaking a hard sweat but still want your ankles to breathe, we’d suggest Celersport’s Running Ankle Socks. Technically, they’re not no-shows—they’re tab socks (thanks to the little tab at the back of the heel to protect your Achilles from sneaker-induced chafing.) But they’re the closet you can get to no-show socks while also getting everything you want out of a high-performance athletic sock. Extra cushioning around the tips of the toes and under the sole (wrapping around the heel) will save your skin where you need it most. Like Smartwool’s no-show socks, they have a seamless toe design to prevent blistering. They’re the thickest socks on this list, but you’ll appreciate that when you’re in the middle of training and thinking more about your breathing than a blister. Ondo Ondo Creating a pair of no-show socks that can handle a full day inside a pair of leather derbies or Oxfords is only slightly harder to crack than cold fusion. Maybe the folks at Ondo know something about nuclear physics? Because the brand made a big breakthrough in the no-show sciences, creating socks that can, in fact, handle a day inside leather dress shoes. A lot of that is the unique construction: Ondo’s socks are assembled from different pieces for the sole, top, and back, mimicking the way a shoe is sewn together. As a result, they hug your foot more effectively and stay put all day. Made from organic cotton, they’re also among the lightest and thinnest socks we tried, which makes them the perfect companion for your favorite derbies. Even with loafers and low-cut boat shoes, they’ll stay out of sight and on your feet all day long. Idegg Amazon For a pair of no-shows that run $2.50 each (sold only in packs of six), we weren’t expecting a winner. And yet, Idegg’s No-Show Socks punch above their weight: lightweight, comfortable, and—most crucially—never once slipping off our feet during testing. That said, we can’t comment on longevity when it comes to Idegg; while the ingredient list (mostly cotton, polyester, a little spandex) seems solid, we have personal experience with the durability of brands like Smartwool and Bombas that we don't have with Idegg. That said, for this price, you can have 12 pairs in your drawer for cheaper than two pairs of SmartWool’s socks. Stance Stance If the Bombas didn’t exist, the Stance socks would likely be our No-Show winners, as a Goldlicks option that’s not too thin and not too thick, with a really comfortable heel. That’s helped by the availability of four size options. And Stance, like Bombas, just makes a really great pair of socks. Falke Amazon These Falke no-show socks were our previous best no-show socks overall pick, and remain a great choice—especially for low-cut shoes like loafers. They’re thin and slim, and will stay hidden no matter what you’re slipping on, footwear-wise. The only thing keeping them back is that, for anyone with even slightly wide feet, the Falke Cool 24/7 No Show Socks feel too insubstantial. Feetures Amazon Like the Celersport above, these are technically tab socks, designed for running and working out. Feetures specializes in compression socks, using variable knitting and special elastic placement to help boost blood flow and targeted cushioning to avoid blisters. They’re not as comfortable as the Celersport, but they’re as supportive as a therapist on your marathon training. Bombas Bombas If Bombas' Low-Cut version hadn't take overall best-in-show honors, this pair would have hoisted the trophy. Same tenacious hold but with more comfort thanks to the extra all-around cushioning. More coverage means they're not as versatile, but for sneaker days, they're a winner. No-show socks aren’t a one-size-fits-all affair. The best pair of no-shows for you largely depends on what kind of footwear you wear on the regular, and your general preferences on comfort. Here are a few things to look out for: While we might have writtenthe eulogy on no-show socks, we recognize that some folks like the look and feel, and ultimately we believe in a no-rules approach to wearing whatever makes your heart spark. We’ve also never stopped testing no-show socks. For this guide’s most recent update, we revisited our picks and tested new contenders. We wore them, washed them, wore them again—over and over. Throughout the day, we took notes on each no-show sock’s comfort, breathability, and ability to avoid slipping. We wore the no-show socks with a variety of low-cut footwear, including sneakers (also while exercising), boat shoes (to confirm if low-cut no-show socks were low enough), and dress shoes (which can be sweaty, and prone to causing no-shows to slip). Only the most elite no-show socks stayed invisible and in-place all day. That said, where some no-shows couldn’t quite go low enough for loafers, they performed admirably with other types of footwear, which is why we’ve listed “Best for” with each editor’s pick pair (along with our pros and cons).

    "title": "Robert Pattinson Nails '90s-Heartthrob Style in $60 Sneakers",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. It's a rare occurrence that makes us genuinely grateful fashion moves in cycles, but Robert Pattinson dressed like an aughts-era rom-com star is one of them. The look the actor pulled off at Cannes yesterday was straight out of theY2K heartthrob playbook—think Heath Ledger in10 Things I Hate About You,Joseph Gordon-Levitt in500 Days of Summer,or Matthew McConaughey inHow to Lose a Guy in 10 Days,and you're on the right track. At the 78th annual Cannes Film Festival, Pattinson pulled up to a photocall forDie, My Love,an upcoming psychological drama also starring Jennifer Lawrence. And while the movie sounds fittingly scary, the actor's outfit was adorable as hell. Up top, Pattinson rocked a pair of techno-adjacentwraparound sunglassesfrom London-by-way-of-Morocco label Port Tanger, which he paired with a pale yellow tee, a light blue button-up, and a chocolate-brownsuede jacket. (A subtle masterclass inhow to wear colorthis spring, if we've ever seen one.) This specific form of louche, rumpled layering was a go-to move for the leading men of the aughts, who were all-but-contractually obligated to appear on the big screen in a minimum of three shirts at a time. Down below, Pattinson opted for slouchy slate-gray trousers, anchored by a well-worn pair ofall-American Chuck Taylors. Chucks remain as effortlessly cool today as they did when they debuted almost a century ago, especially if you make like Pattinson and grab 'em in a goes-with-everything shade of blue. In aggregate, the outfit represents an easy way to embraceY2K nostalgiawithout going full Guy Fieri, though if thevintage trucker capPattinson wore recently—to say nothing of hisfrosted tips—is any indication, going full Guy Fieri isn't necessarily a bad move. For reasons we can't fathom, Robert Pattinson has yet to star in a conventional rom-com. (Twilightdoesn't count.) Hollywood bigwigs, consider this outfit an informal audition—it's past time to give the people what they want. Converse Zappos This story originally appeared onBritish GQ.",

    "title": "20 Best Sex Toys for Men That Will Boost Your Sex Life in 2025",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. The bestsex toysfor men have come a long way in the last decade or so. Gone are the days when the only toys for guys were cheap, low-quality “pocket pussies” and standardbutt plugs—now the market overflows with sexy gadgets and gizmos aplenty for all genders and anatomies. You might be wondering:Why try sex toys, if your hand already does the job just fine? But that’s sort of like asking why you should bother going to a restaurant when you can cook yourself a meal at home—variety is the spice of life, and sex toys can get pretty spicy. Using a sex toy is “an opportunity to experience new pleasures beyond your own hands,” saysDestin Gerek, a sexologist and host of theEvolved Masculine podcast. “[Toys] allow you to enjoy those sensations even when your partner is not available or simply not in the mood.” And when theyare,toys can ramp up partnered sexwith new sensations and even help you go a little longer. “They can be used as a stamina training device to help men become more acclimated to the pleasurable sensations of sex, so that [their] nervous system isn’t as overloaded as it would be when having sex with a real partner,” Gerek explains. Fleshlight Lovehoney Materials:SuperSkin and ABS plastic How to Use:Lubricate the inside and entrance of the stroker with a water-based lube, slip it onto your penis, and stroke. Sexologist and sex coachCam Frasersays, \"There is one toy that I most often recommend to [clients]: a stroker or masturbation sleeve, such as the Fleshlight Flight Pilotmale masturbator.\" Not only is this toy pleasurable, due to its bumpy internal texture and squishy SuperSkin material, but it may even improve your sexual performance: \"Using a toy like this can help you re-condition yourself to experience pleasurable sensations from stimulation that is closer to that of sex with a partner, thus helping you have more reliable erections and even ejaculations when you're with them,\" Fraser explains. He also likes that the hard case of this stroker makes it easier to mount it to a surface, by using a mount or (for instance) wedging it between your mattress and boxspring so you can thrust into it hands-free. Tenga Lovehoney Materials:Thermoplastic elastomer (sleeve), polyethylene (case), and polyurethane (lubricant ring at the entrance of the toy) How to Use:Lubricate the inside and entrance of the stroker with a water-based lube, slip it onto your penis, and stroke. Brad Garrison, a registered psychotherapist and relationship issues specialist, recommends this for guys who want a toy that's straightforward and easy to use. \"It’s simple but effective, washable, and inexpensive... A nice starting point for most guys,\" he says. Like the Tenga Egg (more on that below), this toy is designed to be disposable, but can be used up to a few times if you wash and dry it properly between uses. This particular one has a multi-chambered texture on the inside that's meant to mimic the sensations of a deep-throat blowjob. For an even more realistic oral-esque sensation, you can cover up the air hole on one end using your finger, to introduce some suction into each stroke. CalExotics Amazon Materials:Silicone How to Use:Apply water-based lubricant to the inside and rim of the toy before sliding it onto the clitoris. Stroke up and down as desired. Garrison often recommends this toy to his transmasculine clients. It's a stroker that'll work for many trans guys' anatomy. He loves that it's relatively affordable, but notes that it's likely to work best for larger clits, especially those that have experienced growth from being on masculinizing hormones. “Additionally, it is fully reversible—one side is smooth and the other is more textured,” Garrison says, “which allows users to chose the level of stimulation that feels good for them.” Hot Octopuss Amazon Materials: Silicone and ABS plasticBattery Life: About 1 hour How to Use: Apply a water-based lubricant (optionally), place toy against the underside of your penis so it wraps around the shaft and presses against the frenulum, and turn it on. You can hold it in place or stroke it up and down. This vibrator comes highly recommended by Garrison, who says “The Pulse is designed to be slipped over the glans, or end of the penis, and—once things are in place and turned on—is essentially hands-free.” The toy wraps around your shaft, and you can position it so that the vibrations stimulate your sensitive frenulum directly, leaving your hands available for other activities. (Nipple play? Prostate massage? Touching your partner?) Oh, and one other nifty thing about this toy: “It does not require an erection for use,” Garrison says, “making it a great pleasure option for guys who may have difficulty getting or maintaining an erection.” Tenga Amazon Materials: Thermoplastic elastomer How to Use: Remove stroker from the plastic case it comes in. Apply the included lubricant to the inside and entrance of the stroker. Slip the toy onto your penis and stroke as desired. A disposable stroker like this one is a great first foray into the world of sex toys for newbies. I've bought Tenga Eggs for many past partners and they've always been a hit. Made of soft, squishy elastomer, these toys have various different textures on the inside that range from gentle to intense; variety packs are available if you want to try some different options. Their cute egg-shaped packaging makes them travel-friendly, and each one conveniently comes with its own packet of lube tucked inside. Using one of these is a super fun (and cheap!) way to mix up your masturbation technique—or your handjob technique, if (like me) you enjoy using strokers on partners—and, with careful cleaning after each session, you can usually get three to five uses out of each Egg. We-Vibe Lovehoney Materials:SiliconeBattery Life:Up to 2 hours How to Use:Press the main button on the toy to turn it on, and repeat to cycle through the toy’s vibration modes. You can also control it by pairing it with the We-Vibe app. Apply some water-based lube to the inside of the ring before sliding it down to the base of your penis. Position the vibrating part either facing up or facing down so it’ll stimulate your partner’s clitoris or perineum (depending on their anatomy and preferences) during sex. Vibrating cock rings are impressive multitaskers: They beef up your boner by restricting blood flow out of your penis, while the vibration provides pleasure for both you and your partner. I love this one, by We-Vibe, because of how deep and strong the vibrations are; it's fantastic for hands-free clit stimulation during sex. It's also pretty quiet, which allows me to almost forget it's even there and just enjoy the pleasure. One word of warning, though: This cock ring hassomestretch to it, but it may feel too snug around large dicks; it's better suited for those in an average size range. Lovehoney Lovehoney Material:SiliconeSize:Adjustable (fits up to 8.5 inches) How to Use:You won’t need as much lube as you might with a thicker cock ring, but apply a dollop of water-based lube on your flaccid penis, push down on the toggle, and tighten the ring to your liking. Press the toggle once more to loosen. Cock rings can feel intimidating for the uninitiated, and aseamless silicone C-ring—no matter how stretchy—can still feel a bit claustrophobic around a beginner’s penis. Time and time again, I will toss a breezy, adjustable C-ring like this into my bag or back pocket. It’s discreet, and works for pretty much all penis sizes (the max adjustment level is 8.5 inches), and when you’re done using it, the release toggle is just a push away. Blush Novelties Amazon SheVibe Material: SiliconeSize: 1.5-inch diameter How to Use: With a healthy amount of lube, slip onto the base of a flaccid or semi-flaccid penis to help maintain an erection. Our pick for the best basic cock ring is the Performance Pro Silicone Cock Ring: We like this one because it's super affordable and the stretchy, soft silicone material can expand to fit most penis sizes. Plus, its flat design prevents any potential slippage off the shaft. This is a great cock ring for those just looking to dip their toes (or their penises) into the category, but it's also a great choice for experienced cock ring users. We-Vibe Amazon Amazon Pinkcherry Material:SiliconeSize:3.5 inches of insertable length, 1.1 inches of insertable girth, 3.5 inches of girth at the base. Battery life:2 hours How to Use:Apply lubricant to anus and vibrator, then gently insert We-Vibe has been at the forefront of long-distance partner play toys, fromvibrating kegel ballstohigh-tech wands. But all of those frills would feel fruitless if the vibrator in question, the Vector+, wasn’t an absolute banger (luckily, it is). This workhorse is equipped with two motors and 10 settings for a variety of vibration and speed combos, whether you want more rumble towards your balls, the toy’s shaft—you name it, simply adjust the settings on the body of the toy itself, or via the remote control or smartphone app. At 3.5 inches in length and just over 1 inch in girth at its max, this is a solid intermediate toy, but it’s designed to handle even your most raucous smash seshes thanks to the extra-long, extra-secure base. Here’s an idea: Once inserted, rock back and forth while sitting on your butt while your partner blows or strokes you. Ideal Valentine’s Day weekend date! Prisms Amazon Material:Borosilicate glassSize:Small: 4 inches of insertable length, 1.15 inches in diameter|Medium: 4.5 inches of insertable length, 1.35 inches in diameter|Large: 5 inches of insertable length, 1.55 inches in diameter. How to Use:Start off with the smallest plug. Apply the lube of your choice to the plug and your anus, while gently inserting the plug. If and when you would like to graduate to a bigger plug (this can take as much time as you like, be it five minutes or an hour—no set rules here), apply more lube during the swap. Every chef has their set of go-to knives, every carpenter, their trustiest tools. This set of glass anal plugs is one of my most trifectas for sex, whether I’m aiming for some backdoor foreplay or gearing up for full penile penetration. If the concept of glass sex toys sounds counterintuitive, fret not; these borosilicate glass toys are actually farmore body-safe than your run-of-the-mill plastictoys, and will have less friction when entering your anus. The glass also provides a satisfying, slightly weighted sensation in the anus that can stimulate the P-spot. Each of these plugs is a star in its own right, but I find myself using the smallest size the most. At 4-inches of insertable length, it’s more small-medium in my book—but the narrow design makes it great for anal beginners. Lovense Amazon Materials: SiliconeBattery Life: Up to 90 minutes How to Use:Apply water-based lube to the plug and slide it into your anus. Control it via the buttons on the toy or the Lovense app. As someone in a long-distance relationship, I love the way Lovense toys can be controlled from near or far using the Lovense app, which is packed with fun features like video chat and the ability to create your own vibration patterns. This particular plug is one of Lovense's best products, IMO: The angle is adjustable, so this toy can apply exactly as much (or as little) pressure as you want. There are two motors, one on the prostate and one on the perineum, allowing for precise control over your experience. Aneros Amazon Materials:Plastic How to Use:Apply lubricant to the toy before inserting it. \"For guys who are first-timers looking to explore anal play, I would generally recommend a traditional prostate stimulator such the Aneros,\" Garrison says. \"It's compact and easily inserted for newbies, and also includes touch points for perineum stimulation.\" Yep, those little balls on either end of the base actually have a practical purpose: They press into your taint while the plug's inside you, so your prostate gets massaged from the inside and the outside at once. As with many other Aneros toys, this one doesn't vibrate or anything, but is instead made to rub against the prostate whenever you squeeze your sphincter muscles. Many users report reaching explosive hands-free climaxes this way. CalExotics Amazon Materials:Silicone and ABS plasticBattery Life:30-60 minutes How to Use:Press and hold the toy’s button to turn it on or off. Short-press that same button to cycle through the toy’s 12 settings “For guys who are first-timers looking to explore anal play, I would generally recommend a traditional prostate stimulator such the Aneros,” Garrison says. “It's compact and easily inserted for newbies, and also includes touch points for perineum stimulation.” Yep, those little balls on either end of the base actually have a practical purpose: They press into your perineum while the plug's inside you, so (if you have one) your prostate gets massaged from the inside and the outside at once. As with many other Aneros toys, this one doesn't vibrate or anything, but is instead made to rub against the prostate whenever you squeeze your sphincter muscles. Many users report reaching explosive hands-free climaxes this way. Njoy Babeland Amazon Materials: Stainless steel How to Use: Apply lube as needed and insert vaginally or anally. Thrust or rock it in and out however feels best. This elegant metal toy has a lot to offer for both cis and trans guys, says Richards. “For myself and my other vulva-having partners, curved metal wand toys are almost universally a guaranteed orgasm,” he says. “The curved shape stimulates the G-spot and often leads to squirting, while the slick heaviness of the metal itself provides a full feeling of satisfaction.” For men with prostates, this toy can target that zone instead, its curve and firmness allowing it to apply direct, unrelenting pressure. Richards likes that there's a small end and a larger end, so you can experiment with different sensations. We-Vibe Amazon Lovehoney Material:Silicone Size:10.6-inches long, 2.5-inches wide at girthiest pointBattery life:2 hours How to Use:Externally, always, but otherwise there are many possibilities for a wand vibrator for clitoral and anal (again, exterior) stimulation; folks with male anatomy may enjoy sitting on the wand with the tip positioned on the perineum. As it would turn out, the best beginner’s wand vibrator is also one of the most high-tech—but precisely because that tech’s benefits are so effortlessly accessed by the user. We-Vibe’s Wand 2 uses haptic technology, which is just a fancier way of saying that it will respond to pressure from your hand or body with equally-intense vibrations. The result is a very intuitive user experience, as well as an impressively quiet one; as far as wand vibes go, the Wand 2 makes very little noise, and it’s easy to maneuver with one hand thanks to the bendy body. Finally, because this is a We-Vibe toy, its 10 intensity levels and 10 vibration patterns can also be accessed from the app for some long-distance play. Magic Wand Amazon Material:Silicone and ABS plasticBattery life:3 hours How to Use:Press the power button to turn the toy on or off. Use the patterns button to cycle through different vibration modes, and the middle button to ramp up the speed settings. Richards recommends this classic toy, which he considers “the gold standard of vibrators,” for anyone who wants to introduce strong sensations into their sex life, regardless of their gender or anatomy. “If you find [it] a bit intense, using it over underwear is a way to enjoy the buzzing sensation on clits and cocks without excessive direct stimulation,” he suggests. There are various versions of the Magic Wand, including an old-school one that plugs into the wall, but this rechargeable version is more convenient and has more settings than the electric model. Wand Essentials Amazon While the Magic Wand (above) works just fine on its own for penises and vulvas alike, you may as well throw this attachment into your cart along with the wand if you want your (or someone else's) dick to be enveloped in vibration. This inexpensive add-on turns a wand into a vibrating stroker. I love using this toy on partners because of the intensity of the ridged and beaded texture on the inside; it's fun to watch someone react to it as I stroke it up and down with the vibration turned on. THRUST Lovehoney Ah, the classic anatomical stroker. This genre of sex toy will always be GOATed to me, because the realistic design elements make them feel extra kinky and fun, especially if you’re bringing them into partner play (talk about a soft-launch threesome). The 6-inch-long, textured internal chamber of this model is meant to recreate the feeling of realistic vaginal penetration—thus, the name and description—with a tighter chamber than your average stroker at .25 inches in width (most strokers run around.5 inches). Apply ample lube, start off stroking slowly, and enjoy. Fleshy Amazon Gerek vouches that this toy makes for “explosive climaxes” with its combination of sucking, stroking, and vibration. Yes, there's even a “climax button” you can deploy when you're getting close to coming, and the toy will suck you in even deeper, mimicking a deep-throating sensation for an intense finish. It's got a cool space-age aesthetic, too, so it's kinda like getting a blowjob from a robot. Icicles Babeland “For anyone who enjoys backdoor play, it's hard to beat glass butt plugs,”Trip Richards, a sex educator and porn performer, says. \"Glass toys are easy to clean, compatible with all lubricants, and provide a pleasurable sense of fullness and weight.\" They also hold temperature really well, so if you want some especially interesting sensations, dip this plug in a bowl or warm or cold water for a few minutes before using it. The looped handle on this one makes it much easier to insert and remove, even with lubed fingers, and the plug itself is shaped perfectly to nestle into the prostate. There are so many different categories of toys that it can be tough to know what’s what. Here’s a breakdown of the major types of male sex toys available for people with penises and prostates to enjoy. We tried out as many toys as we could, but we also wanted some input from sexperts so that they could share their recommendations for you. Here's who gave us a hand in compiling our picks.",

    "title": "10 Best Products for Healthy Beard Growth",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Maintaining abeard—or any kind of facial hair—takes more than just letting it grow wild and crossing your fingers. The best products for healthy beard growth help keep your scruff tamed and, well, healthy. But before you commit to a mustache, goatee, lumberjack scruff, or even that dangerously sexy five o’clock shadow, let’s take a step back. Facial hair needs a solid foundation—meaning clean, happy skin—for it to grow to its full potential. Personally, I live somewhere between a stubble and a struggle beard (still waiting on that full-fill magic), mostly because I avoidshavingtoo often to give my skin a break. That said, a neck line-up is non-negotiable to keep some distinction between my face and neck. What keeps my face ready to rock—no matter what ‘90sfacial hair inspois on my mood board (looking at you, Keanu and D'Angelo)—are my cabinet must-haves:moisturizers,scrubs,face wash,sunscreen, andserums. These aren't just for skin care nerds; they’re secret weapons for follicle finesse. Here’s why they matter: Scrubs (physical exfoliants) remove dead skin and unclog pores, preventingingrown hairsand boosting circulation to hair follicles—a.k.a. prime growth conditions. Cleansers sweep away oil, dirt, and bacteria so your follicles aren’t suffocating under yesterday’s grime. Moisturizers keep your skin hydrated and flake-free, protecting that precious skin barrier and reducing breakage in new hairs. SPF is non-negotiable—sun damage isn’t just bad for your skin; it can also mess with your beard game by inflaming follicles or making skin less elastic. Serums deliver targeted ingredients like peptides, niacinamide, or biotin straight to your skin, giving follicles the boost they need to stay strong and sprout-worthy. Chemical exfoliants (AHAs/BHAs) gently resurface your skin, clear out buildup, and reduce acne, sort of like Marie Kondo-ing your face for optimal growth. So, whether you’re chasing that full-beard glory or just trying to make your current situation less patchy, these products give you the clean foundation you need to let your facial hair thrive. Moonbow Skin Moonbow Skin After cleansing and before moisturizing, youdefinitelywant to slot in a serum. It improves texture, evens out tone, and with regular use, gives you that smoother, brighter, hydrating kind of skin. Lately, I’ve been reaching for a serum fromMoonbow, a new kid on the skin care block that launched earlier this year—and yes, they've already earned real estate on my bathroom shelf. Its hero ingredient? Chrysanthemum—an herb that shows up both in the serumandin a sachet of tea that comes with every order. Yep, you get to sip while you slather. I usually go with two drops, pat it into my face, and follow up with a little neck action—because if you’re skipping your neck, you’re only doing half the job. The serum spreads easily and is technically fragrance-free, but it still smells amazing thanks to natural orange peel extract (not synthetic, thank you very much). It brightens my skin and leaves a radiant—not greasy—finish, making it the perfect partner for a final layer of moisturizer. Malin+Goetz Malin+Goetz Finding a good moisturizer is usually a saga for me. First, I don't want it tobreak me out. Second, if it’s too light, I end up with a flaky nose by noon and have to sneak off to reapply. That’s not the case with Malin+Goetz. I use about a quarter-sized dollop of their face lotion, rub it in like I actually know what I’m doing, and boom—my skin stays moisturized all day. No midday lotion panic or no dry patches. It's fragrance-free (huge win), and packed with vitamin E to protect from environmental damage while keeping your skin soft and smooth. There's chamomile extract to calm irritation—perfect for redness or post-shave regret—and sodium hyaluronate, a hydration magnet that plumps and softens skin. I usually don’t trust anything labeled “lightweight,” since I need performance, not marketing buzzwords, but this one actually lives up to the hype. It’s gentle enough to use morning and night—and tough enough to handle my face's unpredictable climate. Wonder Valley Wonder Valley An olive oil brand that also makes killer skin care? That’s the California-based Wonder Valley in a nutshell. Their cleanser has officially dethroned my olddrugstorestandby—and I don’t see myself going back. Unlike the usual foamy suspects, this one has a honey-like consistency that, when mixed with water, transforms into a luxurious milky emulsion, all thanks to oat protein. One pump goes a long way—it spreads like a dream—and leaves your skin feeling soft, smooth, andnotlike you just used sandpaper. It’s packed with good stuff, too: sea buckthorn (extra vitamin E) nourishes, grape seed helps regulate oil production, and the star of the show, olive oil, brings antioxidant-rich emollience that improves texture and tone. Sure, it’s a bit pricier than your average cleanser, but the honey-to-milk magic means it lasts for months—and your face will thank you every time. Nécessaire Nécessaire Sunscreenis always one of the first things you pack for the beach, but somehow one of the last things (if not completely forgotten) in yourdaily skin care routine. Guilty as charged. Nécessaire’s sunscreen is here to fix that. It’s made for your face and body, with a lightweight, lotion-like texture that blends more smoothly than most zinc-based SPFs. It protects against both UVA and UVB rays and uses non-nano zinc oxide (20%) as its active ingredient—a physical blocker that’s ideal for sensitive skin. It’s fragrance-free and loaded with hydrating ingredients like niacinamide, panthenol (B5), and glycerin to help support your skin barrier and fight off dryness. Honestly, this is one of those buy two situations: one for your bathroom cabinet and one for your beach tote—because forgetting it is no longer an option. (Your future self will thank you.) Ursa Major Ursa Major Vermont-based label Ursa Major remains one of my favoriteskin care brands, and theirshaving creamis something I’ll never stop raving about. But let’s talk about this mineral finish face exfoliant: It’s a game-changer. Whether you’ve got a smooth baby face, some scruff, or a full-on beard, this stuff revives your mug like a splash of mountain spring water. It uses finely ground volcanic rock and bamboo powder to exfoliate—sounds intense, but it’s surprisingly gentle. It sloughs off dead skin cells and grime without scratching you up. The smell? A fresh, no-fake-stuff blend of cedar, spearmint, and rosemary that smells like an alpine spa but won’t punch you in the nose. It’s especially great for sensitive skin (I speak from experience), thanks to soothing sunflower seed oil that hydrates and calms. Just don’t overdo it—this is a two to three times a week kind of ritual. Bonus tip: Let it sit for a few as a mask while watching the NBA playoffs or right before a shave. Your face will thank you. Doré Doré I remember reading Garance Doré’s fashion blog back in high school and thinking,Wow, so this is what effortless French chic looks like.It made perfect sense when she co-founded a tasteful French skin care label—fittingly calledDoré—in 2022 with Emily Yeston. The brand embraces a “less is more” philosophy, offering fewer products but crafted with a focus on higher quality. Their Le Sérum is lightweight, super hydrating, and glides on like a charm. Its star ingredients include Kakadu plum fruit (nature’s most extra source of vitamin C), linseed for elasticity, and meadowfoam to help strengthen and plump your skin. It’s made for every face and skin type—so basically, you’re good to go. Tower 28 Tower 28 In your skin care arsenal, a hydrating spray should be as essential—and as close by—as your trusty water tumbler. Just like you sip throughout the day to keep your body happy, your skin craves the same kind of refreshment. Enter: Tower28’s SOS Spray. I can't recommend this stuff enough, especially if you're the type who needs a mid-day pick-me-up (or spritz-me-up?). Powered by hypochlorous acid, this daily toner treatment is like an Avenger in a spray bottle. It’s anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and works overtime to calm your skin, support your barrier, and prevent flare-ups like a champ. Use it morning and night as the final flourish after cleansing and moisturizing. Or, go wild—mist it onto a bare face, over moisturizer, under sunscreen, or whenever your skin starts sending out a dehydrated SOS of its own. This one’s a lifesaver in mist form. Typology Typology Minimalist French skin care label Typology is only six years old, and yet they’ve already become one of our go-tobeauty brands. Besides the fact that their products actuallywork, they’re also refreshingly easy to understand, thanks to short, readable ingredient lists. The brand's newly reformulated face moisturizer keeps skin hydrated for up to eight hourswithoutleaving your face greasy or sticky. The key ingredients? Hyaluronic acid is beloved for its ability to attract and hold water. Shea olein, a lighter fraction of shea butter that absorbs faster but still delivers those rich, nourishing, skin-repairing benefits. Plum oil, which is rich in fatty acids naturally found in your skin’s hydrolipidic film, helps reinforce your skin barrier and reduce water loss—which sounds technical, but basically means no more dry, flaky situations. A little goes a long way, and it's especially great for folks with super-dry skin (hi, it’s me). Also, it's non-comedogenic, a fancy skin care word worth learning because it means it won’t clog your pores and will be your new best friend if you're acne-prone or sensitive. Aesop Aesop To really get the dirt and grime off your face (and yes, there’s more than you think), sometimes you need a scrub with a little more muscle. Aesop’s facial scrub fits the bill. It’s gentlebuteffective, made with finely milled quartz—it’s got just enough grit to exfoliate without feeling like sandpaper. There’s also lactic acid, a mild alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) that loosens dead skin cells and smooths out your texture. The fragrance? Earthy and herbaceous, with notes of rosemary and chamomile. Ideal for once-a-week use—or more often if you’re shaving regularly. And if you’re using it pre-shave (smart move), follow up withAesop’s post-shave creamfor the total, clean-slate experience. Le Labo Nordstrom Given that Le Labo makes some of the bestcolognesandcandlesout there, it’s no shocker that it's also whipped up one of the best facial scrubs. Like other top-tier scrubs, it’s built on a blend of volcanic ash, seaweed, and ginger extracts—exfoliating without stripping your face down. The citrusy, vegetal aroma (basil meets verbena) makes youwantto use it daily, but easy there, overachiever—this is a once or twice-a-week kind of rendezvous. Your pores need time to miss it.",

    "title": "Justin Bieber Had Wild Seats and an Even Wilder Fit to Watch the Maple Leafs Lose Game 7",
    "article_text": "It happened again. On Sunday, theToronto Maple Leafslost another Game 7—something hockey fans can basically set their watch to every spring—this time in supremely demoralizing fashion, getting thoroughly dominated at home by theFlorida Panthers. But beyond the events that took place on the ice, there was another expected-but-notable occurrence on Sunday night in the 6ix:Justin Bieberwore an especially conspicuous outfit. With a massive, salmon-toned jacket from the Utah menswear label Bad Son, a fuzzy, Russian-style hat, and dark sunglasses, Bieber stood out amid the droves of blue sweaters. Seated right behind the Maple Leafs bench withhis wife Hailey—who opted for a vintage Leafs Starter jacket for her own tunnel fit,soundtracked by a Skrillex song on her husband’s Instagram—the couple had a rinkside vantage point for the 6-1 loss. Unlike in the NBA playoffs, though,where celebrity rowis typically highlighted within the first few moments of the broadcast, the Biebers flew slightly under the radar on the TNT broadcast. It wasn’t until later in the game, with the Panthers’ onslaught well underway, that the camera panned to the diehard Leafs fan and his funky hat. By then, any strands of positive energy had left the building and the familiarhere we go againdoom loomed over the arena like theCN Tower. With Sunday’s embarrassment, the Leafs have now lost seven straight Game 7s, this one coming after they had a 2-0 lead in the series. The last time they left a Game 7 with a win was in the first round of the2004 playoffsagainst the Ottawa Senators, when Justin Bieber was 10 years old. A win on Sunday would have sent the embattled franchise to its first Conference Finals since 2002, but instead they were bounced by a Florida team that looked like they simply wanted it more. The Leafs have made the postseason nine years in a row and bowed out in the first or second round every single time. You can understand, then, why Bieber looked like he wanted to crawl into a hole once Florida really started pouring it on. (The game was tied after one period, but the Panthers scored three times in the second, and when Toronto finally got on the board in the third, Florida answered with a goal of their own just 47 seconds later.) At one point, the London,Ontario kiddecided to retreat into his big jacket rather than keep watching. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. While it was surely an emotionally wretching night for Bieber—whoskipped the Met Gala earlier this month to watch his squad—there was some undeniable comedy in seeing him vibrantly peacocking behind the bench while the Leafs were drowned by Florida’s relentless attack. Even funnier was organically realizing that the guy rocking indoor shades and aJamiroquai ensemblein the expensive seats was one of the most famous people in the world before the broadcast acknowledged him. To his credit, Bieber posted through it, calling himself a “slut for these boys,” whose Stanley Cup drought began in 1967. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. TheCanadian pop starmade another grid post after the game, showing off his baggy jeans, shoelace belt, and unwavering devotion to his favorite team. “I don’t remember a time in my life when I haven’t been obsessed with the leafsssss,” he captioned a 16-photo carousel. “This year we made it farther than we have in so long and im happy about that…I can be patient cuz I know this is the team to do it.” This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Whether next year is the one where the Leafs finally get over the 58-year hump—the longest anyNHLorganization has ever gone without a championship—we can all but guarantee Bieber’s presence, perhaps in an even bigger fit.",

    "title": "The Real-Life Diet of Matteo Lane, Who Has Advice on Hair Transplants",
    "article_text": "Matteo Lane knows firsthand how hard it can be to maintain a healthy physiqueon the road. The 38-year-old comedian—whose hourlong specialMatteo Lane: The Al Dente Special, just premiered on Hulu—travels the country slinging jokes for a living. That means tons of meals on the go, dingy comedy clubs with subpar kitchens, andlate nights in random hotels. While many associate this lifestyle with copious amounts of alcohol, Lane is not much of a drinker. Instead of tequila, he asks for lean protein and veggies on his rider for every show, and prefers to only work on the weekends so he can stick to hisexercise schedule. When talking through his fitness journey—Lane is one of the more visibly jacked performers on the comedy circuit right now—he recalls his quarterly pilgrimages to Italy for carbonara and digestivos and deciding to finally pull the trigger on a hair transplant. Matteo Lane:Probably. I’ve been working out. My sister is anIFBBPro. She started when I was in my early 20s, and so I started working out in my late 20s. She taught me everything, like the basic structure of someone who wants to work out and who wants to eat healthy. That life, she basically set me up with that. She had to, because she's my sister. Right now, I weigh 169 pounds. But when I moved to New York at 25, I weighed 128 pounds. I was very thin. I wasn't anorexic or anything. I just did not understand diet, food, working out. So, it's been years of me being at the gym and working on that. I would say I have a pretty solid understanding. No, she wasn’t. No one was worried. It was just an insecurity thing. I was at the Funny Bone inDayton, Ohioand I had just bombed. This is before I could sell tickets. I was backstage and I was tired. A lot of people talk about body shaming when people are overweight. People don't talk about body shaming when you're wildly underweight, which I know sounds really—it's a conversation that people are uncomfortable with. I totally understand, because being thin is usually “the ideal body,” but I wanted to feel attractive. I wanted to feel muscular. I wanted to feel comfortable in clothes that I bought. I wanted all the things that everybody wants. I just didn't have any knowledge on how to do it. I was always made fun of for my chicken legs, always made fun of for being too skinny. I was always made fun of just generally. I remember one guy said to me—I was at a bar, this is in my 20s—and we were chatting. He goes, “I'm just going to let you know, I would sleep with you if you gained at least 15 pounds of muscle.” I was like, damn, okay. By the way, I never had a problem with my body! It wasn't like I was self-hating, but I want to age gracefully and maturely. I like being in shape and I like working out. I just didn't know how to do it, because you walk into a gym and it just looks like a bunch of medieval torture devices and no one's there to tell you what to do or how to do it. I think people are so intimidated by the gym, rightfully so. The people intimidate me. I'm not aggressive like that. I didn't playsports, so I didn't have a fundamental foundation of how to work out or how to eat. You just walk in and you just feel like a loser, like I was going to get called f----t again. Then you realize after just a single week of going to the gym, no one cares about you! These people are on theirlunch break, they're just trying to get a workout in. Someone has a new diet plan, someone just had a kid and they're trying to get back. No one fucking cares about you. Focus on what you need to do. Lane shows off his arms on a 2023 red carpet. And also, everybody has different goals at the gym. Not everyone's goal at the gym is to come out looking like Arnold Schwarzenegger. Some people have goals like, I really want to get into cardio, I really want to work with calisthenics, I really want to be more flexible, I really want to get into cycling, I really like running, I want to do dance classes. Some people go because it's just a way to express themselves! It's a way to get out energy after a long week. It's a way to feel better, to build confidence. It sucks because these trainers you see online are always so... it's like they're always yelling at you. I don't understand. They're always like,Today is the day where you make your choice. It's just not that serious. Well, as a comic, I'm inherently opposed to anyone super positive about anything. But I also would say to people that go to the gym—you see these people go to the gym and day one, they're just doing everything. They're going insane, and then day two and day three, they're going back at it. By day five, they're exhausted. Of course, then they think,Well, I can't go to the gym because I'm exhausted. Yeah, the gym doesn't have to be that! The gym can be a slow build-up. I did just my arms today and a little bit of cardio. It was 45 minutes. I listened toJanet Jackson. Let’s see what we can do tomorrow. Just slowly work yourself up. When you go to the gym, number one, have a goal. Number two, don’t exhaust yourself. Number three, have a long-term plan. No, honestly. I don’t drink. I drink a margarita once every three months. I was inMexicolast week with friends, so, okay, twice I had a margarita. That's it for me. I don't do drugs. I'm pretty boring in that sense. To be able to have a healthy diet, try to get enough sleep, and feel good about yourself at the gym, it helps you on these exhausting tours. It's exhausting to tour and it's exhausting to constantly give out energy. So, it's good to go to the gym. Now when I go to the gym, it’s like,ahhh. I don't have to do anything but worry about my legs for the next hour. I don't have to answer to an agent. I don't have to answer to my manager. I don't have to worry about performing. I don't have to write a joke. It's a kind of clarity that helps you in the midst of all the insanity. They say you get your best ideas in the shower. It's because the shower white-noises out anything else, and you can let your mind wander. Any way you can let your mind just wander around is always a good way of bringing in thoughts, especially for me. When I'm joke writing, I don't know that I can do it that well when I'm running through an airport, but I can if I'm just letting my mind go off. My trainer, Andrew Kusovschi, I found online and he is fantastic. He has me on a program. Today was upper body. He has me doing abunch of stretches, obviously, before. I have to do some rowing, which sometimes I skip because I'm lazy. I did a barbell bench press. I have to do three sets. Then I had to do the chest press machine, three sets. I had to do dumbbell lateral raise, three sets. Machine assist, close grip pull up. They're all three sets. Chest-supported T-bar row, single arm tricep pull-down. Then at the end I have to do some stretches as well, and mark in the app how much I lifted versus last week. He changes it up every four weeks. Right now, because I'm prepping my body for new types of workouts and to go heavier, he has me split my body Monday to Friday. So it's day one, lower A, is what he calls it. Day two, upper A. Wednesday, cardio and abs. Thursday, lower B. Friday, upper B. He's splitting upper and lower body throughout the week, different workouts, and it's mainly lifting. I do a little bit of cardio. I also live in New York, so I walk literally everywhere. But it's a lot of lifting weights, and that's what I like doing the best. No. I just like to slowly progress, as long as my body feels good and I feel like I'm pushing myself a bit. But a lot of this is also diet. He's written out my diet and then sends it to me through a company called MegaFit Meals. I have my whole diet laid out: what I have to eat on leg day versus what I have to eat on upper body day, and how many carbs I am taking on this day, and then balancing out how much weight I've gained. It's pretty boring. It's a lot ofchicken and rice, a lot of beef and sweet potatoes, a lot of yogurt, oatmeal, protein powder, banana and peanut butter smoothies, stuff like that. It's pretty boring. Yeah. But I like it. I like having rules and I like routine and I like structure. I don't like feeling out of control. But then when I went to Mexico for a week, it's like, well, fuck it. I'm going to eat all the tacos, I'm going to have pancakes for breakfast, I'm going to have a margarita. For me, that's going crazy. Then the week comes back and my body—because I work out so much and I eat so strictly—my body is ready to jump back in. When I go to Italy for two weeks, I'm like, I don't think I should be having carbonara twice a day. I do do it! I keep getting carbonara. It’s a problem. The longest I lived in Italy was in college when I was a foreign exchange student in Umbria for four months or something. Then last month I went to my cousin's house in Sicily. But I'm in Italy often, at least four times a year. Italians, the percentage of people whose body weight is considered overweight is far lower. They're not as obsessed with working out and building muscle the same way that we are, but they are obsessed about diet and they are obsessed about digestion. Katie Parla, who’s a good friend of mine and a great author, taught me about the Italian concerns of the digestive system. Americans want everything now, all on their plate. They eat everything at once, and then they feel like shit. With the Italians, dinner moves very differently. First maybe you have your antipasti, whether that's some cured meats, whether that's a salad, whether that's some fruit, whatever. Then you have your primo, which is your pasta, and the pasta is not grown with a bunch of chemicals. It's cooked properly, it's the right proportions. They don't use cream, they don't use tons of butter. It's completely different. And then if you're still hungry, you can have your secondo, which is a meat. They don't have a lot of chicken in Italy, to be honest with you, but you have your meat. Then afterwards, if you want a dessert, maybe some fruit, maybe an espresso. Then they have Amaro, which is a digestivo. You take a shot to help your body process it, prepare for the next thing. It's not all shoved in at once. Then they do something called passeggiato.Everybody now walks. They all walk through the city, a big long walk. Everyone's walking through the city and going to the piazza. The idea of food in Italy versus America—you watch somebody at lunch in America in Midtown, they run to get a salad. Essentially they're doing cocaine as a salad. They eat it as quick as they can and go back to work. The Italians take two hours and they eat their meal. Now, obviously their economy sucks, but they live longer and they have a better life. What's more important to you? Americans look at food as energy, Italians look at food as culture. Look, they drink too much coffee, they smoke too many cigarettes. They havewine with dinner every night, but they figured it out. Obviously you go to Sicily, people are still eating ice cream cones from a fucking truck. It's fine. It's a culture that's been around longer. That's just how they've been doing it. Maybe work a little more? Do we need three-hour lunches? I don't know about that. How they drive seems insane. Coffee rules are very specific. Italian culture is a culture that battles with itself constantly about tradition and about moving forward, and has a hard time moving forward. I think it's a really difficult place for you to grow because so many people are combative and do things based off tradition. Whereas America is a country based off an idea. It's about growing and competitiveness andwhat's the new thing?But we also don't wake up next to a 2,000-year-old structure. We think that we are the only ones right now and this is the only thing happening. Look, I’m not dissing America. New York is one of the best if notthebest city in the world. I could never have made it as a gay comic in any other city besides New York. The amount of opportunity, the amount of expression, the amount of artists, the amount of creativity, the amount of drive. New York is a really important place. It's not a passive city. It's not a city you can live in passively unless your parents are very rich. I love, love living in New York City, so I'm not knocking America food-wise. I [just] think that we could pick up a lot from other countries. I would never put my face in an ice bowl. I'd just get Botox. Also, I'm not into these Instagram trends—these fitness people that film themselves waking up as if there was already a camera there. They're just shittily acting their morning routine. My morning routine is I look at my phone for 40 minutes and then I stroll out of bed and make myself a cappuccino and watch video game news. I'm not that serious about it. I'm not good withkettlebells. I can't use them. I don't have rhythm. I can't dance. When I try and use kettlebells, I always look like a fucking idiot. I don't like workout classes because I don't like the excitement of the trainer. I am a comedian. In my head, I'm like,Oh, they hate all of us. It requires a certain amount of energy and professionalism to be that trainer, but I'm just cynical because I'm a comic. It's similar to improv. I can't do improv. I don't like that energy. No. I usually tour on the weekends, which takes longer. The benefit is I don’t have to sleep on a bus and be out for three months doing shows every night. I get sick of my own material. I need some space from it. Number two, I like living in New York. I leave on the weekends and come back on the weekdays. On the weekdays, I try to work out, which I structure with Andrew. But I do worry about my diet. I really try to order chicken and rice, or get yogurt, keep it a little lighter. It's really hard. I now have chicken, rice, and steamed vegetables in my rider. It is, yeah.When I was 25 and I was on the road, it was very different. I wasn't performing in big, beautiful theaters. I was in really shitty clubs and getting paid nothing and sleeping in comedy condos. You ate what you could get. It just depends on where you're at. Right now, I'm lucky enough to stay in nice hotels and do really nice shows. That changes how I eat. I’m getting a third one this summer. Yeah, I was balding and I wanted hair! I was insecure about it, sick of not putting my head under a pool, afraid of windy days, so I promised myself when I made it I would get myself a hair transplant. So, 17 years of doingstandup comedyand being poor and borrowing money from my agent, not eating—I finally started selling tickets! That first big paycheck, I went right to Dr. Carlos Wesley and said, \"Give me hair.\" No, I wanted to recover and be ugly at home. I did a lot of research. You really want a focus. Also, a natural hairline. Your hairs are in groups of three, twos and ones. At the front of your hairline, it should be ones, and then you go back and then it's two, and then it's three. That way, you don't look like a fucking Cabbage Patch Kid with your fucking hairline. It's more expensive to do it in the States, so I understand why people go to Turkey or Brazil, but it's harder when you go to those places because it's a bit of a factory. You don't know what the hair care is going to be like. You don't know what your recovery is going to be like. You really have to do your research and make sure you're seeing a clinic and a doctor that knows what they're doing. If it's in another country, talk to other people or read reviews to see what the process is like, because it can still be dangerous. They filled my beard in a bit, because I had no hair there. I'm doing a third time just to finish the empty patch on the back of my head. My friend Chris and I are replaying all the X-Men Legendgames. The GameCube is a great system and it’s wildly underrated. It wasn’t a successful system, but it was fun. They’ll survive past the apocalypse. InReal-Life Diet,athletes, celebrities, and other high performers talk about their diet, exercise routines, and pursuit of wellness. Keep in mind that what works for them might not necessarily be healthy for you.",

    "title": "Is ‘Run Fast, Squat Heavy’ the Ultimate Compromise Between Cardio and Strength Training?",
    "article_text": "This story is from Manual,GQ’s flagship newsletter offering useful advice on style, health, and more, four days a week.Sign up here to get it in your inbox. A few years ago, longtime CrossFit athleteAdam Klinkset a certain corner of the internet ablaze when he ran a sub-five-minute mile and hit a 500-pound back squat in the same day. Either of those numbers could be a personal record of a very fit person, but to Klink, it was the combination that exemplified the CrossFit philosophy. “It’s that mindset of not being amazing at one thing but good at everything,” he tellsGQ. What began as a personal quest caught on, and Klinkpublished his training planto create the 10-week Run Fast, Squat Heavy program, which has since captured the attention of runners, lifters, and the “hybrid” athletes who do both. Perhaps the reason Klink’s accomplishment so captivated the fitness world was because running fast and squatting heavy are largely seen as incompatible. And in some ways, they are. Lifting heavy weights builds fast-twitch muscle fibers, which power short bursts of energy and fatigue quickly, saysN’namdi Nelson, an exercise physiologist at NYU Langone’s Sports Performance Center. If you focus on building that capacity, you run the risk of ignoring the slow-twitch muscles that power endurance efforts. “It’s like a seesaw,” Nelson says. “As you get stronger, it’s going to be difficult to also keep the endurance up.” Difficult, but as Klink proved, not impossible. Want to try running fast and squatting heavy? Here’s what experts say about who the program is right for, and what you should know before you start. Before you try to run fast and squat heavytogether, you should ideally be able to run relatively fast and squat relatively heavyseparately.Casey Johnston, who writes theShe’s a Beastnewsletter, and who tried Run Fast, Squat Heavy last year, suggests that if you’re new to either running or lifting (or both), you take time to build proficiency and conditioning before attempting a program like this. There’s a beautiful symmetry to Klink’s goal of a sub-five-minute mile and a 500-pound squat. But those numbers will be out of reach for most, and Klink says that his program is intended for athletes to set their own goal based on a one-mile time trial and a current one-rep max. Figuring out just how much those numbers will progress in 10 weeks isn’t always straightforward, so Nelson recommends recruiting a coach to help. And when in doubt, aim conservative. Klink says the biggest challenge of the training plan was avoiding injury. He credits his success to recovering well during training: He stretched daily, used recovery boots, tooks cold baths, and soaked in Epsom salts. Following the warm-ups and cool-downs prescribed in the program is also key, he says, as is prioritizing sleep and nutrition. Exercise physiologist and trainerTom Hollandsuggests keeping an eye out for symptoms of overtraining, such as inability to sleep, irritability, an elevated resting heart rate, and being overly sore. Yes, it’s possible to run fast and squat heavy on the same day. But will it be thefastestmile, or theheaviestsquat you’re capable of? Probably not. “If I were solely focused on squatting, I would have been able to jump my back squat numbers even more,” says Klink. “If I focused on running and not back squatting, could I have run faster? Absolutely. But you can slowly raise the level of both at the same time if you train them properly.” “There’s lots of stuff on social media that says lifting weights is going to make you bulky and muscle-bound and slow,” saysAlan Thrall, strength training coach and founder of Untamed Strength, who tried the challenge with deadlifts rather than squats. “And the other camp says strength is most important, and you don’t need cardio because it will kill your gains. Now people are coming around to the idea that youcan—and probably should—do both.” But you don’t need to be sprinting around the track or doing one rep max attempts to reap the benefits of having a balance of cardio and strength training in your routine. In fact, forrunning coach Eric Orton, the risks of lifting as heavy as you can override the benefits when it comes to overall well-being. “You have to see [Run Fast, Squat Heavy] as a sport,” he says. “Not something that’s good for you.” So Run Fast, Squat Heavy is intense. It isn’t for everyone. But it might be fun. And if it doesn’t sound fun? “You can be a very well-rounded athlete without trying to set PRs in either of these things,” says Johnston.",

    "title": "Sure, You're Drinking Apple Cider Vinegar. But Is It Actually Good For You?",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. There's an abundance of weird food hacks out there. Eat an apple if you've got bad breath. Rub strawberries on your teeth if you want them whiter. Rinse your hair with lemon juice for a quick fix to dull hair. Or drink apple cider vinegar for better skin and better health. With many of these fads being quickly debunked as nothing but quasi-health garbage, it'd be easy to condemn the drinking of apple cider vinegar, too. Go on TikTok and you'll likely be served a short video of a self-declared health guru boasting the benefits of downing it like a shot of tequila. Some people have begun to take it ingummyform. But does drinking apple cider vinegar actually work? We decided to get to the core of it. “The big thing is that it helps with acid reflux,” says Andy Daly, nutritional therapy practitioner at Dr. David Jack and member of the British Association for Nutrition and Lifestyle Medicine, who has been drinking apple cider vinegar everyday day since the 1980s. She's referring to the hellish condition of ‘heartburn’. The high pH intensity of the vinegar can neutralize stomach acid, bringing balance to the levels of acid, and preventing it from flowing back up, which is the root course of acid reflux. A 12-week clinical trial conducted by Tehran's Shahid Beheshti University found that those regularly taking apple cider vinegar had significantly reduced body weight, BMI and visceral adiposity index (a smart way to measure the accumulation and effects of internal fat). Furthermore, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration—the good cholesterol that lowers the risk of heart attacks—significantly increased. “Also, in my house, we have it the minute anyone feels sick or has a hint of a sore throat. We have one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar diluted in water three times a day and usually it clears up any ailments,\" Daly says. Rhian Stephenson, nutritionist, ex-CEO of Psycle and founder of supplements brandArtah Health, has felt the effects herself and fully supports a daily dose of apple cider vinegar. “Personally, I find that it helps with my digestion and bloody sugar control, especially when I'm overtired. Apple cider vinegar isn't a magic bullet, but it does have proven benefits when it comes to blood sugar regulation, postprandial insulin response, appetite and satiety, and potentially, managing cholesterol levels.\" A2020 US studyfound that, yes, apple cider vinegar could help regulate blood glucose concentrations and be of help to those with type two diabetes. Andfurther researchfound links between apple cider vinegar intake and reduced cholesterol—but take note: that was just a small study, and there's more testing to be done. \"Other studies have shown that apple cider vinegar increases the subjective rating of satiety; meaning, the participants who had the vinegar before the meal reported feeling more satisfied and 'fuller' afterwards. It's also thought to help with digestion: ACV will help acidify the lumen of the stomach, which is an important aspect of digestion.” A study conducted by Athens University in 2014 found that those who consumed vinegar before eating a meal had lower insulin and triglyceride levels after the meal than those who didn't. Gut and skin health sort of go hand-in-hand. Researchers and dermatologists have found that when your gut health is off-center, then the balance of your microbiome also takes a hit, which results in breakouts and unevenness in tone. That said, simply taking shots of apple cider vinegar might notactuallydo much for your skin, as some TikTokers believe. “I'm a big believer that a healthier gut is linked to the health of your skin, but one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar three times a day with a glass of water is not going to help what your dermis is doing, sadly,” says Daly. “A lot of gut issues are caused because of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), which is when the stomach acid is not strong enough. This is because you have an overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine that feed on undigested food particles. Apple cider vinegar alone can't help with that, and so you need to deal with that first in order to then see benefits in the skin and elsewhere.\" Yep, you're right in thinking it's the stuff that you might already have in the kitchen cupboard, ready to drizzle on a fairly dull salad. Apple cider vinegar is made through a simple fermenting process and it's by no means a new thing, even if TikTok and Gwyneth Paltrow only discovered it in the past five years. It's actually been around for a long time, being used in ancient civilizations such as Egypt, Babylonia, Greece and the Roman Empire, while Hippocrates, the founding father of Greek medicine, recommended his patients drink it for quicker healing. The fermentation process essentially turns apple juice, using yeast and bacteria, into acetic acid (a byproduct of fermentation, which gives apple cider vinegar its signature sharp scent). And that's the stuff that people are downing in shot glasses each and every morning. “When looking to buy an apple cider vinegar, you need to get one that has ‘the mother’ in it,\" says Daly, by which she refers to the build-up of bacteria and yeast you'll see floating in some apple cider vinegars. “It's very important if you want the benefits of apple cider vinegar. Then you know that you're getting the fermented goodness, like Bragg's.\" “You don't want to down it like a shot straight from the bottle on a regular basis,” Daly says “It's extremely acidic and over time this will actually do damage to the enamel on your teeth.” Instead, as Daly has done for many years, you should dilute concentrated vinegar from the bottle with half a cup of water and drink it that way. “It's actually a lot more palatable that way too, as let's face it: drinking vinegar isn't nice.\" “I take raw, organic apple cider vinegar, pretty much daily and have done for years,\" says Stephenson. “I also use it for dressings and salsas; it's a nice way to include a functional food with proven health benefits to everyday meal prep.” “I tend to recommend it for people who are struggling to get a hold of blood sugar and appetite, as well as individuals who suffer from bloating with meals,” says Stephenson. “It's also a common biohacking tool when you know you'll be eating something that's higher in starch or sugar; combining a pre-meal dose of apple cider vinegar with a post-meal walk can make an enormous difference in postprandial glucose levels. We include it in our nutrition plans, likeThe Metabolic Reset, and as a functional food in many of the dressings in our program recipes.” “Some people say it could interact with some medications, especially those used to treat diabetes. The medicine Metformin, which is used to treat type two diabetes, in particular,” Daly says. “If somebody was to come to me, I always want to know what medications they're on. And then I look at drug-nutrient interactions. So if anyone is on medication, I would suggest they consult an official health practitioner before starting to take apple cider vinegar. “Importantly, if you've got a bacterial infection in the small intestine—or SIBO as it's medically known—and you're on a specific protocol of medication or a strict diet, you can't have anything fermented because that encourages the growth of these bacteria. So apple cider vinegar should definitely be avoided.” “I wouldn't take those,” Daly says. “In order to get the benefits of apple cider vinegar, with the mother, you need to take the actual stuff and you're not going to get that in gummies.” “I haven't seen any indication that a gummy with added sugar and preservatives would have the same effect,” says Stephenson. \"Also, there's the obvious link with blood sugar; if you're struggling with cravings, blood sugar control, and appetite, eating a sweetened gummy is unlikely to be supportive and can reinforce your taste and cravings for sweets. “I've also found that the ritual of actually drinking apple cider vinegar for people is hugely beneficial; they usually increase their water intake, and generally become more mindful of what they're putting into their body. If you're doing something on a daily basis that is super easy and effective, it's easier to build on this momentum and add in other foods, practices or habits that are beneficial.” This story originally ran onBritish GQ.",

The platonic ideal of anairport fit: elegant blazer, roomy trousers, comfy tee, and a convenient pair of loafers to slip on and off in the TSA line. How do you finish off apattern-happy, no-holds-barred, dandyish-to-the-max Met Gala look? With a swanky pair of kiltie loafers, of course. Paul Mescal, a self-described “big advocate for men wearing shorter shorts,” proves here that there's no better match for said shorts than a killer pair of loafers. Meet your new office uniform: crisp dress shirt, solidknit vest, perfectlytailored trousers,ribbed socks, loafers. Gucci's horsebit loafers get all the headlines, but don't sleep on the house'sotherindelible styles—particularly the '70s-inflected, red-and-green-striped joints modeled here by curator extraordinaire (and occasionalGQ contributor) Sargent. Black-tie shorts are a galactic-level swerve, but P's chic studded loafers help lock things down nicely. OK, let us now pay our proper respects to one of the most prominent and prodigious loafer wearers of our time: Tyler, the Creator. Here he is in his go-to Doc Martens withwashed denimand a sick Fair Isle knit… …and again with crispwork pantsand apastel puffer… …and one more time withbaggy shortsand a rowdysweater vest. Over the past six decades, nobody’s donedirecting,winemaking,orbig fitsbetter than this guy. The clashing patterns, the slouchy trousers, the low-key loafs—this iseclectic grandpa styledone oh-so-right. White loafers can be harder to pull off, but they work a charm with boldly-hued, disco-ready tailoring. Long before tech fabrics andhype Jordansdominated the fairways, style-minded folks like JFK could go a full 18 in a natty knit cardigan and shiny penny loafers. With a look as simple and monochromatic as this one, the right pair of gleaming loafers does all the talking. Forever the ultimate travel shoes—just slip ’em on and go. Nothing says Cannes quite like aseersucker suitand suede loafers in matching shades of strawberry pink. You might think trousers this wide would require a heavier, chunkier shoe. But the daintier loafers actually make the whole thing sing. From thefitted Lacoste poloto the polished black loafers, this entire fit looks just as good today as it did almost 60 years ago. Leather jacket, clean tee, nicetrousers, black loafers. A home run every time. How do you cap off an impeccable alabaster ensemble like this one? With contrasting patent leather loafers and a rakish hint of bare ankle. One of menswear’s most righteous designers giving a master class in knocking the stuffiness out of your loafers. There's a jumble of sporty-casual and dressy-formal elements at play here. The loafers cut through the noise and make it all make sense. These are cut high enough to be considered a chukka boot, but they still count as loafers in our book. Mostly because the rest of this look—the scarf, the khakis, thepose—was too iconic not to include. More From GQ Connect ©2025Condé Nast.

    "title": "Tim Robinson's ‘Friendship’ Is Officially A Box-Office Hit. No, Seriously",
    "article_text": "For many years, it was easy to take Tim Robinson for granted. Lorne Michaels, Comedy Central executives, the majority of the American public throughout the 2010s—we all allowed his genius to go unrecognized, even asRobinsonwas around, working, and building a small butloyal following among alt-sketch comedy nerds. That all changed starting in 2019, with the first season of his Netflix virality machineI Think You Should Leave, which placed Robinson in rarefied air—with perhaps only Rachel Sennott andAyo Edibirias his peers—as the most singular comedic star to emerge this decade. This weekend, writer/director Andrew DeYoung’sFriendship—starring Robinson as a suburban dad fixated on his suave new neighbor (Paul Rudd)—expanded from 6 screens to 60, pulled in $1.4 million at the box office, and became the year’s top-grossing limited release. In classic Robinson fashion, the movie is a weird, fucked-up, anti-pop object, but it may go down in history as the project that helped Robinson complete his impossible-to-see-coming ascent to mainstream-comedy stardom, in a moment when the idea of a mainstream American comedy star has never been more imperiled. Every generation gets the comedic persona it deserves.Adam Sandler’s characters—arrested in their development, with a wellspring of rage hiding just below the surface—expressed the dopey, willfully ignorant optimism of Clinton’s mid-’90s.Will Ferrell’s guys reflected the hubristic idiotic imperial bluster of W. Bush’s aughts. Louis CK’s quasi-autobiographical TV self was a perfect 2010s Obama liberal, thoughtful and performatively righteous, and ultimately hollow. And Tim Robinson is the comedian of whatever this unbearable moment in culture will one day be understood as. He has a pinched, elastic, murine face—chinless, with a wedge of beak nose, elfin ears, and a simian brow that yearns to furrow. He reminds me of my eight year old daughter—or more precisely a child cosplaying as an adult, someone who thinks they’re projecting humor, or anger, or confidence based on a learned, purely visual relationship with these emotions and the behaviors and expressions and vocal tones they seem to correspond to, an affect that registers onscreen as heightened,commedia dell-arteabsurdity. He curses like a third grader who’s just learned what swear words are and moves like a baby still mastering the use of its body. He is a white man, famously of Detroit, a post-industrial, depressed midwestern American city capitalism left behind. If there’s a defining element to Robinson’s comedic persona, it’s the Trumpian double-down (which it must be saidstands in direct opposition to his actual politics). His go-to premise is that he is profoundly, eternally wrong, and remedies this by being exponentially louder and wronger, aSimpsons-esque buffoon expressing filterless id with a megaphone. His humor is drawn from response, from the lengths he will go to appear to be existing in the same reality as you or I, even as it is readily, disturbingly apparent he is not, and in this he fits snugly into our current climate of discourse and governance. From the beginning, Robinson was a comedy nerd at heart—a lover of sketch, and the well-crafted premise landed with a stunning, subversive punchline. He was spawned in the ripple of the Second City/Upright Citizens Brigade improv boom, getting his start in Second City’s since-disbanded Detroit touring company, before making the inevitable move to Chicago. He took the leap alongside his former teenage level-A improv student, writing partner, scene partner, muse, and his inverse, the great Sam Richardson, a Ghanaian Michiganer whose game-show-host looks and late-night-DJ baritone mask an ability to commit to a bit just as psychotically as his best friend. Robinson was yet another case of well-chosen talent followed by utterly failed utilization atSaturday Night Live, where his high conceptual brain quickly proved far too dark and gonzo for the institution. Watch the 23 sketches he appeared in over his single season as a performer—SNL’s 38th, in 2012—and it’s clear how misplaced he was, incapable of playing a convincing straight man or doing an impression of someone else, because he’s essentially always doing an impression of a human being. After a year, he moved to the writing staff, where he made valuable connections but got few sketches past dress rehearsal, and by 2016 he was gone. He seemed to be drawing on a treasure trove of rejectedSNLideas in his next two projects,Detroiters—a sketch show disguised as a sitcom, underappreciated in its Comedy Central run except by the devout followers who became the core of Robinson’s cult—and thenI Think You Should Leave, the near instant hit, delivered in deranged crushable streamed increments, that made him a household name. Both series felt like an evolutionary leap, landing as a kind of compromise between Tim Heidecker and Eric Warheim’s Adult Swim acid tests and the lineage of social humor sketch shows that hasMr. Show,Chappelle’s Show,Key & Peele, andInside Amy Schumerin its DNA. Robinson is always selling. In the sketches that are most clearly in his voice on SNL, as half of a marketing team onDetroiters, in much ofI Think You Should Leave, and inFriendship—where he’s a creative at a company that helps make products (or politicians) more habit-forming, the exact type of thing Don Draper would be doing if he’d risen through the ad game in the 21st century—he finds a rich vein to tap in the idea of a moron trying to land a profoundly bad idea. (If Robinson has a second natural scene partner/counterpart besides Richardson, it’s Conner O’Malley, the YouTube auteur blurring comedy and horror with Robinsonesque projects like last year’s cult hitRap World, and fits right into the normalized frenzy ofFriendship.) The Dadaist insanity of Robinson’s comedy, his willingness to indulge running gags that a humorist with less courage would leave in the writers room, obscures his true obsession, amplifying the absurdity of social conventions to outrageous extremes in order to highlight that absurdity. Most cringe comedy is derived from vulnerability, the deeply, unbearably human overshare: A guy who can’t stop leaving a series of messages on the answering machine of a woman he’s just met, “fumbling the bag” in real time. A boss blissfully unaware he’s making everyone uncomfortable with racially insensitive jokes. Moments that you want to look away from, but can’t. Robinson is something else, a force multiplier of discomfort, a cartoonishly abrasive weirdo for an anti-social age, who finds the truth hiding beneath the veneer of social obligation—that you don’t like the firefighter pugs calendar he got you for your birthday—and will take the confrontation to operatic heights to beat that admission out of you. Friendshipis a continuation of this project—one long bout of post-hang anxiety, a Blue Monday fever dream dosed with toad venom. It’s the filmic nightmare manifestation of the self-questioning, “Was I awkward at that social gathering in that one interaction?” paranoia-induced panic attack, and in this case it really is that bad and the answer is yes, with consequences taken to the extreme. The film is an A24 comedy that plays more like A24 horror—more David Robert Mitchell than Nicolas Stoller in its camera work, the score more ambient Phillip Glass via the Safdies than the sunny needle drops that populate the bromances it's riffing on, likeI Love You Man(with one obvious exception). It’s a bleak and relentless 100-minute squirm that lacks any real story structure and should have no commercial viability. But my sold-out screening Friday was a fucking punk show. A guy in a Pen-and-Pixel-level photoshopped Tim Robinson T-shirt behind me brought what appeared to be an entire intramural kickball team with him to the Angelika, and the crowd hung on Robinson’s every word and gesture, exploding with laughter at non-jokes the way we used to at the actual jokes in proper studio comedies. Robinson sings in a part written for him, and the film has all his hallmarks—the outrageous emotional explosions, the idiot logic that makes perfect sense, the non-resolutions, and the recurring gag about a fictional clothing company called Ocean View Dining that also sells food and is so fucking funny but I can’t really articulate exactly why. Or I should say I do: Because the brand clearly crawled out of the brain of Tim Robinson, the head-fucked arbiter of this frightening, confusing, lonely, nihilistically hilarious American moment.",

    "title": "‘The Last Of Us’ Finally Revealed What Happened Between Joel and Ellie",
    "article_text": "What happened between Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey)? That question has lingered throughout season two ofThe Last of Us. Fromthe beginning of this sophomore outing, an unspoken tension has lingered over the interactions between the two series leads. Now, with this week’s episode, a flashback that fills in the gaps of this season’s five-year time jump, we know why. Using Ellie’s birthday as a narrative device, the Neil Druckmann-directed episode shows us the slow deterioration of Ellie and Joel’s relationship, culminating in Ellie catching Joel in a lie about why he killed Eugene (Joe Pantoliano), which prompts her to start asking real questions about what Joelreallydid to save her from the Fireflies at the end of season one. The episode starts and ends with narratives about what parents do to protect their children, something thatThe Last of Usco-creator Druckmann knows a lot about. Throughout his work at Naughty Dog—the gaming studio behind suchPlayStationhits asThe Last of Us,Uncharted, and more—he’s returned repeatedly to stories about familial bonds. As such, this week’s installment, co-written by Craig Mazin and Halley Gross, was the ideal moment for him to returntothe director’s chair. With only one episode left before the second-season finale, GQ sat down with Druckmann over Zoom to talk about shooting this episode, why the show tappedBetter Call Saul’sTony Daltonto play Joel’s father, and the significance ofJoel’s beloved watch. Neil Druckmann:This was something I thought a lot about. I have very limited time. I talked with Craig, I talked with, actually, Pedro quite a bit, and it felt like this episode in particular, 2x06, got into the heart of this entire story, of the core relationship of Ellie and Joel. What they're talking about, especially on that porch scene, is really speaking to the themes of everything we've done and things we're going to do in the future. I was also excited to do an episode that had no action—it was just all drama. I felt like I could really stretch myself as a director. He left for a while. We shot the other episodes between two and six, and then he came back specifically for this episode. He was generous enough to clear his schedule, and we had a healthy amount of time to shoot this episode with him. Pedro's become a friend. He's very charming as you see [laughs], and he's that way in real life. It was exciting, but pretty quickly it became about the work. Focusing and knowing that this is our last bite of the apple with him and making sure that we honor the character as much as we can. This character means so much to myself and so many of us on the gaming side, on the show side. I think that's why everybody brought their all. Ilovethe performance that he gave in this episode. Oh my God, so much. There's a lot of overlap between directing for video games, especially the games that we do here at Naughty Dog, because they are so cinematic and very story-driven, character-driven. But there's an order of operations that's a little bit different. When we shoot for the game, we could still change a lot of things after the fact. I could change all the cameras completely and I still have the performance. The performance exists as data in 3D, so virtually, we could put the camera wherever we want. We could change the lighting after the fact, we could change the set, their costumes, even their props—all that is up for grabs even after we shoot. On the show side, you do all this prep months in advance. That space capsule sequence, we were working on months before I even arrived, just talking through the plan, what's that going to look like, how that's going to be. Then, as you get closer, you start rehearsing things if there's any sort of stunt or any special effects — It just gets more and more intense as you get close to the day of shooting, whatever it is you've been working on. Then you say “action” and you hold your breath, and then you say “cut.” When it all works, it's pretty incredible because all that work you caught on camera—except for some exceptions with VFX— what you got is what it is. It's very, very high stress and there's not a lot of leeway to fix things after the fact. I learned—I mean, I already knew this from season one, but it was reinforced going to season two — I want it to be as prepped as possible. I wanted to storyboard as much of it as possible to do all my scene preparation, everything beforehand. I wasn't going to leave anything to chance. All that prep gave me the confidence to be more experimental on the day to say, “Okay, we have this whole plan, we know all these shots. What if we did things a little bit differently? What if we mess with the blocking? What if I gave the actorsmorefreedom to try things?” I think I had more confidence doing that this time than I had last time. And also now I have a bit of [time] working with Bella and Pedro under my belt. I've learned much more, [and] I had more of a shorthand with them. The first time, it's like we're getting to know each other while we're figuring out how each one of us works, while we're making the thing. We already got that out of the way. Now, it's really just about the material and the quickest, most efficient way to get there, so we could spend as much time on the day trying out different options. There’s the scene where Joel catches Ellie with Kat. These two girls are hooking up, Kat is giving Ellie the tattoo, and they'resmoking weed. The initial blocking, even the way it's described in the script, is by the end of that fight between her and Joel, Ellie is standing still facing the door so that when Joel storms out, he slams the door and we see her with a door slammed in front of her. I really wanted the actors to just play with the blocking and not be so prescriptive. We tried various levels of how antagonistic they were towards each other. And actually, where we landed is the middle ground. We started pretty hot, went a little softer and then found that sweet Goldilocks, as we call it. And then the blocking—I saw [that] Bella naturally had their back to him as he left. I'm like, “You know what? Let's move the whole setup around. Let's catch that, [have it] be the final moment of the scene, and we’re just left with her face and you see him out of focus in the background, slam the door behind her.” It just felt better. It felt more natural. That's the thing I'm constantly pursuing: any false note, anything that doesn't feel natural must be excised, because I think that's the best way to get the audience lost in the scene, is for it to feel like something they might witness themselves. Well, “on the day” is multiple days. There was the exterior part, and then the interior was actually a totally different sound stage where we built an interior. The reason that was the case is we had to build a very special interior that we could remove panels to make room for the camera crew. when we're inside and we're looking at Bella, the whole area behind us – there’s like a whole wall is removed and it's a very specific lighting setup. Then the reverse is true; we're looking at Joel. I remember while I'm prepping and shooting the other scenes for the episode, every several days, I meet with Ksenia [Sereda], my partner on the episode, my DP, and she would show me the rehearsal. It's two camera crews on cranes that have to synchronize their movements to get that movement of the sun and the lighting as Ellie's in her imagination in space. Ksenia and I would talk about it; I'd give some notes. That plate is spinning, [I’d] go do a bunch of other stuff, meet again. It just felt like that one in particular, we're spending a long time just prepping. Then you get to the day, and we also have to add hydraulics on top of it, so there's another crew that's working the hydraulics to shake the whole thing. So many people were working in unison, and it was like a dance choreography of making sure when this happens, this happens, and then this happens, and then this happens. We did the first several times, and it goes wrong. The timing is off, the cranes weren't lined up exactly, the clock is ticking, and you're running out of time. Then when we got it, it was such a high. Everybody's cheering and high-fiving each other, and I could tell that we got something really special. My goal was not to make it identical to the game. In fact, I was constantly encouraging Ksenia, “Let's get some different shots.” One of them that we don't have in the game is this profile shot on Ellie. You just see the joy in her face and the way the light is refracting against that helmet; it was just such a beautifully composed shot. Again, different from the game, but that's not the goal. The game is our inspiration. It's our reference, and then we have to have the freedom to find it in this other medium. I really liked those happy accidents. Another one that stood out to me, and I remember seeing it on the day that we shot, is at the end when Joel's asking, “Did I do all right?” You see Pedro turn, and we didn't catch him crying, but as he turns his head, you could see the glint of a tear in his wrinkles. Again, those are those happy accidents that if we were doing that in the game, we would have to think about that ahead of time, be like, “Oh, we should catch a tear in there,” and then some modeler would have to put that in. This is the synchronicity of working with people live. You get all those happy accidents. That was a special moment. I clocked it on the day, and then I made sure we used it in the edit. My editor Simon [Smith], we have very similar tastes, so he was gravitating towards that immediately as well. That sequence, where it fits in that episode, is like,This is the happiest we'll ever see them. There's such a joy as a parent when you can make your kid happy. When you can make your kid super happy, you'll often cry. I've experienced this, and the fact that Pedro went there naturally and we caught it—I was very excited. I can't even take credit for that. I believe that was Halley Gross, my co-writer on the game and the show. Once we had that scene, I don't remember if she wrote it in or she said it, but I was like, “Oh, that should be his watch.” As soon as I heard, I'm like, “Of course it has to be his watch.” So much of what we're talking about is parents passing on either their trauma or their hope, but there's certain programming that you pass on from parent to child, and then the child becomes a parent and so on. This felt like another way of symbolizing the passage of those things. Then it has additional meaning: The fact that Sarah had to go and get it fixed—that watch is already loaded with so much meaning. The fact that it came from his dad takes it even further. This was a conversation that we had in that — I believe this was a Craig idea— it felt interesting that Ellie doesn't know a lot about that watch, and even if she does, the fact that she chooses the gun over the watch should tell you a lot about her mindset at that moment. It’s less about my memory of him, of holding onto these positive feelings, and it's more likeI must destroy the people that have hurt him. That is where her mind goes immediately, and stays there for a while. Once we had a shape of that scene—it was in outline form, we didn't have a script yet—I brought up Tony because ofBetter Call Saul. I loved him so much in that show. I thought he just brought so much with so little, which felt like what we ask our actors to do on our show. I always had him in mind for this role. It just felt like hecouldbe Pedro's relative. You squint, and you could see it. I remember that Zoom call; Craig and I jumped on a Zoom call with Tony. I had met him previously at the Emmys, and I gushed over his work inBetter Call Saul. I was very nervous for this call. Every time I meet somebody whose work I admire, I get a little nervous. We talked to him a little bit. I walked him through like, “Hey, here's what we're thinking for the scene. Here's the structure of it. Here's ultimately what you're going to pass on to Joel and it's going to bookend at the end of the episode where he's going to recall this conversation with you.” I'm expecting him to ask questions, and he just listened to it and he goes, ”I'm in. Yeah, I'd love to do this.” And I'm like, “Great, we'll see you in Canada” [laughs]. The next time I saw him was in Canada, directing him, [and] shooting the scene. My highest priority in life is my family. That's something I got from my parents. For example, when I was young and my dog passed away, my parents didn't know how to tell me, so they kind of lied to me about it and told me, “He's at the vet.” They were trying to ease me into this truth. Then, my friend called me and he was like, “Dude, I'm sorry your dog passed away.” I was so shocked by my dog's death and by my parents lying to me about it, I just slept for like 48 hours. This is the way my mom describes it; I don't remember any of this. When we moved to the US, they lied to me about that. They didn't tell me that we were going to stay here. That turned out to be the hardest year of my life, moving from Israel to the United States, and the fact that I didn’t get to say goodbye to my friend was traumatic for me. They did it to try and protect me. But those lies have stuck with me so much, [and] that is why Joel lies to Ellie at the end of season one, at the end of game one. He's trying to protect her in the way that my parents have tried to do it with me. So those things, and my feeling of protection for my kids and wanting to make them safe, sometimes at any cost necessary—those occupy the majority of my thoughts. Oh, music has been a big part of my life. I've been playing guitar since I was 14, so sometimes it's an escape. It's my meditation. If I'm feeling overly stressed, I'll pick up the guitar and just play for a while. That seems to occupy enough of my brain where I could calm things down. Some of that has made it into the show in the way Ellie uses guitar. But also, music has been such a big part of my life. There's certain pieces of music that elicit such a strong emotional reaction for me that I've tried to incorporate those pieces into my work and use them as a way to elicit similar feeling in how I feel about them.“Future Days,”in particular, is a song I used to sing to my daughter when she was a newborn. It had this extra meaning to me, but it felt like with the lyrics and everything, it just made sense for Joel to hold that song in the same regard towards Ellie. That's why he chooses to sing—out of all the songs he probably knows—that one specifically.",

    "title": "The Onion’s Ben Collins Knows How to Save Media",
    "article_text": "What’s the biggest difference betweenElon Muskand the CEO ofThe Onion? “I know I’m not funny—and he has no idea,” saysBen Collins,the former NBC News reporter who bought the satirical newspaper with Twilio founderJeff Lawsonlast year. In the 12 months since,The Onionhas reached new comic heights—see: viral headlines like“Nation Can’t Believe It on Harvard’s Side”—while increasing its cultural footprint. But again, Collins says, that’s because he’s been smart enough to leave the actual comedy to the experts. “There are definitely people who would come in here and just be like, ‘I’m the funniest man in the world. Let’s go attack trans people or something. That would be their version of what satire is. Just like, for example, the song ‘The Reason’ by Hoobastank is alsotechnicallymusic, it is not the kind of music that I want to listen to.” Instead, Collins has focused on gettingThe Onionthe resources it so desperately needed, as well as pruning back the bullshit so the paper’s content can shine. “We took this thing that was dying a slow internet heat death and turned it into a real newspaper and much bigger business,” he exclusively tellsVanity Fair.“There was a boner-pill ad shawl that covered all of our content, and you just couldn’t read it. We got rid of all of it. We reset revenue to zero for a month or two while we figured out how to make and ship a paper to tens of thousands of people.” Collins has expanded the staff from 14 employees to 27; he anticipates hiring eight more by the end of the year. He’s invested resources into video content, relaunching parody television news network “ONN” (Onion News Network) on YouTube and—in a shocking move for any online publication in this day and age—he’s also brought backThe Onion’s print arm, which initially folded in 2013. “I’m not saying every newspaper should get back and print immediately.The New York Observer,or whatever the fuck, I don’t think it would behoove them to start doing this shit,” he says. “But we can be super funny in print, and people like getting a nice thing in the mail.” Although he’s quick to claim that, in some ways, he’s just been lucky, Collins also has a game plan for building a thriving 21st-century media brand that he’s more than happy to share with other publications—eventually. “We want to help other people get into print soon,” he says. “That’s our plan too. It can’t just be us.” In a declining industry where everyone is obsessed with doing more with less, Collins’sOnionis legitimately growing. “It’s like a miracle,” he says. “I wish the media didn’t have to collapse for people to have to look at us as a model for making money and being successful, but here we are.” Below, Collins sits for a long chat about leaving NBC News after feuding with Elon Musk, his romantic relationship with aspiring politicianKat Abughazaleh,the status ofThe Onion’s attempt to purchaseInfoWars,and so much more. Vanity Fair:You were a reporter at NBC News before becoming CEO ofThe Onion. What was that transition like for you? Ben Collins:I used to be a disinformation reporter. I was covering all these bad guys. There was a flip that switched a couple of years ago where I started seeing my bosses thinking, like, Uh oh, he’s going to continue to report on Elon Musk? This is not a great thing. Everyone could see them shaking their collars out. They were like, The fascism’s coming, and he’s still doing this? So it was a weird and awkward last year at my job. I think I have some modicum of social skills. I can read the room. I know when I’m not welcome there anymore. Did you feel that they were doing anything to impede your actual journalism? Oh, dude. I gotsuspendedfor being too mean to Elon Musk. And by the way, it was for basically just reporting on him. It was not anything crazy. After that, I realized my time on this peacock is short. When I sawThe Onionwas for sale, I realized that maybe I didn’t have to live my entire life in this doldrumescent hell. I started chasing this thing, and we really did save it from what we would now call AI death. Or the throes of a decabillionaire who is worried about white genocide. Elon Musk is a great character because you can’t punch down on him. Are you ever worried about punching down? We’re constantly worried about that. Good comedy, in my opinion, is dissecting power. It’s dissecting power in our own personal lives and power in everything else. I think we are wholly aware of the expectation of cruelty right now in comedy. Zagging is actually helpful, because that shit doesn’t last. You look back through time, 23 years ago, and whoever they decided to pick on, it’s like, Ugh, yuck. When you look back at comedy that worked, it’s like, Who are the people trying to actively oppress us? And what are the things that are taken as true as fact by elites and by people in power that are just obviously not the case? The good comedy is the stuff that lives in that dissonance. There are people here who really do want to hold power to account, and the best way to do that is by making fun of ’em. There’s nothing fascists hate more than getting truly ripped on. Do you have any influence on the editorial side ofThe Onion? I don’t touch it. I don’t go in that room at all. I let them do what they want. The only thing I do is when they have something that I know is a banger, I’m like, Where do we put this thing? Do we put it on the streets? We’ve wheatpasted stuff, made it graffiti in real life. And when there is a psychopath’s company available for sale in a bankruptcy process, we do try to purchase it. You did try to play the ultimate joke on Sandy Hook conspiracy theorist Alex Jones bybuying his media platform Infowarsat auction, but a judgeblocked the sale. What’s the status ofThe Onionpurchasing Infowars? It’s still up in the air. We still want it at present. It is in literal legal limbo.Alex Jonesis nothing if not a person who can harangue the court until his lifespan winds up shorter than him receiving justice. [Laughs.] He’s like theMichael Jordanof harassing the American legal system. So he never faces consequences. We always knew it was going to be bad, but we didn’t think we would be ruled the winner of it and have that taken away—have a judge reverse months of rulings. It’s an unprecedented situation. If you talk to any lawyer, it’s never happened before. Everyone’s just sort of trying to figure out what happens next—and we are part of those people. We are optimistic we’re still going to end up with it eventually, but we don’t know when eventually is. That’s the issue. What was the impact of trying to buy InfoWars? The service that we did there, I think, was real. So many people reached out to us who had lost their kids in school shootings. As you know, in America, that’s thousands more people than there should be. There shouldn’t be one. They’ve reached out to us and just said, “Thank you for even giving us this glimmer of hope for a minute.” It was a shot across the bow that decency could potentially prevail. We gave people a permission structure to think that happiness is achievable, and that’s why we’re not going to stop fighting for it. We still have people on hand, ready to go if we pull it off. And I can’t wait to show you guys what we have, because it’s fucking funny. People on both sides of the political spectrum have called President Trump funny. Do you think Donald Trump is funny? Not on purpose. I mean, he’s funny in the way that, I don’t know…you know howcats are sometimes scared of cucumbersand jump and run away? That kind of thing. His inability to comprehend reality is funny, but that’s notfunny. He also never laughs. Probably twice a week I laugh so hard I cry—probably because I work here. I’ve never seen him uncontrollably laugh in my life. And it is so antithetical to what I think being a human being is. That’s why we’re here, to have a nice time. It explains so much about him. He’s funny in the sense that callous people can be particularly biting, but he’s not funny. I think those are two different things. Unless he’s fucking up—unless he’s mispronouncing something or not understanding something fully—when people say he’s funny, it’s usually him being cruel to somebody. While we’re on the subject of political figures—did you see Bill de BlasioquotingtheclassicOnionheadline“Well, Well, Well, Not So Easy to Find a Mayor That Doesn’t Suck Shit, Huh?” Yes, I did. It is so great. It is one of my favorite headlines of all time, and it’s because the city can just not elect a normal guy. It’s just impossible. Dude—I met [NYC mayoral candidate]Zohran[Mamdani] on Saturday out of the blue. Everybody lobbiesThe Onionabout what we should be doing, obviously, and everyone’s right. He was like, “You guys got to hammer [Andrew]Cuomo.” I was like, “I can’t tell the room to go after a mayor of New York City.” Like, what the fuck? I can’t go to the room and just be like, “Now you’re going after this guy.” He literally just turns to me, he goes, “Well, well, well—not so easy to find a mayor who doesn’t suck shit, huh?” I was like, “Well, you got me, dude. I don’t know what you want me to say.” I’m sure the room will naturally come to its conclusions about which of these candidates is a human being. But that’s just an eternal and iconic headline. And it is true. It is seemingly impossible for New York City to elect a regular person. It’s crazy thatBill de Blasiowas probably the closest. Now that you’re CEO ofThe Onion,you’re more of a public figure. How have you been handling the response to your romantic relationship with Kat Abughazaleh, the journalist and social media influencer whorecently announced a run for US Congressin Illinois? I mean, it’s weird. I’ve never publicly dated anybody. My girlfriend came to me earlier this year and was like, “I don’t really feel represented on the planet earth anymore and I don’t know what to do about it. And I’m thinking about running for Congress.” I don’t know. I tried my whole life to be a decent and good person, especially to my friends and family and my partners. I was like, “Yeah, let’s fucking go.” Kat is one of the smartest people I’ve ever met in my entire life. She has an ability to reach people on their level that I’ve never met in another person at all. And I’m not going to say, “I’m not just saying this because this is my girlfriend.” Of course I’m saying this because she’s my girlfriend. What fucking idiot would not say that, right? But I also truly, genuinely believe it. So I was like, “All right, what can I do to help?” What does a decent person do in this moment to make it so she can provide the good that she provides to the world? You saw her launch video, right? It was, like, fucking “Stone Cold” Steve Austin.You could hear the glass breaking. This girl’s got the fucking juice. And, colloquially, I knew she had the sauce, but I did not know until that moment that she had the juice. I’m fucking emotional. I was so just genuinely proud of her, and it’s weird that we sit at home every night and watchJeopardy!and look at our cats’ dumb faces. What would you say to people who might be worried about your ability to cover the news objectively because of your relationship? There’s a couple of things here. One, I just don’t go in that room and tell them what to do. I’ve never touchedOnioncopy. I just do businessy stuff. But also, until the day [Kat] launched that video, she was a reporter. She was a researcher. She was a journalist. And I think a terrible rule is that journalists should not seek higher office when they believe that it is important to do so. One of the highest ranking people in the Canadian government is a former journalist who covered corruption in the far right. It would be a terrible rule to say those people can’t run for office. It’s a fucking terrible idea. Candidly, when I put in my notice [at NBC], I had talked through it with her. I was like, “Look, I’m going to go write a book and I’m not going to have a steady income for…I don’t even know.” She was like, “All right, we’ll figure it out. We’ll work off mine and you can try to get some freelance stuff in the meantime.” When it came to me upending my life for my bullshit, she was totally down. And it turned out to not be bullshit at all. It worked out great for me. When she wants to upend her life for something that’s real and important and something that really only she can or has done, it would be ghoulish behavior to be like, “No, actually. Excuse me. Only I get to chase my dreams, and only I get to do the thing that I know I’m good at and can help a lot of people.” What kind of person would that be? So that’s part of it too. Obviously,The Onionwill do nothing from now on but run articles about how cool my girlfriend is. [Laughs.] It’s the number one thing that readership wants and expects from us. It’s identical toJeff Bezos.I am also going tosend her into space, and everyone at my paper has to cover it as if it’s the coolest thing that’s ever happened. What’s your take on the state of comedy these days? Everything’s so diffuse. Things that are bad are worse than ever. And things that are good, I think, are better than ever. I would even say the commercial comedy is pretty good. I likeNate Bargatze.I think he’s good. And I think there are people taking insane risks, likeNathan Fielder,who is just a remarkable figure. There’s a lot of good. And also, the dumb, Bluesky-centric joke stuff is good. The democratization of comedy is good and bad as well. I’ve seen TikToks and YouTube shorts and shit like that that are fucking instant classics. They’re really good. And then there’s the bad. You know what the bad is: guys with tiny mustaches and round faces doing the same exact fucking thing. God bless ’em, but they are not fucking funny. They seem to have more purchase among people with billions of dollars than I think is acceptable. We always go through phases like this, and they’re very short. The ’80s went through anAndrew Dice Claymoment, and the ’90s went through a similar kind of thing. “I’m just a beer-drinking man. What is it with those immigrants?” That shit. There’s fucking four jokes, and they make them over and over again, and then two years goes by and nobody wants to deal with it anymore. And I feel like we’re nearing the end of those two years—in part because this time, the accelerated death of it is because they’re attached to a fascist government that no one likes. They quite literally did roasts on his behalf. This is a natural endpoint. For a comedy publication,The Onionis unafraid to tackle hot-button issues, like the conflict in Gaza. How do you handle thornier issues? Is anything off-limits? No. They’re allowed to go after whatever they want to, and they do.Nilay PatelatThe Vergeonce saidthatThe Onion’s motto is basically, “Don’t kill people.” And that is correct. That is basically what it is. We inherently distrust politicians, but it really comes down to “stop killing people.” Once that starts to inform the editorial worldview, it makes a lot more sense, right? It gives them a pretty clear moral clarity on things like Gaza and on things like trans rights, because there are clear moral panics and government bullshit happening around both. We don’t tell them not to do anything. We let them absolutely go for it. It’s so interesting that an outlet that encourages its writers to speak truth to power is flourishing in a media industry where everything else seems to be in decline. I want that to be a lesson to people. Kowtowing to power—if your job is not that, nobody fucking wants that. It does nothing for you to pull a punch at this moment. You have to be able to stand up for a baseline of humanity. That’s what we do here. And I’m glad to tell you that they never blinked. They never thought twice about it. They just always were like, “All right, well, let’s keep doing what we do here.” What does the future ofThe Onionlook like? I say this all the time around here now, but the world’s our canvas now. Where can we show up in ways that make it so people think that good things are technically possible? Where do we show up where people are, and where do we show up where people don’t even know we could show up? That is my goal for the next few months. .We’re going to be doing that in various different places. It requires money to do it—so if you don’t subscribe toThe Onion,I will fucking kill you. Tell your readers that. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

    "title": "How Joe Biden's Cancer Diagnosis Disrupts the Discourse Around His Failed 2024 Candidacy",
    "article_text": "Democrats are experiencing an intense bout of whiplash from theJoe Bidennews cycle. Newrevelationsfrom a highly anticipated book,Original Sin,by CNN’sJake Tapperand Axios’sAlex Thompson, have reopened old wounds from the 2024 election, with elected officials—and even some 2028 hopefuls—facing uncomfortable questions this past week about Biden’s cognitive decline in office and his fateful decision to run for reelection.Original Sin, which officially hits shelves Tuesday, adds fresh reporting on the race, and follows a couple books,Chris Whipple’sUnchartedandAmie ParnesandJon Allen’sFight, which also delved into Biden’s bungled candidacy and the party’s loss toDonald Trump. It’s a conversation many in Biden’s party would prefer to avoid, and indeed, former Transportation SecretaryPete Buttigiegarguedthat the Democrats are “not in a position to wallow in hindsight” as they’ve got “some fundamental tests for the future of the country and this party.” Senate Minority LeaderChuck Schumerexpressed a similarsentimenttelling reporters on Tuesday, “We’re just looking forward.” Last week, in response to the news cycle, a spokesperson from Biden’s officeargued, “We're still waiting for someone, anyone to point out where Joe Biden had to make a presidential decision or make a presidential address where he was unable to do his job because of mental decline.\" But such sentiments couldn’t slow a flood of leaks and excerpts detailing previously unreported instances of health lapses, including Biden not recognizingGeorge Clooneyat afundraiserand internal suggestions that he use awheelchairif elected to a second term. The book also explores the tactics that the White House engaged in to dissuade the media from reporting on said health concerns, including a strategy that encouraged Democratic operatives to attack journalists publicly. Some Democrats opted to publicly distance themselves from Biden and the administration’s calculated strategy to keep his health decline out of the public eye. During anappearanceonPod Save America,Beto O’Rourkeargued that “Biden should not have run again,” in 2024, adding that he “failed this country in the most important job that he had.” In astatementto theWashington Post, Rep.Ro Khannasaid, “In my few interactions at public events, I found him coherent and proud of his record, but it is now painfully obvious he should not have run.” Even Buttigiegacknowledgedthat “maybe” Democrats would’ve been better off if Biden had not run again. Right now, with the benefit of hindsight,” he said, “I think most people would agree that that’s the case.” The discourse even made its way toSaturday Night Live, where “Weekend Update” coanchorColin Jostjokedthat “according to a new tell-all book, Biden’s inner circle reveals that they were worried the president would need a wheelchair in his second term. Especially after they were all done stabbing him in the back.” The following morning, Khanna was on ABC’sThis Weekreiteratingthat “obviously, he should not have run,” while over on Meet the Press, SenatorChris MurphytoldNBC News’sKristen Welkerthat “in retrospect, you can't defend what the Democratic Party did because we are stuck with a madman, a corrupt president in the Oval Office, and we should've given ourselves a better chance to win.\" But the Sunday-showchatterabout former president’s fitness and decision-making in the last campaign cycle gave way to the shocking announcement that afternoon that he had beendiagnosedwith an “aggressive form” of prostate cancer which has already metastasized in his bones. “Cancer touches us all,” Bidenwroteon social media, accompanying a photo of him, and his wife,Dr. Jill Biden. “Like so many of you, Jill and I have learned that we are strongest in the broken places. Thank you for lifting us up with love and support.” TV news networks immediately pivoted to breaking newscoverage, bringing on health experts and Democratic advisors to discuss the former president’s concerning condition and what this means going forward for the party. Just minutes after the news broke of Biden’s diagnosis, longtime Democratic operative and CNN contributorDavid Axelrodwas on air,arguingthat the book’s news cycle should be quieted out of respect for the former president. Discussions about Biden’s health “should be more muted and set aside for now as he’s struggling through this,” Axelrod said. Axelrod himself contributed significantly to Tapper and Thompson’s book, with two chapters specifically dedicated to his actions while Biden was in office. Whether Democrats are able to truly table the conversation for another time remains to be seen. On Monday morning, Democrats continued to face questions about Biden’s ability to run in 2024. Rep.Josh Gottheimerjoined CNN’sJohn Bermanfor aninterviewwho asked the congressman, “Separately and respectfully, there are questions right now about former president Biden and his capacity when he was still running for reelection…what do you think the right level of accountability is for Democrats like you running for office on that subject?” “If the question is, should we make sure that our candidates are up to the job? Of course,” Gottheimer responded. “Listen, when it comes to president Biden, I think we should all focus on his recovery and thinking about him.” The congressman argued that there will be plenty of other times to “talk about what should have been.” Ro Khanna Really Believes“Blue MAGA” Can Save the Dems—and Steve Bannon Loves It Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years.

    "title": "JD Vance, King Felipe, Queen Letizia, Prince Albert and More Attend Pope Leo XIV's Inaugural Mass",
    "article_text": "Ten days after his election in a speedy conclave,Pope Leo XIV(formerly Robert Francis Prévost) gathered his faithful in St. Peter's Square for the inaugural mass of his pontificate. Before the mass began, tens of thousands of the gathered observers at the foot of St. Peter's Basilica were able to catch a glimpse of the pontiff arriving. Hegreeted the crowd from his popemobile—a first since his election. As was the case for Pope Francis' funeral, which took placeon April 26,many heads of state and political representatives were in attendance. Vice PresidentJD Vance,who was among the last to meet with the previous Pope Francis, arrived with his wifeUsha. Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelensky, accompanied by his wifeOlena Zelenska, European Commission PresidentUrsula Von der Leyenand Italian Prime MinisterGiorgia Melonitook part in the mass, as did French Prime MinisterFrançois Bayrou. All greeted the Pope with a handshake inside the basilica. Many royals also accepted the invitation.King Felipe VIand his wifeQueen Letiziawere seated not far fromKing PhilippeandQueen Mathildeof Belgium. A few seats further back wereQueenMaximaof the Netherlands,Prince AlbertandPrincessCharlèneof Monaco, who pairedher customary white veilwith a midi-length dress by designerElie Saabfor the event. Grand DukeHenriand Grand DuchessMariaTeresaof Luxembourg were also among the parishioners. All four women made use of their privilege of white—which entitles certain Catholic queens and princesses to wear a veil and white garments when meeting the Pope.Princess Victoriarepresented the Swedish crown, whilePrince Edwardrepresented the United Kingdom. The service addressed the state of affairs across nations. \"We still see too much discord, too many wounds caused by hatred, violence, prejudice, fear of the other, by an economic paradigm that exploits the Earth's resources and marginalizes the poorest,\" Pope Leo XIV lamented. He also spoke of the humanitarian situation inGaza and that its inhabitants had been “reduced to starvation”and called for \"negotiations for a just and lasting peace\" for the “martyred Ukraine.” Later in the day, the Ukrainian president met the Pope for a private audience, and then spoke for around 30 minutes with the Vice President Vance. The two politiciansdiscussed the telephone call between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin scheduled for Monday. Originally published in Vanity Fair France.

    "title": "Meghan Markle’s Anniversary Post: An Inside Look at All The Easter Eggs",
    "article_text": "On Monday,Meghan Marklecelebratedher seventh weddinganniversary withPrince Harry.On Instagram, the As Ever founder marked the occasion by sharing a look at the couple’s “love story” as shown through photos on a bulletin board. The post is captioned with a message of appreciation for the affection they have received from friends and from the public, and it contains plenty of never-before-seen images of the couple and their two children,Prince ArchieandPrincess Lilibet of Sussex.A source close to the couple toldVanity Fairthat the photos include a sonogram of Archie and a photo taken within one hour of his birth back in 2019. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. \"Seven years of marriage. A lifetime of stories,” Meghan’s caption read. “Thanks to all of you (whether by our side, or from afar) who have loved and supported us throughout our love story—we appreciate you.” The photographs on the bulletin board are both personal and professional. There are a handful of photos from Meghan and Harry'sofficial engagement sessionwithAlexi Lubomirskyin 2017, along with one from their wedding and another shoot he did with the couple in 2023. It also features a few behind-the-scenes looks from their friendMisan Harriman,and others fromChris Allerton,whocaptured major events for the couplein 2019 and 2020. The photos show off their travels around the world, including a 2016 photo from Botswana that includes a shirtless Harry, one of the couple fromtheir royal tour to Australia in 2018, with a photo showing the couple doing a hongi, traditional Māori greeting, in New Zealand during the same tour of the South Pacific, along with a few fromtheir 2019 trip to Morocco. In the section for 2021, Meghan shared a new photograph of Lili soon after her birth, next to an image of Meghan holding her two children on the floor in their Santa Barbara home. An especially cute photo shows Archie giving Lili a hug. There are few new photos showing all four members of the family, including one from 2022 taken in a grassy yard and another from 2024 showing them on a coastline. The arrangement also featured easter eggs referencing the couple’s years together, along with references to Meghan’s longtime love for music from a previous generation. The 2018 section features a a sketch of the duchess’s crest, which went into their joint coat of arms. A note in the 2022 section reads, “We were together, I forget the rest,” a paraphrase of a line from Walt Whitman’s “Once I pass’d through a populous city,” a poem fromLeaves of Grassabout a brief relationship between a man and a woman. In her now-famous calligraphic handwriting, Meghan also wrote out the lyrics to the Ben E. King song, “Stand By Me,” which played when the couplewalked down the aisleof St. George’s Chapel in Windsor. In keeping with the theme oftheir recent date nightat aJames Taylorconcert, the song’s inclusion on her sentimental present to Harry is a reflection for Meghan’s penchant for holding on to the music that reminds her of her youth.

In aTruth Social postsent in the wee hours of Monday morning, Trump called for “a major investigation” into Springsteen and Beyoncé’s endorsements of former Vice PresidentKamala Harrisduring last year’s presidential race, along with those fromOprah WinfreyandBono.“Candidates aren’t allowed to pay for ENDORSEMENTS, which is what Kamala did, under the guise of paying for entertainment,” he wrote, apparently referring to the event production fees that the Harris campaign paid to celebrities' production companies, becausecampaigns are not allowedto accept in-kind donations. “In addition, this was a very expensive and desperate effort to artificially build up her sparse crowds,” Trump, forever fixated on crowd size, wrote. Trump’s tirade continued throughout the morning, ashe repeatedthe unfounded rumor that Beyoncé was paid $11 million “to walk onto a stage, quickly ENDORSE KAMALA, and walk off to loud booing for never having performed, NOT EVEN ONE SONG!” It was the latest celebrity tongue-lashing by Trump, who also threw a Truth Social tantrum last week in response to Springsteen’s comments about this administration during his “Land of Hope & Dreams” tour. “In my home, they’re persecuting people for their right to free speech and voicing their dissent. That’s happening now,”Springsteen has saidduring his performances. Proving Springsteen’s point better than he ever could, Trump retaliated witha barely veiled threat, writing on Truth Social that Springsteen “ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country, that’s just ‘standard fare.’ Then we’ll all see how it goes for him.” Another megacelebrity (and Harris backer) facing Trump’s ire this past week isTaylor Swift.As Trump’s Middle East trip wrapped up and Republicans in the House struggled to pass Trump’s “big beautiful” spending package, thepresident wondered aloudto his online audience, “Has anyone noticed that, since I said ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,’ she’s no longer ‘HOT?’” If you’re trying to find the method behind all this madness, don’t strain your brain. Trump is a master of misdirection, and with hisapproval ratings in the toilet, the American economy in a state of upheaval, discord within his own majority party, and scrutiny swirling around his acceptance of a $400 millionplane from the Qataris, it seems like as good a time as ever to pick a fight with some of the biggest, most popular celebrities in the country. Plus, Trump can’t ever help but take the bait. It’s a familiar pattern as much as it is a warning: Accuse him of using his power to stifle dissent, and he won’t hesitate for one moment to prove you right.

    "title": "Meet JJ, the 24-Year-Old Winner of Eurovision 2025",
    "article_text": "He's the revelation ofEurovision. SingerJJ, who represented Austria at the 69th edition of the globally famous song contest, won the coveted glass microphone in Basel on Saturday, May 17. “It's absolutely crazy, my dreams have come true,” marveled JJ, whose real name is Johannes Pietsch, at the post-competitionpress conference. “It's incredible.” The 24-year-old Filipino-Austrian won with 436 points. He was ahead of Israeli contestantYuval Raphael, who came second with 357 points, just one point ahead of EstonianTommy Cashand his controversial song “Espresso Macchiato.” JJ, candidat de l'Autriche, a remporté l'Eurovision 2025. With each passing performance, JJ solidified his position as the clear favorite. Not because of any shortcomings in the other twenty-five candidates (although the standard was lower this year) but because of his excellence, which immediately set him apart from the rest of the group. Endowed with a countertenor voice (the highest range among men) capable of catching excessively high notes, he delivered a performance as delicate as it was powerful. With its false airs of innocent pop balladry, the song surprises with airy operatic swerves before its frenetic grand finale with techno accents. The almost three minutes of condensed pop opera gave him time to demonstrate the quality of his vocal technique. “Wasted Love,” which he co-wrote and co-composed, evokes a drifting love into which his protagonist throws himself, leading him to his doom. This is his first and only recorded track to date. JJ sings “Wasted Love.” JJ —the stage name he chose for himself after being nicknamed by his friends — was born in Vienna in 2001, to a mother from the Philippines, a cook by trade, and an Austrian father who works as an IT specialist. He grew up in Dubai before returning to his hometown in 2016. Eurovision was not his first singing competition. In 2020, he took part in the English version of theThe Voice,joiningWill.i.am's team, before finishing, the following year, among the finalists of the Austrian showStarmania. At the same time, he won over classical music fans by performing supporting roles at the Vienna Opera. He honed his techniques at the MUK, Vienna's demanding private art and music university, while drawing inspiration from his role models, the immense sopranos Maria Callas, Montserrat Caballé andAnna Netrebko, along with Whitney Houston andMariah Carey. \"What a success! What a voice! What a show!\" said Austrian PresidentAlexander Van der Bellenon X. “Dear JJ, congratulations on your brilliant first place at the Eurovision Song Contest. All of Austria is delighted!” This was Austria's third victory, afterUdo Jürgens, winner in 1966 who performed “Merci, Chérie,” and thenConchita Wurst, in 2014, with “Rise Like a Phoenix.” The latter took JJ under her wing. “When JJ sings, it's like the clocks stop ticking,” she commented to AFP, emphasizing how \"impressive\" the performer is. In the meantime, JJ will have to forgo the week off he had planned for himself to recover from this adventure, he confided after his victory. On the agenda: weeks of writing and recording his first EP. Plus he's already thinking about hosting Eurovision in Austria next year. If possible in the capital, he asks, as his boyfriend lives there, which would enable him “to have practical accommodation.” Originally published in Vanity Fair France.

    "title": "Cannes Film Festival: Lacoste Celebrates Cédric Jimenez’s ‘Chien 51’",
    "article_text": "This year’s Cannes Film Festival has a very special guest: a crocodile known the world over. But Lacoste, a brand with close ties to both actors and singers, wasn’t there to throw yet another party. Instead, the evening marked Lacoste’s entry into the world of film production, with a first feature film expected this autumn:Chien 51,byCédric Jimenez.Its dazzling cast includesAdèle Exarchopoulos,Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi,Louis Garrel,Artus,andStéphane Bak.Though this adaptation ofLaurent Gaudé’s novel was not presented at Cannes, its announcement was celebrated as one does at Cannes: late into the night. “Lacoste and cinema are nothing new. We appear in numerous works, and the biggest names in world cinema have worn us and continue to do so, both onscreen and in their lives—Steve McQueen,Clint Eastwood,Audrey Hepburn,Adrien Brody,etc.,” Lacoste CEOThierry GuiberttoldVanity FairFrance a few hours before the event. He worked closely with producerHugo Sélignacon the project. “As coproducer, we’re making a financial contribution to the film. Lacoste will be present inChien 51through a cocreated scene, in which we imagine how the brand might appear in the dystopian world envisioned in the film,” said Jimenez, who posed with the entire cast at the spectacular photo-call set up for the occasion. The bubblyJameela Jamil,who has known Lacoste well for years, was thrilled by the brand’s new enterprise: “You’ve got to be kidding! It’s a shame I’m rubbish at tennis,” she joked toVanity Fair.Pelagia Kolotouros,Lacoste’s artistic director, was excited as well: “The crocodile never stops!Chien 51is a film that particularly touches me, because it mixes nostalgia and futurism. And Adèle is an extraordinary muse, with whom we’re going to do great things in the future.” The Lacoste party for the cast of Cédric Jimenez’sChien 51,held at the Cannes Film Festival.

    "title": "Ro Khanna Really Believes “Blue MAGA” Can Save the Dems—and Steve Bannon Loves It",
    "article_text": "The day after Donald Trumpbecomes presidentof theUnited Statesfor thesecond time, I’m in a cramped booth in the back of Pete’s Diner, a greasy spoon inWashington, DC, experiencing the slow onset shock of aworld turned to absolute shit. The future is a gaping void; the past a mushroom cloud. I’ve spent the previous morning in the bitter cold, fording rivers of guffawing frat boys,MAGA-­hatted blonds in teetering heels, gaggles of acid-washed biker retirees, and street merchants hawking bootleg Trump T-shirts by the hundreds. In the distance, a man carols incessantly:They’re eating the dogs! They’re eating thecats! In despair, I look across the table for a shred ofhopeand find the 48-year-old Democrat of the 17th Congressional District of California, Ro Khanna, nursing a weak cup of coffee as a 14-degree breeze blows through the jangling front door. Twenty-four hours earlier, Khanna had watched Trump take the oath of office in front of Abraham Lincoln’s Bible. His eye fell on the figure of Barack Obama, one of Khanna’spolitical heroes, whomhe’d first campaigned for as a college student in 1996, now a shrunken idol froma bygone era. “I thought that when he won in 2008, he had centereda new generation,” Khanna laments. “A multiracial America, a vision of new dynamic leaders. And seeing him on the side of that stage, almost as a figure pushed aside, and watching Trump centered, was disheartening.” Obama, Khanna says, “was the protagonist in my story.” Today Khanna’s professional obligation, in this blizzard of shit, is to shovel cheerfully. And Khanna is nothing if not professional. “I mean, this is an opportunity for rebirth,” he insists. “Crisis is a time for renewal, revitalization, new leadership. And I think that that is the opportunity we have as Democrats.” “We had people who have sacrificed so much for 250 years of American democracy. We’re not going to lose democracy for one person named Donald Trump.” From the vantage of Tuesday, January 21, this “opportunity” is downright laughable. And in the weeks ahead, asDemocratic leadersjaw emptyplatitudes like animatronic figuresin a museum to theirdead party, it won’t get much funnier. For Khanna the moment offers personal opportunity—the long, lonely chance to present himself as a newDemocratic hope, jostling for attention with Gavin Newsom, John Fetterman, Chris Murphy, Alexandria Ocasio-​Cortez, and a bunch of otherstrivers on TikTok,podcasts, op-ed columns, andcable TVin the jump ball for the party’s future. Khanna’s version of what went wrong will soon become conventional wisdom: Democrats went “too far” on social issues, putting theDEIcartbefore the economic horse. Joe Bidenclung to power too longand Kamala Harris ran aweak campaignshort onvision, he tells me. Trump, he will conclude, did the party a favor by delegitimizing itsfailed leadership. “There is no Democratic party leader,” he observes. “Who’s the leader? There’s got to be a ferocious battle with the establishment. This is not ‘Kumbaya, let’s all get along.’ This is ‘You screwed up and you betrayed the voters.’ ” A desperate situation! To his credit, Khanna has been preparing for this moment for years, doggedly selling a left-winganswertoMAGA populismthat he has dubbed“progressive capitalism,”or more recently,“economic patriotism”(or sometimes, half-jokingly, “blue MAGA”). Since 2016,Khanna has made repeated visits to MAGA districtslike Warren, Ohio, and Johnstown, Pennsylvania, to field-test his big idea: investing billions of federal dollars in American tech and steel companies to build new factories and create jobs in middle America, withouttrade warsand demagoguery. Democrats, Khanna argues, need to offer “a bold economic transformation of rebuilding this country, rebuilding our industrial base, using technology to have massive advances in society—those are all things that we didn’t do, and we didn’t have a policy, we didn’t have the grand vision.” Khanna is anunlikely populist: His California district covers Silicon Valley and includes many of themost powerful tech companiesin the world,including Apple and Nvidia. As Democrats’ self-styled tech whisperer, he advertises his friendships with Elon Musk and Marc Andreessen, and breaks with party orthodoxy on issues important totech bros like “free speech,”the civic value of X.com, the right of TikTok to operate in the US, and the virtues of Bitcoin. At Pete’s Diner he offers a generous interpretation ofMusk’s sure-seemed-like-a-Nazi saluteat a Trump rally. “It’s a combination of making clear that any gesture like that is something to be avoided,” says Khanna, a trained lawyer, “while also giving people the benefit of the doubt about what they’re saying they’re doing.” Khanna has unlikely fans on the right,most famously Steve Bannon, one of Trumpism’s primary architects, who singles Khanna out as a favorite Democrat who speaks the same populist language that he does. “Man, what an uphill fight he’s got,” Bannon said on hisWar Roompodcastafter Khanna became the sole Democrat to stand up and applaud when Trump spotlighted a 13-year-old boy with brain cancer during a congressional speech in March. The Friday after we meet at the diner, Khanna appears onReal Time With Bill Maherand getssteamrolledby the splenetic ESPN host Stephen A. Smith, who excoriates Democrats as out of touch and unable to compete in the spectacle-style politics of the Trump age. Khanna counters, “Do we have to have the celebrity president? Is it all about coolness?” Maher practically laughs him out of the studio: “That horse has left the barn,” he says sourly. For Khanna—and every other Democrat—the journey of a thousand miles begins with one step. As another icy breeze blows through the door, Khanna welcomes me on a listening tour of Western Pennsylvania and Milwaukee, where he will meetdisenfranchised workersand sell his big idea forbringing factories and jobs back to the Rust Belt—and hope they forget for a minute that he believes intrans rightsand DEI. “We’ve got to listen and persuade,” Khanna tells me. “And those are the two tenets of the rebirth of the modern Democratic Party.” And I will ride along with Khanna through the valley of the shadow of political death. I first met Khanna two years ago in Fremont, California, where one evening over a plate of biryani he explained his big idea. That year, he cosponsored the CHIPS and Science Act, a bill conceived under the first Trump administration butpassed with bipartisan supportand signed by President Joe Biden. The plan would seed Intel with almost $8 billion to build chip factories in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon instead of importing chips from Taiwan. Khanna showcased the CHIPS Act in his2022 bookProgressive Capitalism: How to Make Tech Work for All of Us. At the time, Khanna was critical of Governor Newsom,who was advertising Californiaas the left-wing answer to Governor Ron DeSantis’s“free state” of Florida, which Khanna found tone-deaf. Khanna took an intriguing stance: Rather than billboarding California as a liberal Shangri-la (which it most assuredly was not), Democrats should show more humility and focus on economic prosperity for the heartland. “It’s insensitive to the unique traditions, assets, and skills of people in other parts of the nation,” he said of Newsom’s California ballyhooing. “When I go to my wife’s hometown in Cleveland, if the Browns lose, people are depressed through Wednesday. They’re literally depressed. There’s a different level of attachment to place. I think that it comes off as out of touch to say that the whole nation should be California.” (Khanna later told me Newsom was unhappy with his critiques inVanity Fairfor that story, titled“Can Anyone Fix California?”) Now, on a Tuesday afternoon in late January, Khanna’s aide shuttles Khanna and me in a rented Jeep Compass along a Pennsylvania highway dotted with Trump signs, drooping American flags, gigantic roadside crucifixes, rusted-out bridges, and the grim visage of an abandoned steel mill on a leafless winter horizon. I point to a pickup truck with a 1776 sticker on the back of the cab. “Democrats have been accused of saying that1619 is when the country started, which is a little misreading,” muses Khanna, who is wearing the DC uniform of navy blue suit and crisp white shirt. From 1965 to 2025, he says, the story of America was the story of ever-growing diversity and pluralism. But people—Democrats—took it for granted. “If there is an assertion of nationalism, hearkening back to a nostalgic past, wouldn’t youexpectit?” he says. “I mean, were we just expecting that we just kind of sleep our way into becoming this perfect multiracial democracy and everyone would just applaud?” Johnstown, Pennsylvania, was a thriving steel town until themills moved to China in the 1980s. The population plummeted, and now the city is plagued by unemployment, low wages, and full-throated MAGA enthusiasm. Walmart has become the big employer. Last year Khannacosponsored the Modern Steel Act, which proposed to build next-generation steel plants here, complete with unions, to revive the town’s fortunes. At a Trump rally last August, local business leader and Trump donor Bill Polacek, whose manufacturing company thrives on contracts with the US government, railed against the idea, labeling it “green steel” to put the climate-change hex on it. “Two months ago we had a far-left liberal, a US representative from Congress, Ro Khanna, that came to our conservative town touting ‘green steel,’ ” he yelled. “That’s bullshit! Who the hell brought this far-left liberal from California to our town?” At least they were paying attention. Voter turnout in Johnstown reached 81 percent in 2024, the vast majority going to Trump. Hope for Khanna’s steel bill faded to black. That evening, Khanna and I drive to nearby Red’s Texas BBQ, a fluorescent-lit restaurant lined with gambling machines and a coin-operated claw game with arubber Trump head inside. Hisghoulish likenessis mashed against the plexiglass. As the co-owner, Tracy, takes Khanna’s order for a rack of ribs, her husband, Jimmy, comes by to ask if he’s a doctor, perhaps mistaking him for Sanjay Gupta from CNN. Khanna identifies himself as a congressman from California and leaps to defuse any embarrassment. “That’s a very good thing,” Khanna says cheerfully. “Indian Americans, when you go to different places, people think they could be a doctor, which is a positive impression.” He tells the couple he’s in town toinvestigate opening a new steel plant: “Do you think that would help?” “Yes,” Tracy says emphatically. “We need one. People need jobs. There’s not much left here.” Khanna says a new steel plant would help businesses like hers. Tracy says Khanna faces an uphill battle: “The thought process of people in Johnstown is if it’s notdirectlyhelping them, they don’t want nothing to do with it,” she laments. “This town is so stagnant. People are just okay with being okay.” Khanna asks for her best solution for bringing jobs back to Johnstown. “Casino,” she says flatly. “In the mall,” adds Jimmy. The gambling games blare in the background. “But a steel plant would help?” Khanna asks, hopefully. “Steel mill, a casino, some kind of water park,” says Tracy. “That would be huge,” says Jimmy. He enthusiastically describes a successful water park in a nearby town. Khanna gingerly wades into politics, asking what people hope Trump will do for them. “Not what he’s doing right now!” Tracy says. Khanna’s eyes light up. Over the weekend the administrationtemporarily freezes federal funds, making the Medicaid payment systemtemporarily inaccessible across many states, spurring panic. Tracy’s mother, we learn, is in the hospital with stage 4 cancer, and if she doesn’t haveMedicare and Medicaid, she’ll have to sell everything she owns. Her cost of living, which includes her late husband’s leftover debt, leaves her with $19 to spare each month. “And that’s if she follows a strict budget and doesn’t stop for a coffee or McDonald’s,” Tracy says. Tracy says she “absolutely” voted for Trump—“I’m not sad that I did”—and is looking forward to when he makes good on his no-tax-on-tipspromise. Waiters in the area make $2.83 an hour plus tips, she says, and barely eke out a living. Still, Trump is an imperfect instrument. “He doesn’t know how it feels to not be able to feed your family,” she says, suggesting that Trump could mail out another round ofstimulus checksto poor people, as he did during the pandemic, “to get a car, to get a job. ‘Here’s five grand, get yourself some furniture.’ Will it happen? Probably not.” Khanna asks whether she considered voting forVice President Kamala Harris, and Tracy says she was intrigued but found Harris “phony.” “I’m a pretty good judge of character,” she assures us. “How phony do you think I am?” asks Khanna, to laughter all around. “Really, honestly, good luck,” she tells him. We climb back into the Compass and Khanna reviews what we’ve learned. “Their eyes lit up with the steel, did you see that?” he says. “You saw what it meant to people in this community.” Tracy seemed more excited by the casino, I reply. “Yeah, that was sad,” he acknowledges. The whole exchange illustrates, Khanna believes, how Harris’s campaign message in 2024 wasdisconnected from working people. Instead of talking to the likes of Tracy, he says, “Kamala Harris was talking about ‘opportunity society’ so people can start start-ups. Like, does Tracy care about starting a start-up? I mean, come on.” Khanna says Tracy’s story proves that only eight days into Trump’s presidency, Democrats are already finding political openings. “She didn’t bring up trans rights,” he says. “She didn’t bring up LGBTQ rights. She didn’t bring up, ‘Oh, I don’t like what they’re teaching in our schools.’ ” The more Khanna thinks about it, the more he sees the proprietor of Red’s Texas BBQ as a political bellwether. “She shows why this country is absolutely winnable,” he says. “We just didn’t run a good campaign or she would have voted for Kamala. And I’m sure there are thousands of people like her. It reaffirms my faith in the country. That’s a voter we can easily win in ’26 and ’28 with the right message. It’s not that voters were wrong;wedid something wrong.” The next morningTrump suggests DEI is to blamefor afatal plane crash over the Potomacin Washington, as Khanna and I don hard hats and safety jackets to tour a factory of Höganäs, a Swedish company that produces metallurgical powders for manufacturing. The staff is largely white and working class, a rare union shop in a region of low-paying service jobs. An entry-level job at Höganäs pays about $24 an hour plus health care and a pension. Across town, the company operated by Trump donor Bill Polacek, who has broken at least two unionization attempts and festoons his warehouses with signs that say “God, Faith and Country,” reportedly pays some $18 an hour to entry-level welders. Turnover is rampant there, and Trump is wildly popular. But Höganäs is no different: Union officials estimate that around 80 percent of the company’s rank and file voted for Trump. The higher-ups argue politics with them every day. When they try debating staffers over Trump’s lies, “they just get angry with you,” says Gerald Lee, recording secretary for USW Local 2632.Joe Rogan is the common source of news. “His podcast runs heavy in this area,” Lee says. Trump’sprolonged attack on transgender peopleworked in Johnstown, as it did across all of the Midwestern states formerly known as the blue wall. “We still have employees that think a bearded lady in a sundress is going to walk into the girl’s bathroom,” says Lee. Democratic state representative Frank Burns, or Far-Left Frank as some locals call him, says people feared thatdroves of immigrantswould show up and work for less than $18 an hour and steal their jobs. Johnstown has almost no immigrants. “You factor in the cultural stuff on top of that, the transsexual stuff in sports,” Burns says, “it’s just beyond the comprehension of the average person. Like, where are we going as a country?” At a luncheon afterward, ­Khanna meets with local union leaders in a ­dreary café across from a park where drug addicts gather at night. ­Baseball-hatted dudes from the International Association of Heat and Frost Insulators and Allied Workers and the Iron Workers Local Union No. 3 receive theYale-educatedDemocrat from California with curiosity and politeness, maybe a touch of awe because he’s on TV a lot. “I represent Silicon Valley,” begins Khanna’s pitch, “and I’ve been passionate about figuring out how we reindustrialize our country. The reality, as all of you know, is for the last 50 years, we basically had industry after industry shift offshore. We lost steel. You guys know more than I do that we’ve made, in Western Pennsylvania, more steel than Japan and Germany combined. We lost aluminum. We lost shipbuilding. We don’t make enough of the drugs that we buy at CVS or Walgreens. A lot of thepill manufacturing has gone offshore. China announced last week that they have a $1 trillion trade surplus. That means they’re selling a trillion dollars more to places like the United States, and we’re buying from them while the jobs arethere. “Now, in my district,” he continues, “we’ve got $12 trillion of wealth and technology—Google, Apple, Nvidia, a lot of the new tech companies. But you can’t build a nation without manufacturing. You can’t be a strong country and a secure country without a strong industrial base. So I call it a new economic patriotism.” Khanna pivots to the tale of Tracy, whose restaurant everyone is familiar with, asking why her ailing mother barely scrapes by every month “in a country where we’re producing $12 trillion in one district?” The big idea laid out, Khanna acknowledges an obvious problem: The tech companies—“all my guys,” he says—were lined up beside Trump only days earlier. “Would they be willing to come to Johns­town?” a woman asks hopefully. “I’m trying,” replies Khanna, reminding them that under the Obama administration,Musk took a $465 million federal loanto support a Tesla plant in Fremont, California, and the administration failed to demand labor neutrality as part of the deal, which would have allowed for unions. Despite what everyone may have heard on Fox News, Khanna says, the government is not the enemy. “Fifty years we’ve been hearing that,” he says, growing stern. “Let me just be blunt. We’re arguing about what’s going to happen with trans kids, we’re arguing about deporting criminals—all BS. All BS in terms of whether we’re going to beat China or not.” It all sounds good on paper. Another union official wonders how Khanna plans to slowTrump’s bulldozing of DC, which appears, on day eight, unstoppable. Khanna attempts spine-straightening rhetoric. “We had people in this country scale the cliffs of Normandy,” he says, pacing. “We had John Lewis beaten on the Edmund Pettus Bridge. We had people who have sacrificed so much for 250 years of American democracy. We’re not going to lose democracy for one person named Donald Trump. I have more confidence in the American public.” Khanna hangs his hopes on Tracy. “That confidence was restored last night when I talked to Tracy,” Khanna says. “She voted for Trump, but these cuts [to Medicare], she said, ‘It’s not why I voted for him. I voted for him because I didn’t want a tax on tips.… I voted for him because the Democratic Party has ignored rural America for too long. I didn’t think he was going to stop the basic services on which we depend.’ ” Bowing to public pressure, the government rescinds the freeze, and within 48 hours the Medicaid system switches back on. “What does that tell me?” asks Khanna. “That when people in this country speak out, we still have an enormous amount of power.” “Here’s the good news,” Khanna concludes. “Trump is a lame duck. In two years, we’re going to start running for the future.” Khanna and I sat down to a buffet of soggy hamburgers and fries. At the start of our tour, Khanna makes the bold prediction that Trump will be a footnote in American history. “He’s a passing moment in the American story that will be footnoted, with a little deeper footnote,” he’d told me. “Now he’s going to be Andrew Jackson instead of just inconsequential. But that’s not the American narrative.” Trump’s talk of American revival is appealing, Khanna admits, an echo of John F. Kennedy and Obama, “but I think he’s linking all of that with his MAGA base, which wants to move back to an America prior to the 1965 immigration act, which allowed my parents to come to the United States.” That America, he is quick to note, “excludes me.” Khanna faces rooms ofworking-class white menwith admirable courage. It helps that he talks in the nasal lilt of a native Pennsylvanian, his flattened vowels lending an air of approachability. He sells his biography as evidence of his essential Americanness: His father, a chemical engineer, and mother, a substitute teacher, moved to the states from Punjab, India, in the 1970s and raised Khanna in suburban Bucks County. He played Little League baseball (poorly, he says) and became valedictorian at his high school, class of 1994. He jumped on the conveyor belt to success: an economics degree from the University of Chicago, a law degree from Yale, a clerkship with a judge in Arkansas, a move to Silicon Valley in 2003, where he landed at Munger, Tolles & Olson, focusing on litigation. In 2004 he quit to work for John Kerry’s campaign, and to run for California’s 12th Congressional District on an antiwar platform against incumbent Tom Lantos, a Holocaust survivor. He lost by 46 points. Khanna thinks of himself as a progressive’s answer to JD Vance—an ambitious and intellectual outsider from a marginalized background. Khanna’s defining moment arrived in 2009. He was teaching economics at Stanford when Nancy Pelosi recommended him for a job in the Obama administration. Khanna imagined himself jetting to Brussels and focusing on international trade as head of the Commerce Department. Instead he was assigned domestic policy and got a grand tour of Warren, Ohio. His aha moment was when he heard about 13 people in Warren who had taken their own lives in the wake of factory closings. “It had an emotional impact,” he says to me. In2012 Khanna wrote his first book,Entrepreneurial Nation: Why Manufacturing Is Still Key to America’s Future,and reached out to a rising tech pioneer for a blurb. Elon Musk followed through, calling Khanna a “leading thinker.” “The unconventional ideas in this book chart the path America can take to lead the world for years to come,” enthused the man who was nowhacking the federal government. Khanna says he recognized Musk’s role in theelectric vehicle revolution, and “wanted to see how wenotlose him as part of the Democratic coalition,” he recalls. “And he knew I disagreed with him on labor issues, but we would have conversations.” In 2014 Khanna ran for office again, this time in the 17th District of California against incumbent Democrat Mike Honda. Pelosi backed Honda in the primary and Khanna lost again. A friend of Khanna’s put it to him straight: “He says, ‘Look, you’re almost 40 years old, you’re not married, you’re in debt, you’ve lost twice,’ ” Khanna recalls. “ ‘What are you going to do with your life?’ That was a wake-up call.” For years Khanna had been dating a woman named Ritu Ahuja, the daughter of a successful Indian American automotive-parts supplier from northeast Ohio. She was glamorous, a Georgetown grad with a master’s degree in strategic communications from Columbia. In 2015 Ahuja made one of her few campaign appearances as a political partner when she stood on a stage at a campaign stop in Santa Clara and recalled Khanna’s entreaties to marry him while dating on and off for eight years. She had rejected him twice but finally said yes on the cusp of Khanna’s third run for Congress, against Honda again. She compared her fiancé’s dogged romantic efforts to his political career. “Truly, the man does not give up when something matters to him,” she said. Khanna initially supported Hillary Clinton as the Democratic nominee in 2016 but shocked his own campaign staff by switching mid-primary to Bernie Sanders. Some congressional colleagues viewed Khanna as an opportunist, but Khanna says he realized that he,like Sanders, was an outsider in the party. Pelosi had endorsed Honda against him again, making clear Khanna wasn’t part of the “club in California and the machine politics.” “Bernie was just this outsider who was taking on the system, saying you’ve got to make way for more voices,” he says. “That was the emotional draw. And his advocacy for Medicare for All, which I was supporting.” Khanna ran to the left of Honda and won the congressional seat. ­Subsequently, Sanders became Khanna’s mentor, later asking Khanna to co-chair his 2020presidential campaign. Had it not been for the fateful job at Commerce and meeting Sanders, says Khanna, “my life could have easily gone a different way, into me being a guy who would have just been a voice for globalization and tech wealth.” Khanna thinks of himself as a progressive’s answer to JD Vance—an ambitious and intellectual outsider from a marginalized background who earned a law degree from Yale, migrated to Silicon Valley to seek his financial and political fortune, and authored books to help define his public profile (though Vance’s book sold vastly more copies).“We followed each other for many years,” he says of Vance. “We’ve both seen the pinnacles of Silicon Valley, and he’s drawn from that techno-libertarianism of tearing down government, up by the bootstraps. Mine is much more focused on a fair social compact. Government needs to have a role in providing people with health care and education. So we’ve taken very different visions of the kind of America we want.” The two first met at a tech conference hosted by AOL cofounder Steve Case and later went on a bus tour of Ohio alongside then representative Tim Ryan.The New York Timesdubbed it a “Rust Belt safari.” Khanna and Ahuja both know Usha Vance, who had also worked at Munger, Tolles & Olson. When the Vances first moved to Washington, Usha and Ritu connected to talk about life in the Beltway. I ask Khanna: What must an educated second-generation Indian American woman think of herwhite husband’s immigrant bashing? Khanna, citing personal civility, sidesteps the question and turns the hose on JD: “I think his 22-year-old self, the JD Vance who was at Yale Law School and who married Usha Vance, would be horrified,” he says. “What would he think of what JD Vance has become? “He’s obviously not George Wallace, but I think about George Wallace and how he adopted certain positions because of pure political opportunism, not because of ideology,” continues Khanna, referring to theracist demagogue and Alabama governor who ran for presidentmultiple times in the 1960s and ’70s. “What Vance said about ‘cat ladies’ and the role of women in American society, saying Haitian immigrants are eating cats and dogs—the willingness to instill fear and division for the sake of power is a pretty unoriginal tale. It’s a pretty tried-and-true way of advancing yourself. And he’s doing that.” In February Khanna called outVance for defending a DOGE stafferwho had resigned after a racist post about Indian immigrants came to light: “Are you going to tell him to apologize for saying ‘Normalize Indian hate’ before this rehire?” Khanna tweeted at Vance. “Just asking for the sake of both of our kids.” Khanna drew an angry rebuke from Vance: “For the sake of both of our kids? Grow up,” Vance shot back. “Racist trolls on the internet, while offensive, don’t threaten my kids. You know what does? A culture that denies grace to people who make mistakes. A culture that encourages congressmen to act like whiny children.” “I cannot overstate how much I loathe this emotional blackmail pretending to be concern,” Vance added. Sensing he’d hit a nerve, Khanna scheduled a big speech for April, “Defense of the Constitution and University,” choosing Yale Law School as the backdrop against which to road test some soaring rhetoric and take potshots at a certain elegiac hillbilly, comparing him to other historical monsters: “As Stephen Kotkin observed in his study of Stalin,” said Khanna, “strongmen do not fear recessions or even failed wars as much as they fear the university.” (“Yawn” a Vance spokesman responded in the press.) Khanna is not a natural pugilist. When I suggest he might be too mild-mannered for this gig, Khanna gets defensive, invoking his maternal grandfather, Amarnath Vidyalankar, who fought for Indian independence alongside Mahatma Gandhi and was imprisoned for two years. Khanna says he comes from a “maverick” legacy. “I don’t have to walk in and suck up all the oxygen,” he tells me. “I can listen. People often describe me as a listener, right? Maybe, after the bombast, the ugliness of what’s going on, the simple chance of embodying American decency, and kindness, and empathy, and listening, and substance, which is also a strain in the American story, right? For every Donald Trump character, there are also those characters. And our country is so beautiful and diverse, and there’s room for all, and maybe people are drawn to it.” After Khanna got poleaxed by Stephen A. Smith on Bill Maher’s show in January, he received a note from the actor Jesse Eisenberg, who had also appeared on the panel and said the exchange “felt emblematic of this moment, but also every moment when the thoughtful person is drowned out by the loud person.” Not that Khanna isn’t trying to adapt. In February he went after Musk on X over the unchecked slash and burn of the federal government, prompting Musk to snap back, “Don’t be a dick.” Khanna turned the exchange into aTikTok video promising to be “the biggest dick in Congress”if transparency isn’t forthcoming. I ask about the exchange, and Khanna again invokes Tracy in Johnstown. By endangering her mother’s health care, he says, Musk is giving Democrats a message they can run on. “I can already imagine the bumper sticker in 2026,” he tells me. “ ‘Don’t fire veterans and don’t take away Medicaid.’ ” It’s a very long bumper sticker, I tell him. We’re somewhere between Milwaukee and Chicago when the subject of Bannon first comes up. The Rasputin of the far right went to prison in 2024 for refusing to testify before Congress about his role in the January 6 insurrection. By the time Khanna and I are talking, he’s back on top,gabbing with Newsom on Newsom’s podcast, giving along interview to Ross DouthatofThe New York Times,critiquing the failures of Democrats,attacking Musk, espousing the importance of reviving American industry—and sounding very much like Khanna. I’ve known Bannon since he was alawyer in Hollywood, trading in gossip about players like Mike Ovitz and Ron Burkle, the California grocery store magnate and old pal of Clinton. Bannon had a financial stake inSeinfeldand earned residuals from the show before becoming a populist firebrand. I text Bannon to say I’m with Khanna, and he instantly shoots back: “He’s a rock star!” Khanna is delighted when I read the text and jokes that Bannon might want to endorse him in his next race. “He thinks that the economic patriotism [idea] I have can be a successful vision for our party,” surmises Khanna. “Having an Indian American son of immigrants talking about why we need steel in Johnstown—I mean, that’s probably what intrigues people like Bannon. Here’s a Stanford econ grad, Indian American guy, saying, ‘Boy, those politicians were dumb to take away the industrial base.’ And yeah, we’ve got to rebuild it, and nations matter, and you can’t just have unlimited free flow of global capital.” It all makes perfect sense. Two weeks later I meet with Bannon on the eighth floor of the Pierre Hotel in Manhattan, where he’s padding around in stocking feet and his signature rumpled field-general chic, long hair greased back, belly hanging out, looking like a founding father after a weekend ayahuasca trip. Khanna’s “economic patriotism” motif, Bannon declares, “is stealing our shit! Yeah, he’s put a new title on it.… He’s trying to take Make America Great Again and put even more stars and stripes on it.” Bannon is all in on Khanna’s vision of marrying Silicon Valley wealth to middle-American industry, “butthe broligarchs will never do it. They’re in the algorithm business.” As Bannon envisions it, the battle for the future is between the tech leaders in Khanna’s district who want to put computer chips in the heads of their customers and plug them into artificial intelligence (the “transhumanists,” he calls them) and the normal, analog, non-billionaire class he says he’s fighting for (“I’m on Team Homo Sapiens”).Bannon split with Musk over the issue of H-1B visas, which allows Silicon Valley companies to import skilled engineers from India and China, and which Khanna and Musk both support. When Vivek Ramaswamy, Musk’s would-be partner in DOGE, said H-1B visas are necessary because American workers are mediocre, he exposed the canyon between Bannon’s movement and the tech oligarchs with whom Trump has allied himself. Bannon refers to these Indian engineers in Silicon Valley as “indentured servants.” “I think it’s terrible what we do with these Indian kids,” he says. “I mean, it’s a fucking ghetto there, but the oligarchs love it. [They] love the fact these guys live six to a two bedroom in Silicon Valley because they’re working 20 fucking hours a day at these companies.” I ask Bannon to advise Khanna on how he can succeed politically. “He needs a rally point,” Bannon says. “And that rally point is to tell Dems they were lied to by the Democratic establishment. ‘Yeah, you’ve been crushed. Yeah, you were sold a false narrative.’ That’s why, right now, as hard as we had it, [Democrats] have it harder. They think they were lied to.” Khanna has a tough road ahead, Bannon says, because Democrats can’t credibly talk to the working class: “Populism is not easy,” he says. “You have to really believe it. Nobody in your party believes it.” “I think the reason he’s a breath of fresh air is he’s a decent guy,” Bannon concludes. “He’s not one of these know-it-alls on MSNBC telling you you’re bad, you’re evil, you’re stupid. But he needs critical mass and wins. Process and content.” I mention Khanna’s theory that rebuilding industry in MAGA country might make people stop hating on immigrants and trans people, the stuff Trump and Bannon exploited for years to build the MAGA following. “Theoretically, that might be true,” he snaps, “but it’s also a masturbatory fantasy. First off, you have to be in power, which you’re not.” The easier solution? For Khanna to switch to the Republican Party and go full MAGA—which Bannon predicts Khanna will do within 18 months. “He’ll eventually be a Republican,” he says. “Of course he will! He’s out there with the oligarchs, they’re all right-wingers now.” I can practically see Bannon’s tail wagging. Bannon aims to recruit both Khanna andPennsylvania senator John Fetterman to join the MAGA ranks.“They’re my top two targets,” he declares. “You understand if we flip Fetterman and Ro Khanna, [Democrats] got nothing? They have no intellectual fire. My top target in ’16 was Tulsi Gabbard. Ro needs a year in the wilderness to see how hard it is to change the Democratic apparatus.” Considering reports of Fetterman’s erratic and tempestuous behavior behind the scenes, he may be the ripest of Bannon’s targets. The big difference between Khanna’s brand of populism and Bannon’s version, I am at pains to point out, is that Khanna envisions a multiracial society and nota white nationalist autocracy. Bannon comes back with the familiar argument thatMAGA made big inroadswith Black and Hispanic voters in 2024, adding, for good measure, “I’m the chairman of the Hindu Republican Society,” misremembering the actual name of the group, Republican Hindu Coalition. Bannon the Cynic views people as transactional. As far as he’s concerned, Khanna—whose name Bannon repeatedly mispronounces asKuh-hawna—could help fill MAGA’s quota of nonwhites. “In the populist-nationalist movement,” he suggests, Khanna “could be the guy that actually brings in the South Asians. And it’s open. We want it.… I would love to be able to convert him.” (A week laterBannon complicates plans when he makes a Nazi-like gestureat the Conservative Political Action Conference.) Bannon reveals that he’s exchanged a few texts with Khanna, advising him, “First, you gotta go back to your fucking district and take care of those goddamn oligarchs you’ve loosed on the world.” Before I depart, I show Bannon the social media exchange in which Khanna promises Musk he’ll be “the biggest dick in Congress.” “That’s not bad, it’s a start,” says Bannon. “You gotta start somewhere.” The bromance of Khanna and Bannon highlights an uncomfortable truth: The success of Trumpism has so utterly reshaped American political reality that Democrats, if they are ever to win again, must absorb its cruel lessons. Khanna, in effect, is promising a kinder, gentler version of Trumpism—“blue MAGA,” as Khanna had joked. Maybe he’ll convince Bannon to flip to his side, he jokes, but it’s not that funny. “I think that he is right,” Khanna admits after I read him Bannon’s political advice. “You have to be willing to take the fight to the establishment with no mercy. It can’t be Pollyannaish. ‘The establishment screwed you.’ In that, I totally agree with him.” Looking back,2016 was a world-historic fork in the road. Democrats may have had a chance to cut Trump off at the pass by nominating thepopulist insurgent Sanders for president, but the establishment standard-bearer also offered the irresistible prospect of becoming the first woman president. The what-if grows starker in the rearview. “I think the Democratic Party in 2016 wouldn’t have allowed me to be a populist,” muses Khanna. “I couldn’t have smashed the Democratic Party myself, but Bannon and Trump did it for us, and there’s a rebirth and it’s a free-for-all.” I joke to Khanna that he should rebrand himself “Bro Khanna” andstart drinking protein shakes, try selling himself to thetrad white males who support Trump. “I don’t think that the party wins by becoming Trump-like,” he says, “by dressing like Trump, by mimicking Trump’s cursing, by mimicking Trump’s crudeness. Why would we? Why would that be authentic? I mean, we win by being the opposite.” Khanna’s cardinal faith is that pure economics can beat culture-war issues—with a dose of sympathy for white fragility. “They were in classes where they were told the future is female,” Khanna observes of aggrieved white males in America. “They feel that people don’t realize how hard it is for them, and they don’t feel seen or heard, and so our message to them shouldn’t be, you know, ‘It’s time to reassert manliness in American society at the expense of women.’ Our message to them should be, ‘We see that a declining economy where we offshored all these jobs, where we let wealth pile up in a few places, has left you without real economic opportunity.’ ” Khanna, like every other Democrat, is surfing a fast-moving political wave, trying to keep his balance amid thedaily shocks of the Trump administration. In the course of reporting this story,Trump launches a global trade war, heralding a “renaissance” of American industrialization, extracting a promise of $100 billion innew US manufacturing from Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC. On the surface it’s the kind of development Khanna would otherwise support, given his passion for rebuilding industry. “He has the same aim but the wrong means,” he says of Trump. “It’s not going to work. I just disagree with how he’s doing it.” In March, whenTrump threatens to defund the CHIPS Act, I sense the walls closing in on Khanna’s populism. Frustrated, Khanna texts me: “Trump beckons FOREIGN firms instead of building AMERICAN CAPACITY … By gutting CHIPS, Trump is not giving American industry any chance to develop.” Khanna again trains his fire on Vance, whose home state ofOhio could now lose a planned Intel facilityprojected to create some 10,000 new jobs. “How can you be for rebuilding the industrial base and watch that disappear?” he asks, suggesting Vance will be politically damaged when he runs for president in 2028 (if any of it is remembered). In the spring Khanna starts a series of rallies in Republican districts in California, focusing on veterans and federal workers hurt by DOGE cuts, pulling larger-than-usual crowds with a populist “benefits over billionaires” message, allying himself with the barnstorming Bernie Sanders and AOC. “I see it as the wing with the most energy,” says ­Khanna of the progressives. “It’s a vindication tour for Bernie. ‘You should have listened to me.’ ” Even when Trump’sapproval rating finally takes a dipbelow 40 percent in April, Khanna and the Democrats are still looking for an argument, an opening, a wedge, a foot in the door, a breeze at their backs, momentum of any kind. They need a fresh face, a new voice. Khanna? Well, nobody looks possible until one day they do. See also: Trump. “What wakes up the American people?” Khanna asks. “I understand that there are things that the government can do more efficiently, but Democratic projects are hard. It’s hard to get people to do things, to build things for the economy. It’s a hard thing.” A lot of people believeTrumpism is here to stay, that America is on the slow glide to fascism. Or the fast glide. Maybe we’re already there. Or maybe Trump’s tariff gambit will work and Democrats will look like obstructionist fools in the grand scheme of history. “Isn’t that the exhilarating part of American democracy?” Khanna says. “It’s that we don’t know. We don’t know whether my ideas are going to work, or connect, but that’s the process.” On my flight home from California, where I had toured Khanna’s home turf of Silicon Valley, I watchGary Oldman portray Winston Churchillin the 2017 filmDarkest Hour.Director Joe Wright’s Churchill, facing impossible odds and no good options against the Nazi threat, finds his voice, and his spine, by sounding out opinions from regular folks riding the London Tube, inspiring the “We Shall Fight on the Beaches” speech to Parliament. The movie ends on a stark quote: “Success is not final, failure is not fatal. It is the courage to continue that counts.” In April I call Tracy in Johnstown to ask how her mother is doing and whether Trump is helping her cause. “Not really, no,” she tells me. “I just feel like there was a bunch of promises made that are just not being addressed. ‘This will change. That will change.’ I understand that it’s only been since January, but there’s nothing changing.” Operating costs for Red’s Texas BBQ have gone up 40 percent in the past year, she says. “I can’t blame it on Trump, because he wasn’t in office,” Tracy says, “but he’s claiming so much that he’s gonna fix. I know it’s not gonna happen overnight, but I just don’t see anything happening. I just don’t see anything moving.” Tracy’s mother developed pneumonia after Khanna and I left town and had to be flown to a hospital in Pittsburgh. The bill for the 20-minute helicopter ride was $60,000. “Imagine if she didn’t have insurance,” Tracy says. Tracy worries about it “absolutely every day.” I ask Tracy whether Democrats could ever break through in Johnstown. She compares working-class voters to pit bulls. “So, pit bulls have a bad name, just because they’re pit bulls,” she says. “But if you get a pit bull and you love it, and you nurture it, you raise it, and you put care and concern into it, it’ll be the best, most loyal dog you’ve ever had.” Tracy says Khanna’s attention made an impression on her. She wasn’t the only one in Johnstown who told me that. “He came all the way from California, here to this little hole in the wall, to a place that is privately owned, instead of going to Applebee’s,” she says. “That was promising. Definitely.” It’s a start. This story has been updated. Ro Khanna Really Believes“Blue MAGA” Can Save the Dems—and Steve Bannon Loves It Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years.

    "title": "Nicole Kidman Calls for Change in Cannes: “We Need to Give Women Better Roles…So Please Write Them”",
    "article_text": "To attend the Kering Women in Motion Awards in Cannes—one of the most glamorous, starry black-tie dinners at a film festival full of them—is to wonder, at least initially, who’s surrounding you. As I ascended the steps toward the banquet hall, overlooking the Croisette in the city’s hilly old town at Place de la Castre, dozens of cameras started snapping in my face. Surely they could not have been for me—and indeed they were not. It took a few too many seconds for me to realize I was arriving right behindCharli XCX. So it goes as the festival’s opening weekend draws to a close—the Grammy-winning pop artist has been a fixture at this year’s Cannes, and before long was mingling withNicole Kidman,the night’s big honoree. As one got a little deeper into the room, it was instantly stacked with big names. The main-competition jury, led byJuliette Binocheand featuring American starsHalle BerryandJeremy Strong,held much of the attention, as did festival fixtures likeJulianne MooreandIsabelle Huppert,recent Cannes prize-winning filmmakersJulia DucournauandCoralie Fargeat,and other luminaries such asNaomi AckieandPaul Mescal.I saw a few emotional reunions take place:Anora’s Oscar-winning producerSamantha QuanhuggedMark Eydelshteyn,a breakout star of that film, whilePatrick Schwarzeneggercaught up with hisWhite LotuscostarCharlotte Le Bon. Halle Berry AlongsideMarianna Brennand,director of the terrific Brazilian filmManasand recipient of the Emerging Talent Award, Kidman was recognized on Sunday night for her efforts to increase the prominence of women in cinema. She was introduced by the festival’s longtime general delegate,Thierry Frémaux,who movingly spoke about Kidman’s decades-long relationship with the festival, highlighting the rousing opening night screening ofMoulin Rouge!nearly 25 years ago—and the raucous party that followed. (“Enough!” Kidman playfully shouted midway through his speech, as he hinted at her wild side.) When Kidman took the stage, she spoke about making good on her commitment to work regularly with female filmmakers—and urged those listening to push harder going forward. “We need to give women better roles, particularly as they get older, so please write them—we are here and we can prove to you that we will make money for you,” Kidman said in her acceptance speech. She then thanked Kering’s chairman and CEO,François-Henri Pinault,and his wife, Oscar nomineeSalma Hayek,for their support, before concluding, “I’m very, very happy that I just get to be an advocate and to get to uphold and continue to be a worker bee, as I call myself, doing the work that’s necessary to change cinema and storytelling, and to keep this world alive and buzzing.” Patrick Schwarzenegger and Charlotte Le Bon Given that Kering’s ceremony took place smack in the middle of the festival, everyone was eager to gossip. My table near the front of the stage included Academy presidentJanet Yang,European Film Award–winning French actorClotilde Courau,and several filmmakers; during the cocktail hour that preceded the seated dinner, I chatted with fellow journalists, jury members, and other festival attendees. Of the favorites so far, the film that came up most often wasNouvelle Vague,Richard Linklater’s homage to the French New Wave that depicts the making of Jean-Luc Godard’sBreathless.Americans in the room loved it, but more importantly, so did several French film-industry members whose perspective I wasn’t sure about, given that the movie was made by an American and is awash in sweet reverence. “I loved it,” Courau told me, adding that she felt it could serve as a valuable education for younger artists in France. “And I didn’t know Jean Seberg came [intoBreathless] as such a big star. We didn’t all know that.” There was much anticipation forDucournau’sAlpha,which is premiering Monday night; one producer told me he feared that some might prematurely have it out for the film, as Ducournau’s previous movie, the body-horror extravaganzaTitane,was a controversial Palme d’Or winner. And there was much talk aroundJennifer Lawrence’s extraordinary performanceinDie, My Love,even as I heard about mixed feelings toward the movie overall. Several individuals at the event from around the world expressed shock at the size and speed ofMubi’s acquisitionof the film, which indicates high awards hopes from the studio. As to who might be the Palme front-runner so far? I tried polling multiple jury members on their favorites, even off the record, but none would budge an inch. The Cannes competition is serious business—even if the Kering dinner, with its spectacular views and heavy star power, can make it feel pretty fun too.

    "article_text": "Joachim Trierwas sitting in the writers’ room beside his longtime creative partner,Eskil Vogt.They’d just received a surprise Oscar nomination for their original screenplay,The Worst Person in the World—as well as a relatively expected nod for best international feature—marking the culmination of a remarkable run since that movie’spremiere at the Cannes Film Festivalnearly four years ago. “We had this feeling that if we thought too much about the pressure of following that one up, we’d be hindered from reaching in and getting more emotional,” Trier tells me. Around that time, the Norwegian filmmaker had also watchedPeter Jackson’s Beatles documentary,Get Back.“I don’t mean to compare us to the Beatles, but seeing my heroes from my childhood trying to be emotional and deal with something personal, amid this climate of pressure—I found that really consoling,” he says. So Trier told Vogt to hang a picture of George Harrison’s Rocky Stratocaster in the room. The colorful guitar would be their guiding light for what they wrote next. That film isSentimental Value,premiering at Cannes on Wednesday. It’s a film that feels as richly, achingly personal asWorst Person,but a little more grown up. This is by design: Since his last movie, Trier has grown up a bit too. He’s had two kids. He’s felt life moving fast. He’s been thinking about family reconciliation. “What is the language that we feel in a family structure of siblings, parents, and children, but we don’t speak?” Trier says. “So that’s the starting point for this one—the Beatles and family life.” Sentimental Valueopens with a narrator recalling an essay that Nora Berg (Renate Reinsve), a stage and TV actor in her mid-30s, wrote when she was 12. She imagined herself as the family home, a modest stunner in Oslo that’s passed through generations, and which acts as the film’s grand setting. She wonders how it would feel to see so much life come and go. Aside from a handful of flashbacks,Sentimental Valueotherwise plunges us into an emotionally volatile present, with the home being asked to hold a great deal. The mother of Nora and her sister, Agnes (Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas), has just died, which brings their estranged father, Gustav (Stellan Skarsgård), back into their orbit for the funeral. A noted film director who’s been out of the game for more than a decade, Gustav allowed his art to take precedence over his family. It seems things haven’t changed: plans to sell the house are stalled when Gustav decides he’d like to film his next project there. Next thing you know, he’s trying to hand Nora the script for said project, which contains vaguely autobiographical details about his childhood. He offers Nora the part that seems to resemble his own mother. She declines outright. Soon enough, Gustav is in pre-production on the movie. And now Netflix has come aboard because instead of Nora, it’s set to star Hollywood A-lister Rachel Kemp (Elle Fanning). Suddenly, they are rehearsing the script in English. (But the bulk ofSentimental Value,which Neon will release later this year, is in Norwegian, like most of Trier’s previous films.) “We have this impossible relationship between a daughter and a father, almost like a sad love story,” Trier says. “But they’re so similar. Within the home of the creative life, they can actually meet.” The overlap between the film-within-a-film and Nora’s own struggles in work and life becomes clearer, and more surprising, as Gustav’s deeper intentions come into focus—as doSentimental Value’s primary areas of inquiry. “Things are very polarized and very aggressive right now, and I completely respect people who want to use art now as a way of yelling out their anger and their opinions. I get it,” Trier says. “But at the same time, you could also look inward at what we are trying to protect in a world that’s getting quite brutal. There’s something about tenderness that’s just very humane, that we need to express.” He adds that he’s working within a long American cinematic lineage that feels increasingly out of style: “Everyone used to watchKramer vs. Kramerweeping, like, ‘Oh, it’s about our time.’ I’m free to get final cut, to make a film on a certain budget, to shoot on 35mm and all that stuff—so it feels natural to take that space and try to do something with it.” The house, a brilliant cinematic structure in its nooks and crannies and preserved beauty, was one of around 400 that Trier and his team had scouted. It belongs to the Norwegian rock musicianLars Lillo-Stenberg.“The moment I entered, I knew—and he let me use it,” Trier says. “He understands movies. He’s a musician, you know.” Renate Reinsve and Joachim Trier at Cannes in 2021. Renate Reinsve made her big-screen debut in Trier’s second movie, the swoonyOslo, August 31st,before showcasing her chops inThe Worst Person in the World.Her delicate, bracingly naturalistic turn as a wandering creative in her late 20s won her Cannes’s best-actress prize and the attention of Hollywood: She went on to star oppositeSebastian StaninA Different ManandJake GyllenhaalinPresumed Innocent. Now she’s back home, playing perhaps the most complex character of her career—one that requires her to run the emotional gamut. The first person to whom Trier pitched the movie, she allowed him to build the character around her. If that sounds a bit like what Gustav attempts with Nora, well,Sentimental Valueis very much about the intersection of filmmaking and reality. Trier is working on a more ambitious, expansive canvas here, though—so for one thing, Reinsve fits into a broader exploration of familial dynamics. Take her work with Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas, a standout as her sister. “We’re putting these sisters up against each other in a strange way and trying to measure how two siblings become so different from each other,” Trier says. Then there’s the matter of Gustav.Sentimental Valueis a true two-hander, giving Trier veteran Reinsve equal narrative agency as Skarsgård, a Swedish icon in his first Trier project. “Stellan is really one of the great Nordic actors of all time, and because [Gustav] is a bit of a difficult father, I needed an actor who has complexity, intelligence, that snappiness that can be cutting and hurtful, but also the warmth to create a more three-dimensional character,” Trier says. “I was supposed to play it cool and say, ‘Yeah, no, would you be interested?’ But I was so happy about talking to him that I used a silly American term, even in Norwegian. I said, ‘If you don’t want to do this, I’m up shit’s creek, man.’” Fortunately, Skarsgård promptly signed on. When it came to casting the final pivotal role of Rachel, lines got appropriately blurred. Fanning flew down to Oslo and met Trier in the house where the film would be shot, and where they went over the script while chatting about matters of work and life. “I said, ‘I’ll try to be a slightly easier director to work with than Gustav Berg,’” Trier says with a laugh. The dynamic between Gustav and Rachel speaks to perhaps the most meta element ofSentimental Value,which explores an evolving cinematic culture. This is a movie made in the spirit of American classics of decades past, and Gustav and Rachel, in their own ways, are yearning for a similar quality in the work they do together. “Every generation has a change of time when you see, ‘Oh, my time is over, or things are changing and new things are arriving,’” Trier says. “I was imagining what the film world would be for Gustav when dumped back into it—what would it look like now? There’s a sweet comedy to that, and a bond with Rachel, who just wants to make good movies.” Trier makes even this subtle but sharp industry commentary feel personal. The movie builds to a stunner of a final act—no spoiler for fans of Trier; he knows his way around an ending—that fusesSentimental Value’s ideas about family and film, life and art. “I am not ashamed of getting close, getting right in the eyeline, being brutally intimate sometimes,” Trier says. “But I wouldn’t just want to do a chamber drama with people sitting around the table talking. I need life and the beach in France and things that are more beautiful and playful. If not, I would get bored.” “With this film, me and my team, we allowed ourselves to be more us than ever,” Trier continues. “I know how to cut to the chase more, to get to what I want to do. We felt a bit more mature. We’re getting further away from ironic ’90s coolness, or whatever, and trying to be genuine about something.” This story is part ofAwards Insider’s in-depth2025 Cannes Film Festival coverage, including first looks and exclusive interviews with some of the event’s biggest names.

    "title": "‘The Last of Us’ Reunites Joel and Ellie—and Reveals What Really Happened to Eugene",
    "article_text": "It feels strange forThe Last of Usto spend an episode on Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie's (Bella Ramsey) happier days together so soon afterlosing Joel. He's only been missing for three episodes, and most of them have spent so much time introducing new characters and factions that Ellie has started to feel like a guest star on her own show. Yet with one episode to go, this brief season is already about to wrap up. So if there's going to be any reflection, it might as well be now, in an episode called \"The Price\" that’s structured as a series of flashback vignettes. In the first, a young Joel Miller has a conversation with his dad (Tony Dalton), who recalls his relationship with Joel's grandpa. The elder Miller remembers his father punching him in the face so hard his jaw needs to be wired shut. He's telling Joel this story because, while he has hit both Joel and Tommy, he told himself he would never hit them like his father hit him. That's the lesson he wants to impart to Joel: To be a little better than his own father. It's a nice scene well-acted by Dalton, but a very blunt tone-setter for the episode, which reflects on Joel's relationship with Ellie. Focusing on four of Ellie's birthdays in between seasons 1 and 2, it's this season's version of\"Long, Long Time,\" season 1'ssurprising and heartfeltstandalone following two characters' relationship over several years. Only this time, the characters are our former leading pair, a duo that’s sorely missed after Joel was killed at the end of \"Through the Valley.\" For most of the remaining hour, we get moments from Ellie's birthdays. For her 15th, Ellie's first year living in Jackson with Joel, Joel lovingly restores a guitar for her, and offers to teach her how to play. She asks him to sing, and he roughly, and sweetly sings the first verse of \"Future Days,\" the Pearl Jam song Ellie quietly sang the opening bars of in\"Feel Her Love\" last week. (This is how the whole episode functions: providing the full context for little bits of foreshadowing in the previous five episodes. It's like the show making its own Easter Eggs, as opposed to just pulling them from the game.) Ellie's 16th birthday adapts a moment fans ofThe Last of Us Part IIadore, a visit to a natural history museum where Joel has prepared a surprise for Ellie: a recording of the Apollo 15 mission for her to listen to while sitting in the actual space capsule, a real astronaut helmet on her head. Much like in the game, Ellie closes her eyes and the viewer sees what she imagines: The flare of rockets, the majestic depths of space. Unlike the game, we also see Joel's face the whole time: Completely taken by Ellie, and thrilled to make her so happy. By focusing on moments like this,The Last of Uswants us to know that even after the queasy, ambiguous ending of season one, Joel and Ellie have formed the kind of daddy-daughter relationship it isn't terribly clear they had at the start of season two. And as nice as these scenes are – Ramsey in particular has a lot of fun reverting to a younger, goofier version of Ellie – the more wholesome and complete relationship that the two are shown to have makes Ellie's present-day actions much harder to come to terms with. Prior to this episode, it seemed like the two of them had a lot of unresolved tension; that lack of resolution gives Ellie's actions grounding. But in \"The Price,\" as we see, the two do get the chance to clear the air on even the show's thorniest questions. After a rocky 17th birthday, where Joel tries to surprise Ellie with a cake only to find her doing \"all the teenage shit at once\"—fooling around with a slightly older girl, who gave her a tattoo, and brought weed—\"The Price\" skips ahead to Ellie's 19th birthday. She's rehearsing questions she has for Joel, things about their departure from the Firefly base at the end of season one that don't add up to her. She wants to ask them on her first patrol with Joel, but doesn't get the chance before an emergency demands their attention. This is the Eugene (Joe Pantalianio) storyThe Last of Ushas been teasing all season long, and it's honestly not terribly substantial for something so heavily hinted at. We basically know what happens from stray bits of dialog in preceding episodes: Eugene got bit while out in the woods, and Joel kills him before he turns. What's new—besides a heartbreaking performance from Pantaliano—is the immediate aftermath, where Joel lies to Gail (Catherine O'Hara) about Eugene's last moments. Joel claims that Eugene didn't want to see her because he wanted to keep her safe, and that he ended his own life. Ellie knows both of these claims are false. Seeing Joel lie sets her off; she blurts out the truth to Gail, who slaps Joel, and collapses in grief. The final vignette in \"The Price\" revisits the New Year's dance from the season premiere, where we see what Joel was up to that night. Mostly, he's getting forgiven: first by Maria (Rutina Wesley), who tells him she's sorry for getting mad and reminding him that he was a refugee once when they were arguing about how many newcomers Jackson could support—a pretty massive concession, and a strange one for the episodes three writers (Neil DruckmannandHaley GrossjoiningCraig Mazinfor the season's final two episodes) to just idly drop here. \"You're family,\" Maria tells Joel, the implication being that protecting family, and one's own, take precedence over refugees and strangers. Joel and Maria's heart-to-heart is cut short by Seth's harassment of Ellie and Dina (Isabela Merced), where Joel intervenes. But later, we see that Ellie approaches Joel on his front porch, and in her anger finally gets the nerve to confront him about the night he saved her. It all comes out: That he lied, that she was the only chance at a cure, and that he killed Marlene (Merle Dandridge). Like every scene in \"The Price,\" it's extremely well-acted, but the short-term catharsis seems to run counter to the story's long-term goals. While Ellie does get to say that Joel's choice robbed her of her agency, that he took her choice and the world's chance at a cure from everyone, Joel, through tears, says he'll pay the price of Ellie turning away from him. But he does not regret his choice, and that he'd do it all over again. \"Because I love you, in a way you can't understand.\" It's possibly Pascal's last scene as Joel, and he really goes for broke with it. But it's also coming after 50 minutes of Joel doing nice things for Ellie, always looking out for her even at his most overbearing—which, again, includes murdering a hospital full of people and dooming mankind. Ellie's perspective, that sacrificing herself would have given her life meaning, is rendered moot by Joel's paternalism. His perspective matters more, and the episode is built to underline that. In these last moments with Joel Miller,The Last of Us's writers repeat an error from the source material: they unmake the phenomenal ending from the first PlayStation game, and the HBO show's first season. As Ellie heads back to her Seattle hideout after murdering Nora (Tati Gabrielle), she returns a murkier character than when she left—one that will become harder to understand the more people she decides she must kill.

    "title": "‘The Last of Us’ Director Neil Druckmann on the Twists, Deaths, and Controversies of “The Price”",
    "article_text": "Neil Druckmann,the creative force behind the Last of Us video games, gets why viewers of the TV show would expect any episode he directs to be packed with action. He sort of expected that too. But the episode of the series he just helmed is relatively light on brutality—unless you count heavy-duty emotional violence. “It felt like a very important and intimate episode,” Druckmann tellsVanity Fairin an interview about episode six, “The Price.” ”Unlike last season, when I directed a very action-heavy episode, I really liked the idea that it hasnoaction. It’s all drama.” There isn’t much in the way of characters running from or destroying hordes of infected here, as there has been in other chapters fromThe Last of Us.There aren’t battles between warring factions of survivors fighting for dominance in the wasteland of what used to be America, either. But there is still significant tension, conflict, and revelation in Druckmann’s script, which he cowrote with fellow showrunnerCraig MazinandHalley Gross,aWestworldveteran who worked with him to craft the 2020 gameThe Last of Us Part II. “The Price” also brings backPedro Pascal’s Joel—who died in episode two of this season—by way of flashbacks focused on him andBella Ramsey’s Ellie. The story culminates with Joel confessing to Ellie that he killed the hospital staff who were trying to extract a cure from her. She reacts with grief—not only because he lied to her for so long about that rescue, but also because she would rather have given her life for something so meaningful. “We’re getting deep into Ellie and Joel’s relationship,” Druckmann says. “The stuff they’re talking about on that porch should resonate, going backwards and forwards with everything that the story has left to tell.” Vanity Fair:Ellie and Joel lay all their secrets out in episode six. What made this one you wanted to direct yourself? Neil Druckmann:Sometimes those dramatic sequences are more engaging than any action. I want people to lean forward and really be invested: How is this argument going to turn out? Ultimately, this show is about these relationships. We have really cool infected, and we have cool set pieces, but those sequences can only work if you care about the outcome for the people involved. Otherwise, you’re not going to be emotionally moved by it. The opening sequence shows Joel as a teenager with his brother, and we meet his cop father. His dad is played byBetter Call Saul’s Tony Dalton, who can be so intimidating. He is the scariest charming person onscreen. He does so much with so little, with just the intensity in his eyes. And then how that intensity turns to pain as he’s recalling what he had to experience with his father, and how he’s trying to do a little bit better. It was important that you believe him. I kept expecting their conversation to explode into violence. In the writing process, we had versions of the scene that you are describing. It ultimately felt more interesting for this dad to find some camaraderie with his son. It’s like, “This time the wrong thing that you did was actually thecorrectthing. Because you did violence to protect your tribe, your family, your brother. And that’s what I have done. Sometimes I’ve even hit you to protect you. So maybe now you can understand who I am.” And then he admits he doesn’t know if even that’s the correct thing. All he knows is that he didn’t beat them as badly as his dad did, so he knows he’s done alittlebit better. And he’s hoping that when his son grows up, Joel would do a little bit better than him. Joel says something similar to Ellie in the final scene on the porch. We know from the previous episode that Dina (Isabela Merced) is pregnant, and Ellie is going to help her care for the child. Joel didn’t know that would happen, but his words feel very prophetic now. Again, he’s not sure he has done the right thing or he has done better. He’s just hoping. “I made these choices. If I could go back in time, if I’m placed in that same scenario, I would make those choices again. And I don’t know if they’re right. And maybe I didn’t handle it the best way, but maybe you will do an even better job than me.” That’s a feeling I have now as a parent. My parents made certain mistakes when they raised me. That was some of the inspiration for the writing of this game and the show. In trying to course-correct their mistakes, I have made different mistakes. I just hope my kids will do even better than me. This is a prevailing theme throughout the second game and in this second season of the show, isn’t it? The notion that sometimes you must use violence to defend yourself or to protect yourself, but sometimes you have to be willing to let go, or else it’s eye for an eye forever. You’re touching on the complexity of how we’re all the same species, and then we subdivide ourselves into these groups. Then within these groups, we subdivide ourselves even further. This season the atrocities become more intense and more violent. And we keep forgetting that we’re all part of this very large tribe called humanity. But also, Ellie has been advocating that they have to fight back or risk being overwhelmed. Sometimes, in the course of history, there are moments we could look back on and say, “In those instances, violence was the correct path.” It’s not like protecting your city is always wrong, but sometimes it is. And sometimes it’s even hard to discern whether it was right or wrong. We wanted to explore the complexity of all of that. It seems like you’re interested in that notion that over time we should begin to forgive. Vendetta after vendetta is the other alternative. Those are the two choices that you have. Or I guess there’s three, right? You keep fighting forever until you completely defeat one side. Then it could end if you completely eliminate the other side and commit genocide. You could choose to find peace. Or you could just say, “Okay, we’ll just live with these skirmishes forever.” You were born in Israel, and I know this is probably a very sensitive subject because of the war that’s raging over there right now—but does this have more resonance for you now, given October 7 and the ongoing clash between Israel and the Palestinians? There is so much division in the United States, and you have Russia versus Ukraine—people who are neighbors are warring with each other all around the world, to one degree or another. Do these themes inThe Last of Usfeel different now, compared to when you first conceived them for part two of the game in 2020? I think you’re right in that we look for reasons to be really upset at other tribes. But at the same time, as humans, we’ve always dealt with this. And I suspect we always will. This idea of tribalism and conflict, I don’t see that disappearing. I would love for us to find some utopia where we could all live together, but it seems to just be a thing that just keeps repeating itself. I hope that each generation, we can imbue them with an openness to let people in. But the other thing we explore is sometimes that openness leaves you in a weak state. And that’s where it’s like there’s no clean answers. I feel like our job as artists is just to explore the complexity of it. That brings us back to the personal—a parent figure and a child. Each hoping the other has a safer, more peaceful life. Exactly. Going back to the game, I was intrigued with this idea of unconditional love a parent feels for their child. I remember, the moment I held my daughter in my hands, I just knew: “I would do whatever it takes to protect you. Whatever it takes.” And I wanted to just explore that here. Is there a dark side to that? That is a wonderful thing. And I could see the biological advantage that it gets you. But itcouldbe a horrific thing when you say: “at any cost.” And often we do. Sometimes it’s not even about our kid—it’s about our country, or it’s about our political party, or it’s about whatever you want to come up with, whatever tribes you belong to. This episode suggests that restraint can actually be a protective measure. Not fighting back, not extracting revenge, could be a smarter and more beneficial tactic than venturing out to take that revenge. You’re right. And you could say that Ellie misinterprets what Joel says. She thinks she’s as badass as he is, and she could torture someone and just move on. And she can’t. But she also misunderstands that he would’ve not wanted her to go. He would’ve wanted her to stay safe. And yet she laments that she could have died for the cure, especially after so many other survivors she cared about gave their own lives for hers. In her mind, that would’ve all been okay if at the end something better than their deaths came out of it. If we could have saved more people than people have died, that would’ve been okay. And he took that choice away from her. She felt, in doing so, he’s kind of damned her to this plain life in Jackson. She felt like those deaths will always be on her shoulders. They never really reconcile from the conversation we see in episode six. He was killed before they could make it better. She says, “I don't know if I couldeverforgive you for that.” But she loves him so much. The next thing she says is, “But I would like to try.” And we get this notion of like, Oh man, if they just had a few more moments together, they could have gotten past this. But then it’s taken from them by this other tribe, by this other person [Kaitlyn Dever’s vengeance-seeking Abby, who murdered Joel for killing her doctor father in the hospital massacre]. Ellie comes from this culture of honor. She must make them pay. I think that applies to two other warring groups we’ve seen this season: the religious order formally known asSeraphites (a.k.a. the Scars)andthe Washington Liberation Front(WLF, nicknamed the Wolves). It applies to a lot of people. It applies when someone cuts us off on the road and we act irrationally at that moment. All of a sudden, you’re like, Wait, I wasn’t myself. You lost yourself. You’re in some kind of spell or something. And what I realized when I was working on this story is that we all have this within us, and it wouldn’t take much to tip us into that state of mind. Has that ever happened for you? For me it happened when I watched certain events on TV and I justfelt such rage. I’m like, I don’t even know the people that are having these atrocities committed on them, and I’m feeling such anger and such vitriol. Then I was thinking, But what if it was someone that was the closest to me? What if that happens to the person I love the most? What kind of rage would I feelthen? And that’s where the whole story fell into place for me. That’s where we had to make certain decisions that I know some people are upset about, but that is by design. That is the purpose of it. What part are people upset about? Killing off Pedro Pascal, the most beloved person in Hollywood. [Laughs] I’m sure not everybody’s happy about that. You could go on TikTok and you can see a bunch of people are unhappy about it, but you can’t tell the story without it. Episode six also shows us what happened to Eugene, a fellow survivor whom we’ve heard Joel killed, although we’ve never met him. Joe Pantoliano brings him to life. Tell me about creating that scene. I think there’s a certain mystery. You’re just intrigued about who this guy is and what’s happening. You know Joel has killed him. So there’s a dramatic irony of watching that scene, in that you have more information than the characters. Then when you see him get bitten, you’re like, Oh, this is the moment. It’s less about, Is Eugene going to survive? And it's more like, How will this play out? Eugene begs Joel to take him back to the survivor compound because he has an important message for his wife, Gail (played by Catherine O’Hara), before the infection turns him into a monster. Later, he confesses he has nothing to tell her—he just wants to see her one more time. What was behind that lie? I think he was honest: He’s scared. It’s not about any words that he would have to give to her. He neededherto comfort him in this moment where he’s about to die, and he doesn’t know how to deal with it. Joey made this beautiful acting choice where he decided to regress to being a child. And if you watch his performance again, you’ll see he’s acting like a child that is just terrified. Did that scene evolve much in the writing? We spent a really long time in that Eugene sequence and had so many different versions of it. There were versions with a lot of action. And ultimately, when we landed on this idea that Joel’s going to lie about killing him, and that will be the proof that Ellie needed, everything just fell into place, and we got this beautiful, dramatic reveal that was different from the game. What were other variations on this sequence you considered? Actually, when we first wrote that scene, because it’sJoey Pants, we had more humor in it. And [while shooting] I’m like, “These lines just don’t work.” The scene became bigger than that. And his acting choices affected the writing of that scene. It becomes much more tragic as it is now. Joel says he will lead Eugene home before he changes, but then…he doesn’t. Joel does his best to give Eugene as beautiful of a death as he can. Under the constraints of, “I will never take you back to Jackson because that’s too dangerous.” But in this moment, Joel also becomes vulnerable and says, “If you love someone, you could always see their face.” My interpretation of that is Joel is thinking about his lost daughter. And he shares that with Eugene. Eugene knows he is about to be killed, and he tries to follow Joel’s suggestion. Whether Eugene is telling the truth in that moment or not when he says, “I see her…” [Shrugs] You could say he sees her—orhe’s given Joel an out, to say, “It’s okay for you to shoot me now.” I don’t know which one it is, actually. I don’t know either. I never asked Joey because I didn’t want to know. This theme we’re discussing about being unable to forgive, but needing to try—isn’t it being practiced by O’Hara’s character? She can’t forgive Joel for killing her Eugene, even though he was going to die anyway. But she’s trying. That’s right. That is the big question of, are there certain acts that are unforgivable? It’s not a coincidence thatUnforgivenwas a big inspiration when I was working on this game. With enough willpower, with enough mindfulness, is everything forgivable? If you were to ask a bunch of people, you’d get every answer under the sun. I don’t know if you’ve played the game, but to this day, five years later, people still are arguing about that ending and whether it was correct or not. You’re talking about the first game or the second game? Well, kind of both. But in this particular instance, I’m talking about the second game, because it deals with this exact question. And that’s ultimately where the show goes. Does it bother you to have people stirred up in that debate? I love that. As an artist, you can’t ask for anything more than people really engaging with your art and wrestling with it.

    "title": "How common is prostate cancer in Hong Kong and what can you do to treat it?",
    "article_text": "In the wake of ex-US president Joe Biden’s prostate cancer diagnosis, the Post takes a closer look at how the disease affects Hongkongers Former US president Joe Biden’s personal office announced on Sunday that the 82-year-old had recently been diagnosed with an “aggressive form” of prostate cancer, while in Hong Kong, corporate governance activist David Webb, 59, said this month he was preparing to transfer his online database, Webb-site, to other interested parties, as he did not have long to live after his 2020 diagnosis. From politicians such as Biden and the late South African president Nelson Mandela to business magnate Warren Buffett and celebrities like Ian McKellen and local veteran opera singer Law Kar-ying, the disease has afflicted many. The Post looks at the how common prostate cancer is in Hong Kong and the methods for treating it. The prostate is a gland roughly the size of a walnut situated in the male reproductive system between the base of the bladder and the urethra. Prostate cancer can occur when abnormal genetic changes lead to the development of malignant tumours within the gland, with the potential to spread to other areas of the body, especially the bones and lymph nodes in the pelvic region. According to the Hospital Authority, prostate cancer was the fourth most common in the city after lung, breast and colorectal cancer as of 2022, with 2,758 new cases recorded that year. It was also the third most common cancer in men. Prostate cancer saw the highest rate of increase – 69 per cent – over a 10-year period from 2012. It accounted for 16 per cent of new cancer cases in Hong Kong men in 2022, with the median age of diagnosis at 71.",

    "title": "Hong Kong to map safety risks of city’s numerous natural slopes using drones",
    "article_text": "Geotechnical Engineering Office’s Lawrence Shum also says his team will test landslide prediction model this rainy season Hong Kong authorities will use drones under a pilot project to create a catalogue of hundreds of thousands of natural slopes in the city for safety, following the identification of three large-scale, high-risk sites. Lawrence Shum Ka-wah, deputy head of the Geotechnical Engineering Office (GEO) on Hong Kong Island, said on Monday that his team would also test a landslide prediction model this rainy season after the city recorded the largest rockfall incident in nearly a century at Shau Kei Wan in 2023. The three high-risk sites are areas near Jardine’s Lookout in Wan Chai, Violet Hill in Tai Tam Country Park and Tai Wo Ping near Beacon Hill at the foot of Lion’s Rock. “It does not mean that landslides will occur at these three areas, but they have been identified for hazard assessment and necessary mitigation works,” he said. Shum said 181 landslides occurred in Hong Kong last year, down from the annual average of about 300, as the city had experienced 5 per cent less rainfall and fewer rainstorms. He noted that 20 per cent of the landslides in the past 60 years had occurred on natural hillsides with no prior history of such incidents, thus posing considerable risks and affecting critical infrastructure.",

    "title": "Are weight loss diets like fasting, low carbs harmful? Hong Kong experts weigh in",
    "article_text": "The Post unpacks survey findings on where Hongkongers get their diet tips and what experts say can be risky The Hong Kong Nutrition Association recently warned against the growing popularity of restrictive diets such as intermittent fasting and low-carbohydrate meals for weight loss. It followed a survey that found 40 per cent of respondents had experimented with such methods, often based on unverified information from social media and personal networks. Here, the Post unpacks the findings and what nutritionists say are more sustainable and evidence-based strategies for weight management. Intermittent fasting is an eating pattern that cycles between periods of eating and voluntary fasting on a regular schedule. Popular types include the time-restricted eating approach, such as the 16:8 method, where dieters eat within an eight-hour window of the day, while the remaining 16 hours are for fasting. This often means dieters skip a meal or two. Some dieters may also choose to alternate between days of normal eating and days of very low calorie intake of about 500 to 600 calories, or complete fasting. Others may fast for full days once or twice a week.",

    "title": "Mainland Chinese drug effective in treating 3 cancer types: Hong Kong-led study",
    "article_text": "CUHK researchers say drug D3S-001 can treat non-small cell lung, colorectal and pancreatic cancers triggered by gene mutation KRAS-G12C University researchers said on Monday that the novel drug, D3S-001, had shown promising results in treating non-small cell lung, colorectal and pancreatic cancers triggered by the gene mutation KRAS-G12C during its phase one clinical trial. The drug is said to be a “next-generation” inhibitor for the gene mutation, which can currently only be targeted using a limited number of therapeutic options. “It does inhibit KRAS-G12C at a quicker rate [than a first-generation inhibitor] and most likely at a longer duration as well,” said Dr Herbert Loong Ho-fung, an associate professor at CUHK’s clinical oncology department. “This is demonstrated in the laboratory and certainly in our clinical trials. We’re also seeing signals of this in our patients.” Researchers said KRAS gene mutations were common contributing factors in solid tumours including non-small cell lung, colorectal and pancreatic cancers, with KRAS-G12C being the most prevalent subtype.",
