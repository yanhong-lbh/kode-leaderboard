    "article_text": "Former Democratic lawmaker Susan Wild said Gov. Whitmer hiding her face in the Oval Office was \"cringey\" during an appearance on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" Former Democratic Rep. Susan Wild called Democratic Michigan Gov.Gretchen Whitmer's decision to hide her face in a photo at the White House \"cringey\" during an appearance Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"I apologize ahead of time to the Democrats at the table because I don’t mean it aimed at you, but one thing that seemed to symbolize kind of the weird place that Democrats are in, and it is this photograph of governor Gretchen Whitmer standing in theWhite House,\" CNN host Jake Tapper began, speaking to his panel. \"It’s a picture of Gretchen Whitmer hiding her face.\" Whitmer was seentemporarily shielding her face from cameras in the Oval Office by holding up a folder, according to a photo bythe New York Times. She later lowered the folder as the president spoke to the press and encouraged Whitmer to comment as well. Tapper asked Wild what was going on with her party during the discussion about the photo. \"That begs the question of what she was doing there anyway,\" Wild said, explaining that Whitmer was there totalk to the presidentabout issues pertinent to her state. \"So, you know what I would have done if that was me, I would have said, ‘I‘m not going in there,’ or when the press came in or the cameras came in, I would have been out of there. It's cringey.\" TRUMP PRAISES DEM GOV. GRETCHEN WHITMER AFTER SLAMMING HER LAST YEAR: 'VERY GOOD PERSON' Former Democratic Rep. Susan Wild said Gov. Whitmer hiding behind a photo during a photo op at the Oval Office was \"cringey.\"(Screenshot/CNN) \"The American automakers are happy about these tariffs. So, I understand why she went. But that was the ultimate cringey move right there. That was right out of 'Veep,'\" Wild added. PresidentDonald Trumppraised Whitmer after their meeting at the White House and said she had done a good job. According to a statement from a spokesperson for Whitmer, the governor and president discussed \"the northern Michigan ice storm, investing in Michigan’s defense assets, like Selfridge Air National Guard Base, tariffs and the importance of creating good-paying American jobs and bringing back critical supply chains and keeping our Great Lakes clean and safe.\" \"We're honored to have Gretchen Whitmer from Michigan, great state of Michigan. And, she's been — she's really done an excellent job. And a very good person,\" Trump said during the press conference on Wednesday. Whitmer is widely seen as a future presidential candidate given she's the two-term governor of a swing state. Whitmer told reporters afterward that she thought she was coming into the Oval Office for a one-on-one meeting with the president and was surprised by the press conference.

    "title": "Rory McIlroy beats Justin Rose in Masters playoff to win green jacket, complete Grand Slam",
    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Rory McIlroy didn’t make it easy for himself, but after a rollercoaster final round on Sunday, he is the winner of the green jacket at the 89th edition ofThe Mastersafter beating Justin Rose in a sudden-death playoff. McIlroy, who has waited 11 years to win another major, was overcome with emotion as he has done what only five golfers in history had before him. His win at Augusta National Golf Club means he has won every single major, which includes thePGA Championship(2012, 2014), the U.S. Open (2011) and The Open Championship (2014), giving him the career Grand Slam. Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods are the only players in history to win every major prior to McIlroy. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Rory McIlroy lines up his putt on the no. 1 green during the final round of the Masters Tournament at Augusta National Golf Club.(Katie Goodale-Imagn Images) McIlroy's final round was filled with tons of drama from start to finish, and it reached its highest point when he stepped into the putt on his 72nd hole of the tournament. He needed par to finish at 12-under to beat Rose, who drained a deep birdie putt on the same green a few minutes before to finished 11-under for the tournament. The putt was just left, and the patrons couldn't believe it as a playoff was needed to see who would get fitted for a green jacket in Butler Cabin. Rose was hitting at the tournament practice facility awaiting the potential of the first Masters sudden death playoff since 2017, which he was a part of. He ended up losing to Sergio Garcia to miss out on the green jacket. MASTERS OFFICIALS PENALIZE GOLFER OVER BALL MOVE He quickly jumped into a golf cart after learning McIlroy had missed the par putt and went to the 18th tee box to meet the Northern Irishman, who had to do it all over again. Rose and McIlroy both found the fairway with their tee shots, with the former going first with his approach. And he put tremendous pressure on McIlroy, as Rose bounced the ball near the hole and got a bit unlucky as it trickled away. McIlroy, who hit his approach into the right greenside bunker, got the baby draw he wanted this time, and he used the slope to spin the ball back to two feet. Rose still had a great look at birdie, and took his time reading the putt. He gave it a good ride, but it broke too far right, and he cleaned up for par. Thus, McIlroy had another chance to finally secure what he's been searching for since he began his illustrious golf career. McIlroy, who never takes a practice putt, walked up to his ball, looked at the hole and put the perfect stroke on it this time. The patrons went into a frenzy as McIlroy dropped to his knees and started crying, as the dream and goal finally turned into reality. He broke down even more meeting with his wife, Erica Stoll, and their daughter, Poppy, along with many others in his life as he walked to Butler Cabin for his green jacket. Rory McIlroy celebrates after winning a playoff on the 18th green during the final round of the Masters Tournament at Augusta National Golf Club.(Katie Goodale-Imagn Images) Rose finished second after carding a 66 final round, while Patrick Reed (9-under), Scottie Scheffler (8-under), and Bryson DeChambeau and Sungjae Im (7-under each) rounded out the top five on the Masters leaderboard. Drama was expected in this final round on Sunday, but perhaps no one expected this to be one of the most up-and-down finishes in the history of this great tournament. It happened right away on the first hole when McIlroy double-bogeyed the opening hole after a three-putt. His tee shot needed just one more yard to sail over the right fairway bunker, but it landed in the sand instead, forcing a layup. Then, his approach shot was too deep, causing a long par putt that wouldn’t go. But even more crushing for the man who led at 12-under to begin the round was missing his bogey putt, causing a two-stroke swing. DeChambeau would birdie after sending his tee shot a bit too far left. So, in a flash, DeChambeau and McIlory were tied at 10-under heading to the scoreable par-5 second hole. Once again, McIlroy’s tee shot couldn’t clear the right fairway bunker, while DeChambeau had an excellent look at an approach to the second green. McIlroy laid up and had a poor approach, which made it a hard birdie look. He would sink his par putt to leave his score at 10-under, but DeChambeau took the sole lead at 11-under after hitting his birdie putt. The score swing, though, wasn’t even close to over. The third hole presented a quick turnaround for McIlroy, who watched a birdie putt go left to right and hang on to get a shot back, while DeChambeau’s par save didn’t have the right line. He had to settle with a bogey and McIlroy once again owned the lead. Then, the fourth hole, a 232-yard par-3, saw McIlroy dialed in with his iron shot that landed within 10 feet of the hole for a solid birdie look. DeChambeau’s drew too much and he couldn’t get his long birdie putt close for another par save. He dropped another bogey, while McIlroy landed back-to-back birdies to get back to 12-under – owning a three-stroke lead after four holes. Bryson DeChambeau plays from the fairway on the eighth green during the final round of the Masters Tournament at Augusta National Golf Club.(Peter Casey-Imagn Images) Overall, there were three two-shot swings in the first four holes. McIlroy stayed on an even keel after getting back to 12-under, shooting par in his next four holes before taking a four-stroke lead over DeChambeau, Ludvig Åberg and Rose, who birdied four times during a six-hole stretch to get back into the running at 9-under, after birdying the ninth hole. The second nine started off clean for McIlroy, who poured in another birdie putt to go to 14-under. It didn’t look like he would’ve had a birdie chance after dropping his club immediately after contact on his second from the fairway, but it drew right back into the green the way he wanted. Meanwhile, DeChambeau’s second nine was a disaster as the infamous \"Amen Corner,\" or Holes 11, 12 and 13, ate him up. It started with a huge error hitting his approach on No. 11 into the water next to the green. He’d fall to 7-under with a double-bogey after trying to salvage the hole, and things got worse when he couldn’t hole his par putt on the short 12th, which always proves to be an issue for players. DeChambeau started the day at 10-under, but found himself 6-under, seven shots off McIlroy’s lead at the time, heading into the 13th hole. Justin Rose reacts after teeing off on no. 12 during the final round of the Masters Tournament at Augusta National Golf Club.(Katie Goodale-Imagn Images) The 13th hole saw McIlroy playing safe, as he should’ve with the lead he had at the time. But his third shot, a short pitch that should’ve been routine, proved disastrous when he hit it too far right and it entered the water. McIlroy wasn’t able to hit his bogey putt after re-doing the pitch, and he fell to 11-under. On the 16th green, Rose holed his tremendous tee shot to get to 11-under himself, and the movie that was playing out at Augusta National reached peak tension. McIlroy lost his lead after bogeying the 14th to fall to 10-under, as Rose had the outright lead when he stepped into his par putt on the 17th hole. But he tugged it left, leaving a three-way tie at 10-under between McIlroy, Rose, and Åberg. The climax of this movie, though, was provided by McIlroy’s seven iron from 207 yards out, needing a right-to-left bender to carry the pond in front of the 15th green. He executed the shot with precision, as the patrons around roared with the ball making its way closer to the green for an eagle putt. McIlroy wouldn’t make it after hitting it left, but he made birdie to take the lead once more. But like any movie, the climax only leads to the ending, and it was an amazing finish. On the 18th green, Rose had one last birdie in him, sinking a deep putt to sit tied for the co-lead with McIlroy at 11-under. He would head into the clubhouse and watch with bated breath to see how the golfers behind him would finish. He finished with a final-round 66. McIlroy had a great look on No. 16 after a great tee shot, but it never broke back, and he stayed tied with Rose at 11-under. Thus, two more holes left for McIlroy, who needed a birdie or better to win it. Rory McIlroy falls to his knees in celebration after winning a playoff on the no. 18 green during the final round of the Masters Tournament at Augusta National Golf Club.(Kyle Terada-Imagn Images) So, just like he did on No. 15, McIlroy started walking toward his approach on No. 17, asking his shot with an eight iron to, \"Go, go, go!\" That’s exactly what the ball did, as it set up yet another chance for McIlroy to get his lead back. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP McIlroy had to have tons of mental fortitude all day long after missing his par putt the first time he stepped foot on the 18th green, and he trusted himself to play the hole better during the playoff. All those missed shots, all those putts that came so close, everything that has happened the past decade that has led McIlroy to question if he'd ever win another major, or better yet, complete the Grand Slam wasn't in his head when he walked into that final putt in the playoff. It's always about the next shot, and this time, McIlroy didn't miss. History followed. Follow Fox News Digital’ssports coverage on X, and subscribe tothe Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

    "title": "Trump vows nobody getting 'off the hook' for 'unfair' trade balances, says there was no tariff 'exception'",
    "article_text": "O’Leary Ventures Chair Kevin O’Leary joins ‘Fox News Live’ to break down the intensifying U.S.-China trade war and why he says it’s time to go big on tariffs. PresidentDonald Trumpvowed on Sunday that nobody was getting \"off the hook\" for unfair trade balances and tariff barriers, which other countries have used against the U.S. The Trump administration announced Friday that it was exempting imported smartphones, laptops and other electronics from reciprocal tariffs, but the president wanted to clear a few things up. \"There was no Tariff ‘exception’ announced on Friday,\" Trump said in a post on X on Sunday. \"These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff 'bucket.’  The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it. We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations. \"What has been exposed is that we need to make products in the United States, and that we will not be held hostage by other Countries, especially hostile trading Nations like China, which will do everything within its power to disrespect the American People,\" he continued. \"We also cannot let them continue to abuse us on Trade, like they have for decades, THOSE DAYS ARE OVER!\" TRUMP'S TARIFF BLITZ NOW EXEMPTING ELECTRICAL GOODS LIKE PHONES, LAPTOPS President Trump said on Truth Social on Sunday that no country was \"off the hook\" for unfair trade balances and tariff barriers.(Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) Trump closed out his post by saying the Golden Age of America will mean \"more and better paying jobs\" as well as making products in the U.S. and treating other countries as they have treated America. \"The bottom line is that our Country will be bigger, better, and stronger than ever before,\" he said. \"We will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" Customs and Border Protection issued new guidance on reciprocal tariff negotiations late Friday, noting the exemption of those goods from Trump’s April 2 executive order that declared a national emergency due to non-reciprocaltrade practicesand structural imbalances in the global trading system. Subsequent executive orders ramped up tariffs on China to 125%.

They apply to goods that left a warehouse as of April 5. The new move will likely ease the blow for consumers while giving a boost to electronics giants such as Apple, Samsung and Dell. A White House official confirmed to Fox News that the exemptions were put in place. CHINA REFUSES TO BACK DOWN ON TARIFFS AFTER TRUMP THREATENED TOUGHER MEASURES Trump announced tariff exemptions for electronics as Nvidia works to bring its manufacturing to the U.S. as soon as possible.(Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Products included in the exemption are things like hard drives, computer processors, solar cells, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, flat-panel TV displays and memory chips. But in light of the easing of tariffs on electronics, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday the exemption would be temporary. \"They’re exempt from the reciprocal tariffs, but they’re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,\" Lutnick told ABC’s \"This Week\" on Sunday. Lutnick’s comments Sunday made clear that more changes were on the horizon. Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Saturday night that he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. \"We’ve been making a lot of money,\" he said. \"It’s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China, was making a lot of money.\" CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS In a statement issued Saturday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt did not specifically address the exemptions but indicated the administration still plans to push for tech companies to move manufacturing to the U.S. She said the administration has secured U.S. investments from tech companies, including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia, that are \"hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\" Fox News Digital’s Michael Dorgan, Brie Stimson and Sarah Tobianski, as well as the Associated Press, contributed to this report.

    "article_text": "New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker called for a congressional hearing and investigation into President Trump for insider trading after his tariff pause announcement. \"Meet the Press\" host Kristen Welker pressed Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., Sunday on whether there’s any real evidence to investigate PresidentDonald Trumpover what Democrats have alleged was \"insider trading\" with his tariff reversal. Trump announceda 90-day pausein the massive tariff hikes he levied against foreign nations on Wednesday, excluding China. Hours before his announcement, he took to Truth Social to tell his followers that \"everything is going to work out well\" and it was a \"great time to buy\" stock after the significant drops it suffered over the past week. Several Democratic senators have sinceaccused Trump of market manipulationand insider trading based on his sudden reversal after he previously insisted that he would not budge on the tariffs. DEMOCRATS ARE BLOWING THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO HAMMER TRUMP ON TARIFFS, WASHINGTON POST COLUMNIST WARNS President Trump announced a 90-day pause on implementing tariff hikes on most foreign nations.(Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images) Welker questioned Booker on Sunday about whether there was solid evidence for the charge beyond Trump’s Truth Social post. \"Do you believe that Democrats have any real evidence that anyone in the administration profited off of the president’s policies and announcements, or is this just a fishing expedition?\" Welker asked. \"You know, here’s the problem with Donald Trump and congressional Republicans. It is our whole system was designed to have checks and balances,\" Booker responded. \"Now, Trump has designed an administration like none we’ve ever seen before. He is attacking the very agencies that are supposed to have independent oversight of these kinds of actions.\" Booker went on to argue that Congress needs to uphold its role in holding the president accountable, only for Welker to interrupt and repeat her question.

    "title": "Astros fan rips foul ball out of Angels star Mike Trout's glove in bizarre scene",
    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Another fan-player controversy involving a foul ball found its way to the MLB stage on Saturday night, this time involvingLos Angeles Angelsstar Mike Trout and a Houston Astros patron. Yanier Diaz of Houston skied a ball down the right field line, andTrout began trackingit all the way toward the edge of the seats. That’s when he jumped to catch the ball only to have it ripped out by Astros fan Jared Whalen out of his glove. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Los Angeles Angels right fielder Mike Trout walks on the field before the game against the Houston Astros at Daikin Park.(Troy Taormina-Imagn Images) MLB fans on social media immediately compared the situation to the 2024 World Series when New York Yankees fans took the ball, and glove, offLos Angeles Dodgersstar Mookie Betts’ hand, causing their ejection. Those fans also got an indefinite ban from all 30 big league ballparks. However, there’s a key difference in this situation because Whalen was in his right to grab the ball due to it being in foul territory. He never reached over the border to make the catch a la Steve Bartman on that fateful day at Wrigley Field. YANKEES FANS TRY TO RIP GLOVE OFF MOOKIE BETTS' HAND, PRY BALL OUT Whalen spoke to The Athletic after the game, saying he was simply defending his son as the ball was headed in his direction. \"I just didn’t know what was going on,\" he said. \"I didn’t realize it was a play. It was coming at my son’s face. I just reached out.\" Los Angeles Angels right fielder Mike Trout (27) greets Houston Astros second baseman Jose Altuve before the game at Daikin Park.(Troy Taormina-Imagn Images) Trout appeared like he was going to make a tremendous foul-ground play, and he was heated when an umpire simply called it a foul ball. Security came down to address Whalen, but he wasn’t ejected from the game. Instead, he and his son were moved to different seats. Then, after the Angels’ 4-1 victory over the Astros, Trout met with Whalen and his son in the Daikin Park tunnel. Trout was heard telling Whalen that he appreciated his reaction, and Whalen said he meant no ill will toward the Angels outfielder. He even offered the ball back to Trout. Trout, giving Whalen’s son a signed bat, signed the foul ball his father caught.

    "title": "Daughter of German-American dissident whose body was mutilated by Iran calls on Trump to nix nuke talks",
    "article_text": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on countering China's influence at the Panama Canal and nuclear talks with Iran. The daughter of aGerman-American journalistwho died in the custody of Iran and whose body was returned mutilated and missing body parts urged the Trump administration on Sunday to pull the plug on nuclear talks with the Islamic Republic. Jamshid \"Jimmy\" Sharmahd, 69, a California resident who was kidnapped while on a business trip in the United Arab Emirates in 2020 and taken to Tehran, wasexecutedin October. His daughter, Gazelle Sharmahd, told Fox News Digital his body was returned bearing horrific signs of torture. IRAN REPORTEDLY EXECUTES CALIFORNIA MAN AMID ONGOING EXECUTION SPREE \"I traveled to Berlin with my family not to embrace my freed father after five years of torture by these terrorists, but to receive his mutilated body in a box,\" she said. \"The regime did not only torture my father physically and mentally for more than 1,500 days as the U.S. Biden administration and Germany was watching idly, even after killing my father they cut out his organs.\" Gazelle Sharmahd said an autopsy report showed her father's tongue, larynx, thyroid and heart were missing, and he only had two teeth. Sharmahd's daughter said her father had Parkinson's disease and was being held in isolation.(Sharmahd family) The daughter, who fruitlessly lobbied the Biden administration to free her father, said the U.S. and Germany should not negotiate with a nation capable of such atrocities. \"On the day that a German-American patriot and hostage was returned in pieces in a casket, with his tongue and heart cut out, barely recognizable to my family and me, Germany and the U.S. consider sitting down with the killers of their dual national hostage,\" she said. The Trump administration startedindirect talks with Iran’s clericalregime on Saturday in Oman, a Mideast country, where Jimmy was taken after he was kidnapped in the UAE and later moved to Iran. AHEAD OF TRUMP ADMIN-IRAN TALKS, NEW REPORT SAYS IRAN NUCLEAR THREAT RISES TO 'EXTREME DANGER' Sharmahd, who was a sharp critic of the regime in Tehran, was considered an American national under the Levinson Act, according to the family’s lawyer, Jason Poblete, who is an expert on victims kidnapped by totalitarian regimes. The Levinson Act defines a \"United States national\" as a \"lawful permanent resident with significant ties to the United States.\" According to the State Department, the definition applies to non-U.S. citizens. The act was named afterRobert Levinson, a retired FBI agent and private investigator who disappeared from an Iranian island in 2007. Levinson was held hostage and was declared dead in 2020 when he was said to have died in Iranian custody. His family blamed the Iranian regime for his capture and imprisonment. The FBI said it received this image of Robert Levinson in April 2011, four years after his disappearance.(FBI) Gazelle Sharmahd called on FBI Director Kash Patel and German authorities to investigate the murder of her father and issue arrest warrants for the Iranian regime officials responsible for his summary execution. TRUMP HAS TIMELINE IN MIND FOR IRAN NUKE DEAL, TAPS ISRAEL TO LEAD ANY POTENTIAL MILITARY ACTION She received support from the German-Iranian community. Behrouz Asadi, a prominent German-Iranian human rights activist, sent a letter to the German federal prosecutor, Jens Rommel, about Jimmy’s case. \"We urge you to initiate criminal investigations against those responsible in the Islamic Republic of Iran, especially those directly or indirectly responsible for his abduction, imprisonment, torture, and ultimately his killing,\" Asadi wrote. FBI SAYS CHINA, IRAN USING NEW TACTICS TO TARGET CRITICS IN US Poblete posted on X that Jimmy Sharmahd's murder was \"the result of a brutal regime acting with impunity—and of systemic failures by both the United States and Germany, who did not do enough. This is what happens when Americans and other U.S. nationals held hostage/unjustly detained are abandoned abroad. As Jimmy starts his journey home, our prayers are with the Sharmahd family. Justice for Jimmy will be pursued—relentlessly and without pause. We call on the media and all Americans to NeverForget Jimmy and to keep US nationals foremost on their minds when discussing hostage issues and engaging partners, allies, and adversaries.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Friedrich Merz(Michael Kappeler/dpa via AP) Sharmahd said she believes German Christian Democratic party politicianFriedrich Merz, who is expected to become chancellor in May, and President Donald Trump will stand up to terrorist regimes in ways their predecessors did not. \"President Trump is newly elected but has promised to stand with hostages and stand up to jihadists, be it Hamas, Hezbollah, Houthis or the biggest one, the Islamic regime in Iran,\" she said.

    "title": "Artificial intelligence transforms patient care and reduces burnout, physician says",
    "article_text": "With just one click, the AI technology begins transcribing the doctor’s conversation with a patient. DENVER –Artificial intelligenceis quietly transforming how doctors interact with patients — and it might already be in use during your next visit to the doctor’s office. Thousands of physicians across the country are using a form of AI called ambient listening, surveys show. This technology listens to conversations betweendoctors and patients, creates real-time transcriptions, and then compiles detailed clinical notes — all without disrupting the flow of the appointment. Dr. Daniel Kortsch, associate chief of artificial intelligence and digital health at Denver Health, said that ambient listening technology has made a big difference since his practice began using it in fall 2024. WHAT IS AI? \"It really shifts the doctor-patient interaction, so they can actually just talk and be humans,\" Kortsch told Fox News. Across the country, thousands of physicians are now using a new form of AI called ambient listening.(Kennedy Hayes/ Fox News) At Denver Health, the physicians used an AI tool called Nabla. With just one click, it begins transcribing thedoctor’s conversation with a patient— even supporting multiple languages, according to Kortsch. After the visit, it generates a summary that can be added to the patient’s medical record. Thishealthcare innovationcomes at a critical time. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, the U.S. is facing a projected shortage of 57,000 to 72,000 physicians this year, which increases workloads and contributes to provider burnout. HOW AI IS REVOLUTIONIZING THE WORLD OF MEDICINE \"We saw that our providers who used Nabla were working less at home. They had less ‘pajama time,’\" said Kortsch, referring to the time doctors spend at home in their pajamas, typing on their computers. For patients who may be skeptical of AI, tech companies are emphasizing that doctors remain fully in control, and that there is a system of checks and balances between physicians and the AI devices writing up patient summaries. After the visit, the AI tool, Nabla, generates a full summary that can be added to the patient’s medical record.(Nabla) \"Ultimately, the physician is still 100% in control of what happens and making sure … it is indeed the right thing that should be happening for the patient,\" Kenneth Harper, the Massachusetts-based head of Dragon Copilot at Microsoft, a provider of medical AI, told Fox News. AI MODEL COULD HELP PREDICT LUNG CANCER RISKS IN NON-SMOKERS, STUDY FINDS: ‘SIGNIFICANT ADVANCEMENT’ There are currently 600 healthcare organizations — in Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, Texas and Pennsylvania — using Dragon Copilot, Microsoft's ambient listening technology, according to a company spokesperson. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The tool \"promotes clinician well-being, increases efficiency, and improves bothprovider and patient outcomesthrough its fast, accurate, secure and intuitive speech and ambient capabilities,\" according to Microsoft. \"It really shifts the doctor-patient interaction, so that they can actually just talk and be humans,\" Kortsch told Fox News of the AI technology.(Kennedy Hayes/ Fox News) While AI is easing the workload for providers, Kortsch said patients are also benefiting from more direct engagement during visits. Looking ahead, Kortsch said Denver Health plans to continue expanding theuse of this technologybeyond doctors. Training is underway for nurses, psychiatrists, psychologists and physical therapists, bringing the benefits of ambient AI to even more parts of the healthcare system. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER \"People become doctors not because they want to write notes and fill out paperwork,\" he said. \"It’s because they want that interaction — and ambient AI gives it to them.\" For more Health articles, visitwww.foxnews.com/health The United States is projected to face a shortage of up to 86,000 physicians by 2036, according to an estimate from the Association of American Medical Colleges.

TRUMP FREEZES AID TO SOUTH AFRICA, PROMOTES RESETTLEMENT OF REFUGEES FACING RACE DISCRIMINATION This has led to often heated discussions about Afrikaners, and, up until now, no details from the U.S. side. But now there’s real movement, not just talk, taking place. \"The U.S. Embassy in Pretoria (South Africa) is reviewing inquiries from individuals who have expressed interest to the Embassy in refugee resettlement to the United States and has begun reaching out to some individuals to schedule and conduct informational interviews,\" the State Department told Fox News Digital. According to the nongovernmental South African Chamber of Commerce in the U.S., as of last month, 67,042 South Africans have expressed interest in the refugee offer, but the State Department told Fox News digital, \"We do not have anything to share on numbers of participants at this stage of the process.\" There’s also been a flurry of flights across the Atlantic to Washington by groups looking to get the White House’s, and ultimately the president’s, attention. First was the political group AfriForum, widely credited with alerting President Trump to the need for \"humanitarian relief\" for Afrikaners. Among other organizations making the trek to D.C. was the Cape Independence Advocacy Group, which says Cape Town and some of the surrounding areas should become a state separate from the rest ofSouth Africa. But perhaps the Orania Movement’s trip to Washington, and its request for U.S. help, is of most interest. \"Help us Here,\" is the slogan Orania CEO Joost Strydom declared to Washington insiders. SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT SIGNS CONTROVERSIAL LAND SEIZURE BILL, ERODING PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS Orania has a population of 3,000 people. Its leaders have been lobbying the U.S. in the hope it will get support for its campaign for autonomy.(Riaan Badenhorst/Orania Movement) Orania is a small but rapidly growing settlement of 3,000 Afrikaners in South Africa’s Karoo region. Strydom told Fox News Digital those settlers don’t want to become refugees in the U.S. but are seeking Washington's support to become truly autonomous in Africa \"not necessarily with U.S. tax dollars, but with recognition with our pursuit of a national home for Afrikaners. \"Orania's goal is to grow and protect the safety and freedom of Afrikaners. If we can make decisions for ourselves, we can look after our own safety and prosperity. If we are free, we are safe. \"We are a people of Africa, we belong here. We have no other home. On a personal note, my great-grandfather came to Africa in 1676, 100 years before the U.S. declaration of independence.\" Founded in 1988, Orania claims it’s entirely white, Afrikaner population is growing at an average of 10-12% a year, with a growth in business projects of 26%. It has its own water purification and solar power systems. In one of the driest parts of South Africa, Orania’s farmers are successfully developing corn, wheat, pecan nuts, almonds and livestock. Orania has built its own Afrikaans language schools and a college and has plans to open its own university. Orania has its own solar power systems.(Riaan Badenhorst/Orania Movement) The Orania delegation went to Washington, Strydom said, due to \"the fact that President Donald Trump gave us recognition as a people, the Afrikaners. (It) made it very important for us to hasten our already-planned U.S. liaison tour to liaise with Afrikaner and American supporters of the Orania idea in the U.S. TRUMP, SOUTH AFRICA IN GROWING ROW OVER HOTLY CONTESTED LAND LAW, COUNTRY'S DEALS WITH US FOES \"We had meetings with officials upon invitation and discussed substantive matters in depth, which, for the sake of an ongoing conversation and our honor towards newfound contacts, we will only specify publicly later.\" The South African government has attacked those who have gone knocking on Washington’s doors. \"These groups do not represent the majority of South Africans, whether it's the Orania movement or it's AfriForum or it's this Cape Independence Advocacy,\" the presidency spokesperson Vincent Magwenya told reporters March 20. TheState Departmentspokesperson made the administration’s viewpoint clear to Fox News Digital this week. \"Through his executive order, the president has taken steps to hold the government of South Africa accountable for the violation of Afrikaner rights and has instructed the administration to prioritize humanitarian relief for Afrikaners who are victims of unjust racial discrimination,\" the spokesperson said. Orania’s farmers grow corn, wheat, pecans and almonds and also raise livestock.(Riaan Badenhorst/ Orania Movement) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Hanli Pieters, who works at Bo-Karoo Opleiding, Orania's college, is proud of being an Afrikaner and told Fox News Digital she wants to stay in Orania. \"I choose to live in Orania because it offers what so few places can — a safe and purposeful future for Afrikaners. Here, I can live, pray without fear and speak Afrikaans not as a formality, but as the heartbeat of my daily life. We take hands as a community to build, to work and to grow. Orania is where Afrikaner identity becomes legacy.\" Fox News Digital reached out to the South African government for comment but had not received a response at the time of publication.

    "title": "Fears of another narco-state rise as Latin American country readies for pivotal vote",
    "article_text": "Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido and local Florida Latino leaders make an announcement in Miami. Ecuadorians go to the polls today in a runoff election between incumbent President Daniel Noboa and leftist challenger Luisa González. Noboa is seen as a pro-Trump conservative, while González is viewed as an ideological ally of Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro. Noboa refused to recognize Maduro as the legitimate president of Venezuela after his staged 2024 election and is also committed to fighting criminal gangs with all available resources to restore peace and security in Ecuador. It's expected González will follow in the footsteps of her mentor, former president Rafael Correa, and seek stronger ties with Latin America’s leftist governments of Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silval, Gustavo Petro of Colombia and Gabriel Boric of Chile. \"Security has been his principal mandate as the president of Ecuador. He’s dedicated a lot of time, effort and resources to deal with the security situation,\" Joseph Humire, executive director of the Center for a Secure Free Society and senior fellow of the America First Policy Institute, told Fox News Digital. EXCLUSIVE LOOK INTO TRUMP REPATRIATION FLIGHT ON C-17 MILITARY PLANE TO ECUADOR Ecuador President Daniel Noboa, who is running for re-election, waves after accompanying his running mate, Maria Jose Pinto, to cast her ballot during the presidential election in Quito, Ecuador, Feb. 9, 2025.(AP Photo/Carlos Noriega) \"However, there’s been only marginal improvements in the security situation, and it’s compounded with other problems,\" Humire added. González is running on a platform calling for an increase in the military’s role in fighting gang violence but also strongly condemns excessive use of force and abuse of human rights. She \"appears to have a softer perspective on the issue of crime, meaning she has not stated her willingness to chase drug cartels but, most probably, would intend to negotiate with them,\" Mathias Valdez Duffau, visiting fellow at the Center for International Studies at Catholic University of Argentina, told Fox News Digital. Valdez Duffao said a policy of negotiation is similar to the policy of formerPresident Correa’sadministration and would focus on whole-of-government crime reduction approaches that would look to integrate criminal gangs into civil society. \"The reality is that negotiating with criminal gangs might give the government a short-term space to maneuver, but the gangs become stronger and end up co-opting government officials, which eventually leads the country to the brink of becoming a narco-state,\" ValdezDuffao warned. Luisa González, presidential candidate for the Citizen Revolution Movement, speaks after polls closed for the presidential election in Quito, Ecuador, Feb. 9, 2025.(AP Photo/Carlos Noriega) Violence and insecurity remain at the top of voters’ minds. Ecuador has the highest murder rate in Latin America, with 6,986 recorded homicides in 2024, making it the second most violent year in Ecuador’s history. Some 95,000 people fled the country in 2024 as many communities became focal points of turf wars between rival gangs competing for territory. President Noboa declared an internal armed conflict in 2024 and ordered the armed forces to carry out military operations to neutralize various transnational organized crime groups. The anti-crime initiative saw an increase in the military’s presence in prisons and communities across the country. RUBIO SCORES KEY WINS FOR TRUMP IMMIGRATION AGENDA WITH BLITZ THROUGH LATIN AMERICA Blackwater founder Erik Prince walks with police officers during the Apolo 13 anti-crime operation April 5, 2025, in Guayaquil, Ecuador.(Agencia Press South/Getty Images) Noboa also called for the international community to provide military assistance and suggested the U.S. army could work with Ecuador to combat violent gangs. Despite the president’s hardline position on crime, January 2025 was Ecuador’smost violent monthin recent history, with 781 people killed. Noboa partnered with Erik Prince, founder of the private security firm Blackwater, and formed a strategic alliance in March to strengthen Ecuador’s ability to fight narcoterrorism. Ecuador’s National Police presents individuals detained during a police operation after gang clashes that resulted in multiple victims in Guayaquil, Ecuador, March 7, 2025.(Ecuador Interior Ministry/Handout via Reuters) InSight Crime, a nonprofit focusing on organized crime and security in the Americas, reports that Ecuador is one of the region’s \"most significant drug trafficking hubs\" and ships cocaine from Peru and Colombia to Central America, Mexico and Europe. Many of thesedrug trafficking organizationsworking through local proxies and other criminal groups have infiltrated the prison system and expanded its network of street gangs. The various groups operating throughout Ecuadorian society and within the prison system work with domestic and international drug traffickers, including the Sinaloa Cartel, considered one of the most powerful drug trafficking organizations in the world and responsible for a large amount of fentanyl trafficked into the U.S., according to the Department of Justice. President Noboa and González each received around 44% of the vote in the first round of the election. González is the leader of Citizen Revolution and is considered the heir of former President Correa. She's also looking to become the first female president of Ecuador. If she wins, Ecuador could see a return to the leftist economic policies of the Correa presidency.

Saúl Medina, a former governor of Tungurahua, told Fox News Digital that, after the electoral cycle, a comprehensive and determined strategy to combat gang violence must be enacted.

Valdez Duffao, Humire and other experts on Latin America agreed Noboa has ingratiated himself with President Trump. They are ideologically similar and, should Noboa win, it could put him in a better position to address the country’s endemic violence.",

    "article_text": "Lexington Institute Vice President Rebecca Grant breaks down President Donald Trump’s foreign policy strategy with Iran amid nuclear talks on ‘Fox Report.’ American andIranian officialssat down for a first round of direct talks Saturday in Oman, a major step after years of rising tensions and stalled diplomacy that will continue with further discussions next weekend, according to a statement released by the White House. The meeting between U.S. Special Envoy Steven Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was the first face-to-face exchange sincePresident Donald Trumpreturned to office as Iran continues to expand its nuclear program. The White House described the discussions as \"very positive and constructive,\" adding, \"the United States deeply thanks the Sultanate of Oman for its support of this initiative.\" Witkoff, joined by U.S. Ambassador to Oman Ana Escrogima, told Araghchi Trump had personally instructed him to try to resolve differences through diplomacy, if possible. DELEGATES FROM IRAN, US HOLDING TALKS IN OMAN AMID ONGOING TENSIONS: WHAT TO KNOW Steve Witkoff, White House special envoy for the Middle East, met with Iranian officials Saturday.(AP/Ben Curtis) The talks took place on the outskirts of Oman’s capital, Muscat, and lasted just over two hours. Omani Foreign Minister Said Badr hosted the meeting. Iranian state TV later confirmed the sides exchanged several rounds of messages, and there was a short, direct conversation between the American and Iranian diplomats. Military pressure appears to be a big reason Iran came to the table. Rebecca Grant, a senior fellow at the Lexington Institute, told the \"Fox Report\" Saturday the U.S. has sent a clear signal by movingpowerful military assetsinto the region. TRUMP DEMANDS DO-OR-DIE NUCLEAR TALKS WITH IRAN. WHO HAS THE LEVERAGE? \"All the options are not only on the table. They're all deployed to the Middle East,\" Grant said. \"Somewhere between four and six B-2 stealth bombers [are] forward in Diego Garcia, [along with] two aircraft carriers. That has really gotten Iran’s attention.\" Grant said Iran now faces a choice. \"Iran either has to talk or get their nuclear facilities bombed,\" she said. Tensions between the two countries have been high since 2018, when Trump pulled the U.S. out of the 2015 nuclear deal. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Donald Trump(Office of the Iranian Supreme Leader/WANA; Reuters/Elizabeth Frantz/File Photo) That agreement placed strict limits on Iran’s nuclear program. Since then, Iran has been enriching uranium at much higher levels. The latest report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says Iran is enriching uranium to 60% purity, just below weapons-grade, and has stockpiled over 18,000 pounds of it. Under the original deal, Iran was limited to 3.67% purity and a much smaller stockpile. WhileU.S. intelligence agenciesdo not believe Iran has started building a nuclear weapon, they warn the country is getting closer to being able to do so if it decides to. Gen. Jack Keane, a Fox News military analyst, said Iran’s leaders now believe Trump is serious about using military force if they don’t agree to limit Iran's nuclear program. \"They’ve come to the conclusion that the president is dead serious about supporting an Israeli-led, U.S.-supported strike on Iran to take down their nuclear enterprise,\" Keane said. An Iranian man holds an anti-U.S. poster during a rally in downtown Tehran.(Morteza Nikoubazl/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Grant explained that the U.S. and its allies are ready for such a strike if talks fail. \"Israel took out a lot of Iran’s air defenses last year,\" she said. \"Then you have two [U.S.] carriers, land-based fighters in the region and B-2 bombers with bunker-busting bombs. That’s the threat display.\" She added that Iran has no real need to enrich uranium since it can buy nuclear fuel on the open market. \"It is time for them to start to make a deal,\" she said. \"And I think, maybe, due to our military pressure and Trump’s resolve, they’re beginning to realize it.\" Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has said he’s not open to direct negotiations onthe nuclear programbut has also blamed the United States for breaking past promises. \"They must prove that they can build trust,\" Pezeshkian said in a recent Cabinet meeting.

Elizabeth Warrendefended her calls for the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate President Donald Trump over accusations of market manipulation and insider trading, saying such an investigation is \"entirely appropriate.\" \"That's what investigations are for. And it's entirely appropriate to have an investigation to make sure that Donald Trump, Donald Trump's family,Donald Trump'sinner circle didn't get advance information and trade on that information,\" Warren told CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday during an appearance on \"State of the Union.\" Warren, alongside a handful of other Senate Democrats such as Oregon's Ron Wyden and New York's Chuck Schumer, wrote a letter to the SEC chief on Friday calling for an investigation into alleged market manipulation following Trump's reciprocal tariff announcement and subsequent 90-day pause to the customized tariffs he leveled on foreign nations. \"We urge the SEC to investigate whether the tariff announcements, which caused the market crash and subsequent partial recovery, enriched administration insiders and friends at the expense of the American public and whether any insiders, including the President’s family, had prior knowledge of the tariff pause that they abused to make stock trades ahead of the President’s announcement,\" the Senate Democrats wrote in their letter to SEC Chair Paul Atkins on Friday.

And, by the way, Jake, the same thing should apply to Congress. And that is, we should have a rule that no one in Congress can… trade in any individual stocks, no senator, no representative.

Barbara Lee. EXCLUSIVE:Former Oakland City Council member Loren Taylor said former Rep. Barbara Lee's ties to the political establishment could help him towin over Oaklanderswho are \"fed up\" with the status quo ahead of the April 15 special election. A self-described political outsider who only served one term as a city council member after unseating a 16-year incumbent, Taylor shared his plans to bring change to the \"struggling\" Bay Area city in an interview with Fox News Digital. \"I am running as a political outsider who has just enough experience inside of City Hall to understand what's going on, but not so much that I'm entrenched in the political establishment. That is what Oaklanders are looking for,\" Taylor said. WhileLee – a former member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and 2024 Senate primary candidate – has name recognition and national experience, Taylor has made waves in Oakland's special electionas campaign finance reportsreveal he has outraised the career California politician. CALIFORNIA CITY'S MASSIVE $130M DEFICIT THREATENS DANGEROUS CUTS TO ITS FIREFIGHTING CAPACITY Former Oakland City Council member Loren Taylor, left, and former Rep. Barbara Lee, right, will face off on April 15 for Oakland's special election. \"We have raised more money than other candidates in this race from local residents,\" Taylor said. \"Over 80% of our contributions come directly from people who live right here in Oakland, compared to less than 50% for my primary component. That speaks volumes about who this campaign is. We are powered by Oaklanders, locals who are impacted by the decisions that are being made. The campaign is surging. Huge momentum these final days fueled by that overwhelming grassroots support.\" DEM MAYOR UNLEASHES TASK FORCE IN ATTEMPT TO RESCUE CRIME-RIDDEN CITY: 'RESTORE ORDER TO OUR STREETS' Oakland's staggering $129.8 budget deficit for Fiscal Year 2024-25 forced some Oakland firehouses to close their doors earlier this year. The City Council passed a resolution to reopen those firehouses, preventing tragedy from financial mismanagement. The liberal-run city has had four different mayors in a four-month period after formerMayor Sheng Thao was recalled this November andsubsequently indictedon eight counts of bribery. Oakland has been without a clear leader this year as the city continues to grapple with a homelessness crisis. Alameda County Health's January 2024Point-in-Time (PIT) reportfound there were 5,490 homeless individuals in Oakland in 2024, a 9% increase since 2022. \"Oaklanders are frustrated,\" Taylor explained. \"We are upset that we have not been getting what we deserve, what we should be getting from our local government. The status quo continues to fail us when we see crime rates rising out of control, we see homelessness still growing when it's shrinking in neighboring cities, we see our city facing the largest fiscal budget deficit in our history – a number of failures that show that what we have is not working.\" Homeless encampments line the streets in Oakland on March 15, 2024.(DWS for Fox News Digital) While theOakland Police Department reporteda decrease in violent crime in 2024, 2025 began with acrime surgeplagued by five recorded homicides within a 48-hour period.

They didn't grow up within the ranks of government. They had careers, were making a significant impact outside and saw the gaps that existed with local government.

    "title": "How Mike Johnson rescued Trump's tax agenda from jaws of likely defeat",
    "article_text": "White House senior counselor Peter Navarro defends the Trump administration's trade and tariff policies on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.' When lawmakers arrived on Capitol Hill last Monday, House GOP leaders' plans to sync up with the Senate on sweeping legislation to advance PresidentDonald Trump'sagenda seemed an all-but-impossible task. House fiscal hawks were furious with Senate Republicans for passing an amended version of the former's budget framework, one that called for a significantly lower amount of mandatory spending cuts than the House's initial plan. By late Thursday morning, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., was celebrating victory in front of reporters after a narrow 216-to-214 vote. \"I told you not to doubt us,\" a triumphant Johnson told the media. \"We’re really grateful to have had the big victory on the floor just now. It was a big one, a very important one.\" HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS CHAIR URGES JOHNSON TO CHANGE COURSE ON SENATE VERSION OF TRUMP BUDGET BILL Speaker of the House Mike Johnson shakes hands with President Donald Trump onstage at a House Republicans Conference meeting at the Hyatt Regency on Capitol Hill on Nov. 13, 2024 in Washington.(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) The hard-fought win came after long hours and late nights as House Republican leaders — and leaders in the Senate GOP as well — worked to persuade holdouts, while Trump and his aides worked those same critics from the sidelines. White House aides were at House Republicans' weekly conference meeting on Tuesday, a rare sight but not unexpected, given the importance of the coming vote. ButGOP lawmakersfiled out of that meeting doubting whether Trump's influence could help this time, after he played a key role in helping shepherd earlier critical bills across the finish line this year. \"I don't see it happening,\" a House Republican told Fox News Digital when asked whether Trump would be enough to sway critics. Nevertheless, a select group of those holdouts were summoned to the White House alongside House GOP leaders on Wednesday afternoon, hours before the expected vote. MEET THE TRUMP-PICKED LAWMAKERS GIVING SPEAKER JOHNSON A FULL HOUSE GOP CONFERENCE Fox News Digital was told that Trump commanded the room for roughly 20 to 30 minutes, and told House conservatives he agreed with them on the need to significantly slash government spending. Trump also communicated to holdouts that Senate leaders felt the same, but, like the House, were working on their own tight margins, Fox News Digital was told. The president, meanwhile, has been concerned in particular with the looming debt limit deadline, Fox News Digital was told. It's one of the issues that Republicans are looking to tackle via the budget reconciliation process. By lowering the Senate's passage threshold from 60 votes to 51, it allows the party controlling the House, Senate and White House to enact broad policy changes via one or two broad pieces of legislation. Senate Majority Leader John Thune speaks during a news conference following the Senate Republican policy luncheon at the U.S. Capitol in Washington on Tuesday, March 11, 2025.(Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images) In this case, Republicans are looking for some added funds for border security and defense and to raise the debt ceiling — while paring back spending on the former Biden administration's green energy policies and in other sections of the federal government, likely including entitlement programs. GOP lawmakers are also looking to extend Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the provisions of which expire at the end of this year. They will also need new funding for Trump's efforts to eliminate taxes on tipped and overtime wages. But first, Republicans wanted the House and Senate to pass identical frameworks setting the stage for filling those frameworks with actual legislative policy. Whereas the House version calls for at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts, the Senate mandated a floor of $4 billion — a wide gap to bridge. The Wednesday-afternoon White House meeting did sway some holdouts, but far from enough. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., also met with House GOP critics of the bill for more than an hour on Wednesday evening ahead of the planned vote. \"He couldn't have been more cordial and understanding in talking to us about what we needed to know. And honestly, he had some of the same concerns that we did,\" Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., told Fox News Digital. \"You know, he's got to get it over the finish line, and he had to make certain commitments. But he committed to us to work with us.\" Ultimately, however, plans to advance the measure that evening were hastily scrapped as an unrelated vote was held open for over an hour, leading to confusion and frustration on the House floor. \"He looked like he was in no better spot than he was at the beginning,\" one House Republican said of that night. Rep. Tim Burchett speaks with reporters at the U.S. Capitol.(Alex Wong) Trump was not called to address the group during that huddle with holdouts, two sources in the room told Fox News Digital. However, the president did have individual conversations with some holdouts on Wednesday and Thursday, one person said. The Wednesday night failure gave way to a late night of negotiations involving both holdouts and House GOP leaders. Two House GOP leadership aides told Fox News Digital that Johnson had huddled with Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., and House GOP Conference Chairwoman Lisa McClain, R-Mich., until late Wednesday to figure out a path forward. When they emerged shortly before midnight, they had settled on a plan — a televised promise by Johnson and Thune to put both leaders on the record committing to deep spending cuts. SENATE GOP PUSHES TRUMP BUDGET FRAMEWORK THROUGH AFTER MARATHON VOTE SERIES \"I'm happy to tell you that this morning, I believe we have the votes to finally adopt the budget resolution so we can move forward on President Trump's very important agenda for the American people,\" Johnson said. Thune added, \"We are aligned with the House in terms of what their budget resolution outlined in terms of savings. The speaker has talked about $1.5 trillion. We have a lot of United States senators who believe in that as a minimum.\" A senior Senate GOP aide argued to Fox News Digital, \"Absent Thune’s intervention, Mike Johnson would not have gotten this resolution through the House.\" But the speaker was also putting in his own long hours with holdouts. Steve Scalise, House majority leader, speaks during Day 2 of the Republican National Convention (RNC), at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee on July 16, 2024.(Reuters/Mike Segar) The office of Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., who ultimately voted to advance the framework, told Fox News Digital that critics were sent a memo by Johnson early on Thursday, assuring them that he was committed to deep spending cuts. \"The Senate amendment to H. Con. Res. 14 preserves untouched language from the original House-passed resolution, including the reconciliation instructions to House committees and Section 4001 — Adjustment for spending cuts of at least $2 trillion,\" the memo said. It referred to a measure in the House-passed framework that suggested funding toward tax cuts would be reduced by a corresponding amount if final spending cuts did not equal $2 trillion. \"This language reflects a critical principle — that deficit-increasing provisions of the final reconciliation bill are accompanied by concomitant spending cuts,\" it said. Then, as the vote was called around 10:30 a.m. on Thursday morning, a final huddle between holdouts and leaders sealed the Republicans' victory. \"At some point, it was heated. And then the speaker's leadership team [House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn.] made sure we were clarified on some issues which are very important to some of the members,\" Burchett said. \"And then Steve Scalise, really batting cleanup, and he came in with the final with the final conclusion, which everybody agreed to pretty much. And then the speaker closed the deal.\" House GOP Conference Chair Lisa McClain leaves a meeting at the Capitol Hill Club on Feb. 28, 2023.(Tom Williams) Burchett said he believed that Johnson had spoken to Trump separately at some point during that huddle. A senior House GOP aide said McClain was also present for that meeting. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Republicansclinched the winminutes after 11 a.m. on Thursday, with the GOP side of the House chamber erupting in applause. House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris, R-Md., who helped lead the opposition, told reporters after the vote, \"We made tremendous progress over the last two days in making certain that whatever we do on reconciliation, we don't increase this country's budget deficit.\" \"We take theMoody reportfrom two weeks ago pretty seriously, that you can't have unpaid-for tax cuts, and we made progress in making, getting assurances both from the Senate and the House leadership that that's not going to occur,\" Harris said.

Gretchen Whitmer has \"done an excellent job\" and called her a \"very good person.\" (Credit: X/ @RapidResponse47) Michigan Gov.Gretchen Whitmer,a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, was ribbed online for seeming to hide her face during a meeting with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office. Whitmer was seen temporarily shielding her face from cameras in the Oval Office by holding up a folder, according to a photo bythe New York Times. She later lowered the folder, as the president spoke to the press and encouraged Whitmer to comment as well.The Democratic governor,who clashed with Trump during his first term regarding her COVID-19 lockdown policies, met with the president to discuss recovery from an ice storm that impacted thousands of Michiganders, funding for the Selfridge Air National Guard base near Detroit, protections for the Great Lakes and the automobile industry.

Gretchen Whitmer gestures to President Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House on Wednesday, April 9, 2025, in Washington.(Pool via AP) Whitmer, joined by Michigan State House Speaker Matt Hall and several Cabinet secretaries, stood steps away from Trump while he signed executive orders Wednesday. \"We're honored to have Gretchen Whitmer from Michigan, great state of Michigan. And, she's been -- she's really done an excellent job. And a very good person,\" Trump said. Whitmer told reporters afterward that she thought she was coming into the Oval Office for a one-on-one meeting with the president and was taken by surprise by the press conference. Her face-shielding was derided online. \"Whitmercovering her face is the perfect metaphor for the Democratic Party,\" one user wrote.

Some users joked that Whitmer was \"embarrassed\" to be photographed with Trump but had no shame in placing a Dorito in the mouth of a podcaster in a 2024 social media post that critics saidmocked a Christian sacrament. The photo showed Whitmer hiding her face while standing in between Trump aide Natalie Harpe and Deputy Assistant to the President and White House Director of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs Alex Myer. Myer shared the photo on X, writing: \"#NewProfilePic.\" Whitmer was in Washington to deliver a \"Build, America, Build\" address in which she called for bipartisan cooperation to strengthen American manufacturing. She was at the White House for her second meeting with Trump in less than a month, this time to talk about tariffs that were expected to disproportionately affect Michigan, whose economy is closely tied to an auto industry reliant on trade with Canada, Mexico and other countries. In her speech Wednesday, which came before Trump announced he was pausing tariffs in most nations except for China, Whitmer highlightedareas of agreement with Trumpon tariffs but criticized how they had been implemented.

Gretchen Whitmer looks on as President Donald Trump signs executive orders in the Oval Office of the White House on April 9, 2025.(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) \"I understand the motivation behind the tariffs, and I can tell you, here’s where President Trump and I do agree. We do need to make more stuff in America,\" said Whitmer, before adding, \"I’m not against tariffs outright, but it is a blunt tool. You can’t just pull out the tariff hammer to swing at every problem without a clear defined end-goal.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Whitmer’s approach stands in stark contrast to that of other high-profile Democratic governors, many of whom are also seen as potential contenders for the party’s 2028 presidential nomination. But Whitmer faces a more challenging political landscape than leaders such as Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker orCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsomas she represents a state with a divided state legislature and that went for Trump in two of the last three elections. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

    "title": "Creatine may not build more muscle after all, study suggests",
    "article_text": "Director of Operations for Retro Fitness Amanda Pienkos joins ‘Fox & Friends Weekend’ to give advice on straight training. Creatine is a popular supplement used to help build muscle, but researchers in Australia are questioning its effectiveness. Investigators from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Sydney found that individuals who took creatine while performing a three-monthweightlifting regimenput on the same amount of muscle as those who did not take the supplement while lifting. That’s according to their recent study, which was published in the journal Nutrients. COMMON SUPPLEMENT COULD HELP YOU LIVE LONGER, RESEARCH SUGGESTS \"We’ve shown that taking 5 grams of creatine supplement per day does not make any difference to the amount of lean muscle mass people put on whileresistance training,\" senior author Mandy Hagstrom, PhD, an exercise scientist from UNSW’s School of Health Sciences, said in a news release about the study. The clinical trial looked at 54 relativelyhealthy participantsranging from 18 to 50 years old who were divided into two groups. Creatine is a popular supplement used to help build muscle, but researchers in Australia are questioning its effectiveness.(iStock) Both groups completed the same 12-week resistance training, comprised of three supervised workouts a week. COMMON VITAMIN SHOWN TO REDUCE AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE The creatine group took the supplement one week prior to beginning the training regimen, referred to as a \"wash-in,\" and continued taking the 5-gram dose each day for a total of 13 weeks while performing the exercise routine. The control group received no creatine or placebo during the workout period. \"This is the first creatine study to utilize a wash-in phase, which is standard in other clinical trial designs,\" Hagstrom told Fox News Digital. Investigators found that individuals who took creatine while performing a three-month weightlifting regimen put on the same amount of muscle as those who did not take the supplement while lifting.(iStock) \"This allows the effect of thecreatine supplementto be separated from the effect of resistance training.\" Previous trials have started supplementation and exercise programs on the same day, she noted, which made it difficult to determine the impact of each. The researchers looked at lean muscle body mass in both groups at baseline, then after the seven-day wash-in and after completion of the 12-week weight-lifting program. \"Taking 5 grams of creatine supplement per day does not make any difference to the amount of lean muscle mass people put on while [doing] resistance training.\" They used \"dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry\" — which is a non-invasive imaging technique — to measure bone mineral density and body composition. While the creatine-supplemented group (particularly the women) showed about a one-pound gain in lean body mass compared to the non-supplemented group at the seven-day mark, both groups showed a 4.4-pound gain after performing the 12-week resistance training program. There was no difference between the two groups when it came to lean body mass growth, according to the study. \"Our research found that creatine supplements are not effective for building lean body mass with strength training when taken at the recommended maintenance dose, but there are many other benefits of creatine that were not assessed in our study,\" a researcher told Fox News Digital.(iStock) \"The people taking thecreatine supplementsaw changes before they even started exercising, which leads us to believe that it wasn’t actual real muscle growth, but potentially fluid retention,\" Hagstrom said. Once the participants started exercising, they saw no additional benefit from creatine, she said — \"which suggests that 5 grams per day is not enough if you’re taking it for the purposes of building muscle.\" STRICT FASTING DIET HELPED GOLFER PHIL MICKELSON LOSE 25 POUNDS The participants did not do a typical creatine-loading phase, which involves taking 20 to 25 grams a day for up to a week to try to saturate the muscles’ creatine stores, the study authors stated in the news release. While it is common to start with a loading phase dose, it can causegastrointestinal issues, they noted. Hagstrom’s team said more research is needed to determine whether a higher dose, such as 10 mg, is needed to achieve the desired lean body mass growth effect. (This higher dose has shown benefits for bone andbrain health.) \"Our research found that creatine supplements are not effective for building lean body mass with strength training when taken at the recommended maintenance dose, but there are many other benefits of creatine that were not assessed in our study,\" Hagstrom told Fox News Digital. The creatine group took the supplement one week prior to beginning the training regimen and continued taking the 5-gram dose each day for a total of 13 weeks while performing the exercise routine.(iStock) Another area of interest for future studies is whether creatine may have along-term benefit, according to Imtiaz Desai, one of the study authors. \"When you start weight training, you have those beginner gains in strength, which start tapering off around the 12-week mark and become slower, so it’s possible the support from creatine might come at a later stage,\" Desai said in the news release. Makenzi Mollitor, a registered sports dietitian at TSI: The Schwarz Institute in Massapequa, New York, commented on the study to Fox News Digital. She said she prefers a\"food-first\" approachwhen it comes to taking supplements. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Putting on muscle takes a combination of nutrition and resistance training,\" Mollitor, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital. Those looking to build muscle should prioritize nutrition around their resistance training schedule, she advised. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER \"Eating a combination ofprotein and carbohydratesalmost immediately after training — ideally within the hour — will help to promote muscle growth and repair,\" said Mollitor, who works with Division 1 athletes at Long Island University in New York. \"By prioritizing protein, you will also be consuming creatine, because creatine is naturally found in protein sources such as meat, poultry and fish,\" she added. \"If you are someone who doesn’t eat a lot of animal protein or is vegan/vegetarian, a supplement could help fill those gaps.\" Supplements do have their place, however, according to the expert. \"If you are someone who doesn’t eat a lot of animal protein or isvegan/vegetarian, a supplement could come in handy to help fill those gaps,\" she said.

He and her doctors decided it would be less risky to remove the pig's kidney than to try saving it. \"We did the safe thing,\" Montgomery told the AP. \"She’s no worse off than she was before (the xenotransplant) and she would tell you she’s better off because she had this 4½ month break from dialysis.\" Looney suffered an infection prior and her immune-suppressing anti-rejection drugs were slightly lowered, Montgomery said. At the same time, her immune system was reactivating after the transplant. Those factors may have combined to damage the new kidney, he said.

    "title": "Ancient landmark Hagia Sophia, 'simply unique, without parallel,' attracts long line of tourists",
    "article_text": "Michel Picaud, president of Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris, shares updates on the restoration of the Notre Dame Cathedral in France five years after a fire shut the site down. When Western tourists who are visiting Istanbul, Turkey, cruise into a port, many typically look for one particular landmark: the Hagia Sophia. Identifying the ancient temple, which has served as achurch, museumand mosque, may be tricky from a distance. Istanbul’s skyline appears to be peppered with look-alike large mosques with Byzantine-style domes and tall minarets surrounding them. There is the Süleymaniye Mosque, built in the 16th century to rivalthe Hagia Sophia, on the orders of Sultan Süleyman, according to Britannica. EXPERTS SHOCKED BY ANCIENT KING ARTHUR MANUSCRIPT FOUND TUCKED INSIDE BOOK: ‘SURVIVED THE CENTURIES’ Then there is the Blue Mosque, an Ottoman-era temple just a short walk from the famous landmark, followed by many other similar structures. The Hagia Sophia Grand Mosque is a Muslim place of worship — but that is not the reason it attracts so much attention. The European side of Istanbul, Turkey, is seen above. For almost 1,000 years, it was a Christian basilica, the largest and most spectacular temple not just in Constantinople, but in theentire Byzantine Empire. \"Hagia Sophia is simply unique, without parallel,\" Robert Nelson, Robert Lehman Professor of the History of Art, emeritus, Yale University, told Fox News Digital. \"The height of its dome was not surpassed until the building of St. Peters Basilica in the 16th century. Even more impressive than just its size is its beautiful, lavish marble decoration inside.\" The Blue Mosque, properly known as the Sultan Ahmed Mosque, was built between 1609-1616, according to Britannica.(Danuta Hamlin/Fox News) \"Massive marble columns were brought from around the ancient world. The walls are sheathed in handsome marbles that have dulled over time but still impress,\" he said. It was commissioned by Eastern Roman Emperor Justinian I and designed by two Greek architects and mathematicians, Isidore of Miletus and Anthemius of Tralles. The Hagia Sophia, a major historical monument, was commissioned by Emperor Justinian the Great.(History/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) No wonderthis architectural marvelis frequently called the eighth wonder of the world. \"Justinian dreamed of an entirely new kind of church,\" wrote Italian Renaissance scholar Frederick Hartt. And Justinian got exactly what he wanted. ANCIENT STRUCTURE USED FOR CULT 'RITUALS' DISCOVERED BY ARCHAEOLOGISTS \"Solomon, I have vanquished thee!\" the imaginative emperor reportedly boasted upon the completion of his magnificent basilica. The Hagia Sophia was built in the 6th century AD in Constantinople, the Byzantine Empire.(Danuta Hamlin/Fox News) The bottom line is that the Hagia Sophia is ancient, built between 532 and 537 AD — andtourists can still set footinside it and soak in all its glory. \"The glorious impression of harmoniously blended space and light we receive in the interior today should be supplemented in imagination by visualizing the majestic procession of the Byzantine emperor and his court,\" wrote Hartt. Morning light penetrates the interior of the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, Turkey.(Danuta Hamlin/Fox News) The Hagia Sophia is grand and awe-inspiring — and makes visitors wonder how people so many centuries ago managed to engineer such a complex structure. Then again, this is about the Greeks. After a 6th century earthquake, the Hagia Sophia in Instanbul dome suffered damage and was redesigned by Isidorus the Younger.(Danuta Hamlin/Fox News) When the basilica was erected, Constantinople, perched at the eastern end of the European continent and named after emperor Constantine the Great, was one of the most important capitals of Christendom.

It was known for its state-of-the-art fortifications. A 13th-century representation of the Virgin Mary, Christ and John the Baptist at the Hagia Sophia, Istanbul, Turkey.(Danuta Hamlin/Fox News) After the Great Schism of 1054, which broke Christianity intoRoman Catholicand Eastern Orthodox communions, things got a bit complicated. Constantinople remained the center of the Greek Orthodox church, but its power was weakened. In April 1182, an event took place known in history as the Massacre of the Latins. As Donald M. Nicoldescribed it in his book\"Byzantium and Venice,\" \"The people needed no encouragement. With an enthusiasm fired by years of resentment, they set about the massacre of all the foreigners that they could find… At the end, some 4,000 westerners who had survived the massacre were rounded up and sold as slaves to the Turks. Those who had escaped by ship took their revenge by burning and looting the Byzantine monasteries on the coasts and islands of the Aegean Sea.\" ANCIENT JEWISH RITUAL BATH, OLDEST OF ITS KIND IN EUROPE, UNCOVERED BY ARCHAEOLOGISTS In 1204, Constantinople was sacked by the crusaders in retaliation for the massacre and held by the West for several decades, according to numerous sources. In 1453, trouble came from the Asian side. The city was sacked again — this time by the Turks — and incorporated into the Ottoman Empire. The Istanbul skyline is pictured in 2024.(Danuta Hamlin/Fox News) As a result, the Basilica of Hagia Sophia was turned into a mosque and minarets were added. \"Hagia Sophia had an immediate effect on the Ottomans after they conquered the city and Sultan Mehmed II, the conqueror, declared that it should not be harmed. It wasto be his mosqueand remained the principal mosque of the city for some time,\" Nelson told Fox News Digital. \"Ottoman architects, beginning in the later 15th century, strove to copy its dome and interior.\" Four minarets were added when the Hagia Sophia became a mosque.(Danuta Hamlin) Historians say the Ottoman Empire grew in power, spreading into Africa and eastern parts of Europe, menacing towns, raiding villages, taking inhabitants into slavery. At the time when theWestern Europeanpowers were engaging in exploration and expanding their territories into the New World, their eastern counterparts were busy defending their own borders.

A gift shop in Istanbul, Turkey, is shown above.(Danuta Hamlin/Fox News) Confident that this time they would conquer Vienna, the vast Ottoman force, led by Kara Mustafa, was instead crushed by Sobieski and his Polish-heavy cavalry, the famed winged hussars. Pope Innocent XI hailed Sobieski as the \"savior of Vienna and Western European civilization.\" King Jan Sobieski wrote to his wife, Queen Maria Kazimiera: \"God Our Lord blessed for eternity has granted a victory and glory to our nation, the like of which was never heard of in centuries past,\" according to the Museum of King Jan III’s Palace at Wilanow and from a letter translated by Klaudyna Michałowicz. King John III Sobieski is shown sending a message of victory to Pope Innocent Xi after the battle of Vienna, by Jan Matejko.(Fine Art Images/Heritage Images/Getty Images) The battle of Vienna marked the beginning of the decline of the Ottoman Empire, but the city of Constantinople on the Bosporus Strait, a natural waterway dividing Europe and Asia, remained in Turkish hands.

Over the years, the former basilica and mosque underwent significant renovations and became a favorite among tourists. But in 2020, despite many objections from UNESCO and international communities, the government of Turkey rescinded Hagia Sophia's museum status and turned it back into a working mosque. In 2024, the Turkish ministry of culture and tourism completed a digital scan of Hagia Sophia, creating a \"digital twin\" of the temple to make sure they could rebuild it if ever needed.(Danuta Hamlin/Fox News) Tourists are now allowedto enter only the upper level (the gallery) of this historic building and view its interior from above. It does not slow them down, however. There are long lines to purchase tickets for those who have not secured tickets online.  Also, female visitors must cover their heads upon entering.

    "article_text": "SOLVA Archaeology Service in Belgium announced the recent discovery of ancient Roman artifacts and remains, including a well-preserved dog, in Velzeke. (Source: SOLVA Dienst Archeologie) Historians recently unveiled a rare 13th-century document depicting the tales of King Arthur and Merlin – and its survival is considered a miracle. The discovery was announced by the University of Cambridge on March 25. The manuscript is part of the Suite Vulgate du Merlin, a French-language rendering of the story of King Arthur. Arthur has been depicted as a legendary Briton king for several centuries, though his existence has been doubted by most historians. ANCIENT TEN COMMANDMENTS FRAGMENT OF 2,000-YEAR-OLD MANUSCRIPT GOES ON DISPLAY AT REAGAN LIBRARY In 2019, the fragile manuscript was discovered in an unlikely place in a Cambridge library – tucked in as the binding for anold book. \"The manuscript had survived the centuries after being recycled and repurposed in the 1500s as the cover for a property record fromHuntingfield Manor in Suffolk, owned by the Vanneck family of Heveningham,\" the university's statement noted. Cambridge University historians recently unveiled a rare literary depiction of King Arthur.(Cambridge University Library / CHIL) \"It meant theremarkable discoverywas folded, torn and even stitched into the binding of the book - making it almost impossible for Cambridge experts to access it, read it or confirm its origins,\" the university said in a news release. Thanks to modern technology – including multi-spectral imaging, computed tomography and 3D modeling – experts were able to scan and create a virtual image of the manuscript without risking any damage to it. ANCIENT JEWISH RITUAL BATH, OLDEST OF ITS KIND IN EUROPE, UNCOVERED BY ARCHAEOLOGISTS \"Using mirrors, prisms, magnets and other tools, the team at CHIL [Cultural Heritage Imaging Laboratory] carefully photographed each section of the fragment,\" the university said. \"The hundreds of resulting images were then painstakinglyreassembled digitally,much like a jigsaw, to create a coherent image of the text.\" \"By manipulating the digital images, the team could simulate what the document might look like if it were physically opened.\" Each copy of the Suite Vulgate du Merlin was unique, having been written individually by scribes, the university said.(Cambridge University Library / CHIL) Each copy of the Suite Vulgate du Merlin was unique, as they were individually handwritten by medieval scribes, and fewer than 40 copies are known to exist. The Cambridge copy was written between 1275 and 1315. \"The text is written in Old French, the language of the court and aristocracy in medieval England following the Norman Conquest,\" the news release said. \"This particular fragment belongs to the genre of Arthurian romances [that] were intended for a noble audience, including women.\" For more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle The university added that the manuscript \"tells two key episodes from the end of the Suite Vulgate du Merlin.\" \"The first part recounts the victory of the Christians against the Saxons at the Battle of Cambénic,\" the statement reads. \"It tells of the fight of Gauvain (with his sword Excalibur, his horse Gringalet and his supernatural powers), his brothers, and his father King Loth, against the Saxon Kings Dodalis, Moydas, Oriancés and Brandalus.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER It went on, \"The second passage presents a morecourtly scene,set on the Feast of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, with Merlin appearing at Arthur's court disguised as a harpist – a moment that highlights his magical abilities and his importance as an advisor to the king.\" Experts used modern technology to \"virtually unwrap\" the manuscript without damaging it.(Cambridge University Library / CHIL) The University of Cambridge even included a translated passage from the book, which painted a vivid scene of life inmedieval England. \"While they were rejoicing in the feast, and Kay the seneschal brought the first dish to King Arthur and Queen Guinevere, there arrived the most handsome man ever seen in Christian lands,\" the passage read. \"He was wearing a silk tunic girded by a silk harness woven with gold and precious stones which glittered with such brightness that it illuminated the whole room.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The fragile document even contains small errors – such as calling theSaxon kingDodalis \"Dorilas\" – but those errors will only help specialists trace the manuscript's lineage. \"As every manuscript of the period was copied by hand, it means each one is distinctive and reflects the variations introduced by medieval scribes,\" the British university said. The recently unveiled document paints a vivid picture of life in medieval England.(Cambridge University Library / CHIL) \"The way the manuscript has been carefully executed, with decorated initials in red and blue, gave further clues to its origins and helped indicate that it was produced between the end of the 13th and the beginning of the 14th century.\" Andrea Margolis is a writer for Fox News Digital and Fox Business.

It hides your online activities and helps keep your personal information safe when you’re using the internet, especially onpublic Wi-Fi. In addition to protecting your information from prying eyes, a VPN also hides your real location. It allows you to connect to the internet through a server in another part of the world, which makes it appear as though you’re browsing from a different location. This is useful for security (protecting your privacy) and for accessing content that might be restricted in certain areas. When you connect to public Wi-Fi at a coffee shop or airport, your data can be exposed to hackers and snoops. That’s where aVPN (virtual private network)comes in. It encrypts your internet traffic and routes it through a secure server, hiding your IP address and protecting your activity.

    "article_text": "It's like a real-life WALL-E, but with even more personality. Ready fora robotthat not only looks human but also acts and reacts like one, expressing emotions like shyness, excitement or friendliness? Disney Research, the innovation powerhouse behind The Walt Disney Company, has turned this into reality. Its latest creation is an autonomous humanoid robot that can mimic human emotions and behaviors in real time. Think of it as a real-life WALL-E, but with even more personality. This groundbreaking robot uses advancedartificial intelligenceto replicate natural gestures and deliberate actions with striking accuracy. What makes it truly special is how it learns by observing and mimicking human operators who guide its emotional responses during interactions. Over time, the robot becomes capable of engaging with people on its own, making every interaction feel personal and lifelike. STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS — SIGN UP FOR KURT’S THE CYBERGUY REPORT NOW Autonomous humanoid robot can mimic human emotions and behaviors(Disney Research) The secret sauce behind this emotional robot lies in its training process. Initially, a human operator remotely controlled the robot, using instincts and social intuition to guide its behavior. For example, if someone approached the robot shyly, the operator would respond in kind, teaching the robot how to mirror that emotion. These interactions were recorded and fed into an AI system that analyzed every movement and response. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Disney Research explains it best: \"Our model learns to predict continuous operator commands through a diffusion process and discrete commands through a classifier.\" In simpler terms, the AI learns two things, smooth movements (like waving) and specific actions (like saying hello). After extensive training in simulations, the robot was tested with real people, and it nailed it. Users could even recognize different \"moods\" generated by the robot’s AI. This autonomous humanoid robot can mimic human emotions and behaviors.(Disney Research) WORLD’S FIRST AI-POWERED INDUSTRIAL SUPER-HUMANOID ROBOT Behind this innovation is Newton,an open-source physics enginedeveloped by Disney Research in collaboration with NVIDIA and Google DeepMind. Newton is designed to close the \"sim-to-real\" gap in robotics by creating ultra-realistic virtual environments where robots can be trained efficiently. This means robots can practice complex tasks, like interacting with soft objects or navigating tricky terrains, before stepping into the real world. Newton’s capabilities are impressive: Disney plans to use Newton to enhance its robotic character platform, which includes expressive droids like the Star Wars-inspired BDX models showcased at NVIDIA’s GTC keynote this year.

    "title": "DAVID MARCUS: Sorry Stephen A. Smith, Democrats don’t let outsiders win their primaries",
    "article_text": "Fox News contributor Joe Concha discusses the state of the Democratic Party and the Los Angeles Dodgers' White House visit. In his decades covering sports, Stephen A. Smith has seen a lot of cheating and dirty tricks, but it’s nothing compared to what he'd face in a longshotbid for the Democratic nominationfor president. Those who run the nation’s oldest political party will not just hand Smith the car keys. In fact, they will do everything they can to destroy his nascent political career, even if that means destroying him. STEPHEN A. SMITH SAYS HE'S STRONGLY CONSIDERING PRESIDENTIAL RUN On Sunday, Smith appeared on ABC’s \"This Week,\" after confirming last week that he is not ruling out a run at the highest office in the land. And after all, you might say, if a celebrity like Donald Trump can find himself residing at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., then why not Stephen A. Smith? The answer to that question is that Democrats are not Republicans. Just ask Robert F Kennedy, Jr., who Democrats denied any opportunity to challenge Joe Biden in the 2024 primary, and who now works for Trump. Hillary Clinton defeated Senator Bernie Sanders in the 2016 primary, with an assist from party leaders. The party didn’t just try todefeat RFK Jr., they sought to humiliate and marginalize him. Smith should take heed. Democrats do not go with the hot hand just to win. If they did,Bernie Sanders would've been their nomineein 2016, not Hillary Clinton. And they proved it again atSanders' expense in 2020, when they pushed him aside for Joe Biden. Democrats want someone from their club, or at least someone they can control. Stephen A. Smith is neither. To be sure, there is a very positive case to be made for Smith as the Democratic Party wanders through the political wilderness, shivering in the long cold shadow of Biden’s incompetence and decrepitude. Smith is obviously a gifted communicator, and more than that, he appeals to the Achilles heel of the party, working-class men. He also appears more or less immune to wacky woke ideas like men playing in women’s sports. Stephen A. Smith is considering a run for president.(Kirby Lee-Imagn Images) Smith has an undeniable everyman appeal. After all, almost by definition a sports analyst is the guy you want to have a beer with, and even in that world, Smith balances the brutishness of sport with high-mindedness and impeccable style. His wildly successful career in the aggressive and high-stakes world of sports media is an asset for Smith. Before voters can agree with what a politician has to say, they have to want to hear what they have to say. Smith knows how to get attention. But before we start designing the fully lit basketball court in the Rose Garden, it is worth considering the extensive tools that the Democrats’ elite have to thwart Smith, a set of tools that, had they had them, Republicans would have used to kneecap Trump in 2016. First of all, superdelegates, which is to say unelected party insiders who cast ballots for the nominee at the party convention, play a vastly bigger role in the Democrats’ primary process than in the GOP’s. Added to this, given the dominance of Democrats in our major urban areas, local Democratic Party machines play an outsized role. It was Rep. James Clyburn’s get-out-the-vote effort in South Carolina cities that propelled Biden to his 2020 win, even though just a week earlier his candidacy had looked dead as a doornail. The party elders pick the candidates, whether the voters like it or not. Let’s not forget that just five months ago Kamala Harris ran for president, having never won a primary. Does it really matter how many votes Smith can get in a party that anoints nominees nobody voted for? CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION In 2016, Donald Trump didn’t so much win the Republican nomination for president as he did take over the GOP, fundamentally transforming it in ways we are still seeing play out with young and working-class voters, and with tariffs and peace deals. To become president, Stephen A. Smith would have to likewise. It wouldn't be enough to simply get the most votes for the Democratic nomination. He would have to fundamentally change the party itself, and the power structures within it, like Trump did. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As talented as Smith is, changing the Democratic Party is likely too tall an order for anyone. It is a machine designed to minimize voter impact. If Smith really wants to be president someday, he’d probably have a better chance running as a Republican. But that is a column for another day.

    "title": "SEN TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Why Trump's pattern of purging our highest-performing military officers is dangerous",
    "article_text": "Lt. General John Caine faces questioning by Democratic senators during his confirmation hearing about the Signal war chat leak. \"Our standards will be high,uncompromisingand clear.\" --Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s Message to the Force, January 25, 2025 PresidentDonald Trump’spick for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, retired Lt. Gen. Dan Caine (retired), possesses an extraordinary record of service—in Iraq, in special access programs and in the National Guard. There is no question of his capacity to lead, devotion to our country, character, courage or competence. But those aren’t the qualifications required by law to be the senior-most military officer in our Armed Forces. Federal law requires the chairman to be active duty and have served in any of three senior roles: vice chairman, service chief (except the Coast Guard) or commander of a combatant command. Caine fails to meet one of these. The president can waive most of the qualifications if he determines it is in our \"national interest.\" But the only justification that President Trump has stated for waiving these legal standards in this instance is that he remembers Caine stating he \"loved\" Trump, would \"kill\" for Trump and that Caine proudly donned a MAGA hat which—as Trump gushed—would be a violation of federal law. GENERAL WHO HELPED TRUMP DECIMATE ISIS TERRORISTS IN FIRST TERM CONFIRMED AS JOINT CHIEFS CHAIRMAN Strangely, Caine has categorically denied that he ever did any of those things, which means either Caine lied—under oath—or that he told the truth and Trump has no justification. To President Trump, the \"national interest\" appears to mean personal loyalty. The nomination of Caine is just the latest example in a dangerous pattern of President Trump purging—in multiple reckless and sudden bursts—the military of its highest-performing general officers from mission-critical roles. Why? Because they promised loyalty to the Constitution instead of to him? These firings have nothing to do with upholding high standards at all—they are about prioritizing fealty over qualifications and putting our national security at risk in the process. The only reason this chairmanship vacancy exists in the first place is because President Trump unceremoniously fired, without cause, Gen. CQ Brown Jr., who was serving—and excelling—in the role. Gen. Brown didn’t just meet the legal qualifications to be chairman—he embodied them. He brought his 40 years of honorable service in the Air Force to overseeing U.S. military operations in at least six active war zones and advised the defense secretary on responses to three tense international crises. Prior to being chairman, Gen. Brown served as chief of staff of the Air Force, commanded Pacific Air Forces and flew more than 3,100 hours with over 130 in combat. By firing such an exemplary officer and replacing him with someone who President Trump—rightly or wrongly—believes declared fealty to him, our commander-in-chief is sending a dangerous message to the force that loyalty, not expertise or even a commitment to upholding the law, will be rewarded. The disgraceful treatment of Gen. Brown was not an isolated incident. President Trump has fired at least 10 expertsenior military officers, most of whom were women or people of color, and several of whom—unlike Caine—met the legal qualifications to be chairman. These were warriors at the top of their game: Adm. Lisa Franchetti, the Navy’s first woman to serve as chief of naval operations, who had more than two decades of experience that included commanding carrier strike groups and destroyers. Adm. Linda Fagan, the first female Coast Guard commandant, who led on all seven continents. Lt. Gen. Jennifer Short, a command pilot who completed more than 1,800 flight hours during her 30-year career. Lt. Gen. Telita Crosland, who was pushed out from the Defense Health Agency after her 32-year career, which included serving as the deputy for all medical operations. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION And just this month, Trump fired Vice Adm. Shoshana Chatfield, who had a storied 36-year career, including serving as the first female president of the Naval War College, as well as Gen. Tim Haugh, the high-performing commander of U.S. Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency. These were all extraordinarily qualified military leaders summarily fired, with Trump choosing to replace them by nominating deeply unqualified appointees—while at the same time shouting that he only hires the \"best, most qualified\" people. Trump’s hiring decisions make a mockery of meritocracy, disrespect our service members’ sacrifices and do nothing to strengthen our force or our national security. Evenfive previous secretaries of defenseagreed that \"none of this is about warfighting.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Installing loyalists at the top of the military is the kind of thing autocrats do when they are trying to seize control of government. Trump is aiming to ingrain a culture of fear that makes it harder for our service members to speak truth to power and uphold their oath to support and defend the Constitution. What we saw happen with the nomination of Caine is not an aberration. It is part of a deliberate purge of expertise from our military that is eroding the very institution the American people rely on to keep them safe. MyRepublican colleaguesneed to stop enabling Trump’s dictatorial tendencies and start doing more to protect the service members who’ve sacrificed so much for the rest of us.

    "title": "The hope, joy and sorrow of Palm Sunday is a gift to all of us",
    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. April 13 is Palm Sunday, a holy day kept by many Christians around the world. This day commemorates the triumphal entry of Jesus Christ intoJerusalemsome 2,000 years ago. For Jesus, it was the beginning of a dramatic week that would see him crucified and later raised from the dead. This day,Palm Sunday, marks the beginning of Holy Week. For those Christians who keep Holy Week, we recall the dramatic events as told in the Gospels: the suffering, death, and resurrection of Jesus. In the Gospels, we read that Jesus entered Jerusalem in a procession that must have resembled both a parade and a protest. People lined the way throwing garments and palm branches as Jesus entered the holy city. They shouted \"Hosanna!\" This means, \"Save us!\" EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT PALM SUNDAY: WHAT DO THE PALMS REPRESENT? Ancient Jerusalem then was under Roman occupation, led by a puppet government. People wanted freedom and hope. They wanted what all people want: the ability to flourish as the people God has made us to be. But the military occupation needed people to be loyal first to the government over all else. When people began to call Jesus their king and their Lord, it was a threat to the established order. The tension on the first Palm Sunday must have been palpable. Hope and fear, freedom and might, righteousness and sin all mixed together. Palm Sunday marks the beginning of Holy Week.(iStock) It’s not so different today. All around us, the world seems increasingly divided against itself. I think people across the political spectrum can agree on that. Chaos seems to increase. Violence reigns. Where is our peace? Like those people of long ago, we who follow Jesus might well want to shout with fervor, \"Hosanna! Save us!\" We might likeJesusto come in and clean up our mess. But I think Jesus expects us to clean up the mess we have made. We need to turn over a new leaf. This is the very definition of repentance. When we shout \"Hosanna!\" today we should not be thinking that Jesus will \"save us\" by fixing the mess we have made without expecting us to change. Quite the contrary. Fixing the world happens one life at a time, starting in our own hearts. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The events of Holy Week show us that God loves us more than we can imagine. Jesus was willing to die for us, to suffer, to open the gates of eternal life to all who believe in him. On the cross, he asked his Father to forgive his executioners. The whole story — from start to finish — is a story of sacrifice, generosity, forgiveness, mercy, and, above all, grace. If you go to a church this Sunday, you’ll likely experience a collision of two moods. Waving palms and singing vigorous hymns, you may feel hope and joy. Then hearing the story of Jesus’ suffering and death, you may feel sorrow. I love this contrast. Hope, joy, and sorrow come together so often in our world.Read the headlines. Talk to a neighbor. Look around. If we can make sense of this collision of hope and sorrow on Palm Sunday, we have a good start at making sense of it every day of our lives. You see, we humans mess up pretty regularly. We need a redeemer. We can’t get out of our mess on our own. And, yes, we also need to own up to our failings and be ready to amend our lives. This is exactly what Palm Sunday is about. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Jesus enters the chaos of our lives and our world. We beg for salvation. Jesus will always hear us, and he is ready to forgive us our sins. And he is ready to journey with us through life’s challenges. This won’t make the problems of the world go away by magic, but it can give us courage to be bearers of grace and mercy in this world.

In fact, the U.S. appears to be pulling further ahead each year. In 2024, 57% of global venture capital funding went to U.S. startups — the first time that share has exceeded 50% in over a decade, per Dealroom. This widening gap is part of a years-long trend that U.K. founders have taken note of, the FT reports, and it’s prompting many to consider relocating abroad. “Recognizing that most venture funding comes from the U.S., we set up as a Delaware corporation, the preferred and familiar structure for American investors,” said Mati Staniszewski, co-founder of the London-based AI company ElevenLabs, in an interview with the FT. Barney Hussey-Yeo, founder and CEO of the AI start-up Cleo, told the FT that he already spends four months a year in San Francisco and is seriously considering a permanent move. “You get to a certain size where there is no capital in the U.K. And the problem is getting worse,” he said. “Honestly, the U.K. is kinda f***d if it doesn’t address [the problem].” Topics Subscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.

The Trump administration announced Friday evening thatconsumer electronics such as laptops and smartphones would be exemptfrom the tariffs it unveiled earlier this month. (While Trumpdelayed many of those tariffsthis week, he left a 10% baseline tariff in place, and also levied an additional 125% tariff on Chinese goods.) Reports about the exemptionsnoted that tech products might still be affected by targeted tariffs to come, with semiconductors coming under particular scrutiny. Lutnick made that more explicit on Sunday morning duringan interviewwith the ABC show “This Week,” saying that Trump is making these products “exempt from the reciprocal tariffs” but including them in “the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two.” “All those products are going to come under semiconductors, and they’re going to have a special focus type of tariff to make sure that those products get reshored,” Lutnick said. “We need to have semiconductors, we need to have chips, and we need to have flat panels — we need to have these things made in America.” Pressed on whether tariffs will mean higher prices for American consumers, Lutnick said, “I don’t think so,” and again emphasized, “I think the idea is that we can manufacture in America.” (Others have describedLutnick’s visionin which “the army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones, that kind of thing is going to come to America,” asa fantasy.) Trump, meanwhile,postedon Truth Social that there was “no Tariff ‘exception’ announced on Friday,” because (as noted in much of the initial coverage, includingTechCrunch’s story) electronics made in China remain subject to a separate 20% tariff that Trump has tied to fentanyl. He also said these products “are just moving to a different Tariff ‘bucket.’” “The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it,” he wrote. “We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.” This post has been updated with Donald Trump’s commentary on Truth Social.

Indeed, tech evangelist and investor Chris Messina alluded to this whilewritingthat Dorsey “has a point,” because, “Automated IP fines/3-strike rules for AI infringement may become the substitute for putting poor people in jail for cannabis possession.” Others were less sympathetic to this argument, with Ed Newton-Rex (whose nonprofit Fairly Trained certifies AI training practices that respect creators’ rights)describing the Dorsey-Musk exchangeas “Tech execs declaring all-out war on creators who don’t want their life’s work pillaged for profit.” And the writer Lincoln Michelwrote that“none of Jack or Elon’s companies would exist without IP law,” adding, “They just hate artists.” Dorsey elaborated on his stance in subsequent replies,writingthat there are “much greater models to pay creators” while claiming “the current ones take way too much from them and only rent-seek.” He made a similar point when attorney (and former Robert F. Kennedy Jr. running mate) Nicole Shanahanpushed backwith an all caps “NO.” “IP law is the only thing separating human creations from AI creations,” Shanahan said. “If you want to reform it, let’s talk!” Dorseycountered, “creativity is what currently separates us, and the current system is limiting that, and putting the payments disbursement into the hands of gatekeepers who aren’t paying out fairly.” Musk’s reply is at least consistent with statements he’s made in the past, for exampletelling Jay Lenothat “patents are for the weak.” A decade ago, in a so-called “patent giveaway,”he pledgedthat Tesla would not enforce patents against other companies that used them “in good faith.” (The company subsequentlysued Australia’s Cap-XXover patents, but it said that was a response to a lawsuit Cap-XX filed against a Tesla subsidiary.) And Dorsey has shown an interest in open source approaches to social media, most notably initiating the project that eventually became Bluesky, though he seemed to become disillusioned andeventually left Bluesky’s board. (Bluesky CEO Jay Graber recently saidDorsey’s departure “freed up” the companyfrom seeming like a billionaire’s side project.) It’s also worth noting that the line between a random conversation on Twitter/X and actual government policy is thinner than it used to be, with Musk joining the Trump administration and pushing mass layoffs throughhis Department of Government Efficiency— named after a meme and largely staffed from the tech world.

    "title": "Jim Zemlin on taking a ‘portfolio approach’ to Linux Foundation projects",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us TheLinux Foundationhas become something of a misnomer through the years. It has extended far beyond its roots as the steward of the Linux kernel, emerging as a sprawling umbrella outfit for a thousand open source projects spanningcloud infrastructure,security,digital wallets,enterprise search,fintech,maps, and more. Last month, the OpenInfra Foundation — best known forOpenStack— became thelatest addition to itsstable, further cementing the Linux Foundation’s status as a “foundation of foundations.” The Linux Foundationemerged in 2007from the amalgamation of two Linux-focused not-for-profits: the Open Source Development Labs (OSDL) and the Free Standards Group (FSG). With founding members such as IBM, Intel, and Oracle, the Foundation’s raison d’être was challenging the “closed” platforms of that time — which basically meant doubling down on Linux in response to Windows’ domination. “Computing is entering a world dominated by two platforms: Linux and Windows,” the Linux Foundation’s executive director,Jim Zemlin(pictured above), saidat the time. “While being managed under one roof has given Windows some consistency, Linux offers freedom of choice, customization and flexibility without forcing customers into vendor lock-in.” Zemlin has led the charge at the Linux Foundation for some two decades, overseeing its transition through technological waves such asmobile,cloud, and — more recently —artificial intelligence. Its evolution from Linux-centricity to covering just about every technological nook is reflective of how technology itself doesn’t stand still — it evolves and, more importantly, it intersects. “Technology goes up and down — we’re not using iPods or floppy disks anymore,” Zemlin explained to TechCrunch in an interview duringKubeConin London last week. “What I realized early on was that if the Linux Foundation were to become an enduring body for collective software development, we needed to be able to bet on many different forms of technology.” This is what Zemlin refers to as a “portfolio approach,” similar to how a company diversifies so it’s not dependent on the success of a single product. Combining multiple critical projects under a single organization enables the Foundation to benefit from vertical-specific expertise in networking or automotive-grade Linux, for example, while tapping broader expertise in copyright, patents, data privacy, cybersecurity, marketing, and event organization. Being able to pool such resources across projects is more important than ever, as businesses contend with a growing array of regulations such as theEU AI ActandCyber Resilience Act. Rather than each individual project having to fight the good fight alone, they have the support of a corporate-like foundation backed bysome of the world’s biggest companies. “At the Linux Foundation, we have specialists who work in vertical industry efforts, but they’re not lawyers or copyright experts or patent experts. They’re also not experts in running large-scale events, or in developer training,” Zemlin said. “And so that’s why the collective investment is important. We can create technology in an agile way through technical leadership at the project level, but then across all the projects have a set of tools that create long-term sustainability for all of them collectively.” The coming together of the Linux Foundation and OpenInfra Foundation last month underscored this very point. OpenStack, for the uninitiated, is an open source, open standards-based cloud computing platform that emerged from a joint project between Rackspace and NASA in 2010. Ittransitioned to an eponymous foundationin 2012, beforerebrandingas the OpenInfra Foundation after outgrowing its initial focus on OpenStack. Zemlin had knownJonathan Bryce, OpenInfra Foundation CEO and one of the original OpenStack creators, for years. The two foundations had already collaborated on shared initiatives, such as theOpen Infrastructure Blueprintwhitepaper. “We realized that together we could deal with some of the challenges that we’re seeing now around regulatory compliance, cybersecurity risk, legal challenges around open source — because it [open source] has become so pervasive,” Zemlin said. For the Linux Foundation, the merger also brought an experienced technical lead into the fold, someone who had worked in industry and built a product used bysome of the world’s biggest organizations. “It is very hard to hire people to lead technical collaboration efforts, who have technical knowledge and understanding, who understand how to grow an ecosystem, who know how to run a business, and possess a level of humility that allows them to manage a super broad base of people without inserting their own ego in,” Zemlin said. “That ability to lead through influence — there’s not a lot of people who have that skill.” This portfolio approach extends beyond individual projects and foundations, and into a growing array of stand-alone regional entities. The most recent offshoot wasLF India, which launchedjust a few months ago, but the Linux Foundation introduced aJapanese entitysome years ago, while in 2022 itlaunched a European branchto support a growingregulatoryanddigital sovereignty agendaacross the bloc. TheLinux Foundation Europe, which houses ahandful of projectssuch asThe Open Wallet Foundation, allows European members to collaborate with one another in isolation, while also gaining reciprocal membership for the broader Linux Foundation global outfit. “There are times where, in the name of digital sovereignty, people want to collaborate with other EU organizations, or a government wants to sponsor or endow a particular effort, and you need to have only EU organizations participate in that,” Zemlin said. “This [Linux Foundation Europe] allows us to thread the needle on two things — they can work locally and have digital sovereignty, but they’re not throwing out the global participation that makes open source so good.” While AI is inarguably a major step-change both for the technology realm and society, it has also pushed the concept of “open source” into the mainstream arena in ways that traditional software hasn’t — with controversy in hot pursuit. Meta, for instance, has positioned its Llama brand of AI models as open source, even thoughthey decidedly are notby most estimations. This has also highlighted some of the challenges of creating adefinition of open source AIthat everyone is happy with, and we’re now seeing AI models with a spectrum of “openness” in terms of access to code, datasets, and commercial restrictions. The Linux Foundation, already home to theLF AI & Data Foundation, which houses some75 projects, last year published the Model Openness Framework (MOF),designed to bringa more nuanced approach to the definition of open source AI. The Open Source Initiative (OSI), stewards of the “open source definition,” used this framework in its own open source AI definition. “Most models lack the necessary components for full understanding, auditing, and reproducibility, and some model producers use restrictive licenses whilst claiming that their models are ‘open source,’” the MOF paper authorswrote at the time. And so the MOF serves a three-tiered classification system that rates models on their “completeness and openness,” with regards to code, data, model parameters, and documentation. It’s basically a handy way to establish how “open” a model really is by assessing which components are public, and under what licenses. Just because a model isn’t strictly “open source” by one definition doesn’t mean that it isn’t open enough to help develop safety tools that reduce hallucinations, for example — and Zemlin says it’s important to address these distinctions. “I talk to a lot of people in the AI community, and it’s a much broader set of technology practitioners [compared to traditional software engineering],” Zemlin said. “What they tell me is that they understand the importance of open source meaning ‘something’ and the importance of open source as a definition. Where they get frustrated is being a little too pedantic at every layer. What they want is predictability and transparency and understanding of what they’re actually getting and using.” Chinese AI darling DeepSeekhas also played a big part in the open source AI conversation, emerging with performant, efficient open source models thatupended howthe incumbent proprietary players such as OpenAIplan to release their own modelsin the future. But all this, according to Zemlin, is just another “moment” for open source. “I think it’s good that people recognize just how valuable open source is in developing any modern technology,” he said. “But open source has these moments — Linux was a moment for open source, where the open source community could produce a better operating system for cloud computing and enterprise computing and telecommunications than the biggest proprietary software company in the world. AI is having that moment right now, and DeepSeek is a big part of that.” A quick peek across the Linux Foundation’s array of projects reveals two broad categories: those it has acquired, as with the OpenInfra Foundation, and those it has created from within, as it has done with the likes of the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF). While acquiring an existing project or foundation might be easier, starting a new project from scratch is arguably more important, as it’s striving to fulfill a need that is at least partially unmet. And this is where Zemlin says there is an “art and science” to succeeding. “The science is that you have to create value for the developers in these communities that are creating the artifact, the open source code that everybody wants — that’s where all the value comes from,” Zemlin said. “The art is trying to figure out where there’s a new opportunity for open source to have a big impact on an industry.” This is why Zemlin refers to what the Linux Foundation is doing as something akin to a “reverse venture capitalist” approach. A VC looks for product-market fit, and entrepreneurs they want to work with — all in the name of making money. “Instead, we look for ‘project-market’ fit — is this technology going to have a big impact on a specific industry? Can we bring the right team of developers and leaders together to make it happen? Is that market big enough? Is the technology impactful?” Zemlin said. “But instead of making a ton of money like a VC, we give it all away.” But however its vast array of projects came to fruition, there’s no ignoring the elephant in the room: The Linux Foundation is no longer all about Linux, and it hasn’t been for a long time. So should we ever expect a rebrand into something a little more prosaic, but encompassing — like the Open Technology Foundation? Don’t hold your breath. “When I wear Linux Foundation swag into a coffee shop, somebody will often say, ‘I love Linux’ or ‘I used Linux in college,’” Zemlin said. “It’s a powerful household brand, and it’s pretty hard to move away from that. Linux itself is such a positive idea, it’s so emblematic of truly impactful and successful ‘open source.’” Topics Senior Reporter Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk would like to ‘delete all IP law’ Why an Amazon driver could be the one who saves your life OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever’s Safe Superintelligence reportedly valued at $32B Week in Review: Jeff Bezos’ secret EV startup Hacked documents reveal guide to serving Elon Musk on private jets OpenAI will soon phase out GPT-4 from ChatGPT Fintech founder charged with fraud after ‘AI’ shopping app found to be powered by humans in the Philippines © 2025 Yahoo.",

According to Bloomberg, back in 2023, Amazon piloted a several months-long pilot program calledProject Pulse, equipping delivery vans with defibrillators and training drivers in CPR. In cities like London, Amsterdam, and Bologna, more than 100 drivers participated, with several of them receiving alerts from citizen responder apps and arriving on site. (Rescue services were reportedly already treating the victims.) The company hasn’t moved forward, but it is “evaluating the feedback and exploring additional opportunities for future programs,” an Amazon spokesperson tells Bloomberg. It’d likely a public relations win for the company. It would also be a way to expand Amazon’s healthcare ambitions beyond One Medical, the primary care provider for which it shelled out $3.9 billion in early 2023. With rivals like Walgreens and Walmart retreating from primary care — Walmartshutteredits primary healthcare business in April of last year, closing 51 locations, and Walgreens is being taken private again by Sycamore Partners for just$10 billion— Amazon could be feeling increasingly confident it can do what the others couldn’t: reshape healthcare delivery and bring more than just packages to customers’ doorsteps.

McIlroy rolled in a three-footer to beat Justin Rose in a sudden-death play-off to finally win his first Masters title and complete the career Grand Slam in a hugely dramatic final round. Having missed a par putt to win in regulation, McIlroy's birdie on the first extra hole denied his Ryder Cup team-mate as he claimed the biggest prize of his life. McIlroy let out a huge roar before collapsing to the ground and weeping tears of joy at the end of an extraordinary day of sporting theatre. \"I would say it was 14 years in the making,\" an emotional McIlroy said, referencing the 2011 Masters when he threw away a four-shot lead in the final round. \"A lot of pent-up emotion came out on the 18th green. A moment like that makes all the years and all the close calls worth it.\" Holding back more tears before he was helped into the Green Jacket by last year's winner Scottie Scheffler, McIlroy added: \"I want to say hello to mum and dad back in Northern Ireland. I can't wait to see them next week and can't wait to celebrate with them.\" Having won the US Open, The Open and two US PGA Championships by the end of 2014, McIlroy completes the full set of major championships at the 11th attempt. He becomes the sixth man - and first European - to clinch the Slam, joining Americans Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods and South Africa's Gary Player. It was another gut-wrenching Masters defeat for Rose, who also lost to Sergio Garcia in a play-off in 2017, but the 44-year-old Englishman deserves immense credit for bouncing back from a 75 on Saturday to push McIlroy all the way. Six key moments that won McIlroy the Masters The Masters - McIlroy wins play-off to complete career Grand Slam - reaction This video can not be played Watch McIlroy claim his Masters green jacket McIlroy's win is both the most significant achievement of his 18-year professional career and the culmination of a journey that has forced him to rebound from a series of major championship heartaches. It is fitting, too, that it is the most thrilling win of his career given the highs and lows he experienced over the final 18 holes. For a while, McIlroy threatened to add another to his list of recent near-misses. Back-to-back 66s gave him a two-shot lead to take into Sunday's final round but a double bogey on the first wiped out his advantage. However, from there he had three birdies in seven holes as he went four clear with nine to play, but four dropped shots in as many holes from the 11th gave hope to the chasing pack. And while others faded, 36-hole leader Rose birdied six of his final eight holes to force a play-off and keep alive the 2013 US Open winner's dream of winning the Masters at the 20th attempt. This video can not be played 'The shot of a lifetime' - McIlroy makes birdie for Masters lead All week, McIlroy has spoken about his ability to bounce back from setbacks. Key to his approach this week has been seeking advice from renowned sports psychologist Bob Rotella and McIlroy needed to lean heavily on his guidance during a final round that pushed him to the limit. Leading Bryson DeChambeau by two, McIlroy opened with a double bogey but regrouped to birdie three and four. After four straight pars, he picked up two more shots at nine and 10. At that point, McIlroy held a commanding four-shot lead as he threatened to pull away from the pack. But after dumping his third shot at the par-five 13th in the creek, he stumbled to another double bogey - his fourth of the week - and let another shot slip on the 14th. He regrouped to produce a stunning approach to 15, and while he missed his eagle putt, he followed a birdie with another gain on the 17th following a towering second shot from 196 yards to three feet. That took him to 12 under, one clear of Rose, who birdied the last, and needing a par on the 18th to win. There was another twist, however, as he pushed his approach into a greenside bunker and failed to sink his six-footer for par after splashing out of the sand, setting up a play-off with Rose. But McIlroy shook off that one last wobble to beat Rose and set the stage for remarkable scenes on the 18th green as he soaked in the acclaim and let his emotions flow. \"When I hit the wedge shot into the creek on 13 I felt I did a good job of bouncing back,\" added McIlroy. \"I was really nervous going out. It was almost as if the double bogey [at the first] calmed my nerves a little bit and got me into it. \"All week I responded to setbacks and that's what I'll remember. I'm so proud of that and being able to bounce back.\" Rose carded 10 birdies to force a play-off with McIlroy Sunday's round promised a thrilling sequel to McIlroy's duel with DeChambeau at last year's US Open. The American, who snatched a dramatic triumph at Pinehurst, was second after three rounds and looked poised to wreck the world number two's hopes again. But after a promising start which saw him take the lead with a birdie on the second hole, DeChambeau slipped to a three-over-par 75 as Rose - who started the day seven back - emerged as McIlroy's biggest challenger. Thirty-six hole leader Rose, who slipped down the leaderboard on Saturday with a 75, began with two birdies in his first three. While bogeys at four and five stalled his momentum, he picked up five shots in a seven-hole span to thrust himself into the mix. While former world number one Rose dropped further shots at 14 and 17, he birdied 15, 16 and drained a 20-footer on the last to pile the pressure on McIlroy before missing his birdie effort in the play-off. Having also finished runner-up at last year's Open Championship, it is another heartbreaking loss for Rose, but he played a central role in a Masters final round for the ages. \"He kind of gave me an opportunity on 18 from the fairway,\" said Rose of McIlroy's miscued approach to the last. \"That was nice of him. But then he closed the door beautifully on 18 with two great swings when it mattered most for him. \"What he's really learned to do this year is play much more controlled golf, and obviously it's paying off for him. He's having an unbelievable season.\" Sweden's Ludvig Aberg, who finished runner-up on his debut to Scheffler in 2024, briefly shared the lead with McIlroy and Rose but dropped four shots in his last two holes to finish seventh. Patrick Reed, champion in 2018, carded a closing 69, which was matched by two-time winner Scheffler, who finished a shot further back on eight under. The year is just beginning for McIlroy. Next month, he will attempt to win a sixth major at the US PGA Championship at Quail Hollow, a course where he was won four times. After that, McIlroy will seek to avenge his US Open heartache in 2023 and 2024 at Oakmont Country Club in June before rounding out the major season in July on home soil when the Open Championship returns to Royal Portrush, where he missed the cut in 2019. In September, McIlroy will also hope to help Europe retain the Ryder Cup against the United States at Bethpage Black in New York.

    "article_text": "Military planners have been called in to help tackle mounting piles of rubbish in Birmingham following a month-long strike by refuse workers. Thousands of tonnes of uncollected rubbish line the city's streets due to the all-out strike by Unite union members that began on 11 March. The city council hasdeclared a major incidentand asked neighbouring authorities to help tackle the crisis. Now, after a government appeal to the Army, a small number of office-based planners will provide logistical support for a short time. Soldiers are not being deployed to collect rubbish. Striking workers will vote on a \"partial deal\" to end the strike on Monday, Unite has said. A government spokesperson said: \"The government has already provided a number of staff to support the council with logistics and make sure the response on the ground is swift to address the associated public health risks. \"In light of the ongoing public health risk, a small number of office-based military personnel with operational planning expertise have been made available to Birmingham City Council to further support in this area.\" The spokesperson added this built on a range of measures on which it had supported the council, including opening household waste centres. Last week, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner urged striking bin workersto accept a new dealto end the dispute. She said a \"significantly improved\" offer had been made and the council had \"moved significantly to meet the demands of the workers so we can see an end to this dispute\". However, Unite General Secretary Sharon Graham said the deal represented \"a partial deal on pay protection for a few\" and the striking bin workers were \"in the driving seat around what they wish to accept\". At the end of March, the Labour-run city council declared a major incident, citing an estimated 17,000 tonnes of rubbish across Birmingham over the first four weeks of the strike.

    "title": "Some police forces unprepared for summer riots, MPs find",
    "article_text": "Police forces were in several cases unprepared for the level of violence that broke out in riots after the murder of three children in Southport last summer, a report by MPs has found. It left officers exposed to \"significant risk\", the Home Affairs Committee said, in disorder that saw attacks on hotels housing asylum seekers and mosques. However, the report said the policing response was \"entirely appropriate\" given the violence and criminality - with no evidence to suggest \"two-tier policing\". The police lead for the national response said the report \"rightly praises the efforts\" of officers and staff, adding the recommendations will be considered. Disorder broke out across the country following the fatal stabbing of Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, at a Taylor Swift-themed dance and yoga event in Southport in July 2024. Eight further children and two adults were also injured in the attack. Monday's report identified 246 events which took place in its aftermath - 88 of which were deemed significant - some turning violent. As of January 22 this year, 1,804 arrests had been made and 1,072 charges issued, the report said. Acknowledging this was the worst disorder the country had seen since 2011, MPs said police forces should have \"better anticipated the risk of disorder in general\" following an initial instance of disorder in Southport. Officers across the country worked \"tirelessly\", the report said, but forces being unable to act proactively left them exposed. The \"bravery and professionalism\" of the officers was commended after 302 were injured and between 54 and 69 taken to hospital. Staffordshire Police Chief Constable Chris Noble told the committee: \"This will change some officers for the rest of their lives and they will live with the impacts of it for the rest of their lives.\" The report found no evidence to support claims of \"two-tier policing\", finding instead that such commentary \"undermin[ed]\" the efforts of the officers. \"Those participating in disorder were not policed more strongly because of their supposed political views but because they were throwing missiles, assaulting police officers and committing arson,\" it said. Later on the day of the Southport attack, police said they had arrested an 17-year-old male. He was named as Axel Muganwa Rudakubana three days later, when restrictions preventing him from being identified due to his age were lifted. Misinformation regarding the identity of the suspect spread quickly online following the attack. Forces and the Home Office said it was a \"significant factor\" in the spread of disorder. The reports outlines the \"difficult position\" Merseyside Police faced around publishing details around the suspect but added the lack of information created a \"vacuum\". A recommendation has been made for the Crown Prosecution Service to publish its new media protocol \"as soon as possible\" and keep it regularly updated after MPs found existing guidance was \"not fit for the social media age\". The Law Commission is currently reviewing contempt of court law. Chief Constable BJ Harrington, who led the national response, said: \"We are pleased that the report robustly disagrees with the notion of 'two tier policing'. \"We are also appreciative of the consideration given to the dangerous of mis- and disinformation on social media, which remain substantial areas of risk for policing...\" Committee chair, Dame Karen Bradley, said \"lessons must be learned\" from the way the criminal justice system worked as a whole. \"It will need to ensure that police forces can improve how they deal with regular policing work as well as supporting them to develop capacity to respond to crises.\" A government spokesperson said they were \"working closely\" with police to both improve national decision-making and support for officers. A spokesperson from the CPS said work to update the media protocol began before the disorder, adding they \"are working to publish an updated version later this year\". \"Alongside this, we support proposals for law reform which will make the application of contempt law clearer and simpler.\" A teenager filmed and encouraged his cousins as they hurled pint glasses at officers, a court hears.

    "title": "Royal Mail: The curious case of why a billionaire wants to buy what looks like a fading relic",
    "article_text": "From the end of April, the 500-year-old Royal Mail will be controlled by a Czech billionaire who co-owns a football club and is a major investor in a British supermarket - so, why would he want this ailing institution? Listen to the audio version of this on BBC Sounds \"A pair of scissors, one empty teapot and some hot water, please.\" The slightly baffled staff at Claridge's scrambled to comply with Daniel Kretinsky's breakfast order as he sanitised and moisturised his hands. The upscale hotel has been serving tea to the global elite for decades but Mr Kretinsky brought along his own packet of Chinese green tea, which he snipped open (hence the scissors) and poured into the empty pot. He was tall, perfectly groomed, steely-eyed but unfaultingly polite and thoughtful. If you told anyone in the dining room he was a billionaire, they would have no problem believing it. Known as the Czech Sphinx for his enigmatic style, Mr Kretinsky, who is 49, is worth £6bn according to the Sunday Times Rich List. He lives in plush mansions in Paris and London, was originally a lawyer and made his fortune in European energy markets. Our meeting was at Claridge's in June 2024 - I was trying to convince him to give me an interview about his audacious attempt to buy a British institution that was once seen as a national treasure: Royal Mail. His profile as a buyer was one that that unions and ministers typically would be wary of because of his historic connections with Russia - his companies own a gas pipeline that has transported Russian gas to Europe. But six months on,his bid to buy Royal Mail'sparent company was cleared by the UK government after he agreed \"legally binding\" undertakings. It was agreed that the government would retain a so-called \"golden share\", requiring it to approve any major changes to Royal Mail's ownership, headquarters location and tax residency. The deal was also blessed by unions. Earlier this month, the owner of Royal Mail said that the takeover could be completed by the end of April as the deal cleared the final regulatory hurdles standing in the way. But step back and Royal Mail seems a strange target for a globally mobile oil and gas billionaire investor to set his sights on. It begs the question why would anyone, let alone a successful international entrepreneur, want to buy this faded relic? Royal Mail was founded by Henry VIII more than 500 years ago and still carries the royal cipher on its vans. It is part of the fabric of British life and many people still have a fond relationship with their 'postie', who walks down their path bringing their letters and parcels to their door. But in recent years Royal Mail's crown has slipped. It is losing money and market share, has been fined for missing delivery targets and has made an enemy of its own workforce through a series of bitter strikes. Royal Mail's letter business is in steep decline too. It has gone from a peak of 20 billion letters sent in 2004 to under seven billion sent last year. In December 2024,it was fined £10.5mby the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail. While the boom in e-commerce has seen the volume of parcels rise, Royal Mail's share of that more profitable business has been falling as new competitors like DPD, DHL, Amazon and Evri have eaten into its market share. Royal Mail was split off from the Post Office in 2012 and privatised in 2013 at a value of £3.3bn. Its shares immediately rocketed by 38% on the first day of trading, leading to criticism - from the National Audit Office, among others - that it had been sold on the cheap. At its peak in Covid-era May 2021, the company was worth more than £6bn but had slumped to just over £2bn when Mr Kretinsky launched his takeover bid last April. He sealed the deal at £3.6bn- 63% higher than before he signalled his intent, but barely more than it was worth at privatisation over a decade ago. \"Royal Mail is a business that has historically found it difficult to grow revenues by more than costs,\" says Alex Paterson, an analyst at Peel Hunt stockbrokers. \"It has seen its parcels market share eroded by more dynamic competition that has been able to invest more in technology, and it has struggled with industrial relations to keep staff working towards a common goal. \"This is not a challenge to underestimate nor one that can be overcome quickly, but that requires considerable long-term investment in infrastructure, technology and staff.\" Part of the challenge, and one that puts Royal Mail at a disadvantage compared with its rivals, is that unlike them, Royal Mail has to meet a string of legal and regulatory obligations, says Hazel King, the editor of Parcel and Post Technology International. Under what is called the universal service obligation (USO), Royal Mail is required by law to deliver letters six days a week and parcels five days a week to every address in the UK. So it cannot pick and choose which business it wants to do. \"Royal Mail must meet their universal service obligation while trying to compete with private firms who often cherry-pick the most profitable business,\" says Ms King. Mr Kretinsky says he has a plan. His success in the energy sector allowed himto buy a 27.5% stakein Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS). And his company – EP Group – intends to build a pan-European conglomerate built on three pillars: energy, retail and logistics. He sees IDS as the cornerstone of the logistics pillar, with a plan to go toe-to-toe with the likes of Deutsche Post DHL, DPD and Amazon. The USO has been under review by Ofcom, with Royal Mail hoping that the regulator will reduce the requirement to deliver second-class letters from six days a week to every other weekday. That single move could save Royal Mail £300m a year – putting it back on a break-even footing. Mr Kretinsky told me during our interview that he would honour the USO \"as long as I am alive\", but he is unsurprisingly very much in favour of changing its terms. He said he hopes that \"rational minds prevail\" when reforming a service that is unsustainable in its current form. So far, the noises from Ofcom seem to be supportive. The regulator's chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\". Given letter numbers are falling, \"we have to think about what is economical\", she said, adding Ofcom would be publishing plans for the regulation of Royal Mail \"to make sure it is sustainable\". While Royal Mail generally welcomed the proposed changes to the Universal Service Obligation, Royal Mail pushed back against proposed new delivery time and business customer requirements. Royal Mail said last week that the level at which Ofcom is proposing to set the new delivery targets – 99.5% of First Class letters delivered within three days, and the same percentage of Second Class letters within five – is \"over specified and will add significant cost to the delivery of the Universal Service\". It also expressed concerns that proposals to add a new category of regulation to ensure timely delivery for business users like direct mail companies \"goes against the wider government drive to reduce unnecessary regulation\". But there are other factors that may have driven the sale. Some analysts have speculated that there is another jewel in the crown of IDS - and that Mr Kretinsky may really be after a different part of the business. Along with Royal Mail, IDS also owns a European parcels business called GLS which it acquired in 1999 – long before Royal Mail was split off from the Post Office and privatised. Last year GLS made a profit of £320m, compared to Royal Mail, which lost £348m as letter volumes continued to plunge and new competitors ate into its market share of the more profitable parcels business. \"GLS has been a profitable growth business, which has seen investment whereas Royal Mail has been a perpetual underperformer, as the board of parent company IDS has invested where it thinks it will see the best returns,\" says Mr Paterson. Mr Kretinsky rejects suggestions from some quarters that he wants to break up the group and has committed to keeping it together for at least five years. Even beyond that, he says the plan is to grow the company rather than shrink it, so a disposal of GLS would be \"nonsensical\". In fact, Mr Kretinsky says he hopes to bring the European parcel know-how at GLS to bear on Royal Mail's operations. What the unions are hoping, and Kretinsky is promising, is that Royal Mail will see greater investment and over time begin to look a bit more like GLS and its European counterparts such as Deutche Post DHL. Given all the challenges Royal Mail faces, there's an obvious question - why would a billionaire want to chance his arm on turning round something that others couldn't, while up against powerful competitors? Well, if you believe as Kretinsky does - and he is surely right - that getting parcels to people is a profitable and growing industry, then buying Royal Mail and GLS gives you a way to become a big European player in logistics quickly. Add to that a powerful and historic brand, a database with every single UK address and a frontline workforce that most of its customers are fond of and pleased to see when they walk down the path - then, despite the challenges, it begins to make sense. Mr Kretinsky is convinced future growth lies in out-of-home (OOH) delivery. The parcel lockers found in supermarket car parks and elsewhere, operated by the likes of Amazon, Evri and UPS, have grown quickly across Europe. Earlier this month it was reported that Sainsbury's would be the first supermarket to partner with Royal Mail and install parcel lockers at supermarkets. Some are already operating at several stores including ones in Clapham, Kidderminster and Chislehurst. Royal Mail has also trialled a new postbox that can take small parcels. Customers procure a barcode from an app, then at the postbox they scan the barcode and drop the parcel into a drawer - this is all powered by solar panels on the box. Emma Gilthorpe, Royal Mail chief executive, called it an \"historic change\" to give postboxes \"a new lease of life\". All of this boils down to the same thing: convenience. It means customers don't have to wait at home for a delivery - the sender or parcel business emails or texts a code to unlock the locker. For the business it's more efficient, allowing couriers to deliver lots of parcels to one place - meaning fewer miles on the road and less time. \"If they can grow the parcels business and claw back market share, there is every chance that they can add new jobs that could offset the reduction in jobs in the declining letters business,\" says Mr Paterson. \"There is a significant long-term opportunity to run Royal Mail more successfully with regulatory changes to the USO and greater investment in technology and out-of-home deliveries.\" But Royal Mail still has a lot of catching up to do with its competitors. It currently has 1,500 lockers in the UK and aims to grow this figure to at least 20,000 over time. By contrast, Amazon already has 5,000 lockers across the UK and InPost has 7,500 across the UK. That Mr Kretinsky has pulled off the takeover is no easy feat. Royal Mail is, after all, considered vital national infrastructure and as such the deal required review under national security laws. Then there is the fact that his companies own a gas pipeline that has transported Russian gas to Europe – paid for and approved by EU member states. The small amount that was transported was reduced to zero at the end of 2024 when Ukraine refused to renew permission for any gas to flow across its borders. Speaking in front of MPs in November, UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company two years ago. Getting the unions on board seemed even more of a challenge and the Communication Workers Union was wary of Mr Kretinsky. \"The CWU believes Royal Mail should be in public hands,\" Dave Ward, the CWU's general secretary, told the BBC in June. \"We know there are legitimate concerns about Royal Mail Group being owned by a foreign private equity investor.\" But during negotiations, union representatives secured a series of time-limited commitments from him, including guarantees that he will protect Royal Mail's pension surplus, that there will be no compulsory redundancies for two years, no sell-off or break-up of any operational part of the existing company and no outsourcing of grades represented by the CWU. Mr Kretinsky also agreed to restrictions on moving dividends out of Royal Mail Group and to respect agreements with and recognition of the CWU. He said he would keep the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years. Union bosses told me that a life under Mr Kretinsky \"couldn't be any worse than what we have had for the last 10 years\". So, as Mr Kretinsky looks certain to pull off the sale, what will customers notice? The frequency of second-class deliveries may be reduced after the Ofcom review. We will see new Royal Mail lockers appearing in our neighbourhoods. And the price of first-class mail may go up: second-class stamps are regulated by Ofcom, while first-class ones are not. The monarch's head will still be on those stamps, but there is a new king of our mail system. And his name is Daniel Kretinsky.

    "title": "Landmark antitrust trial could force Zuckerberg to sell Instagram",
    "article_text": "A trial in the landmark antitrust case against social media giant Meta kicks off in Washington on Monday. The US competition and consumer watchdog alleges that Meta, which already owned Facebook, bought Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 to eliminate competition, effectively giving itself a monopoly. The FTC reviewed and approved those acquisitions but committed to monitor the outcomes. If the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) wins the case it could force Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to sell off both Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta previously said it was sure it would win and experts have told the BBC it is likely to argue that Instagram users have had a better experience since it was taken over. \"The [FTC's] argument is the acquisition of Instagram was a way of neutralizing this rising competitive threat to Facebook,\" says Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a professor of antitrust at Vanderbilt Law School. Ms Allensworth says Mr Zuckerberg's own words, including those from his emails, may offer the most convincing evidence at trial. \"He said it's better to buy than to compete. It's hard to get more literal than that,\" Ms Allensworth says. Meta, on the other hand, is likely to argue that intent is not particularly relevant in an antitrust case. \"They're going to say the real question is: are consumers better off as a result of this merger?,\" she said. \"They'll put on a lot of evidence that Instagram became what it is today because it benefited from being owned by Facebook.\" Mr Zuckerberg and the company's former chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg are both expected to testify at the trial, which could run for several weeks. The case, FTC v Meta, was filed during US President Donald Trump's first administration but risks becoming politicized during his second term. Mr Zuckerberg has lobbied Trump in person to have the FTC drop the case,according to the Wall Street Journal. When asked by the BBC to confirm that report, Meta sidestepped the question but said in a statement: \"The FTC's lawsuits against Meta defies reality.\" \"More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the commission's action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final,\" a Meta spokesperson told the BBC. Relations between Mr Zuckerberg and Trump had beenfrostypartly because Trump was barred from Meta's social media platforms after the US Capitol riot in January 2021. Since then, the relationship has thawed somewhat. Metacontributed$1m (£764,400) to Trump's inaugural fund, and in JanuaryannouncedUltimate Fighting Championship Fighter (UFC) boss Dana White, a close Trump ally, would join its board of directors. The company alsoannouncedin January that it was doing away with independent fact-checkers. President Trump's move to fire two FTC commissioners in March also hangs over the case. As Democrats, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya were in the minority on the five-seat commission. Until Wednesday, just two seats of those seats were filled, both by Republicans. Another Republican wasconfirmedby the Senate on Thursday. Slaughter and Bedoya - who are suing the Trump administration to be reinstated - say the move to push them out was meant to intimidate. \"The president sent a very clear signal not only to us but to Chairman Ferguson and Commissioner [Melissa] Holyoak that if they do something he doesn't like, he could fire them too,\" Slaughter told the BBC in a recent interview. \"So if they don't want to do a favor for his political allies, they're on the chopping block as well,\" Slaughter said. Slaughter and Bedoya both expressed alarm at recent reports about Zuckerberg's lobbying efforts. \"My hope is that there is no political interference,\" Mr Bedoya told the BBC. The FTC did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC. Ferguson, who was appointed as FTC chair by Trump, recentlytoldThe Verge he would \"obey lawful orders\" when asked what he would do if the president directed him to drop a lawsuit like the one against Meta. Ferguson added that he would be very surprised if anything like that ever happened. The FTC is considered a key antitrust watchdog. In recent years, it has returned hundreds of millions of dollars to victims of fraud, in addition to passing laws that ban junk fees and subscription traps. But as the Meta trial begins, it's among the many independent regulatory agencies that the administration seems keen to rein in. Chair Ferguson is also recentlyquotedreaffirming his belief that independent regulatory bodies are \"not good for democracy.\" FTC v Meta begins as another major antitrust case - USA v Google - enters what's known as the remedies phase. The Department of Justice won the first phase of that case last summer when Judge Amit Mehta found that Google holds a monopoly in online search, with a market share of around 90%. Last month, the DOJreiterateda demand made during the Biden administration that a court break up Google's search monopoly. The FTC's case against Meta will be tougher to prove, says Laura Phillips-Sawyer, an associate professor of business law at the University of Georgia. \"I think they have a real uphill battle,\" Ms Phillips-Sawyer said of the FTC. \"They have a long road before any consideration of divestiture of Instagram or WhatsApp is considered.\" That's because compared to online search, there's more competition in the personal network services space that Meta operates in, Ms Phillips-Sawyer said. Meta in a statement said the evidence at trial \"will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others.\" Social media company considered letting Beijing control content for access to its lucrative market, BBC told. The actor, who played the Facebook boss, says he is making vulnerable people \"feel threatened\". Many have questioned Meta's motivations for ditching fact checkers - but could it be a positive change? The Facebook and Instagram owner says the official profiles were updated to reflect the new position holders. Top tech billionaires including some who were critics of Trump during his first term flock to his inaugural celebrations.",

    "title": "Israeli air strike destroys part of last fully functional hospital in Gaza City",
    "article_text": "An Israeli air strike has destroyed part of al Ahli Arab Hospital, the last fully functional hospital in Gaza City. Witnesses said the strike destroyed the intensive care and surgery departments of the hospital. Video posted online appeared to show huge flames and smoke rising after missiles hit a two-storey building. People, including some patients still in hospital beds, were filmed rushing away from the site. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it targeted the hospital because it contained a \"command and control centre used by Hamas\". No casualties were reported, according to Gaza's civil emergency service. However, one child, who previously suffered a head injury, died as a result of \"the rushed evacuation process\", according to a statement from the Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem, part of the Anglican Church, which runs the hospital. Surrounding buildings, including St Philip's church, were also damaged, the diocese said. It added that it was \"appalled\" at the bombing of the hospital \"on the morning of Palm Sunday and the beginning of Holy Week\". Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said al Ahli Arab Hospital's building was \"completely destroyed\", leading to the \"forced displacement of patients and hospital staff\". The IDF said it had taken steps \"to mitigate harm to civilians or to the hospital compound, including issuing advanced warnings in the area of the terror infrastructure, the use of precise munitions, and aerial surveillance\". A local journalist, who was working at the hospital, said the IDF had phoned a doctor who was operating in the emergency department and asked them to evacuate the hospital immediately. \"All patients and displaced people must go out to a safe distance,\" the officer reportedly said. \"You have only 20 minutes to leave.\" Footage on social media showed staff and patients leaving the building while it was still dark outside. Dozens of Palestinians, including women and children, were also seen fleeing from a courtyard inside the hospital where they had been seeking shelter. Khalil Bakr told BBC Arabic's Gaza Lifeline programme that he and his three injured daughters had fled the hospital with only a couple of minutes to spare before it was bombed. \"It was terrifying,\" he said. \"The whole situation was difficult because I have already been injured. And as for my three daughters, one had her leg amputated, the other had her hand amputated, and the third had her body full of platinum plates.\" He added: \"Only two minutes separated us from death.\" Al Ahli Arab - a small medical facility before the war - was the only fully functional hospital in Gaza City, following the destruction ofAl-Shifa medical complexand other hospitals in the northern part of the Strip. World Health Organization director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the hospital was out of service following the evacuation order and attack, according to an update he received from the hospital's director. Dr Ghebreyesus highlighted how a child had died after a disruption to care, and said the hospital had been forced to move 50 patients to other hospitals, but was unable to move 40 critical patients and could not receive new patients until repairs are carried out. \"Hospitals are protected under international humanitarian law. Attacks on health care must stop,\" he stated. In its statement, the Hamas-run government media office condemned the attack. Israel was \"committing a horrific crime by targeting al Ahli Arab, which houses hundreds of patients and medical staff\", it said. UK Foreign Minister David Lammy said such \"deplorable attacks must end\", adding: \"Israel's attacks on medical facilities have comprehensively degraded access to healthcare in Gaza.\" The Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell said in a statement: \"For the only Christian hospital in Gaza to be attacked on Palm Sunday is especially appalling. \"I share in the grief of our Palestinian brothers and sisters in the Diocese of Jerusalem. I pray for the staff and patients of the hospital, and for the family of the boy who tragically died during the evacuation.\" In October 2023, an explosion at the same hospitalkilled hundreds of people. Palestinian officials blamed an Israeli strike for the blast. Israel said the blast was caused by a failed rocket launch by the armed group Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which denied responsibility. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 Israelis were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 50,933 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Of those, 1,563 have been killed since 18 March, when Israel restarted its offensive in the Gaza Strip, the ministry said. Israel's defence minister also said it had taken over a \"security zone\", which separates the southern cities of Rafah and Khan Younis. Mahmoud Khalil was arrested in March for his role in pro-Palestinian protests at  Columbia University. \"No state... can be exempt from the obligation not to commit war crimes, not to commit genocide, not to commit ethnic cleansing,\" Mirjana Spoljaric tells the BBC. Mahnoud Khalil's lawyer has accused the government of silencing speech it did not agree with. The mother of a Palestinian killed in an IDF attack on emergency vehicles tells the BBC of her loss.",

    "article_text": "The number of migrants arriving in the UK after crossing the English Channel has reached a new record for the first four months of the year. Some 656 people arrived in 11 small boats on Saturday, taking the total number of people crossing in 2025 so far to 8,064, according to provisional Home Office figures, Less than half-way through April, this is already higher than the 7,567 people who crossed the Channel over the first four months of last year - a record high at the time. A Home Office spokesperson said the government has a \"serious credible plan to finally restore order to our asylum system\", and it will \"stop at nothing\" to dismantle the business models of people-smuggling gangs. There were 5,946 arrivals in the first in the first four months of 2023, and then 6,691 in the same period in 2022. The 656 people who entered the UK on Saturday is the highest number of crossings recorded in a single day this year. However, the highest number of daily crossings recorded was on 3 September 2022, when 1,305 people were documented to have crossed into the UK via small boats. In a statement, the French Coastguard said it had rescued 50 people from various boats at sea on Saturday, after some migrants asked for help. Twenty-eight passengers were taken to Calais, in northern France, from one boat that got into difficulty, and 19 people were rescued on another boat while the rest onboard continued their journey. Three people from another boat were taken to the quayside in Boulogne-sur-Mer, while others on board refused assistance and continued on their way, it added. Earlier this yearthe government announced a series of measures to tackle people smuggling, includingnew criminal offence of endangering the lives of others at seawith a jail term of up to five years, expected to come into effect this year. A Home Office spokesperson said: \"We all want to end dangerous small boat crossings, which threaten lives and undermine our border security.\" They said the government's plan includes \"tougher enforcement powers, ramping up returns to their highest levels for more than half a decade and a major crackdown on illegal working to end the false promise of jobs used by gangs to sell spaces on boats\". Shadow home secretary Chris Philp described the figures as a \"national disgrace.\" \"This news underlines what we all knew - Keir Starmer has lost control of our borders,\" he said, adding: \"The gangs are laughing, the boats keep coming, and taxpayers are left to foot the bill\". In response, a Labour spokesperson said 8,325 people crossed the Channel in a 10-week period from July to September 2021, during Philp's time as immigration minister, \"and we didn't hear him calling those figures a national disgrace\". HGVs will queue on one side of the M20 while other traffic flows in both directions on the other. It is the earliest point in the year that crossings have reached 5,000 since recent records began. French officials say they rescued 14 others from the overcrowded boat which left Dunkirk on Wednesday. Helen Jenkins is to swim the English Channel in July to raise money for the RAF Benevolent Fund. Lisa Russell says they have \"no idea\" a man and a teenager were hiding on the bike rack.",

    "title": "Upstairs Downstairs actress Jean Marsh dies age 90",
    "article_text": "Upstairs Downstairs co-creator and actress Jean Marsh has died aged 90, her agent has confirmed. The British screen and stage star won an Emmy for her portrayal of hard-bitten but ultimately kind-hearted maid Rose Buck in the 1970s TV drama about the class system in Edwardian England. Marsh also had roles in Hollywood films including Cleopatra, Willow and Alfred Hitchcock's Frenzy and on TV in Doctor Who. In a statement, Marsh's friend the film director Sir Michael Lindsay-Hogg paid tribute to her as \"wise and funny... very pretty and kind, and talented both as an actress and writer\", adding she died \"peacefully in bed looked after by one of her very loving carers\". In his statement, Sir Michael described almost daily phone conversations with Marsh over the past 40 years. She was, he said, an \"instinctively empathetic person who was loved by everyone who met her\". Marsh came up with the idea of a period drama involving the servants of a wealthy family while house sitting in France with her friend, the actress Dame Eileen Atkins, she later told the New York Times. The pair went on to create the series, which told the story of the Bellamy family and their servant staff who lived underneath them, alongside John Hawkesworth and John Whitney. The ITV show was a critical and popular success and also found a fond audience in the United States, where it aired on PBS. Upstairs Downstairs is said to have partly inspired the Downton Abbey series and was later revived and reimagined by the BBC in 2010. Marsh became the only original cast member to return, portraying the same role in five episodes. Asked by the Daily Telegraph in 2010 why viewers appeared to be so interested in master-and-servant dramas, Marsh said: \"We still seem to want it because if you rose out of your class, you knew you had done well. And we like it because the past is not as worrying as the news.\" She teamed up again with Dame Eileen Atkins in 1991 to co-create the BBC costume drama The House of Elliott.

    "title": "The Last of Us is back, and it's The Apprentice final: What's coming up this week",
    "article_text": "This week,The Last of Usreturns to our screens - two years after the drama won over critics and fans alike. But that's not all the week has in store. It’sThe Apprentice finalon BBC One, Alex Garland's new filmWarfareis out, and gaming fans haveIndiana Jones and the Great Circleto look forward to. Read on for what's coming up this week... The first season ofThe Last of Uswas haunting, terrifying, and moving in equal measure. So there’s a lot to live up to when season two kicks off on Monday. The TV adaptation of the hit video game stars Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal as lead characters Ellie and Joel. Having dodged zombies and ruthless militia in an arduous journey across America in season one, they are now living in Jackson, Wyoming - but danger is never far away. I've had a sneak preview, and can tell you that the first episode alone is fraught with tension. And the reviews, so far, have been glowing. Empiregives it five stars, calling it “television at its peak”, while The Telegraph - whichalso gives it five stars- says it is “superb”. A pizza company boss and the owner of an air conditioning firm walk into a boardroom... Not the start of a bad joke, but something you can actually expect to see in the final of BBC One's The Apprentice, which takes place on Thursday at 9pm. There were 18 candidates at the start of season 19. Now, after weeks of tasks, firings and cringe-inducing moments, there are just two. Anisa Khan and Dean Franklin have one last chance to impress business tycoon Lord Sugar, and to win the £250,000 investment. Anisa said winning wouldn’t just be for her, but also “a win for people who feel like I represent them as well”. Meanwhile, Dean said he wanted to make his kids proud: “For them to go into school the next morning and say, \"My dad's won The Apprentice.\" By Helen Bushby, entertainment reporter It's an intense, immersive experience watching Alex Garland and Ray Mendoza’s latest filmWarfare, which plunges you almost immediately into the thick of a US military surveillance mission which goes wrong, in Iraq in 2006. The film's ensemble cast includes Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3's Will Poulter and Heartstopper's Kit Connor.They told the BBC they bondedat a tough military bootcamp, where they learned military jargon, gun safety and were pushed beyond their limits. The cast also shaved each other's heads before filming and got shared tattoos afterwards, speaking about how they wanted to mark what had been a \"formative\" experience, building lasting friendships. Based on the memories of soldiers on the surveillance mission in Ramadi, an area controlled by Al Qaeda, the cast also includes Reservation Dogs' D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, Shōgun's Cosmo Jarvis, Stranger Things and the forthcoming Beatles biopic's Joseph Quinn, and Riverdale's Charles Melton. Warfare is out in cinemas on Friday. By Tom Richardson, Newsbeat reporter Gaming. Waiting. Two things that often go hand in hand when it comes to new releases (GTA 6, anyone?). But one wait comes to an end this week with the release ofIndiana Jones and the Great Circleon PlayStation 5. First released on Xbox and PC last December, it was one of 2024's best-reviewed games. It was praised for its compelling stealth gameplay, puzzling and immersive environments, as well as an uncanny performance from celebrated video game actor Troy Baker in the main role. His portrayal of the world's luckiest archaeologist even got the seal of approval from original Indy Harrison Ford. PlayStation fans had to hold out because The Great Circle's Swedish developer MachineGames is part of ZeniMax, one of the many gaming companies bought up by Microsoft. The formerly bitter rival has softened its stance on exclusivity of late – a move which has upset some Xbox fans but pleased PS5 owners. Also out this week isLost Records: Bloom & Rage Tape 2, the concluding part of the Yellowjackets-meets-Stranger-Things narrative adventure from the original makers of the Life is Strange series.  There's no platform-exclusive shenanigans with this one – it lands on PS5, Xbox and PC from Tuesday. The actress shows a softer side to Neil Young, and discusses his fears of being barred from the US. The British star won an Emmy for her role in the Edwardian period TV drama she co-created in the 1970s. A new cinema solely dedicated to screening LGBTQ+ films opens in south London. A planned UK version of the legendary US comedy show is described as a \"difficult proposition\". The actor speaks about growing up in the spotlight and embracing her autism diagnosis.",

    "title": "'People think he's intimidating but he's guileless': Daryl Hannah on her Neil Young film",
    "article_text": "Fifty-seven years into his career, Neil Young has harvested millions of fans – but none of those followers is more devoted than his pet dogs. \"They love the music,\" says the musician's wife, actress Daryl Hannah. \"They go to every sound check and lay under the piano on the stage. Whenever Neil is playing, the dogs just migrate right to him andlay at his feet.\" It's not just the dogs. During the 2020 lockdown, Young performed a livestream concert from the barn at his Colorado farm, surrounded by alpacas, ducks, chickens and even a horse. \"And every single one of the animals came over and laid down and watched him,\" Hannah says. \"It was so cool. I think they're really drawn to the music.\" Hannah, known for appearing in films like Blade Runner, Splash and Kill Bill, directed that livestream – and she's stayed behind the camera to make a documentary about Young's 2023 solo tour. Filmed largely on her phone (\"and it's not even the most recent model\"), it captures the star's return to the stage, aged 75, after a four-year break, with his dogs in tow. \"He was very nervous about it,\" she recalls. \"There's always a point where he's like, 'I don't know if I can do this… We'll see'.\" \"It's funny, because he didn't do any rehearsals before the tour. He likes things to be real and spontaneous. But as soon as he walked out on stage, he was fine.\" Playing without a band, the shows were loose and unpredictable. The setlist changed every night, and even recurring songs like Heart of Gold and Like A Hurricane would be played in different settings, on different instruments, without warning. It's a set-up that caused his director a few headaches. \"It was really hit or miss because every day he would go out to do sound check, and he would choose one of his three pianos and play something like Expecting To Fly,\" says Hannah. \"So we'd set a camera on that piano but, when it came to show time, he wouldn't go near it. There were quite a few shows where we literally got no footage. \"I was frustrated in the editing room, trust me.\" Despite those challenges, Hannah captured spellbinding, stripped back versions of rarely-played tracks like Vampire Blues, If You Got Love and Prime Of Life. More revealing, however, was the footage she shot off the stage. Large stretches of the film take place on a silver eagle tour bus, where Young rides shotgun beside his longtime driver, Jerry Don Burden. Together, they shoot the breeze like Vladimir and Estragon - but rather than waiting for Godot, they're waiting for the next arena car park. The conversations are wonderfully mundane. There is ample discussion of scenery, snacks and setlists (\"people think they want to hear the hits, because that's all they've ever heard\", Young observes.) It's punctuated by stretches of companionable silence, where Young drums on his knees, or interacts with his son Ben, who was born with severe cerebral palsy. Later, the musician emerges from the bathroom, stares into the camera and deadpans: \"Now there's no risk of having to pee in the middle of the show\". Capturing that day-to-day normality was Hannah's motivation from the start. \"So many performers put on a persona, and Neil just does not have that quality at all. Whatever he's talking about with his bus driver, he continues talking about with the audience. \"People think of him as this intimidating, inscrutable person who'll make an album the record company refuses to put out,\" she continues, referring to the time Geffen Records sued Young for submitting two albums it considered \"musically uncharacteristic\". Hannah says people who judge him on that basis have got it wrong. \"He just has an absolute, uncanny commitment to his creative muse,\" she argues. \"He's not driven by financial interests, he's not driven by self-aggrandisement, he's not driven by anything other than that creative force, and it's pretty incredible to witness. \"Having spent so much time with him, my perception is that he's completely guileless. He has a lot of warmth and innocence, so I wanted to show that.\" Young recently made headlines forpulling out of the Glastonbury Festival, saying the BBC had asked him \"to do a lot of things\" he was \"not interested in\". He later backtracked,saying he'd received bad information, and will top the bill on the Pyramid Stage this June (Hannah jokes he'll serenade Glastonbury's livestock, in the style of his lockdown sessions). But his European tour isn't without peril.Writing on his website, Young has shared concerns that he could be barred from the US upon his return, following a rise in the number of people being detained and deported upon entering the country. \"If I talk about Donald J Trump, I may be one of those returning to America who is barred or put in jail to sleep on a cement floor with an aluminium blanket,\" he wrote. Young, who holds dual Canadian-American citizenship, has long been an outspoken critic of President Trump, calling him \"a disgrace to my country\" andsuing himfor using the song Rockin' In the Free World on the campaign trail. Hannah reveals her husband was harassed during the first Trump administration, as he went through the process of becoming a US citizen. \"They tried to every trick in the book to mess him up, and made him keep coming back to be re-interviewed and re-interviewed. It's ridiculous [because] he's been living in America and paying taxes here since he was in his 20s.\" Despite that, she doesn't think Young will be prevented from entering the country. \"They've been detaining people who have green cards or visas – which is hideous and horrifying -  but they have not, so far, been refusing to let American citizens back in the country, so I don't think that's going to happen.\" Hannah will accompany Young to Glastonbury, and says she'll film his performance from the side of the stage (perhaps the BBC can use that footage, if all else fails). The trip happens to fall on the 25th anniversary of her West End debut, in The Seven Year Itch. So, has she any desire to tread the boards again? \"Oh God, no,\" she exclaims. \"I really loving directing, because I don't have to be the focus of things, and that's a much more comfortable position for me. \"I mean, never say never, but that's how I feel right now.\" Neil Young: Coastal will be shown in cinemas on 17 April. Dom Whiting, known as the DJ On The Bike, said the event in Oxford would be \"somewhat of a refresh\". Warfare is also coming out, while new game Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is released. Headliners at the California music festival this year include Megan Thee Stallion, Post Malone and Green Day.

    "title": "In Canada's car capital, auto workers brace for the worst",
    "article_text": "A Lawton has worked in Canada's auto sector for more than a century. Their children are \"fifth generation Ford workers\", Kathryn Lawton said, and she and her husband  both work for the carmaker in Windsor, the heart of Canada's automobile sector, just a bridge away from the US state of Michigan. So when US President Donald Trumpsuggested that Canada stole the Americanauto industry, Chad Lawton calls it \"ludicrous\". \"These were never American jobs. These were Canadian jobs,\" he told the BBC, on the day that Trump's auto tariffs came into force. \"They've always been Canadian jobs, and they're going to stay Canadian jobs because we didn't take them from them. We created them, we sustained them.\" Kathryn agreed: \"This is Ford City right here.\" Tucked away in southwestern Ontario, Windsor and the surrounding Essex county now finds itself on one of the front lines of Trump's trade war as it faces a 25% tariff on foreign-made vehicles (though for Canada, that will be reduced by half for cars made with 50% US-made components or more) as well as blanket 25% US tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. US tariffs on auto parts are expected next month. The region of just over 422,000 grew alongside Detroit - nicknamed Motor City for its role as an auto manufacturing hub - turning the region into an important centre for North American automobile production. Ford first established its presence in Windsor in 1896, while the first Stellantis (then Chrysler) factory arrived in 1928, with dozens of factories and suppliers springing up around the city and surrounding region in the ensuing decades. Much of the manufacturing has since left the city, though it still boasts two Ford engine factories and a Stellantis assembly plant, which employ thousands. Workers on both sides of the border have built iconic vehicles over the decades, most recently models like the Dodge Charger and the Ford F-150. Some 24,000 people work directly in the automotive industry in Windsor-Essex, while an estimated 120,000 other jobs depend on the sector. A drive through the neighbourhood around the Ford factory feels like a trip back in time, showcasing classic bungalows from the last century. Many have seen better days, though each boasts a verandah and small front yard. Large murals celebrating the city's automotive history punctuate the scenery. Windsor has weathered the challenges of the North American auto sector alongside Michigan, as the industry shares a deeply integrated supply chain. Chad Lawton points to the 2008 financial crisis, when the Big Three American automakers - Ford, General Motors and Chrysler - faced staggering losses, and GM and Chrysler received billions in US bailouts to avoid bankruptcy. That period was \"bad, not just for next door, but also we went through a very, very rough time\", he said. \"This feels the same. The level of anxiety with the workers, the level of fear, the idea and the belief that this is just something that is so completely out of your control that you can't wrap your head around what to do.\" John D'Agnolo, president of Unifor Local 200, which represents Ford workers in Windsor, said the situation \"has created havoc\". \"I think we're going to see a recession,\" he said. He continued: \"People aren't going to buy anything. I gotta tell my members not to buy anything. They gotta pay rent and food for their kids.\" What makes the tariffs such a hard pill to swallow for auto workers the BBC spoke to is that this situation has been brought about by the US, Canada's closest economic and security ally. \"It seems like a stab in the back,\" said Austin Welzel, 27, an assembly line worker at Stellantis. \"It's almost like our neighbors, our friends - they don't want to work with us.\" Christina Grossi, who has worked at Ford for 25 years, said the prospect of losing her job, and what it will mean to her family, is \"terrifying\". But Ms Grossi also fears losing the meaning she gets from her work. \"You've been doing this job for so long and you really take pride in it, you're proud of what you're putting out to the public,\" she said. \"And now someone's taking away the opportunity to do that.\" Laura Dawson, the executive director of Future Borders Coalition, said the tariffs could cause major upheavals throughout the sector due to its deep integration, with ripple effects felt across the continent if exports from Canada stop for more than a week. She said the US tariffs structure is extremely complicated. Cars crossing the border will need every component to be assessed for \"qualifying content\" - where it originates, the cost of labour to produce it, and - if it contains steel or aluminium - where that metal came from. \"Every part of an automobile is literally under a microscope for where it was produced and how,\" she said. The US tariffs have been a major factor in Canada's general election, which is on 28 April, with Canada's political parties rolling out suites of plans on the campaign trail to help the auto sector. Liberal leader Mark Carney, the current prime minister, has pledged to create a C$2bn ($1.4bn; £1.1bn) fund to boost competitiveness and protect manufacturing jobs, alongside plans to build an \"all-in-Canada\" auto component parts network. In his role as prime minister, he imposed last week a reported C$35bn in counter auto tariffs, in addition to previously announced reciprocal measures on the US. Carney's main rival, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, has vowed to remove sales tax on Canadian vehicles, and to create a fund for companies affected by the tariffs to help keep their employees. Jagmeet Singh, whose left-wing New Democratic Party is fighting for a competitive seat in Windsor, has pledged to use every dollar from counter tariffs to help workers, and to stop manufacturers from moving equipment to the US. Still, Windsor's economy is dependent on automakers, and heavily relies on trade with the United States. If it falters, everything - from restaurants to charities - will feel the effects. The Penalty Box is a sports bar just down the road from the Stellantis plant, and popular with the workers there. \"We're one of the busiest restaurants. I don't want to say it, but if you ask around about the Penalty Box, they'll tell you,\" its 70-year-old owner, Van Niforos, said. \"We do close to 1,000 meals a day.\" With a white apron and a wide smile, he relates its 33-year history. But his demeanour darkens when asked about threats the auto sector faces. \"It's a devastating situation. I don't want to think about it,\" he said. \"We employ 60 people and we're open six days a week. [If something happens to the Stellantis plant], will we be able to keep 60 people working? Absolutely no.\" Chad Lawton, sitting in his office at the local union, takes a deep breath as he contemplates how precarious his life feels. He doesn't think Carney's counter tariffs help the current situation, arguing they \"just makes a really bad situation a little bit worse\". He hopes there is room for trade negotiation, but said he will be the first to say that Canada \"cannot just concede and roll over\". \"I've worked for a Ford Motor Company for almost 31 years, and I have never seen anything close to this,\" he said. \"That includes Covid, because at least with Covid, we knew what we were dealing with. And there was some certainty there.\" \"This is all over the map.\" Tariffs are a key part of the US president's political vision, but economists fear a global trade war. The former ambassador to the Netherlands previously backed Canada as \"a sovereign state\" despite annexation threats. 'Captain Canuck' makes a comeback as a symbol of Canadian 'independence' as Trump takes aim at the country. Canadians will vote on April 28. Here is a breakdown of who could be their next prime minister. Canada is holding a national election amid growing tension with the US over trade and tariffs.",

    "article_text": "Hundreds of homes and roads on Lanzarote have been flooded, after torrential rainfall swept across the Canary Island on Saturday. Lanzarote's government declared a state of emergency overnight after 6cm (2.4 inches) of rain poured down on the popular holiday destination in just two hours. No injuries have been reported by the Spanish authorities - and the state of emergency was lifted on Sunday morning. The head of Lanzarote's emergency services told local media some homes had been submerged, with floodwaters leaving behind a \"great quantity of mud\". \"We have been working all night, attending 300 calls overnight, many of them in Arrecife and Teguise,\" Enrique Espinosa said on Sunday. Emergency services attended more than 150 incidents in Costa Teguise and in excess of 70 in Arrecife, local media reports. The area of San Bartolomé was badly hit, according to Lanzarote's government. Dramatic footage circulating on social media shows a large surge of floodwater flowing rapidly under a bridge, leaving cars stranded on flooded roads. The Canaries are particularly vulnerable to floods when hit with intense rain, as their dry climate and volcanic rock mean the ground does not absorb large volumes of water well. The torrential rain came off the back of Storm Olivier, which swept over the Canaries, mainland Spain and Portugal in recent days - triggering several weather alerts. Spain's meteorological service has issued weather warnings for many areas of the country from Sunday to Tuesday - including storms in the north east, rain in the Balearic islands and wind in parts of both the north and south coast. The power couple both worked for Siemens, which said it was \"deeply saddened\" by their deaths. Six people have been confirmed to have died following the crash near to the New Jersey side of the Hudson. The Spanish government is moving to make renting more affordable and boost the supply of homes. Jason Taylor, 36, had been missing since Saturday when he was seen leaving Alicante airport on foot. Four others were injured in the blast at the mine in Asturias, northern Spain.",

    "title": "Investigation into prison officer attack by Manchester bomber continues",
    "article_text": "The investigation into an attack on three prison officers at a high-security prison on Saturday remains ongoing, counter-terrorism police have said. Three officers were taken to hospital with \"life-threatening injuries\" after being attacked by Hashem Abedi, one of the men responsible for the Manchester Arena bombing, according to the Prison Officers' Association (POA). The Prison Service confirmed that three officers were treated in hospital after the incident at HMP Frankland in County Durham - one of whom has since been discharged. Abedi, 28, was jailed for life with a minimum term of 55 years in 2020 for helping his brother carry out the 2017 suicide bombing. Counter-terrorism policing north east is currently leading the investigation with support from Durham Constabulary. On Sunday, the counter-terrorism unit confirmed two of the three officers remain in hospital \"with serious injuries\". \"Extensive enquiries continue to establish the full circumstances and explore any potential motivation,\" the statement said. \"We are keeping an open mind as we investigate to establish the facts.\" The POA said the officers sustained injuries including burns, scalds and stab wounds, as they outlined that Abedi threw hot cooking oil over them and used \"home made weapons\" to stab them. National chairman of the POA, Mark Fairhurst, said the condition of the two officers who remain in hospital has since \"stabilised\". The incident took place at a separation centre within the prison - designed to hold those considered the most dangerous and extremist offenders. Hashem Abedi was found guilty in 2020 of 22 counts of murder, attempted murder and conspiracy to cause an explosion likely to endanger life and sentenced to a minimum term of at least 55 years before he could be considered for parole. His brother, Salman Abedi, carried out the suicide attack at the Manchester Arena in 2017. Hashem Abedi was later convicted of a previous attack on two prison officers at Belmarsh Prison in south-east London along with two others. Fairhurst has called for the \"immediate\" restriction and removal of cooking facilities from separation centres as well as greater protections for frontline staff. \"We are worried about the knock-on effects and copycat incidents,\" he said on Sunday. The Ministry of Justice said there will be a full review into the incident. \"The government will do whatever it takes to keep our hardworking staff safe,\" the department said. A spokesperson for the Prison Service said violence in prisons \"will not be tolerated\", adding they will push for the \"strongest punishment\" for attacks on staff. NHS bosses say they need to focus on making improvements following the Nottingham attacks. A 38-year-old man was arrested as he flew in to Stanstead Airport. Simon Woodall and Josh Morris smuggled items such as phones, drugs and tobacco into prisons. Children at Wetherby Young Offender Institution are locked up \"for hours on end\", campaigners say. The 143-year-old Glasgow jail which is due to be replaced in 2028 is operating at 30% over capacity.",

    "article_text": "A man has died in a house explosion that wrecked multiple properties and led to dozens of evacuations. Homes in John Street, Worksop, Nottinghamshire, were evacuated andemergency services were called to the scenejust before 20:00 BST on Saturday. The terraced home where the explosion happened was destroyed and two neighbouring houses had partially collapsed, with eight other properties and 20 cars damaged by debris. On Sunday, police confirmed the body of a man, in his 50s, had been found in the wreckage while another person was taken to hospital with minor injuries and later discharged. Nottinghamshire Police said emergency services treated the man but were unable to save him and he died at the scene. The explosion was declared a major incident by emergency services on Saturday evening. Everyone else who may have been in the area at the time has been accounted for, police added. An investigation to establish the cause of the explosion continues, police said. A total of 35 properties in the area have been evacuated, with 48 residents needing alternative accommodation, said Julie Leigh, leader of Bassetlaw District Council. She said the council had provided alternative accommodation at the nearby Crown Place Community Centre, while others have been staying with family and friends. Ch Insp Clive Collings said: \"This is an extremely serious incident that has led to a man's untimely death. \"The man's family have been informed and are being supported by specially trained officers. \"I have no doubt that this incident will have come as a shock to the community in Worksop.\" Anyone with concerns is encouraged to contact the force or speak with an officer at the scene, he added. Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service (NFRS) said specialist urban search and rescue teams were called in to search the area after the blast. Later, demolition workers - including a cherry picker vehicle - attended the scene after midday on Sunday. Residents, who live near John Street, described\"chaos\" in the wake of the explosion. They said they had heard a loud crashing sound which immediately prompted a large number of people to rush out into the street. One resident told the BBC there was thick black smoke in the street as some people ran towards the wrecked house to try to help. Bryony Wilkinson, who lives in John Street and was in her house at the time of the explosion, said: \"It started off with a really loud bang and afterwards the whole house felt like it was shaking. \"It put me into shock and I froze for five seconds. I could hear a commotion outside and saw the black smoke outside.\" On Sunday afternoon, a police spokesperson at the scene told the BBC that firefighters had ended their search operation. Meanwhile, demolition company Elite Group Demolition said it was waiting for permission to remove a dangerous wall. A Cadent gas van also passed though the cordon. Purvi Srikenthan, who runs the Today's Local shop on nearby Sandy Lane, said she had been helping provide free food to families who were staying at the community centre. The 43-year-old said: \"We are here to help local people because we are part of the community. \"There's a lot of families and children affected so we thought we might be able to help them and provide food. \"I only just heard the news that a man has died which is really sad. I feel so sorry for that family and all of the people who are affected.\" Crews from fire stations in Warsop, Worksop, Mansfield and Clowne arrived at the scene soon after the explosion. Andy Wade, 59, says he lives 2.5 miles (4km) away but arrived at the scene because he knew the man who died. He said he \"kept himself to himself most of the time\". \"I just heard a bang and I thought that's loud,\" Mr Wade said. \"About 20 minutes later it all started appearing on Facebook and everyone got in touch with me to say there's been an explosion on John Street. \"When the photos started coming through I knew whose house it was. I don't know the circumstances but I'm obviously very upset.\" Follow BBC Nottingham onFacebook, onX, or onInstagram. Send your story ideas toeastmidsnews@bbc.co.ukor viaWhatsAppon 0808 100 2210.",

    "title": "Trump in excellent health, says White House doctor",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump is in \"excellent cognitive and physical health\", says his White House physician. In the first annual physical of his second presidential term at a Washington DC-area hospital, Trump was also found to have scarring \"on the right ear from a gunshot wound\", after an assassination attempt last July. \"President Trump remains in excellent health, exhibiting robust cardiac, pulmonary, neurological, and general physical function,\" his doctor, Captain Sean Barbabella, said in a memo. At 78, Trump was the oldest president to take office in January, though his predecessor, Joe Biden, was older at 82 by the time he left. As a part of Friday's nearly five-hour medical examination at the Walter Reed hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, Trump received several blood tests, a cardiac examination and ultrasounds, said his doctor, a US Navy emergency physician who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. \"President Trump exhibits excellent cognitive and physical health and is fully fit to execute the duties of the Commander-in-Chief and Head of State,\" Dr Barbabella wrote in the memo released by the White House on Sunday. The president received neurological tests on his mental status, nerves, motor and sensory function and reflexes and showed no signs of depression or anxiety, according to the memo. Trump was also given the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and scored 30 out of 30, said Dr Barbabella. The test is commonly used to detect cognitive decline and early signs of dementia and has tasks such as naming animals, drawing a clock and repeating words back five minutes later. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Saturday, Trump said he \"got every answer right\" on the cognitive test. \"Overall, I felt I was in very good shape,\" Trump said. \"A good heart, a good soul, a very good soul.\" He added that doctors had given him \"a little bit\" of advice on lifestyle changes to improve his health, though he did not provide details. Dr Barbabella also said Trump had \"minor sun damage\" and a few \"benign skin lesions\". The president takes several medications to control his cholesterol - Rosuvastatin and Ezetimibe - as well as Aspirin for cardiac prevention and Mometasone cream for a skin condition, said the memo. Trump's cardiac examination showed \"no abnormalities\", wrote Dr Barbabella. The examination noted the president's medical history of \"well-controlled hypercholesterolemia\", a condition which can increase a patient's risk of a heart attack. Other conditions noted in his medical history included a past Covid infection, rosacea, which is a skin condition often causing redness in the face, and a benign colon polyp. The president weighs 224lb (101kg) and stands 6ft 2.5in tall, according to the records from Dr Barbabella. Trump has shed some pounds since February 2019, when he weighed 243lb. Under the Body Mass Index calculator, he would currently be categorised within the overweight range, and not obese. The memo noted that the president's \"joints and muscles have a full range of motion\", while crediting his good health to an active lifestyle, including \"frequent victories in golf events\". It is the first medical report on Trump released to the public since a gunman tried to kill him at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last July, grazing his ear with a bullet. At the time, Trump's former White House doctor, Ronny Jackson, released a report saying his injuries from the incident were superficial. During Trump's first term in office, a White House doctor said he was in good health but needed to lose weight and exercise. On the campaign trail, Trump frequently attacked his rival, Biden, over his cognitive and physical health. After a poor debate performance last year against Trump, Biden declined to commit to taking a cognitive test, which he said he had not undergone while in office. The Democrat and his family were not injured, and a 38-year-old man faces charges of attempted murder and terrorism. The rapid change of Trump's tariff policy has shoppers wondering if they should stock up or just wait this out. It follows concerns that tech prices could skyrocket, as many gadgets are made in China, with the US president saying he will give more detail on Monday.

    "article_text": "This video can not be played McIlroy wins Masters play-off to complete career Grand Slam Masters final-round leaderboard -11R McIlroy (NI)*, J Rose (Eng) *McIlroy wins after first hole of sudden-death play-off Selected others:-9P Reed (US);-8S Scheffler (US);-7B DeChambeau (US), Im (Kor);-6L Aberg (Swe);-5X Schauffele (US);-3J Rahm, J Spieth (US), T Hatton (Eng);-2T Fleetwood (Eng);-1A Rai (Eng);+4D Willett (Eng), S Lowry (Ire) Full leaderboard The emotion of 14 years of trying came flooding out of Rory McIlroy as he realised his lifetime's ambtion of achieving golfing immortality with victory at Augusta National on Sunday. McIlroy rolled in a three-footer to beat Justin Rose in a sudden-death play-off to finally win his first Masters title and complete the career Grand Slam in a hugely dramatic final round. Having missed a par putt to win in regulation, McIlroy's birdie on the first extra hole denied his Ryder Cup team-mate as he claimed the biggest prize of his life. McIlroy let out a huge roar before collapsing to the ground and weeping tears of joy at the end of an extraordinary day of sporting theatre. \"I would say it was 14 years in the making,\" an emotional McIlroy said, referencing the 2011 Masters when he threw away a four-shot lead in the final round. \"A lot of pent-up emotion came out on the 18th green. A moment like that makes all the years and all the close calls worth it.\" Holding back more tears before he was helped into the Green Jacket by last year's winner Scottie Scheffler, McIlroy added: \"I want to say hello to mum and dad back in Northern Ireland. I can't wait to see them next week and can't wait to celebrate with them.\" Having won the US Open, The Open and two US PGA Championships by the end of 2014, McIlroy completes the full set of major championships at the 11th attempt. He becomes the sixth man - and first European - to clinch the Slam, joining Americans Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods and South Africa's Gary Player. It was another gut-wrenching Masters defeat for Rose, who also lost to Sergio Garcia in a play-off in 2017, but the 44-year-old Englishman deserves immense credit for bouncing back from a 75 on Saturday to push McIlroy all the way. Six key moments that won McIlroy the Masters The Masters - McIlroy wins play-off to complete career Grand Slam - reaction This video can not be played Watch McIlroy claim his Masters green jacket McIlroy's win is both the most significant achievement of his 18-year professional career and the culmination of a journey that has forced him to rebound from a series of major championship heartaches. It is fitting, too, that it is the most thrilling win of his career given the highs and lows he experienced over the final 18 holes. For a while, McIlroy threatened to add another to his list of recent near-misses. Back-to-back 66s gave him a two-shot lead to take into Sunday's final round but a double bogey on the first wiped out his advantage. However, from there he had three birdies in seven holes as he went four clear with nine to play, but four dropped shots in as many holes from the 11th gave hope to the chasing pack. And while others faded, 36-hole leader Rose birdied six of his final eight holes to force a play-off and keep alive the 2013 US Open winner's dream of winning the Masters at the 20th attempt. This video can not be played 'The shot of a lifetime' - McIlroy makes birdie for Masters lead All week, McIlroy has spoken about his ability to bounce back from setbacks. Key to his approach this week has been seeking advice from renowned sports psychologist Bob Rotella and McIlroy needed to lean heavily on his guidance during a final round that pushed him to the limit. Leading Bryson DeChambeau by two, McIlroy opened with a double bogey but regrouped to birdie three and four. After four straight pars, he picked up two more shots at nine and 10. At that point, McIlroy held a commanding four-shot lead as he threatened to pull away from the pack. But after dumping his third shot at the par-five 13th in the creek, he stumbled to another double bogey - his fourth of the week - and let another shot slip on the 14th. He regrouped to produce a stunning approach to 15, and while he missed his eagle putt, he followed a birdie with another gain on the 17th following a towering second shot from 196 yards to three feet. That took him to 12 under, one clear of Rose, who birdied the last, and needing a par on the 18th to win. There was another twist, however, as he pushed his approach into a greenside bunker and failed to sink his six-footer for par after splashing out of the sand, setting up a play-off with Rose. But McIlroy shook off that one last wobble to beat Rose and set the stage for remarkable scenes on the 18th green as he soaked in the acclaim and let his emotions flow. \"When I hit the wedge shot into the creek on 13 I felt I did a good job of bouncing back,\" added McIlroy. \"I was really nervous going out. It was almost as if the double bogey [at the first] calmed my nerves a little bit and got me into it. \"All week I responded to setbacks and that's what I'll remember. I'm so proud of that and being able to bounce back.\" Rose carded 10 birdies to force a play-off with McIlroy Sunday's round promised a thrilling sequel to McIlroy's duel with DeChambeau at last year's US Open. The American, who snatched a dramatic triumph at Pinehurst, was second after three rounds and looked poised to wreck the world number two's hopes again. But after a promising start which saw him take the lead with a birdie on the second hole, DeChambeau slipped to a three-over-par 75 as Rose - who started the day seven back - emerged as McIlroy's biggest challenger. Thirty-six hole leader Rose, who slipped down the leaderboard on Saturday with a 75, began with two birdies in his first three. While bogeys at four and five stalled his momentum, he picked up five shots in a seven-hole span to thrust himself into the mix. While former world number one Rose dropped further shots at 14 and 17, he birdied 15, 16 and drained a 20-footer on the last to pile the pressure on McIlroy before missing his birdie effort in the play-off. Having also finished runner-up at last year's Open Championship, it is another heartbreaking loss for Rose, but he played a central role in a Masters final round for the ages. \"He kind of gave me an opportunity on 18 from the fairway,\" said Rose of McIlroy's miscued approach to the last. \"That was nice of him. But then he closed the door beautifully on 18 with two great swings when it mattered most for him. \"What he's really learned to do this year is play much more controlled golf, and obviously it's paying off for him. He's having an unbelievable season.\" Sweden's Ludvig Aberg, who finished runner-up on his debut to Scheffler in 2024, briefly shared the lead with McIlroy and Rose but dropped four shots in his last two holes to finish seventh. Patrick Reed, champion in 2018, carded a closing 69, which was matched by two-time winner Scheffler, who finished a shot further back on eight under. The year is just beginning for McIlroy. Next month, he will attempt to win a sixth major at the US PGA Championship at Quail Hollow, a course where he was won four times. After that, McIlroy will seek to avenge his US Open heartache in 2023 and 2024 at Oakmont Country Club in June before rounding out the major season in July on home soil when the Open Championship returns to Royal Portrush, where he missed the cut in 2019. In September, McIlroy will also hope to help Europe retain the Ryder Cup against the United States at Bethpage Black in New York.

    "title": "'We had to put a smile on his face' - Newcastle dedicate win to Howe",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played We delivered a performance that Howe will be proud of - Tindall It was a familiar scene at St James' Park as Newcastle's players showed their appreciation to the Toon Army after another win - in what is turning into a highly impressive season. Harvey Barnes, clutching the man of the match award after his two goals inspired a crushing 4-1 victory over Manchester United, led the applause in front of the jubilant home fans. Sandro Tonali and Bruno Guimaraes, who also scored, were close by. But, on closer inspection, there was one notable absentee from the post-match celebrations. \"Hopefully this win will give him back some happiness and he'll be back for the next one,\" said Guimaraes, the captain, in a touching tribute to Eddie Howe. The Newcastle boss wasadmitted to hospitalon Friday having felt unwell for a number of days, leaving assistants Jason Tindall and Graeme Jones to oversee the win over the Red Devils. Newcastle's players responded with an exceptional performance as they recorded a first league double over their opponents since the 1930-31 campaign, but all thoughts turned to Howe after the game. The man who masterminded their Carabao Cup final triumph over Liverpool at Wembley four weeks ago is still in hospital, although details about his illness remain unclear. \"We knew we had a job to do without him, we said before the game we had to put a smile on his face,\" added Barnes. Bayindir's failed Man Utd audition offers Onana dilemma Newcastle beat Man Utd to boost Champions League hopes Newcastle boss Howe taken to hospital Tindall knows Howe better than most, having also been his assistant at Bournemouth. \"Me and Eddie have worked together for 17 years and in that time he's never missed more than a day or two, so he must have found it hard to be missing this week,\" said Tindall. \"All those years people have criticised me for being up at the front with Eddie... maybe that helped today! \"We went out and delivered a performance he would be proud of. Hopefully he is back very soon. \"Amongst our pressing was some fantastic football and some good goals.\" Tindall added that Howe, 47, had watched the game from his hospital bed and was well enough to send a message congratulating the team, having hammered Ruben Amorim's side to strengthen their push for a Champions League spot. \"I've just seen a message from him congratulating us,\" he added. \"He was able to watch the game, and I'm sure it lifted his spirits. \"He trusted the decision we'd make, we've been working together for a long time. \"He was able to communicate earlier on in the week, then put his trust in everyone to put in a performance he'd be proud of, and the boys delivered.\" Newcastle United fans held up a banner in support of Eddie Howe during the 4-1 win over Manchester United Tindall: Newcastle did Howe proud v Man U Ando reacts to Newcastle's \"decisive\" win v Man U Only runaway leaders Liverpool (41) have more points than Newcastle (36) since 14 December, having played two more games than the Magpies over the period. The win over Manchester United was Newcastle's 12th in 16 league matches - and their fourth in a row. If they make it five straight wins with a home victory over Crystal Palace on Wednesday, Newcastle will climb above Nottingham Forest into third. \"It's been a weird week without the gaffer being in,\" added Barnes. \"We know he wouldn't be missing games if he wasn't seriously ill. \"We went into the game today knowing exactly what we needed to do. It's just his voice and influence that hasn't been there this week.\" England boss Thomas Tuchel was at St James' Park to see Newcastle's fifth win in six meetings over Manchester United since losing the EFL Cup final at Wembley in February 2023. Barnes' one and only England appearance to date came against Wales in 2020. \"I'm playing with a smile on my face at the minute, enjoying being out there,\" added the winger. \"I love playing football, love scoring goals, when you do that you can't help but enjoy it. That was reflected in the team as well. It was a good day at the office.\" He added: \"We've got ourselves into a great position in the table, but we're just approaching each game as it comes. We know if we go and win our remaining games we will be in the top four.\" Latest Newcastle news, analysis and fan views Get Newcastle news sent straight to your phone",

    "title": "'A fascinating contrast between team-mates and title contenders'",
    "article_text": "Piastri is beginning to gain the upper hand against team-mate Norris in 2025 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix Venue:Jeddah Corniche CircuitDates:18-20 AprilRace start:18:00 BST on Sunday Coverage:Live radio commentary of practice and qualifying online and BBC 5 Sports Extra; race live on BBC Radio 5 Live. Live text updates on the BBC Sport website and app Lando Norris says \"something is just not clicking\" between him and his McLaren car so far this season. The Briton still leads the championship after finishing third in the Bahrain Grand Prix on Sunday. But his team-mate Oscar Piastri's accomplished, dominant victory - the Australian's second win in four races so far this season - reduced Norris' advantage to three points. Mathematically, Piastri is still suffering from the twists of fate in the first race of the season in Australia. There, both McLaren drivers ran off the track at the same time in a late shower of rain. But Norris' spin allowed him to continue on to victory, while Piastri became stuck on the wet grass, had to reverse back on to the track, and trailed home in ninth place. On balance, though, Piastri has been the more convincing McLaren driver this year - turning the tables on their form through 2024 - and Norris knows it. But for now, he is not sure what to do about it. \"I wish I knew the answer,\" Norris said. \"I don't have an answer, honestly. \"When you're an athlete, when you're a driver, you just know when things click, when you feel confident, when you feel comfortable. \"I'm confident that I have everything I need and I've got what it takes. I have no doubt about that - that I'm good enough, and all of those things. \"But something's just not clicking with me and the car. I'm not able to do any of the laps like I was doing last season. \"Then, I knew every single corner, everything that was going to happen with the car, how it was going to happen. I felt on top of the car. \"This year, I could not have felt more opposite so far. Even in Australia, whether or not I won the race, I never felt comfortable, never felt confident.\" The change in the balance of power at McLaren as a consequence has been stark. In 2024, Piastri out-qualified Norris only four times on merit all year - and only once in the final 16 races of the year - and the Briton's average pace advantage was 0.147 seconds a lap. This season, Piastri is 3-2 ahead out of all five qualifying sessions, including the sprint in China, and the Australian has on average been 0.185secs quicker. And qualifying ahead tends to lead to better race results. The contrast was very much on display in Bahrain. Norris fumbled his qualifying lap and lined up sixth on the grid. He recovered to third place but admitted that too many mistakes had prevented him from beating Mercedes' George Russell to second. Piastri was flawless in taking pole and a controlled, calm victory in which the destiny of the race never seemed in doubt. Piastri set himself the target this year of more consistently reaching his maximum potential, which he felt he had only accessed at times in 2024. And so far he has achieved his ambition. McLaren team principal Andrea Stella (centre) has worked with Fernando Alonso and Michael Schumacher in the past Combining consistent speed with the mental solidity and racing decisiveness he has always shown makes Piastri a formidable rival who, psychologically at least, will be a tough nut to crack. As McLaren team principal Andrea Stella put it in Bahrain: \"There's no noise in Oscar's head, which is a very useful characteristic in Formula 1, and I think this allows him to progress, to process information, to process what's available in the situations as a way of improving himself at a very fast rate.\" In Norris' head, there is noise. While Piastri keeps a very even keel, and gives the impression of being unflappable, Norris wears his heart on his sleeve, and lives his failings publicly. Which is not to say that it affects Norris' performance. As Norris puts it himself, this is just how he is. \"When I do my interviews and whatever,\" he says, \"a lot of it is probably just getting my frustration out. It's just because of not achieving what I want to achieve. It's because of my desire to do well and my ambition to win.\" But it does make for a fascinating contrast between the two McLaren team-mates and now title contenders. According to Stella, this is not a weakness in Norris. \"There is something important here,\" Stella says, \"which is something I admire in Lando, and makes me very privileged and lucky as a team principal, that he tends to absorb and point the blame on himself. \"Like yesterday, Q3, he didn't put the lap together, he raises his hand. Offloading entirely the team from like: 'You guys, not your problem, it was me.'\" Stella adds that Norris taking the blame on himself is \"inaccurate\". \"We know that we have made some changes to the car, which made Lando's life a bit more difficult,\" Stella says. \"We know technically what this is. Lando is adapting to this. Somehow potentially it might have played a bit more on Oscar's end, and we are working together to fix it.\" Essentially, the McLaren car is not giving Norris the feedback he needs for him to trust its front end when he is trying to take it to the limit in qualifying. Because it is unpredictable for him, he is finding it difficult to consistently replicate ultimate lap times. Piastri, with a different driving style, is not being affected in the same way. Stella says there is nothing different in Norris' reaction to not feeling at one with his car than with his previous charges, Michael Schumacher and Fernando Alonso, both of whom he worked with at Ferrari before moving to McLaren for 2015. \"I've seen various multiple world champions,\" Stella said. \"I have not seen any of them that, when there is a situation whereby you would like to do something with the car but the car doesn't do exactly what you would like, they are completely comfortable. \"It is an uncomfortable situation, but the way Lando is navigating through this situation, from a substantial point of view, is the same as other champions that I've seen in the past.\" McLaren are working on technical changes to address Norris' issues, but it is not yet known publicly when they will arrive, nor of course how effective they will be. It is adding an extra, unexpected twist to a title battle that at least so far seems to be slowly developing into an internal one between the two McLaren drivers. \"For myself,\" Piastri said, \"I've been comfortable - especially this weekend - in what the car's been able to do. And I think the team's been doing a great job. \"But it's still so early. At the moment, we've got a great car underneath us. I feel like for the most part we've been able to do a good job with it. \"I think there are going to be other contenders. And I think as long as we have the best car, it's going to be tight between Lando and I.\" Piastri dominates in Bahrain as Russell holds on to second Andrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questions How to follow Saudi Arabian Grand Prix on the BBC Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "Bayindir's failed Man Utd audition offers Onana dilemma",
    "article_text": "Altay Bayindir made his Premier League debut against Newcastle It was the last thing Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim needed. After taking goalkeeper Andre Onana out of the firing line for Sunday's trip to Newcastle, the Portuguese watched forlorn as replacement Altay Bayindir conceded four goals in achastening defeat at St James' Park. To makes matters worse, the Turkey international was to blame for Newcastle's fourth after a poor pass. \"We did a lot of mistakes that made it harder to win a game - that's all,\" said Amorim. \"It's a little bit of everything, it's hard to point to one thing.\" With a crucial Europa League quarter-final second leg to follow against Lyon on Thursday, United are keen to put defeat in the north-east quickly behind them. But Amorim now faces a potentially season-defining decision of whether to recall Onana or stick with Bayindir. Whether Onana was rested or simply dropped for the visit to Newcastle, the fact he wasn't even named on the bench was a brave decision from the United boss. Speaking before kick-off, former Manchester United captain Roy Keane said Amorim's patience with the Cameroon international had worn out. \"I think he (Onana) has done OK in the Premier League because United defensively actually haven't been too bad,\" Keane told Sky Sports. \"The keeper has made some big mistakes and he's been punished for it, so it's a big call for the manager.\" Onana came under fire again following two costly errors in the 2-2 first-leg draw in Lyon last Thursday. Since the start of last season, the 29-year-old has made eight errors leading to goals in all competitions, the most of any keeper playing for a Premier League club. \"The situation has been coming,\" former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson told 5 Live. \"A lot of Manchester United fans have been getting frustrated with him and there is a time where you do need to take the goalkeeper out of the firing line because the pressure does become too much. \"When you're in front of the opposition fans, you're reminded of your poor form every time you touch the ball and sometimes you do need a rest. \"It's good man-management to put your arm round him and say, 'look you're still my number one goalkeeper, but at the moment you're not playing to the levels I want you to play at - I'm going to take you out, whether it's one, two or three games'.\" Newcastle beat Man Utd to boost Champions League hopes Onana dropped from Man Utd squad to face Newcastle How does Onana compare to other Man Utd keepers after Matic criticism? Amorim may have been keen to stress Onana's omission was a one-game decision, but you don't drop your first-choice keeper at this stage of the season and do so lightly. Bayindir, a Â£4.3m signing from Fenerbahce in 2023, has waited patiently for his first start in the Premier League. But the 26-year-old failed to grasp his opportunity against Newcastle, conceding four of Newcastle's six shots on target and flapping at a number of crosses. He attempted 57 passes, but completed just 27 of those - an unimpressive rate of 47.4%. The most costly of those passes came 13 minutes from time, when Bayindir attempted a chipped pass into midfield that was cut out by Joelinton, allowing Bruno Guimaraes to add a fourth goal. Newcastle were already on their way to victory by then, but the passage of play underlined why, even with Onana making so many errors, Amorim has tended to keep faith with the former Inter Milan stopper. Amorim, understandably, was keen to move on from the defeat by Newcastle and stressed several times in his post-match interview how the focus was now firmly on the visit of Lyon. It's the biggest match of his United reign so far, keeping hopes alive of a trophy and place in next season's Champions League, but the Portuguese was giving nothing away when asked if he would recall Onana. \"You have to wait, we are going to start the next week,\" said Amorim. \"I'm going to choose the best starting XI for the next match.\" Robinson, though, thinks Onana's spell on the sidelines will continue. \"I don't think he's going to play [against Lyon],\" said the former Tottenham goalkeeper. \"You don't take him out for just one game, put him in a few days later and expect him to be on top of his game. I don't expect to see him play on Thursday.\" Latest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views Get Man Utd news notifications",

    "title": "Salah laps up contract acclaim - now Van Dijk may follow 'next week'",
    "article_text": "Mohamed Salah was given immense ovations both before the game and when he came off for Liverpool in the second half While any player's worth to a football team has to be measured in more than statistics, Mohamed Salah's goal and assist numbers show exactly why he is worth pretty much any amount of money a week for Liverpool. With his assist for Luis Diaz to open the scoringagainst West Ham on Sunday, Salah has now been directly involved in 45 Premier League goals this season - netting 27 and providing another 18. This is a new record for a player in a 38-game season, surpassing Thierry Henry from 2002-03 and Erling Haaland's total two years ago. Salah is now 15 goal involvements clear of any other player in Europe's top five leagues in 2024-25. Sunday also showed how important Alisson and Virgil van Dijk are as Liverpool close in on the league title - but without Salah, there most likely would be no title at all. With their second league title of the Premier League era seemingly sewn up weeks ago, the latter part of Liverpool's season has been largely focused on three key players out of contract in the summer. WhileTrent Alexander-Arnold seems Real Madrid-boundandVan Dijk is yet to formally sign a new deal,the future of Salahwas secured this weekto the joy of Liverpool fans. His performance on Sunday illustrated just why Liverpool were so keen to persuade him to turn down the millions of Saudi Arabia and stay on Merseyside, and just why the fans were so thrilled he did so. \"Mo Salah, Mo Salah, running down the wing,\" was the chant for much of the game while, when his name was announced in the pre-match line-up, it got one of the biggest cheers of the afternoon. And in the 18th minute, Salah responded with a beautifully played pass with the outside of his left boot, which was cleverly left by Diogo Jota to allow Diaz to slot home. This video can not be played How Liverpool mixed it up to take step closer to title It was a record-breaking assist for Salah, one which helped move Liverpool to within six points of a Premier League title - and their first won in front of fans following their triumph in the Covid-affected season in 2020. \"When we won it we won it in lockdown,\" Salah told Sky Sports after the game. \"So let's go for it and win it.\" Sunday was a game of three phases for Liverpool. The first half was the Salah phase, in which his brilliance put the Reds ahead and could have led to a goal or two more. The second phase was that of Alisson, whose brilliance between the sticks ultimately earned Liverpool the win more than any other factor. He missed the defeat at Fulham with concussion, and conclusively proved his importance here. And the final, shortest but most dramatic phase belonged to Van Dijk. After Liverpool were pegged back, the captain rose highest to meet an 89th-minute corner, score the winner and send both the Reds fans and manager Arne Slot into raptures. Liverpool's Virgil van Dijk (left) scored on what was his 100th game captaining the club \"As a manager you are looking for the ones who have achieved a lot already in their careers to step up,\" Slot said in his post-match media conference. \"It is always at the end of the season that the moments get bigger and bigger. \"Alisson had his best game of the season today, Virgil scored the header and Mo was again important, he was lively in the first half - we saw the Mo Salah again from the first part of the season.\" With Salah signed up and Alexander-Arnold seemingly out the door, attention now turns to the future of Van Dijk - and the Egyptian was making eyes at his captain after the game. \"I'm glad that we managed to do it before the end of the season and hopefully Virgil soon will be nice,\" Salah told Sky Sports. \"He can do whatever he wants but I would love to see him here again next year.\" This video can not be played Van Dijk reacts to Liverpool victory against West Ham Van Dijk, who marked his 100th match as Liverpool captain in the most dramatic fashion possible, dropped a hint of his own. \"Everyone knows how much I love this club so let's see what next week will look like,\" he said. Asked about this, Slot played a forward defensive of which England cricketing legend Sir Alastair Cook would be proud. \"I think he means, let's see what next week brings when we play Leicester City,\" he said, to chuckles from the assembled journalists. \"By far the most important thing this club is looking at is two more wins. \"We should be completely focused on that, my full focus is on Leicester and I'm sure Virgil's is as well.\" Slot is right to make sure his team are fully focused on the present task. They were below par against West Ham, who had most of the second-half momentum and twice hit the woodwork. But the job could be done next weekend, if Arsenal lose at Ipswich and Liverpool beat Leicester. Should the Gunners and the Reds go perfect in their upcoming games, Liverpool would win the title in their next home league game against Spurs - at the end of the month. Slot, for his part, is not fussy about where the trophy is secured. \"If I have to win it 50km from here or wherever, I don't care where to win it. We still have to win two more games,\" he said. But he would love to have Van Dijk's future officially resolved before the Dutchman lifts that trophy, to go alongside the priceless signature of Salah.

    "article_text": "This video can not be played Women's FA Cup highlights: Manchester City 0-2 Manchester United With their Women's Champions League qualification hopes hanging by a thread, an interim manager in charge and no silverware - what has gone wrong for Manchester City this season? It is not the way they pictured things after pushing Chelsea all the way in a pulsating Women's Super League title race last year, coming second only on goal difference. But when the full-time whistle went at the Joie Stadium on Sunday, ending City's last chance of winning a trophy this season, they had to stand and watch as rivals Manchester United celebratedreaching a third successive FA Cup finalwith their 2-0 win. An injury crisis, managerial upheaval and disappointing performances in the biggest moments have all contributed to what has been a season to forget. Any team without Vivianne Miedema, Khadija Shaw, Lauren Hemp and Alex Greenwood would drop their level. City's extensive injury list, which includes those key players, has severely impacted their campaign and thrust their lack of squad depth into question. Jill Roord, Aoba Fujino, Rebecca Knaak, Laura Coombs, Naomi Layzell and keeper Ayaka Yamashita have also missed a significant number of games this season as City currently sit fourth in the WSL, seven points adrift of Manchester United in the final Champions League spot with just four games left. They had only four outfield players on the bench in the second leg of theirWomen's Champions League quarter-final defeatby Chelsea, where the Blues overturned a 2-0 first-leg deficit, and have ended the season with academy graduates Gracie Prior and Lily Murphy starting almost every game. Interim manager Nick Cushing admitted the injury crisis \"100% needs to be examined\" in the summer - but it will not help his side now. \"With so many injuries, they can't be all bad luck and they can't all be down to bad practise,\" he said. \"We have to look at everything. We have to look at why we're sitting fourth in the league, why we've not won a trophy and why we've not got our best players [through injury]. \"The review process will be covering everything. I think we should be competing in every competition right until the end.\" While City's misfortune is clear, they also failed to act, unlike their rivals. When Chelsea superstar Sam Kerr suffered an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury last year, they broke the then-British record to bring in Colombian forward Mayra Ramirez. The WSL leaders then splashed the cash in a world-record deal for defender Naomi Girma in January after losing Kadeisha Buchanan, also to an ACL injury. Meanwhile, despite a growing injury list, City only signed four players in January, one of which was 20-year-old midfielder Aemu Oyama and allowed England international Chloe Kelly to join Arsenal on loan. \"Some of those [injured] players would walk into any team in the WSL,\" said former City and England captain Steph Houghton on BBC Two. \"If you take away Shaw, Miedema and Greenwood, that is a spine of experienced players and also good quality players. \"You've got a 20-year-old in Gracie Prior that has come through the academy and has played a lot of games recently. Should she be in the team? \"This is not down to individual performances but ultimately we are trying to build a squad to go and win trophies. \"We are missing some key players. That has proved the difference. Without a doubt the strength in depth isn't there and that is something we need to address.\" Holders Man Utd beat Man City to reach FA Cup final Man City's Miedema may miss rest of season with injury Chelsea show 'ruthless' mentality as quadruple bid still on It has been a tough few months for City and underpinning it all has been a managerial change. Having already fallen away in the WSL title race, the dramatic circumstances surroundingforward Kelly's exit in Januaryraised eyebrows. That led to divisions within the fanbase over former manager Gareth Taylor - but it was City's underwhelming performances that ultimately proved to be his downfall. Thedecision to sack Taylorwas a bold one as it came just days before a crucial two-week period in which City would face Chelsea four times in three competitions. \"Unfortunately we have just not had the rub of the green this season,\" Houghton added. \"The managerial change adds another factor to the performances we have seen over the past few months. \"Ultimately, this is a big learning curve and it's how we get better as a club going forward.\" Interim manager Cushing was brought back to the club to try to instil some stability and there were positive signs, but ultimately he did not have enough time to turn things around. At the end of an intense four-game battle with Sonia Bompastor's side, City had lost the Women's League Cup final, dropped further points in the WSL and were knocked out of Europe despite taking a two-goal first-leg advantage. It was a damaging period which left very little to play for and City's wounds were cut deeper when bitter rivals United punished them in the FA Cup. Asked if the semi-final defeat by United had effectively ended City's season, interim manager Cushing said: \"In the sense of trophies, it is over. We can't win a trophy. \"Mathematically we can still get third place [in the WSL]. I said after the game, 'we have to win out now'. We have to win every game. \"If we do that and Manchester United slip up in a difficult run of games, then we have a chance [of qualifying for Europe]. \"We have to play better and win at Old Trafford [in the WSL on 4 May]. We have to embrace the pressure and responsibility of that and fight through it.\" But what is most disappointing, is that City haven't competed with their rivals in the big games this season in the way many had expected. Their sole victory in those matches against Chelsea ultimately proved to be insignificant as it was in the first leg of their Champions League defeat. They were poor against Manchester United in the FA Cup semi-final, having already been beaten 4-2 by their rivals in the WSL at Etihad Stadium in January. And at the Joie Stadium in February, with a top-three WSL spot up for grabs, City conceded twice within eight minutes in a 4-3 loss to Arsenal. They have 11 points fewer in the league than they had at this stage last season, having scored nine goals less and conceding 11 more. \"No matter how it looks, you should compete. I would take any 11 players in the world and think we can win in a certain way,\" said Cushing after Sunday's loss. \"That might be our problem, that we don't have the toughness and desire to attack the game, however it looks. \"There is a lot of conversation nowadays about the beautiful side of the game - tactics and systems. But you have to win tackles, win duels and compete. \"We have to go away and figure that out so whoever we play and however we play, we can compete at the level our football club expects.\" Head here to get involved Get the latest WSL news on our dedicated page Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "More than 200 civilians killed as Sudan’s RSF attacks Darfur displacement camps",
    "article_text": "Paramilitaries in Sudan have murdered more than 200 civilians in a wave of attacks in displacement camps and around the city ofEl Fasher, the last big city still in the hands of the Sudanese army in the Darfur region. The deaths include at least 56 civilians killed by the Rapid Support Forces over two days of attacks in Um Kadadah, a town they seized on the road to El Fasher. The violence is some of the worst in the Darfur region since the civil war between the army and the paramilitary forces began almost exactly two years ago. The UN said killings were continuing at two large displacement camps, including of the entire medical staff of Relief International, which was operating the only remaining clinic inside Zamzam camp. RSF forces were said to be burning buildings throughout Zamzam on Sunday, claiming they were seeking Sudanese government fighters hiding in the camps. The US has condemned both sides in the war, saying the RSF has committed genocide in Darfur and that the army has attacked civilians. The conflict has essentially divided Sudan in two, with the army holding sway in the north and east while the RSF controls most of Darfur and parts of the south. The war has killed tens of thousands, uprooted more than 12 million and created what the International Rescue Committee described as “the biggest humanitarian crisis ever recorded”. The deaths at the weekend put extra pressure on the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, to deliver a decisive response on the issue of civilian protection when he convenes a ministerialconference on Sudanin London on Tuesday. The conference of 20 countries and organisations will inevitably shine a spotlight on the United Arab Emirates, past backers of the RSF, to issue an unambiguous statement of condemnation. The attacks on Um Kadadah, about 180km (112 miles) east of El Fasher, came one day after RSF fighters said they had taken the town from army forces. The victims appeared to be targeted because of their ethnicity. Lammy tweeted: “Shocking reports are emerging from El Fasher, Darfur, where indiscriminate RSF attacks have killed civilians, including aid workers. This gives added urgency to Tuesday’s Sudan conference in London with international partners. All sides must commit to protection of civilians.” The UN’s resident and humanitarian coordinator in Sudan, Clementine Nkweta-Salami, said she was “appalled and gravely alarmed by reports emerging from Zamzam and Abu Shouk displacement camps as well as El Fasher town in North Darfur”. The two camps protect as many as 700,000 civilians displaced by previous violence and famine. The Yale School of Public Health’s Humanitarian Research Lab said it had observed that “arson attacks have burned multiple structures and significant areas of the Zamzam camp in the centre, south and south-east portions of the camp”. The UN reported that the RSF had launched coordinated ground and air attacks on the camps and El Fasher from multiple directions on 11 April, triggering intense clashes and resulting in catastrophic consequences for civilians. The UN said more than 100 people, including more than 20 children, were feared dead, including nine Relief International personnel. The Sudanese army said more than 70 people had been killed in El Fasher alone. The precise death toll was unverifiable due to deliberate internet shutdowns implemented by the RSF. Last month the armyrecaptured the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, about 1,000km (600 miles) to the east. Adam Regal, a spokesperson for the General Coordination for Refugees and Displaced in Darfur, said Zamzam and Abou Shouk remained under artillery shelling and an assault by RSF armed vehicles on Sunday. Relief International said of the loss of its staff: “We understand this was a targeted attack on all health infrastructure in the region to prevent access to healthcare for internally displaced people. We are horrified that one of our clinics was also part of this attack – along with other health facilities in El Fasher.” Both the Biden and Trump administrations in the US have said the RSF has committed genocide in Darfur, and that the army has attacked civilians. The Sudanese government last week took the UAE to the international court of justice, the UN’s top court, claiming the UAE was complicit in genocide. Kate Ferguson, a co-director of Protection Approaches, said: “It appears that the RSF is attacking Zamzam, Abu Shouk and El Fasher simultaneously for the first time, including a ground assault on Zamzam. This is a significant escalation in violence against civilians in the North Darfur region and requires immediate diplomatic response.” She said she feared such “a coordinated military effort by the RSF would represent the beginning of the assault we have all so long feared – including further acts of genocide and crimes against humanity – and should trigger all emergency diplomatic and other responses.” She added: “In hosting the conference on Tuesday, Lammy holds the heavy responsibility of securing a collective response to the appalling atrocities committed yesterday and this weekend. It is a tough but rare opportunity to bring international commitment to protect civilians in Sudan from strong words to resolute action. “This means sincerely confronting those backing and enabling atrocity crimes, and establishing a serious senior coalition willing to advance at pace the political and technical solutions necessary to halt genocide, crimes against humanity, war and famine.”",

    "article_text": "The US has deported another 10 people that it alleges are gang members toEl Salvador, secretary of stateMarco Rubiosaid on Sunday, a day before that country’s president is due to visit the White House. “Last night, another 10 criminals from the MS-13 and Tren de Aragua Foreign Terrorist Organizations arrived inEl Salvador,” Rubio said in an X/Twitter post. Last night, another 10 criminals from the MS-13 and Tren de Aragua Foreign Terrorist Organizations arrived in El Salvador.The alliance between@POTUSand President@nayibbukelehas become an example for security and prosperity in our hemisphere. The alliance betweenDonald Trumpand El Salvador president Nayib Bukele “has become an example for security and prosperity in our hemisphere”, Rubio added. The US president is due to meet Bukele at the White House on Monday. It comes as US officials said in court filings on Sunday that they were not obliged to help a Maryland resident get out of prison in El Salvador after he was erroneously deported,despite a supreme court ruling directing the governmentto “facilitate” his return to the US. Attorneys for theTrump administrationsaid the high court’s order to “facilitate” the return of Abrego García, 29, meant they should “remove any domestic obstacles that would otherwise impede the alien’s ability to return here”, not help extract him from El Salvador. The Trump administration has acknowledged that García, a Salvadoran migrant who was living in Maryland and has had a work permit since 2019, was deported in March in violation of an immigration judge’s order blocking his removal to El Salvador. Trump administration lawyers wereable to confirmon Saturday that García remains confined in a notorious prison in El Salvador. Trump said on Saturday he was looking forward to meeting Bukele and praised him for taking “enemy aliens” from the United States. He said the two countries were working closely to “eradicate terrorist organizations”. Administration officials have repeatedly made public statements alleging that detained immigrants are gang members that they have not backed up in court. The Trump administration has deported hundreds of Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act. Lawyers and relatives of the migrants held in El Salvador say they are not gang members and had no opportunity to contest the US government assertion that they were. The Trump administration says it vetted migrants to ensure they belonged to Tren de Aragua, which it labels a terrorist organization. The deportations have been challenged in federal court. The US supreme court said the US government must give sufficient notice to immigrant detainees to allow them to contest their deportations. It did not say how those already in El Salvador could seek judicial review of their removals.",

    "title": "Ecuador to deliver verdict on ‘war on drugs’ in knife-edge presidential runoff",
    "article_text": "Ecuadoriansgo to the polls on Sunday in a vote seen as a referendum on a “war on drugs” offensive that has led to numerous human rights violations, as the incumbent Daniel Noboa faces the leftist Luisa González in a tightly contested runoff. Noboa, 37, edged out González, 47, in thefirst round in Februaryby just 16,746 votes (0.17%) from a 13.7 million electorate. Polls now indicate a statistical tie in the rematch of Ecuador’s 2023 runoff, when the then little-known heir to a banana fortune unexpectedlywon a snap electionto complete the term of former president Guillermo Lasso, who had dissolved Congress and stepped down to avoid impeachment. In his first months in office, Noboadeclared an “internal armed conflict”and placed the armed forces at the centre of hismano dura(iron fist) policy against drug-trafficking gangs. After an initial drop in crime, reports ofhuman rights violations mounted, and violence levels soon returned to previous highs: Ecuador still has thehighest homicide rate in Latin America, and the figures for January and Februaryare the highest on record. Last month, one of the most violent massacres in the country’s history took place in Socio Vivienda II, an impoverished neighbourhood in north-west Guayaquil, when22 people were killed in a confrontationbetween rival gang factions. “Everything is worse now,” said María, a Socio Vivienda II resident who asked not to be identified by her full name. “We’ve been abandoned by the state and left without the rule of law,” she said, adding that dozens of residents stillhad not been able to return homebecause of ongoing fighting. But violence is far from the only issue affecting Noboa’s popularity. An energy crisis led to scheduled blackouts of up to 14 hours,GDP fell by 1.5%and the poverty raterose from 26% to 28%between 2023 and 2024. “Life has become unbearable,” said María. “You only eat once a day, and then you have to save a little for the afternoon so the children have something to eat. We just want to live with dignity,” she added. In a YouGov survey commissioned by the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR), 61% of respondents said their economic situation and personal securityhad not improvedsince Noboa took office. “The economy is not doing better, security is not doing better, people are facing blackouts, and they’re also witnessing a deterioration of the rule of law, with growing disregard for the constitution,” said Pedro Labayen Herrera, a researcher at CEPR specialising inEcuador. The political analyst Matías Abad Merchán said: “Despite Noboa having been in power for a short time, a small anti-Noboa segment of the electorate has indeed emerged – one that genuinely feels the president displays certain authoritarian tendencies.” The president refused to step down during the electoral campaign period, as required by the constitution. He also sparked an unprecedented diplomatic crisis by ordering police and military forces tostorm the Mexican embassy in Quitoto arrest Jorge Glas, once a vice-president under the former leftist president Rafael Correa. Correa – who has lived in Belgium since leaving office and was convicted in 2020 by an Ecuadorian court for corruption during his presidency – is González’s political patron. Noboa, on the other hand, has made efforts to showcase support from the US president: the Ecuadorian leader left his country in the middle of the campaign to travel to Florida, where heposed for a photo with Donald Trumpat his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach. The incumbent has become embroiled in several controversies in the race’s final stretch. He announced a“strategic alliance” with Erik Prince– the Trump-aligned founder of the controversial private military firm Blackwater – to supposedly reinforce his “war” on crime. In early April, the Brazilian investigative outlet Pública revealed that at least three timescocaine has been foundhidden in banana containers being sent to Europe by a company in which Noboa and his brother are the majority shareholders. During a presidential debate, Noboa denied any wrongdoing and said that the family’s banana company was cooperating with investigators. After the first round, Noboa alleged – without providing evidence – that there had been “irregularities”, a claimpromptly rejected by observersfrom the European Union and the Organization of American States. For the runoff, he stated that he would only accept defeat “if there was no indication of fraud”. “So if things don’t go his way, I think there’s a real risk that he won’t accept the results,” said Herrera. On Wednesday, 14 Democratic members of the US Congresssent a letterto the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, expressing concern that Noboa might not accept the results if he loses: “It’s therefore imperative that you send a clear message to the government of Ecuador and other Ecuadorian leaders emphasising the need for a free, fair and transparent electoral process, and noting that, if electoral observers determine these conditions to be met, the outcome of the election must be respected,” they wrote.",

    "title": "UK could target parts of Chinese state under new foreign influence rules",
    "article_text": "The government could target parts of China’s security apparatus under new foreign influence rules, the Guardian has learned. Ministers are considering including parts of the Chinese state accused of interference activities on the enhanced tier of the foreign influence registration scheme (Firs). China as a whole is not expected to be included on the enhanced tier, according to several people briefed on the discussions, but government sources stressed that no final decision about its status had been taken. Firs, which will launch on 1 July, will require anyone in the UK acting for a foreign power or entity to declare their activities to the government. The scheme will operate on two tiers. The enhanced tier will cover countries and entities deemed a particular risk, which will require extra disclosures. Ministers have announced that Iran and Russia will be on the enhanced tier, meaning anyone directed by those two countries to carry out activities in the UK will have to declare it or face five years in prison. The government has yet to say anything about China’s place in Firs, a matter which is subject to internal debate by ministers and officials weighing up security concerns against the economic benefits of closer ties with Beijing. Financial services companies have privately argued against including China on the enhanced tier on the basis that they would have to fill out burdensome paperwork to justify business meetings. In an effort to strengthen security without compromising economic ties, ministers are considering including specific parts of the Chinese political system that have beenaccused of interferencein the west on the enhanced tier. Entities under consideration include Beijing’s Ministry of State Security, which is its intelligence service, the United Front Work Department, often referred to as the international arm of the Chinese Communist party (CCP), and the People’s Liberation Army, China’s military. The government could also target the CCP as a whole. A Home Office spokesperson said: “We do not comment on security matters.” MI5’s director general, Ken McCallum,said in a 2022 speechthat “the Chinese intelligence services, or bodies within the CCP itself – such as its United Front Work Department (UFWD) – are mounting patient, well-funded, deceptive campaigns to buy and exert influence” in the UK. McCallum said the UFWD aimed “to amplify pro-CCP voices, and silence those that question the CCP’s legitimacy or authority”. He said its activities had “very real consequences in communities here in the UK” and that “it needs to be challenged”. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Conservative MPs have called forChina to be included in the enhanced tier. The shadow security minister, Tom Tugendhat, told the Commons last year that “the advice from MI5 was very, very clear. If China isn’t in the enhanced tier, it’s not worth having.” There are long-running tensions over the issue between the Home Office and the Treasury, which is relaying concerns about the potential burden on businesses. Labour has pursued a rapprochement with Beijing since taking office. The foreign secretary, David Lammy, and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, have made trips to China in an effort tomaintain positive economic relationsdespite security concerns. Douglas Alexander, a trade minister,became the latest government figure to visit China last weekfor talks amid the intensifying trade dispute between Beijing and Washington. China is the UK’s fifth-largest trading partner. The government is also carrying out a cross-Whitehall audit of the UK-China relationship, which was a Labour manifesto pledge.",

    "title": "Xi Jinping seeks to strengthen economic ties during tour of south-east Asia",
    "article_text": "The Chinese president,Xi Jinping, will visit Vietnam on Monday as he begins a tour of south-east Asia where he will seek to strengthen ties with neighbouring countries amid an escalating trade war. Xi will visit Vietnam from Monday before travelling to Malaysia andCambodia, a high-profile tour that Chinese officials have described as being of “major importance”. China will probably use the visit to emphasise that it is a stable partner, contrasting itself with Washington which imposed, then suspended,punishing tariffs across south-east Asia, an export-reliant region, in anannouncement that sent shock wavesthrough global markets. Vietnam, a manufacturing powerhouse, and Cambodia, where the garments and footwear sector is crucial to the economy, were among the worst hit by US tariffs, set at 46% and 49% respectively. It is expected thatChinawill sign dozens of deals with Vietnam on Monday including possible investment and cooperation arrangements to develop its railway network. On Sunday, China called on the US to “completely cancel” its 145% tariffs for Chinese imports to the US, except in relation toconsumer electronics and key chipmaking equipment. “We urge the US to … take a big step to correct its mistakes, completely cancel the wrong practice of ‘reciprocal tariffs’ and return to the right path of mutual respect,” a commerce ministry spokesperson said in a statement. Retaliatory Chinese-imposed tariffs of 125% on US goods took effect on Saturday. Stephen Olson, a former US trade negotiator, who is now a visiting senior fellow at the ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute, said that during Xi’s tour of neighbouring countries, China would probably “try to position itself as the responsible leader of the rules-based trade system while painting the US as a rogue nation intent on taking a sledgehammer to trade relationships”. It was unclear if meaningful, concrete agreements would emerge from the meetings, but they would be symbolically important, Olson added. For officials in Hanoi, the visit will form part of a delicate balancing act between China and the US, both of which are important economic partners. The US is a crucial export market for south-east Asia and a security partner that serves as a counterbalance to China’s assertiveness in the disputed South China Sea. However, trade in the region is closely intertwined with China, with countries from the regional bloc, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, counting as the biggest recipient of Chinese exports last year, according to China’s customs data. There are concerns in the region that the 145% tariff imposed on China by the US could lead to a flood of cheap Chinese goods to nearby countries, undermining local industry. Vietnam and many others in the region have traditionally sought to avoid taking sides between the US and China and will want to avoid antagonising either party, especially as it tries to persuade Washington to lower its 46% tariff. Vietnam, where US exports account for 30% of GDP, had already made several concessions in the run-up to the tariff announcement, and was shocked by the severity of the tariff announced this month. It has since sent the deputy prime minister, Ho Duc Phoc, to Washington, offered to remove all tariffs on US imports and promised to buy more US goods, including defence and security products. Vietnam is also preparing to crack down on Chinese goods being shipped from its territory to the US and tighten controls on sensitive exports to China, according to a Reuters report. This includes stricter rules relating to the export of dual-use goods such as semiconductors, which can be used for both civilian and military purposes, it was reported. Vietnam was considered by many to be a winner in the trade war that occurred under the last Trump administration, as many companies moved there from China to skirt tariffs imposed by the US. However, this caused Vietnam’s trade surplus with the US to surpass $123bn (£94bn), leaving it especially vulnerable in the latest tariff announcement. Vietnam, a communist one-party state, has set an ambitious target of becoming a high-income nation by 2045 – a goal driven by its exports, which would be derailed by the 46% tariff. Cambodia and Malaysia are also seeking to negotiate with Trump. The US tariffs could devastate Cambodia’s garment industry, which employs 750,000 workers. Cambodia is especially exposed as exports to the US account for 25% of the country’s GDP.Xi last visited Vietnam in December but he has not travelled to Cambodia and Malaysia in nine and 12 years respectively. China’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Lin Jian, said the visit to Malaysia would mark “an important milestone” for the two countries, while describing Cambodia as an “iron-clad friend”. The Malaysian communications minister, Fahmi Fadzil, said Xi’s visit was “part of the government’s efforts … to see better trade relations with various countries including China”. Cambodia is one of China’s strongest allies in the region and it recently announced the completion of a China-backed project toupgrade a major naval base. The country’s prime minister, Hun Manet, who took the reins from hisdictator father Hun Senin 2023, said at the recent inauguration of a Chinese-funded road that “Cambodian-Chinese ties have not changed”. Xi’s visits form part of a wider charm offensive pursued by China in the wake of the trade war. Xi also vowed to deepen China’s strategic partnership withIndonesiain a call with that country’s president, Prabowo Subianto, on Sunday, China’s official Xinhua news agency reported. On Friday, Xi told the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, during a meeting in Beijing that China and the EU should “jointly oppose unilateral acts of bullying”, Xinhua reported. China’s premier, Li Qiang, spoke by phone with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, last week for talks that emphasised the responsibility of both parties to support a “strong reformed trading system, free, fair and founded on a level playing field”.",

    "article_text": "Labor would provide health workers with training to care for LGBTIQA+ Australians in a $10m package to upskill doctors and nurses alongside a new accreditation program, the health minister,Mark Butler, has said. The election promise, to be announced on Monday, would see Labor contract a training provider to design programs to train healthcare workers to help give “inclusive, culturally safe primary care” for gay, lesbian and gender-diverse Australians. “A re-elected Albanese Labor Government will continue to work in partnership with the LGBTIQA+ community to improve inclusive care nationwide,” Butler said. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter The minister’s office said that after the election Labor wouldopen a competitive grants process to choose a training provider. It is understood the exact details of the course, and what specific issues or factors it would address, would be contingent on the program designed by the successful provider. The government pointed to related health announcements – including grants for health services, greater data collection, health and medical research, efforts to address HIV transmission, mental health supports and expanding IVF access – in making the announcement. Labor said it would also introduce a voluntary accreditation program “so that healthcare providers can be recognised for meeting best practice for LGBTIQA+ care, helping patients identify safe and trusted services”. “I am proud of the strides we’ve taken in our first term of government, from securing PrEP during supply shortages, to investing in medical research and delivering the first ever LGBTIQA+HealthAction Plan,” Butler said. The assistant health minister, Ged Kearney, said the funding would aim to “break down the barriers that prevent too many LGBTIQA+ Australians from getting the care they need”. The Health Equity Matters chief executive, Dash Heath-Paynter, said a focus on providing appropriate care for gender- and sexuality-diverse Australians was “vital”. “With higher-than-normal rates of mental and physical health challenges, this funding directly addresses critical barriers to care,” Heath-Paynter said.

LGBTIQ+ Health Australia’s chair, Carolyn Gillespie, said a lack of inclusivity could be a barrier to seeking care. “Building the capacity of primary care to ensure LGBTIQA+ people have equitable access is greatly needed,” she said. “It is critical that this commitment supports LGBTIQA+ community-controlled health and wellbeing organisations to play a central role so that ongoing meaningful relations with Primary Health Networks can be enhanced and sustained.”",

    "article_text": "In 2022 Ramsay HealthcareopenedAustralia’s first women’s-only hospital “dedicated” to trauma-related mental health issues in Wollongong. Ramsay Clinic Thirroul was supposed to bea “gamechanger”designed specifically to provide women – often survivors of family and sexual violence – the safe environment needed to be able to escape theflight or fight stress responseand begin to recover through aprogram of therapies. But the facility run by Australia’s largest private hospital operator has since dropped the emphasis on care “dedicated” to trauma patients on its website, now describing itself as providing a range of “women’s mental health services”. It is now a general female-only psychiatric unit which – like many other Ramsay facilities – has a public-private contract with NSWHealth, allowing it to take public patients who do not have access to public beds. The changes to the hospital come against the backdrop of the mass resignation of New South Wales public-sector psychiatrists which has led to thestate government asking Ramsay facilities to take public mental health patients. When Olivia* stayed in the facility for the first time in March 2024 to receive treatment for PTSD from childhood trauma, she described the experience as “very helpful and I felt I gained a lot out of it”. But when she returned in February to be admitted for the second stage of the program, she says the experience left her “struggling more than I did before I was admitted”. She was unaware that the clinic had begun accepting women detoxing from drugs and alcohol. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter “For those such as myself whom have PTSD surrounding drugs and alcohol from childhood trauma, this makes this a place that doesn’t fit my needs of feeling safe and less vulnerable [while] having treatment,” she said. Olivia said there were a few patients detoxing there and she was “majorly triggered and abused” by one of them on the second-last day of her stay. When Olivia was sitting with a nurse completing her discharge paperwork, this other patient demanded to speak with the nurse “but not in front of ‘that’, referring to me”, she said. “I found myself highly in flight mode and before I knew it I was heading out the driveway walking towards the street and towards the train station. This triggered the emotional flashbacks and lack of safety from the abuse my brother implemented on me in my younger years.” Ramsay said it was not previously aware of Olivia’s concerns but took them seriously and would welcome the opportunity to speak directly to her. Olivia said while she understood women detoxing from substances needed support and help, she was not sure she would seek help again from the clinic after the way things ended. A psychiatrist and another staff member who resigned from Ramsay Clinic Thirroul told Guardian Australia the psychiatrists who began the venture and the team who wrote the program for the hospital have all since resigned. Guardian Australia understands more than half of the patients admitted lately were under a drug and alcohol specialist as the trauma specialists had either already left or were planning to leave. Rose Jackson, the NSW mental health minister,told the upper house on 27 Marchshe was aware Ramsay Clinic Thirroul was no longer providing specialised trauma care and had reverted to a general women’s mental health facility, in response to questions from Dr Amanda Cohn, the NSW Greens’ spokesperson for mental health. Jackson said as it was a private facility, this was not a decision made by NSW Health.

Cohn told the parliament that the change to the Thirroul clinic left NSW without a specialist inpatient trauma service for survivors of family violence and sexual assault, which she said was “an urgent, ongoing need”. “One of the most important components of trauma‑sensitive or trauma-informed mental health care is continuity of care,” she said. “It is reliability, predictability and a long-term relationship so that people do not have fragmented care.” She added that mental healthcare in the state had become increasingly fragmented. The NSW public sector has a longstanding shortages of psychiatrists, with a pre-existing vacancy rate of more than a third of permanent staff specialist positions. The NSW branch of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists wrote to the state government on 13 October 2023 detailing the workforce crisis with difficulties in recruitment, training and retention. After 16 months of negotiations with the government failed to reach a solution, the remaining public sector psychiatristsstarted resigning en masse in Januaryin a dispute that remains before arbitration in the NSW industrial relations court. Before the psychiatrists threatened resignation, Ramsay Health Care Australia had been advocating for their available private hospital beds to be used to address unmet public demand. In a submission to the NSW special commission of inquiry into healthcare funding dated October 2023, the chief policy officer for Ramsay wrote: “RHCA [Ramsay Health Care Australia] encourages governments to partner with the private system to support delivering essential services given the private system has the capital and workforce to address government dilemmas, such as mental health and elective surgery demands.” A spokesperson for the Illawarra Shoalhaven local health district, which provides public health services for the Wollongong area, said the district had a longstanding agreement with the Ramsay clinic to be available to support the provision of non-acute mental health services if the need arose but that had not been required so far. Dr Pramudie Gunaratne, the NSW chair of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists, said: “We are starting to see workforce shortages in private hospitals too, which limits the ability of these hospitals to take on additional patients. “These public-private partnerships are not only incredibly expensive for the taxpayer, they are also unsustainable given the current workforce issues and we have serious safety concerns for patients and staff as these facilities are generally not equipped with the infrastructure and staffing to care for patients with high acuity needs.” A Ramsay Health Care spokesperson said: “Ramsay Clinic Thirroul is a women-only mental health facility specialising in trauma-informed care. Since opening more than two years ago, the clinic has supported women with complex PTSD, often alongside other mental health or physical health conditions … “Ramsay Clinic Thirroul remains committed to providing high-quality, personalised care in a safe, respectful environment for women experiencing trauma.” *Name changed to protect anonymity",

    "title": "Civilian deaths in Sumy attack may force Washington to get tough with Putin",
    "article_text": "Even by the warped standards of wartime, Russia’s Sunday morningattack on Sumywas astonishingly brazen. Two high-speed ballistic missiles, armed, Ukraine says, with cluster munitions, slammed into the heart of the border city in mid-morning as families went to church, waited for a theatre performance or were simply strolling about on a mild spring day. The death toll currently stands at 34, including two children. Images from the scene show bodies or body bags on the ground, a trolley bus and cars burnt out, rubble and glass scattered around. It was reckless, cruel and vicious and its consequences entirely predictable to those who gave the order and pressed “launch”. To contemplate a daytime city-centre attack, in the full knowledge that civilians will be present, reflects a Russian culture of impunity that has been allowed to endure without effective challenge. Nevertheless, Washington’s approach, underDonald Trump, has been to try to negotiate an end to the war by talking directly with Moscow, while remaining mostly silent on Russian attacks on civilians. Talks between the US and Russia have continued unabated over the past two months at a time when Russian attacks on Ukraine’s cities appear to have stepped up. Nine adults and nine children were killed whena Russian ballistic missile using cluster bombs struck a children’s playground in Kryvyi Rihat the end of last week. People were burned alive in their cars and the bodies of children were found dead in the playground, yet the attack was weakly condemned by the US ambassador toUkraine, Bridget Brink, who, toeing the White House line, would not say the deadly missile was from Russia as she tweeted: “This is why the war must end.” Brink has since announced she will step down and been more forthright. On Sunday, the ambassador attributed the Sumy attack to Russia and repeated that it appeared cluster bombs had been used. But now that she is on her way out, it is easier for her to speak her mind while Russia’s Vladimir Putintoys with Trumpand the rest of the US administration in peace talks that have hardly developed in two months. On Friday, the Russian leader spent four hours in talks with Steve Witkoff, a donor real estate developer who has become a key Trump adviser on Ukraine as well as the Middle East. What they talked about is unclear, but reports suggest Witkoff has been pushing the idea that the quickest way to getRussiato agree a ceasefire in Ukraine is to force Kyiv to hand over the entirety of four provinces that are only partly occupied by Russia’s military, including the cities of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. The dissonance between the killing and destruction in Sumy on Sunday and the photographed handshake between Witkoff and Putin is all too evident to most observers. It is not clear why it should even be contemplated that Ukraine hand over territory (something that even the US cannot easily force on Kyiv) when Russia is willing to countenance daytime attacks on civilians. Sign up toHeadlines Europe A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day after newsletter promotion But Moscow believes, and acts like it believes, it can get away with it. The Kremlin will ignore condemnation from European leaders and wait for the news cycle to move on – and will almost certainly continue to attack Ukrainian cities to little military purpose. Not only are drone attacks commonplace, but there are now concerns they are routinely being armed with cluster munitions, while almost every day one or two hard-to-intercept ballistic missiles are thrown into the deadly mix. In Kyiv, PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyhopes that gradually Trump will realise Putin is not negotiating in good faith. Certainly, the attack on the centre of Sumy hardly suggests a strong appetite for peace. But it is unclear at what point, if any, the White House is prepared to conclude that killing of civilians means that it needs to put genuine pressure on Russia to negotiate rather than indulge the Kremlin.",

    "title": "Russian missile strike kills dozens in Ukrainian city of Sumy",
    "article_text": "At least 34 people have been killed and more than 100 injured in a Russian ballistic missile strike in the Ukrainian city of Sumy as people were going to church for Palm Sunday, in the worst attack on civilians this year. Two missiles landed in the crowded city centre on Sunday morning. One hit a trolley bus full of passengers. Footage from the scene showed bodies lying in the street, burning cars, and rescuers carrying bloodied survivors. Two of the dead were children. “My seven-year-old son was running for shelter when the second missile struck. The blast ripped off a door which hit him in the leg. He has a bruise but is OK,” saidVolodymyr Niankin, a film director. “My son said this is the most terrible day of his life.” Niankin said he saw bodies on the ground. “Many of the people who died were sitting on the bus or walking in the road. A lot of people were out and about because it was a religious festival. I think this is genocide.” Ukraine’s president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said there were “dozens of dead and wounded civilians”. He accused Russia of carrying out an act of deliberate terror and said tough reaction was needed from the US, Europe and the rest of the world. “Enemy missiles hit an ordinary city street, ordinary life: houses, educational institutions, cars on the street … And this on a day when people go to church: Palm Sunday, the feast of the Lord’s entry into Jerusalem,” heposted on social media. Zelenskyy said the Kremlin was ignoring a US proposal for a full and unconditional ceasefire. “Unfortunately, there in Moscow they are convinced they can keep killing with impunity. Action is needed to change this situation,” he said. Officials said 117 people had been injured, including 15 children. There was widespread international outrage. Donald Trump’s envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said the attack “crosses any line of decency”. “As a former military leader, I understand targeting and this is wrong. It is why President Trump is working hard to end this war,”he wrote on X. The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, said he was “appalled at Russia’s horrific attacks on civilians”. Vladimir Putin “must now agree to a full and immediate ceasefire without conditions”, he said. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, agreed on the “urgent need to impose a ceasefire on Russia”. “Everyone knows it is Russia alone that wants this war,” he said. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, described the scenes from Sumy as heartbreaking and horrific. The EU’s ambassador toUkraine, Katarína Mathernová, called the strikes a war crime. “Nothing seems to be sacred to the Russians – neither churches, nor Ukrainian children,” she said. Ukrainians contrasted the images of bodies in Sumy with photos of Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, warmly shaking hands with Putin on Friday. The two held four hours of talks in St Petersburg. Putin’s press spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on Sunday that the talks were going very well but that it was “impossible to expect any instant results”. Trump has said he is “pissed off” at Russia’s failure to stop bombing, but has so far not taken any concrete measures against Moscow. Ukraine has signed up to a 30-day ceasefire that Washington proposed a month ago. Since then, Russia has escalated its bombardment of Ukrainian cities, firing 70 missiles and 2,200 drones. Nine children and nine adults were killed earlier this month when a Russian missilehit a playgroundin the city of KryvyiRih. Zelenskyy has been pressing allies to send another 10 Patriot air defence systems to protect Ukraine’s skies. “Talks have never stopped ballistic missiles and air bombs. We need the kind of attitude towards Russia that a terrorist deserves,” he said on Sunday. Sumy is 15 miles (25km) from the border with Russia and is a major Ukrainian military hub. The missiles landed in a central civilian area where many people carrying willow branches for Palm Sunday were on their way to church. Video from a car dashcam shows an orange flash as one of the missiles struck at 10.20am. Plumes of grey smoke can be seen as other vehicles reverse away from the danger and passersby run in panic. The first missile hit aconference centre belonging to Sumy’s state university. Several children were waiting outside for an 11am theatre performance in a basement venue. The second landed 200 metres away, in Pokrovska Street, as the trolley bus rolled past. Niankin said the centre was a unique arts hub and home to a theatre he ran. “I feel like half of my heart has been taken away. It was a place where we could play and create. Everything is destroyed: the stage, costumes, all our stuff. We have no chance to continue our work,” he said. The director, who made afilm about Sumy’s resistanceto Russia’s 2022 invasion, said there were not a lot of people inside the building when it was flattened. “It happened half an hour before the show was due to start. My son was nearby attending a class in a studio.” Ukraine’s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, said Russia had launched two Iskander-M missiles from its western territory in the Voronezh and Kursk regions. He identified the army forces responsible as the 112th and 448th missile brigades. “Another proof of the godlessness of the disgusting cursed Moscow,” he said.",

    "title": "‘That serene Scandinavian facade, yet there’s terror underneath’: artist unveils design for Norwegian national memorial to 22 July attacks",
    "article_text": "Fourteen years ago, the heart of Oslo was reconfigured by hate. On 22 July 2011, Norwegian neo-Nazi Anders Behring Breivik detonated a car bomb outside the office of the then prime minister Jens Stoltenberg, killing eight people and damaging surrounding buildings, before murdering a further 69 people on the nearby island of Utøya. But now the same site is to be reconfigured by hope. Last week, after a multi-round, three-year-long selection process, a jury of curators, politicians, artists and representatives of the victims and survivors of the attacks announced the winning design for a new Norwegian national memorial to be unveiled in time for the 15th anniversary in 2026. Norwegian artist Matias Faldbakken’s mosaic Upholding, 12 metres high and 15 metres wide, and made of some 500,000 stones, shows a wading bird native to Utøya reflected in the lake. It is a monumental piece that touches on both societal support and nature. And a mosaic, Faldbakken argues, is the perfect symbol for a memorial site. “A fragmented image, every part plays its role. In old literature, it’s called painting for eternity. A mosaic is one of the only image formats that survives fire, earthquakes and floods.” The mosaic will be braced by a steel rig similar to the one that once secured Pablo Picasso’s mural The Fishermen on one of the blast-damaged blocks in the quarter. Faldbakken, who representedNorwayat the Venice Biennale in 2005, explains that he was initially inspired by walking past the rig holding Picasso’s work, which stood in the Government Quarter for almost three years. But the main purpose of the monument is not to reference the work of another artist but to serve as “a window to the other crime site”, explains Faldbakken. After triggering the Oslo blast, Breivik travelled to the island of Utøya in Tyrifjorden, a lake 40km northwest of Olso, where he attacked a summer camp for the Labour party’s youth wing (AUF). Most of the 69 victims were teenagers. “I was out on the island many times,” Faldbakken says. “I started to research the birds. And this small wader had a lot of physical traits that I thought worked: a very small, fragile and light bird with its thin legs. But it has this angle to it. It has a gaze. It pushes you a little bit back.” On Faldbakken’s last visit to Utøya, the lake was completely still, the water a mirror, which inspired the bird’s reflection in the design. It is not meant as a clear symbol of life and death. “This is a very peaceful image but it is almost like a Rorschach test. It has this duality,” he notes. “Breivik was a homegrown terrorist, which mystified this country at the time. There’s that serene Scandinavian facade, and yet there’s the terror underneath.” Survivors and the relatives of those killed will be involved in placing the stones into the composition. The names of the 77 people who died will be engraved on the base of the work. Regitze Schäffer Botnen, who was a 17-year-old participant at the Utøya camp on 22 July, was a member of the jury. Initially she felt that she was representing all the survivors, “And then I realised that is an impossible task. So, I figured out that I had to dig deeper into the subject and listen to other survivors and people who lost their children, and ask the question not what do you like the most but what is a good memorial? To see what kind of conversation that started, and learn from it.” The transparency and public engagement in the selection process was in part a result of the backlash against a rushed commission for a memorial on Utøya island in 2014. The chosen work, Jonas Dahlberg’sMemory Wound, proposed a permanent three-and-a-half metre gap be cut through the island. The concept was considered by many as memorialising one act of violence with another, andthe project was subsequently dropped. “It didn’t have the grounding of what we’re doing now,” Faldbakken says, tactfully. “And it was very much in the backyard of many people who lived close to Utøya, and were the people who took out their boats and saved the kids.” In 2012, Breivik received a 21-year-sentence, the longest that can be handed down in Norway. “He might theoretically walk past the memorial a free man some time in the future, but it is highly unlikely,” says Thomas Ugelvik, a professor of law at Oslo University. Breivik received aforvaringsentence, which is indeterminate. If he still poses a threat to society the sentence can be extended, potentially for the rest of his life. Arguably, the greatest memorial to 22 July would be the impossibility of such an attack happening again. “We have a greater focus on emergency preparedness than we did before the attack, as well as many safety measures around governmental buildings and critical infrastructure,” says Jens Stoltenberg, who went on to become general secretary of Nato and is now finance minister of Norway. “But no measure can serve as a guarantee against terrorism or extremism. In that sense a memorial is important as a constant reminder of something we would never want to experience again, and that our free and open society can never be taken for granted.” In the wake of 22 July, led by a public address from Stoltenberg, Norwegians came together. Thousands of people participated in a “rose march” the following week, walking from the town hall to Oslo Cathedral holding roses in defiance of extremism. Faldbakken was in the US at the time of the attacks, but two of his children were in Oslo. “It had an echo in our family life, because the kids were really shocked by it. I jumped on the first plane and came back.” Having to take so many peoples’ views and feelings into account while designing the memorial was a very different practice for Faldbakken. “I stood on the side as an artist and thought I’d make the best work I can based on this idea. Pretty early on I took myself and my artist’s ego out of the equation. It was not about me any more; it was about them.”",

    "article_text": "A 63-year-old British man has died after falling from a viewing platform overlooking the historic aqueduct of Segovia in central Spain, according to local authorities. In a brief statement on Saturday, officials described the man as a British passport holder who had arrived in the city on Thursday with two other people. Initial reports suggested he had been sitting on the ledge of the stairs leading to the lookout point and fell backwards after losing his balance, the local newspaper El Norte de Castillareported. City officials said the man, who has yet to be named, fell from the metres-high viewpoint shortly after 1pm local time (1200 BST) on Saturday. Emergency officialssaidthey rushed to the scene and attempted to revive him. The incident took place at a lookout point known as Postigo del Consuelo, which is tucked into remains of the medieval walls that surround the city. The small viewing platformhas longattracted throngs of tourists and local people for the sweeping views it offers of the city and aqueduct. With two tiers of arches and stretching more than 800 metres in length, the Roman aqueduct is believedto have been built aroundAD50. It was used until the 1970s to channel water to the city from nearby mountains. Declared a Unesco world heritage site in 1985, it stands at more than 28 metres above ground at its highest point. As is customary in Spain with deaths believed to be accidental, judicial officials have launched an investigation and are gathering testimonies and evidence to confirm the circumstances of the death. When contacted on Sunday, a spokesperson for the UK Foreign Office said: “We are supporting the family of a British national who has died in Spain, and are in touch with the local authorities.”",

    "title": "‘Unprecedented’ sightings of Asian hornets raise fears for UK bees",
    "article_text": "They have bright yellow legs, are about 25mm (almost 1in) long, and a single colony, if left unchecked, can “butcher” 90,000 pollinating insects in just one season. Since the first UK sighting in 2016 ofVespa velutina– theAsian or yellow-legged hornet– beekeepers and scientists have waged a vigorous campaign to minimise the damage this invasive species can do to Britain’s biodiversity and bee colonies. Last year, a wet spring and washout summer appeared to have hindered the insect’s population growth as the number of nests spotted in the UK dropped from 72 in 2023 to 24 in 2024. But it was also the first year that theNational Bee Unitreceived confirmation, via DNA, that the hornets had successfully bred and over-­wintered in the UK. Now experts fear the dry, sunny start to spring this year and the rapid spread of the species inEuropewill lead to a surge in this year’s numbers. “Unprecedented” early sightings of Asian hornets have been recorded inJersey, leading experts to suspect that record numbers could try to establish nests in the UK this year. “The first queens were more than two weeks early this year,” said John De Carteret, a founding member of the Jersey Asian Hornet Group, which has about 550 traps in place this year. “We’re obviously concerned.” There were 262 queen Asian hornets recorded on Jersey by 11 April,a year-on-year increase of 1,090%. “When we reach 266 queens, we will equal the total from 2024 – and that figure wasn’t reached until 25 June,” said De Carteret. Ian Campbell, of the British Beekeepers Association, said: “There’s a strong risk of this year’s numbers being at least as high as in 2023 and the potential to be even higher. It would be a surprise if numbers were not above the 2024 level.” The species is carnivorous, and a typical nest of between 2,000 and 3,000 Asian hornets can devour more than 11kg (about 24lb) of insects a season, according to Campbell – about the weight of 90,000 bees. The public is being urged to “be vigilant everywhere” and learn how to identify and report Asian hornets, which have yellow legs and a distinctive orange band on the fourth segment of their abdomens – alongside entirely black velvety thoraxes, which distinguish them from the native European hornet. Like bees, their stings can cause painful and potentially deadly allergic reactions. Any “sightings of concern” should be reported to the government’s National Bee Unit via theAsian Hornet Watch appor online, using the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (UKCEH)reporting tool. “Yellow-legged hornets cause significant damage to native pollinators, including our much-loved honeybees,” said Kate Wilson, head of the National Bee Unit. “Thanks to increasing reports to the app and online, it is not unexpected that sightings may occur earlier in the year. We encourage the public to remain vigilant and continue to report any potential sightings to us.” Such sightings can help people working to combat the spread of Asian hornets to understand the national picture. “I collected one from a lady in her 80s after she captured it in a yogurt tub, while the youngest person who reported one was eight,” De Carteret said. Ecology professor Helen Roy of UKCEH and Exeter University said the hornets pose “a major threat” to wildlife and biodiversity: “There isn’t a natural enemy that we’re aware of that could control the Asian hornet.” It is thought that successive generations of the offspring of a single mated queen, which was accidentally introducedto France in a container of Chinese crockeryin 2004, have now reached 15 European countries, including the UK. “In some countries like Spain and Belgium, we’ve seen numbers increase from a handful of nests to 10,000 nests in four years,” said Campbell. France is believed to have more than a half a million nests, which researchers believe could becosting the French economyan estimated €30.8m a year in lost bee colonies and honey revenue, while the invaders have reduced honey productionby 35% in Portugaland50% in Liguria, Italy,in recent years. In March, the first large-scale study of the Asian hornet’s diet, run by researchers at Exeter University,found 1,400 different species in their guts. Of the top 50 invertebrate prey species identified, 43 were known to visit flowers. These includedEurope’s three main crop pollinators: the European honeybee, the buff-tailed bumblebee and the red-tailed bumblebee. De Carteret, a retired police forensic officer, said hornets will typically “butcher” this prey by biting off their heads, wings, legs and abdomens so that their thoraxes – a source of protein – can be fed to the queen’s larvae. So far this year, there have been onlytwo confirmed sightingsof yellow-legged hornets in the UK, but “now is the time for people to be on the lookout”, Roy said. If the government had not destroyed the nests the public has been reporting since 2016,modelling by Exeter University suggeststhat the hornets would already be established in large areas of England and Wales, and entering Scotland. Campbell said it was important to try to take photos of suspected Asian hornets and their nests: last year, frommore than 29,000 reports, only about 70 were deemed accurate enough to beconfirmed sightings. “To be successful with eradication, the National Bee Unit needs to get every single nest,” he said. New hornet queens are constantly buzzing into the UK from Europe to replace those that have been eradicated. “The Asian hornet can arrive in a lot of different ways. It can come in on fresh produce or within someone’s car, across any Channel crossing,” Roy said. “Everyone needs to be vigilant, everywhere.”",

    "title": "Greenland documentary forces Danes to confront their colonial heritage",
    "article_text": "For two weeks in Denmark the subject of the documentary was “bigger than Trump”, says producer Michael Bévort. The broadcast ofGrønlands hvide guld(Greenland’s white gold), a 55-minute film about the Danish exploitation over several decades of a cryolite mine in southernGreenlandand the vast sums of money it generated, made waves in February in both Greenland and its former colonial ruler, Denmark. But the reaction between the two could not have been more polarised. In Greenland, which remains part of the Danish kingdom, with Denmark still controlling its foreign and defence policies, there were feelings of anger and deep sadness. The country was in the middle of an election being watched by the world thanks to Donald Trump’s threats to take control of the Arctic island. According to a poll for Greenlandic newspaperSermitsiaq, more than a third of voters said the documentary would influence their vote. There was also a sense of long-awaited recognition – that the stories people had heard from their friends and relatives about what happened in the now derelict town of Ivittuut were finally being confirmed by a public institution as big as DR, the public-service Danish Broadcasting Corporation. Politically, it was seen as seismic in the country’s capital, Nuuk. It had the potential, some believed, to change the power dynamic between the territory and the Nordic country, which has long been framed as Greenland being financially dependent onDenmark. “A new documentary film shows that Denmark has earned at least 400bn kroner [£46bn] from just one mine,” Greenland’s then-prime minister, Múte B Egede, said at the time. While there were initially some positive reviews in Denmark, the Danish media quickly flipped to attack, after one of the economists who appeared in the documentary denounced its interpretation of the figures. “It was horrible,” Bévort told theObserver. “It was the worst shit storm, almost ever.” Criticism of the documentary centred on the figure of 400bn Danish kroner, the amount the team calculated was Denmark’s gross income from the mine over 133years, adjusted to today’s value. But Torben M Andersen – an economics professor at Aarhus university and chair of the Greenland Economic Council, who appears in the documentary – put the figure into doubt by urging caution over the calculation, which he said referred to turnover between 1854 and 1987, not profit. The documentary is careful to emphasise that the figure – calculated using logbooks from the Danish national archives – refers to the overall turnover because, as they are advised when dealing with colonial economics, production costs were spent in Denmark using Danish workers and equipment. For 10 days, DR stood by the documentary. Despite criticism from several politicians, including the Danish Moderates’ culture minister, Jakob Engel-Schmidt, who decried its “poor journalistic craftmanship”, and economists, DR’s news director, Sandy French, refused to give in, saying: “There have been no violations of press ethics guidelines, there are no factual errors or reservations that have not been made”. But eventually they changed their minds. They announced that they would withdraw and “depublish” the documentary and that DR’s news editor-in-chief, Tholmas Falbe, was resigning. French said the turning point was new information about a graph of total accumulated sales of cryolite that had been removed from an earlier version of the documentary because it was not accurate. “It may seem like a minor thing compared to the big debate about the documentary, but this new discovery is crucial to me because you have to be able to trust that the presentation is accurate,” said French. Bévort, who is trying to find a new home for the documentary, said the rare move to depublish was political. “It’s nothing to do with the film. They’re going after DR.” Rune Lykkeberg, editor-in-chief of Danish newspaperInformation, agrees. “Not political in the sense ‘we need to censor this message to appease the government’. But corporately political in the sense that ‘we must do this to protect our brand and control the damage’.” He added: “DR is like the BBC, a public-service station whose ultimate executive is the government – the minister of culture appoints the head of its board who appoints the formally independent CEO of DR. He came out with heavy criticism of the documentary, which was also political overreach.” The move to depublish was a “terrible decision”, Lykkeberg added. “The documentary was part of public debate, it was a public fact that people were deliberating and it was in the common interest that everyone could access it. It does not help anyone that you can’t see the film you’re talking about. And the documentary is not dangerous.” Naaja Nathanielsen, who was a minister in the last Greenlandic government and in the current government, which was officially sworn in on Monday, said the move was “an overreaction” from DR. “It has more something to do with the Danish self-interpretation of their actions in Greenland more than what this movie is about,” she told theObserver. While she has not seen the numbers, so cannot comment on whether they are exactly correct, she believes they are fair. “What I do believe is that it’s not an unjust presentation of the economy between Greenland and Denmark,” she said. “I have confidence enough in the numbers to say they represent a correct interpretation of the way things were – even when Denmark started investing more in Greenland.” But to focus so much on the figures alone “derails” the conversation from what should be the real debate, she said. “In Greenland we can have both narratives … yes, there is something in the past with Denmark that has been awry, that was not right, that violated rights. And we can still accept and acknowledge all the good stuff Denmark has done as well. So for us both narratives can exist at the same time.” But in Denmark – or at least Danish media – she says, that seems not to be the case. “There is only one narrative that can exist, and that is that Denmark was good to Greenland and that’s the end of the story.” DR and the Danish minister for culture did not respond to theObserver’s request for comment.",

    "title": "Palestinian medic attacked in Gaza is being detained in Israel, says ICRC",
    "article_text": "A Palestinian paramedic who has been missing since a massacre of medics and rescue workers by Israeli troops in Gaza last month is being detained inIsrael, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The whereabouts of Assad al-Nsasrah, a Palestinian paramedic, had been unknown for weeks since an incident on 23 March when workers from the Palestinian Red Crescent (PRCS) and Palestinian civil defence came under fire as they drove ambulances to rescue injured colleagues in the southern city of Rafah. Fifteen Palestinian paramedics and rescue workers, including at least oneUnited Nationsemployee,were killed in the attack by Israeli troops. The UN has said they were deliberately shot “one by one” and the bodies, along with the rescue vehicles, were then buried with a bulldozer in a sandy pit, in what appears to have been an attempt to cover up the killings. Witnesses who uncovered the bodies said the workers were found still in their uniforms and some had their hands tied. The Red Crescent called the attack on its workers a “grave violation of international law” and has called for an international investigation. Nsasrah, 47, fromGaza, who had been working for Red Crescent for 16 years, was among the medics in the ambulances caught up in the ambush, and he had not been seen since. In an interview with the Guardian, another survivor, the Red Crescent volunteer Munther Abed, 27, said he had seen Nsasrah being taken away alive and blindfolded by Israeli officers at the scene of the killings. On Sunday, the ICRC said it had “received information that the PRCS medic Assad al-Nsasrah has been detained in an Israeli place of detention”. The ICRC spokesperson gave no further details on where Nsasrah was being held and confirmed that Israel had not granted access to visit him. “The ICRC has not been able to visit any Palestinian detainees held in Israeli places of detention since 7 October 2023,” said the spokesperson. “The ICRC continues to call for access to all places of detention and reiterates publicly and privately that all detainees must always be treated humanely and with dignity.” In a statement, PRCS called on the international community to demand the release of Nsasrah, a father of six, stating that he had been “forcibly abducted while carrying out his humanitarian duties”. There was no immediate comment from the Israel military. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have faced mounting pressure over inconsistencies in their account of the attack. They had initially claimed troops opened fire on vehicles that were “advancing suspiciously” without headlights or emergency signals. However, the IDFhad to backtrackafter mobile phone footage, from a medic who was among those killed at the scene, showed the ambulances – clearly marked with the Red Crescent logo – driving with flashing red emergency lights and headlights on their vehicles. Abed, the medic who survived the attack, described how he was held for several hours by Israeli forces after the ambulances came under fire. He said he was fully stripped, beaten again and interrogated about his past before he was finally released. The IDF said they were now re-examining “operational information” to understand why the initial account had been “mistaken”, and that an investigation was being carried out. They added that a preliminary inquiry had indicated “troops opened fire due to a perceived threat after a previous encounter in the area, and that six of the individuals killed in the incident were identified as Hamas terrorists”. However, none of those killed in the attack were armed and no proof has yet been presented that any of those killed were Hamas militants.",

    "title": "Airstrike destroys parts of Gaza City hospital as Israel intensifies offensive",
    "article_text": "An Israeli airstrike destroyed parts of a hospital in Gaza City early on Sunday, asIsraelcontinued its military offensive in the war-battered Palestinian territory and cut off access to the southern city of Rafah. The Palestinian civil defence agency said Israel’s air force fired missiles at al-Ahli hospital at around 2am. It was the only hospital still fully functioning inGazaCity after the destruction of medical facilities in the northern area of the strip. The agency said the bombing “led to the destruction of the surgery building and the oxygen generation station for the intensive care units”. There were no reports of casualties but the Gaza health ministry said one child died during the rushed evacuation as doctors were unable to provide urgent care. The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, was among those who condemned the strike, calling it “deplorable”. “Israel’s attacks on medical facilities have comprehensively degraded access to healthcare in Gaza,” Lammy said. Hospitals, which are protected under international humanitarian law, have repeatedly been hit by Israeli strikes in the Gaza Strip since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas on 7 October 2023. The Israeli military has accused Hamas of embedding military operations in hospitals and civilian buildings, which the group has denied. Al-Ahli hospital is run by the Anglican church in Jerusalem. In a statement, the episcopal diocese of Jerusalem said it was appalled at the airstrike, and said it was the fifth time the hospital had been targeted. In a statement confirming the strike, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) alleged the hospital was a command and control centre used by Hamas. “The compound was used by Hamas terrorists to plan and execute terror attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF troops,” the military said. In a statement in response, Hamas denied the allegations, calling them lies by the IDF “to “justify its savage crimes”. According to witnesses, doctors and patients were given less than 20 minutes’ warning to evacuate the building before the strike. Video footage circulating online appeared to show people fleeing the building as it was engulfed in smoke and flames. The IDF said it had taken steps to “mitigate harm to civilians” and issued “advance warnings”. Dr Moataz Harara, the head of the hospital’s emergency department, said of the evacuation: “The scene was heartbreaking and painful. You could see patients walking out on foot or being carried on beds, all of them filled with terror and fear etched on their faces. Women and children were screaming and crying.” Harara said the hospital had previously been treating between 300 and 500 patients a day, on top of 120 inpatients. But he confirmed Sunday’s attack had left the hospital with a “complete inability to operate” and meant it could no longer accept any new patients. The radiology room and laboratories had also been devastated, he added. Harara said growing numbers in Gaza were facing a “humanitarian disaster and famine” at the same time as medical facilities were coming under attack. Since the breakdown of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in March, Gaza’s health sector has been further crippled by a blockade on humanitarian aid, including medical supplies, by the Israeli government. It has left people facing acute shortages of food, water and medicines, a tactic that rights groups say amounts to a war crime. Israel maintains that enough essential medical supplies have entered Gaza. Across the strip, Israel continued to escalate its military offensive and vowed to seize large parts of Gaza to put pressure on Hamas to release the remaining hostages and accept new ceasefire terms. The Gaza health ministry said that 35 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes across Gaza on Sunday. On Saturday, Israel said it had completed its takeover of a new “security zone” that cut off the southern city of Rafah from the rest of Gaza, part of a wider Israeli operation to establish and expand a security buffer zone across southernmost Gaza where Palestinians are banned from entering. The defence minister, Israel Katz, announced that Israel’s military had seized the corridor between Rafah and Khan Younis, which he referred to as the “Morag axis”, giving Israel effective control of the area stretching from the Egyptian border to Rafah. Evacuation orders were also given for several neighbourhoods in Khan Younis on Saturday night. The prewar population of Rafah was about 275,000, which earlier this year expanded to an estimated 1.4 million as Palestinians were displaced from north and central Gaza by Israeli security operations. But last week Israel once again issued sweeping evacuation orders for all those staying in Rafah, displacing swathes of Gaza’s population of 2 million people. In the last three weeks alone, dozens of evacuation orders have been issued and 400,000 Palestinians told to move, according to the UN. On Friday, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said more than two-thirds of Gaza was either under active displacement orders or designated as “no-go” zones, where humanitarian groups cannot operate freely. The areas of Gaza that remain habitable continue to shrink and most people are living packed together in squalid tents or the rubble of their homes. The establishment of Israeli control over crucial corridors in the south and northern areas of Gaza, as well as the expanding security buffer zone, means Israel now controls more than 50% of the strip. Katz vowed to continue to expand operations “vigorously” across the rest of Gaza. “IDF activity will soon expand strongly to additional locations throughout most of Gaza and you will have to evacuate the fighting zones,” he said. The statement by Katz urged Palestinians to stand up and remove Hamas and release the remaining hostages, saying: “This is the only way to stop the war.” There was no immediate Hamas response. Since theHamas-led attack on 7 October 2023on southern Israel, which killed about 1,200 people, Israel’s retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 50,000 people, most of them civilians, according to the territory’s health ministry.",

    "title": "Labour MPs push for Foreign Office to recognise Palestinian statehood",
    "article_text": "The Foreign Office is under pressure fromLabourMPs to recognise a Palestinian state if Emmanuel Macron, the French president, presses ahead with plans to recognise Palestine at an international conference set for June. France is co-chairing the conference at the UN in New York alongside Saudi Arabia, and Macron has said the conference must be a decisive moment. Emily Thornberry, the chair of the foreign affairs select committee, said the time was coming for the UK to recognise Palestinian statehood, adding: “We need to do it with friends. We need to do it with the French. There are a lot of other countries sitting back and waiting.” She said that if the west did not act soon, there would be no Palestine left to recognise. Chris Doyle, the chair of the Council on Arab-British Understanding (CAABU), also backed the measure, saying it should have been done long ago and that such a step by two permanent members of the UN security council would send a powerful message. He also said that if the UK did not take this step soon it may be too late sinceIsraelwas clearly intent on pressing ahead with the effective annexation of the West Bank. The CAABU has a strong following among Labour MPs, many of whom are furious with Israel’s behaviour in Gaza. There is also anger that two Labour MPs werebanned by Israelfrom visiting the West Bank last week. The Foreign Office’s formal position is to say it will recognise Palestine at an appropriate moment of maximum impact, but when David Cameron was foreign secretary hemarginally advanced the UK policyby affirming that recognition need not come at the end of a process that leads to a two-state solution. In a reference to Israel, he said no state could have a veto over a UK decision to recognise Palestine. Macron surprised observers last week when he announced he hoped the June conference would act as a trigger for a group of nations to recognise Palestinian statehood, remarks that put clear diplomatic pressure on the UK to follow the French initiative. He told France 5: “We must move toward recognition [of the Palestinian state] and so, in the coming months, we will.” He added in a reference to some Gulf states including Saudi Arabia: “I also want to participate in a collective dynamic, which must allow all those who defend Palestine to recognise Israel in turn, which many of them do not do.” The Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman – who has personally accused Israel of genocide against the Palestinians – has said Saudi Arabia will only recognise Israel as part of a pact that includes an irreversible path to a Palestinian state. Although there is scepticism in some British quarters as to how far Macron is prepared to antagonise Israel, personal and political relations between Keir Starmer and Macron are strong. It will be hard for the Foreign Office to resist a strong French push for Palestine’s recognition, especially if it is seen as part of a European-Gulf peace push. In May last year France chose not to joinSpain, Ireland and Norwayin recognising Palestine following an overwhelming vote in favour by the UN general assembly. At present 148 of the 193 member countries of the UN have officially recognised Palestinian statehood. So far no western G20 country, including Canada, Italy or Germany, has taken the step. The Knesset voted heavily last month against a two-state solution, but the leader of the Israeli opposition, Yair Lapid, still sees a medium-term pathway to it so long as Hamas is not part of any Palestinian government. European recognition would infuriate the US and Israel, but the French argue an alliance with Gulf states may prompt the Trump administration to recalibrate its support for Benjamin Netanyahu. Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, said on social media: “Unilateral recognition of a fictional Palestinian state … is a reward for terror and a boost to Hamas.” Faced by the backlash, Macron, writing in Hebrew on the social media site X, claimed he was the victim of a host of unfounded interpretations. He said France’s position was “yes to peace. Yes to Israel’s security. Yes to a Palestinian state without Hamas.” He wrote: “This requires the release of all hostages, a sustainable ceasefire, the immediate resumption of humanitarian assistance, and the promotion of a two-state political solution. There is no other way but a political solution. I stand for the Palestinians’ legal right to a state and peace, just as I stand for the Israelis’ right to live in peace and security, and while both states are recognised by their neighbours. “The two-state solution conference in June must be decisive. I am doing everything I can, alongside our partners, to achieve this goal of peace. We need it so much.” In a sign of the US’s apparent willingness to tolerate the annexation of the West Bank, the US Senate, voting largely along party lines last week, confirmed Mike Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor, as US ambassador to Israel. Huckabee has referred to the West Bankby its Jewish biblical namesJudea and Samaria. At his confirmation hearing he claimed Donald Trump did not support the enforced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza.",

    "article_text": "An arrest warrant for the former City minister Tulip Siddiq has been issued in Bangladesh with a new allegation accusing her of illegally receiving a plot of land from her aunt, theoustedformer prime minister Sheikh Hasina. Bangladeshi media reported the warrant was issued by a judge for 53 people connected to Hasina, including Siddiq. There is no formal extradition treaty between the UK andBangladesh. Siddiq’s representative said there was “no basis at all for any charges to be made against her, and there is absolutely no truth in any allegation that she received a plot of land in Dhaka through illegal means”. The MP for Hampstead and Highgate has deniedallegations of corruptionlinked to her aunt’s collapsed regime and accused the Bangladeshi authorities of a “targeted and baseless” campaign against her. Siddiqresigned in Januaryas economic secretary to the Treasury, citing the risk of becoming a distraction and saying the government was being harmed by the furore over her use of properties given to herself and her family by allies of the regime of Hasina. She was not deemed by Keir Starmer’s ethics adviser to have broken any rules over her use of the homes and he found no evidence to suggest that any of Siddiq’s assets were derived from anything other than legitimate means. But Laurie Magnus did find a lack of records and said lapse of time meant he had “not been able to obtain comprehensive comfort in relation to all the UK property-related matters”. A Conservative party spokesperson said: “If it is the case that Keir Starmer’schoice for anti-corruption ministeris the subject of an international arrest warrant for corruption, she should immediately stand down as Labour MP. “It is shocking that Keir Starmer believes ‘the door remains open’ for Ms Siddiq returning to a government position. Keir Starmer must put his close friendship and association with Ms Siddiq aside and take the action he should have months ago.” Bangladesh’s anti-corruption commission (ACC) has alleged that Siddiq, 42, received a 670 sq metre plot in the diplomatic zone of the capital, Dhaka, through ties to the former rulers, according to theSunday Telegraph. The allegation is that Siddiq persuaded her aunt to allocate three plots of land in the exclusive enclave for her family members, including her mother, Sheikh Rehana, her brother Radwan and her younger sister Azmina. The family are all based in Britain. The ACC chair, Mohammad Abdul Momen, previously told the BBC the investigations in Bangladesh were “based on documentary evidence of corruption” and Siddiq should return to fight her case in Bangladesh. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion In a statement made through her lawyers, Siddiq’s representatives said: “The ACC has made various allegations against Ms Siddiq through the media in the last few months. The allegations are completely false and have been dealt with in writing by Ms Siddiq’s lawyers. “The ACC has not responded to Ms Siddiq or put any allegations to her directly or through her lawyers. Ms Siddiq knows nothing about a hearing in Dhaka relating to her and she has no knowledge of any arrest warrant that is said to have been issued. “To be clear, there is no basis at all for any charges to be made against her, and there is absolutely no truth in any allegation that she received a plot of land in Dhaka through illegal means. “She has never had a plot of land in Bangladesh and she has never influenced any allocation of plots of land to her family members or anyone else. “No evidence has been provided by the ACC to support this or any other allegation made against Ms Siddiq and it is clear to us that the charges are politically motivated.”",

    "article_text": "The Hollywood actorMickey Rourkehas been kicked out of the Celebrity Big Brother house over “instances of unacceptable behaviour” and “inappropriate language”. The 72-year-old Bafta winner is understood to have used behaviour and language that was considered to be threatening and aggressive during a task, directed towards his housemate Chris Hughes, a former Love Island contestant. No physical altercation took place, according to the PA news agency. Rourke had received a formal warning fromBig Brotherearlier in the week for “unacceptable language and behaviour” directed at another housemate, JoJo Siwa. The 21-year-old US singer accused Rourke of being homophobic after he made comments about her sexuality and said he would “vote the lesbian out real quick”. The Oscar-nominated actor had also asked Siwa if she “likes girls or boys”, and when she replied that she liked girls and her partner was non-binary, he said: “If I stay longer than four days, you won’t be gay any more.” She responded: “I can guarantee I’ll still be gay and I’ll still be in a very happy relationship.” Hughes, who has presented sports coverage for the BBC and ITV, told Rourke “you can’t say that” after theformer boxersaid he needed “a fag” and gestured to Siwa to add: “I’m not talking to you.” Hughes, 32, comforted Siwa in Wednesday’s episode after the comments. In the diary room, Rourke was given a formal warning and Big Brother said: “Further language or behaviour of this nature could lead to you being removed from the Big Brother house.” Rourke then apologised to Siwa, saying: “I want to apologise. I’ve got a habit of having a short fuse, and I don’t mean nothing by it.” Sunday’s episode showed the events that led to his departure. Rourke had earlier told Big Brother in the diary room that his housemates “seemed happy” that he had not left during Friday’s eviction episode. “They seemed happy, for some reason. I did my hardest to get out of here. You know, I always went against the machine, and I don’t want to go through life, like, with a clenched fist any more,” he said. “I spent my whole life like this, and it gets hard. It wears you out.” A spokesperson for the ITV show said on Saturday: “Mickey Rourke has agreed to leave the Celebrity Big Brother house this evening following a discussion with Big Brother regarding further use of inappropriate language and instances of unacceptable behaviour.” Rourke won the leading actor Bafta and Golden Globe in 2009 for his role playing retired professional wrestler Randy “The Ram” Robinson in The Wrestler.",

    "title": "British Steel to deploy emergency measures to save Scunthorpe furnaces",
    "article_text": "British Steel is to deploy emergency measures in a race against time to save the blast furnaces at Scunthorpe, as the business secretary refused to guarantee the plant could get what it needed in time. The company is understood to be looking at offers of help from more than a dozen businesses to obtain materials such as iron ore and coking coal, potentially allowing it to avoid the temporary shutdown of one of the two furnaces. On Saturday, parliamentpassed a one-day billcontaining emergency powers to gain control of the Scunthorpe site after its Chinese owner, Jingye, declined government support to keep the plant running over the next few weeks. British Steel’s UK management team is now scrambling to buy the materials, with help from government officials. The business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, declined to directly accuse Jingye of sabotaging the plant but it is understood ministers do not expect the company to return to any negotiations. Reynolds said theemergency government steel actionmeant there was now a “high trust bar” for Chinese companies to invest in critical UK industries. “It might not be sabotage, it might be neglect,” Reynolds told the BBC on Sunday. “The conscious decision not just to not order raw materials but to sell existing supplies of raw materials is the significant change that required the government to step in.” Reynolds said there would not be a full ban on Chinese investment in UK industry, with MPs raising questions about whether companies would be allowed to invest in a planned new nuclear site. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has been on a charm offensive with Beijing to try to attract investment. But on Sunday the Guardian revealed the government could target parts of China’s security apparatus under new foreign influence rules set to be unveiled in the coming months. China as a whole is not expected to be included on the enhanced tier of the foreign influence registration scheme (Firs). Reynolds said the costs to the economy of closing the plant and losing the country’s steelmaking capacity – plus the major job losses it entailed – would have been at least £1bn, more than the losses expected from nationalising the plant. A decision on full nationalisation is expected to be taken in the next fortnight if the plant can continue operation. Reynolds told the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg he would not “make my situation or the nation’s situation more difficult” by giving more details on whether the steel blast furnaces would be able to continue operating. If the furnaces run out of raw materials, they could go through an uncontrolled cooling, making it prohibitively expensive to restart production. The government said Tata Steel and Rainham Steel had offered “managerial support and raw materials” to British Steel. Last week Jingye ordered British Steel to temporarily shut down one blast furnace on Monday in order to eke out remaining materials. However, the process – known as a salamander tap – is complicated and is generally avoided unless repairs are needed. British Steel managers are now looking at whether this can be avoided. While some materials at Immingham port on the Humber estuary inLincolnshireare awaiting payment, British Steel is trying to find materials for the coming weeks, with some shipments taking as long as 45 days to arrive. Reynolds said the UK had “given ourselves the opportunity, we are in control of the site, my officials are on site right now to give us a chance to do that”. But he said it was too commercially sensitive to confirm either way whether the government could guarantee the plant would continue operating. Jingye, which bought British Steel in 2019 – when Boris Johnson was prime minister – had stopped ordering more raw materials and begun selling off the supplies it already had, declining an offer of £500m in support and refusing to guarantee the furnaces could continue operating. “It became clear to me and to the government, no financial offer of any generosity would have been accepted,” Reynolds said. “This was the situation on [Thursday] the 10th of April, on the Friday we had agreement from the cabinet. On Saturday, parliament was recalled, and here we are.” Officials from the Department for Business and Trade arrived at the Scunthorpe plant as soon as the legislation came into force on Saturday, the government said on Sunday. The business secretary told Sky News there was now a “high trust bar” for bringing Chinese investment into the UK and said he would not have allowed a Chinese company to invest in the “sensitive” steel sector. Reynolds said the company had annual losses of £233m and that figure “can be improved upon”. But he said the cost of nationalisation had to be compared with the cost of allowing the plant to go under. He said it would not mean any further borrowing to nationalise the plant. “We’ve got an allocation in the first budget for a steel fund of over £2.5bn. “If we are spending some of that money to support, in the short term, steel, I think that’s better for the taxpayer than spending a greater sum of money on a transition with a company I’m not sure right now I could rely on, or to be frank … the complete collapse of British Steel, with a cost to the exchequer of many multiples [of that]. “If that had gone down, that number of jobs, the land remediation, support to those who lost their jobs, that would be well over £1bn.” Reynolds said he would not make accusations of Chinese state interference, but said the company was “not [acting] in the kind of rational way we’d expect a company to operate in a market economy”. The Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, accused Jingye of lying about the company’s accounts and said he was “100% certain” the Chinese government had ordered Jingye to buy British Steel in order to close the business. Farage offered no evidence for those accusations and said it was based on his “intuition”. “Why do you think that yesterday morning the trade unions acted to stop the Chinese officials even getting their cars into the plant? Because they feared industrial sabotage,” Farage said. The GMB trade union general secretary, Gary Smith, confirmed workers had acted to stop the company gaining access. “We were worried about industrial vandalism and there was a worry about sabotage on the site, quite frankly,” he said. “And yesterday, workers did prevent executives from the Chinese owners from going on site. “I’m sure that people are still very worried about that, but these people performed heroics yesterday to ensure that we’ve got a fighting chance for the steel industry in this country. They were legitimately concerned about industrial sabotage.”",

    "title": "UK drivers face ‘hat-trick of hold-ups’ over Easter bank holiday weekend",
    "article_text": "Drivers heading off for Easter getaways face a “hat-trick of hold-ups” as the four-day weekend coincides with the end of the holidays for many schools. Traffic will be “equally severe”, the RAC said, on Thursday, Good Friday and Saturday, with an estimated 2.7 million leisure trips by car planned across the UK each day. More than 19m leisure journeys are planned between Thursday and Easter Monday, including 6.2m that drivers intend to make during the period but are unsure on what day. The Easter weekend is three weeks later than in 2024, which the AA said on Friday would “bump up bank holiday traffic by 15%” as many people hope for warmer weather. Delays of more than an hour are expected on Thursday on the 35-mile stretch of the M25 from junction 7 for Gatwick airport to junction 16 for the M40, the transport analytics company Inrix said. It also highlighted the M6 north of Chester and the M25 clockwise towards Godstone, Surrey, as likely traffic hotspots that day. On Good Friday, the lengthiest hold-ups are expected to be between 11am and 1pm. Drivers using two popular routes to the south west – the A303 in Wiltshire and the M5 southbound from Bristol – are being warned of long queues, particularly during that period. The RAC’s breakdown spokesperson Alice Simpson urged drivers to expect “extremely high levels of traffic” from Thursday onwards. She said: “The late bank holiday weekend clashes with the end of the Easter break for many schools, which we think will change the nature of this year’s getaway. “Although journey numbers are still very high, we’re anticipating more day trips and weekend breaks than people heading off on one and two-week stints. This could lead to a hat-trick of hold-ups on Thursday, Friday and Saturday as drivers visit family and friends. “Drivers shouldn’t expect to escape the queues if they don’t plan the best time to set off. It’s always best to travel as early as possible in the morning or later in the day when most of the traffic has eased, especially if headed to popular holiday destinations such as the West Country, Scotland or Wales.” The Port of Dover said it expected to process about 5,500 cars embarking on outbound ferry sailings between 6am and 1pm on Good Friday. The traffic management system Operation Brock, which involves narrow lanes and a reduced 50mph speed limit, will be in place in Kent until 22 April. It is designed to manage traffic flows on the M20, with lorries heading for the Port of Dover or Eurotunnel directed to a specific lane. On the railways, Network Rail is conducting engineering work in several locations this weekend, causing disruption to a number of routes. The most significant impact will be at London Euston, where there will be no services to or from Milton Keynes on Easter Saturday and Easter Sunday, and a reduced timetable on Good Friday and Easter Monday.

    "title": "Melanoma patients in England get fast-track access to cancer vaccine",
    "article_text": "Patients with an advanced type of skin melanoma in England will be given fast-track access to a“revolutionary”new cancer vaccine as part of an NHS trial. The vaccine, known as iSCIB1+ (ImmunoBody), helps the immune system recognise cancer cells and therefore better respond to immunotherapy treatment. The trial is part of the expansion of NHS England’s Cancer Vaccine Launch Pad (CVLP), a programme to fast-track eligible patients to studies developing vaccines at their nearest participating hospital. The CVLP has already helped thousands ofNHSpatients access trials of a personalised vaccine against bowel cancer, with more than 350 people fast-tracked for consideration, and has now expanded to include a trial for melanoma. It aims to provide 10,000 patients in England with personalised cancer treatments in the UK by 2030. The NHS partnered with the life-sciences company Scancell to widen access for patients at hospitals across the country, with seven sites initially registered and the first patients expected to be referred next month. Melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in the UK, accounting for about 4% of all new cases. Prof Peter Johnson, the NHS national cancer director, said: “Skin cancer can have a devastating impact and we know that cancer vaccines have the potential to revolutionise cancer care for patients in this country and across the world – and to save more lives. “It’s incredibly exciting that the NHS is expanding its world-leading programme so more patients with different types of cancer could benefit from the development ofnew vaccinesthat could stop their cancer coming back. “We want to ensure as many eligible NHS patients as possible have access to these vital trials, which is why we are working with a range of industry partners as more studies get up and running to ensure patients are fast-tracked to a vaccine that could transform lives.” The prime minister, Keir Starmer, said:“This kind of innovation is nothing short of life-saving and I want to see more of these world-leading treatments being developed in the UK. That’s why through our plan for change we’ve taken action to boost our life-sciences sector through steps to fast-track clinical trials and cut red tape for researchers – so that Britain is the best country in the world for medical research. “This will accelerate the discovery of transformative treatments and improve services for patients, driving growth across the country while making sure as many people as possible can benefit from cutting-edge treatments.” Susanna Daniels, the chief executive of Melanoma Focus, said: “Melanoma skin cancer can be deadly and it’s sadly on the rise in the UK. As well as continuing to call for urgent action on prevention, we’re delighted to see progress in innovative treatments and very much welcome the expansion of this vaccine trial. “The use of vaccines to treat melanoma is an exciting development and we will be encouraging eligible patients to take part in these groundbreaking trials with our up-to-date Melanoma TrialFinder so that vaccines can be understood and patients can locate trial centres to discuss with their medical teams.”",

    "article_text": "Office-based military specialists have been called in to deal with the mounting piles of rubbish on the streets ofBirminghamafter a month-long strike by refuse workers. Tens of thousands of tonnes of rubbish have gone uncollected and Birmingham city council has declared a major incident and issued apublic health warningsince the all-out-strike by Unite union members began on 11 March. The council had already appealed to neighbouring authorities for assistance but the government has now asked for help from the British army in tackling the crisis. This will involve some of the military’s office-based planners being called in to provide logistical and administrative assistance for a short period. It will not involve deployed soldiers collecting bins. A government spokesperson said: “The government has already provided a number of staff to support the council with logistics and make sure the response on the ground is swift to address the associated public health risks. “In light of the ongoing public health risk, a small number of office-based military personnel with operational planning expertise have been made available to Birmingham city council to further support in this area. “This builds on a range of measures we’ve supported the council on to date – including neighbouring authorities providing additional vehicles and crews, and opening household waste centres to Birmingham residents.” More than 17,000 tonnes of rubbish has piled up in the streets since the industrial action started intermittently in January and progressed to an all-out strike in March. The dispute is over plans to scrap the higher-paid waste recycling and collection officer role from council fleets, which the council claims risks creating a “huge future equal-pay liability”. Last week Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, urged members of the Unite union to accept an “improved” deal, while the health secretary, Wes Streeting, said the strike had “escalated way out of hand”. The union’s general secretary, Sharon Graham, has condemned the “constant attacks and briefings against these low-paid bin workers”, claiming that the long-running dispute was adding further strains between the Labour party and Unite. “It is important to reiterate the truth, as opposed to the lies being peddled in an attempt to distract,” she said. “This dispute is not about greed or increased pay. This dispute is about workers losing up to £8,000 of their pay – which for some is almost a quarter.” Graham added that a partial deal on pay protection for some workers had already been agreed and urged the council to accept a wider offer the union had put forward. The council says only 17 workers will be affected, and they stand to lose much less than Unite has claimed. A further ballot on a deal to end the strike is expected to take place on Monday.",

    "article_text": "Jean Marsh, the actor and writer best known for co-creating and starring in the 1970s TV show Upstairs, Downstairs, has died aged 90. The film-maker Michael Lindsay-Hogg, who was a close friend of Marsh, said she died of complications with dementia in her London home on Sunday. “Jean died peacefully in bed looked after by one of her very loving carers,” he said. “You could say we were very close for 60 years. She was as wise and funny as anyone I ever met, as well as being very pretty and kind, and talented as both an actress and writer. “An instinctively empathetic person who was loved by everyone who met her. We spoke on the phone almost every day for the past 40 years.” Upstairs, Downstairs, covering class relations in Edwardian England, ran for five series from 1971 to 1975 in the UK and was also screened in the US. It won seven Emmy awards and a Peabody award, and Marsh won the Emmy for outstanding lead actress in a drama series in 1975 for her portrayal of Rose, the head parlour maid of the elegant Bellamy family that the show centred on. Marsh also co-created The House of Eliott and appeared in films such as Cleopatra in 1963, Frenzy in 1972, The Eagle Has Landed in 1976, The Changeling in 1980, Return to Oz in 1985, Willow in 1988, Fatherland in 1994 and Monarch in 2000. She became known for her appearances in the Doctor Who universe, including Joan of England in The Crusade, then as Sara Kingdom, a companion of the First Doctor. She later portrayed a villain opposite the Seventh Doctor. Marsh was awarded an OBE in 2012 for services to drama. The actor was born as Lyndsay Torren Marsh on 1 July 1934. She was six when the blitz began, and at seven she started ballet classes and took an interest in the performing arts. Rather than pursuing a traditional career, Marsh went to theatre school – which her parents considered a practical move, according tothe New York Times. In 1972, she told the Guardian: “If you were very working class in those days, you weren’t going to think of a career in science. You either did a tap dance or you worked in Woolworths.” Marsh came up with the idea for Upstairs, Downstairs with her friend the actor Eileen Atkins when the pair were house-sitting at a wealthy friend’s house in the south of France. After explaining that she wished she lived in luxury more often, Marsh got the idea to create a show that explored class relationships within household dynamics.",

    "article_text": "Pete Marocco, theTrump administrationofficial who played a major role in dismantling the US Agency for International Development (USAID), has left the state department, a US official said on Sunday. Donald Trump’s administration has moved tofire nearly all USAID staff, as billionaireElon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” has slashed funding and dismissed contractors across the federal bureaucracy in what it calls an attack on wasteful spending. “Pete was brought to state with a big mission – to conduct an exhaustive review of every dollar spent on foreign assistance. He conducted that historic task and exposed egregious abuses of taxpayer dollars,” a senior administration official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. “We all expect big things are in store for Pete on his next mission,” the official added. Sources told Reuters that Marocco, who was the director of foreign assistance at the state department, may have been pushed out but they declined to give further explanation. As recently as Thursday, he held a “listening session” at the state department with nearly two dozen experts to discuss the future of foreign assistance and seek input, according to a source familiar with the event and an invitation to the session seen by Reuters. When he returned to the state department less than a month ago, he said in an internal email: “I am going to return to my post as the Director of Foreign Assistance to bring value back to the American people.” Trump has claimed without evidence thatUSAIDwas rife with fraud and run by “radical left lunatics”, while Musk falsely accused it of being a “criminal” organization. Trump’s administration on Tuesday moved to reinstate at least six recently canceled US foreign aid programs for emergency food assistance. The quick reversal of decisions made just days ago underscored the rapid-fire nature of Trump’s cuts to foreign aid. That has led to programs being cut, restored then cut again, disrupting international humanitarian operations.",

    "title": "Hedge fund billionaire says US may face ‘worse than a recession’ from Trump tariffs",
    "article_text": "Billionaire investor Ray Dalio said that he is worried the US will experience “something worse than a recession” as a result ofDonald Trump’s trade policies. Speaking toNBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday, the 75-year-old hedge fund manager said: “I think that right now we are at a decision-making point and very close to a recession. And I’m worried about something worse than a recession if this isn’t handled well.” He went on to add: “A recession is two negative quarters of GDP and whether it goes slightly there. We always have those things. We have something that’s much more profound. We have a breaking down of the monetary order. We are going to change the monetary order because we cannot spend the amounts of money.” Dalio’s comments come in response to a tumultuous week across the global stock markets following the US president’stariffspolicies thatincludea 145% tariff raise on China. The billionaire also said there are “profound changes in our domestic order … and world order”, comparing current times with the 1930s. “I’ve studied history and this repeats over and over again. So if you take tariffs, if you take debt, if you take the rising power challenging existing power, if you take those factors and look at the factors, those changes in the orders, the systems, are very, very disruptive. How that’s handled could produce something that is much worse than a recession. Or it could be handled well,” he said. Dalio, who correctly predicted the 2008 recession, also said the current economic state of the US is “at a juncture”. “Let’s take the budget. If the budget deficit can be reduced to 3% of GDP, it will be about 7% if things are not changed. If it could be reduced to about 3% of GDP, and these trade deficits and so on are managed in the right way, this could all be managed very well,” he said. He went on to urge congressional members to take what he calls the “3% pledge”, adding that if they don’t, there will be a supply and demand problem for debt with results that will be “worse than a normal recession.” Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion In response to whether he believes Trump’s tariffs are worsening the “complicated mix of challenges” the world is facing, Dalio said there is a reality to build manufacturing and expand jobs across the US. However, he added that how that is done, “whether that’s done in a practical way, whether that’s done in a stable way”, or in a way with “quality negotiations” versus a “chaotic and disruptive way … makes all the difference in the world”. Despite Trump’s freezing of tariffs at 10% on all US imports except Chinese imports for 90 days, financial experts havewarnedthat the “damage has been done,” particularly in regards to what many are calling a “rapid de-dollarisation”.",

    "article_text": "A house explosion in Austin,Texas, destroyed the residence and damaged 24 nearby properties, injuring six people – including two firefighters. Around 11.25am CDT, residents across Austin reported hearingaboom and feeling an explosion in the area. “It rattled my windows and building,” one personposted on social mediawith an image of a plume of smoke rising into the air. Residents as far away as Georgetown – about 28 miles to the north – reported hearing the explosion. Austin fire department hasconfirmedthat six people – including two firefighter – were injured in the blast, which collapsed the house. Two of the injured were from the house, said Shannon Koesterer, spokesperson for Austin-Travis county EMS. One was in critical condition and the other in serious condition. Koesterer said a person in a nearby home was one of the injured and is listed in critical condition as well. Power was out for a time in the surrounding area but has been restored, said Thayer Smith, assistant chief of the Austin fire department. “We’re going to be here for hours,” Smith said on Sunday afternoon. “The main street will probably be opened, you know, probably within the next hour, but this street will be closed for the rest of the day.” Emergency officials were investigating the source but say they think the explosion that caused the house to collapse was caused by a gas explosion, possibly propane, KVUE news reported. The Texas Gas Service confirmed the house did not have natural gas service. Carol Hassell, who lives in the neighborhood, spoke with CBSAustin and said she heard a “loud boom” when the explosion happened. “I thought maybe a branch had fallen down on my roof,” Carol Hassell said. “I went out in the backyard, and the back door had been blown open, and I didn’t see anything on the house. I came out to the front, and then I realized all my windows had been blown out and the front door, and there’s extensive damage to some of the ceilings.” Hassell, who was preparing to list her home for sale later this month, said her garage doors were blown in, as well as the deadbolts on her locks. “I’m just glad I’m OK,” she said.",

    "article_text": "Police say a person is in custody after a suspected arson fire at the Pennsylvania governor’s mansionwhereJosh Shapiroand his family were evacuated after someone set fire to the building. No one was injured in the blaze and the fire was extinguished, authorities said. Pennsylvania state police Col. Christopher Paris identified the man in custody as Cody Balmer, 38, of Harrisburg. Paris emphasized at a Sunday afternoon news conference that the investigation is continuing. Francis Chardo, the Dauphin county district attorney, said that forthcoming charges will include attempted murder, terrorism, attempted arson and aggravated assault. Authorities said the suspect hopped over a fence surrounding the property and forcibly entered the residence before setting it on fire. The fire broke out overnight on the first night of the Jewish holiday of Passover, which Shapiro and his family had celebrated at the governor’s official residence in the state capital of Harrisburg. State police said in a statement that, while the investigation was ongoing, they were “prepared to say at this time that this was an act of arson”. In a statement, Shapiro, viewed as a potential White House contender for the Democratic party in 2028, said he and his family woke up at about 2am to bangs on the door from the Pennsylvania state police after the fire broke out. The Harrisburg bureau of fire was called to the residence and, while they worked to put out the fire, police evacuated Shapiro and his family from the residence safely, the governor said. Authorities said the fire caused a “significant amount of damage” to a portion of the residence before the blaze was extinguished. “Thank God no one was injured and the fire was extinguished,” Shapiro said in a statement. Shapiro and his family had been in a different part of the residence, police said. There was a police presence on Sunday as yellow tape cordoned off an alleyway, investigators observed the damage inside and an officer led a dog outside an iron security fence before investigators sawed off a section from the top of the security fence on the residence’s south side. They wrapped it in heavy black plastic and took it away in a vehicle. Shapiro splits his time between the mansion that has housed governors since it was built in the 1960s and a home in Abington, about 100 miles (160km) east. He posted a photograph on social media on Saturday of the family’s Passover Seder table at the residence. Republican Mark Schweiker, the former Pennsylvania governor, called the attack a “despicable act of cowardice” and said he hoped Pennsylvanians joined he and his wife in keeping the Shapiros in their prayers. Republican Tom Ridge, another former governor, said images of the damage to the residence where he lived for eight years with his family were “heartbreaking” and said the attack on the official residence was shocking. “Whoever is responsible for this attack – to both the Shapiro family and our Commonwealth – must be held to account,” Ridge said. State police said they were leading a multiagency investigation into the fire.",

    "title": "US stock markets expected to recover after Trump drops tariffs on mobiles",
    "article_text": "US stock markets were expected to stage a recovery on Monday afterDonald Trumpexcluded imports of smartphones and laptops from his tariff regime late on Friday night. Shares inAppleand chip maker Nvidia were on course to soar after tariffs on their products imported into the US were lifted for 90 days. The temporary reprieve was widely seen as a climbdown after pressure from Republican leaders concerned that the soaring cost of smartphones would spark a voter backlash. US retailers import about 80% of all smartphones, many of them fromChina, which Trump has slapped with tariffs totalling 145%. US Customs and Border Protection said items like laptops, hard drives, smartphones, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Vital machines made outside the US that are used to make semiconductors were also excluded. It means these products will avoid the China tariff and the 10% baseline tariffs applied on other countries caught by the new regime. Speaking on Air Force One on Saturday evening, Trump said he would be more specific about the latest exemption rules on Monday. “We’ve been making a lot of money,” he said. “It’s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.” It is not clear how long the exemption will last or whether separate tariffs will be negotiated on the specific products. China has responded with a tariff on allUS exports of 125%. Beijing said at the weekend that the reprieve for smartphones was a “small step” toward easing the trade fight between the world’s two biggest economies. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion However, the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, said the reprieve was likely to be lifted in 90 days and reiterated Trump’s longstanding plan to apply a different, specific levy to the sector. Speaking on NBC, he said: “All those products are going to come under semiconductors, and they’re going to have a special focus-type of tariff to make sure that those products get reshored. We can’t be relying on China for fundamental things that we need.” Lutnick dismissed interpretations of Trump’s reprieve that argued it reflected the president’s realisation that his China tariffs were unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the US in the near future. On Sunday Trump warned that no country would be getting “off the hook” on his punishing tariffs, again singling out China for criticism. “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook’ for the unfair Trade Balances,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform. “Especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!” Apple has spent decades building up a finely tuned supply chain in east Asia, including inside China. The firm has pledged to move some facilities back to the US over the next four years, which will cost it $500bn, including constructing a giant factory in Texas for artificial intelligence servers but was expecting to retain much of its international network as it expands its sales. Trump’s move at the start of Aprilto impose tariffs on imports to the USbattered the stocks of tech’s magnificent seven – Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, they lost $2.1tn, or 14% of their value, from 2 April. Shares have recovered since last Wednesday after Trump paused the tariffs except on China, allowing tech firms to use India and other conduits to import smartphones.",

    "article_text": "TheMichigangovernor, Gretchen Whitmer – considered to be a 2028 White House Democratic contender – was trying to distance herself from a recent Oval Office appearance alongside Donald Trump, which saw her get photographed while blocking her face with binders. Whitmer visited the Republican president on Wednesday alongside a bipartisan delegation to discuss a northern Michigan ice storm, the state’s defense assets and tariffs, among other issues. Following the meeting, Whitmer was brought into the Oval Office where she – as the New York Timesdescribed– “stood glumly” during a press conference that saw Trump sign several executive orders thattargetedhis political opponents. In astatementto CNN, a spokesperson for Whitmer said the governor was caught off guard by the media appearance. “The governor was surprised that she was brought into the Oval Office during president Trump’s press conference without any notice of the subject matter,” the Whitmer spokesperson said. “Her presence is not an endorsement of the actions taken or statements made at that event.” The Whitmer administration’s efforts to distance her from the press conference came after the president praised her,saying: “We’re honored to have Gretchen Whitmer from Michigan, great state of Michigan, and she’s been, she’s really done an excellent job, very good person.” The comments marked a shift from his public comments made about the governor five years ago during the Covid-19 pandemic. At the time, Trumpsaidhe had a “big problem” with the “young, a woman governor” in Michigan, adding that “all she does is sit there and blame the federal government”. Whitmer, meanwhile, blamed Trump for a failed plot to kidnap her that was devised by rightwing extremists – a case that led to nine convictions. Speaking toreporters at a college event in Michigan after Wednesday’s press conference, Whitmer said: “It was not where I wanted to be or planned to be or would have liked to have been. “I disagree with a lot of stuff that was said and the actions that were taken. But I stayed in the room because I needed to make the case forMichigan, and that’s my job.” Whitmer nevertheless has been criticized, particularly online, including for blocking her face with binders at one point during the conference whilea picture was snapped. One userwroteon X: “She just stood there as he signed executive orders. Democrats, NO ONE IS COMING TO SAVE YOU.” Another person said: “One of my favorite things about things like this is that she would’ve been better off just having her photo taken. ‘(Normal) Gretchen Whitmer in the White House’ would’ve been a lot less embarrassing than ‘(Hiding) Gretchen Whitmer.’” Someone elsewrote: “Is [Whitmer] hiding from the press here? Or still hiding from the people of Michigan?” Whitmer’s state is one of the most crucial electoral battlegrounds in the US. With base Democratic voters increasingly criticizing members of their party for not taking a harder line against theTrump administration, Whitmer has said publicly that she does not regard herself as “the leader of the opposition”. In January, shetoldthe Associated Press: “I have shared with some of my colleagues from some of the very blue states that my situation here in Michigan is very different than theirs. I’ve got a Republican House of Representatives – majority-Republican House – now to work with. “I’ve got to make sure that I can deliver and work with folks of the federal government, and so I don’t view myself as the leader of the opposition like some might.” Echoing similar sentiments, Adrian Hemond, the chief executive of the political consulting firm Grassroots Midwest, recentlytold: “She’s been trying to work with Trump since he got back in office, which is appropriate. “She’s a swing-state governor.” Meanwhile, David Dulio, a political science professor at Michigan’s Oakland University, told the outlet: “It is more a reflection of the state of the Democratic party that a popular Midwestern governor can go to Washington, get some wins on bipartisan issues and get attacked for it by her own people.” Whitmer was first elected as Michigan’s governor in 2018 and then re-elected in 2022 by a wider margin than her first victory.",

Houthi-affiliated Al Masirah news reported on Sunday that two US raids also targeted the al-Yatmah area in Khab and al-Sha’af District in al-Jawf governate, northern Yemen. In a separate statement on Sunday evening, the group said a US MQ-9 drone was shot down in the airspace of Hajjah governorate by a locally made surface-to-air missile. The US has not commented on that so far. Houthi-held areas of Yemen have seen near-daily deadly strikes blamed on the US since Washingtonlaunched an air campaignagainst the group on March 15 to force them to stop threatening vessels in key maritime routes. Dozens of people in Yemen have been killed in the latest US strikes. Civilians have been targeted,families wiped out, military sites destroyed and soldiers killed. The Houthis began targeting ships transiting the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, as well as Israeli territory, after the outbreak of the Gaza war in October 2023, pausing the attacks during a January ceasefire. Israel cut off all supplies to Gaza at the start of March andresumed its offensiveon the Palestinian territory on March 18, ending the short-lived truce. Since then, the Houthis have launched attacks targeting US military ships and Israel in solidarity with Palestinians. The group on Sunday claimed responsibility for a missile launched towards a military base in the Israeli port city of Ashdod and Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv. Sirens could be heard in Jerusalem around 6:16pm local time (15:16 GMT). The Israeli military said it believed it was successful in intercepting the incoming missile. The Houthis have backed the Gaza ceasefire agreement reached between Israel and Hamas and have repeatedly pledged to halt their military operations if a truce comes into force.",

    "title": "Trump warns China ‘not getting off the hook’ on US tariffs for electronics",
    "article_text": "United States President Donald Trump has said that no one is “getting off the hook” on trade after his administration appeared to dial down pressure on China by issuing a notice exemptingcertain high-techproducts from his “reciprocal” tariffs. In the latest twist in the Trump administration’strade waron Sunday, the president said that there were no exceptions to the tariffs, as smartphones, laptops and other products were still subject to an existing 20 percent duty and the items were being moved to a different tariff “bucket”. “We will not be held hostage by other Countries, especially hostile trading Nations like China,” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform. Speaking to reporters on board Air Force One later on Sunday, Trump said he would announce new tariffs on semiconductors over the next week. “The tariffs will be in place in the not distant future,” Trump said, adding that there would be flexibility for some companies in the sector. US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said earlier that the reprieve for high-tech products, many of which are manufactured in China, would be temporary and that semiconductor tariffs would be in place within weeks. “So what [Trump is] doing is he’s saying they’re [high-tech products] exempt from the reciprocal tariffs, but they’re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two. So these are coming soon,” Lutnick told ABC News. Tit-for-tat trade salvoes between the US and China have seen Washington raise import taxes on Chinese goods to 145 percent and Beijing retaliate with a125 percent dutyon US imports. Beijing initiallywelcomed Washington’s exemptions, describing them as a “small step” in the right direction, while calling on the Trump administration to “completely cancel” the tariffs. In a notice issued on Friday, US Customs and Border Protection listed 20 broadly definedcategories of high-techproducts not subject to the “reciprocal” tariffs, including semiconductors, flat panel displays and computers. “What is new is the apparent classification of goods as ‘semiconductors’. The list released on Friday night is much broader than what anyone else would call semiconductor,” Deborah Elms, the head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation in Singapore, told Al Jazeera. Trump’s latest comments appeared to pour cold water on hopes of a de-escalation in tensions between the world’s two largest economies. The remarks also added to widespread confusion about Trump’s trade policies, which have cast a pall of uncertainty over businesses and unnerved financial markets. “The mass confusion created by this constant news flow out of the White House is dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory and demand,” Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a note to investors on Sunday. The US president has sent global stock markets on arollercoaster ridein recent weeks with a dizzying series of back-and-forth announcements on tariffs. After his April 2 announcement of sweeping tariffs on dozens of trade partners sentstock markets into freefall, Trump last week abruptly announced a 90-day pause on most of the measures. The reprieve did not include China, the US’s third-largest trade partner, which was instead hit with even higher tariffs. The White House has said that Trump remains optimistic about securing a trade deal with China, although administration officials have made it clear they expect Beijing to reach out first. On Sunday, US stock futures – which are traded outside of regular market hours – moved higher, with those tied to the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite up about 0.5 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively, as of 10pm EST (03:00 GMT Monday).",

    "title": "Trump to meet Bukele as US deports more immigrants to El Salvador",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump will host El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele at the White House on Monday, as he seeks to deport more immigrants to a notorious maximum-security prison in the Central American country. The contentious deportation programme, which has faced several legal challenges, involves the US transferring alleged gang members to El Salvador, including Venezuelans accused of belonging to the Tren de Aragua group. Trump has praised Bukele’s government for accepting individuals the US labels as threats. “President Bukele has graciously accepted into his Nation’s custody some of the most violent alien enemies of the World… They will never threaten or menace our Citizens again!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. On Sunday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said 10 more alleged members of MS-13 and Tren de Aragua had been flown to El Salvador. “Last night, another 10 criminals from the MS-13 and Tren de Aragua Foreign Terrorist Organizations arrived in El Salvador,” Rubio said on X. He praised the Trump-Bukele alliance as an example of effective hemispheric cooperation. The Trump administration has relied on the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to justify these deportations. Hundreds have been transferred under this rarely used legislation, which allows the removal of nationals from countries deemed hostile during times of conflict. The administration claims all those deported were vetted and linked to gangs that the US considers “terrorist” organisations. But lawyers and family members of the detainees dispute these claims, saying many had no opportunity to challenge the accusations in court. Civil rights advocates argue that branding immigrants as gang members without judicial oversight violates due process. The US Supreme Court has ruled that detainees must receive proper notice to contest deportation orders. However, the decision left open the question of what legal recourse remains for those already sent to El Salvador. In one high-profile case, the Trump administration confirmed to a federal judge on Saturday that a Maryland man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported last month, remains confined in an El Salvador prison. But the government’s filing did not address the judge’s demands that the administration detail what steps it was taking to return Abrego Garcia to the US, only that he is under the authority of the El Salvador government. The US Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that the Trump administration must bring him back. Abrego Garcia’s case is likely to be on the agenda at the White House meeting.",

    "title": "Sudan’s RSF claims control of famine-hit Zamzam camp in Darfur",
    "article_text": "Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has announced that it took control of famine-hit Zamzam camp in the western Darfur region, aftertwo days of heavy shelling and gunfirethere and in nearby areas that killed at least 100 people, including children and aid workers. The RSF said in a statement on Sunday that it deployed “military units to secure civilians and humanitarian medical workers in Zamzam … after successfully liberating the camp entirely from the grip of” the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF). The paramilitary group on Friday launched ground and aerial assaults on North Darfur’s besieged capital of el-Fasher and the nearby Zamzam and Abu Shouk displacement camps. The United Nations said on Saturday that more than 100 people were feared dead in the RSF attacks, while an army-aligned faction led by Darfur Governor Minni Minnawi on Sunday put the toll at more than four times that. The RSF denied targeting civilians inside Zamzam, saying that the SAF was using the camp as a “military base” and using civilians as “human shields”. In recent weeks, the RSF has stepped up its attacks on refugee camps around el-Fasher in its effort to seize the last state capital in Darfur not under its control. About 180km (112 miles) east of el-Fasher, in Um Kadadah, activists also reported that the paramilitary killed 56 civilians over two days of attacks on a town they seized on the road to el-Fasher. The RSF has also been accused by rights groups of using brutal sexual violence as a weapon against civilians. The fighting intensified after the army last month recaptured the capital Khartoum, around 1,000km (620 miles) to the east. The conflict has essentially divided Sudan in two, with the army holding sway in the north and east, while the RSF controls most of Darfur and parts of the south. The war has killed tens of thousands, uprooted more than 12 million and created what the United Nations has described as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Zamzam and Abu Shouk are among five areas in Sudan where famine was detected by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, IPC, a global hunger monitoring group. An estimated 25 million people – half of Sudan’s population – are now facing extreme hunger.",

    "title": "Israel’s attack on al-Alhi Hospital in Gaza City draws global condemnation",
    "article_text": "A predawn Israelistrike on al-Ahli Hospitalin Gaza City, the last major hospital providing critical healthcare in northern Gaza, has sparked condemnation in Palestine and across the world as Israel continues toattack healthcare facilities. Israel on Sunday claimed it struck a Hamas command and control centre at the hospital, without providing evidence, while Hamas denied the allegations. The Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem, which runs al-Ahli Hospital, condemned the attack, saying it occurred on “Palm Sunday, the start of the Holy Week, the most sacred week of the Christian year.” It said the twin strikes demolished the hospital’s two-storey genetic laboratory and damaged the pharmacy and the emergency department buildings. The Higher Presidential Committee for Church Affairs in Palestine, which is affiliated with the Anglican Church, said the attack constituted “a grave violation of religious sanctity and fundamental principles of international humanitarian law”. The head of the committee, Ramzi Khoury, asserted that the attack was a direct affront to Palestinian Christians and the global Christian community. Britain’s Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell said in a statement on Sunday: “The Anglican-run Ahli Hospital in Gaza is a place of healing and care for Palestinians living through unimaginable suffering. In unbearable conditions, its heroic doctors and nurses have cared for civilians who have endured 18 months of devastating violence”. “For the only Christian hospital in Gaza to be attacked on Palm Sunday is especially appalling. I share in the grief of our Palestinian brothers and sisters in the Diocese of Jerusalem,” he said. Gaza’s Health Ministry said the bombing forced the evacuation of patients and staff. “We call on international institutions and relevant authorities to protect the health sector in accordance with international laws and agreements,” it said in a statement. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) said the “heinous aggression” was “part of a systematic series of attacks targeting hospitals, schools, shelters and tents for the displaced in Gaza, within the context of a systematic war of extermination that violates all humanitarian and moral standards”. PIJ blamed Israel for sowing panic among patients and staff by issuing a warning shortly before the strike. “The international silence on Gaza is forcing it to become a graveyard for law and humanity,” it added. Hospitals have special protection under international law. Israel has besieged and raided them nevertheless, some several times, and struck multiple ones while accusing Hamas of using them as cover for its fighters. Last month,Israel struck Nasser Hospitalin Khan Younis, the largest hospital in southern Gaza, killing two people and causing a large fire. Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the hospital was out of service and a child had died as a result of the disruption of care. The hospital was also forced to move 50 patients to other health centres, but 40 critical patients could not be moved, Tedros added. “Attacks on health care must stop,” the WHO chief wrote on X. “Once again we repeat: patients, health workers and hospitals must be protected. The aid blockade must be lifted. Ceasefire.” Al-Ahli hospital in#Gazais out of service following this morning’s evacuation order and attack –@WHOhas received an update from the hospital’s director. A child died due to disruption of care. The emergency room, laboratory, emergency room X-ray machines and the pharmacy… — Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (@DrTedros)April 13, 2025 British Foreign Minister David Lammy said Israel’s bombing of medical facilities had “comprehensively degraded access to healthcare” in the enclave. “Al-Ahli Hospital has been attacked repeatedly since the conflict began. These deplorable attacks must end. Diplomacy not more bloodshed is how we will achieve a lasting peace,” Lammy wrote on X. Qatar said the attack on the last functioning hospital in northern Gaza was a “horrific massacre and a heinous crime against civilians” that constituted a grave violation of international humanitarian law. The Foreign Ministry warned about the expansion of the cycle of violence across the region and said the international community must assume its responsibilities in protecting civilians. Jordan also condemned the attack as well as Israel’s systematic targeting of civilians in Gaza and the destruction of vital facilities that provide essential services to its population. Egypt, too, issued a statement, calling the attack a grave violation of international humanitarian law and international norms and appealing for the international community’s intervention in halting the attacks. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock questioned the modalities of the strike but stopped short of condemning the attack. “The cruel Hamas terror must be combated. But international humanitarian law applies, with a special obligation to protect civilian areas. How can a hospital be evacuated in less than 20 minutes?” she asked in a post on X.",

    "title": "How the sick and injured fled as Israel bombed Gaza’s al-Ahli Hospital",
    "article_text": "Gaza City, Gaza– Yousef Abu Sakran was dozing next to his injured child and wife, Iman, in a tent ward at al-Ahli Arab Hospital when the sounds of people running and shouting woke him up. He stepped into the hospital courtyard well before dawn on Sunday to ask what was happening but found no clear answer, only vague news that the Israeli army had made calls to people living around the hospital, demanding theexpulsion of everyone in the medical facility. The 29-year-old father reacted instantly. He scooped up his five-year-old son, Mohammad, and he and Iman ran towards the gate. Mohammad has severe injuries across his body, including third-degree burns on his back and legs, but Yousef had to keep running with him. “I was carrying my son, whose body was burned, and running while he screamed,” Yousef said. “His back was bleeding – his wounds were bleeding heavily – and he was screaming in agony. “[So many people’s] injuries reopened from the sudden movement. I saw the family of a girl with spinal injuries trying to pull her bed, but it was stuck in the debris. “Just seconds after we left the hospital, it was struck by two missiles that shook the entire place. I told my wife: ‘Imagine if we had been a minute later. We’d be dead.'” Yousef and his wife were in the street with everyone else from the hospital. “It was around 2am, and I had no idea where to take my injured son. He was in pain and bleeding. There were no clinics or hospitals, and the tent we live in is very far and completely unsuitable for his condition.” Mohammad had been injured in an Israeli air strike on a block of homes in Gaza’s Shujayea neighbourhood, which killed more than 20 people and wounded dozens. An hour after the hospital was bombed, Yousef and his wife decided there was nothing they could do other than take Mohammad back to al-Ahli. “The place was pitch-black, and it reeked of gunpowder and dust. I went to the surgery building at the far end of the hospital, where I found a nurse who took pity on Mohammad’s condition, treated his wounds and admitted him.” Bombing a hospital like this, Yousef said, is a stain on humanity’s conscience. “They bomb our homes over our heads and then bomb hospitals while patients and the wounded are inside. Where are we supposed to go? “Isn’t all this grief and suffering enough?” Suhaib Hamed, 20, was asleep in another tent ward, right next to the hospital’s emergency building, which was hit. Hamed was injured when he went to fetch flour for his starving family on February 29, 2024 – a day known as the “Flour Massacre“, during which Israel killed 109 Palestinians and wounded dozens while they waited for food aid. He was shot in the leg by Israeli tanks, damaging his bones and tissue to the point that he needed metal implants and has been in the orthopaedic department since then. “My brother, who usually stays with me, wasn’t there. I don’t even know how I managed to stand on my injured leg, grab my crutches and flee,” Suhaib told Al Jazeera as he exited the surgery department after having the wounds to his leg cleaned and checked. “I forgot my pain because of what I saw around me. Everyone was screaming in terror and fear, just trying to survive. It felt like the Day of Judgement.” Suhaib also managed to get out of the hospital minutes before two Israeli missiles landed. “My leg couldn’t handle it any more, and my wound reopened and started bleeding again.” He couldn’t keep walking, so he stopped and called his brother, who came and supported him to their home in the Zeitoun neighbourhood, a half-hour’s walk for a healthy person on undamaged roads. The pain in his leg kept Suhaib up, but he was also worried about the hospital being forced to close. “I’ve been staying in the hospital [for more than a year] because of my condition,” he said. Suhaib has a medical referral to travel outside Gaza for treatment but has been waiting to leave for a year. “Isn’t the closure and banning of our travel enough? They even target the hospital that was still treating us with the little that’s available.” The Israeli strike on al-Ahli has exacerbated an already catastrophic situation for Gaza’s healthcare system, which has been collapsing as Israeli bombardments and a blockade on medicines, medical supplies and fuel continues. In the panic that ensued because Israel did not give hospital staff even the bare minimum of time to evacuate patients, a child died due to lack of oxygen, Fadel Naeem, director of al-Ahli, told Al Jazeera. Israel destroyed the vital emergency, radiology, laboratory and central pharmacy departments, the doctor continued. “We’ll need weeks or months to resume operations,” he noted. “This hospital is a hub for services and includes all essential facilities, including the only CT scan machine available. “The fate of patients and the wounded is now unknown. We’ll have to distribute them to other hospitals, but no hospital is equipped to provide full services.”",

    "article_text": "Pope Francis has held an in-person greeting with the faithful in St Peter’s Square on Palm Sunday in yet another positive public sign of his recovery from alife-threatening battle with double pneumonia. On Sunday, the 88-year-old pontiff wished more than 20,000 people a “happy Palm Sunday, happy Holy Week” as he sat in a wheelchair without nasal tubes for supplemental oxygen. The Vatican said it was waiting to announce what role he may play in Holy Week events leading up to Easter on April 20 after doctors advised him to avoid crowds. He did not heed their advice on Sunday as he thanked the faithful for their prayers. “At this time of physical weakness, they help me to feel God’s closeness, compassion and tenderness even more,” he said before urging them to carry the cross “of those who suffer around us” to mark the start of the solemn Holy Week. Many in the crowd sought to touch Francis’s hand or garments as he was brought in a wheelchair to the main altar. The pontiff also offered prayers for those suffering in the conflict in Sudan, which marks its second anniversary on Tuesday, as well as for peace inUkraine, the Middle East, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Myanmar, South Sudan and for Lebanon, whosecivil warbegan 50 years ago Sunday. The appearance was his second in St Peter’s Square before a crowd since leaving hospital on March 23. He made an unexpected appearance last Sunday, which was greeted with joy by the faithful. He alsomet privately with Britain’s King Charles IIIand Queen Camilla this week and made an impromptu tour of St Peter’s Basilica. Francis was discharged from Gemelli University Hospital in Rome after a five-week hospitalisation. Doctors said he would need two months of rest at the Vatican.",

    "title": "Gabon military leader Brice Oligui Nguema wins presidential election",
    "article_text": "Gabon’s military leaderBrice Oligui Nguemahas won the country’s presidential election by an apparent landslide, according to provisional results. The Interior Ministry said on Sunday that Nguema, who led a 2023 military coup, had secured about 90 percent of the vote. His main rival, Alain Claude Bilie-By-Nze, had won some three percent of Saturday’s vote, according to the initial results. Nguema, who had been instrumental in ending 55 years of dynastic rule of the Bongo family, was widely expected to win the eight-candidate race. On election day, Bilie-By-Nze had warned about “potential” problems during the counting, but Nguema said the electoral process was “transparent”. Following his victory, Nguema spoke exclusively to Al Jazeera in his first international news interview, promising to “restore dignity to the Gabonese people”. “I will give back to the people what they have given me today. And everything that has been stolen from the people, I want to return to them,” Nguema told Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem. Nguema declared the country’s foreign policy a success, citing increased international engagement and diplomatic achievements under his leadership. “We have a foreign policy that I intend to make assertive,” he said, adding that Gabon has positioned itself as a cooperative partner with major global powers, including the United States, France, Russia, and China. “That has worked well during the transition,” he noted. Nguema highlighted a series of diplomatic milestones achieved in under two years. “We have received 20 ambassadors, with six accredited here in Libreville,” he said, noting that new embassies have opened, including those from the United Kingdom and India. He also revealed that Serbia and the United Arab Emirates are expected to follow soon, further boosting Gabon’s diplomatic presence. “This means that, in 19 months, I have achieved a lot,” Nguema said. “And I have succeeded on all fronts — not just me, but the Gabonese people have succeeded on all fronts.” Reporting from Libreville, Hashem said the outcome of the election came as no surprise, and focus has already shifted to the president’s looming challenges. “Nguema inherits a country that spent five decades under Bongo rule,” said Hashem. The Bongo dynasty ruled Gabon through aweb of patronage, distributing influential posts to allies and family members. That political structure kept power concentrated in the hands of a few, while the majority of citizens saw little benefit from the country’s vast wealth. Gabon, home to around 2.2 million people, sits on the Atlantic coast of West-Central Africa. It holds substantial reserves of oil, gold, and manganese and is part of the Congo Basin — a vital rainforest ecosystem. Yet, despite its natural riches, nearly 40 percent of young people remain unemployed, according to the World Bank’s 2024 data. “People here are focused on immediate needs: restoring electricity, addressing food shortages, creating jobs, and — most importantly — ensuring the country’s vast natural wealth, including oil, gold and manganese, benefits ordinary citizens,” Hashem said. Nguema, once head of the Republican Guard under former President Ali Bongo, campaigned as a reformer. Wearing a baseball cap emblazoned with his slogan “We Build Together”, he promised to clean up corruption, diversify the oil-heavy economy, and invest in agriculture, tourism and industry. Around a third of the population of Gabon still lives below the poverty line. Voter turnout in the election reached 70.4 percent, significantly higher than the 56.65 percent recorded in the disputed August 2023 vote, which saw Bongo declared the winner of a third term. The opposition rejected the result, and a military coup followed hours later. Although Nguema now has a seven-year mandate — renewable once — many remain sceptical of real change. “The political establishment in Gabon is still deeply intertwined with the Bongo era,” said Hashem. “The general himself led the Republican Guard under Ali Bongo, while his main rival in the election served as prime minister under the same regime. So people are wondering: is this a genuine break from the old system, or just a rebranding?” Meanwhile, international observers and investors are watching closely. Gabon, with $3bn in international debt, is under pressure to prove it can turn the page and build democratic legitimacy. According to the World Bank, the economy expanded by 2.9 percent in 2024, up from 2.4 percent the year before—buoyed by infrastructure development and higher output of oil, timber and manganese.",

    "title": "Liverpool beat West Ham to move within six points of Premier League title",
    "article_text": "Virgil van Dijk has spared Liverpool’s blushes with a late winner tobeat West Ham 2-1and edge to within six points of the Premier League title. Andy Robertson’s own goal four minutes from time on Sunday had given the lowly Hammers a deserved equaliser after Luis Diaz put Liverpool in front early on at Anfield. Van Dijk, though, swiftly restored the lead to show Liverpool retain the mentality of champions, even if they are running out of steam in the closing stages of the season. Liverpool’s lead over second-placed Arsenal now stretches to 13 points with six games remaining. A record-equalling 20th English top-flight title could come as early as next Sunday if Liverpool win at Leicester and Arsenal lose away to Ipswich. The stage was set before kickoff for Mohamed Salah to be the hero as the Egyptian was given a huge ovation just days after ending speculation over his future by signing anew two-year contractwith Liverpool. Salah started with the intention of making sure he was the focus of attention as young left back Ollie Scarles struggled to cope with the Premier League’s top scorer. The 32-year-old has failed to score in seven of his last eight Liverpool games as his sensational early season form has tailed off. But he still managed to set a new Premier League record by registering his 45th goal or assist of the campaign, the most ever in a 38-game season. Salah outmuscled Scarles on the touchline and sprinted clear before an inch-perfect cross for Diaz allowed the Colombian to tap in for his 15th goal of the season on 18 minutes. Defeat saw West Ham slip to 17th in the table, but they had a series of chances to take at least a point. The fatigue that has seen Liverpool struggle recently was in evidence again as they had goalkeeper Alisson Becker to thank for moving another three points closer to the title. Alisson brilliantly tipped Mohammed Kudus’s attempted chip onto the bar during the visitors’ first serious attack. Jarrod Bowen had West Ham’s best chance to level when he failed to beat Alisson when one-on-one with the Brazilian before he turned away another powerful drive by Kudus. When West Ham did finally find the net, it was thanks to two of Liverpool’s most experienced defenders. Robertson and van Dijk both went for the same ball, and the Scotland captain diverted Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s cross into his own net. The goal suddenly sparked Liverpool into life after a listless second half as a deflected effort from Diaz went over the bar. Van Dijk took just three minutes to make amends for the equaliser as he powered in Alexis Mac Allister’s corner. The Dutchman kissed the badge in celebration, a potential nod to him reportedly being close to following Salah in signing a new contract. There was still more drama to come as Niclas Fullkrug hit the bar for West Ham in stoppage time. But Liverpool held out to take another step towards the title in Arne Slot’s first season in charge. “These things [the own goal] unfortunately happen, and it was time to make it right,” van Dijk told Sky Sports after the match. “On to the next one. I am very happy to captain my 100th game for Liverpool. It was an emotional day [being so close to the anniversary of theHillsborough disaster], and that was the main focus. One step closer to all our dreams. “Everyone knows how much I love this club, and let’s see what next week will look like.” Elsewhere in the Premier League on Sunday, relegation-threatened Ipswich Town held Chelsea to a 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge, denying the hosts the chance to inject new momentum into their bid for a place in next season’s Champions League. The draw pushed Chelsea into the last of the five Champions League spots but one point ahead of Newcastle United, who were due to play Manchester United later on Sunday and have a further game in hand. Ipswich remained in 18th place and almost certain to return to the second tier next season. Meanwhile, an error-strewn performance by Tottenham Hotspur saw them lose 4-2 away to Wolverhampton Wanderers on Sunday, their fourth loss in six Premier League games, deepening coach Ange Postecoglou’s crisis but easing the hosts’ relegation worries. Wolves made the most of West Ham United’s 2-1 loss away to Liverpool to go 16th in the table on 35 points, ahead of the Hammers on goal difference and 14 points clear of 17th-placed Ipswich with six games to play.",

    "title": "China says US tariff exemptions ‘small step in correcting wrong practice’",
    "article_text": "China has welcomed the announcement by the United States of a series ofexemptions from import levies on consumer electronics, which it said was a “small step” in correcting President Donald Trump’s “wrong practice” of imposing 145 percent tariffs on Chinese goods. “China is now evaluating the impact,” a Ministry of Commerce spokesperson said in a statement on Sunday, after Washington said smartphones, computers and other electronics would be excluded. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Sunday told ABC’s This Week that smartphones, computers and some other electronics would come under separate tariffs, along with semiconductors that may be imposed in a month or so. Beijing called on Washington to “completely cancel” its reciprocal tariffs. “We urge the US to … take a big step to correct its mistakes, completely cancel the wrong practice of ‘reciprocal tariffs’ and return to the right path of mutual respect,” the Commerce Ministry statement said. The Trump administration late on Friday granted exclusions from steep tariffs on electronics, imported largely from China, providing a big break to tech firms like Apple that rely on imported products. The move came as retaliatory Chinese import tariffs of 125 percent on US goods took effect on Saturday, with Beijing standing defiant against its primary trade competitor. Washington and Beijing’s escalating tariff battle has raised fears of an enduring trade war between the world’s two largest economies and sent global markets into a tailspin. The fallout has sent shockwaves through the US economy, with investors dumping government bonds and the dollar tumbling. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CBS Sunday that there are no plans yet for Trump to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Trump insisted on Friday on his Truth Social platform that “we are doing really well on our tariff policy”, even after Beijing announced its latest hike. While Trump has referred to tariffs as a way to bring manufacturing back to the US, analysts say it will likely take years to ramp up domestic production.",

    "title": "Over three million children died in 2022 due to drug resistance: Study",
    "article_text": "More than three million children, many of them from Southeast Asia and Africa, are believed to have lost their lives in 2022 due to infections that are resistant to antibiotics, according to a new research. “The study underscores the urgent need for both regional and global strategies to combat pediatric AMR,” the report released in Austria on Sunday said, referring to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) infections. “AMR poses a critical threat to children, who are highly vulnerable to infections.” In the report, the scientific group ESCMID said more than 752,000 children in Southeast Asia and 659,000 in Africa died due to complications linked to the infections. More than 1.5 million deaths were recorded in other regions of the world. Professor Joseph Harwell, co-author of the study from the Clinton Health Access Initiative, explained that due to the overuse or misuse of some medications, some bacteria have evolved, becoming more resistant to some antibiotics. “If bacteria develop resistance to these antibiotics, there will be few, if any, alternatives for treating multidrug-resistance infections,” Harwell said. He said the rise in the use of some types of antibiotics presents “several serious long-term risks”, especially among children. Of the estimated three million child deaths in 2022, two million have been associated with the use of Watch and Reserve antibiotics. Watch antibiotics are those considered as drugs with a high risk of resistance, while reserve antibiotics are those considered as last-line treatments for serious and multidrug-resistant infections. Both antibiotics are not intended for first-line treatment, but their use has increased exponentially in Asia and Africa. Several factors contribute to the severity of antibiotic-resistant infections in low- and middle-income countries, including overcrowded hospitals, poor sanitation, and weak infection prevention measures, the study said. The lack of effective surveillance in those countries also makes it difficult to track resistance trends and establish effective treatment protocols, it added. “Addressing this issue requires urgent and coordinated action at both regional and global levels,” the study added.",

    "title": "Timeline: Israel’s attacks on hospitals throughout its war on Gaza",
    "article_text": "An Israeli air raid has left the last functioning hospital in northern Gaza nonoperational, forcing critically ill patients onto the streets. The latest attack onal-Ahli Arab Hospitalon Sunday comes as Israel seized a corridor south of the war-battered Palestinian territory and said it planned to expand its military offensive after breaking up a ceasefire in March. Gaza’s Civil Defence said the Israeli air force targeted a building of the hospital in the early hours on Sunday. The Israeli army and the Shin Bet agency claimed, without providing evidence, to have targeted a Hamas “command and control complex” in the hospital. Gaza’s healthcare facilities have been targeted repeatedly, including with 2,000-pound bombs made in the United States. Al-Ahli Hospital is one of at least 36 hospitals that have been bombed and burned by the Israeli military since the start of the war. Targeting of health facilities, medical personnel and patients is considered a war crime under the 1949 Geneva Convention. Here’s a list of some of the major attacks on healthcare in Gaza since October 2023: Hundreds of people sheltering in the car park of al-Ahli Hospital werekilledin an Israeli attack, according to Palestinian health officials. In the days leading up to the incident, the hospital director reportedly received warnings from Israel. Israel attributed the explosion at the facility to a misfired rocket launched by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an allegation denied by the armed group. An ambulance convoy was destroyed by an Israeli air attack outside al-Shifa Hospital, resulting in many Palestinian deaths. An air raid on al-Awda Hospital killed Dr Mahmoud Abu Nujaila and Dr Ahmad al-Sahar of Doctors Without Borders (MSF), and another doctor, Ziad al-Tatari. Several people were killed while sheltering about 150 metres (about 500 feet) from the entrance of Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis. Evacuees sheltering in the area suffered due to fighting and forced evacuation orders. The Israeli military said itkilled 90 peoplein its raid on al-Shifa Hospital during a siege as displaced Palestinians sheltering in the facility described long detentions and abuse. Hamas condemned the “bloody massacre” in the hospital and said civilians, patients and displaced people were among those killed. Many people were killed and injured in an air raid on the yard of Al-Aqsa Hospital, just outside the emergency room where many internally displaced people were sheltering. A 14-day siege of al-Shifa Hospital, the largest hospital in the enclave, by Israeli forces saw hundreds of people killed, including medical staff, and mass arrests of its staff and others. An Israeli air attack on Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir el-Balah killed five people and wounded 65. Tents of displaced people caught fire while people were sleeping. The Israeli army arrested Dr Hussam Abu Safia, the director of Kamal Adwan Hospital, after refusing to follow orders to abandon one of the last functioning hospitals in northern Gaza. His arrest came a day after the military killed approximately 20 Palestinians and apprehended about 240 in a raid inside the hospital, which was one of the“largest operations” conductedin the territory until that time. Israeli forceslaid siegeto the Indonesia Hospital in Beit Lahiya for days. The Israeli forces left the hospital in ruins, with charred and decomposing bodies piling up in corners. TheIndonesian Hospitalin north Gaza was put out of service following repeated attacks by Israeli forces, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health. Israeli forces reportedlyshot 15 Palestinian medics, working for the Palestine Red Crescent Society, dead during a rescue mission in Rafah’s Tal as-Sultan neighbourhood. A video recovered from the mobile phone of one of the killed Palestinian medics showed Israeli forces’ involvement, igniting widespread outrage.",

    "title": "Fighting Alcaraz claims maiden Monte Carlo title before French Open",
    "article_text": "Carlos Alcaraz has overcome a slow start to beat an injury-stricken Lorenzo Musetti 3-6, 6-1, 6-0 in the Monte Carlo Masters final, clinching his first title at the prestigious clay-court event and gaining momentum going into next month’s French Open. The Spaniard dropped his opening two service games and struggled to find his range early on Sunday, particularly on his usually reliable forehand, as Musetti took full advantage to claim the first set. But Alcaraz responded with a dominant display in the second, winning five straight games to take control of the match. His physical power and improved shot selection proved too much for the Italian world number 16, who was seeking his first Masters 1000 title. Alcaraz broke in the first and third games of the deciding set, maintaining his grip on the contest to seal victory in the first major European clay-court event of the season. Musetti started showing signs of a right-leg injury in the third set and received treatment at 0-3. Playing in his first Masters 1000 final, the 23-year-old Italian had trouble moving and keeping up with Alcaraz towards the end of the match. “This is not the way I want to win a match. I really feel sorry for him,” Alcaraz said. “Just really happy to have won the Monte Carlo for the first time. It’s been a really difficult week with a lot of difficult situations. I’m really proud of myself, how I dealt with everything.” Alcaraz has struggled at times this year and was coming off an opening-round loss to David Goffin in Miami. It was Alcaraz’s third consecutive clay-court final after winning the French Open and finishing with a silver medal at the Paris Olympics last year. Alcaraz was playing in his 23rd tour-level final andwill move up a place in the rankings and displace Alexander Zverev at number two. Some consolation for Musetti is a rise to 11th in the rankings and the promise of more to come on the clay as the season builds towards the French Open at Roland Garros. “It was probably one of my best tournaments so far,” he said. “I’m disappointed I couldn’t finish the match in the best way for the crowd. You deserve it, so I will keep going and try and come back for revenge.”",

    "title": "Polls close in Ecuador for tight presidential run-off election",
    "article_text": "Polls have closed in Ecuador in a closepresidential run-offpitting the incumbent conservative, Daniel Noboa, against leftist lawyer Luisa Gonzalez. Initial results are expected at  7pm (00:00 GMT) Sunday. More than 13 million people were eligible to vote in the drug-violence-wracked nation. Analysts expect a razor-thin outcome and fear that could spark claims of fraud and lead to a government with a weak mandate. Noboa, a 37-year-old conservative, has been president for just over 16 months after beatingGonzalez, 47, in a 2023 snap election. In February’s first round of voting, Noboa won 44.17 percent of the votes while Gonzalez garnered 44 percent. Pollsters say either could win. Voters are primarily worried about the violence that has transformed the country since 2021 – a spike in crime tied to the trafficking of cocaine produced in neighbouring Colombia and Peru. This once-peaceful Andean nation averaged a killing every hour at the start of the year, as cartels vied for control over cocaine routes that pass through Ecuador’s ports. Both candidates have offered solutions. Noboa declared Ecuador to be in a state of “internal armed conflict” in January 2024, allowing him to deploy thousands of soldiers to the streets to combat gangs and to charge people with “terrorism” counts for alleged ties to organised crime. He says his security plan, which also includes beefed-up port security and more seizures of drugs and guns, is paying dividends. The homicide rate dropped to 38.76 per 100,000 people in 2024 from a high of 46.18 per 100,000 people in 2023. On the eve of the vote, Noboa declared a 60-day state of emergency in Quito and several provinces, underscoring the tense state of affairs. Heir to a fortune built on the banana trade, the incumbent opened an event-organising company when he was 18 and then joined his father’s Noboa Corp, where he held management positions in the shipping, logistics and commercial areas. His rival Gonalez, if she prevails, could become Ecuador’s first elected female president — a historic milestone. But the candidacy of the single mother, who has pitched herself as a humble everywoman, has been plagued by questions about her longstanding ties to former President Rafael Correa – a polarising figure forced into exile after a court found him guilty of accepting bribes. Gonzalez held various government jobs during Correa’s presidency from 2007 to 2017. While his detractors accuse him of being a corrupt authoritarian, his supporters view him as a champion of the working class who stood up to foreign oil companies. In the run-up to the second round, the final two candidates have been attempting to court Indigenous voters. Gonzalez has the backing of potential kingmakerLeonidas Iza,a powerful Indigenous leader who secured five percent of the first-round vote.",

This, after his tariff policy sent markets globally into a freefall and left business leaders and even pro-Trump Republicans warning of a recession. While the White House will be looking to cut deals with other nations on the levies, Trump has ramped up his trade dispute with China.

    "title": "France can and must do more than recognising Palestinian statehood",
    "article_text": "On Wednesday, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France is preparing to recognise Palestinian statehood within a few months. If it proceeds, Paris would become the 12th European Union member to officially accept the existence of the Palestinian state. Last year, Slovenia, Ireland and Spain did so, bringing the total number of EU states recognising Palestine to 11 out of 27. The French recognition would be a significant step in the right direction, especially if it affirms Palestine’s 1967 borders and East Jerusalem as its capital, respecting international law provisions and the international consensus. This could move other European countries to do the same, including Luxembourg and Portugal and could put significant pressure on others, notably the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Belgium. However, France is at risk of turning its recognition of Palestine into another empty gesture to save face amid growing opposition among Europeans to the Israeli occupation of Palestine and the genocide in Gaza. Under Macron, France has been far from meeting its legal and political obligations towards Palestine, turning a blind eye to Israel’s horrific crimes and violations. In this context, the French announcement can be seen as a diplomatic move that is too little, too late. Until recently, Western powers largely conditioned the recognition of Palestine on the outcome of peace negotiations, which in reality meant giving Israel a veto right over Palestinian statehood. This is because Israel does not want negotiations to produce a solution – whether a two-state one along the 1967 borders or a one-state one in which Palestinians and Israelis have equal rights. Israeli law opposes recognition of Palestine and the fulfilment of the Palestinian right to self-determination, but Western powers have continued to act as if this was not the case. Israel was given this leverage over Palestine despite the fact that its own statehood was based on United Nations Resolution 181, which called for the creation of two states, and its membership in the UN was conditioned on the implementation of Resolutions 181 and 194 – the latter pertaining to the right of return for Palestinian refugees. Successive Israeli governments have systematically violated both resolutions as well as many others without facing any consequences from their Western allies. Now that the Israeli government has finally made clear that its plan is ethnic cleansing and annexation of all of Palestine, some Western countries seem to be reconsidering their stance and are opting to recognise Palestinian statehood. While recognition is important, it cannot be the only step a country such as France should take to implement the Palestinian right to self-determination. France is a former colonial power in the Middle East, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, a leading member of the EU, one of Israel’s most important trading partners and an important donor for Palestine. As such, it has the moral and legal obligation to do more than that. Recognition on its own is not going to stop the ongoing ethnic cleansing and annexation. These processes continue unabated because countries like France fail to act and hold Israel accountable. For example, France was one of the first European countries to grant de facto immunity to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant against him in November. Paris has opened its airspace on several occasions for Netanyahu to fly over on his way to the United States in violation of its obligations under the Rome Statute, the treaty that established the ICC. Despite growing calls for an arms embargo on Israel, France has continued to sell weapons to the Israeli army during the ongoing genocide. French citizens face no repercussions for engaging in settler-colonialism in the occupied West Bank or serving in the Israeli occupation forces, which have been repeatedly accused of committing horrific war crimes. Likewise, France continues to tolerate the fundraising for illegal Israeli settlements while several French companies have contributed to the ongoing annexation process of occupied Palestinian territory. France has been granted a special role in Jerusalem with regards to protecting the status quo benefits of Christian denominations. However, it has hardly taken any concrete measures to stop ongoing Israeli attempts to impose illegal taxes on churches and take over church property. If France is truly interested in being a broker of peace in the Middle East, it needs to do more than just recognising Palestinian statehood. It must act in accordance with its obligations under the UN Charter and the Rome Statute. It must put real pressure on Israel to end its occupation and colonisation of Palestinian land and take action against French citizens and companies involved in them. It must reverse its decision to grant immunity to Israeli officials wanted by the ICC. At the EU level, France must join Spain and Ireland in demanding a review of the EU-Israel Association Agreement in light of Israel’s flagrant violation of Article 2, which stipulates that relations should be based on respect for human rights. It goes without saying that the Israeli government opposes any recognition of Palestine and will make use of its available tools to prevent it. It could apply pressure by mobilising domestic opposition, coordinating with close Israeli allies, such as the United States, and taking action against diplomats based in Jerusalem – among other tactics. This will force France to face its moment of truth: Is it willing to stand up for its principles, or will it succumb to Israeli blackmail? Will it lead the way in Europe on respecting international obligations, or will it let its recognition of Palestine remain an empty gesture? At a time when US President Donald Trump’s administration endorses ethnic cleansing as an official policy and the EU is at its lowest political point with regards to Palestine, France has the opportunity to make a difference. It can join other EU members, like Spain and Ireland, which along with the Global South are pushing for a rules-based international order where Palestine is no longer the exception to the norm. It can live up to its own motto of “liberté, égalité, fraternité” by supporting the Palestinian people’s pursuit of liberty, equality and fraternity.

    "article_text": "On this day in 1975, Claude Salhani was a 23-year-old Lebanese photojournalist working for the Annahar newspaper. At the time, he dreamed of going to Vietnam and taking the kind of powerful war images he had seen and admired. However, he wouldn’t have to leave his country to cover war. On April 13, 1975, the Phalangist militia attacked a bus in Beirut’s Ain el-Remmaneh neighbourhood, kicking off a civil war that lasted 15 years. The bus was carrying Palestinians and Lebanese home from a political rally by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command (PFLP-GC). The Phalangists were responding to a drive-by assassination attempt on their leader, Pierre Gemayel, outside a church. Gemayel was unscathed, but others were killed, including Gemayel’s bodyguard and a Phalangist whose child was being baptised that day. The lead-up to the Lebanese Civil War was not devoid of other incidents, but Salhani said it was clear something was different after that day. Over the next nine years, Salhani would capture the brutal reality of the war – Christian and pro-Palestinian militias, the warlords pulling their strings and, most importantly, their victims. He was threatened by right-wing Christian militias, kidnapped by a Palestinian faction, and wounded by Israeli shelling that broke his ankle and a car crash that left his two front teeth hanging by their roots. Salhani covered the war for Annahar, the French photo agency Sygma, and the United Press International and Reuters news agencies. His images were featured on the cover of news magazines like Time and Newsweek. In 1983, he was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for a photo of a young man dressed in US military fatigues, wiping away a tear after two suicide trucks rammed a barracks and killed more than 240 US military members. He left Beirut in 1984, hurt by what his home had become. He promised never to return but came back for a visit in 2000 and then returned infrequently until his death. Salhani died in 2022 in Paris at the age of 70. He spoke of returning to Lebanon until his final days.",

Musk’s favorability in polls is on a downward slide. byWes Davis Elon Musk’s popularity with the American public is waning, according to thelatest polling averagefrom Nate Silver’sSilver Bulletin. The billionaire CEO of multiple companies wears many hats, but the most visible one of late has been as the face of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an organization that has been tearing through the US government administrative state. Silver Bulletin’s average shows that 53.5 percent of Americans have an unfavorable view of Musk, and only 39.6 percent of Americans see him favorably. His unpopularity is way up since the beginning of 2024 when only 38 percent of people disliked him, according to the site’s tracker. Silver writes that his process for tracking Musk’s ratings is similar to how he tracks President Trump’s, but with “slightly more conservative settings as Musk is polled less often than Trump.” According toSilver Bulletin,negative views of the billionaire have been especially trending upwards in the wake of his heavy support — in partby paying voters— for Trump’s second Presidential campaign and, not long after, the beginning of his work at DOGE. That work has seen widespread federal agency layoffs as DOGE’s operatives access, or attempt to gain access, to sensitive areas of the government, includingIRS records, theUS Treasury’s payments system, and theUS Social Security Administration. However accurateSilver Bulletin’s average is, the site is not alone in noting Musk’s unpopularity. Outlets likeFox News,Politico, andAxioshave all recently pointed to polls showing a growing distaste for the billionaire. That may have already had electoral consequences for Republicans in Wisconsin, where Musk’s attempt to bolster a conservative Supreme Court candidate this month — using thesame voter-paying tacticshe used during Trump’s campaign — appear to have backfired. More than half of voters in the state disapproved of his involvement, and about a third said it made them less likely to vote for the conservative justice, according to pollster informationpublished byThe Washington Post. In the end, Democrat-backed candidate Susan Crawford won by 10 points, preserving Wisconsin’s highest court’s 4-3 liberal majority.

    "article_text": "Apparent AI-cloned voices of Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have been lampooning the tech CEOs in California crosswalks. Apparent AI-cloned voices of Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have been lampooning the tech CEOs in California crosswalks. byWes Davis Crosswalk buttons in at least three California cities appear to have been hacked this weekend to give them the seemingly AI-generated voices of Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. In videos posted online, the apparent voice of Musk begs listeners to be his friend, or that of Zuckerberg brags about “undermining democracy” and “cooking our grandparents’ brains with AI slop.” A Palo Alto, California city spokespersontoldPalo Alto Onlinethat city employees “determined that 12 downtown intersections were impacted,” and have disabled the crosswalks’ voice features pending repairs. The signals otherwise work as they should, they told the outlet. The hack seemed to have taken place on Friday, the person said. The same thing is happening in Redwood City, where a deputy city managertoldThe San Francisco Chroniclethat the city is investigating and attempting to resolve the issue there. Crosswalk buttons in Menlo Park are also reportedly affected. The voice features of these buttons are used to guide people with difficulty seeing, letting them know when to “wait” and when the walk sign on the other end of the street has turned on. It’s hard to tell how much, if at all, the simulated voices interfere with that, but they seem to be playing in addition to, rather than instead of the built-in safety notices, at least in some videos of the phenomenon. Here are some videos with the simulated voice of Musk, along with my transcriptions below each: Hi, this is Elon Musk, and I’d like to personally welcome you to Palo Alto. You know, people keep saying, ‘cancer is bad,’ but have you ever tried being a cancer? It’s fucking awesome. Hi, this is Elon Musk. Welcome to Palo Alto, the home of Tesla engineering. You know, they say money can’t buy happiness, and yeah, okay, I guess that’s true. God knows I’ve tried. But it can buy a Cybertruck, and that’s pretty sick, right? Right? Fuck, I’m so alone. Hi, I’m Elon. Can we be friends? Will you be my friend? I’ll give you a Cybertruck, I promise. Okay, look, you don’t know the level of depravity I would stoop to just for a crumb of approval. One had a guest spot from a soundalike of President Donald Trump, clearly making light of Musk’s close association with Trump: Not Musk:You know, it’s funny, I used to think he was just this dumb sack of shit. But once you get to know him, he’s actually pretty sweet and tender and loving. Not Trump:Sweetie, come back to bed. One video published byPalo Alto Onlinefeatured this quote, spoken by a faked Zuckerberg’s voice: Hey, it’s Zuck here. I just want to tell you how very proud I am of everything we’ve been building together. From undermining democracy to cooking our grandparents’ brains with AI slop, to — to making the world less safe for trans people. Nobody does it better than us, and, uh, and I think that’s pretty neat. Zuck out! Otherwise, the other simulated Zuckerberg voice messages I found in videos online all had the same content: Hi, this is Mark Zuckerberg, but real ones call me ‘the Zuck.’ You know, it’s normal to feel uncomfortable or even violated as we forcefully insert AI into every, every facet of your conscious experience. And I just want to assure you, you don’t need to worry, because there’s absolutely nothing you can do to stop it. Anyway, see ya.

    "article_text": "Smartphones and other devices exempt from Trump’s April 9th tariffs will be lumped in with semiconductor duties. Smartphones and other devices exempt from Trump’s April 9th tariffs will be lumped in with semiconductor duties. byWes Davis Smartphones, laptops, and other products that are exempt from Trump’s April 9th tariffs will be lumped in with duties on semiconductors in “a month or two,” Commerce Secretary Howard LutnicktoldABC Newsanchor Jonathan Karl onThis Week. Yesterday, the Trump administrationreleased updated guidancethat excluded smartphones, laptops, and more from Trump’s new tariffs, including the 125 percent additional levy on Chinese-produced goods last week. “This is not like a permanent sort of exemption,” Lutnick told Karl, saying that they will be subject later to “a special focus type of tariff” applied to the semiconductor industry, similar toautomotive tariffs Trump has already issued. When asked if the new tariffs will include products like iPhones, many of which are built in China, Lutnick said that’s “correct” and that the goal is to “encourage them to reshore, to be built in America.” ”It’s not like you can open a factory tomorrow to build iPhones,” Karl said, before asking if these coming tariffs will mean higher prices for goods in the US. Lutnick responded: I don’t necessarily think so. I think the idea is that we can manufacture here in America. As I said, there’s a — I saw Panasonic, the battery company. Right? A Japanese company. They built an amazing factory in Kansas, which they’re opening now. They were putting it in the ground when Donald Trump was President, just finishing now.

    "title": "How the Switch 2 compares to the ROG Ally",
    "article_text": "Nintendo’s new handheld attempts to be a PC with its mouse-like controls, but the ROG Ally is more versatile. Nintendo’s new handheld attempts to be a PC with its mouse-like controls, but the ROG Ally is more versatile. byCameron Faulkner If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. TheNintendo Switch 2has entered the ring, possibly complicating your decision of which handheld to buy this year. While Nintendo’s new console, which comes out on June 5th, may seem similar to handheld gaming PCs like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally, there’s a lot that sets them apart. Everything like how you buy and play games, their control methods, how powerful they are, and how you can expand their storage makes them different. Unique doesn’t always mean “good,” by the way. While tech-savvy folks likely understand the key differences between each of the major handhelds, possibly enough to establish a preference, some could use a hand breaking things down. That’s exactly what I’m going to do here, specifically comparing the Switch 2 to theAsus ROG Allyand theAlly X, two of the most popular handheld gaming PCs that aren’t a Steam Deck (in small part because they’re easy to buy atBest Buy). I’ve alreadycompared the Switch 2 to Valve’s console, so my focus here is exclusively on Asus’ consoles that have a dedicated fanbase and some great specs. As mentioned, the Switch 2 will launch on June 5th. Preorders were initially set to begin on April 9th, but were pushed due to the Trump administration’s global tariffs. While that situation remains in flux, it’s possible that preorders will have begun (or will soon), depending on when you read this. Assuming no changes from tariffs, the Switch 2 will be available in two pricing configurations, each with 256GB of internal storage; the $449.99 base console and a $499.99 bundle that also includesMario Kart World. The Asus ROG Ally is available in multiple configurations, most of which are discounted regularly (sometimessteeply, but for the purposes of this post, I’m going to share original retail prices). It starts at $499.99 and features the AMD Ryzen Z1 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage, while electing for the more powerful version with the Z1 Extreme APU (and no other spec improvements) bumps the price up to $649.99. The ROG Ally X has so many improvements that it might as well be the ROG Ally 2 — and you’ll pay a premium for them. We’ll go into more detail below, but pricing starts at $799.99 for the Z1 Extreme model with 24GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, and a bigger battery. Doubling the storage to 2TB adds $100, totaling $899.99. The Switch 2 and all Asus ROG Ally models (even the Ally X) have some specs in common. They each have 1080p LCD touchscreens with a 120Hz refresh rate. However, Nintendo’s handheld has a larger screen (7.9 inches to 7 inches, respectively). The Switch 2’s screen goes toe-to-toe with the Ally X with variable refresh rate (VRR), which is a great feature to have — and quite the shock to have it in the sub-$500 Switch 2 — as it prevents the screen from displaying choppiness as the frame rate fluctuates. While the Ally and Ally X feature AMD’s FreeSync Premium, the Switch 2 has a G-Sync display and HDR. Nintendo hasn’t shared the peak brightness for the Switch 2’s screen yet, but the ROG Ally models go up to 500 nits. The ROG Ally — and especially the ROG Ally X — offer some of the best performance of any handheld gaming PCs on the market. While one might think its Z1 Extreme processor is getting long in the tooth, it debuted in 2023, it’s faster than the Steam Deck, and more capable than the Z2 Go that failed to impress us in its 2025 debut device, the Lenovo Legion Go S. You’ll get the best performance in the pricey ROG Ally X (letThe Verge’s Sean Hollister show you some game-by-game frames per second breakdownsin his review), thanks to its faster memory and more efficient cooling compared to the standard ROG Ally. But even the more affordable models offer a more-than-acceptable baseline, running many popular games at over 60 frames per second at 720p, and in some cases, at 1080p. Several titles can run above 100 frames per second. The ROG Ally runs at higher power levels than the Steam Deck, yet it’s unclear whether that’s the case for the Nintendo Switch 2 as well. Nintendo is promising up to 120 frames per second with some Switch 2-exclusive titles that offer performance modes, but we’ll have to wait and see what kinds of visual compromises were made to achieve such a rare feat for a handheld. The Switch 2 differs drastically from the ROG Ally models because of its custom Nvidia processor. While exact spec details about this Nvidia processor are slim, Nvidia has confirmed that the Switch 2 supports DLSS (Nvidia’s graphics upscaling tech), which will likely be leaned on to achieve fast frame rates in games at 1080p resolution in handheld mode and at up to 4K while the console is docked. We’re curious how DLSS looks in a low-powered device (the also-Nvidia-powered Switch from 2017 predated DLSS’ existence). For comparison, the ROG Ally supports AMD’s comparable FSR upscaling tech, though the integration sometimes results in a fuzzy-looking image. In terms of battery life, Sean Hollister was left wanting more out of the ROG Ally consoles. While its 40Wh capacity matches the Steam Deck, it spends its battery reserve faster, even in low power modes. Hollister said in his ROG Ally review that four hours of battery life was the best case scenario compared to the Steam Deck’s seven. A lot was improved on in the ROG Ally X, beyond its impressively large 80Wh internal battery. Hollister reports that the Ally X is less power-hungry than the original, letting you game for longer. Nintendo is currently being cagey about battery specs in the Switch 2, only sharing that it contains a 5,220mAh lithium-ion battery. It advertises battery life ranging from two to six and a half hours, depending on the game. It’s a little strange to talk about joysticks in the performance section, but the ROG Ally models feature Hall effect joysticks, while theSwitch 2 does not. Those operate with magnetized mechanisms instead of potentiometers, allowing the sticks to not wear down over time, leading to worsening performance and inaccurate inputs. Given the controversy surrounding Nintendo’s Joy-Con drift, we’re surprised and disappointed that Nintendo opted not to go with Hall-effect sticks. Both the Switch 2 and ROG Ally models use fast internal storage, albeit different types. The Switch 2 features 256GB of UFS storage (non-upgradeable), and can be expanded with microSD Express cards, which are classified as PCIe 3.0 NVMe SSDs but have the same microSD card form factor many of us are accustomed to. The standard ROG Ally includes an M.2-2230 SSD (user-replaceable), but you’ll need toopen it upto replace it. This maneuver won’t void your warranty, but it’snot as simple as you might hope. For something simpler, the ROG Ally supports microSD cards, including UHS-II versions with faster read and write speeds. The latter can be expensive and tough to find in stock, so I recommend going the SSD upgrade route if you really want more storage. One of the many improvements in the ROG Ally X is the support for M.2-2280 SSDs, full-size M.2 SSDs that aren’t shrunk down to fit into tiny gadgets. Those SSDs are much easier to find in large storage capacities (and are often discounted), so it’s a bonus that the ROG Ally X supports them as well as microSD cards. Moving on to docking, the Switch 2 and the ROG Ally were both designed as hybrid consoles that can be enjoyed as a handheld, or by linking up to an external screen. Docking is more core to the Switch 2 experience, just as it was with the original Switch, since Nintendo includes a TV dock with the console. With it, you can game at up to 4K resolution, capped at 60 frames per second over HDMI. The dock is low-frills, containing an Ethernet port, a USB-C power plug, an HDMI port, and two USB-A 2.0 ports. None of the ROG Ally consoles include a dock (only a 65W USB-C power adapter), though Asus makes one that’s similar in execution to the Genki Covert Dock. It’s a 65W power brick with an HDMI 2.0 port to connect to a display, and one USB-A 2.0 port for connecting an accessory. It costs $64.99 throughBest Buy, but you’re better off getting something cheaper onAmazonfrom JSAUX or Anker, both of which make docks that rival the official Steam Deck docking station in terms of ports. Of course, if you’re rolling in it, feel free to buy theROG XG Mobile external GPUthat doubles as a docking station. It plugs into the ROG Ally’s proprietary port on the top, and it’s the cost of a high-end gaming laptop. I don’t recommend it because it’s super expensive, and yet, you’ll be bottlenecked by the speed of the ROG Ally’s Ryzen Z1 APU. The ROG Ally X dropped support for the XG Mobile. The Switch 2 and ROG Ally have some games in common. Many games coming to the Switch 2 in 2025 are already out on PC, includingCyberpunk 2077,Split Fiction,Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, and more (and are sometimes discounted, no less). But how you buy games on them is different, and that comes down to the software. While the Switch 2 is limited to titles on the eShop, the ROG Ally runs Windows 11. As such, you’re free to install any game platform available on that OS. That includes Steam, the Epic Games Store, Ubisoft Connect, and others. Games are more affordable on PCs (the ROG Ally is a PC, despite its handheld form factor). While the ability to run any game from any platform is one of Windows’ biggest advantages against the Switch 2 (and compared to the Steam Deck, as well), there are downsides. Namely, Windows 11 isn’t a great experience for handhelds, as the OS doesn’t adapt well to the built-in controls and touchscreen. On the other hand, connecting a mouse and keyboard? That’s another story. The Asus ROG Ally will be among the first handhelds not made by Valve to be supported by official SteamOS in anupdate coming soon. The Switch 2 has a special mouse mode, for which developers are creating control schemes. Games that support it will allow you to play with standard controls, then seamlessly switch to mouse-based controls when the player turns the Joy-Con 2 so that its sensor faces a hard surface. It’s intriguing, but ROG Ally players aren’t missing out on much because they can connect a wireless mouse to play their favorite games.

    "title": "Wool, water, Wi-Fi: Modernizing an ancient business at the final frontiers of e-commerce",
    "article_text": "At Tumar, women in Kyrgyzstan are bringing together ancient nomadic felting techniques, Soviet machinery, and modern tech to build a new kind of business. At Tumar, women in Kyrgyzstan are bringing together ancient nomadic felting techniques, Soviet machinery, and modern tech to build a new kind of business. byAlexandra Marvar One night in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, a felting artisan ended her day with a prayer.May our partners have good health. May they be ambitious, and successful, and may their businesses grow.The next morning, sisters-in-law Chinara Makashova and Nazgul Esenbaeva, and the people they worked with awoke to what seemed like a miracle: Shopify orders. So many Shopify orders. They got to work. It felt like everything was falling into place: The company they had built from scratch was exporting felted slippers and artisan products to wholesale partners around the globe. And with help from USAID’s green business initiative in Central Asia, they were expanding their production abilities — and finally building their own modern, direct-to-consumer web store: one with the payment processing and data security infrastructure to help them reach customers directly. But just as their new ecommerce infrastructure was coming together,the USAID funding vanished around the world— leaving them with a $35,000 funding gap. In so many places, the internet makes building a retail business easy — but in the world’s most land-locked country, with a banking system bogged down by sanctions against one neighbor and cybersecurity barriers against another, growth is a balancing act. Tumar’s path has been unconventional: bringing together nomadic tradition, Soviet legacy, and digital commerce to build a modern business, even when the infrastructure around them can’t keep up. Their first challenge: scaling a 5,000-year-old process that had never before been automated, with machines salvaged from the collapse of the USSR. For centuries, Kyrgyz nomads on the Eurasian steppe drove their flocks from the low green valleys to the snowy slopes of the Tian Shan mountains, sheared their sheeps’ lush thick wool, and used heat, water, and friction to felt it into the durableshyrdakblankets that lined their yurts. Felt may have been the world’s first-ever textile. It was strong, dense, and durable. It could stand up to bitter cold or pouring rain. But between industrialization and the pressure, under Soviet rule, to abandon the past, Kyrgyz wet felting by hand almost disappeared. In fact this particular felting tradition was just a few farflung elders and hidden artifacts from extinction in the 1990s when some women in Bishkek, graduating from university into a post-Soviet world, began to seek out,re-learn, and revivethe practice. Makashova and Esenbaeva — with help from Makashova’s aunt Roza — learned how to use this millennia-old technique of wet felting with Kyrgyz wool to make things like shyrdaks andkalpakhats. In 1998, they started Tumar Art Group. Within a decade, Tumar had its first wholesale partner. And in recent years,USAID-funded programs helped them share their knowledge with women throughout Central Asia, reviving an ancient industry while spurring a new economy. Today, Tumar’s Bishkek facility is a labyrinth of sunlit workspaces, some with pastel floor tiles, some with geraniums lining the windowsills, one full of old jelly jars and coffee containers full of pigments and dyes. Workers pull giant, fluffy sheets of “pre-felt” off the conveyor belt of a wool carding machine. On a switchboard that looks like a Cold War rocket launch interface, they toggle dials that are labeled in Chinese, with hand-scrawled Cyrillic translations taped above. These days, modern, commercial felting operations use a water-free needle-felting process, Makashova explained. Some incorporate glue or synthetic fibers. But not here. Tumar’s engineering team hacked their way to avoiding all that, leveraging their custom manufacturing line to automate processes like carding (aligning the fibers), or kneading, done with a one-of-a-kind “beating machine.” “We take care to keep our traditional technology of wet felting,” Makashova said. But “for the most complicated process of wet pressing, modern engineering does not offer machines, so we have to look for old Soviet schemes, adapt and make these machines ourselves — or restore old machines.” To make one of their most in-demand products — felted slippers — they needed a heavy metal tub to hold water and heat, and flywheels that could apply consistent rhythmic pressure and agitation to the wool. An old Soviet wool milling machine would have done the trick. “Unfortunately,” Makashova said, “they are almost impossible to find.” With scant financial resources and an economy in upheaval, it was hard for this start-up to find, acquire, and ship in the machines they needed — in part because some of those machines didn’t yet exist: Kyrgyz hand felting had never before been automated. Makashova’s brother, an automotive engineer, organized the group’s own small “mechanization base,” collecting, first, Soviet tools and metalworking machines. Gradually, the company acquired textile processing equipment from Italy, China, Russia, and beyond, salvaging, renovating, retrofitting, and Frankensteining equipment to bring automation to an ancient craft. Then, more good fortune arrived: A Tumar associate found a tub and flywheels in “a heap of scrap metal intended for recycling,” Makashova recalled. The company’s engineering group restored the find, “and now we can’t imagine our work without these machines.” As of the 2010s, Tumar was working more with wholesale partners around the world while continuing to make goods for their brick-and-mortar shop of the same name, on a sunny corner in central Bishkek, popular with tourists and expats. By the late 2010s, the global market for sustainable, natural materials was on an upswing, and travelers coming through their Bishkek shop took notice, including a guy in Richmond, Virginia named Barclay Saul. He loved that you could see Tumar’sentire supply chain, from field to factory, in a day, and in the exploding landscape of eco-conscious “Instagram brands,” he and a partner decided to launch Kyrgies out of a Richmond storage space, and sell the slippers online. In spring of 2020, when tourism came to a halt, Tumar’s bustling retail business did too. Saul’s bet was a smart one:Kyrgies’ sales surged. People were staying home — and they wanted the right footwear for it. But they also wanted natural materials. “This business has taught me simply that [people want to] buy less stuff, quality stuff,” Kyrgies CEO Saul said. Kyrgies’ ecommerce business has continued to double year over year, enabling Tumar to double its staff and scale their output fourfold in the past five years. This is the dream, Chinara said — but there’s one dream they still haven’t been able to manifest in the reality of today’s complicated internet: their own web store. The sale of artisan goods out of the Bishkek storefront is still, in some ways, the most important thing they do, said Makashova. It’s just a quarter of their revenue, but it’s a source for their product innovation. Thanks to platforms like Shopify, Kyrgies could launch their retail business in the US virtually overnight. But for a Kyrgyzstan-based business, online retail is no easy feat. The cost of shipping by air or land from the heart of Central Asia is the first hurdle. And another thing: There’s no PayPal here. Payment systems, Makashova said, are “a very, very big problem.” Still today, Kyrgyzstan’s banking system is closely tied to Russia’s, and Westernsanctionsput in place after Putin’s invasion ofCrimeahave made cross-border transactions tricky. Some Kyrgyz banks,waryof being blacklisted, have cut off connections to Russian-linked payment systems, and that’s left companies like Tumar in a lurch. Another wrinkle: With growing concerns over China’s access to US consumer data, platforms handling payments in countries near China — neighboring Kyrgyzstan included — are subject to serious cybersecurity hurdles. And if a payment doesn’t go through on the first attempt, often, there won’t be a second attempt. “We’ve lost many customers for this reason,” Esenbaeva said. All this to say, Tumar’s old-school web store quickly became obsolete. They figured out they needed to rebuild their site with ISO 27001-compliant back-end infrastructure: encryption protocols, secure socket layers, and a payments gateway capable of navigating cross-border compliance from Central Asia, all in hopes of keeping international customers (and the cybersecurity platforms that protect them) from getting scared out of the purchase flow. As of January 2025, the entire plan was in place. A new website was launched. They had the money in hand to build out the direct-sale infrastructure. But there was just one catch: The project was being financed by agreen businessgrant from the now gutted and shuttered USAID. Tumar is hoping that enrolling in Estonia’s e-Residency program will pull their plans for modern, global payment processing out of a death spiral — but they still have about a $35,000 international funding gap to fill with USAID’s dissolution. On the outskirts of Bishkek, at Tumar’s new wool processing facility, the “break yurt” feels like a step back in time. Workers drink black tea and snack on puffy little squares of fried dough with clotted cream and jam. Right next door, a more modern scene unfolds: sun pours through the oculus in the yurt’stundukdome roof onto architectural drawings unfurled on a conference table. Shelves of binders and spiral-bound notebooks lean against the richly colored,shyrdak-lined walls. A flat-bed all-in-one printer, reminiscent of HP circa 2010 — whirs. A similar-vintage, thick-bezeled, matte-black computer monitor and keyboard set-up peeks out from piles of print-outs, a glue stick, an old calculator. At this new factory, some 100 tons per year of course wool that would have been burned as waste is instead being cleaned and processed. More USAID green business support had been on the way — and it would’ve helped Tumar double the output. Now, they may be on their way to accomplishing that on their own, expanding their product line to include, for example, an entirely biodegradable slipper, and soundproofing and insulation panels (both “no-waste” products made, in part, from slipper scraps). And, importantly to the founders, reliable stocks of high quality raw material that other businesses across the region haven’t previously had access to. Across a stretch of grass from the side-by-side yurts, the warehouse is abuzz with activity. “We want to open [up] possibilities [for] artisans to get new direct online orders,” and to learn how to maintain quality and consistency as output increases, Makashova said. And the only way they can do it is to keep growing. There are workshops and small businesses across Central Asia waiting for this raw material to come their way, Esenbaeva said. That means—aside from their own production of felted goods—they’re needing to expand their partnerships with small, family-owned Kyrgyz sheep farms, and increase their capacity for processing wholesale felt. To make it all happen, they’ll need to keep collecting—and building—machines. Esenbaeva laughed, quoting Antoine de Saint-Exupéry: “We are responsible for those we tame.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

Apple is planning more multitasking and windowing features for its tablets. byWes Davis By the time Apple releases M5-powered iPads, using iPadOS may feel closer to working on a Mac, according toBloomberg’s Mark Gurman intoday’sPower Onnewsletter. It won’t be macOS running on a tablet, but he writes that the changes will be significant enough to make people who want such a thing happy. Updates to iPadOS coming this year will be focused “on productivity, multitasking and app window management — with an eye on the device operating more like a Mac,” according to Gurman. He says these changes are due “about a year” after the release of the M4 iPad Pro, afantastic tabletwith far more power than its software demands. Gurman’s report doesn’t give any indication of what Apple’s updated multitasking will look like, and it’s best to reserve any excitement until we see more. Back in 2022, Appleadded Stage Manager to iPadOS 16, a feature that enables windowing and also groups app windows together in a dock-like collection on the side of the display. It might have seemed like an exciting change if you wanted to be able to ditch your MacBook, but what shipped felt too half-hearted to be a useful step in the direction of a proper desktop operating system. Apple hasiterated since, for instance by letting users resize windows more freely in iPadOS 17, but the approach is still much more iPad than Mac. That’s not necessarily a problem on its own unless you’re the type who wants to replace your MacBook with an Apple tablet. We’ll see how much the company moves the needle on that when itunveils iPadOS 19 in June.

    "article_text": "Old seatbelts, truck tarps, and plastic bottles transformed into a very good carryall. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. byThomas Ricker If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. I remember the day: a sinewy bicycle messenger skillfully weaved through honking automobiles and came to a stop at the traffic light in front of me. But instead of dropping a foot, he balanced high above his fixed-gear pedals for nearly a minute, his crossbody bag bulging against the urgent deliveries within. That was ‘90s San Francisco, whenanyone could tap into that free-wheelin’ zeitgeistby wearing a messenger bag — only conformist dorks wore backpacks. Switzerland-based Freitag got its start in 1993 with messenger bags, and it’s keeping that spirit alive with its latest, theF685 Henry. It’s heavy, water resistant, and incredibly durable because it’s made from worn seatbelts, recycled plastic bottles, andused tarps that act as walls on European trucks. That means no two Freitag bags are identical in a world of mass-produced homogeny. Ironically, Freitag bags are built to last despite being made from trash. A Freitag messenger bag that I purchased almost 20 years ago is still my go-to for errands around town. I expect the same longevity from the Henry, which I’ve been testing as an all-purpose gear bag for the last few weeks. That makes its $330 price point a bit more agreeable, as does its generous three-yearrepair warrantyafter registering your purchase. 8 Verge Score Made from old semitrucks, seatbelts, and bottlesWeatherproof and expandable carryallEvery bag is uniqueThree-year warranty So much noisy, scratchy VelcroMaterial needs time to loosen upHeavy for its size Freitag’s F685 Henry is a 13-liter messenger bag that can be expanded to 20 liters, giving it enough volume to function as a daily carryall. So that’s how I’ve been testing it while walking and bicycling to shops, the gym, train, and coworking space. Like all Freitag bags, the company leans heavily into Velcro fasteners and buckles to hold all that tarp together. There’s so much of the stuff that opening the main compartment makes a loud gutturalSHHHRRRRRIIIIIIIIPthat will surely draw attention at a meeting or get you kicked out of the theater. I hate that Velcro sound, and the hook and loop material tears at clothing and collects loose bits of debris over time. But this brute-force closure certainly jibes with the Freitag aesthetic. Closing the heavy-duty buckles adds percussion to the performance. The thing I love about the Henry — and all messenger bags — is how easily the padded shoulder strap allows the bag to be swung around to the front. With the stiff top material foldedjust right— something that comes with practice — a little shoulder sashay let me easily access the two outer pockets, one of which is zippered and contains a key lanyard. Another zippered side pocket allows for quick access to a wallet or phone. You can also secure the bag against your body with a three-point strap. This worked very well, but it isn’t really needed on Amsterdam’s protected bike lanes, where I don’t have to dodge in and out of cars. The bag is accented with reflectors from recycled truck contour markings, which help with visibility at night. Here, I’ll let Freitag show off the bag’s features because its no-nonsense, just-the-facts marketing is part of the company’s charm. As a gear bag, the Henry works best with the addition of your own camera cubes and pouches to keep things organized. Otherwise, everything will jumble together inside the main pocket. The laptop sleeve offers a modicum of padding for protection against bumps, but not enough for me to toss the bag down when I return home — I gently place it on the floor, instead. There’s plenty of webbing to clip on or tie down items around the bag for external carry. That includes carrying a U-lock through the belts on the outer flap, for example, or a yoga mat secured underneath with integrated straps. Fortunately, all the bag’s dangly straps can be stowed inside an external sleeve on the bottom for a cleaner look. The biggest drawback to the Henry is the stiffness and weight. Most of the bag is constructed of a tough polyester fabric created from recycled PET bottles. If it’s like my own basic Freitag messenger, then that material will become malleable over time, but the weight is ever-present. Empty, the Henry tips the scales at 3.26 pounds, which is only a few ounces heavier than the much larger45L versionofPeak Design’s Outdoor Backpack. I don’t mind the weight if it translates into longevity, and the bag’s already starting to loosen up with regular use. And compared to my own Freitag, this bag is stout, which should translate into better protection for your expensive gadgets. Freitag tells me that messenger bags make up just 30 percent of its current sales but have recently returned to growth. Perhaps they’re being purchased by people in platform shoes, chokers, andother ‘90s fashion that has recently returned? Great. Because messenger bags are excellent carryalls and the Freitag F685 Henry is a very good messenger bag… if you’re okay with Velcro.

    "title": "Rory McIlroy wins Masters playoff to complete career Grand Slam",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 13, 2025 / 7:58 PM EDT/ AP Rory McIlroy turned another major collapse into his grandest moment of all, hitting a wedge into 3 feet for birdie in a sudden-death playoff Sunday to finally win the Masters and take his place in golf history as the sixth player to claim the career Grand Slam. What should have been a coronation for McIlroy along the back nine at Augusta National turned into a heart-racing, lead-changing jaw-dropping finish at golf's greatest theater that ended with McIlroy on his knees sobbing with joy and disbelief. \"I started to wonder if it would ever be my time,\" McIlroy said in Butler Cabin before Scottie Scheffler helped him into the green jacket. It ended with more heartache for Justin Rose, who lost to Sergio Garcia in a playoff in 2017 and forced this one with a clutch 20-foot birdie on the 18th hole for a 6-under 66. He wound up joining Ben Hogan as the only players to lose twice in playoffs at Augusta National. McIlroy lost a two-shot lead in two holes at the start. He lost a four-shot lead on the back nine in a matter of three holes with shocking misses, one of them a wedge into the tributary of Rae's Creek on the par-5 13th. And right when it looked as though he would blow another major, McIlroy delivered two majestic shots when nothing less would do, two birdies that sent him to the 18th hole with a one-shot lead. That still wasn't enough. He missed a 5-foot par putt for a 1-over 73 and the first Masters playoff in eight years. McIlroy's wedge bounced onto the slope of the top shelf with enough spin to trickle down to 3 feet. And when Rose missed from 15 feet, McIlroy finally sealed it. McIlroy went 11 long years without a major, knowing the Masters green jacket was all that kept him from joining Tiger Woods, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Ben Hogan and Gene Sarazen as the only winners of golf's four professional majors. He raised both arms and let the putter fall behind him, and before long he was on his knees, then his forehead on the 18th green as his chest heaved with emotion. So ended one of the wildest Sundays at a major that is known for them. U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, who beat McIlroy at Pinehurst No. 2 last June, had the lead after two holes when McIlroy opened with a double bogey. He crashed out with a pair of three-putts and two shots into the water on the back nine, closing with a 75. Ludvig Aberg, a runner-up in his Masters debut a year ago, suddenly had a share of the lead when McIlroy fell apart on the middle of the back nine. He missed a birdie putt from the fringe to take the lead, then finished bogey-triple bogey. Rose had every reason to believe he threw away his chances on Saturday with a 75 that put him seven shots behind, and then two bogeys on the front nine. Even as he steadied himself, he was four shots back and running out of time. He did his part in a 10-birdie round and that dynamic birdie putt to cap it off. McIlroy helped in a big way. Nothing was more shocking than the 13th. McIlroy played it safe, leaving himself a big target and a lob wedge. He missed his mark by some 20 yards, the ball disappearing into the tributary of Rae's Creek and leading to double bogey. Then came a tee shot into the pine straw that led to another bogey, and the lead was gone again. But he was resilient as ever —   he's been like that his entire career. Seemingly in trouble left of the 15th fairway, McIlroy hit 7-iron around the trees and onto the green to 6 feet. He missed the eagle putt - the birdie still helped him regain a share of the lead. Two holes later, facing a semi-blind shot, he drilled 8-iron and chased after it, urging it to \"Go! Go! Go! Go!\" And it did, barely clearing the bunker and rolling out to 2 feet for birdie and a one-shot lead. Turns out that wasn't enough either. He hit into a bunker from the fairway. He missed the 5-foot putt for the win. There was more work to do. But the 35-year-old from Northern Ireland never wavered in what he came to Augusta National to do. He leaves with a green jacket. © 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Copyright ©2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy: The 2025 60 Minutes Interview transcript",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 13, 2025 / 7:52 PM EDT/ CBS News The Ukrainian president faces a critical moment in his alliance with the United States. In an interview this past Friday, Volodymyr Zelenskyy invited President Trump, here, to Ukraine, to see how Russia's unprovoked invasion, three years ago, continues to threaten the peace of the Western world. Zelenskyy is navigating a sharp turnabout in Washington. The United States had been leading nato in arming Ukraine and isolating Russia. but since taking office, President Trump has praised the Russian dictator Vladimir Putin and criticized Zelenskyy. this past Friday, a Trump official met Putin in Russia about the same time we sat down with Zelenskyy in his hometown. It had been a week since Russia killed 9 children on a playground. Scott Pelley: You seem to have a real hatred of Vladimir Putin. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (Translated): Putin? 100% hatred. Not even 99.9%. Though this doesn't mean we shouldn't work to end the war as soon as possible and transition to diplomacy. But how else can you see a person who came here and murdered our people, murdered children? We're inside a school bomb shelter right now. The bomb shelter of a school. The bomb shelter classrooms beneath the city of Kryvyi Rih were silent. School 41 was mourning its students killed on April 4. Swing sets pierced by shrapnel stood where Zelenskyy laid his memorial to the nine children and 10 others cut down by a Russian missile. He asked us to look at their faces and told us that while the great powers endlessly debate war and peace, these children will never speak again. Scott Pelley: Mr. President, what does an atrocity like this tell you about the progress of the war? President Volodymyr Zelenskyy: It means that we can't trust Russia. We can't trust negotiations with Russia. Russia strikes Ukrainian cities daily. 1,700 attacks on schools, 600 children dead. 780 hospitals and clinics attacked. 13,000 civilians killed. And up to 100,000 Ukrainian soldiers dead, all for Vladimir Putin's vanity war to expand Russia to NATO's doorstep. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (Translated):Our people have paid the highest price possible. There is no higher price. We have given all our money--all we have in terms of finances. But most important, we gave [the lives of] our people. Those were the points Zelenskyy struggled to make in February as President Trump opened negotiations with Russia and, initially, excluded Ukraine. Then, Trump rewrote history, saying, falsely, that Ukraine had started the war and calling the democratically elected Zelenskyy... President Trump on February 19: A dictator without elections. Zelenskyy better move fast or he's not going to have a country left. Gotta move, gotta move fast 'cause that war is going in the wrong direction. Scott Pelley: When President Trump called you a dictator and said that Ukraine started this war, what did you think? President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (Translated): I believe, sadly, Russian narratives are prevailing in the U.S. How is it possible to witness our losses and our suffering, to understand what the Russians are doing, and to still believe that they are not the aggressors, that they did not start this war? This speaks to the enormous influence of Russia's information policy on America, on U.S. politics, and U.S. politicians. Trump in Oval Office meeting with Zelenskyy: You're not in a good position, you don't have the cards right now. And Zelenskyy told us he heard Russia's narrative from Trump officials in that disastrous Oval Office meeting in February. Trump in Oval Office meeting with Zelenskyy:You're gambling with World War III. Zelenskyy grew tense as President Trump said both sides were suffering, Ukraine's people and the Russian invasion force. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (Translated): It's a shift in tone, a shift in reality, really yes, a shift in reality, and I don't want to engage in the altered reality that is being presented to me. First and foremost, we did not launch an attack [to start the war]. It seems to me that the Vice President is somehow justifying Putin's actions. I tried to explain, \"You can't look for something in the middle. There is an aggressor and there is a victim. The Russians are the aggressor, and we are the victim.\" Vice President Vance suggested that Putin could be trusted and it was Zelenskyy who was creating a false narrative. Zelenskyy in Oval Office meeting: Have you ever been to Ukraine that you see what problems we have? Come once. Vance in Oval Office meeting: I've actually, I've actually watched and seen the stories and I know what happens is you bring people, you bring them on a propaganda tour, Mr. President. Scott Pelley: Would you invite President Trump to Ukraine? President Volodymyr Zelenskyy: With pleasure. Please. This, Zelenskyy apparently wanted President Trump to hear in English. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy: We want you to come, and I think to come and to see. You think you understand what's going on here. Okay, we respect your position. You understand. But, please, before any kind of decisions, any kind of forms of negotiations, come to see people, civilians, warriors, hospitals, churches, children destroyed or dead. Come, look, and then let's -- let's move with a plan how to finish the war. You will understand with whom you have a deal. You will understand what Putin did. And we will not prepare anything. It will not be theater, with preparing actors in the streets and the [city] center. We don't do this. We don't need it. You can go exactly where you want, in any city which been under attacks. What I said to them, just to come and to understand. With his invitation on its way, he switched to Ukrainian. Scott Pelley: Does the United States have your back? President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (Translated): (PAUSE) Even in this pause of mine there's a problem. Because I want to answer truthfully and quickly that the United States is our strategic, strong partner. But the pause is doubt. I don't doubt that thepeopleof America are with us. But in a long war, many details are forgotten. In Europe everyone fears that the United States may drift away from Europe. Scott Pelley: Can you do without the United States? President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (Translated):I think without the United States we will suffer great losses. Human and territorial. So, I wouldn't like to consider that. But this isourdestiny, our land, our life. One way or another,wewill end this war. The U.S. has donated about $175 billion in aid. Roughly 100 billion of that was military, most of which was spent in the U.S. on manufacturing American weapons. Scott Pelley: What would you say that the American people have gotten for that money? President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (Translated): We have always believed that this is our shared struggle, that Ukraine is defending our shared values, that we are defending Europe as a whole. I can only thank the people of the United States of America for their support, their strong support. But the people dying right now, with all due respect to the U.S. and Europe, the ones dying right now are Ukrainians. This is why I say that by giving us weapons, other countries are protecting their own people. But in the Trump administration, U.S. aid has all but stopped. Last month the White House announced partial ceasefires, but they haven't happened. And now, Trump says he is losing patience with Putin. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (Translated): Putin can't be trusted. I told that to President Trump many times. So when you ask why the ceasefire isn't working – this is why. Putin never wanted an end to the war. Putin never wanted us to be independent. Putin wants to destroy us completely – our sovereignty and our people. Putin's troops occupy about 20% of Ukraine. The 600-mile front is largely frozen – World War I trench warfare plus drones. It's estimated that as many as 200,000 Russian troops have been killed. Scott Pelley: What does a just peace look like to you? President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (Translated):To not lose our sovereignty or our independence. We, no matter what, will take back what is ours because we never lost it – the Russianstookit from us, the temporarily occupied territories. We will not recognize [as Russia] those territories that the Russians temporarily occupy. We will bring them back. When or how, I cannot say. [But] what we can't bring back are the human [lives]. There's only one thing that can be done, justice. We cannot let go the issue of justice. Those who killed must pay for the murders. Zelenskyy told us any true ceasefire must include a guarantee of Ukrainian security. He imagines an international peacekeeping force and would like the U.S. to be part of it. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (Translated): This could mean a [force] protecting airspace and providing air defense, which may consist of airplanes rather than boots on the ground. Trump in campaign speech: I will end the war in Ukraine immediately I will get it done while I'm president-elect. During his presidential campaign, Trump boasted he would end the war before Inauguration Day. Instead, today, Palm Sunday, Russian missiles struck the Ukrainian city of Sumy — at least 32 civilians are dead, including another 2 children. Scott Pelley: In your view, what is at stake in this moment? President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (Translated): Security. The security of the world is at stake. If we do not stand firm, he will advance further. It is not just idle speculation; the threat is real. Putin's ultimate goal is to revive the Russian Empire and reclaim territories currently under NATO protection. And the United States being part of NATO means it will be involved in any potential conflict. Considering all of this, I believe it could escalate into a world war. Scott Pelley: A risk to the world. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (Translated): Yes, for the world. There won't be a safe place [not a] safe place for [anyone]. Produced by Maria Gavrilovic. Associate Producer Alex Ortiz.

    "title": "How the Savannah Bananas celebrate foster families",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 13, 2025 / 7:46 PM EDT/ CBS News The Savannah Bananas are all about family. Sure, this exhibition baseball team is also about the game. Its players demonstrate incredible athletic ability — tossing their gloves aside and catching pop-ups with their bare hands while performing a backflip, connecting with a pitch and running to first base on stilts, catching balls in the infield and bouncing it between their legs before throwing it to first. But for the Savannah Bananas, the game is about more than the final scoreboard. For them — and the other teams who play the derivation of the game they have branded \"Banana Ball\" — baseball is about bringing together people of all ages and entertaining them. \"There are so few things in life that you can bring multiple generations to and they can connect over,\" said Emily Cole, wife, business partner, and co-owner of the Savannah Bananas with Jesse Cole. \"One of the most fulfilling things for us is hearing from a family that the toddlers came, mom and dad came, and they brought their parents or they brought their in-laws. And they all sat down for a few hours together and connected.\" Banana Ball certainly has found an audience: the games have sold out Major League Baseball stadiums, including Fenway Park in Boston and Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, where they played to a completely sold-out, standing-room-only crowd of 45,000 last fall. In between the action of trick plays on the field, Banana Ball has programming for everyone. Before a pitch is even thrown, the players honor the Banana Baby, a local infant dressed in a banana costume who's lifted aloft while players kneel around and \"The Circle of Life\" plays. During the game, the Banana Nanas showcase grandmas on the field doing choreographed dance routines. As players step up to the plate to bat, their walk-up routines include elaborate lip-synching to artists like Kendrick Lamar, the Village People, and Taylor Swift. Owner Jesse Cole says it is all in service of bringing generations together. In an interview with 60 Minutes correspondent Lesley Stahl, Cole recounted a man who approached him at a recent game. \"He goes, 'You gave me something that my daughter and I can bond over together. you have no idea how much this means to me,'\" Cole recalled the man saying. \"And for me and, you know, with two daughters, you're always trying to find those things you can connect with your daughter.\" The Coles' own family has influenced what they use Banana Ball to put a spotlight on — including foster children. Licensed foster parents themselves, the couple had one biological son when they were called to take in a two-year-old girl. A year later, another call and another placement — this time, a newborn baby girl who had tested positive for illegal substances in her system. \"The goal of foster care is to just walk alongside these kids and these families until they can reunify safely with biological family,\" Emily Cole said. \"So that was always our goal, was to just help these kiddos and welcome them into our family, but then, you know, send them home when time was ready.\" In the Coles' case, the time to reunite the foster children in their care with their biological families never arrived. Jesse and Emily have since permanently adopted both girls. Now, to honor other families who foster kids in need, the Coles have created \"Bananas Foster,\" a nonprofit that celebrates and educates about foster families. At each Banana Ball game, a foster family is called to the field to be recognized. Often, the crowd gives them a standing ovation, recognizing foster parents that are otherwise likely seldom thanked for their work. \"We believe we have a responsibility to just do good things in the world,\" Emily Cole said. \"And of course we're creating joy every night for people, but we know about this need in foster care, and fortunately we have this platform now, that we saw an opportunity to be able to use our platform to talk about something that is a topic in society that's not touched on a lot.\" The video above was produced by Brit McCandless Farmer and edited by Scott Rosann. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "Geologist warns minerals bonanza in Greenland is a mirage",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 13, 2025 / 7:46 PM EDT/ CBS News Greenlandhas likely received more international news attention in the past 90 days than in the previous 90 years. President Trump has been explicit: he wantsAmerica to control Greenland, predicting untold riches for the local population. On March 4, the president directly addressed the people of Greenland during a joint session of Congress. \"We will make you rich, and together, we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before,\" Mr. Trump declared. Although the 57.000 people living in Greenland would no doubt welcome more American investment, their appetite for America taking control of the island, which is currently part of the Kingdom of Denmark,seems limited. A poll from January 2025 shows that only 6% of the predominantly Indigenous Inuit population wants to become American—and this poll was conducted before Mr. Trump refused to rule out using force to acquire Greenland \"one way or the other.\"This statement did not sit well in the capital of Nuuk. Mr. Trump's claim that the U.S. needs Greenland \"for national security and even international security\" is being tested. Danish political scientist Ole Wæver tells 60 Minutes that it doesn't add up. \"You can only get to that conclusion by kind of messing up everything,\" he said. \"Throwing in five, six different military security dynamics and then treating them as one mysterious whole. If you break them up and take them one by one, then you will, for each of them, say, 'That would not change by possessing Greenland.' You either have access already, or it's not a real issue, or someone else is doing it. There are none of those questions where it's really about possessing Greenland.\" The other reason for the Trump administration's proposing the acquisition of Greenland is access to the territory's untapped natural resources. Beneath the snow and ice-covered surface of this vast territory lie valuable resources such as gold, copper, graphite, zinc, and rare earth minerals necessary to power the global economy. Rare earths are particularly needed for producing batteries for electric cars, mobile phones, solar and wind-powered turbines. The argument is that by acquiring Greenland, the U.S. will access a treasure trove of minerals essential for competing with China in the high-stakes, high-tech race for global dominance. It is not only the Trump administration that sees Greenland as an attractive potential acquisition. The British magazineThe Economist, although warning Mr. Trump about forcing his will on the territory, writes that persuading the Greenlanders to become Americans \"could be the deal of the century.\"The Economistpointsto aU.S. Geological Survey report showing the presence of 43 of 50 minerals deemed critical by the US, and a 2008 USGS report that claims that wells on the coast could yield 52 billion barrels of oil. However, Greenlandic geologist Minik Rosing criticizes the interpretation of the report. He says the USGS did not assess Greenland as having oil and gas reserves. \"They said that there is a potential for oil, but there has been oil and gas exploration in Greenland for 50 years, and they haven't found any,\" Rosing said. Rosing, a native Greenlander and professor at the University of Copenhagen, is credited with making life on Earth no less than 300 million years older by discovering a carbon signature in Greenlandic rock formations. He has spent years studying the territory's terrain. He argues that the assumptions about getting rich quickly from untapped resources in Greenland are akin to planning to get wealthy by playing the lottery. The widespread lack of detailed knowledge about geology, mining, and minerals has resulted in, he says, an almost \"mythological misunderstanding\" of what rare earth elements truly are. \"In geology, we say what characterizes rare earths is that they are neither rare nor earth. They are a group of metals that are commonly occurring in many rock types, and there are large known deposits of them throughout the world,\" Rosing explained to 60 Minutes. According to Rosing, nothing points to a special concentration of minerals and rare earths in Greenland, and there are many places in the world where minerals are easier and cheaper to obtain, such as the USA. In the U.S. Geological Survey's overview of known rare earth reserves from 2024, Greenland sits eighth in the table, ranked just behind the US but far behind countries such as China, Vietnam, and Brazil. One mining geologist, who 60 Minutes spoke with on background, says the focus should be more on the quality of the minerals than the quantity. Besides, he says, the U.S. already has many untapped rare earths and minerals in states like California and Alaska. According to Rosing, the reason these resources remain untapped is that mining is often unprofitable. Furthermore, the U.S. lacks the technologies required to refine the raw materials. Almost all the minerals extracted from U.S. soil are sent to China for processing. Notably, the largest U.S. rare earth minerals mine, Mountain Pass in California, is co-owned by the Chinese government-owned firm Shenghe, which holds around 8% of its shares. The issue lies not only in accessing the minerals but also in refining and sourcing them—transforming them into the magnets and batteries necessary for cars, computers, and more. Rosing told 60 Minutes that China primarily dominates this market, and acquiring Greenland will not alter that. \"You don't know if you can sell the product, and you also lack the capacity in either Europe or the US for processing metals and refining them into final products. Furthermore, even the products made from it are often manufactured in China anyway,\" explained Rosing. According to several scientists interviewed by 60 Minutes, the real issue for the West in reducing its reliance on China is not to acquire more territory but to develop facilities for processing raw materials and foster a competitive market. That effort would likely require substantial economic subsidies and political will. \"We can decide if we will pay a premium price to have it produced in our own realm, so to speak. I think that's a main enabler of mining anywhere not specific to Greenland,\" Rosing said. \"How many new mines have been opened in the U.S. or in Europe in the past ten years or 20 years? Very few.\" The Greenlandic geologist is puzzled by why the U.S. believes it needs to acquire Greenland at all. The Greenlandic government has actively sought American investment for over 30 years with limited success. When asked if he thinks the voices in Mr. Trump's inner circle, which boast of a wealth of mineral riches in Greenland waiting to be explored, are similar to fool's gold, Rosing replies, \"To some extent, yes. It is a mirage because it has been described as this very easy access to very rapid wealth. And that is not the case.\" There are only two active mines in Greenland. 60 Minutes visited the Amaroq Gold Mine in the territory's southwest, where the Icelandic CEO, Eldur Olafsson, has taken over a closed mine. With prudent planning and gold prices at all-time highs, Olafsson believes that serious money can be made there. He says that investors have contributed around $250 million to the project, which has so far produced only one gold bar. According to Olafsson, more is on its way, and he estimates that his gold mine alone can yield gold worth $150 million annually. However, it is not a short-term game. \"Our investors need to be long-term investors. They need to be willing to take the risk. They need to understand the opportunity that the mining and infrastructure sector has been underinvested, especially in a country like Greenland, for decades,\" Olafsson said. \"They look at long-term play. And therefore, they need to have the belief, the geological belief, that this is all here. And they need to believe in us that we can actually execute, and that takes time.\" One geologist familiar with the area that 60 Minutes visited was skeptical about the prospects, while Rosing has maintained a more optimistic view of gold mining in Greenland. \"I think it's reasonable, and I think that is a very special case,\" he said. \"And it somehow illustrates what the problem with mining is. A gold mine mines money, there's no problem selling gold.\" The CEO of Amaroq Minerals, the biggest holder of exploration licenses in Greenland, believes their gold mine can be used as a model for mining minerals and rare earths. However, Rosing is more skeptical. \"For all the other metals, you need to have a market. And if that market is completely controlled by, let's say, China, as is the case for most of the critical markets, it's not an open market, so you don't know what the price is,\" Rosing said. \"The problem with rare earth metals is that you cannot just have the ore and extract it and then think that that will give you the metals the next day because the capacity to process the ore, refine the metals, separate them and make them into useful components in the electronics industry is a very, very long one.\" If Rosing is correct, it raises questions about the value of the strategy to acquire Greenland and the mineral deal in Ukraine that the Trump administration is seeking to broker. Nevertheless, the geologist is optimistic about a sustainable mining future in Greenland, emphasizing that Greenlanders generally support mining. \"Greenland is a wonderful place. It is a treasure trove of many things. But it is not a place where money is just sitting in the ground waiting to be picked up. There is no gold there in the streets,\" Rosing said. \"I think that Greenland is a treasure to the world. I mean, it is a fantastic place. It has the only ice sheet in the Northern Hemisphere. It has the narwhals. It has all kinds of wonderful things. And also, it has mineral resources. It is something that, with the right policies and the right planning, can help us be independent of China for the critical minerals. But it needs will, and it needs time.\" The video above was produced by Will Croxton. It was edited by Sarah Shafer. Video of Minik Rosing courtesy of Jakob Gottschau. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "Savannah Bananas: the viral sensation shaking up America's pastime",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 13, 2025 / 7:45 PM EDT/ CBS News Jesse Cole's childhood dreams of playing for his hometown Boston Red Sox ended with a shoulder injury in college. He pivoted to coaching instead. While in the dugout one day, though, Cole realized something: he was bored out of his mind. \"If I'm bored, there's gotta be other people that are probably bored with baseball as well,\" he said. That moment started Cole on the path to creating \"Banana Ball,\" a faster, livelier, more dynamic twist on baseball that's become a huge hit with fans and a viral sensation on social media. Cole first started shaking things up when he became the general manager of the Grizzlies, a failing college summer league team in Gastonia, North Carolina. He started teaching players silly dance routines to perform between innings, and added fun and games for fans. Cole also started wearing a yellow tux, inspired by his idols, showmen P.T. Barnum and Walt Disney. \"It's something I believe in. It's standing out. It's being different. And if your owner is dressed up in a yellow tuxedo, I mean, I think that gives permission to everyone else to not take themselves too seriously, to have fun,\" he said. Cole didn't just bring fun to the Grizzlies; he also brought the team success. According to Cole, they went from among the lowest game attendance in their league, to the fourth best . And they started winning games. . \"We won championships,\" Cole said. \"When you have fun, you play better.\" It was also while working in Gastonia that Cole met the woman who would become his wife.  Emily McDonald worked for the Grizzlies as the team's \"director of fun.\" Cole proposed to her on the Grizzlies' field during a game. In 2015, Jesse and Emily Cole, now newlyweds, launched the Savannah Bananas as a new college summer league team in Savannah, Georgia. The Bananas built a devoted fan base, sold out stadiums, and won titles, but something kept gnawing at Cole: some fans were leaving before the game was over. \"It was eating me up inside,\" Cole said. \"But then I realized that means there's a fundamental problem with the actual game.\" He videotaped the crowd during games and studied the tapes, determined to find out when fans were looking down at their phones and not paying attention. Cole started dreaming up ideas for a faster, more exciting game and all-around fun experience for fans of all ages, even ones who don't already love baseball. \"Obviously, it started from the idea of baseball. But now let's just turn it up a little bit,\" he said. Turning it up Savannah Bananas style means the show starts hours before the game, with fans and players dancing outside the stadium. A team of young gymnasts — the Banana Splitz – perform on the field. There's also a dance team made of grandmas called the Banana Nanas. Instead of traditional cheerleaders, there's a motley crew of men, the Man-Nanas, who the Bananas also call the Dad-Bod Cheering Squad.Before the players take the field, there are crowd warm-ups and silly games to keep fans engaged. \"There's almost 50 things that happen before the game starts,\" Cole said. While the entertainment is scripted, the game itself is a real competition. It's not traditional baseball though – it's Banana Ball. Think baseball, with some rule twists. There is a two-hour time limit. Mound visits are forbidden, and if a fan catches a foul ball, it's an out. There are also no walks. \"Think about this. In a baseball game, there's a play called a walk. It's unathletic. It's called a walk,\" Cole said. \"What would be the exact opposite? A sprint.\" During one of Cole's Banana Ball innovations, the \"Ball 4 sprint,\" the batter takes off running the bases and cannot be tagged out until every fielder has touched the ball. \"So now a walk becomes one of the most exciting plays in sports,\" Cole said. There's also no bunting in Banana Ball. If a player bunts Banana Ball, he's thrown out of the game, Cole said. \"I believe in baseball, Banana Ball, come up and swing the bat. Try to create something really special instead of the bunt,\" Cole said. Trick plays, including in-between-the-leg throws and back flip catches, are encouraged. Banana Ball also features choreographed dances, in which players lip sync to famous songs as they come to the plate to bat. Cole, who also owns the Party Animals — the Savannah Bananas' main rival — needed to find the right mix of players to try out his vision for Banana Ball . Coaches Tyler Gillum and Adam Virant helped create the new game and recruit players to try it out. At first, their exclusive focus was finding strong baseball players. One athlete who came to tryouts, Dakota Albritton, had played high school baseball in his Georgia hometown, then went to work in construction. He was pushing a wheelbarrow full of concrete when he got a call from his mother about the tryouts. She told Albritton she'd signed him up and had even told the team that he was able to walk on stilts. She failed to mention that he hadn't used the stilts in 10 years. He'd gotten them as a Christmas present when he was 10. On the way to tryouts, Albritton realized the straps on the stilts had rotted from lack of use. They stopped at a tractor supply store and bought dog collars, which Albritton used to strap the stilts onto his legs. \"He had played high school baseball. Not the highest level. And he probably wasn't gonna make the team,\" Cole said. \"He said, 'I brought my stilts. Do you want me to wear 'em?' And I said, 'Nuh-uh. Unless you can hit in 'em.'\" Albritton insisted he could. \"I had no idea I could do it, but I wasn't gonna back down from a challenge,\" Albritton said. The entire tryout stopped as Albritton approached the plate on his stilts and then managed to hit the ball, surprising himself just as much as everyone else. The coaches, who were still focused on hiring the very best baseball talent, planned to cut Albritton, until Cole intervened. He reminded them that his vision for Banana Ball was things being done on a baseball field that no one had ever seen. A player batting on stilts could not be passed over. Other players, like RobertAnthony Cruz, joined the Bananas with stronger baseball credentials. He'd been signed by the Washington Nationals, but was released one year later. Savannah Bananas players said they'd all dreamed of playing in the Major Leagues. When that dream didn't work out, they thought they were done playing the sport they loved. They say Banana Ball has offered a second life. They're still practicing traditional baseball skills, plus one-upping each other on trick plays, antics, and on-field dances. Banana Ball players have full-year contracts and are paid significantly more than most minor leaguers. Their salaries have risen every year, as has their fan base. One couple told 60 Minutes they drove 10 hours to come to a game in Savannah. Last season, the Bananas made it to the big leagues, playing in six Major League Baseball stadiums, including Cole's hometown stadium, Fenway Park. Tickets to all six sold out. The Bananas now have more TikTok followers than all 12 of last year's MLB playoff teams combined.Banana Ball is now a multimillion dollar private business. To build fans, Cole reinvests. He keeps ticket prices low — $60 max — and broadcasts all games free on YouTube. This year , Banana Ball has officially become a league, with two more teams: the Firefighters and the Texas Tailgaters. They'll play at 17 MLB stadiums, and also, for the first time, at three NFL stadiums. Those football stadiums, which seat between 65,000 and 75,000 fans each, are already sold out.

    "title": "Bringing wackiness to baseball has been a home run for the Savannah Bananas",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 13, 2025 / 7:44 PM EDT/ CBS News There is something unusual going on in a whole lot of Major League Baseball stadiums this season, and it isn't baseball, well, at least not exactly. It's \"Banana Ball,\" and if you've never heard of it, get ready for something, well.. bananas. It's a classic against-the-odds story, that started with a scrappy college-summer-league baseball team in Savannah, Georgia, lovingly named the Savannah Bananas.. with an unorthodox owner who dreamed of making America's pastime livelier and more fun, with dancing players, trick plays, and non-stop entertainment for the fans. Think Harlem Globetrotters, only more so. Take a look. It looks like baseball and feels like baseball. But then.. there's this -- an umpire feeling the music? A batter on, no, stilts? Gymnastics in the outfield.. and on the way home…. Banana Ball is the creation of Jesse Cole, who dresses in banana yellow daily. He's the owner and ringmaster of this circus. Lesley Stahl: It's not baseball. Or is it baseball? Jesse Cole: Obviously, it started from the idea of baseball. But now let's just turn it up a little bit. \"Turning it up a little bit\" Savannah Bananas-style means the show starts hours before the game, with fans and players dancing outside before the doors open. Then, on the field.. gymnasts, the Banana Splitz; a dance team made up of grandmas, the Banana Nanas; and instead of cheerleaders, these guys, the Man-Nanas. Jesse Cole: It's all intentional. So this is the script. Lesley Stahl: You have a script? Jesse Cole: There's almost 50 things that happen before the game starts. The idea is to have something entertaining for everyone, like this 6-year-old leading a crowd warm-up, to appeal to all ages, baseball fans or not. Lesley Stahl: How long in the car? Woman in crowd: 10 hours. Lesley Stahl: You drove here for 10 hours?! The game itself, between the Bananas and their main Banana Ball rivals, the Party Animals, also owned by Cole, is a real baseball competition, with some rule twists -- there's a 2-hour time limit. No mound visits, no walks or bunts, and if a fan catches a foul ball, it's an out. Trick plays like between-the-leg throws to make an out, and back flip catches, are encouraged. And a few times a game, players go to bat with lip-synched, choreographed productions, like this one featuring infielder Jackson Olson. Lesley Stahl: Longtime baseball writer Tim Kurkjian came to a game. And he said, \"This is the stupidest thing I have ever seen.. I loved it.\" Jesse Cole: So grateful he finished with the, \"I love it.\" Lesley Stahl: Exactly, right but, you know, there are people who would be offended that you're changing baseball. Jesse Cole: I believe if you're not getting criticized, you're playin' it too safe. Safe isn't Jesse Cole's style. His early dreams of playing for his hometown Red Sox ended with a shoulder injury in college that sent him into coaching, and a discovery he wasn't expecting. Jesse Cole: I'm sitting in the dugout and I realized something. I'm bored out of my mind. Jesse Cole:And if I'm bored, there's gotta be other people that are probably bored with baseball as well. He got a job managing a failing college summer league team in Gastonia, North Carolina called the Grizzlies, where he started shaking things up with dancing and silliness. Emily Cole: The first time I saw Jesse, he's the general manager of the team, keep in mind. Emily McDonald was working for a minor league team in Augusta at the time. Emily Cole: He is on the field teaching his players how to do the Thriller dance. Jesse Cole: You've gotta get the arms into it. You've gotta get the head. Lesley Stahl: You said, \"Oh. That guy's for me.\" Emily Cole: Right away– Jesse Cole: --But we nailed that dance. We nailed that dance. Emily joined the Grizzlies. And three years later, joined Jesse, permanently. And yes, he was already wearing that yellow tux, inspired by his idols, showmen P.T. Barnum and Walt Disney. Jesse Cole: It's something I believe in. It's standing out. It's being different. And if your owner is dressed up in a yellow tuxedo, I mean, (LAUGH) I think that gives permission to everyone else to not take themselves too seriously, to have fun. Lesley Stahl: Were you able to turn the Grizzlies around? Jesse Cole: Yeah. From the team that was probably worst in the country in attendance, we climbed up to be fourth in the country in attendance. Lesley Stahl: But what about playing? Jesse Cole: Oh. We won championships. When you have fun, you play better. In 2015, the newlyweds launched the Bananas as a new college-summer-league team in Savannah, building fans with all-you-can-eat food, and always upping the fun. They won titles, but something kept gnawing at Jesse. Some fans were leaving the stadium before the game was over. Lesley Stahl: Even with everything going on? Jesse Cole: It was eating me up inside. But thenI realized that means there's a fundamental problem with the actual game. He began videotaping the crowd and studying. Jesse Cole: When are fans looking at their phones? When are they not paying attention to the game? Mound visits. Batters stepping out, taking forever. Alright, if you step out– Lesley Stahl: Oh, I hate that. Jesse Cole: Yes. Lesley Stahl: And they play with their gloves-- Jesse Cole: And so we said, \"What are all the normal rules of a baseball game? What would be the exact opposite?\" He started dreaming up ideas for a faster, more exciting game. Jesse Cole: Think about this. In a baseball game, there's a play called a walk. It's unathletic. It's called a walk. So we said, What would be the exact opposite? A sprint. And so was born the ball 4 sprint, where the batter takes off and can't be tagged out until every fielder has touched the ball. Jesse Cole: So now a walk becomes one of the most exciting plays in sports. Jesse Cole: And then what about bunting? Now I know this is controversial, but if you bunt in Banana Ball, you're thrown out of the game. There's no– Lesley Stahl: What's wrong with bunting? Jesse Cole: There's no bunting. Lesley Stahl: I like bunting. Jesse Cole: Some traditionalists do. When I came up to the plate the first time as a five-year-old, my dad said, \"Jess, swing hard in case you hit.\" And I believe in baseball, Banana Ball, come up and swing the bat. Try to create something really special instead of the bunt. Adam Virant: So that first tryout.. Coaches Tyler Gillum and Adam Virant helped create the new game and recruit players to try it out. Lesley Stahl: You were looking for really strong baseball players? Adam Virant: Exclusively. Dakota Albritton: I was pushin' a wheelbarrow full of concrete and my phone went off. And-- it was my momma. Dakota Albritton had played high school baseball in his Georgia hometown, then got a job in construction. Dakota Albritton: She said, \"Hey, we got a baseball tryout this weekend. I said, \"Why'd you do that?\" You know? \"I ain't played ball in two years.\" She said, \"Well, I told 'em you could walk on stilts.\" And with me not having any knowledge on what the Bananas was, I asked her again, \"Well, why'd you do that?\" I hadn't done that in 10 years. Lesley Stahl: You hadn't walked on stilts in– Dakota Albritton: I had not– Lesley Stahl: --ten years? Dakota Albritton: --walked on stilts in ten years. They'd been a Christmas present when he was 10. Dakota Albritton: Matter of fact, on the way to tryouts, I realized that the straps that held 'em on my legs were dry rotted, and we stopped by tractor supply and got dog collars that-- They were-- they were held on my leg by-- by dog– Lesley Stahl: Are you– Dakota Albritton: --collars. Lesley Stahl: --serious? Dakota Albritton:[SMILES, NODS] Jesse Cole: He had played high school baseball. Not the highest level. And he probably wasn't gonna make the team. He said, \"I brought my stilts. Do you want me to wear 'em?\" And I said, \"Nuh-uh. Unless you can hit in 'em.\" Dakota Albritton: I said, \"Heck yeah I can.\" I got up there- Lesley Stahl: And you had no idea? Dakota Albritton: I had no idea I could do it, but I wasn't gonna back down from a challenge. Adam Virant: And the entire tryout stops. Lesley Stahl: I wonder why. Adam Virant: It's dead quiet. Lesley Stahl: Did you hit the ball? Dakota Albritton: I did. I surprised myself just as much as I surprised everybody else. The coaches were still going to cut him, 'til Jesse intervened. Adam Virant: Jesse says, \"Guys, you don't see the vision. The vision is things bein' done on a baseball field nobody has ever seen.\" Other players, like RobertAnthony Cruz – RAC for short – joined the Bananas with stronger credentials. He'd been signed by the Washington Nationals. This video of him sharing the news with his dad, went viral. But as with so many players... RobertAnthony Cruz: One year later I got released by the Nationals and-- um my wife and I moved back in with my parents Bananas players told us they'dalldreamed of playing in the major leagues. Lesley Stahl: Raise your hand.[ALL RAISE HANDS] RobertAnthony Cruz: Yeah. Lesley Stahl: When baseball didn't work, did you all think you were done? Voices: Yes. Yeah. Big time. 100%. They say Banana Ball is a second life. They're still practicing thatoldgame, plus one-upping each other on cool tricks and smooth moves. That elaborate batter walk-up routine? Also part of afternoon practice. Jackson Olson: Literally, like, four hours before the game. Lesley Stahl: Oh my gosh. Lesley Stahl: So in the middle of the afternoon, they are learning a dance for that night for the first time? Jesse Cole: I mean, players, the talent level, they learn a tremendous amount of steps for about 20 minutes, 30 minutes' rehearsal, and then they're doing it in front of a sold out crowd. And sometimes practicing in front of the crowd. Jackson Olson: I remember looking at you and you were doing the dance too, you were trying to learn it. Like, we were all trying to learn this stuff during the game. D.R. Meadows: Keep it fresh. Banana ball players have full-year contracts and are paid significantly more than most minor leaguers. Their salaries have risen every year, as has their fan base. This was the home stadium of the Philadelphia Phillies on a Saturday night in September -- a completely sold out, standing room only crowd of 45,000. It was one of six Major League Baseball stadiums the Bananas sold out last season, including Fenway Park. With clips of dances like this going viral, the Bananas now have more TikTok followers than all 12 of last year's MLB playoff teams combined. As in Savannah, crowds gather hours early. Banana Ball is now a multi-million dollar private business — Jesse turns away investors. To build fans, he reinvests; he keeps ticket prices low — $60 max — and broadcasts all games free on YouTube. playing in an mlb stadium, players told us, is thrilling.. even for someonealready10 feet tall. Dakota Albritton: Just this section right here is big as my whole entire hometown. \"Stilts\" told us he'd bepitchingthis game. Lesley Stahl: Do you really throw strikes? Dakota Albritton: Oh, absolutely. It comin' straight down like that, they gotta hit it just perfect or they're gonna ground out or pop up. And sure enough, in the top of the 6th, facing the Party Animals version of a switch hitter, there was one of those strikes. With the pressure on, he got the third out. Then, in the bottom of the 7th, with a runner on first and the Bananas down by one, Jackson Olson took off on a ball 4 sprint. Then with men on the corners, the former Nationals signee, RAC, was up. A 3-run homer. As far as we could see, nobody left early. This season, Banana Ball has officially become a league, with two more teams. And they'll play not just at 17 MLB stadiums, but at three NFL football stadiums as well. Lesley Stahl: Will you fill those stadiums? Jesse Cole: They're sold out. Lesley Stahl: Already? Jesse Cole: It's crazy. Lesley Stahl: All of it's crazy. Some might even say, bananas. Produced by Shari Finkelstein and Collette Richards. Broadcast associate, Aria Een. Edited by April Wilson.

    "title": "Trump's focus on Greenland ignites sense of defiance on isolated Arctic island",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 13, 2025 / 7:44 PM EDT/ CBS News President Trump's focus on taking control of Greenland, a self-governing territory of the Kingdom of Denmark, has upset many in the Arctic. Mr. Trump's Greenland fixation is offensive to Aqqaluk Lynge, an elder Inuit statesman who once represented the Arctic population at the United Nations. Around 57,000 people live in Greenland, a population that's largely Inuit, an indigenous Arctic people of Alaska, Canada, and Greenland. Greenlanders have united behind a mantra: we are not for sale, but we are open for business. And Lynge offered up a defiant message of his own. \"If you should try something in the Arctic, you should be very careful,\" Lynge said. \"I think we should say, ice is slippery.\" Greenland, first settled by Viking adventurer Erik the Red around 982, has been part of the Danish Kingdom for around 300 years, though its capital — Nuuk — sits closer to New York than it does to Copenhagen. The U.S. first discussed acquiring the territory, situated between North America and Europe,in the 1860s. During the second World War, after Denmark was invaded by the Nazis,the U.S. was given control of Greenland.During that time, the U.S. built 17 military bases on the island. The most significant, Bluie West One in Narsarsuaq — located in the south of the territory, was a crucial stopoff before D-Day. The base was shut down in the 50s, but a military museum celebrating America's presence remains. After the war ended, President Harry Truman tried to buy Greenland for $100 million, seeing its location and resources, including its rich mineral deposits, asbeneficial to defense of the Americas. Denmark declined, but the two countries did sign a treaty in1951, which was amended in2004and still stands today — and gives broad license for the U.S. military to operate on the island. Mr. Trump first eyed Greenland in2019. The Prime Minister of Denmark called the overtures \"absurd.\" Since Mr. Trump has been re-elected, he's been persistent in his desire to acquire territory and hasdeclined to take military force off the tableas a means to do so. The administration maintains that it is essential for world security that Greenland becomes part of the U.S.  Today, the Pituffik Space Base, which Vice President JD Vance visitedlast month, figures critically in U.S. anti-missile defense. As ice caps melt and the Arctic trade routes and new sea lanes become more important, U.S. control, the administration believes, would thwartRussiaandChina's presencein the western hemisphere. Mr. Trump has derided Denmark for not being up to the job of staving off potential threats. \"The routes are, you know, very direct to Asia, to Russia, and you have ships all over the place. And we have to have protection. So, we're going to have to make a deal on that. And Denmark is not able to do that. You know, Denmark is very far away and really has nothing to do,\"Mr. Trump said last monthin the Oval Office. But political scientist and University of Copenhagen professor Ole Wæver questions the premise of Trump's aggressive stance. He's unsure why the Trump administration is trying to acquire Greenland when America has always been so welcomed there. \"Bottom line is, the Americans are militarily on Greenland as much as they want,\" Wæver said. If Mr. Trump said he wanted to put up another base in Greenland, without buying, annexing or seizing the land, he wouldn't get a no, Wæver said. A growing number of people fear severe repercussions if the U.S. acquires Greenland by force. It could rewrite the world of international relations if the U.S. annexes Greenland, Wæver said. \"It is just a violation that is just one bridge further than anything we have seen so far,\" Wæver said. Apart from geo-strategy, the U.S. has offered another reason for acquiring Greenland: the untapped minerals. Trump's inner circle portrays Greenland as packed with commodities and natural resources essential for the future world economy, such as gold, zinc and copper. But getting access to them, like getting to anything else in Greenland, is a mission in itself. Eldur Ólafsson, CEO of Amaroq Minerals, invited 60 Minutes to visit Nalunaq gold mine—one of the two active mines in Greenland. Mines across the territory have come and gone over the centuries, largely because of the logistical challenges. With gold prices at all-time highs, Ólafsson estimates that with prudent planning and patience, there is $150 million a year to be made from Nalunaq. There may be gold in Greenland, but geologists 60 Minutes consulted with, in both the U.S. and Greenland, said that the promise of a Greenland natural resource jackpotis not the case. Plenty of countries — America included — have just as many, if not more, untapped minerals. Mr. Trump's focus on acquiring Greenland has left its citizens scratching their heads, Wæver said. When Mr. Trump first expressed interest in Greenland, which has a history of welcoming the U.S., it fueled a spirit of independence. It also prompted locals to reassess their relationship with Denmark, which pumps around $800 million a year into Greenland's economy, but also, historically, imposed its values on Inuit culture. In the country's capital Nuuk, population 20,000, thousands turned out last month to demonstrate against U.S. plans to acquire Greenland. \"It's all clear that we stand together. No matter what political color you have,\"  Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen told 60 Minutes at the rally. \"Greenland is for Greenlanders, not for anybody else.\" Maliina Abelsen, a former finance minister and native Greenlander, described the relationship between Denmark and Greenland as a forced marriage, at least on Greenland's side. Mr. Trump expressing interest, she said, is like \"a lover coming into the relationship.\" \"I think that some people got a little attracted and they thought, 'Ooh, that could be much better. That lover looks so rich and powerful,'\" she said, but added: \"We have also seen how our Inuit cousins live in Alaska, and how they were treated.\" It's not a road Greenland wants to go down, she said. Per one recent poll, just 6% of the local population favors U.S. control. The spotlight thrown onto her homeland has been overwhelming, Abelsen said. \"It's intense because the whole world order is changing,\" she said. L.

    "title": "Trump's fight for Greenland pushes Earth's largest island into the spotlight",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 13, 2025 / 7:44 PM EDT/ CBS News With a landmass three times that of Texas, but with a population—just 57,000—able to fit comfortably inside an NFL stadium, Greenland has long been a forgotten outpost. No more. The world's largest island is suddenly the belle of the geopolitical ball, with outsized consequences. President Trump offered to buy the territory from the Danish government that controls it. When his overtures were dismissed as absurd, Trump doubled-down and nowdeclines to rule out force, also vowing to acquire Greenland quote \"one way or the other.\" It makes for strange and scary times for the predominantly indigenous Inuit population. We bundled up and then trundled up to tour a bitingly cold place, in what is suddenly a hot neighborhood. Who knows for how much longer, but for now Greenlandtrulymight be the last frontier, all snow-dusted mountains and icebergs — blazing blue and sometimes the size of cruise ships — that come lazing down the fjords. Greenland has been part of the Danish kingdom for 300 years, though the capital Nuuk sits closer to New York than it does to Copenhagen. And the towns and villages cling only to the coastline; with no roads connecting them. You're better off cross-country skiing the terrain, as does Maliina Abelsen, a former finance minister and a native Greenlinder. The spotlight cast on her homeland is, she says, overwhelming. Maliina Abelsen: This is new for us, and we probably have to get used to-- to the attention. It's so much more intense at the moment. Jon Wertheim: And it's intense because why specifically? Maliina Abelsen: It's intense because the whole world order is changing. She's currently chairperson of the largest company in the territory, Royal Greenland, a leader in fishing, an industry that accounts for more than 90% of the territory's exports. Doing business here, on top of the world, gives a whole new meaning to the phrase weather dependent. Maliina Abelsen: So when people come to Greenland they can get very frustrated when they say, \"Oh, my flight was delayed with five hours.\" And I say, \"Five hours? That's not a delay; five weeks is a delay.\" So you kind of have to adapt. Because otherwise you are not able to survive here in Greenland. The territory is lodged between North America and Europe, so massive it encompasses three time zones; yet so sparse that in one of those time zones the listed population is eight. But determined to explore, we headed south from Nuuk by plane. We were prepared for delays, less so the annihilating cold on a boat ride across a fjord. The temperature that balmy morning? Minus-12 Fahrenheit. Our destination: the Plymouth Rock of Greenland. Greenland was settled by Erik the Red, so named as much for his fiery temper as his fiery beard. Banished from his native Norway, he headed west and ended up right around here,in 982. He was a fearless and fearsome frontiersman. Erik the Red wasalso a slick marketer and salesman. This vast patch of ice? He named it Greenland in hopes of luring investors, farmers and other settlers. A thousand years later… Donald Trump (3/4/25): \"We will make you rich, and together, we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before..\" A different kind of sales pitch, this to a joint session of Congress last month. Donald Trump (3/4/25): \"And I also have a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland… We strongly support your right to determine your own future.\" Aqqaluk Lynge: We saw your faces at Congress grinning about Greenland. Aqqaluk Lynge, an elder Inuit statesman once represented the Arctic population at the United Nations. For him, Trump's Greenland fixation is more than troubling; it's offensive. Aqqaluk Lynge: When he mentioned-- Greenland, like it was a toy or-- or something. Jon Wertheim: You noticed that? Aqqaluk Lynge: We all noticed that in Greenland, all of us. And it was ugly. When President Trump first made eyes at Greenland in2019, on the island, it had the effect of fueling a spirit of independence, a reassessment of the relationship with Denmark, which pumps in around $800 million a year, but also, historically, imposed its values on Inuit culture. The coupling of Denmark and Greenland, well, it's complicated. Maliina Abelsen: It's like a forced marriage, if you can say so. At least it was from the Greenlandic side. 'Cause they-- we have never been asked if we wanna be part of the Danish kingdom. Then we have a lover coming into the relationship. And that lover is pointing at one and saying, \"Oh, I really, really like your wife there. And that's when you saw that there was whole dynamic change between Denmark and Greenland. Jon Wertheim: Should we keep going with that analogy? Are you attracted to the lover? Maliina Abelsen: I think that some people got a little attracted and they thought, \"Ooh, that could be much better. That-- lover looks so rich and powerful.\" But we have also seen how our Inuit-- cousins live in-- in-- in Alaska, and how they were treated. We definitely do not wanna go down that road. In the city, such as it is, of Nuuk, (population 20,000) locals turned out last month for a demonstration: a remarkable show of unity for a country so spread out, and, historically, so measured. The rally included newly elected Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen. Jens-Frederik Nielsen: And it's all clear that we stand together, no matter what-- political color you have, we stand together on this issue. Greenland is for Greenlanders, not for anybody else. The demonstration ended outside an old wooden cottage that serves as the American consulate. Per one recent poll, just 6% of the local population favor U.S. control. The loudest pro-American voice we encountered was an American; the founder of the \"Bikers for Trump.\" Chris Cox: My name is Chris Cox. I'm from the United States and I have come here to try to make some friends. On his own dime and own time, Cox came to Greenland from his home in Charleston, South Carolina, a Trump evangelist on an unofficial mission. Chris Cox: We are not looking at you like a tiger looks at a gazelle wanting to pounce on you. Jon Wertheim: What have you learned about this place? Chris Cox: I've learned that it-- it's-- it's a very unique people. They're a docile people. They're a peaceful people. The U.S. has long been enthralled by Greenland. In the 1860s—the gilded age of empire, when land masses were bought and sold like horses-and-buggies—talk first surfaced of America acquiring the territory. During the second World War, Americans weregiven controlof Greenland. They built 17 military bases. The most significant, Bluie West One in Narsarsuaq, in the south of the territory, was a crucial stopoff before D-Day. When the Americans shut the base down in the 50s, they didn't much clean up after themselves; these drums remain today, but so does a military museum celebrating America's presence here. On display: images of proud American airmen, some of whom left a literal legacy. Maliina Abelsen: There's a strong-- long relationship with the Americans. And as-- I am one of them-- or what can you say, my grandmother had a child with the American soldier from Narsarsuaq -- I-- I am a product of that relationship. Jon Wertheim: You're one quarter American, essentially. Maliina Abelsen: That's correct. After the War,President Trumantried to buy Greenland for $100 million in gold. Denmark declined, but the two countries did sign a1951treaty—it still stands today—giving broad license for the U.S. military to operate in Greenland. Today, Tule, now called Pituffik Space Base, figures critically in U.S. anti-missile defense, and was the site of Vice President Vance'srecent visit— a visit that triggered thefiring of the base commanderfor - in the eyes of the Trump administration - not showing sufficient support for the U.S. agenda there. The administration maintains that acquiring Greenland is essential for world security. As ice caps melt and the Arctic trade routes and new sea lanes become more important, U.S. control would thwart Russia and China's access. Trump has derided Denmark for not being up to the job. But why would the current administration seek to acquire a place where America has always been so welcomed? In Copenhagen, political scientist Ole Wæver, questions the entire premise of Trump's aggressive stance. Ole Wæver: Bottom line is the Americans are militarily on Greenland as much as they want. Jon Wertheim: So if President Trump said, \"We wanna do X in Greenland,\" outside of this realm of-- of buying, or annexing, or seizing. Just-- \"We need to put up a base in Greenland--\" Ole Wæver: They wouldn't get a no. Jon Wertheim: They wouldn't get a no? Ole Wæver: No. Jon Wertheim: So, what's going on here? Ole Wæver: That's a good question. And everyone is-- is scratching their heads in-- in-- in Copenhagen and-- and Nuuk as well. For all the head scratching, the consequences could be severe. Ole Wæver: To invade and-- and annex a part of another member country then it would be necessary in the next NATO meeting to say by everyone else that this is a violation of everything we know. Jon Wertheim: This would blow NATO to pieces? Ole Wæver: It would. It is just a violation that is just one bridge further than anything we have seen so far. Wæver also joins the chorus of those worrying that if the U.S. annexes Greenland, it would rewrite the rules for international relations…Ukraine invaded by Russia. Or China potentially taking over Taiwan?….Incursions like these play differently if we're now in a might-makes-right world. Apart from geo-strategy, the U.S. does offer another reason for acquiring Greenland. It's that time-honored justification for empire building: riches, lots of riches. Thereareminerals in Greenland. But getting to them, like getting anything and anywhere here, is a mission in itself. We joined Eldur Ólafsson, CEO of Amaroq Minerals, which operates one of the two active mines in Greenland. Jon Wertheim: I think there are mines in this world that are easier to get to. Eldur Ólafsson: Certainly, yes. The Trump inner circle portrays Greenland as a bonanza, a cookie jar of commodities and natural resources: gold, zinc, copper and rare earth minerals, seen as essential for the future world economy. Mines across Greenland have come and gone over the centuries, largely because of the logistical challenges. But with gold prices at all-time highs, Ólafsson estimates that, with prudent planning and patience, there is $150 million a year to be made from this mine. Jon Wertheim: So we're going into the mountain now? Eldur Ólafsson: Yeah. So we're going into and up, which is quite rare in today's mining world. ….Not for the claustrophobic, it's a bumpy 30-minute ride through sinuous tunnels… Jon Wertheim: You just haphazardly picked up this shard, but I c-- I can see with the naked eye, you can see all the gold there. Eldur Ólafsson: Yes. Jon Wertheim: How much gold is in this gold belt? Eldur Ólafsson: We can't say for certain, because we would have to drill it all out. This is completely untested. So-- dozens of millions of ounces potential, for sure. Jon Wertheim: Millions of ounces of gold-- Eldur Ólafsson: Mmm. Jon Wertheim: --here in Greenland, potentially? Eldur Ólafsson: Yeah. There may be gold in them, thar hills… but geologists we consulted were deeply skeptical of the promise of any natural resource jackpotin Greenland.Plenty of other countries — America included — have just as many, if not a lot more untapped minerals. Regardless of who, ultimately, controls Greenland, foreign investment into sectors like mining is — and always has been — welcome…consistent with a catchphrase we heard repeatedly: we are not for sale; but we are open for business. Still, this vast land has been thrown, vastly, off-balance. Jon Wertheim: Is there any sense that this is just about the ambition to expand and plant a flag and this isn't about bases and resources? Maliina Abelsen: Yeah but-- that's what-- that's what concerns me. We're talking about people who lives here. It's disrespectful. Aqqaluk Lynge has a more defiant message still: Aqqaluk Lynge: If you should try something in the Arctic-- you should be very careful. I think-- we should say-- ice is slippery.

    "title": "Zelenskyy says if Russia not stopped in Ukraine, war could escalate",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 13, 2025 / 7:43 PM EDT/ CBS News PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyysays he fears Russia'sthree-year waron Ukraine could escalate if Ukraine, supported by its allies, does not stand firm against further Russian military advancement. Zelenskyy sat down with 60 Minutes in his hometown of Kryvyi Rih, a week after aRussian missile killed 19 people, including nine children near a playground. Zelenskyy said that at this moment in the war, the security of the entire world is at stake. \"If we do not stand firm, he (Russian President Vladimir Putin) will advance further,\" Zelenskyy said. \"It is not just idle speculation; the threat is real. Putin's ultimate goal is to revive the Russian empire and reclaim territories currently under NATO protection. Considering all of this, I believe it could escalate into a world war.\" He added: \"There won't be a safe place, there won't be a safe place for (anyone).\" At the destroyed playground, Zelenskyy laid his memorial to the nine dead children. He told correspondent Scott Pelley about this latest attack: \"This means that we can't trust Russia. It's that we can't trust negotiations with Russia.\" There are daily Russian strikes on Ukrainian cities.1,700 attacks on schools, over 600 children dead, 780 medical facilities attacked, 13,000 civilians killed, and as many as 100,000 Ukrainian soldiers dead. \"Our people are paying the highest price possible,\" Zelenskyy told 60 Minutes. \"There is no higher price. We have given all our money – all we have in terms of finances. But most important, we gave [the lives of] our people.\" These are the points Zelenskyy tried to convey in February, as President Trump opened negotiations with Russia - initially without Ukraine. Then, Mr. Trump also claimed that Ukraine had started the war and called the democratically-elected Zelenskyy, \"a dictator without elections. Zelenskyy better move fast or he's not going to have a country left. Gotta move, gotta move fast 'cause that war is moving in the wrong direction.\" Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. \"I believe, sadly, (that) Russian narratives are prevailing in the U.S.,\" Zelenskyy said. \"How is it possible to witness our losses and our suffering, to understand what the Russians are doing, and to still believe that they are not the aggressors, that they did not start this war? This speaks to the enormous influence of Russia's information policy on America, on U.S. politics and U.S. politicians.\" In February, Zelenskyy traveled to Washington for theOval Office meeting with Mr. Trump. He listened to the U.S. president equate Ukraine's dead to those of Russia's invasion force. \"President Trump, being a strong president of a strong country, must be on Ukraine's side,\" Zelenskyy said. \"I think it is wrong that America wants to be neutral.\" The Trump Administration says it is working tonegotiate a deal to end the war. On Friday, Mr. Trump's special envoySteve Witkoff met with Putin in Moscow, for what the White House called \"another step in the negotiating process towards a ceasefire and an ultimate peace deal in Russia and Ukraine.\" Mr. Trump vowed during the election campaign last year to bring a swift end to the war. The White House has announced partial ceasefires, but they haven't happened. Now, Trump says that he is losing patience with Putin. Zelenskyy said he would welcome Mr. Trump in Ukraine so he could \"understand what's going on here.\" \"We respect your position,\" he said in English, in an invitation directed to Mr. Trump, \"but, please, before any kind of decisions, any kind of plans for negotiations, come to see the people, civilians, warriors, hospitals, churches, children destroyed or dead.\" \"Come, look, and then let's move with a plan on how to finish the war. You will understand with whom you have a deal. You will understand what Putin did.\" Produced by Maria Gavrilovic. Associate Producer Alex Ortiz. Edited by Peter Berman.

    "article_text": "After a topsy-turvy final round, Rory McIlroy held on to win the 89th Masters Tournament in a one-hole playoff Sunday, earning his fifth major championship and his first since 2014. The victory ends an 11-year major championship drought for the second-ranked golfer in the world. McIlroy had not won one of the sport’s premier tournaments since 2014, when he took the U.S. Open. Previously, McIlroy’s best finish at the Masters was second in 2022. In addition to a green jacket, McIlroy will take home $4.2 million as the Masters winner. Entering the day with a two-shot lead over Bryson DeChambeau for first place, McIlroy somehow found himself neck and neck with Justin Rose after 15 holes. Needing only par on the 18th hole to win, McIlroy bogeyed to set up the playoff against Rose. Playing the same hole again to determine a winner, McIlroy recorded a birdie while Rose shot for par. It was nearly a massive come-from-behind victory for Rose, who shot a final-round 66, nine strokes better than he shot on Day 3. He finished his day tied with McIlroy for the lead at 11 under par despite having started seven strokes behind. McIlroy, who was 12 under par after three rounds, was only 10 under after 14 holes. But he birdied both 15 and 17 to take back the lead. On the 18th, he still had a chance for par after a shot into the bunker, but he missed a relatively short putt. The day got off to an inauspicious start for McIlroy, who hit a double bogey on his first hole. After he hit three birdies between holes 3 and 10, his lead began to slip away, as holes 11-14 went bogey, par, double bogey and bogey. The lull set the stage for the dramatic finish, but McIlroy was ultimately able to avoid a collapse similar to the one at the 2011 Masters, when he started the final round with a four-shot lead but shot an 80 on Day 4. Golf’s next major will be the PGA Championship, which begins May 15 at the Quail Hollow Club in Charlotte, North Carolina.",

    "title": "The hottest new social scene might be a book club",
    "article_text": "They pick a title, read it and then gather to discuss it in detail. But unlike more traditional book clubs, many of these groups add on another activity — or multiple — to turn their gatherings into social events rather than introverted hangs. Some of the groups like to run after reading. Others enjoy making charm bracelets. One group hosts an annual “Booksgiving,” where members bring their own titles to wrap for a blind book exchange. Across the U.S., book clubs have transformed into social scenes, with many readers saying these groups have been a lifeline to building friendships and seeking community in a post-pandemic world. “It’s definitely evolved from the traditional, ‘Oh, let’s meet at a coffee shop, talk about the book, go over these discussion questions,’” said Ijanae Dawkins, 26,founder of Philly’s chapter of a club called Book and Sip. “I have people every month come up to me at the book parties, and they’re like, ‘Oh my gosh, I was so shy coming into it. This is my first book party. I made three new friends and we’re going out next weekend.’” Book club events proliferated by 31% on Eventbrite in 2024 compared to 2023, according to recent data from the event platform. In particular, listings for silent book clubs — a type of book event where attendees get to mingle after independently reading in silence — more than doubled while book clubs for romance-fantasy (a staple genre of #BookTok) quadrupled. Some readers credit the explosive growth of unique book clubs to the Covid-19 pandemic, during which many former book lovers had the time to rediscover their passion for reading. That, combined with a yearning for meaningful relationships and in-person activities, created the opportunity for socially centered book clubs to flourish in recent years. “Reading is such an escape,” said Allison Yates, 33, who founded Chicago’s inaugural Read and Run club. “But really what people want is to feel something deeply, and it slows us down a lot in a time when everything is digital and everything is fast-paced.” The trendiest book clubs today incorporate activities outside of discussing the book itself — such as wine tastings, blind book exchanges and local walks or running tours. About 79% of Gen Zers and millennialssurveyed by Eventbritesaid they are seeking events that blend multiple interests. Yates’ group meetups, for example, feature a guided run through a string of locations mentioned in that week’s book pick. At arecent gathering, after reading former first lady Michelle Obama’s memoir, “Becoming,” members took a 4-mile run through Chicago’s Hyde Park (where the Obamas resided for years) before ending the event with a book discussion, complete with snacks from a local popcorn chain she frequented as a teenager. Chicago is among the cities that have seen the most dramatic growth in book-oriented events from 2023 to 2024, according to Eventbrite. Others include San Francisco, Chicago, Los Angeles and Boston.",

    "article_text": "One personis in custody in relation to the fireset at Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’s official residence in Harrisburg early Sunday, officials said. Cody Balmer will be charged with attempted murder, terrorism, aggravated arson and aggravated assault against an enumerated person, Dauphin County District Attorney Fran Chardo said at a news conference. In astatement on social media, Shapiro wrote that his family woke up at 2 a.m. to banging on the door from state police. He added that he and his wife, Lori, were “eternally grateful” for authorities who helped evacuate the family. “Thank God no one was injured and the fire was extinguished,” Shapiro wrote. “Every day, we stand with the law enforcement and first responders who run towards danger to protect our communities.” President Donald Trump exemptedsmartphones, computers and other tech devicesand components from his new tariffs, new guidance from U.S. Customs and Border Protection shows. The administration imposed 145% tariffs on products from China this month, a move that threatened to take a toll on tech giants like Apple, which makes most of its products in China. The White House said Saturday the exemptions were issued because Trump wants to ensure that companies have time to move production to the United States. The evolving policy has caused uncertainty in Washington and on Wall Street. Here’s what else to know: Top White House trade adviserPeter Navarro denied that there are tensions between him and Elon Musk, days after Musk called Navarro a “moron.” “Everything’s fine with Elon,” Navarro said NBC News’ “Meet the Press,” “I’ve been called worse.” A CNBC interview last week prompted Musk to criticize Navarro in a series of posts on X, in which he called Navarro “dumber than a sack of bricks.” He followed that with a sarcastic apology, saying the comparison was “so unfair to bricks.” Navarro laughed off reports of tensions between the two men, going on to praise Musk’s efforts with the Department of Government Efficiency, saying he has made a “tremendous contribution to America.” A pause in federal NIH funding has researchers scrambling for contingency plansat the University of Washington’s Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centerin Seattle, which is preserving more than 4,000 brains in the hope of better understanding the condition. The program is in limbo because the Trump administration has upended the system that funds biomedical research, with thousands of grants caught in what critics say is an unprecedented slowdown of the American research system that is threatening to upend universities and halt progress toward medical innovations, treatments and cures. So what will happen to patient care and the brains banked for research? “We’ve gone through a bunch of contingency planning,” said Dr. Thomas Grabowski, the center’s director. “When it starts to look like multiple, multiple, multiple months, then there’s not a good answer to your question.” A thick stench hangs over Birmingham, Britain’s second-largest city, as asix-week standoff between striking garbage truck workersand the City Council over pay has led to mountains of uncollected trash lining the streets. Worse than the pungent smell, said shop owner Ghulam Murtaza Qureshi, are the “rats and mice,” whose population has grown exponentially as the piles of waste outside his store have gotten bigger and bigger. Resident Charlie Wilson said as she sat on her front porch: “You’re not getting little rats anymore. They’re getting cat-size.” So bad is the situation that local lawmakers declared a “major incident” this month in the city, where some residents say their quality of life is worse than in developing countries and held it up as an example of “Broken Britain” — which is how some describe the perceived breakdown of public services in the country.",

    "article_text": "Around 10 million people remain under fire alerts in an area stretching from South Dakota down to Texas and Arizona on Sunday afternoon. Wind gusts as high as 30-40 mph, combined with warm temperatures, dry vegetation and relative humidity values as low as 5%, are expected to create hazardous conditions for the development of new fires. San Antonio, Texas; Colorado Springs, Colorado; Santa Fe, New Mexico; and Tucson, Arizona, are among the areas at risk. Sunday afternoon will be relatively breezy across the Plains due to a cold front, with 12 million under wind alerts through the evening. Dallas and Waco, Texas, and Springfield, Missouri, are included in these alerts, as some gusts may exceed 40-50 mph. Still, temperatures across the Plains as well as the West and Southwest will remain 10 to 25 degrees above average Sundayafternoon. Highs will reach the 80s and 100s, with a few temperature records possibly being broken in Dallas, Amarillo and Lubbock, Texas, and Tucson, Arizona. As a cold front sweeps through the Plains, temperatures will drop closer to average at the start of the workweek across the heart of the country. Afternoon temperatures will still stay 10 to 20 degrees above average across the West, Southwest and Southeast. Potential records could be reported Sunday in San Antonio and Houston, Texas, and Asheville, North Carolina. The cold front will bring a chance of scattered showers to the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes on Sunday afternoon through the evening. A transition to snow is anticipated for parts of northern Minnesota and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. On Monday, 1 to 3 inches of snow, with local amounts exceeding 6 inches, will be possible. No severe weather or flooding is expected Sunday, but as the front progresses east Monday, there is a slight risk of severe weather across the Ohio Valley. Around 9 million people are under risk of damaging wind, quarter-sized hail and a tornado or two. The risk area includes Columbus and Cincinnati, Ohio; Pittsburgh; and Lexington, Kentucky, where storms may develop late afternoon Monday into the evening. Spring showers are also affecting parts of the Northern Tier Sunday afternoon, with snow over Montana and rain stretching from the Dakotas to Wisconsin.",

    "title": "Frontier CEO is 'optimistic' about tourism industry despite economic uncertainty",
    "article_text": "Despite a downturn in foreign tourism and broader economic uncertainty, Frontier CEO Barry Biffle remains optimistic about the budget airline’s future. “People think that there’s some kind of Armageddon going to happen,” Biffle said in an exclusive interview with “NBC Nightly News” correspondent Hallie Jackson that airs Sunday. “I think that as we look here today, I’m optimistic.” Travel experts have been sounding the alarm amid President Donald Trump’s global trade war, warning that a year that was initially projected to be profitable for the tourism industry could instead face an economic downturn. Before Trumpannounced a 90-day pauseon most of his proposed tariffs, Delta CEO Ed Bastiantold CNBClastweekthat air travel has all but stalled for both leisure and business travel. “I think everyone’s prepared for uncertainty,” Bastian said. “If that continues and we don’t get resolution soon, we probably will end up in a recession.” Biffle acknowledged the bleak outlook shared by those in the airline industry. “What’s become clear is, obviously, there’s been some challenges with travel demand, and we’ve seen it in all industries now. Hotels, airlines, cruise lines are seeing less bookings,” he said. However, Biffle believes Frontier's ultra-low-cost model positions it to thrive, especially as consumers become more price-conscious. He likens Frontier's appeal to that of retailers like Walmart, suggesting that when the economy is down, value-oriented businesses tend to perform better. “What’s happened is there’s going to be a massive reversal of fortune,” he said. “Over the last several years, the legacy carriers have done very, very well at the expense of us, but there’s now too much domestic supply.” “In any type of recessionary or kind of economic challenge environment — the ‘Walmart effect,’ you know — businesses like ours do well,” he added. Amid economic uncertainty and stricterimmigration policies, overseas travelers are increasingly canceling trips to the United States. According to the National Travel and Tourism Office, international travel to the United States was down 12% in March compared with a year ago. “Right now, we’re seeing boycott travel to the United States out of Europe,” Biffle said. “So can you imagine maybe not 70% — if it’s just down 20%, that’s a massive market. This is a huge challenge.” Biffle predicted that the hottest travel spots for Americans this summer will be domestic locations. “Domestic is in vogue again because of a lot of things going on in the marketplace,” he said. “And so I think you’re going to see a lot of people travel all over the United States this summer.” To adapt to current market conditions, Frontier is implementing strategic changes. It has revamped its pricing strategy by introducingbundled fare options, including offerings with extra legroom andempty middle seats. Frontier also plans to attract more domestic travelers by offeringfirst-class seatslater this year. In addition, Biffle touted theairline's plans to eliminate bag feesthis summer. The bag fee move appeared to be aimed at Frontier competitor Southwest Airlines, whichannounced last monththat it would begin charging for checked bags. The decision sparked outrage among consumers. Biffle also raised worries about ashortage of U.S. air traffic controllers, a concern shared by aviation safety experts, particularly after thefatal midair collisionbetween an American Airlines passenger jet and an Army helicopter in January. “On a normal day with no weather, it’s generally not that big of a challenge,” Biffle said. “However, I’ll take Florida as an example — Christmas, New Year’s, Presidents Day, spring break, weekends, if you mix any kind of weather with that, we have cancellations across the industry, and the reason for it is we exceed the capabilities of all of the air traffic controllers there.” But Biffle said he is confident the Trump administration is working to reduce the shortage, and he maintained that air travel is “the safest way to travel, and I think that we’re getting safer.”",

According to the FBI, officials found what they called a “manifesto” while searching for a device that belonged to Casap. The document called for the president’s assassination in order to instigate a race war and sow chaos. Casap also disclosed his plans to others on TikTok and Telegram, and identified himself as a follower of Order of the Nine Angles, which the FBI describes as a neo-Nazi cult that “advocates for the use of violence and terrorism to overthrow governments and destroy modern civilization.” According to the FBI, Casap allegedly partially paid for “a drone with a dropping mechanism” to inflict harm by descending “an explosive, Molotov cocktail, or very strong topical poison” on a target. “The killing of his parents appeared to be an effort to obtain the financial means and autonomy necessary to carrying out his plan,” the affidavit read. Casap was arrested on Feb. 28 after running a stop sign while driving his stepfather’s Volkswagen Atlas in WaKeeney, Kansas, 800 miles away from his Wisconsin home. The car contained his stepfather’s Smith & Wesson .357 Magnum, the victims’ driver’s licenses and spent shell casings, according to a complaint. The 17-year-old was originally charged with operating a motor vehicle without the owner’s consent and theft of movable property, before eventually being hit with two counts of first-degree homicide, two counts of hiding a corpse, theft of property over $10,000 and two counts of misappropriating ID to obtain money, according to Waukesha officials. According to the FBI, Casap had shared his plans to kill his parents with a classmate. The teen appeared in court on March 27, where it was revealed that  his mother had been found in a hallway covered with blankets and a towel, while his stepfather was found in a first-floor office covered in a pile of clothing. Casap’s attorneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "title": "'A Minecraft Movie' stomps to $80.6 million in second weekend",
    "article_text": "After just two weeks in theaters,“A Minecraft Movie”is already the highest grossing Hollywood release of 2025. The Warner Bros. video game adaptation followed up its blockbuster opening with a second weekend of $80.6 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. Worldwide, it’s quickly surpassed $550 million. After doubling expectations in its $300 million global debut, “A Minecraft Movie” continued to draw audiences unlike anything else this year. The film, directed by Jared Hess and starring Jack Black and Jason Momoa, slid 50% in its second go-around in U.S. and Canadian theaters — an impressive hold after such a big debut. Though critics slammed the movie (46% “fresh” on Rotten Tomatoes) and audience scores were merely good (a “B+” CinemaScore), “A Minecraft Movie” latched on with moviegoers who have increasingly turned out in droves for big-budget videogame adaptations. “A Minecraft Movie,” a $150 million co-production of Warner Bros. and Legendary Entertainment, has helped -– at least for now -– reinvigorate theaters after a dismal start to the year. Overall ticket sales were double that of the same weekend in 2024, according to Comscore. Before “A Minecraft,” box office revenues trailed last year’s by 11%, but have now virtually pulled even. (2025 grosses still trail 2019’s by 31%, according to Comscore.) None of the weekend’s new releases — Angel Studios’ “The King of Kings,” the Walt Disney Co.’s “The Amateur,” Universal Pictures’ “Drop” or A24’s “Warfare” — came close to challenging “Minecraft,” but several films outperformed expectations. “The King of Kings,” an animated tale of Jesus’ life aimed at Christian audiences, came in second with $19.1 million in 3,200 theaters. The film, loosely based on a children’s book by Charles Dickens, includes a starry voice cast led by Oscar Isaac, Kenneth Branagh and Uma Thurman. With an enviable “A+” CinemaScore from audiences, “The King of Kings” is posed to capitalize in the coming week before Easter. Part three of Fathom Entertainment’s TV series, “The Chosen: Last Supper,” also looked to appeal to Christian audiences. It launched with $6.2 million from 2,296 cinemas. “The Amateur,” a 20th Century production starring Rami Malek as a CIA cryptographer hunting down his wife’s killers, debuted with $15 million domestically, plus another $17.2 million overseas. Critics deemed the revenge thriller an awkward star vehicle for Malek, who also produced. “The Amateur” cost $60 million to make. “Warfare,” director Alex Garland’s follow-up to 2024’s “Civil War,” opened with $8.3 million in ticket sales from 2,670 theaters. Garland co-wrote and co-directed the A24 release with Iraq War veteran Ray Mendoza, who based the film on 2006 mission he and his fellow Navy SEALs undertook during the war. “Warfare,” which cost about $20 million to make, was lauded by critics as an uncommonly realistic portrait of combat. “Drop,” the latest thriller from Blumhouse Productions, debuted with $7.5 million from 3,085 theaters. Christopher Landon’s film stars Meghann Fahy (“The White Lotus”) as a single-mom widow on a first date (Brandon Sklenar) who’s being terrorized by an unknown person by messages to her phone. “Drop,” which premiered at SXSW, cost less than $10 million to produce",

    "title": "Helicopter in Hudson River crash lacked flight recorders, officials say",
    "article_text": "As crewscontinue to search for key parts of the helicopter that crashed into the Hudson River, they won’t find one piece of evidence that is usually critical to investigators. “The helicopter was not equipped with any flight recorders. No onboard video recorders or camera recorders have been recovered and none of the helicopter avionics onboard recorded information that could be used for the investigation,” the National Transportation Safety Board said in astatement Saturday. Thursday’sdeadly accidentclaimed the lives of a family of five visiting from Spain and the pilot. “Divers from the New York Police Department are continuing to search for the helicopter’s main rotor, main gear box, tail rotor and a large portion of the tail boom. Side-scanning sonar is being used to identify potential locations of wreckage,” the NTSB’s statement said. According to officials, the last major inspection of the helicopter was on March 1, and before the crash it completed seven tour flights. Now, lawmakers are calling on federal agencies to increase regulations and protocols for these types of helicopter tours. “The company has an operating certificate from the [Federal Aviation Administration] that is called a ‘Part 91.’ It does not require the entire team of people who oversee or fly the helicopter to have the level of training and experience that commercial and passenger helicopter companies have to have,” Sen. Chuck Schumer said Sunday at a press conference. He spoke at the Wall Street Heliport in Manhattan, where New York Helicopter Tours launched the fatal Bell 206 L-4 flight on Thursday. Officials say the pilot,Seankese Johnson, was a Navy veteran who earned his commercial pilot’s license in 2023 and logged over 800 hours of flight time as of March. “Right now, New York Helicopter Tours is under federal investigation for these deaths. But first, I am urging the FAA to pull their operating certificate immediately and cease flights until their full investigation is concluded,” Schumer added. New York Helicopter Tours said it is fully cooperating with the federal investigation. The Democratic senatoralsocalled for increased federal regulations at all New York City-area helicopter tour companies — flights he described as “risky.” “I’m also demanding that the FAA increase what are called ‘ramp inspections’ at other metro-area helicopter tour companies,” he added. “A ramp inspection is a surprise inspection. They show up unannounced and check if things are on the level and the helicopters are doing the right thing.” Schumer’s stance contrasts sharply with that of Mayor Eric Adams, who voiced full support for tourism helicopters in New York City during an interview with Fox 5 on Friday, statinghe would not addfurther regulations. “That is part of the attraction of businesses being in the city, people coming to the city, seeing the city from the air. As part of the attraction, what we must do is make sure it’s safe, make sure it is done correctly,” Adams said.",

    "title": "Trump is in 'excellent health,' White House physician says",
    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — White House physician Sean Barbabella released a memo detailing the results of PresidentDonald Trump’s annual physical on Friday, writing that the president is in “excellent health.” Trump exhibits “robust cardiac, pulmonary, neurological, and general physical function,” Barbabella wrote. “His active lifestyle continues to contribute significantly to his well-being.” “President Trump’s days include participation in multiple meetings, public appearances, press availability, and frequent victories in golf events,” he continued. “President Trump exhibits excellent cognitive and physical health and is fully fit to execute the duties of the Commander-in-Chief and Head of State.” The physical included diagnostic and laboratory testing, according to Barbabella’s memo. The physician also consulted with 14 specialty consultants, he added. Barbabella noted in his diagnostic summary that Trump has scarring on his right hear from a gunshot wound, referring to the assassination attempt on the president in Butler, Pennsylvania, last summer. The memo said Trump’s heart, lungs, eyes, hearing and abdominal exam results were all normal. His blood pressure was slightly elevated, at 128/74, and the dermatological exam revealed “some minor sun damage and a few benign lesions,” the memo said. His routine lab work appeared to be within the normal ranges for blood count, kidney, liver and thyroid tests. Trump’s cholesterol appeared to be well controlled though medication, and his blood sugar is within normal limits. The president also underwent “a comprehensive neurological examination,” which did not indicate any abnormalities, Barbabella wrote. Trump completed the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, a common screening tool for cognitive impairment that typically takes about 10 minutes, achieving a normal result with a score of 30 out of 30, Barbabella said. The presidentpreviously boastedabout his score on that cognitive test, which is designed to assess mild cognitive impairment or early dementia. “It’s like you’ll go: ‘Person, woman, man, camera, TV.’ So they say, ‘Could you repeat that?’ So I said, ‘Yeah. So it’s ‘person, woman, man, camera, TV.’ ‘OK, that’s very good. If you get it in order you get extra points,’”Trump saidin 2020. In November, Trump became the oldest person elected president. The record was previously held by Biden, whose ageprompted concernsfrom voters. The memo also indicated that Trump haslost 20 poundssince his last released physical in 2020. The memo said the president weighs 224 pounds with a body mass index of 28, putting him in the overweight category. The president’s medicines listed in the memo include cholesterol medication and aspirin for heart disease prevention as well as a topical steroid cream as needed for his skin.",

    "article_text": "Former LSU receiver Kyren Lacy, who wasfacing criminal charges stemming from a fatal car accident in December, has died at age 24, a university athletics spokesman said Sunday. While the LSU Athletic Department confirmed Lacy’s death, it did not confirm the cause. WAFB-TV in Baton Rouge, citing an unnamed family member, reported that Lacy, who is from Thibodaux, Louisiana, died in the Houston area. Houston police referred media inquiries to the Harris County Medical Examiner’s office, which did not immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press on Sunday. Lacy, who led LSU in touchdowns receiving with nine last season, had declared for this month’s NFL draft. But his draft stock plummeted after his alleged involvement in an accident in that killed a 78-year-old man in Lafourche Parish, Louisiana. Lacy was allegedly driving recklessly — speeding and passing in a no-passing zone — when a motorist who was swerving to avoid Lacy’s Dodge Charger crashed head-on into another vehicle. Herman Hall of Thibodaux, Louisiana, who was involved in a head-on crash, died after being transported to a hospital, a state police report said. Authorities with State Police Troop C in Gray, Louisiana, said Lacy fled the scene of the accident without calling for help. Lacy was booked with negligent homicide, felony hit-and-run and reckless operation of a vehicle. Lacy played in 12 games for LSU last season and was second on the team in catches with 58 and yards receiving with 866. He declared for the NFL draft just days after the accident and did not play in LSU’s victory over Baylor in the Texas Bowl on Dec. 31.",

    "title": "Mickey Rourke kicked out of 'Celebrity Big Brother' house following 'unacceptable behavior'",
    "article_text": "Actor Mickey Rourke was kicked out of the “Celebrity Big Brother UK” house Saturday following his use of “inappropriate language and instances of unacceptable behaviour,” according to British broadcast network ITV. The 72-year-old’s exit comes about a week into the 24th season and just days after he made comments toward housemate and singer JoJo Siwa that she criticized as homophobic. On Wednesday’s episode of the ITV show, Rourke inquired about Siwa’s sexuality, asking her if she likes girls or boys. When she responded that she likes girls and has a partner, the 72-year-old inferred that he can change her sexuality. “If I stay longer than four days, you won’t be gay anymore,” he said. “I can guarantee I will still be gay and I will still be in a very happy relationship,” Siwa responded. Rourke continued with his commentary, telling the 21-year-old, “I’ll tie you up.” Later on while in conversation with other housemates, Rourke said he would “vote the lesbian out real quick,” referring to Siwa. “That’s homophobic,” said Siwa, who overheard the comment. Rourke then said, “I need a f--,” while gesturing toward Siwa and adding, “I’m not talking to you,” but rather about a cigarette. Given the context, it is unclear whether his choice of words was intended as a casual remark or carried the connotation of a homophobic slur. “Love Island” Season 3 star and TV presenter Chris Hughes came to Siwa’s defense, telling Rourke, “You can’t say that.” Hughes also comforted Siwa when she became emotional and started crying over Rourke’s remarks. Rourke was called into the “diary room,” where he received a formal warning from “Big Brother” for his comments. “Mickey, Big Brother thinks your language was offensive and unacceptable,” the ominous Big Brother voice said to Rourke. The actor responded that he understood, and eventually apologized to Siwa, which she said she appreciated. Siwalater nominated Rourke for the show’s first eviction on Friday. A representative for the singer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. According to a spokesperson for ITV, Rourke’s language and behavior continued Saturday during a disagreement with Hughes amid a task,which are activities inside the Big Brother house that the housemates must accomplish. While no physical altercation took place, ITV told NBC News that Rourke’s behavior toward Hughes was deemed threatening and aggressive. The network did not disclose specifics about the nature of the disagreement. “Mickey Rourke has agreed to leave the Celebrity Big Brother House this evening following a discussion with Big Brother regarding further use of inappropriate language and instances of unacceptable behaviour,” the spokesperson said in a statement Saturday. A representative for Rourke did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “Celebrity Big Brother UK” Season 24 began airing Monday and is expected to wrap up on April 25.",

    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — Ray Dalio, the founder of the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, said Sunday he is \"worried about something worse than a recession\" if President Donald Trump does not properly handle tariffs and other economic policies. \"I think that right now we are at a decision-making point and very close to a recession,\" Dalio said on NBC News' \"Meet the Press.\" \"And I'm worried about something worse than a recession if this isn't handled well.\" Dalio was responding to a question from moderator Kristen Welker about whether the United States would be likely to dip into a recession because of Trump's tariff policies. Dalio warned that \"we have a breaking down of the monetary order,\" an issue he has spoken about at length onsocial media. \"We are having profound changes in our domestic order ... and we're having profound changes in the world order. Such times are very much like the 1930s,\" Dalio said. \"I've studied history, and this repeats over and over again.\" Dalio referred to the combination of tariffs, excessive debt and a \"rising power challenging the existing power\" as changes that are \"very, very disruptive.\" \"How that's handled could produce something that is much worse than a recession,\" he said. Specifically, Dalio has warned recently about what he said was the unsustainable growth of U.S. debt and creditors, such as China, holding too much of it, as well as the decline in U.S. manufacturing, leading to a reliance on other countries for necessary items. Dalio said Sunday the situation could \"be managed very well,\" urging members of Congress to pledge to reduce the budget deficit by a few percentage points to 3% of the gross domestic product, a measure of the country's economic activity. \"If they don't, we're going to have a supply-demand problem for debt at the same time as we have these other problems, and the results of that will be worse than a normal recession,\" he said. Asked to detail his fears about a worst-case scenario, Dalio said he was worried about \"the value of money, internal conflict that is not the normal democracy as we know it, an international conflict in a way that is highly disruptive to the world economy and could even be a military conflict.\" Dalio anticipated the 2008 financial crisis. Bridgewaterwarned in 2007that \"imbedded risks in the system are quite large\" ahead of the eventual financial crisis. A few months later, it said it believed interest rates would rise \"until there is a cracking of the financial system,\" adding that \"no one knows how this financial market contagion will play out.\" Months later, the recession began. Dalio said in along postonXlast week ahead of Trump's temporary reductions in his sweeping tariff increases that while the duties were \"very important developments,\" people are \"mostly overlooking the vastly more important forces that are driving just about everything, including the tariffs.\" \"The far bigger, far more important thing to keep in mind is that we are seeing a classic breakdown of the major monetary, political, and geopolitical orders,\" he wrote. \"This sort of breakdown occurs only about once in a lifetime, but they have happened many times in history when similar unsustainable conditions were in place.\"",

    "article_text": "Luke Garrett A man chats on his phone at the booth for Huawei at the 21st China International Semiconductor Expo in Beijing, in November 2024.Ng Han Guan/APhide caption The Trump administration is considering new semiconductor tariffs, after the White House exemptedcertain electronicsfrom reciprocal tariffs. \"We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigation,\" Trump posted onsocial media. Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, echoed Trump and told CNN that the administration is launching an investigation into semiconductors under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. That section of trade law allows the president, after an investigation, to restrict imports of products that are seen as critical to U.S. national security. \"Semiconductors are the key, important part of a lot of defense equipment,\" Hassett told CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday. \"And there's going to be a semiconductor 232 that studies those things carefully and decides what has to be on-shored in order to protect America.\" Hassett compared these possible semiconductor tariffs to the current25% tariffs on steel and aluminum— which Trump also issued under Section 232. To Hassett, the fact that semiconductors aren't manufactured in the U.S. is a national security issue. \"It actually is the case that it's a very uncomfortable amount of Chinese input in our actual weapons systems,\" Hassett said on CNN. The prospect of additional tariffs on semiconductors,an essential partof many products from cars to cell phones, comes only days after U.S. Customs and Border Protectionlifted what the administration calls \"reciprocal\" tariffson certain electronics, including smartphones and computers. Friday's action lifted steep tariffs on most technology imports, thoughChinese technology continues to face a 20% \"fentanyl\" tariff — what the administration describes as a punitive measure over the nation's role in the international drug trade. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told ABC News that these electronic tariff exemptions are only temporary — because they will soon be replaced by the yet-to-be-announced semiconductor tariff. \"What [Trump] is doing is he's saying they're exempt from the reciprocal tariffs, but they're included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,\" Lutnick told ABC News' Jonathan Karl. \"All those products are going to come under semiconductors, and they're going to have a special-focus type of tariff to make sure that those products get re-shored.\" China is America's top source of electronic products, according tothe U.S. International Trade Commission, followed by Mexico, Taiwan, Vietnam and Malaysia.

Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland claimed victory, becoming the sixth golfer in history to achieve a career Grand Slam. The final round at the Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia began with intense focus on McIlroy and American golfer Bryson DeChambeau in a captivating rematch of last year's U.S. Open, whereDeChambeau narrowly defeated McIlroyby just one stroke. But in a dramatic twist, DeChambeau stumbled on the course while England's Justin Rose delivered a brilliant final round. After 72 holes, Rose and McIlroy were tied for the coveted green jacket — kicking off a nail-biting playoff where the Irishman took victory. Rounding out the top five were Americans Patrick Reed, Scottie Scheffler, and South Korean golfer Im Sung-jae, who along with DeChambeau, tied for fifth. The 2025 Masters is the first major championship of the year, featuring 95 contenders. Notably absent from this year's Masters was five-time green jacket winner Tiger Woods, who wasunable to competeas he is recovering from a ruptured Achilles tendon. Northern Ireland's McIlroy was not just vying for a green jacket this Sunday — he was looking to cement his legacy. A win at The Masters completed the career Grand Slam, making McIlroy one of the elite few to crush all four major golf championships: The PGA Championship, the U.S. Open, The Open Championship and The Masters. Aside from McIlroy, only five men have achieved this feat: South African Gary Player and Americans Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods, according to thePGA Tour.By winning on Sunday, McIlroy also becamethe first playerto secure the career Grand Slam at a Masters tournament. The 2025 Masters marked McIlroy's 17th attempt to win a green jacket. Yet, the 35-year-old Irishman played some of his best golf to date at the tournament. He already made Masters history by becoming the first player tostart a round with six consecutive 3s.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., told a crowd of thousands at a rally in Los Angeles on Saturday that the U.S. was facing a moment of \"extraordinary danger\" as he criticized the political, economic and social policies of President Donald Trump. Sanders, who alsodropped bythe music festival Coachella over the weekend, has been criss-crossing the U.S. to speak out against the new Republican administration. \"We are living in a moment of extraordinary danger,\" he said, \"and how we respond to this moment will not only impact our lives but will impact the lives of our kids and future generations.\" On the latest stop of his national \"Fight Oligarchy\" tour, the lawmaker criticized what he sees as Trump's efforts to advance the interests of billionaire businesspeople over those of the working class. \"I'm no longer talking about how we're moving to oligarchy,\" Sanders told the crowd. \"I'm talking about how we are living today in an oligarchic form of society.\" The same night but on the opposite coast, Trump attended the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) event at the Kaseya Center in Miami, where the crowderupted in applauseas he entered and shouted chants of \"U.S.A.\" He told reporters on his way back to the White House that he felt validated by the reception.

Musical icons Joan Baez and Neil Young were among the performers, in an event that lasted for over five hours. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., another leading Trump critic who has been joining Sanders on the tour, said at the rally thatcorporate interests and lobbyists have an outsize influence on modern American life, driving wealth inequality and making it increasingly challenging for workers to get by. \"The feeling of the water rising up to our throats, the impossibility to afford anything easily, the fear of speaking up, the deeply bitter and toxic division driven more by algorithms on social media than individual thought, the crumbling of our rights and protections,\" Ocasio-Cortez said, \"understand that all of this is what it means and what it feels like to be governed by billionaires.\" Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez will make additional stops on the tour this week in Idaho, California and Montana.

    "title": "White House doctor says Trump is 'fully fit' in medical report",
    "article_text": "Luke Garrett President Trump prepares to watch the Ultimate Fighting Championship at the Kaseya Center on Saturday in Miami, Fla.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide caption President Trump \"exhibits excellent cognitive and physical health and is fully fit,\" according to White HousephysicianCapt. Sean Barbabella. The White House released Trump's three-page medical report Sunday morning following the president's annual physical examination at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Friday. \"President Trump remains in excellent health, exhibiting robust cardiac, pulmonary, neurological and general physical function,\" Barbabella said. Trump, 78, is the oldest president to take the oath of office in the White House. Former President Joe Biden was a few months younger when he started his term and visibly slowed down while in office — sparking political turmoil and concerns about hiscognitive ability. These medical records mark the first detailed information on Trump's health since the assassination attempt against him in Butler, Pa., in July. The physical examination revealed a few \"abnormalities,\" according to Barbabella. The first was \"scarring on the right ear\" from the gunshot wound sustained during theassassination attempt. Barbabella said Trump's \"hearing was normal.\" The second was a \"diverticulosis and a benign polyp\" revealed during a colonoscopy in July. Diverticulosis is when abnormal pouches form in the digestive tract. The White House physician recommended a \"follow-up colonoscopy in three years.\" The medical report also showed that Trump weighs 224 pounds, 20 pounds lighter than he weighed in 2020. And his LDL — \"bad\" cholesterol levels — are now within an \"optimal\" range and lower than last reported in 2020. He is currently taking two cholesterol-control medications: rosuvastatin and ezetimibe. The latter medication was not noted in Trump's 2020 medical report. Trump's vaccines are all \"current,\" but Barbabella did not list specific immunizations. The president's neurological exam \"revealed no abnormalities in his mental status,\" according to Barbabella. Trump was assessed for cognitive function, depression and anxiety. He scored within the normal range in all categories. \"I took a cognitive test. And I don't know what to tell you, other than I got every answer right,\" Trump toldreporterson Friday following his exams. \"I took just a lot of different tests, having to do with the heart, having to do with other things.\" At the end of Trump's medical report, the White House physician said Trump's days are full of meetings, public appearances, press conferences — and \"frequent victories in golf events.\" Presidents are not obligated to share medical data, and many have shrouded their medical records. One week after the Butler assassination attempt, Dr. Ronny Jackson — the president's former doctor and a congressman from Texas — released amemoon Trump's health. Jackson said Trump was shot in the ear and \"is doing well, and he is recovering as expected.\" Jackson also reported that Trump received a \"CT of his head\" and that a hearing exam would be scheduled. Medical data from those exams were not shared publicly at the time, but Sunday's release includes information from these exams. In 2023, Trump released a brief doctor's letter that lacked detailed medical data. But it did say Trump had lost weight and that \"his cognitive exams were exceptional.\" The Trump campaigned highlighted cognitive testing in the lead-up to the election. In his final year as president, Biden's doctors chose not to give him a cognitive exam. During his first term, Trump took a number of physical exam and released his medical data. In 2018, Dr. Jackson gave Trump a glowing report. He said Trump had \"great genes\" and that if he had a healthier diet \"he might live to be 200 years old.\" Jackson recommended the president lose some weight and cut back on fat and carbs. An earlier version of this article misidentified diverticulosis as a condition of inflammation and infection in the digestive tract; that is diverticulitis. Diverticulosis is when abnormal pouches form in the digestive tract. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Here's how to retrain your brain to crave movement more than screen time",
    "article_text": "By Diana Hill , Katy Bowman Clinical psychologist Diana Hill and movement specialist Katy Bowman are the authors ofI Know I Should Exercise But … 44 Reasons We Don't Move and How to Get Over Them. When you're stressed or tired, it's too easy to escape into your phone and start scrolling. But scanning through news headlines or arguments on social media may just stress you out more. Plus, more scrolling time is also more sedentary time, which canquickly compound feeling low. What if instead, you could retrain your brain to crave physical activity for stress relief and a mood boost? Scrolling and using social media can feel good in the short-term because theyactivate the brain's reward pathways,leading to dopamine release and contributing to feelings of pleasure or reinforcement. However, once that spike subsides, dopamine levels dip below baseline, leaving you feeling badly again,prompting you to go back for more. In contrast, physical activity triggers a more gradual release of dopamine alongside other mood-boosting and stress-busting neurochemicals that easestress,depression,anxietyandcognitiveoverload. Minutes spent moving can also reduce fatigue, improve concentration and boostcreativity. Movement gives more than it takes, you just have to learn to choose it. The concept of psychological flexibility can help you build a new habit of reaching for movement instead of your phone. It comes fromAcceptance and Commitment Therapyor ACT, a type of therapy that's beenshown to be effectivefor health behavior change. It's the skill of opening up to uncomfortable emotions, thoughts and feelings and taking value-oriented action even in the face of inner obstacles. Here are six ways to try it. The first step to moving more is training your brain to be emotionally flexible. If you want to stop acting impulsively every time you have an urge to grab the phone, start by noticing the urge and taking a pause. Urge surfing is a mindfulness tool used to help people with addictions cope with cravings without acting on them. Developed bysmoking researcher Alan Marlatt, it involves staying present with your urge, noticing it rise and fall like a wave, without acting on it. Think of yourself as a flexible surfer, nimbly riding a wave of craving — as it grows, it peaks, and it comes back down again. No matter how big the wave is, it will always come back down. And the more you practice urge surfing, the better you get at staying with it. Here's how to do it: Notice the urge.Next time you want to hop on your phone for a news binge, choose to wait it out a little longer. Pay attention to the feeling of craving in your body. What is the sensation of the urge like? Is it a rising feeling? A tingling feeling? A gnawing feeling? Where do you feel it in your body? Your chest? Belly? Head? Stay with it.Ride out the urge, observing it grow or get stronger. What happens to the sensation if you don't act on it? Watch it change like a wave. Don't fight it. Don't add a story.Stay with the pure level of sensation without adding a story to it like \"this feeling will never end\" or \"I can't handle this discomfort.\" If you notice a story like that, go back to paying attention to the sensation in your body again and ride it, like a surfer on a wave. Every urge you surf you train your brain to get better at tolerating discomfort—the precursor to getting yourself to move. What can you do during the minute or two you're riding the wave of phone craving? Practice a simple movement challenge!Research shows that going outside of your comfort zone (also called\"behavioral stretching\") boosts life satisfaction—especially for people who are relatively less happy to start with. So stretching yourself to get active will give you an extra mood boost when you are low. The farther outside your comfort zone the dynamic activity is, the more life enhancing it can be, so go for the silly, skill-building, or challenging moves. Surfers don't just stand on their board, they carve, snap, and cut back through waves. Try it now:Next time you're surfing the urge to use your phone—trying to stand on one leg for thirty seconds. Or do 5 squats and feel your muscles activate. Or, close your eyes, reach your arms overhead and lift up on the tippy toes of both feet. Try a big standing or seated backbend, raising the arms and arching back as far as you can. Or, pick a song from your playlist for a 3-minute dance session that leaves you a little out of breath. When youintentionally savorthings you value — like fun, adventure, community, or creative expression, —you can train your brain to want them more. This works for movement too. Athletes whofocus on the good feelings of their sportreport lower levels of burnout and a healthier overall engagement. Start by identifying types of physical activity you find pleasurable, exciting, or stimulating, that are more satisfying and engaging than phone time. Playing pingpong or Pickleball? Zooming around on a bike? Stretching on an aerial silk? Having a dance party? Taking a walk or run with your friends? Next, take a few moments tosavorthe activity, before, during or after the experience. Shift your attention to and linger on the good feelings movement creates. Pay attention to things like the joy you get from a bout of play with your kid, the way your tissues feel as they are getting stronger after a workout, or the sound of laughter as you throw a frisbee with friends. Humans are wired to see the difficulty in things before spotting the good (an effect called the negativity bias), so give yourself a little time. Spend 10-15 seconds savoring each of the positive aspects of the experience so it can be encoded into your nervous system. With a little repetition, the practice of savoring will train your brain to want to get out there and move. Try it now:Practice savoring now with this shoulder stretch: Reach your hands behind you and clasp them, pulling your shoulder blades together while letting your head nod forward. Then notice what you enjoy about it: Does it feel good on the neck or chest? Relax your breathing or rest your eyes? Create peaceful feelings? Linger on each discovery! The brain has evolved to seek out novelty. This wiring propelled humans out exploring across the globe but it also makes it hard to step away from an endless series of social media videos. If you already have movement modalities you enjoy (perhaps plain old walking or biking is your preference because it's a cheap and convenient exercise), but they keep losing out to the phone, make them more appealing by adding novelty. Try it now:Do you take the same walk day after day? Get flexible with your behavior and change up your route. Take a walk in a location with built-in surprises like a new coffee shop, a sunset, or street with your favorite spring blooms. Add friends or meet-ups: Make taking a walk your first date, your planning meeting meetup, or your parent association gathering. Then add some fresh challenges like a weighted backpack, some push-ups every quarter mile, or some sprints to the end of the block. You can't solve the world's problems by passively absorbing bad news. If you're scrolling because you care, because you want to stay informed and engaged, then let that care move you toward actively participating in solutions. Research indicates thattransforming worry into compassionate actionbenefits both the people you help and your own well-being. The issues that weigh on you the most reflect what matters most in your heart. Instead of staying stuck in worry, ask yourself: Let your answers guide you toward doing something—taking physical action that moves your body and aligns with what you care about most. Try it now:Think of creative – and physical – ways to act on issues you care about. Worried about the environment? Try walking, biking or other human-powered transportation; work in a community garden; or join local restoration projects. If you care about children or families, consider volunteering at an afterschool sports program, or lifting boxes at your foodbank. The weight of the world's global conflicts can be eased by starting a community walking group to discuss global issues or organize a fundraising walk. When you transform the heaviness of the world into physical action, you feel less powerless. When it seems like your values are in conflict—\"I value staying informed\" and \"I value moving my body well,\" it only means you haven't yet discovered where these values can overlap. You might be turning to the phone because life feels uncertain, and being informed makes you feel grounded. But research shows there's another place to head: outside to move. Combining movement with nature can offer you the respite you've been looking for. As the kids say, \"touch grass.\" Try it now:Step outside, take off your shoes, feel the ground beneath you, savor the greenery. And you don't always have to leave the phone behind. Simply mix up your behavior and choose to walk or roll while listening to quality discussions with longer formats, soothing voices, that offer stepwise solutions. Let the act of moving your body in nature remind you that you are part of the world that you are worried about, and that your physical activity can be part of taking action.

    "title": "The biggest trial in Meta's history starts Monday. Here's what to know",
    "article_text": "Bobby Allyn Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, at President Trump's inauguration at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 20, 2025. Meta faces an antitrust trial that begins Monday.Pool/Getty Images/Getty Images North Americahide caption The Federal Trade Commission'sblockbuster antitrust caseagainst Meta kicks off on Monday in a courtroom in Washington. It's the culmination of a nearly six-year investigation into whether the social media giant broke competition laws in acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. At stake is the future Meta's $1.4 trillion advertising business and the prospect of having to spin off its hugely popular services into separate companies — a corporate breakup the likes of which has not been seen since AT&T's telephone monopoly was forced to split apart more than 40 years ago. Lawyers for the FTC and Meta will deliver opening statements on Monday before U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in a trial expected to stretch for seven to eight weeks. Reams of evidence and dozens of witnesses will be scrutinized. The government plans to call CEO Mark Zuckerberg, former chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg and the head of Instagram, Adam Mosseri, to the witness stand. TheFTC arguesthat when Meta acquired Instagram, in 2012, and WhatsApp, two years later, that it was part of a strategy to eliminate competition and maintain monopoly power over the social media market. The government contends that a \"buy or bury\" strategy propelled Meta's acquisitions, leading Meta to gobble up competitors it viewed as threats, or to squash the rivals out of business altogether. In a 2012 internal email government lawyers plan to present, Zuckerbergwrotethat buying Instagram was motivated by a desire to \"neutralize a potential competitor.\" The FTC says this alleged behavior is illegal under federal antitrust laws. The government argues the only way to restore competition to the social media marketplace is for Meta to be forced to unwind its purchase of both Instagram and WhatsApp. The government says divesting those apps will allow smaller social media companies compete for consumers and ad dollars and loosen Meta's grip on the industry. Meta counters that it is being punished for being an innovative and aggressive tech company. It has always competed fairly, Meta's lawyers say, and regulators are attempting to punish the tech titan's runaway success. Lawyers for Meta have also said in court filings that the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp were approved by regulators more than a decade ago. Yet the FTC maintains that Meta was not forthcoming to regulators who cleared the purchases, claiming Meta withheld key information about the company to win the blessing of Washington. Another important facet to Meta's defense is just how crowded the social media world is today, versus 2012 and 2014, when the company made those purchases. Meta says it faces fierce competition from Elon Musk's X, TikTok, Snapchat and many other social media platforms. In a statement ahead of opening statements, Meta said: \"its evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission's action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final.\" TheFTC says it would mean more robust competition among social media startups, and therefore better quality services for everyone. Government lawyers argue that Meta's services have degraded in quality in part because of its dominant position in the marketplace. Regulators also say Meta's privacy protections have lapsed as a result of its alleged monopoly status. To the FTC, a break-up would translate into a more vibrant social media landscape, where new upstarts can go toe to toe with Meta's apps. But Meta contends the opposite: That a breakup would make each of its individual apps less integrated and worse for consumers after many years in which Meta's systems and data have become entwined. This case first started in Trump's first term, in December 2020. That's when Trump still had a bitter feud with Zuckerberg, but the two have been less confrontational of late. Before he won the November election, Trump threatened to throw Zuckerberg in prison, saying if Zuckerberg's platforms did anything to hurt Trump's chances on the campaign trail, he would \"spend the rest of his life in prison.\" Like many other executives in Silicon Valley, Zuckerberg has recently been ingratiating himself with the Trump administration. Zuckeberg has publicly praised Trump; he donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee; heagreed to payTrump $25 million to settle a suit Trump filed for being suspended from Facebook and Instagram in the wake of Jan. 6; and he's made company-wide shifts that align with Trump's priorities, likeending Facebook and Instagram's fact-checking programand rolling back diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Zuckerberg has also made visits to Trump's Mar-a-Lago club reportedly to lobby the president to drop the case. There has been speculation that Trump could abandon the trial and settle with Meta but so far, all indications point to the case sticking. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson has said his lawyers are \"raring to go\" against Meta. That said, he also has said he would \"obey lawful orders\" from the president. In other words, the start of the trial does not take a settlement off the time. The two sides could reach a settlement in the midst of the trial, though legal experts say it is highly unlikely. An earlier headline on this story incorrectly indicated the trial would begin Sunday. It begins Monday. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Soccer-loving 'grannies' go for the GOOOOAAAALLLL in their version of the World Cup",
    "article_text": "By Ryan Lenora Brown , Photos by Samantha Reinders The French team Les Reines du Foot (dressed in red and white, they call themselves the \"queens of soccer\") take on the green-and-white-clad Vuka Soweto team (Vuka means \"wake up\" in Zulu) from South Africa's Johannesburg township. Les Reines du Foot went to lengths to fundraise for their trip to Tzaneen — from selling crepes at markets to posing nude for a calendar.Samantha Reinders for NPRhide caption TZANEEN, SOUTH AFRICA — The stands of the soccer stadium buzzed with anticipation. Vuvuzelas honked like a chorus of drunk geese, and spectators chattered excitedly. The teams were about to take the pitch. But first, match officials had some business to attend to. They hunched over a stack of passports, carefully checking the teams' credentials. \"We don't want to see underage players,\" one official explained gravely. Welcome to the Grannies International Football Tournament, or GIFT, where you're never too old to play. But you may well be too young. Rossina Mathye, 84 (center), was one of the original Vakhegula Vakhegula players — the name for the team from Tzaneen means \"Grandmothers, Grandmothers.\" \"Exercise is good for me,\" she says of her soccer career, which took her to the U.S. in 2010 to play in a special match for older women. Mathye, who has 10 grandchildren and is a great grandmother, no longer plays. \"My knees are sore, so I stopped,\" she says. \"Now I sit and watch. Now I'm one of their biggest supporters.\"Samantha Reinders for NPRhide caption Technically speaking, having grandchildren was optional, but the age requirement was strictly non-negotiable. Under 50? Go find your own stadium of adoring fans. This one was reserved for the nanas, the mamis, the vovos and the gogos. And make no mistake: They came to compete. Once the age checks were done, the opening bars to the FIFA anthem crackled through the stadium speakers, and the players filed onto the field, gripping the hands of the young local players escorting them. On one side stood Togo, dressed head to toe in highlighter yellow. On the other was the United States in white. When the whistle blew, the Americans immediately surged forward. Within seconds, their left forward Pam Woodworth, 72,streaked pastthree Togolese defenders, white ponytail flopping. Before they could regroup, she fed the ball straight to the feet of her center forward, Sue \"Clip\" Clippinger, 78, who drove a hard, high shot into the left corner of the net. The crowd roared. Sue \"Clip\" Clippinger, 78 (in the white t-shirt), is the center forward for the New England Breakers. She's flanked by players from team Togo. \"We've got some of the best chemistry,\" Clippinger says of her team, adding \"I've gotten better at this than when I was 40.\"Samantha Reinders for NPRhide caption \"Goooooooaaaalllll,\" screamed the commentator, a former South African professional player named Ishmael Maluleke. \"What a performance from Granny #4 of the USA. She's dangerous, I'm telling you, she is the USA's [Lionel] Messi.\" For most of the women playing in this tournament, this was a kind of adoration they never dreamed of achieving on the soccer field. Whether they came from rural Kenya or suburban France, many had grown up in worlds where soccer was for the boys. As adults, they had often swallowed their own ambitions to make space for the people who needed them: spouses and partners, children, grandchildren. \"Grannies\" were the stars of the field — and a big part of the crowd. The stadium was packed withgogos(the Zulu word for grandmothers, which is widely and affectionately used throughout southern Africa). Some brought their sewing along, some had a nap when needed, but all cheered loudly for their favorite teams.Samantha Reinders for NPRhide caption Dancers in traditional dress accompanied South Africa's Mbombela team at the opening ceremony of the grannies tournament, which involved a 15-minute walk from the home of tournament founder Beka Ntsanwisiz to the stadium.Samantha Reinders for NPRhide caption Now, however, they were making up for lost time. For four days in early April, teams from seven countries converged on this small South African farming town. \"We are going to play ball,\" sang one South African team in Zulu as they entered the stadium on the tournament's opening day. \"The grannies are going to play soccer.\" Pam Woodworth, Margot Rendall and Anne Snelling-Lee from the New England Breakers walk onto the field for their game against Togo's team Femme Foot. Youth from local soccer clubs held hands with players from each team as they made their way on to the field before each game.Samantha Reinders for NPRhide caption Many of the teams who paraded into the stadium on that sticky, subtropical morning had traveled a great distance to be there. Two teams from Boston blinked back jetlag as they handed out mini American flags to the crowd. A French squad in blue tracksuits shuffled in behind a massivetricoloreemblazoned with their team name:Les Reines du Foot. The queens of soccer. Beka Ntsanwisi (fondly known as Mama Beka) is the local philanthropist who organized the first granny games to help her town's women improve their health. Above: Ntsanwisi, center, wearing the yellow jersey) is given a surprise birthday cake on the last day of the event, when she turned 57.Samantha Reinders for NPRhide caption But in many ways, few had come as far as the hometown team. In 2007,when a Tzaneen radio-host-turned-philanthropist named Beka Ntsanwisi, began organizing a soccer league for older women, the odds were stacked against her. Rossina Mathye, now 84, played on one of those early squads. In those days, she would put on her soccer shorts for practice and then, before leaving her house, tie an ankle-length wrap skirt around her waist. \"You see, in our culture … trousers are for men,\" she says. If the women wanted to play then \"they\" — the men — \"musn't see what's going on.\" As the gospel of granny soccer spread, its momentum became hard to contain. Teams sprouted in towns and villages across the region. In a nod to South Africa's beloved national teams, Bafana Bafana (Boys Boys) and Banyana Banyana (Girls Girls), the players called themselves Vakhegula Vakhegula — Grandmothers Grandmothers. Beauty Mushwane, 72, a grandmother herself, is a proud supporter of the Tzaneen team —Vakhegula Vakhegula. She's cheering them on in their quarter final game against the New England Breakers.Samantha Reinders for NPRhide caption By the time South Africa hosted the World Cup in 2010, the Vakhegula were minor local celebrities. And their star was still rising. A few days after the final whistle, an all-star team of \"grannies\" boarded a flight for Boston. A group of American women had seen clips of them playing and invited them to compete in a tournament organized for older players. Coming back from that trip, Ntsanwisi's head rattled with ideas. If Boston could host a championship like that, why not Tzaneen? Sure, it wasn't exactly an obvious choice — a scruffy farming town of about 15,000 people deep in pick-up truck country, boxed in on all sides by groves of orange and avocado trees, a 5 hour drive from the nearest major international airport in Johannesburg. But then again, Ntsanwisi had built a soccer league from scratch, and now her players were traveling the world. Nothing felt impossible. So she made herself a promise. \"One day,\" she said, \"I'm going to host the World Cup.\" For grannies, that is. It took a decade, but in 2023, the inaugural GIFT kicked off at the soccer stadium down the road from Ntsanwisi's childhood home in the Tzaneen township of Nkowankowa, featuring teams from six countries. The second edition of the Grannies International tourney in 2025 looked poised to be even bigger. Besides the Americans, the French, the Togolese and a dozen South African squads, teams from Kenya and Mozambique marched into Nkowankowa Stadium the first morning of the tournament. But one team was missing. After their bus broke down en route to the tournament, team Zambia hitchhiked to the stadium. Above: The team warms up after their delayed arrival.Samantha Reinders for NPRhide caption As the opening ceremony began with a flurry of speeches, the bus carrying Team Zambia lurched to a stop by the side of the road in southern Zimbabwe, 200 miles away. For more than 48 hours, captain Lillian Zungu had been trying to keep her squad's spirits high despite mounting obstacles. First, two days before the tournament, the bus organized by the Zambian government had set out several hours late. By the time they reached the border with Zimbabwe that night, it was closed. With little other choice, the players slept in the bus. Another day passed driving through Zimbabwe, then another night. By the time they awoke on the third day — the first day of the tournament – \"we felt we are losing it, but we didn't want to give up,\" recalls Zungu, 54, and a chef by profession. But now, less than an hour's drive from the South African border, it seemed their bus had done the giving up for them. It had broken down. Lillian Zungu (in blue), is the captain of the Zambian team (and a professional chef). When the team bus petered out en route to the tournament, she says, \"We felt we are losing it, but we didn't want to give up.\" Above: Zungu jumps on a teammate's back to celebrate a win.Samantha Reinders for NPRhide caption Zungu tried not to think of what could have been. In the months leading up to the tournament, her team had practiced together four times a week. The players were small and fast, with the quick footwork and breakaway speed to match. Watching them play together, Zungu swelled with pride. At times, she couldn't suppress a thought: Maybe they were good enough to win the whole thing. But none of that mattered now. The tournament didn't care how hard they'd trained, and it certainly wasn't going to wait for them to find a mechanic in rural Zimbabwe. With stiff limbs, players descended from the bus. One of the coaches stuck out his thumb. Back in Nkowankowa, the matches got underway. After a nail biter 1-0 victory over Kenya, a team from South Africa threw their goalkeeper on their shoulders and carried her across the field, cheering. Maluleke, the former men's professional player, fired off commentary at the speed and cadence of an auctioneer. \"We're seeing the Maradona of France play today,\" he screamed during one match. Laurance Gonzalez, 58, a player on the French team Les Zamies Foot, shows off her footwork. Gonzalez, pictured above in the foreground, wearing blue and white) won the award for best overall player at the tournament.Samantha Reinders for NPRhide caption \"We say, these women are getting old, they can no longer do certain things, let's leave them,\" says Honorine Kobara Adjoa, the captain of Femme Foot Togo. \"But here they are giving everything of themselves. Being here, it's so motivating.\" Here, for the first time, she was surrounded by soccer-playing women from all over the world. And all of them seemed to share the same wonder she felt, even if they often had few words in common to express it. The Thulamahashe Grannies, a South African team, host a players into the air after their 1-0 victory over Kenya's Mutei Grannies.Samantha Reinders for NPRhide caption But there were other shared languages. After games, players pulled their opponents into sweaty hugs. In the stands, they scrunched together for selfies like teenagers. Every so often, one of the South African teams would spontaneously burst into song, dragging everyone in earshot into an impromptu dance party. \"Once one person starts dancing, everybody tries to follow the dance,\" says Deb Keohan, the captain of the New England Breakers, an offshoot of the American squad that had invited Vakhegula Vakhegula to Boston a decade before. \"And then we were all dancing together. We didn't speak any language in common other than dancing.\" The Mutei Grannies from Kenya celebrate at the end of their game with the French team Le Reines du Foot — the first of the tournament's quarter finals. After the match, both teams embraced.Samantha Reinders for NPRhide caption For many of the players, soccer had also been there at other moments when words failed them. After deaths and divorces, through illness and financial uncertainty, the game was something they could disappear into when the world felt like it was collapsing around them. When Mathye, the player from the original Vakhegula Vakhegula squad, lost her oldest son in 2015, she sat at home tormented, unable to escape his memory. But when she stepped onto a soccer field, for a few minutes the game shoved her sorrow offstage. Playing demanded her full attention, body and mind. \"You see the ball,\" she said, \"not the trouble.\" In the grandstands in Nkowankowa, few people had to be told the importance of grandmothers. On the third day of the tournament, I met Muhluri Mayimele, 17, and her friends. She told me she was a soccer player herself, and hoped to learn some new moves from the players. When I asked about Mayimele's own grandmother, the teenager explained that she lived with her, and \"she teaches me life.\" Mayimele is hardly an outlier.Approximately 40%of all South African children live with their grandparents according to government statistics from 2023, some10 million in total. Hidden inside those numbers is a long and painful history. For generations, Black South Africans lived under racist regimes that viewed them as little more than disposable cheap labor. Confined to impoverished villages and townships, many left home seeking jobs in \"white\" cities and towns. Men frequently went to work in the country's booming gold mines. But women's work was typically domestic. They cleaned, cooked, and raised other people's children, while at home, their own mothers raised theirs. Fikile Sithole, who was raised by hergogofrom the age of 7, says there was no more important person in her childhood. Her granny was \"a mother, a father, [and] a grandmother at the same time.\" And when Sithole wanted to join a boys' soccer team in her neighborhood in Soweto, near Johannesburg, her grandmother didn't tell her that wasn't what girls did. She supported her. Sithole went on to be part ofthe first women's national teamin a democratic South Africa in the 1990s, an accomplishment she credits to the woman who raised her. She is \"why I am where I am today,\" she explained. \"Why I am a strong woman.\" The Mbombela Gogos celebrate after beating the Zambia Grannies.Samantha Reinders for NPRhide caption Now in her mid-50s, Sithole is still playing. In the Grannies International, her team, the Mbombela Gogos, stormed its way to the semi-finals with a style of dance-like footwork and short, quick passes known in South Africa as \"shoeshine and piano.\" \"We play, we move, we travel,\" she said. \"It's going to take us a long time to get old.\" On the final afternoon of the tournament, a row of trophies stood at attention on a table at midfield. One by one, an announcer began calling up the women whose play had marked the tournament — its top goal scorer, its most promising player. Then he came to the award for the top midfielder. Nomsa Mashego, a 58-year-old grandmother of 2, is a member of South Africa's Mbombela team. She won the \"most promising player of the tournament.\" Mashego has been playing soccer for 10 years. In 2006 she was partially paralyzed after a stroke and she says that her arms and leg are now 100% \"because I play ball.\" Thinking of her own mortality, she says, \"It's better to play ball than go to ground,\" she says.Samantha Reinders for NPRhide caption \"It's Lillian from Zambia!\" he exclaimed, and suddenly the entire Zambian squad was on its feet. There they were: the team that almost didn't make it at all, yelling their lungs out for the woman who had been their playmaker, on and off the field. After hitching rides to the border in passing mini-bus taxis, the team had arrived in Tzaneen at 10 p.m. on the first day of play, long after their scheduled match. But the organizers agreed to squeeze the game in the following morning, and the show went on. The Zambians played two hard-fought games and narrowly missed out on a quarterfinal berth. Members of the Boston Breakers hoist the trophy after beating the French team \"Les Zamies\" in a penalty shootout.Samantha Reinders for NPRhide caption It was the New England Breakers who took the cup, defeating Les Zamies from France in soccer's most heartbreaking tie-breaker, a penalty shoot-out. But team Zambia celebrated its own triumph. \"We are happy that we didn't give up,\" Zungu said. \"I love my team because we don't give up.\"",

    "article_text": "Back in March, Marvel launched a crossover comic featuring its heroesgoing up against Godzilla. That miniseries only has two issues out right now, but it’s certainly not a one-and-done, because there’s already a sequel book coming, and it sounds like theKing of the Monstersis really playing for keeps this time. On Friday, Marvel announced the five-issue event seriesÂGodzilla Destroys the Marvel Universefrom Gerry Duggan (X-Men) and Javier GarrÃ³n (Avengers) wherein the big lizard has woken up again for the first time in years. After losing their first fight against him, the heroes of the Marvel universe reach out to its biggest villains to see if they’ve got any good ideas for how to stop him. (The Fantastic Four, X-Men, Spider-Man, and Avengers are all accounted for, but the villains they’ll team with are currently under wraps.) All the while, Godzilla himself is stomping around Earth and other realms like the Dark Dimension. And if that weren’t enough, the press release teases he has some kind of connection to Vibranium over in Wakandaâbetween this and the Predator last year, the resource sure is drawing a lot of attention from outside players. Like its predecessor,DestroysÂis part of a larger celebration for Godzilla’s 70th anniversary. Toho International general manager Kristin Parcell called back to the character’s old crossovers with Marvel decades ago and called this newÂ miniseries “the perfect way to celebrate 70 years of the King of Monsters. Our continued collaboration with Marvel, bringing Godzilla into the vast Marvel Universe, guarantees an unmatched, electrifying experience for fans of both legendary franchises.” If that sounds like your monster jam,ÂGodzilla Destroys the Marvel UniverseÂstomps into stores on July 16, two weeks afterÂGodzilla vs.Âwraps up on July 2.

    "title": "For the First Time, Artificial Intelligence Is Being Used at a Nuclear Power Plant",
    "article_text": "Diablo Canyon, Californiaâs sole remaining nuclear power plant,has been left for deadon more than a few occasions over the last decade or so, and is currently slated to begin a lengthy decommissioning process in 2029. Despite its tenuous existence, the San Luis Obispo power plant received some serious computing hardware at the end of last year: eight NVIDIA H100s, which are among the worldâs mightiest graphical processors. Their purpose is to power a brand-new artificial intelligence tool designed for the nuclear energy industry. Pacific Gas and Electric, which runs Diablo Canyon,announced a deal with artificial intelligence startup Atomic Canyonâa company also based in San Luis Obispoâaround the same time, heralding it in a press release as âthe first on-site generative AI deployment at a U.S. nuclear power plant.â For now, the artificial intelligence tool named Neutron Enterprise is just meant to help workers at the plant navigate extensive technical reports and regulations â millions of pages of intricate documents from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that go back decades â while they operate and maintain the facility. But Neutron Enterpriseâs very existence opens the door to further use of AI at Diablo Canyon or other facilities â a possibility that has some lawmakers and AI experts calling for more guardrails. PG&E is deploying the document retrieval service in stages. The installation of the NVIDIA chips was one of the first phases of the partnership between PG&E and Atomic Canyon; PG&E is forecasting a âfull deploymentâ at Diablo Canyon by the third quarter of this year, said Maureen Zawalick, the companyâs vice president of business and technical services. At that point, Neutron Enterpriseâwhich Zawalick likens to a data-mining âcopilot,â though explicitlynota âdecision-makerââwill be expanded to search for and summarize Diablo Canyon-specific instructions and reports too. âWe probably spend about 15,000 hours a year searching through our multiple databases and records and procedures,â Zawalick said. âAnd that’s going to shrink that time way down.â Trey Lauderdale, the chief executive and co-founder of Atomic Canyon, told CalMatters his aim for Neutron Enterprise is simple and low-stakes: he wants Diablo Canyon employees to be able to look up pertinent information more efficiently. âYou can put this on the record: the AI guy in nuclear says there is no way in hell I want AI running my nuclear power plant right now,â Lauderdale said. That âright nowâ qualifier is key, though. PG&E and Atomic Canyon are on the same page about sticking to limited AI uses for the foreseeable future, but they arenât foreclosing the possibility of eventually increasing AIâs presence at the plant in yet-to-be-determined ways. According to Lauderdale, his company is also in talks with other nuclear facilities, as well as groups who are interested in building out small modular reactor facilities, about how to integrate his startupâs technology. And heâs not the only entrepreneur eyeing ways to introduce artificial intelligence into the nuclear energy field. In the meantime, questions remain about whether sufficient safeguards exist to regulate the combination of two technologies that each have potential for harm. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission was exploring the issue of AI in nuclear plants for a few years, but itâs unclear if that will remain a priority under the Trump administration. Days into his current term,Trump revoked a Biden administration executive orderthat set out AI regulatory goals, writing that they acted âas barriers to American AI innovation.â For now, Atomic Canyon is voluntarily keeping the Nuclear Regulatory Commission abreast of its plans. Tamara Kneese, the director of tech policy nonprofit Data & Society’s Climate, Technology, and Justice program, conceded that for a narrowly designed document retrieval service, âAI can be helpful in terms of efficiency.â But she cautioned, âThe idea that you could just use generative AI for one specific kind of task at the nuclear power plant and then call it a day, I don’t really trust that it would stop there. And trusting PG&E to safely use generative AI in a nuclear setting is something that is deserving of more scrutiny.â For those reasons, Democratic Assemblymember Dawn Addisâwho represents San Luis Obispoâisnât enthused about the latest developments at Diablo Canyon. âI have many unanswered questions of the safety, oversight, and job implications for using AI at Diablo,â Addis said. âPreviously, I have supported measures to regulate AI and prevent the replacement and automation of jobs. We need those guardrails in place, especially if we are to use them at highly sensitive sites like Diablo Canyon.â Before Lauderdale moved into artificial intelligence and nuclear energy, he founded a health care software company called Voalte, which was designed to help hospital staff communicate over iPhones, reducing their reliance on loudspeaker paging and desktop computer systems. At the time, circa 2008, Lauderdale said his pitch was met with worries and resistance from hospital staff. He likes to draw parallels between that experience, which culminated in 2019 when he sold his company to a hospital bed manufacturer for $180 million, and the pushback heâs heard about Atomic Canyon. In 2021, Lauderdale moved to San Luis Obispo so he, his wife, and kids could be closer to his wifeâs family in Northern California. Lauderdale told CalMatters he didnât realize how close Diablo Canyon was to his new home until after he relocated. It was through meeting Diablo Canyon workers out in the community, he says, that he learned more about nuclear energy and landed on his next startup idea. Atomic Canyon launched in 2023 with a task of downloading roughly 53 million pages of publicly available Nuclear Regulatory Commission documents, which encapsulate all of Americaâs nuclear energy fleet and are available on a database called ADAMS. That process started around January 2024, after Lauderdale gave the Nuclear Regulatory Commission a heads-up about what Atomic Canyon was planning to do: âI reached out to [the commission] just to say, hey, I’m Trey Lauderdale, American citizen, entrepreneur. We’re going to start building AI in the nuclear space, and we just wanted to make sure the NRC was aware that when they see all these downloads, it’s not a foreign actor or someone trying to do anything bad to their system.â Lauderdale said the commission supported Atomic Canyonâs efforts. After downloading the data, Atomic Canyon partnered with the Department of Energyâs Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee to kick off research and development. The lab houses the Frontier supercomputer, which was the worldâs fastest when it debuted two years ago. Atomic Canyon used Frontier to build a form of AI that can perform âsentence-embedding models,â which Lauderdale says are capable of processing nuclear jargon and are less likely to âhallucinate,âor answer a question using fabrications. âYou basically teach the artificial intelligence how to understand nuclear words, their context, what different acronyms mean,â he said. In the spring of 2024, Lauderdale and PG&E representatives kicked off formal discussions about how Atomic Canyon could be of use at Diablo Canyon. PG&E soon invited Atomic Canyon staff to visit the nuclear facility, where they shadowed employees for a few weeks, âobserving where there were operational inefficiencies that we could try to target with AI,â Lauderdale said. Then, in September 2024, Atomic Canyon announced the completion of testing on its AI, referred to as âFERMIâ; these models, which are open-source, are what collectively make up the Neutron Enterprise software. A few months later, in November, came the first-of-its-kind announcement with PG&E. PG&E brought in NVIDIA hardware to Diablo Canyon to run FERMI. Zawalick and Lauderdale both told CalMatters that the Neutron Enterprise software is being installed without cloud access so that sensitive, internal, documents donât leave the site. Zawalick said their data storage policies meet all Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Department of Energy nuclear information requirements, and will be continuously tested and inspected. Initial Neutron Enterprise users are currently only using the software to search through publicly available regulatory data. PG&E and Atomic Canyon hope to initiate the next phase of Neutron Enterpriseâs rollout in the third quarter of 2025, when more on-site employees will be able to use the service, and it will be able to search for and summarize internal documents by utilizing optical character recognition (which allows more documents to be indexed), and retrieval-augmented generation (which allows more flexible querying). According to Lauderdale, the use of artificial intelligence to speed up document searches isnât risky. If AI fails to find the information sought by a worker, the person can âjust fall back to the previous way they would search,â he said, referring to sifting through multiple on-site databases and sometimes manually pulling paper files. Neutron Enterprise also generates short summarizations of documents while users are searching databases, and itâs possible those summarizations could produce incorrect information, too â but they would not alter the actual contents/instructions contained within the documents that are read over by workers. CalMatters asked a number of state lawmakers â especially those near Diablo Canyon â what they think of Atomic Canyonâs first-of-its-kind partnership with PG&E. The consensus response was positive, though tailored to Neutron Enterpriseâs currently limited functionality. Malibu Democratic Sen. Henry Stern, a member of the Senate Energy Committee, told CalMatters heâs âreticent to rain on AI tools that can do better grid management,â so long as proper safety protocols are followed. Democratic Sen. John Laird, who represents San Luis Obispo, took an even-keel stance: âAs AI integration expands, so does its energy demandâ¦ Balancing technological advancement with public safety, environmental stewardship, and regulatory oversight will be critical in shaping AIâs role in our stateâs energy future,â he said. San Francisco Sen. Scott Wiener, whoseambitious AI safety legislation was vetoedby the governor last year, agrees with his Democratic colleagues: âIf AI can help improve the day-to-day efficiencies of Diablo Canyon, that’s great.â Out of five San Luis Obispo County Board of Supervisors, three responded to requests for comment. Supervisor Bruce Gibson said that âusing AI to access and organize required information in this situation makes sense,â but he stressed the need for transparency and public updates from PG&E. Supervisor Heather Moreno said that itâs a good thing PG&E will be taking âadvantage of a âsuperchargedâ search engineâ¦ As it will not be used for operations, this appears to be a good first step in using AI at Diablo Canyon.â And Supervisor Dawn Ortiz-Legg, a former PG&E employee, said she was âencouragedâ that Diablo Canyon was working with Atomic Canyon âto navigate the enormous amounts of data collected from thousands of pages of audits and reports.â However innocuous the use of AI at Diablo Canyon today, there are big-picture concerns about how the technology could later be used there and at other facilities. âI think we have to be really careful when we talk about broader AI decision-making,â Wiener said. âThat’s why it’s really, really important to beef up government capacity to set standards around use of AI in sensitive contexts such as a nuclear power plant.â In November 2024, Nuclear Regulatory Commission Inspector General Robert J. Feitel came to the same conclusion. He identified âplanning for and assessing the impact of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning on nuclear safety and securityâas one of the nine major challenges the agency faced.The month prior,a commission-sponsored reportby the Southwest Research Institute looked into artificial intelligence-related âregulatory gapsâ in the nuclear energy industry. It found fewer than 100 gaps, but also noted that âno practical AI standards were identifiedâ from outside sources that could help address those gaps. The report recommended developing a number of AI-specific guides. Atomic Canyon and PG&E appear to be keeping the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in the loop on their own accord. âI wouldn’t claim we have an official relationship with the NRC, but we make sure to brief them on what we’re doing, because, being newer in the nuclear industry, surprises are bad,â Lauderdale said. He believes that the nuclear energy industryâs cautious approach will, in itself, act as a ânatural bufferâ against overly invasive or dangerous AI integrations, though he conceded that âas we start to traverse into applications that do introduce risk, we absolutely will want guardrails and regulation to make sure that AI is properly deployed.â When CalMatters first spoke with PG&Eâs Zawalick in December, she mentioned sheâd just recently met with the Nuclear Regulatory Commissionâs AI working group, an advisory committee of sorts. Since then, she hasnât had further discussions with the commission about AI regulations, she recently told CalMatters. And the Diablo Canyon Independent Safety Committee, astate-appointedsafety group that inspects the nuclear facility and provides recommendations about its operations, first learned about PG&Eâs deal with Atomic Canyon through media reports, the committeeâs legal counsel Bob Rathie told CalMatters. In December 2024 and January 2025, a committee representative participated in two fact-finding visits about Neutron Enterprise, meeting with PG&E workers to learn more about the software. The committee concluded from those visits that Diablo Canyonâs use of artificial intelligence is âpositive,â and they have no safety concerns at this time. Lauderdale spoke to CalMatters while traveling to another nuclear facility, though he couldnât reveal which one. He said that Atomic Canyon is âin discussionsâ with âmany other nuclear organizations,â and that some âreally exciting announcementsâ will come later this year. Through Atomic Canyonâs partnership with Diablo Canyon, he wants to demonstrate a proof of concept for existing nuclear facilities, as well as companies interested in building or re-commissioning nuclear facilities. He hopes Diablo Canyonâs lifecycle is expanded beyond the current decommissioning timeline, but if itâs not, his software can be used for the facilityâs decommissioning process, he said. âAs we gain more trust in the product and build out more capabilities, we will pick other non-risky activities that will take off one-by-one, and we’ll keep creating more value with this new technology,â he said. Responding to questions about whether the rollout of AI at Diablo Canyon has had sufficient oversight, Lauderdale reiterated that his startup product does not have a significant operational role. âI consider our company the leader in deploying AI and nuclear,â he said, before giving a future-facing assessment that left the door just slightly ajar: âand I think we will not have AI running nuclear power plants for a very long time.â This article wasoriginally published on The Markupand was republished under theCreative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivativeslicense.

    "title": "Beyond Showerheads: Trump’s Attempts to Kill Appliance Regulations Cause Chaos",
    "article_text": "This story was originally published byProPublica. ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up forThe Big Story newsletterto receive stories like this one in your inbox. Donald Trump makes no secret of his loathing for regulations that limit water and energy use by home appliances. For years, he has regaled supporters at his campaign rallies with fanciful stories about their impact. He is so exercised by the issue that, even as global stock markets convulsed Wednesday in response to his tariff plans, Trump took time out to issue anexecutive order titled âMaintaining Acceptable Water Pressure in Showerheads.â Contemporary shower fixtures are only one of the items that rankle the president, who complains that âthereâs no water coming and you end up standing there five times longer,â making it difficult to coif his âperfectâ hair. He has frequently denounced dishwashers that he claims take so long and clean so poorly that âthe electric bill is ten times more than the waterâ; toilets that require flushing âten or 15 timesâ; and LED lightbulbs, which he faults for making him look orange. In his first term, Trump pursued an array of gimmicks to try to undermine the rules. His moves were opposed by industry and environmental groups alike. If itâs possible for regulations to be popular, these ones are. They have cut Americaâs water and energy consumption, reduced global-warming emissions and saved consumers money. Legal prohibitions stymied most of Trumpâs maneuvers back then, and the Biden administration quickly reversed the steps Trump managed to take. Trumpâs executive order on showerheadsgenerated headlines, but itâs likely to have little effect (more on that later). Far more consequential steps have been taken outside the Oval Office. With the aid of Elon Muskâs Department of Government Efficiency team, Trump appears to be attempting an end run that could succeed where his past attempts failed: by simply terminating the consulting contract that the Department of Energy relies on to develop and enforce the rules. In late March, DOGEâs âwall of receiptsâ stated that it had âdeletedâ a Department of Energy contract for Guidehouse LLP (a PricewaterhouseCoopers spinoff) for âAppliance Standards Analysis and Regulatory Support Service,â producing a listed savings of $247,603,000. That item has now disappeared from the DOGE website, and its current status remains unclear. This has produced confusion for everyone from appliance manufacturers to government officials to the contractors paid to enforce the rules. If the contract is indeed canceled, experts told ProPublica, it would cripple the governmentâs efficiency standards program, which relies on the consulting firmâs technical expertise and testing labs to update standards, ensure compliance and punish violators. âIt would have a huge impact,â said George Washington University law professor Emily Hammond, who helped run the program as deputy general counsel at the Department of Energy and now serves on its appliance standards advisory committee. âDOE does not have the internal capacity to do that work. Taking that away pulls the rug out from under the agencyâs ability to run that regulatory program.â Appliance manufacturers seem almost as concerned. âThis is not a positive development,â said Josh Greene, vice president for government affairs at A.O. Smith, the largest manufacturer of water heaters in the U.S. Terminating the Guidehouse contract, he said, would create âa wild Wild Westâ where âupstart manufacturersâ are free to import poor-quality products because âthey know thereâs no one to enforce the rules. Thatâs not good for American manufacturing and itâs not good for consumers.â The Department of Energy has made no public attempts to clarify the matter. An agency spokesperson did not respond to ProPublicaâs requests for comment. Emails to DOGE and the White House brought no reply. And Guidehouse officials, reportedly eager to lay low, also offered no response to multiple requests for comment. The governmentâs efficiency requirements originated with the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, signed into law in 1975, when the concern was an energy shortage, not global warming. Today, the Department of Energy is required to set rules for energy and water use by more than 70 appliances and commercial products sold in the U.S. The agency must consider imposing stricter standards for each product every eight years, based on what is âtechnologically feasible and economically justified.â Manufacturers then have three to five years to make their products measure up. The Energy Department typically stiffens a requirement only after years of study, comment, negotiation and testing (and sometimes litigation) among industry, consumer and environmental groups. The law also includes an âanti-backslidingâ provision that bars relaxation of standards that have been finalized. Guidehouse and its subcontractors have for years performed virtually all the necessary technical work; they also maintaina certification databasethat U.S. authorities use to keep illegal products from being imported. Republican lawmakers, anti-regulation advocates and right-wing media have long decried the efficiency rules as an impingement on personal freedom, limiting product choice. The early rollout of water-throttling products produced some of the issues Trump complains about, lampooned in a1996 âSeinfeldâ episodetitled âThe Shower Head.â But in the decades since, the standards have been widely embraced, dramatically cutting energy and water consumption, reducing emissions and providing plenty of attractive consumer choices. In 2023,Consumer Reportsfound that âeven the simplest and least expensive showerheads can provide a satisfying shower.âDishwashersandclothes washersclean better while using less than half as much water and energy as they once did. The transition to LED light bulbs, nearly complete, is estimated to have cut energy bills by $3 billion a year and eliminated the needfor about 30 large power plants. In January, days before Trump returned to office, aDepartment of Energy reportestimated that the efficiency standards are now saving the average American household about $576 a year on their utility bills, while cutting the nationâs energy consumption by 6.5% and water consumption by 12%. A 2022 survey by the Consumer Federation of America found that76% of Americanssupport the government setting efficiency standards for appliances. None of that has slowed Trumpâs attacks. During his first term, the Department of Energy ignored legal deadlines for considering efficiency updates on 28 products, blocked the long-planned rollout of new lightbulb rules and sought to bypass finalized appliance standards through byzantine legal maneuvers. Among other things, the Energy Department announced special new âproduct classesâ for dishwashers, clothes washers and dryers that completed their ânormalâ cycle in an hour or less. This would exempt any such âshort-cycleâ devices that were introduced from the existing limits on water and energy use. Manufacturers never brought those models to market. Most existing appliances already had a âshort cycleâ option that did their job well; those short on time simply had to push that button. And by mid-2022, Bidenâs Energy Department had reversed Trumpâs regulatory moves. The department went on to issue an array of tightened home appliance rulesjointly recommendedby industry and consumer groups; most were finalized early enough to be immune from congressional rollback. This didnât stop Trump from boasting on the 2024 campaign trail that he had changed everything during his first term. He vowed to fix it all again when he returned to the White House. âEliminate energy efficiency standards for appliancesâ was on Project 2025âs list of âneeded reforms.â Sure enough, on his first day back in the White House, Trump issued two executive orders targeting the efficiency rules. On Feb. 11, he posted on Truth Social: âI am hereby instructing Secretary Lee Zeldin to immediately go back to my Environmental Orders, which were terminated by Crooked Joe Biden, on Water Standard and Flow pertaining to SINKS, SHOWERS, TOLIETS, WASHING MACHINES, DISHWASHERS, etc., and to likewise go back to the common sense standards on LIGHTBULBS, that were put in place by the Trump Administration, but terminated by Crooked Joe. I look forward to signing these orders.â (In fact, the rules Trump cited were issued and enforced by the Department of Energy, not the Environmental Protection Agency, where Administrator Zeldin presides.) None of the standards Trump listed were subject to an executive order, or any other kind of rapid rollback. In simple terms, Trump did not have the legal authority to change these rules. No matter. Energy Secretary Chris Wright â who had listed âaffordability and consumer choice in home appliancesâ among histop nine prioritiesâ took up the cause. Three days after Trumpâs Truth Social post, Wrightannouncedthat the Department of Energy was postponing âseven of the Biden-Harris administrationâs restrictive mandates on home appliances,â which âhave driven up costs, reduced choice and diminished the quality of Americansâ home appliances.â Wrightâs list of seven affected âhome appliancesâ actually included three types of commercial equipment and three other regulations long past the point where they could be undone. That left only one household-product regulation that could be challenged. It involved an item that seemed like an improbable symbol of âfreedomâ and âconsumer choiceâ: the tankless, gas-fueled hot water heater. The vast majority of U.S. homes have traditional water heaters with 40- to 50-gallon tanks. By contrast, tankless gas products represent 10% of sales. They are about the size of a carry-on suitcase and heat a stream of water on demand. Theyâre energy-efficient and roughly twice as expensive as standard heaters. But the rules governing tankless gas water heaters were vulnerable because they were issued in the final weeks of Bidenâs term. That meant lawmakers could reverse them under the Congressional Review Act, which allows lawmakers to block a recently enacted agency rule, if a resolution to do so passes both houses and is signed by the president. Appearing atthe Conservative Political Action Conferenceon Feb. 20, Wright drew cheers as he offered a Trumpian litany â âMy dishwasher has to run for two hours now, and at the end I got to clean the dishesâ â before turning to hot water heaters. âWe have a factory in the southeastern part of the United States that employs hundreds of people to build a particularly popular product these days,â Wright said. âIt is a tankless water heater powered by natural gas,â which he described as âselling like hotcakes.â So, what did the Biden administration do, he asked. âThey passed a regulation that would make that product illegal, and that company would be dead.â But under Trump, declared Wright, waving his arms, âwe are fixing that problem. That factory is staying open. â¦ America is back, baby!â Wright returned to âthe hot-water thingâ ina FoxBusiness interviewa month later. Assailing ânanny-state, crazy, top-down mandates that makes it more expensive for American consumers and businesses to buy what they want,â he said the new rule was going to shut down a factory âjust built in the southeast United States.â Wright acknowledged that U.S. law bars elimination of other efficiency updates that he and Trump have targeted because theyâve already been finalized. âWe canât officially get rid of them,â he commented. âSo we just pushed back the enforcement date, hopefully, to never.â Wrightâs portrayal omitted significant details. The administrationâs actions involve a single beneficiary: Rinnai, a Japanese appliance company with $3.3 billion in revenues last year. In 2022, Rinnai opened a $70 million factory south of Atlanta, where about 250 U.S. workers build ânon-condensingâ tankless gas water heaters, a major moneymaker for the company. âNon-condensingâ tankless heaters are less efficient and less expensive than âcondensingâ tankless heaters, which reuse heat from their exhaust gases. As a result, Rinnai wouldnât be able to continue selling them when the new standards went into effect in December 2029. That, however, wasnât going to put the company out of business; it wasnât likely to shut down its U.S. factory, either, though Rinnai raised that specter in government filings where its U.S. president warned the new standards would make the Georgia plant âlargely obsoleteâ¦ eliminatingâ all its jobs. Rinnai sells a broad array of products across the world. It also already sold condensing tankless heaters in the U.S. that met the new standard and were imported from Japan. And Rinnai had plans to make them in Georgia, according to the companyâsmost recent annual report. (Rinnai agreed to make its U.S. chief, Frank Windsor, available for an interview with ProPublica, then canceled twice at the last minute. The company ultimately declined to respond to questions about its public representations.) Nonetheless, the company, now backed by the Trump administration, has pursued a multitrack campaign to roll back the new standards. Its efforts appear to be on the point of success. A resolution has passed the House and won Senate approval on Thursday. Rinnai has spent $375,000 on Washington lobbyists since 2023, according to disclosure reports. The company also joined with Republican attorneys general in a court challenge to the energy rule. Three major Rinnai competitors supported the Biden-era regulations. Wisconsin-based A.O. Smith has actively lobbied against Rinnaiâs effort to win a congressional rollback. Greene said blocking the standard will âdisadvantageâ U.S. companies, which have already invested in more efficient condensing technology, by allowing continued sale of Rinnaiâs less expensive competing products. âIn this time of âAmerica First,â it just seems to us a shame that where weâre heading is rewarding foreign manufacturers,â Greene said. âThere should be a level playing field.â Meanwhile the administrationâs campaign has expanded to multiple fronts. On Wednesday, the Department of Energy announced a review of its procedures for energy standards, which one expert described as a reprise of the first Trump administrationâs attempts to create procedural hurdles to updating efficiency standards. Then there was the executive order on showerheads that same day. It, too, seeks to revive a move by the first Trump administration: to circumvent the limits on waterflow by redefining âshowerheadsâ to include multiple nozzles, each of which could emit as much water as the entire showerhead was previously allowed. The Biden-era Energy Department killed that regulation, and Trump is attempting to bring it back while proclaiming that ânotice and comment is unnecessary because I am ordering the repeal.â That order will have virtually no effect because manufacturers have little interest in making showerheads that exceed the current limits, according to Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, a nonprofit coalition of groups that support the efficiency rules. âThe president is asserting king-like authority,â he added, about Trumpâs claim that he does not have to follow administrative procedures. In the end, DOGE could have more of an impact than a would-be monarch, if itâs able to kill the Guidehouse contract. Then, deLaski said, âit would be next to impossible for DOE to enforce its efficiency standards.â Doris Burke,Mark OlaldeandPratheek Rebalacontributed research. appliancesDonald Trump Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Marvel Really Wants You to Know Thunderbolts’ Skyscraper Scene is Real",
    "article_text": "The last few weeks, Marvel’s being going out of its way to promoteÂThunderboltsÂas not your average MCU outing. It’s got big-name actors, sure, but they’re from mid-size hits likeA Different ManandÂMidsommar,Âand creative forces behindÂBeef, Minari,ÂandÂEverything Everywhere All at Once. Now, it’s telling you it’s adifferent type of filmby hyping up the realness of its stunts. Y’know that one scene in the trailers ofYelenafalling off the Merdeka 118, a skyscraper in Kuala Lumpur? That’s a very real thing Florence Pugh did; in the featurette, she talked about being excited for that particular moment since she first read the script. According to director Jake Schreier, Disney’s health and safety team was understandably hesitant to do thisâat 678.2 meters (or 2,227 feet), the Merdeka is the second-tallest building in the world behind the Burj Khalifaâbut Schreier felt the film needed something needed “a little more weight and surprise.” What likely helped sell it to Disney was Pugh’s insistence on doing it (she “loooooves heights,” apparently), and “taking it upon herself to elevate it because she trusts our amazing team.” Check it and the official version that’ll open the movie down below. Now that is a pretty cool bit of stunt work, and you can tell everyone in the production took doing thisÂveryseriously. Turns out, that’s not the only real bit of work in the film: the scene where Yelena walks away after the floor of a building explodes is also real. Schreier revealed they shot that hours after breaking down the Merdeka rig. There’ve been aÂlotÂof explosions in the MCU over the years, so seeingÂThunderboltsÂget to make that and the Merdeka sequence real is a nice change of pace. It’s an interesting time for this featurette to dropâstunt performers will finallyget Oscar recognitionin a few years, and Marvel would certainly likewants some Academy gold.

    "title": "Bungie’s New Marathon Game Has an Amazing Short Film",
    "article_text": "After a decadefocusing solelyon its ongoing shared world shooterDestiny,ÂBungie is reviving its old sci-fi shooter seriesÂMarathon. As part of the game’sofficial unveilingon Saturday, the developer released a cinematic short that may be one of the coolest videos of 2025. Written and directed by Spanish animator Alberto Mielgoâbest known forÂLove, Death, & RobotsÂand art director forÂSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verseâthe eight-minute video lays out the intriguing, violent, and more than a little unsettling sci-fi world of this newÂMarathon. As it opens, something…weird happens on the planet Tau Ceti IV. Some colonists are crushed by satellite debris from a meteor shower, others die where they stand in gruesome fashion. Even creepier is that we see these deaths span across several decades, from 2794 to 2812 and 2827. We then jump ahead to 2893, where cybernetic beingsâformer humans who have machine bodies crafted by cybernetic silkwormsâare looting the colony for anything they can get their hands on to sell to various factions still stationed on the planet. This second part of the cinematic, which features narration fromFinal Fantasy XVI’sÂBen Starr, is meant to show youMarathon’sÂgameplay loop. Since this is a multiplayer extraction shooter, players will take on the role of cybernetic mercenaries called Runners to steal data, research, and the like for Tau Ceti’s various factions, and shoot each other (or the planet’s wildlife or security bots) to get loot and escape safely. But the main point of this cinematic is take you into Bungie’s new sci-fi world and offer glimpses of what you’ll see as you shoot each other into scrap. Vibes and atmosphere have always been one of Bungie’s strong suits, and what’s really interesting about this short is seeing Runners like Glitch (Erica Lindbeck) and Void (Elias Toufexis) be aware that something about Tau Ceti and their being there iswrong,Âbut unable to fully vocalize why. Whatever’s drawn them there has its hooks in them deep, and not even getting shot to bits will keep them from keeping on after they’ve been rebuilt. Fancy cinematics are nothing new for games at this point in the medium’s life. But for Bungie,ÂMarathonÂfeels like a massive step forward from what the studio’s previously done withÂHaloÂandÂDestiny. The game’s aesthetic is pretty striking and distinct from anything seen in major sci-fi games in quite some time. As cold as everything looksâthis is, after all, a world shaken by its inhabitants mysteriously vanishing, possibly because of somethingÂ roaming the hallwaysâthere’s a vibrancy to the colors that don’t clash as much as you’d think. It’s also just shot differently than any Bungie cutscene to date; the camera being so close to the Runners provides intimatcy they’re not getting (or ignoring) from each other and makes the scenes where they die hit that much harder. For many, this short will be enough to sell them onMarathonÂalone, and it’s likely Sony plans to use snippets of it to promote the game on TV. For others, the short has done everything right in terms of getting them hooked…but it’s a strictly multiplayer game with no single-player offering to speak of. That’s a real shame, since at their best, Bungie’s story campaigns were memorable and have stayed with players for years. It’s easy to imagine this being so engrossing if we were able to just be on Tau Ceti and investigate its secrets in an engaging narrative with tight gunplay andsome sweet music. Ah, wellâfor the multiplayer heads,ÂMarathonÂwill run to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on September 23. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Cholera Outbreak Traced to Holy Water From Ethiopia",
    "article_text": "A sacred pilgrimage ended up in the toilet for several travelers earlier this year. Health officials in Europe have reported an outbreak of superbug cholera traced back to tainted holy water sourced fromÂ Ethiopia. Health officials in Germany and the UK detailed the strange outbreak in a reportpublishedThursday in the journal Eurosurveillance. At least seven people across both countries were sickened with a multidrug-resistant cholera strain that originated from the Bermel Georgis holy well in Ethiopia. Though several people were hospitalized and some even required intensive care, all of the victims thankfully survived. Cholerais caused by the bacteriaVibrio cholerae. Though many people infected by cholera bacteria don’t become sick, the infection can sometimes cause severe, even life-threatening diarrhea and vomiting. Improved sanitation has greatly reduced the threat of cholera over time, but it still sickens millions of people a year, and anywhere between 21,000 and 143,000 people die from it annually, according to theWorld Health Organization. In recent years, there has been anupswing of choleraacross the world, including in parts of Europe. While most cases in Europe are travel-associated (meaning the infection was caught in another country), there have been local outbreaks tied to food and water imported from cholera-stricken areas. In Ethiopia, an ongoing outbreak of cholera hassickenedat least 58,381 people and killed over 700 since August 2022. This past February, a resurgence of cholera struck the Amhara region in Northern Ethiopia, home to theBermel Georgis holy well. The wellâa popular travel site revered for its natural waters said to contain miraculous healing powersâwas soon found to becontaminated with cholera, raising the risk of further spread. According to the report authors, health officials in Germany first caught wind of the outbreak in late February. Three residents had developed cholera earlier that month, and all had been exposed to the waters of the Bermel Georgis. Two of the residents had brought home holy water stored in a plastic bottle during a trip to Bermel Georgis. When they arrived back home, the two travelers consumed the water and splashed it onto the face of the third person. Health officials in the UK confirmed four similar cases around that time. Three of the residents recently traveledÂ to the area and a fourth person reported drinking Bermel Georgis water brought home by the third person (a fifth person was also sick with cholera-like symptoms but recovered without being tested). The multidrug-resistant strains of cholera found in the UK patients bore a genetic close resemblance to strains previously found in Africa, further confirming the outbreak’s origin. Fortunately, the cholera found in these people was still susceptible to at least one frontline antibiotic (standard cholera treatment is providing people fluids, though antibiotics are also used for more serious cases). Six of the seven people were hospitalized, with two needing intensive care at one point, but all eventually recovered. Clusters of cholera extending into Europe from Ethiopia are unusual, according to the researchers, though holy water consumption has been identified as a possible risk factor for cholera in the African country. It’s likely that the water had to be heavily contaminated with bacteria for it to still be infectious after the long journey back to Europe. Despite the unusual nature of this outbreak, officials say there are practical steps that travelers can take to limit their risk of catching cholera. “Travelers eating food cultivated in areas where cholera is endemic should follow the âcook it, peel it, or forget itâ rule, ensure drinking water is bottled or boiled, and refrain from transporting food and/or water across borders,” they wrote. “In the case of holy water, purely external use would reduce gastrointestinal infection risks.” choleraoutbreaksWeird medicine Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

The Masters Tournament is near its end, and we’re patiently awaiting the fourth and final round tee. However, thousands of golf fans struggle to access the Masters live stream outside the United States. This isn’t strange. The majority of channels and streaming services that broadcast the tournament are region-locked to the USA. So, how to watch the Masters abroad? We’ll let you in on a little trick! The tournament is broadcast on several streaming services based in the United States. These include: All five platforms are based in the United States. Worse yet, they’re allowed to broadcast only within the US borders. The solution that many people opt for isgetting a US IP address with a VPN. In most cases, they use NordVPN. Watch the Masters Abroad With NordVPN This VPN offers risk-free access to the live stream, no matter the location. It offers 2,000+ in the USA, with unlimited bandwidth and fast speeds for Full HD streaming. By far the best feature is a30-day money-back guarantee.

    "title": "Neutrinos Have No Business Being This Freaking Small",
    "article_text": "Physicists have placed a new limit on how big the elusive neutrino can beâone of the universe’s smallest known particlesâa limit that makes other subatomic particles look as big as black holes by comparison. In a new resultpublishedthis week in Science, researchers have put a new upper limit on the mass of this itsy-bitsy particle: no more than 0.45 electron volts (eV). For context, thatâs less than one-millionth the mass of an electron, which clocks in at a comparatively gargantuan 511,000 eV. So, yeahâneutrinos areridiculouslylightweight. Trillions of neutrinos pass through your body every second, but they are so small and so weakly interacting that you don’t feel a thing. Neutrinos are the only known elementary particles whose mass remains unknown, though questions remain about how well those elementary particlescooperate with the Standard Model.Â  Determining the neutrino’s mass with precision could offer profound insights into the universe’s laws. Are neutrinos getting their mass from theHiggs boson, as other particles do? Or is there some entirely new mechanism at play? Enter the Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino Experiment, or KATRIN, a 75-foot-long (23-meter-long) blimp-shaped vacuum chamber. Scientists monitor the radioactive decay of tritium inside the vacuum chamber; as the tritium decays, it spits out electrons and antineutrinos. Researchers canât measure the antineutrinos directly (they ghost through matter like it’s nothing), but they can (and do) study the leftover electronâs energy to make inferences about the mass of the missing particles. After analyzing 259 days of data, the KATRIN team was able to cut their previous best estimate for the neutrino’s mass (0.8 eV) nearly in half. But theyâre not finished; by the time the full 1,000-day dataset is crunched, the team hopes to push that mass limit down to 0.3 eV, maybe even 0.2 eV. Neutrinos still have plenty of tricks up their subatomic sleeves. As physicist Susanne Mertens from the Max Planck Instituteputs it, the KATRIN Collaboration’s measurement could be a backdoor into new physicsâand possibly a better understanding of how the early universe evolved. In February, a different team detected themost energetic neutrino(also called “ghost particles” for their enigmatic nature) deep in the Mediterranean Sea, indicating that the particles may be emitted by interactions between matter and the cosmic microwave backgroundâthe oldest visible light in the universe. If the neutrino mass were moreâaround one electronvoltâKATRIN could have found its actual value. But with the particle being so freaking small, a new and improved detectorâKATRIN++âmay be required to measure its mass with precision. Few things in life are certain, but among the things we can reliably expect are death, taxes, and the neutrino being smaller than ever. neutrinosParticle physicsparticles Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

A report published late last month outlines MATHUSLA, a particle detector named for the longest-lived person in the Bible. CERN says its Future Circular Collider has no technical hurdlesâthough the expected costs are exorbitant. Brookhaven National Laboratory's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider kicked off its final year of operations this week, marking a quarter century of discoveries in particle physics. The staggeringly energetic neutrino likely came from beyond our galaxy, and physicists have two main suspects.

    "article_text": "This article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. On Saturday, the Trump administrationrolled out a big exception to its across-the-board tariffs on electronics, such as computers and smartphones. The move spares Apple from major price hikes on a wide majority of its products and is a little relief for consumers and tech companies. In response, Amazon saw its chance to lower prices on the newly released 11th-generation iPad, which was released just a month ago in March. At$328 down from $349for the 128GB Wi-Fi model, this is the best deals youâll find on Appleâs latest tablet (it costs almost the same as the previous iPad10 which is available for $319) which makes it a must-buy if you’re looking for premium tech at a reasonable price point. See at Amazon The 11th-generation iPad is a major leap for Apple’s tablet line. It provides instant performance with the latest A16 chip and it is capable of handling everything from gaming to multitasking effortlessly. This chip was previously reserved for Apple’s high-end line and ensures the iPad performs effortlessly regardless of the app. From photo editing, video streaming, or multiple apps open simultaneously, the A16 chip provides unparalleled speed and efficiency. It is so much better than the A14 chip from the previous iPad 10. The 11-inch Liquid Retina display of the iPad is another highlight, and this is why people also love Apple tactile tablets. With colors that pop and razor-sharp definition, it’s ideal for watching movies, surfing the web or editing creative work. Basically, it can replace a laptop. The screen also features True Tone technology which changes the color temperature of the screen to match your environment for a more enjoyable viewing experience. Storage is not an issue with this discounted model either as it has 128GB of internal storage (256GB and 512GB models are not on sale) and provides more than enough space for apps, photos, videos, and documents. For most users, the capacity of this much is well balanced between cost and usability. Additionally, the iPad is Wi-Fi 6 compatible for faster and more reliable internet access. One of the most useful aspects of the new iPad is its all-day battery.Apple is guaranteeing as much as 10 hours of use on a single charge, which is ideal for long days at the office or on the road. The device also supports fast charging via USB-C so you can quickly top off your battery when you need to. It also supports accessories such as the Apple Pencil (2nd generation) and Magic Keyboard, turning it into an effective note-taking or productivity tool. At a mere $319 (reduced from its initial price of $349), this is an 8% discount on one of Apple’s new releases. The savings do not appear significant in contrast with the discounts applicable to earlier models or refurbished products, but this is a very new product being offered at this price levelso shortly after release. Amazon’s bold pricing approach ensures that this is an unbeatable deal, despite the tariffs hike. See at Amazon Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "article_text": "Astronomers using NASAâs James Webb Space Telescope just gave a cosmic mystery a serious plot twist. The event in questionâa sudden brightening from a star about 12,000 light-years awayâwas initially chalked up to the star swelling into a red giant and engulfing a nearby planet, a typical tale in some star systems. But not this time. Webbâs perceptive infrared gaze, courtesy of its MIRI and NIRSpec instruments, peered deep into the dusty aftermath with its Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) and Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) and found otherwise. The star, ZTF SLRN-2020, wasnât puffing up like a balloonâit appeared calm. Which means the planet didnât get accidentally gobbled up in explosive stellar behavior. Instead, the distant world was doomed by a slow orbital death spiral. The new research,publishedtoday in The Astrophysical Journal, revealed that the unfortunate, roughly-Jupiter-sized planet was orbiting way too close for comfortâcloser to its host star than Mercury is to our Sun. Over millions of years, that orbit shrank until the planet skimmed the starâs atmosphere. The planet’s material began to “smear around the star,” according to study co-author Morgan MacLeod, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and MIT, in a Webb Space Telescoperelease. The planet’s story then ended with a fiery faceplant into the star. âBecause this is such a novel event, we didnât quite know what to expect when we decided to point this telescope in its direction,â said Ryan Lau, lead author of the paper and an astronomer at the National Science Foundation’s NOIRLab, in the same release. “With its high-resolution look in the infrared, we are learning valuable insights about the final fates of planetary systems, possibly including our own.â When the planet’s material smeared onto ZTF SLRN-2020 it likely caused the dramatic brightening that caught astronomers’ attention. In fact, it’s revising astronomers’ account of the first star seen actively swallowing a planet. The gnarly observation was part of one of Webbâs Target of Opportunity programsâreserved for sudden cosmic weirdness, like supernovas or, apparently, planetary doom spirals. With next-gen telescopes like the Vera Rubin Observatory and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope gearing up, weâre likely to catch a lot more of these macabre stories of planetary ends. exoplanetsstarsThe Milky Waywebb space telescope Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

New Webb Telescope data confirms that asteroid 2024 YR4 poses no threat to Earth during its 2032 flyby. As for the Moon, not so much. Captured by Webb, it's the first direct evidence of auroras on the most distant planet from the Sun. The Webb Space Telescope captured a chance alignment of a protostellar outflow and a spiral galaxy in a dazzling example of the cosmos' weirdness. Astronomers using the Webb Space Telescope spotted the giganticâand growingâprimordial galaxy. A system 130 light-years away contains a gas integral to life processes on Earth.

    "article_text": "This article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. Not everyone wants to spend $500 on an Apple Watch, especially if the primary use is tracking and improving sporting performance. For those for whom fitness data takes precedence over high-end brands, Garmin is the global market leader in sport-focused smartwatches. TheGarmin Vivoactive 5, available today on Amazonfor as low as $199âwhich is a 33% discount from its original price of $299âis a classic case of how Garmin bundles high-performance capabilities at a very reasonable price. The Garmin smartwatch is made for sports enthusiasts, amateur athletes and anyone looking for a reliable partner for health. See at Amazon The Vivoactive 5 is equipped withstunning 1.2-inch AMOLED screen that has 390 x 390 pixels of resolutionand exhibits rich colors as well as crystal-clear images. The screen has significantly improved over its predecessor (the Vivoactive 4) and it will be a lot easier to read data even in direct sun or during severe exercise. Despite its premium display, the watch boasts agreat battery life of up to 11 dayswhen in smartwatch mode so you won’t be left having to be perpetually plugged into a charger. Even with heavy GPS use and activity tracking, you can expect eight days of useâa major improvement over many in this category. Garmin has packed the Vivoactive 5 full of a full suite of health and fitness tracking features: It includes aheart rate monitor, pulse oximeter for blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), sleep tracking with personalized coaching, stress monitoring, respiration tracking, and even menstrual cycle tracking.The Body Battery energy monitoring feature is particularly useful and provides insights into your energy levels based on factors like sleep quality, stress, and activity levels. For sportspeople, the watch comes with over30 preloaded activity profiles ranging from running and cycling to yoga and strength training. It even includes such niche ones as apps for active wheelchair use. While it lacks some of the high-end functions of Garmin’s flagship watches (which easily cost $800 or more), it still gives all the metrics required for most exercises. The GPS technology is GLONASS and Galileo satellite network compatible for accurate tracking during outdoor activities like running or cycling. If you like music, you will appreciate the ease ofdownloading music directly onto the watchfrom providers like Spotify, Amazon Music, or Deezer. This means you won’t have to carry your phone around for exercise but still enjoy listening to your favorite playlists. What’s more, Garmin Pay enables you to pay contactless directly from your wristâa convenient feature when making spontaneous buys on the fly. The Vivoactive 5 is also designed to work seamlessly with your smartphone: It includesnotification support for both iOS and AndroidÂ but only Android has direct replying on the watch. It is simple to install: simply pair the watch with Garmin Connect app via Bluetooth and follow the instructions to customize your experience. Features like LiveTrack, which allow you to share your live location with family or friends during activities, give an extra sense of security. This smartwatch is ideal for health enthusiasts who value long battery life, detailed health information, and robust activity tracking features over smartwatch frills like speakers or voice assistants. Certainly, it doesn’t have the bells and whistles of more expensive models like Apple Watch Ultra or Garmin Venu/Fenix, but it’s a huge value for its price.

    "article_text": "This article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. Govee may be the most recognized and high-end brand out there in the smart lighting market, but it’s not the only option.

Forsale now on Amazon for just $19âa full 60% off its normal price of $49âTorchlet’s Corner Floor Lamp is cheap and it has become the#1 best-seller in its category.

    "article_text": "One of those cuts that totally makes sense, but is still interesting to learn about. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. LongtimeFromSoftwaredataminerZullie the Witchhas uploaded a new video that interrogates one of the studio's most memorably strange non sequiturs:The giant guy made of ropewho carries you from the kingdom of Ashina to the celestial Fountainhead Palace. It seems like there was once much more to Mr. Rope-a-Dope than we saw in the final game. Much like the giant crow who takes us to Lordran in Dark Souls 1, or the multiple convenient transportation gargoyles in DS1 and 3, the giant rope guy in Sekiro always felt like a bit of a \"well, fuck it\" area transition. Thankfully, the absurd and nonsensical works just fine with FromSoft's surreal, disconnected house style. I did learn through Zullie's video that rope man was likely based on the real-life JapaneseWara ningyōdolls, just at a massive scale. Looking into the creature's associated files in Sekiro, Zullie uncovered unused AI scripts for the giant Wara ningyō which imply that it was once supposed to have active gameplay associated with it, rather than the single cutscene it has in the final game. That, of course, begs the question of how such a massive creature would have even worked with Sekiro's gameplay. Zullie measured the rope man as standing 191 meters tall⁠—that's more than twice the size of the Statue of Liberty, and almost halfway to the height of the Sears Tower in Chicago. One possibility pointed out by Zullie is that you didn't fight the rope man directly, but instead did battle with normal-sized enemies while climbing the thing. This is supported by Sekiro concept art of the rope man that shows various enemies hitching a ride. That would have presented its own issues, though. Sekiro's jumping and free movement doesn't seem like a great fit for such a constrained play space, particularly if it was moving, as the AI scripts imply. Ultimately, I'm pretty happy with what we got: The sort of utterly surreal, unexplained oddity that FromSoft is so good at creating.

The \"Calm Before the Storm\" update brings a slew of new features to support your frightening submarine expeditions on Europa, including a new mission, alien ruins, a ruin-themed outpost for PVP, additional modules for abandoned outposts, updated level backgrounds, and the ability to set up a \"reserve bench\" for bots. The devs summed up the new additionsin a press releaseon Thursday: \"Whether you're brave enough to explore alien ruins, reckless enough to throw hands in PvP, or just looking to yell at bots in new and exciting ways, Calm Before the Storm delivers another batch of improvements, reworks, and lovingly implemented chaos. All carefully tuned to ensure one thing: you’re never truly safe beneath Europa’s ice.\" In addition to those new features, Calm Before the Storm also includes some fixes and quality of life updates like improved AI for bots and improved balancing for the radiation mechanic that may have been a bit too punishing before. Although, now there are creatures thatbenefitfrom radiation exposure, so don't let yourself feel too safe.

They've alsocreated custom submarinesyou can access through the Barotrauma Workshop on Steam.

    "title": "Fallout and Skyrim show us that talented developers make great games when you leave them alone",
    "article_text": "Attention is the creativity-killer. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Would you pay $12,000 to escape notice for just three minutes? In GTA Online, perhaps you would. Say you've spent all weekend raiding drug dens, busting open crates at the docks and dancing for the pleasure of oligarchs in order to build a big pile of restricted goods. You've found a buyer, and now is the moment you set off in your plucky cargo plane to make the sale. The potential profits are huge—the equivalent of pulling off a well-choreographed heist. But so are the potential losses. Rockstar, like a trickster god, has put out a global alert to the entire map—tempting every idle player in the city to swing by in a Harrier jump jet, park up in the sky, and blow your hard-won cargo to bits with rockets. Suddenly, $12k for 180 seconds of amnesty from the public glare of the minimap sounds like a bargain. Sometimes, avoiding the attention of those with more power is the most valuable thing in the world. The same principle has been true for game developers, for as long as there have been videogames. Take the making of the original Fallout, which occurred at Interplay in the '90s under the watchful eye of absolutely no-one. \"The one thing I would say about Interplay in those days, and this isn't trying to pull the veil back or anything like that—there was just shit going on,\" Feargus Urquhart told meseveral years ago. \"It was barely controlled chaos. I'm not saying that Brian [Fargo] didn't have some plan, but there was just… stuff.\" It's easy to imagine, with a PC gamer's rose-tinted memory of Black Isle, that Interplay back then was a haven for novel RPG ideas. In reality, the publisher was far more excited about the potential of the D&D license than some retrofuturistic '50s fever dream in which there were no clear heroes. When I asked Tim Cain how Fallout survived the pitching process, he quipped: \"What do you mean, pitch?\" His team was left mostly unbothered by management throughout development, as Interplay focused on sports games and an online division now forgotten by history, named Engage. Fallout's budget was relatively tiny, and so didn't prompt any questions from accountants. \"It was almost like a smokescreen,\" Urquhart said. \"So much money was being pumped into these things that you could go play with your toys and no-one would know.\" Interplay's jockier mainstream hopes were ultimately irrelevant—while the oddball RPG in the corner became a flagship franchise for the whole industry, winning over millions of players and birthing one of the most-watched shows on TV. An institutional lack of interest wound up becoming the key to Fallout's initial success. It was the edge that allowed Cain's team to run with a truly new idea—one capable of standing out in the crowded field of post-apocalyptic fiction for decades to come. Of course, it's possible for a publisher to consciously let the artists cook, rather than doing it by accident. Jeff Gardiner, the project lead behind both Fallout 76 andWyrdsong, says that this was the beauty of Bethesda at its peak. Its parent company, Zenimax, simply didn't get involved in the day-to-day. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"As long as we earned the trust of them, they left us alone,\" he says. \"Which is so important as a creative. We were all designers, and we would understand the importance of our own internal milestones and goals. But if we missed them, it wasn't these alarm bells from people who didn't understand what was going on. We were able to self-correct.\" That judicious lack of oversight permeated everything in Bethesda's RPGs, in a positive fashion. \"If you ever play a game that you absolutely love, I guarantee you, the people making it loved it too,\" Gardiner says. \"I don't think it's possible to make a [great] game where people either don't like the working environments or feel like cogs in a machine. Because it requires a passion and energy that doesn't come from that.\" Bethesda's self-governance resulted in charming Skyrim absurdities likeants who cast shadows, and a headless horseman who could only be spotted when the moon was at its height. \"That's the kind of stuff that somebody who's keeping track of a schedule goes, 'Well, is that really a good use of time? No one's ever going to see this.'\" Gardiner says. \"There's a million reasons not to do that, but that's the fun of it. You just do it, and then ask for forgiveness rather than permission.\" It's these many minor bespoke elements - and the larger collage of pleasant surprises they contribute to—that PC gamers associate with Bethesda at their best. \"There are certain open-world games, not by Bethesda, that I call the checklist games,\" Gardiner says. \"Subconsciously, the people who get their checklist of tasks make the game about a checklist of tasks.\" The principle of flying under the radar scales higher than you might imagine. The larger the operation you're a part of, the bigger you can be without drawing the kind of attention which causes trouble. Think about Xbox, which for a long time was able to acquire a number of arty game studios and give them years to work away on their respective projects. Double Fine, inXile, Ninja Theory, Obsidian—all critical darlings who didn't show immediate signs of producing the industry's next monster hit. It was only after Xbox set its tractor beam onActivision-Blizzard that things appeared to change. The sound of its wrenching was heard across continents, and drew Microsoft into negotiations with antitrust regulators in a long and complicated deal approval process. It also made Xbox a much bigger part of Microsoft's business—attracting the great eye of Redmond. Since then, we've seen the closures of beloved Xbox-owned outfits like Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks (the latter belatedly resurrected by Krafton, but only after half of its staff had already found jobs elsewhere). The extra attention from Microsoft HQ doesn't seem to have done Xbox studios much good at all. \"With Activision under its wing, Microsoft is no longer the company of Game Pass, focused squarely on stuffing an industry-leading subscription service with a steady flow of must-play games,\" wrote former Edge editor Nathan Brown in his newsletter,Hit Points. \"It is now the company of Call Of Duty on PlayStation, of World of Warcraft on PC, of Candy Crush on phones and Minecraft on everything.\" Let us hope that the shadows cast by the likes of COD and Candy Crush are large enough to conceal a bold project or three. Because that is where Microsoft is most likely to get its next Fallout: in the dark corners that escape its scrutiny.

Frost Giant has announced thatStormgate's getting a fully-revamped campaign for its 1.0 release. The overhaul will touch every aspect of the campaign, from characters and voices to mission structure and how you manage your army. \"For 1.0, we have re-written the entire narrative structure of the campaign, are recording all-new dialogue, have scripted a completely different mission structure, and created a new 'mothership' hub area for players to explore between missions,\" it said in a press release.

Heroes will level, and have a choice of progression options, the item system will be overhauled, and there'll be permanent upgrades for your army between levels. The new campaign will be a total length of 14 missions, five \"radically overhauled\" missions from the current early access campaign and nine entirely new missions. It'll also roll out a new save/load system for the campaign missions. The announcement was accompanied by a minute-long trailer showcasing new missions, mechanics, and scenarios. The trailer has lots of combat with the human heroes and a few moments of inter-character chatter on the new hub area—something Frost Giant also says the campaign is getting a new system for.

    "article_text": "Microsoft's recalled Recall feature is un-recalled once again. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Microsoft's controversial AI screenshotting tool, Recall,is back againafter being, well,recallednumerous times. Nearly a year after its divisive announcement, Microsoft is finally rolling out Recall on Windows 11, but it's still not available for most users (and you probably shouldn't use it even if you do have access). Recall uses AI to \"remember\" things you've done on your Windows 11 PC by taking screenshots every few seconds in case you ever need help remembering something. A preview version of the feature is nowset for a \"gradual rollout\"to members of the Windows Insider program, meaning Recall is still not available to the general public. That's probably for the best. This isn't the first time Microsoft has attempted to launch Recall, but it keeps having to reel back the feature due to a slew of privacy issues and backlash from users. For instance, researchers spotted an earlier version of Recallstoring sensitive data as unsecured plain text files. Recall was also caughtscreenshotting credit card numbersand social security numbers. Microsoftmade some major changesback in September to address many of the initial issues with Recall, and changed it to an opt-in feature, meaning it would no longer be turned on by default. Microsoft requires users to set up Windows Hello to authenticate any attempt to access Recall data, and the sensitive data also thankfully isn't saved as plain text files anymore. So, for what it's worth, Recall is currently safer overall than it was when Microsoft originally announced it. You should still be careful about using it, though, assuming you're a \"lucky\" Windows Insider member who has access to it. While Microsoft has made it harder for hackers to access and steal your Recall data, you're still trusting Microsoft itself to protect huge amounts of data about yourself and the way you use your computer. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Depending on how comfortable you are with that, turning Recall on may seem fairly low-risk. Microsoft has said that itcan't access or view your Recall data, which its Copilot AI processes locally on your device (meaning that data isn't sent to the cloud). You can also freely pause or deactivate Recall, delete your screenshots, or filter out certain content and apps. I'm still not in any hurry to activate it on my Windows laptop. Considering Recall's turbulent history, I'd rather wait and see how the preview version turns out since more security issues could still pop up. While you risk your privacy any time you go on the internet, Recall takes privacy risks to a whole new level by literally watching everything on your screen. Some have even gone so far as tocall Recall \"spyware\"and compare it to a virus. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Stevie Bonifield is a freelance tech journalist specializing in mobile tech, gaming gear, and accessories.

    "article_text": "Echo Point Nova is a great game worth checking out. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Open-world, co-op, hoverboard FPSEcho Point Novahas just received asurprise free updatethat adds two new weapons to the game, rebalances an existing one, and expands the shooter's stunning world of floating islands. Last October, PC Gamer staff writer Morgan Park declared Echo Point Nova \"the best FPS of 2024 so far,\" with the overall crown snatched away a month later bySTRAFTAT, the superb (and free) 1v1 arena shooter throwback. Echo Point Nova is still one of 2024's finest, though, and even with all the indie FPSes vying for our attention these days, Echo Point Nova really sets itself apart. Movement is very much back in vogue with the FPS, but Echo Point Nova goes the extra mile, equipping players with a rad hoverboard that opens up ludicrous top speeds⁠—this gameplay video fromScout Trooperon YouTuber is almost more persuasive than the official trailer. For me, it calls to mind Source Engine surf maps or the eternal movement shooter guy fixation,Tribes, but it's in the context of a one to four-player FPS campaign, rather than freeform PvP. Contributor Dominic Tarason likened it to \"diving through someone's dreams after they played far too much Titanfall, Tribes, and Minecraft adventure maps.\" Echo Point Nova's latest update adds your classic sawn-off double-barreled shotgun, as well as a new bolt-action sniper. The game's previous scoped rifle has been tweaked to turn it into more of a DMR-battle rifle type-deal. The weapons can be found in two new islands added to Echo Point Nova's floating world. One centers a sort of squat pyramid, while the other consists of an imposing fortress over a lava lake. Echo Point Nova is the exact sort of game that makes me so excited to be an FPS fan right now. Things are pretty fallow in the triple-A space⁠—with the notable exceptions of id and MachineGames⁠—but the indie and double-A scenes are thriving.

    "article_text": "The cheeks update spares no man. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Marvel Rivals devs must know their audience because the latest patch features an asset update that has fans cheering—for cake. When season 2 of Marvel Rivals kicked off last week, players noticed some of the game's character assets looked a little morefleshed out, specifically the male characters' butts. While it might not outshineEmma Frost's famous thighs, the \"butt patch\" has finally delivered on fans' demands for cheek equality for the male characters. As you might expect, the devs didn't mention \"improved butt quality\" in the patch notes, but fans like user Weak-Bodybuilder-419 on the Rivals subreddit haveposted plenty of before-and-after photosto highlight the update. The response is overwhelmingly positive, with some players who joked about the male characters' butts surprised to find the devs listening, like user aklimilkacommenting: \"I said they need to tweak everyone's ass, the ones that are too big look like they got bad bbl jobs and the rest look way too flat. I really didn't expect it to be taken seriously but here we are.\" Other players are getting a laugh out of the fact that the devs clearly put a lot of time and attention into caking up the male characters, like one fan, sickfalco,who commented, \"What gets me is it’s so subtle. Like a dude was really messing with these cheek sizes, trying to get it fucking perfect. What a fine craftsman.\" Not all fans were satisfied by this marginal cheek enhancement, though. In fact, some seemed downright concerned about source material and anatomical accuracy, calling for evenmoreof a booty lift: \"These characters have cake in the comics. So I wonder if it's just a censure thing or something,\"said user ProblematicBoyfriend. \"Because the lack of dumpies and lumpies has nothing to do with the source material.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Reddit user jemidiah, an apparent subject matter expert, alsocommented, \"As a connoisseur of men's butts, particularly the muscular kind, I agree, these are still on the small side for these body types. But some of the 'before' pics are just sad, so it's an improvement.\" At least none of the male characters appear to have been left out of the \"butt patch.\" Now fans are looking ahead to the summer update for Marvel Rivals, where they'll be clamoring for some spicy summer season character skins (and, maybeeven biggerwagons).

    "title": "The Epic Store's latest free games giveaway includes 'over $100' worth of stuff for the Forgotten Realms idle game",
    "article_text": "Also includes River City Girls and in-game currency for Arcadeogeddon. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Epic's weekly game giveaways are now as familiar a part of the PC gaming landscape as eye-wateringly expensive graphics cards and Half-Life 3 conspiracy theories. But this week's offering is a little bit different. For starters, there are three games to download and keep for free this week, rather than the traditional two. The first isArcadegeddon, a cooperative rogue-like shooter developed by IllFonic and released in 2023. This is already available for free anyway, but you get $20 worth of the in-game currency 'Arccoins' with this download. The other isRiver City Girls, the well-liked side-scrolling beat 'em up originally launched in 2019. The main event, though isIdle Champions of the Forgotten Realms, a clicker take on Dungeons and Dragons where parties of DnD characters fight enemies and extract hoards of gold from their corpses, while you mainly unlock new characters and faff about with their formations. Jodyran a few questswith it back in 2017, noting that \"Idle Champions is a game designed to play itself. It even carries on in your absence when you shut it down, welcoming you back with a pile of gold the heroes earned while you were away.\" But Idle Champions appears to have grown quite a bit since then. Recently, it added the central party of Baldur's Gate 3, letting you click away the hours with Astarion, Shadowheart, Karlach etc. Like Arcadegeddon, Idle Champions is a free-to-play game, so the Epic giveaway similarly gives you a bunch of extra stuff gratis. Considerably more extra stuff, in fact. Alongside the Lobita the Guardian Familiar pack, which adds a friendly canine companion to your party, the giveaway also furnishes you with a total of 9,760 Platinum, the game's premium in-game currency. Combined, these extras are apparently worth over $100, and that doesn't include the value of River City Girls or Arcadegeddon's $20 in Arccoins. In short, it's a hefty chunk of free stuff. It may seem like an awful lot to give away, but Epic's free games programme has been apparently working wonders for getting users to spend money on the platform elsewhere. Epic's Tim Sweeney explained this himself in a callwith presslast year, stating \"you might think that this would hurt the sales prospects of games on the Epic Game Store, but developers who give away free games actually see an upsurge in the sale of their paid games on the store, just because their free game raises awareness.\" On the subject of raising awareness, I'm going to finish by highlighting that next week's free games include Botanicula, Amanita Design's hilarious microorganism adventure game from 2012, and possibly my favourite point and click ever.

    "article_text": "Five new factions, three new campaigns, and camels wearing trebuchets all coming in the expansion. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Age of Empires 2simply cannot be stopped. 26 years on from the game's original launch, and six years since the release of its almighty Definitive Edition, real-time strategy's most benevolent tyrant is still getting the kind of support that would put most live-service games to shame. Only last month, developer Forgotten Empiresunleashed a patch so colossalit has already entered the annals of the series' history. Now, the studio's gearing up to release another massive slice of DLC in just over three weeks' time. As you can probably glean from its subtitle, Age of Empires II Definitive Edition: The Three Kingdoms transports players back to ancient China in the dying days of the Han dynasty. The DLC introduces five new factions, three of which are the Shu, Wei, and Wu kingdoms the era takes its name from. Each of these factions gets several unique units, such as the Shu's war chariot, the Wei's tiger cavalry, which levels up as it kills enemy units, and the Wu's fire archer. The two remaining factions are the Jurchens, who can recruit bomb-throwing Grenadiers, and the Khitans. This last faction, which rallies around the Liao dynasty, gets access to one of the weirdest units in the DLC—the mounted trebuchet. This is a siege weapon that is apparently \"carried around by camels\". As everybody knows, anything can be instantly improved by putting it on a camel. These faction-exclusive units aren't the only new wee fellas you'll get to order around in the The Three Kingdoms. The DLC also introduces traction trebuchets, \"literal floating fortresses\" called Lou Chuans, spear-wielding fire-lancers, rocket carts (which replace mangonels) and dragon ships. You'll get to experiment with these new units in three new campaigns that focus on the Shu, Wei, and Wu clans respectively. These campaigns will guide players through the most notable events of the Three Kingdoms era, including the Yellow Turban Rebellion and the Battle of Red Cliffs. Naturally, you'll also meet some of the period's key characters, like Zhuge Liang and a certain Lü Bu. On top of all that, the campaign also apparently features an \"interactive system\" that players will use to \"make key decisions that shape each campaign\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. You can read the full detailshere. While I'll reserve proper judgement until the DLC is out, on paper at least it sounds rad. Forgotten Empires are no strangers to making excellent expansions to AoE 2 at this point, but this seems even more ambitious and comprehensive than usual. We don't have long to wait until we find out how well all these additions and ideas work out in practice.

    "title": "Former Skyrim dev announces a vehicular free-running game where you launch a car through a claymation world using mouth-sound explosions, and that's the weirdest thing I've ever had to fit into a headline",
    "article_text": "Deedlee Doo! Carkour! barrel-rolls onto Steam in May. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I had not realised that carkour—the theoretical act of performing parkour with a car—was something I wanted to exist until approximately 40 minutes ago, and now it has somersaulted to the summit of my own hierarchy of needs. Stuff all that nonsense about esteem and self-actualisation. I want to do backflips in a hot-rod. You could argue that carkour tacitly exists in games like Rocket League and Trackmania already. But they did not give it a clever name, and that ultimately is all that matters. This is the little nugget of genius upon whichDeedlee Doo! Carkour—a newly announced game dedicated to vehicular free-running—hopes to build its fortune. Deedlee Doo! Carkour! is the latest harebrained scheme from ex-Bethesda designer Nate Purkeypile, a veteran of games like Skyrim, all the Bethesda Fallouts, and Starfield. Purkeypile left Bethesda in 2021 to form his own indie studio, recently releasing the \"heavy metal horror game\"The Axis Unseen. Deedlee Doo is a different beast from The Axis Unseen tonally, mechanically, and well, everything-ly, tasking players with navigating a dinosaur-shaped racecar through a surrealist obstacle course. The key mechanical hook here is that your jet-propelled car can backfire like a medium-sized bomb going off, and you can use the resulting explosion to propel your vehicle through the air. You can then fine-tune your airborne movement using said engine, enabling you to steer as you fly and drive along walls. It's a wonderfully silly concept, and remarkably, driving an exploding car is the least weird thing about it. Deedlee Doo's world is built entirely from scans of clay models sculpted in real life, while the game's audio is comprised entirely of mouth sounds. Also, as the game's Steam page notes \"If you screw up a jump, children laugh and make fun of you,\" which is how all failure states in games should work, frankly. Given the time passed since the Axis Unseen's Launch, this seems like a rapid-fire project. Yet as games like Content Warning have proved, making games quick and dirty can sometimes yield a massive hit. There isn't long to wait until Deedlee Doo launches either. It rocket jumps onto Steam on May 12, whereupon it will cost \"less than a cup of coffee.\" 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "John Romero's brutal megawad Sigil 2 has formally chainsawed its way into Bethesda's Doom + Doom 2 remaster",
    "article_text": "Doom's unofficial sixth episode is now considerably more official. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Bethesda and Nightdive Studios' remaster ofDoom + Doom 2was not just an excellent overhaul of the legendary FPS and its sequel, it brought together all of vanillaDoom'sadditional adventures under one cracked, pentagram-scrawled roof. Alongside the two base games, it included the master levels for Doom II, the two halves of Final Doom, and a new official campaign developed by MachineGames, the furiously challengingLegacy of Rust. Yet there was one notable omission from the remaster's library of canonical (and semi-canonical) adventures—Sigil 2. Designed by Doom cocreator and general FPS legend John Romero, Sigil 2 is Doom's sixth episode, comprised of nine new levels (two of them secret) which take place directly after the events of the first Doom. The originalSigil, Doom's fifth episode, was initially released in 2019 and included as part of Doom + Doom II's official expansion lineup on launch. Sigil 2, on the other hand, was available only as a featured mod, meaning you had to go rummaging through the mod menu to find it. But this has now changed. Earlier this week, Bethesda patched Doom + Doom 2 which fixed various minor bugs and mod compatibility issues. Mainly though it officially added Sigil 2 to the roster of mainline Doom releases, meaning it appears on the game selection screen alongside Doom, its sequel, and the game's other supplementary adventures. It isn't clear why Sigil 2 wasn't part of this lineup to start with, given Sigil 1's inclusion. But the most sensible explanation would be that there were some licensing hurdles Bethesda couldn't vault in time for Doom + Doom 2's launch. Sigil 2 released in December 2023, while Doom + Doom 2 landed in August last year. Nine months might seem like more than long enough to get a licensing issue like this sorted, but in the legal world it's the blink of an eye. In any case, this update would suggest that both Sigil episodes are now officially part of the Doom story, which is exactly as things should be. I'm a big fan of both of Romero's new episodes, which unlike Legacy of Rust, limit themselves to the original Doom's weapon and enemy lineup, and are primarily exercises in level design. Structurally they're similar affairs, but Sigil 2 has generally larger and more challenging maps. Indeed, one key difference as told to meby Romero himself, is that he designed Sigil 1 so he could complete every level on ultra violence difficulty from apistol startwithout saving, whereas he designed Sigil 2 so that this was impossible even for him. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Of course, Sigil 2 isn't the only Doom game getting formally added to the series' roster this year. There's just over a month to go beforeDoom: The Dark Ageslaunches, and it seems that id Software is taking some pretty bold swings with the prequel. Joshua recently got hands-on with the follow-up and came away mostly, if not entirely impressed. \"Doom: The Dark Ages was not what I expected, but it was still a great, ridiculous power fantasy in the few hours I got with it, trading in running-and-gunning for rocking-and-socking in a way that still makes perfect sense for the series,\" Wolens wrote in March. \"It wasn't perfect and I still have questions, but I came away from my hours with The Dark Ages a lot more eager to play the full thing when it releases on May 15 this year.\" 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Rick has been fascinated by PC gaming since he was seven years old, when he used to sneak into his dad's home office for covert sessions of Doom.

It is a tradition well-regarded that PC gaming's long-standing FPSDoombe ported to every new piece of hardware that could, even vaguely conceivably, run it. Last year, id Softwaresurprise-droppedan updated Doom and Doom 2 as a collection, one that runs on modern hardware and has been pretty well-received. To wit, Limited Run Games is going to make a physical release of Doom + Doom 2. When it goes on pre-order on April 18 it'll come in astandard case, aretro-style big box, or as one of 666 limited copies of acompletely absurd $666.66 Will It Run Edition. Naturally, the box of the Will It Run edition is itself a device that runs Doom. Is that completely insane? Yeah, that's completely insane. Oh, and it also includes a little handheld Cacodemon toy... that also runs Doom. And some trading cards and the soundtrack on cassette tape and whatever:the box plays Doom.What the hell. Doom is perhaps one of the only games that can justify this level of absurd, celebratory excess. After all, in the words of PC Gamer's staff:Doom is Eternal. It's one of the foundational FPS games, and its technology and design became foundational to a wide variety of games. Anyway, now seems as good a time as ever to revisit some things people have run Doom on. Like, for example,inside Doom itself. You can also run Doom in amotherboard BIOs, in yourNotepad app, on theteletext TV information service, ongut bacteria, on yourdystopian wifi-enabled toothbrush, on avery expensive international satellite, right on yourNintendo Alarmo, and most recentlydirectly inside a PDF file.

In mid-February, the pretty dang buggy PC port ofMarvel's Spider-Man 2got upgraded to Verified status on the Steam Deck. It was a few weeks afterits first major patch, which brought some badly-needed stability and UI fixes, as well as auto-save backups. Players were skeptical, to put it simply, because it just barely worked on the Steam Deck in the first place. You could hover around 30 fps, but you had to tweak it a lot, and it just wasn't very stable. Over a month later,as of the end of March, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 now finds itself de-verified. Which I'm sure has happened before, but I'm not sure if it has happened to a game this high profile and high production value. Either way, seems Valve now agrees with the user consensus: Spider-Man 2 is rated as \"Playable\" on the Steam Deck, and that it'll take some manual tweaks to your graphical settings to make it run decently. Either way, port developer Nixxes is still hard at work on patches to address the graphical and performance issues. The most recent update—Patch 8—just released this week. It includes such beautiful gems of patch note wording as \"improved performance in areas with trees.\" PC Gamer's review of Spider-Man 2rated a fairly dismal 57% back in February, with reviewer Robin Valentine summarizing it as \"A flawed port of a flawed sequel.\" \"What you have is about 10 hours of pretty fun action and impressive spectacle intercut with another 10 hours of limp character moments,\" he said. \"From a project this obviously big and expensive, it all feels disappointingly undercooked ...

It sounded more like what we call a ute in Australia and and New Zealand and the rest of the English-speaking world probably knows as a pickup truck. Was American Truck Simulator about to downscale? The answer is, kind of, yes. As SCS Software explained in ablog post, it's working on a new mode called road trip that will let players \"enjoy the vast landscapes of ATS not only from the cab of an 18-wheeler but also from behind the wheel of, say, a powerful pickup or even a sports car.\" It'll apparently be more than just an opportunity to see the existing maps from a viewpoint closer to the ground. \"We're also exploring fresh gameplay opportunities\", SCS Software wrote, \"ways to give players a reason to drive them. That might mean taking on new kinds of tasks and jobs, or simply enjoying the open road, discovering landmarks, and soaking in the scenery.\" If you're happy to see American Truck Simulator remain a game about pretending to be Optimus Prime in deep cover, the studio is keen to assure you this project won't delay the continued expansion of the core game, saying, \"this new direction won't slow down our development of core trucking content.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. You want a sassy pitch for an upcoming game? Heroes of Valor is, per publisher Iceberg Interactive's press release, \"the Battlefield Heroes you can actually play.\" Clearly, it kind of is: It wears its inspiration on its sleeve as a spiritual successor to the now decade-dead free-to-play shooter. It also has a (free) playtest running right now on Steam, where it's \"coming soon\" into early access. The third-person shooter takes place in a cartoonish World War 2 and—at current development—features four hero infantry classes with unique abilities, tanks, planes, and motorcycles. It has customizable battle rules, letting you tweak things like time of day, several game modes, and boasts of \"intelligent bots that flank, fly, and fight with real strategy.\" Developer Fancy Cat Interactive are making Heroes of Valor because they \"found themselves waiting endlessly for a successor after [Battlefield Heroes] was taken offline. When none came, they decided to build it themselves.\" You can findHeroes of Valor on Steam, where it's currently undergoing a playtest you can apply to join. There's not yet a release date for the early access version, but it intends to stay in early access for about a year. Battlefield Heroes isn't a game that I'd have expected there to be this kind of nostalgia for, but the Steam forums for Heroes of Valor are filling up with comments excited about the appeal. Kind of goes to show that even if it passed you by, any given free-to-play game was probably someone's mainstay, everyday game at some point. It's cool to see one of those crowds being catered to by enthusiastic developers. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "Help with solving Sunday's puzzle. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Take a look at today'sWordleclue if you'd like to give your puzzle solving a bit of direction without spoiling all of your fun. Bring it out early to get your game off to a great start, or save it for later when those yellow letters might feel more like a problem than part of the solution. The answer to the April 13 (1394) Wordle's here too, just in case you need it. The first green letter I revealed today didn't exactly fill me with joy. It was an awkward letter in an awkward spot, and working around it was… well, you know. It did however drastically reduce the number of words I could try, so after too much head-scratching and one wobbly attempt at winning I eventually found the answer. The sort of reaction you'd have after hearing a good joke, being tickled, or just generally being incredibly happy. No, there is not a double letter in today's puzzle. If you've decided to play Wordle but you're not sure where to start, I'll help set you on the path to your first winning streak. Make all your guesses count and become a Wordle winner with these quick tips: You're not racing against the clock so there's no reason to rush. In fact, it's not a bad idea to treat the game like a casual newspaper crossword and come back to it later if you're coming up blank. Sometimes stepping away for a while means you can come back with a fresh perspective. Let's win this. The answer to the April 13 (1394) Wordle isLAUGH. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Previous Wordle solutions can help to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer isn't likely to be repeated. They can also give you some solid ideas for starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. Here are some recent Wordle answers: There are six rows of five boxes presented to you by Wordle each day, and you'll need to work out which five-letter word is hiding among them to win the daily puzzle. Start with a strong wordlike ALIVE—or any other word with a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You should also avoid starting words with repeating letters, so you don't waste the chance to confirm or eliminate an extra letter. Once you've typed your guess and hit Enter, you'll see which letters you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the first, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you might have missed on the first row—just don't forget to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the correct word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words and don't forget letters can repeat too (eg: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the dailyWordlepuzzle to give readers a hint each and every day. Her Wordle streak is truly mighty.

    "article_text": "Katt also appeared in movies including Dazed and Confused and Boiler Room. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. As reported byAV Club, actor Nicky Katt has died at age 54 of an unspecified cause. While he's better-known to most for a portfolio full of character actor roles, often as a jerk or bully or outright villain in movies like Dazed and Confused, Strange Days, SubUrbia, Boiler Room, School of Rock, The Limey, and Way of the Gun, Katt will probably be known to readers of PC Gamer as Atton Rand in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2. Fresh off a role as schoolteacher Harry Senate in the first three seasons of Boston Public, Katt played a subversive take on Han Solo in Obsidian's RPG full of subversive takes on Star Wars. While Atton was a sarcastic smuggler and the pilot on your ship, he turned out to have a secret, dark past—as pretty much every character in a Knights of the Old Republic game is required to by galactic law. Katt made it work, able to portray both the haunted survivor and the snarky fast-talker—if you play a woman, one of his first lines quotes Anakin in Phantom Menace, before immediately undercutting it as a ridiculous thing to say. (It was 2004, making fun of the Star Wars prequels was in.) Though Atton was his only videogame role, Katt turned in the kind of star performance Hollywood never gave him a shot at, with a chance to reveal vulnerability behind the facade. Depending how you play it, he can become your best friend and leave you feeling like a kind of Jedi Giovanni Ribisi. Katt also played a street-racing thug named Spike in 1997's Batman & Robin and a SWAT driver in 2008's The Dark Knight—he's the guy who says, \"What is that, a bazooka?\" That means Katt was possibly the only actor to appear in both Joel Schumacher's camp Batman movies and Christopher Nolan's grim-and-gritty Batman trilogy.

    "title": "'Catastrophic overtraining' could harm large language AI models that are trained on more data for the sake of training",
    "article_text": "University researchers found less is sometimes more when it comes to LLMs When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Researchers from Carnegie Mellon, Stanford, Harvard, and Princeton are challenging one of AI development’s accepted core beliefs - that the more pre-training data the better the performance. As reported byHPCwire, a new paper discuses the concept of “catastrophic overtraining,” whereby extended pre-training can harm a model’s performance after fine-tuning. The researchers compared two versions of the OLMo-1B model, one trained on 2.3 trillion tokens and another on 3 trillion. Despite the larger training set, the more extensively trained model reportedly performed up to 3% worse on benchmarks like AlpacaEval and ARC. This performance drop, the study claims, is linked to a phenomenon called “progressive sensitivity.” As the token count increases, the model becomes more fragile. Even small tweaks, like adjustments during fine-tuning, or the introduction of noise, can reverse earlier gains. The authors demonstrated this by injecting Gaussian noise into pre-trained models, noting that performance degraded more sharply the longer the model was trained. The point where this additional training starts to degrade performance is called the “inflection point.” Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Once reached, the benefits of training start to become outweighed by the risk of internal instability. The study found that this tipping point often occurs beyond 2.5 trillion tokens in smaller models, like OLMo-1B. “Catastrophic overtraining may be inevitable... especially when the pre-training and fine-tuning tasks are misaligned,” the authors warn in their paper, which you can access through thearXiv pre-print server. While the researchers are not suggesting an end to pre-training, they do feel that developers should consider just how much pre-training is enough. As the paper concludes, “Our findings call for a renewed focus on model scaling that considers the entire training pipeline.” For AI developers chasing scale, the message seems clear: sometimes, less really is more.

    "title": "Microsoft is digging its own grave with Windows 11, and it has to stop",
    "article_text": "Progress for progress’s sake? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Look,Microsoft, we need to talk. It’s no secret that you’ve been nagging me (and everyone else) to upgrade toWindows 11for a while now, with everything from ads to in-OS reminders pushing me towards the settings menu to check if my PC is eligible for an upgrade. But here’s the thing, Microsoft: this path you’re on isn’t sustainable. I mean this in a few different ways. Firstly, the extremely literal sense;Windows 11forces a Trusted Platform Module 2.0 requirement, which for the uninitiated is a specific chip on your laptop or desktop’s motherboard enabling enhanced security features. No TPM 2.0? NoWindows 11. Yes, I know you can technicallyupgrade to Windows 11 without TPM 2.0, but I wouldn’t recommend it. Is that enhanced security good? Yes, absolutely - but it effectively means that many older computers literally can’t run Windows 11, which combined with theimpending Windows 10 End of Lifeis eventually going to result in alotof PCs headed to the ever-growing e-waste pile. That’s a real problem in itself. But I’m not here to rant about e-waste (thoughit’s really bad). I want to talk about how users perceive Microsoft’s nigh-omnipresentoperating system, and how its current trajectory could result in serious issues further down the line. See, Windows is constantly evolving - from humble beginnings as an MS-DOS interface in the mid-Eighties to beloved iterations like Windows XP and 10 (and widely panned versions, such as Vista and RT). But over the years, there have long been whispers ofa ‘final’ version of the OS; a ‘Windows Perfected’ if you will, designed to last forever with continual updates - or at least, designed to last for a very long time. In a sense, what those hunting for this ‘last’ Windows iteration want is the same experience that macOS users get: an operating system that just continually gets free updates adding new features, rarely changes in a hugely significant way, and isn’t chock-full of annoying ads. Of course, it’s not quite that simple for Microsoft;Applehas incredibly tight control over the macOS hardware ecosystem, while Microsoft theoretically has to make Windows run on a near-limitless selection of custom- and pre-built PCs as well as laptops from numerous different manufacturers. Then again, keeping ads out of Windows should be as simple as it is for macOS, and that hasn’t happened… At the end of the day, Microsoft doesn’tneedto keep creating entirely new versions of Windows - it does so because outside of an Apple-esque closed ecosystem, that’s profitable, as system manufacturers will need to keep buying new OS keys and users will need to keep buying new systems. Sure, there might need to be major overhauls now and then that leave some people behind - the TPM 2.0 debacle is perhaps one such example. But there are cracks in this methodology that are slowly starting to show, and I suspect it won’t end well unless Microsoft changes course. If upgrading to a new OS is a lot of hassle for an individual (I’ve personally been putting it off for years, still usingWindows 10on my personal desktop), imagine how much work - and how much money - it takes for a large business to do it. AlthoughWindows 11 adoption is finally on the rise, plenty of private businesses and public sector organizations are still stuck on Win10 or older, despite Microsoft’s insistence for us all to upgrade. A 2021report by Kasperskysuggested that 73% of healthcare providers globally are still using equipment with an outdated OS for medical purposes. Now, this isn’t just talking about Windows computers, but it’s a damning figure - a more recentinvestigation by Cynerioclaimed that 80% of imaging devices are still using operating systems that have been officially EoL’d and are now unsupported, like Windows 7 and XP. Healthcare is just one such sector, but it’s felt widely, particularly in sectors and countries where funding for hardware and software upgrades often isn’t readily available. Running an out-of-support OS can lead to a variety of issues, not least with security and compatibility. It’s not that these organizationsdon’t wantto upgrade, it’s that theyliterally can’t- not without the significant expenditure of completely replacing the computer, and sometimes the entire machine it’s hooked up to. Lastly - and I’m going to be a bit brutally honest with you here, Microsoft - the slow but inexorable enshittification of Windows has got to stop. Ads, bugs, pestering notifications, the constant forcing of Copilot AI down our throats; just stop it, guys. Please. I have Windows 11 on my laptop, and also the ROG Ally I used for handheld PC gaming. I’m no stranger to how bad it’s become.My dislike of Apple hardware is well-documented, yet macOS’s year-on-year consistency and total lack of ads is beginning to look mighty appealing. Win11 feels less like a product you buy and own and more like an ‘OS as a service’ - something you pay for but don’t really own, and can be snatched away or heavily modified at a moment’s notice. It’s already a serious issue in the game industry, with triple-A games increasingly becoming less about providing a good, fun experience and more about extracting as much value from the player as possible. Even Windows 10 isn’t safe from Microsoft’s meddling. At this point, I’m half looking forward to the EoL purely so that Microsoft will take its grubby little fingers out of my desktop OS. No, I don’t care abouthow great Windows 11 supposedly is now. No, I don’t care aboutCopilotand how it’s going to fix my digital life and cure all my worldly ailments. Let me create a little analogy here. Imagine if you bought a car. It’s a good car, it runs fine and doesn’t give you any major issues. Then, a few years later, a new model comes out, and every morning, no matter where you park, the dealership sends someone to put a flyer on your windshield advertising the new car, or some other new offer the dealership is running. Every now and then, they also take away a small part of your car, like a wiper blade or a single tire nut. The kicker? You don’t want the new car, and you might not even be able to afford it anyway. I just want a straightforward OS that runs smoothly and doesn’t become outdated every five years. Is that really too much to ask, Microsoft?

    "title": "‘The key is to build a bridge with iOS’: OnePlus has a plan to tackle Apple's smartphone industry dominance",
    "article_text": "Exclusive: ‘We don't want to build an ecosystem that shuts the door’ When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. For smartphone manufacturers, competing withApplemust feel like bringing a knife to a gunfight. Every. Single. Quarter. Thebest iPhonesaren’t necessarily thebest phonesoutright (read: they’re not), but the Cupertino giant has undoubtedly managed to cordon off a large swath of smartphone-owning consumers (perhaps indefinitely so) through its decades-long focus on building a watertight product ecosystem. Heck, evenSamsung, Apple’s biggest competitor, has seen its ownhome country fall victim to iPhone fever, and Apple remains a force to be reckoned with in China, too. What, then, are Apple’s rivals to do? According to OnePlus’ Senior Product Marketing Manager Rudolf Xu, there’s only one thing for it: push for greater compatibility with iOS. “I think the key thing is to build a bridge with iOS,” Xu told TechRadar during a recent visit to OnePlus HQ in Guangdong, China. “That’s why, for example, on OxygenOS 15, we have a feature called Share with iPhone, and people love it – we are getting very positive feedback, because it makes file transfer [between Android and iOS] a lot easier. That’s something that Android devices have always struggled with. “Another thing is the sharing of live photos,” Xu continued. “If you capture a live photo with theOnePlus 13, you can actually still see the live photo effect on an iPhone [if you transfer it]. That’s because we’re using the latest format to package live photos. “These are all the efforts we’re putting in to build a bridge between OnePlus products and the iOS ecosystem. We don't want to build an ecosystem that shuts the door for other customers. We want to make [our ecosystem] as open as possible, so that we can attract more users.” In person, Xu’s comment about “an ecosystem that shuts the door for other customers” wasn’t made in reference to Apple directly, but it does rather nicely highlight the crux of the issue at hand. Apple won’t willingly open up itsoperating systemto rival software developers (and why would it?), so there’s only so much that brands like OnePlus can do to improve compatibility between Android- and iOS-based devices. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. We want to make [our ecosystem] as open as possible, so that we can attract more users. Indeed, Apple would never make the process of connecting AirPods to one of thebest Android phonesas seamless as connecting AirPods to an iPhone, but OnePlus can at least ensure that its own smartphones aren’t totally incompatible with Apple handsets. Of course, compatibility does not equal homogeneity, and OnePlus has found other ways to differentiate thebest OnePlus phonesfrom iPhones (not to mention other Android phones) in recent years. We recently reported thatconsumers are growing tired of modern smartphone design, and while, in our interview, OnePlus’ Xu acknowledged that there is logic behind the industry’s current sameness, he affirmed his brand’s commitment to standing out from the crowd. “When it comes to design language, [there’s a reason] why more and more products look alike,” Xu explained. “Basically every [manufacturer] is putting a camera in the upper-left corner of the phone, and actually, from an R&D perspective, this has the highest efficiency for component stacking. By ‘component stacking’, I mean how a phone’s battery [is arranged in relation to] its chipset, and so on. “Most [manufacturers] like to put the battery [in the bottom half of the phone], the chipset [adjacent to the camera], and the camera [in the upper left corner]. In terms of R&D, this is the most effective and efficient way to stack the components. So, maybe that’s why we’re seeing more and more similarly designed phones. There is reasoning behind that. “But on the other hand,” Xu continued, “we also try to maintain our unique design language. That’s why there’s consistency across theOnePlus 10 Pro, the11, the12, and now the13. I mean, it is a challenge [to develop devices that are both unique and popular], but we want to maintain our unique identity across all OnePlus products.” As far as we’re concerned, this approach is working – in ourOnePlus 13 review, we described the company’s latest flagship as “one of the best-looking phones you can buy.” Now, OnePlus has the not-so-small task of putting such an impressive phone in the hands of Apple’s iPhone-owning faithful.

The answers to today's Connections, game #673, are… I crashed out today, after getting the yellow and green group. RESTRICT was easy enough, although I did hesitate over DAM, thinking that it could be in a water-based group with FORD, but I took the leap. I got the green group without thinking tickets was the common thread, just that they were all things people paid for. After this I was utterly clueless and tried random groupings with little logic. For my final guess I did almost make it, as I got “one away”, but it was too late. I should have realised that FORD was both an answer and a connector. In my defense,The Oregon Trailis not something that really crossed the Atlantic to the UK, although I do have vague recollections of “You have dysentry” T-shirts going viral a couple of decades ago – not that I understood why. How did you do today? Let me know in the comments below. NYT Connections is one of several increasingly popular word games made by the New York Times. It challenges you to find groups of four items that share something in common, and each group has a different difficulty level: green is easy, yellow a little harder, blue often quite tough and purple usually very difficult. On the plus side, you don't technically need to solve the final one, as you'll be able to answer that one by a process of elimination.

    "article_text": "More battery life, wireless charging? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We've not heard much so far about the successor to theGoogle Pixel Watch 3, but considering that wearable came out last September, a follow-up shouldn't be too far away – and newly leaked, unofficial renders may offer our first look at thePixel Watch4. These renders come from seasoned tipster@OnLeaksand91mobiles, and are apparently based on information sourced fromGoogle's supply chain. They show a smartwatch that doesn't vary too much from the current design in terms of its looks. There are some small changes to talk about though: the Google Pixel Watch 4 is said to be slightly thicker than its predecessor, possibly indicating a larger battery and longer battery. The display bezels are also reportedly going to be slightly smaller than they are on the Pixel Watch 3. The leak also mentions that wireless charging could be introduced for the Pixel Watch 4, something we haven't seen on Google's smartwatches so far – which would potentially mean it could be charged via a bigger range of third-party accessories. We've also got two tiny buttons either side of the speaker, on the left of the watch as you look at the screen. It's not clear what these buttons are for yet, but they're nowhere near as prominent as the digital crown on the other side. According to this new leak, the Pixel Watch 4 will be available in two sizes, as the Pixel Watch 3 was. Those sizes will \"possibly\" be 41 mm and 45 mm, matching the current model, but we'll have to wait and see on all these details. Leaks and rumors around the Google Pixel Watch 4 have been thin on the ground so far. Wehave heard murmuringsthat Google will aim to improve repairability on its next smartwatch, which would be welcome, but that's about all we've heard – though more details may emerge between now and September.

    "article_text": "However Google is still expected to spend significantly less than Microsoft and OpenAI When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It’s interesting times forNvidia-backed CoreWeave, which provides cloud infrastructure optimized for AI workloads. It was labelled a“turkey” and “the WeWork of AI”by Jeffrey Emanuel, whose prescient article warning about DeepSeek famously wiped $2 trillion off global markets and cut Nvidia’s market capitalization by $600 billion in day. Around the same time,Microsoftwalked away from a nearly $12 billion optionto purchase additional data center capacity from CoreWeave. That same capacity ultimately went to the Microsoft-backed OpenAI. President Donald Trump’s tariffs, which have been wreaking havoc on the stock market, particularly in the tech sector, have impacted the AI hyperscaler as well. The company lost nearly a quarter of its value within 48 hours. Still, it’s not all bad news, as a report fromThe InformationclaimsGoogleis in advanced talks with CoreWeave to rent Nvidia Blackwell chips from it after struggling to meet growing demand. Google CFO Anat Ashkenazi said during the company’s recent earnings call, “We exited the year with more demand than we had available capacity. So, we are in a tight supply-demand situation, working very hard to bring more capacity online. As I mentioned, we've increased investment in capex in 2024, continue to increase in 2025, and we'll bring more capacity throughout the year.\" There’s no word yet on how much Google might spend with CoreWeave, butThe Informationreports that the amount will be “significantly smaller” than the $10 billion Microsoft plans to spend by the end of the decade, orOpenAI’s new $12 billion five-year contract. Google and CoreWeave are also reportedly in “preliminary discussions” about leasing space in CoreWeave’s data centers to house Google’s custom TPU chips,The Informationadds. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! If true - Google and CoreWeave have not commented onThe Information’s story which cites “two people briefed about the situation” as its source - this would be a welcome boost for CoreWeave, which had to scale back its initial public offering and reportedly receives 77% of its revenue from just two customers, one of which is Microsoft.

    "title": "I love LG’s new Magic Remote design for its OLED TVs – too bad only certain regions are getting it",
    "article_text": "Mixing the old with the new When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It could be considered tremendously geeky to fuss over, or to even discuss, the remote control that comes with your TV. But a solid, well-designed remote is a key feature of thebest TVs, and if you spend several hours every day watching, it’s something you’re getting plenty of hands-on time with. As someone who reviews TVs and other AV gear regularly, remote controls are something I pay close professional attention to. When I reviewed theHisense U8NTV, I’m not ashamed to admit feeling a sense of delight when I held its solid, well-designed remote, which even featured a backlit keypad. It was a huge upgrade over the cheap, plasticky, and basic remote that came with theHisense U8Kthat preceded it, and it added more value to an already high-value TV. Conversely, I nearly shuddered when I saw the remote control that came with thePanasonicZ95A, the company’s 2024 flagshipOLEDTV, and one that marked the brand’s triumphant return to the US market. In myPanasonic Z95A review, I generously called it “disappointing given the Z95A’s otherwise premium build quality (and price!).” The Z95A’s remote was essentially the same one you’d get with any cheap Fire TV set you’d buy on Prime Day for a bargain price fromAmazon, which supplied the Fire TV smart TV interface for Panasonic’s new 2024 TVs. LG’s Magic Remote control is a long-standing feature of its TVs, including many of thebest OLED TVsover the past decade. The Magic Remote differs from other TV remotes in that it has both a scroll wheel and a pointer wand control that lets you hover a cursor over items in the TV’s webOS smart interface and click on them to make a selection. The Magic Remote operates like a wireless computer mouse, and I’m sure that was a deliberate design choice back in the days when companies like LG were first adding a web browser and other computer-like features to their TVs, thinking people were going to eagerly use them for web-surfing and work. The Home Office Quick Card in webOS 25 provides strong evidence that LG still thinks people want to use their TV as an oversized computer monitor for work, which is something I can’teversee myself doing. I’ve always found LG’s Magic Remote to be fine to work with, even if I’m not using it to actuallydo workon a TV. But it’s certainly a divisive design, even among longtime fans of LG OLED TVs. Fans such as TechRadar contributorDave Meikelham, who said this of the Magic Remote: “The aging peripheral now possesses about as much sorcery as a drunk magician unsuccessfully trying to pull a rabbit out of a hat at a crestfallen child’s birthday party.” Part of the resistance to LG’s Magic Remote is a feeling that the cursor function is inaccurate, with the arrow whizzing randomly around the screen when you attempt to select an item on the smart interface or in a menu (the cursor’s speed can be adjusted in the TV’s setup menu, a setting critics may not have bothered to mess with). But another big part is that LG hadn’t updated the basic design in years, and worse, the remote had a cheap build quality that seems out of step with a premium, pricey TV. When I recently reviewed theLG G5, the brand’s flagship 2025 OLED, I was very happy to see that it came with a redesigned Magic Remote. Finally! This new AI Magic Remote version abandons the old shoehorn-like design for a more modern flat form factor with gently rounded corners and a streamlined keypad with a limited button count. Yes, the scroll wheel is still there, and as with the previous version, clicking on it will trigger the cursor control to use that function. But the new design appears to favor the more conventional navigation disc control option, which works perfectly well on the speedy, responsive webOS 25 smart interface. The new design also adds a few buttons that previously weren’t found on Magic Remotes, specifically Accessibility, Home Hub, and AI shortcut buttons. That last one also facilitates voice commands, which is clearly something LG now wants us to be using on its TVs. What’s missing in the new-look AI Magic Remote are number buttons and, crucially, an input select control, which is something I griped about in my G5 review. Yes, you could use voice commands to create a shortcut for selecting a specific input on the TV (which supportsGoogleHome and LG’s own ThinQ smart home protocols), or you can, as I found myself doing, jump to the Home Hub and select an input from there. But I guess I’m old school that way:I want an input button on my TV remote control(and backlighting too, thanks). Now that I’ve pumped up LG’s AI Magic Remote (for the most part), I need to step back and share that the new design isn’t available in all regions – the UK, for instance. Certain regions have legal requirements that prevent TV manufacturers from removing buttons such as a numbered keypad from remote controls, and for those regions, LG is retaining the same old Magic Remote design. The good news here – if you see it that way – is that this design is a new-old hybrid AI Magic Remote that includes the AI and Home Hub buttons. The bad news? The input select button has been removed from this one as well. I wish it didn't have to be this way – there's been a history of companies such asSamsungincluding two remotes in the box to get around these rules – but for those of use who get the stylish new remote, I think it's a much-awaited step forward.

    "title": "I have Philips Hue lights everywhere in my home, and this is what I want to see from its AI assistant",
    "article_text": "Five bright ideas When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. At CES 2025 in Las Vegas, Signify (the company behindPhilips Hue) announced thatthe Hue ecosystem will soon have its own generative AI assistantto make lighting your home easier. Details are quite scant so far, but we know that it will be possible to control the tool using typed or spoken commands, and that it will create \"personalized lighting scenes based on mood, occasion, or style.\" You'll also be able to give feedback to help improve the assistant's output in the future. There's no word on exactly when the assistant will be released, but late last month, the editor of fan siteHueblog.comnoticed that the usual magnifying glass icon in the Hue app's search box had been replaced by the cluster of stars that typically represent AI features. The launch could happen at any time, but what exactly will it bring? Will it just focus on changing the colors of your lights, or will it change how you use your whole Philips Hue system? As someone with a complete set of Hue lights at home, I'm intrigued to see what's coming, and I've got a wish list of things I'd love to see when the assistant eventually lands. This might be too much to ask, considering the time and cost of developing and running AI tools. Even so, Philips Hue products are already among the most expensive smart lights on the market, and adding an extra subscription fee for AI features might put off some potential customers - even if those tools are optional. The backlash against the AI-powered Garmin Connect+subscription demonstrates how angry customers can become if new features are locked behind a paywall after paying for the hardware. I won't hold my breath. After all, the Philips Hue ecosystem already has various subscription options for those who want extra features, includingPhilips Hue Securefor security cameras and an optional monthly fee for thePhilips Hue Syncapp onLGandSamsungsmart TVs (as an alternative to a one-off payment). The fact that the default search icon changed to an 'AI' symbol without any payment being made gives me hope that it will be available free to everyone. However, a free AI assistant might be very limited in scope, so i'm a little torn about this. The Philips Hue ecosystem includes some of thebest smart lightsaround, and they can do a lot more than just create mood lighting. So, it would be great if the upcoming AI assistant could capitalize on that. For example, if you could tell the assistant \"I'm going away for a week\", it might enable a seven-day 'mimic presence' automation that switches lights on in different rooms throughout the day to create the impression that someone is home. A more sophisticated assistant might also be able to create a full morning routine that gradually wakes you by increasing the brightness of your lights and an evening routine that dims them (and changes the colors to sunset tones) after dark and turns off your smart plugs and switches, all without tinkering with settings manually. Signify says that the upcoming AI assistant will be able to control your lights, but it would be even better if it also worked with other Hue devices. After all, the ecosystem includes some of thebest smart switchesandbest home security cameras, so it makes sense to incorporate these. If the assistant worked with devices other than lights, you could also use it toarmand disarm your security devices. For example, telling it, \"I'm going to work,\" might arm your security system and turn off all lights until you're due home (or it senses that you're back). A few weeks ago, Ring announced a new feature for subscribers: the ability to search their video recordings for specific events using AI. TheSmart Video Searchfunction lets you find a specific moment using natural language. Just type your request into the app (such as 'show me when the package was delivered' or 'show me the deliver driver in the brown uniform'), and the tool will find and display that snippet of footage. If you already have a Philips Hue Secure subscription, something similar would be a great addition that would save you time scrubbing through footage to find out when something happened. Thefourth-generation Nest Learning Thermostatmonitors how you heat and cool your house and uses AI to suggest changes that you could make to reduce your energy consumption - so why not something similar for your lights and devices connected to Philips Hue smart plugs? Granted, lights use much less energy than an HVAC system, but it would still be nice if your bulbs, sensors, and cameras worked together to determine optimal times to turn off your lights to conserve a little power. It's even possible thatone day your Philips Hue light bulbs may be able to act as presence sensors, so you wouldn't even need any extra devices to determine whether you're in the room, or you've left and it's fine to switch off the lights.

    "title": "I upgraded my Mac mini M4 with a 4TB SSD and avoided paying Apple's ridiculous storage prices – here’s how",
    "article_text": "Do it yourself and save a fortune When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. TheAppleMac mini M4 is arguably the biggest bargain in computing. This (almost) pocket-sized mini Mac is fast, powerful, near-silent and costs around half the price of the cheapest equivalent MacBook Air. It's almost too good to be true. I bought one last month, my first new Mac since theMacBook Air M1in 2020, and it's given me that same sense of 'how did they do that?' wonder. We described it as \"the best small form factor PC\" in ourMac mini M4 review– and with good reason. I can't believe how quiet it is, how small it is, how swift it is at doing things that my now-slightly creaking M1 MacBook Air struggles with (such as opening more than 10 Chrome tabs at once). But if you're thinking of buying one – and you totally, definitely, absolutely should – I have one bit of advice for you: do not waste your money on Apple's own internal SSD upgrades. Seriously, don't even consider it. Because while the Mac mini is an undoubted bargain, Apple's storage is so overpriced that it's a joke. Instead, you'll want to buy an external enclosure and NVMe storage. That's exactly what I did, and it's saved me a fortune. The simple fact is that Apple charges too much for SSD storage. Like way too much. The base Mac mini M4, with 16GB RAM and a paltry 256GB SSD, costs $599 / £599. And while it really is one of the best bargains in computing history, that's despite the storage on offer, rather than because of it. Doubling it to 512GB costs another $200 / £200, and bumping it up to 1TB doubles that again. The maximum SSD size available on the base M4 is 2TB – and for that you'd pay a whopping $1,399 / £1,399. That's $800 / £800 extra for another 1.75TB of SSD storage. There's no 4TB model available on the base M4, but if you step up to the M4 Pro – which has other benefits, such as a more powerful 12- or 14-core CPU and 16- or 20-core GPU – you can upgrade to a 4TB or 8TB SSD. For that privilege, you would pay an astonishing $600 / £600 extra for the jump from 2TB to 4TB, and then a further $1,200 / £1,200 to take you to 8TB.

How does that compare to third-party storage? Not well. Ourbest SSDbuying guide lists nine options, that have all been thoroughly tested and TechRadar-approved. Number one in the list, theSamsung 990 Pro, currently costs $100/£90 for 1TB – which works out at around 10 cents / 9 pence per GB. Jump up to the 4TB model and the price per GB drops to 7.5 cents, or 6 pence. Factor in that the 990 Pro is one of the most expensive options and you can see the difference here – it's roughly a quarter of the price of going direct with Apple. The flipside is that you will need to buy an external enclosure too, but these are not expensive. And nor do you need to worry about it being a difficult installation process. The most complicated thing about all of this, if you're not particularly techie, is simply the terminology around it all. You have two options for upgrading your Mac mini's storage:a portable SSD or an internal SSD plus an external enclosure. The former is simpler, in that you just buy one off the shelf and plug it in to a port on the mini, but they're generally more expensive per GB and almost certainly slower. Still, if you want to take your storage on the road with you, this might be your best bet; our guide to thebest portable SSDshas plenty of options. I took the other route, which involved buying an internal SSD and a separate enclosure, or case, to put it in; I'll go into details on that below. This has the advantage of being fast enough to rival the mini's internal SSD – well, so long as you buy the right one. If you're coming to the Mac mini M4 from a MacBook, the ports on offer will be a welcome surprise: you get two USB-C 3 ports and a 3mm headphone socket on the front, plus three Thunderbolt 4 / USB-C 4 ports, HDMI and Ethernet on the rear. M.2:The SSD's form factor; small, rectangular, like a stick of gum NVMe:The SSD type; massively faster than the older SATA PCie 4.0:The interface bus standard the SSD will connect to. For the fastest speeds this would be 4.0, but the older 3.0 will also do just fine Thunderbolt 4:The connectivity standard used by the Mac mini 4's rear ports. It can charge devices, handle two 4K displays and transfer data via USB USB 4:The USB protocol used by Thunderbolt 4, enabling speeds of up to 40Gb/s USB 3.2:The previous generation of USB standard has a maximum speed of 10Gb/s. The mini's two front USB-C ports have this spec External storage can plug into any of those five USB-C ports, but you'll get the fastest speeds from the Thunderbolt 4 options on the rear. These use USB 4, and have a maximum data transfer speed of 40Gb/s, compared to 10Gb/s for the front ports. (The Mac mini M4 Pro, meanwhile, has Thunderbolt 5, which can handle up to 120Gb/s. That's arguably overkill, but then so is the CPU…) Theoretically, the absolute fastest speeds will come from an SSD that can take advantage of USB 4 – look for SSDs listed as PCIe 4.0 or 'Gen4', with above 7,000MB/s read and 6,000MB/s write. TheSamsung990 Pro mentioned above is one such SSD. That said, you won't get those kind of speeds in real-world use, due to USB 4's 40Gb/s limit. You could therefore buy a cheaper PCIe 3.0 card such as the Samsung 970 EVO Plus. It might be a tiny bit slower than a 4.0 SSD, but you won't notice it outside of benchmarks. In terms of form factor and type, meanwhile, there's a dizzying array of jargon associated with SSDs – but there's no need to be confused by it all. Simplymake sure you buy an M.2 NVMe SSD, ideally Gen4 / PCIe 4.0 if you can afford it, and all will be well. Once you've chosen your SSD you'll need something to put it into. It is technically possible to upgrade the Mac mini's internal storage, but this would void your warranty, and given how easy it is to use an enclosure I'm not sure it's worth it. There are dozens of suitable enclosures for SSDs, but all simply provide a home for the storage to slot into, plus a cable to connect to a USB port. Some have active cooling fans, some use passive cooling; given that the Mac mini is almost silent, I hated the idea of spoiling that quiet, so went with a passive option. Once again, you'll need to ensure the enclosure can handle the speed of your SSD and then transfer that speed to the Mac. Therefore, searching for 'M.2 enclosure' will not suffice – you might end up with something that only works with USB 3.2. Instead,you specifically need an M.2 NVMe USB 4 or Thunderbolt 4 enclosure. You can use USB 3.2 if you want, but you'll be limited to about a third of the speed. SSD: Samsung 990 Pro M.2 NVMe 4TB In terms of the SSD, I ended up buying the Samsung 990 Pro M2 NVMe in its 4TB guise. This cost me £257 – which works out at 6 pence per GB. This is definitely overkill for the Mac mini M4, in that I'm only getting about half of its potential speed, with USB 4 being the bottleneck. However, I figured that I may well upgrade the Mac in the next couple of years, and if I do the Samsung SSD can come along for the ride. Plus, we gave it 5 stars in ourSamsung 990 Pro SSD review, so it would seem rude not to pick this. As I said above, you could spend less on a PCIe 3.0 SSD and not lose too much in terms of performance. Either way, you will definitely save money over taking the Apple upgrade. Enclosure: OWC Express 1M2 For the enclosure, I went with the OWC Express 1M2, which cost another £149. This is one of the highest-rated USB 4 enclosures around; we awarded it 4.5 stars in ourOWC Express 1M2 review, and onAmazonit has the same score from more than 200 user reviews. It's a beautifully made thing, with an entirely metal body covered with fins that make possible its passive cooling. It's not small – about the length of the Mac mini itself, albeit much more narrow – and weighs about 250g, but that didn't worry me as it isn't something I'll be moving around very much. More importantly (to me), it looks great next to the Mac mini; many of the cheaper enclosures are black plastic affairs, but I would rather pay slightly extra for the aesthetics. It also has rubber feet on the bottom that keep it stable, plus a USB-C port in which to plug the all-important (and supplied) data cable. I can't praise it enough. I'm no stranger to SSD or RAM upgrades, but even a complete novice will find the OWC Express 1M2 easy to set up – not least because there'sa super-helpful video tutorialon the OWC website. You'll need to remove a couple of screws, then slide off the bottom of the case to reveal the NVMe slot inside. Remove one more screw, insert the SSD, push down to make contact with the thermal pads, put the screws back in and you're away. The whole thing takes about five minutes, max; it's really not a complicated process. Next, you'll need to hook it up to one of the Thunderbolt 4 ports on the back of the Mac mini, then format the drive for use. Make sure you choose APFS, unless you want to also use it with Macs running an older version of macOS (in which case go for Mac OS Extended) or Windows (ExFAT, generally). Any SSD will be fast enough for most people, particularly if you're used to an old-school hard drive. However, if you're going down the external route rather than buying an Apple upgrade, you'll want your solution to be at least comparable to the internal SSD. It's worth noting that the SSDs in Apple's mac Mini M4s vary in speed depending on the size; the 512GB SSD is about 30% faster than the 256GB model,according to discussions on Redditat least, and the 1TB model is faster still. I'm only using the 256GB model, of course, and get a speed of around 2,000 MB/s write and 2,800 MB/s read, based on BlackMagicDesign's Disk Speed Test. The Samsung 990 Pro plus OWC 1M2 combo, meanwhile, gives me 3,100 for both write and read – so, slightly faster than the internal SSD. Nor does it get too hot. The 1M2 does a fantastic job of keeping it cool whilst in use, and while you can feel it heating up, it's never uncomfortably warm. In real life, the difference in speed between the internal and external drives is irrelevant; either one can copy a 5GB file in a matter of seconds. But psychologically, it's great – not only have I saved myself at least £400, but I've even improved the performance, too. The result is that I can treat my external storage almost as if it's internal. I have folders on it, I have applications running from it, I have lots and lots of music and photos stored on it – and I'd never know it wasn't sitting inside the Mac mini itself if I didn't look at it. It's one of the best upgrades I've ever made. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

    "title": "The Summer I Turned Pretty season 3: everything we know so far about the hit Prime Video show’s return",
    "article_text": "The Summer I Turned Pretty season 3 arrives in July When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. - Releasing on Prime Video in July- Comprised of 11 episodes- No official trailer, but a short teaser from filming- Main cast to return- Season 3 will be the show’s last- Writer/showrunner Jenny Han has vision for more The Summer I Turned Prettyseason 3 is officially coming to Prime Video in July, but it will also be the show’s last. It should come as no surprise really considering the show is based off the book trilogy by showrunner Jenny Han. So, what's next for one of thebest Prime Video shows? Well, there’s plenty of story left to tell and one more dreamy summer in Cousins Beach to endure as the love triangle between Belly and the Fisher brothers plays out. That's one final season to unravel the love shared between the three of them, which so far has been tumultuous at best. And it's up to one of thebest streaming servicesto bringThe Summer I Turned Prettyto our screens for the last time. We'll watch on as love, heartbreak, and the touching coming-of-age tale plays out over one final perfect summer. Here's everything we know aboutThe Summer I Turned Prettyseason 3 from release date, to cast, to plot and more. A post shared by The Summer I Turned Pretty (@thesummeriturnedpretty) A photo posted by on WhileThe Summer I Turned Prettyseason 3 was announced back in August 2023, the show has been officially confirmed to release on Prime Video in July. That’s two years after season 2, but there’s a good reason. When the show was renewed, Prime Video added to theirofficial Instagram post: “Season 3 was greenlit ahead of the strikes and production will not begin until after negotiations are resolved.” Fortunately,Deadlinerevealed that filming commenced in May 2024 and just over a year later, we'll finally get to enjoy the show's final summer outing in July. Thanks to an update from Jenny Han duringAmazon's Upfront presentation (as perDeadline), we also know that this season will be 11-episodes long, which in previous seasons has only been seven and eight respectively. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. we’re officially rolling on #TheSummerITurnedPretty Season 3. 11 episodes coming your way. see you in Cousins in 2025 🫶 pic.twitter.com/uk7ewxvebrMay 14, 2024 We don’t have aThe Summer I Turned Prettyseason 3 trailer just yet. For now, we have a teaser clip from filming back in May 2024. In just 11 seconds, Lola Tung, who plays Belly, is seen hitting a beach ball around with Steven, Conrad, Jeremiah and Rachel before saying, “See you summer 2025.” That's all we have for now, but we'll be sure to update you with a full trailer once we have one. Thanks to the small teaser seen above, forThe Summer I Turned Prettyseason 3, we know that five of the main cast members will return. We'd also expect two more names to return, especially given flashbacks of previous seasons: One character definitely not returning is Aunt Julia. Notorious in season 2 for trying to sell the Fisher boys’ late mom’s beach house, Kyra Sedgwick, who played Julia, toldPeoplein June 2024, “I’m not in season 3. No, no, no. Spoiler alert.” As to whether Julia’s daughter, Skye, played by Elsie Fisher, will return is still unclear. Full spoilers forThe Summer I Turned Prettyseasons 1 & 2 to follow. Plus, potential spoilers for season 3. As a trilogy, it’s not surprising to hear thatThe Summer I Turned Prettyis rumored to be based on the third and final book,We'll Always Have Summer, where Belly makes her final choice between Conrad and Jeremiah. Yes, the season 2 finale felt 'final', but it is never quite the case with Belly and the Fisher boys. Belly seemingly made her final choice picking Jeremiah and it all felt very definitive with Conrad dramatically returning the infinity necklace. But, there's always Susannah's final request for Belly to look out for Conrad which means they'll always have a bond. There's certainly more to come for Belly and her rollercoaster ride of emotions in season 3. Speaking at theTeen Vogue Summitin 2024, the show’s writer Jenny Han said of Belly’s final summer: “I’ll tell you guys, season 3 is a lot. She goes through the ringer.” While the love triangle is a major part of the show's plot, there's still Belly's coming-of-age story at its core, which is set to continue in season 3: “We’re just with her every step of the way and hopefully having empathy for her and empathy for ourselves in moments where we have acted less than perfectly. I think it’s hard to see characters really like go through it or make these big mistakes and say those things that they really regret.” So, we know that season 2 ended with Belly and Jeremiah. But, if you take the plot of Han’s final book, there's plot twists and heartfelt moments that steer the tale into its final direction. Without giving too much away, in the book Belly and Jeremiah attend the same college together, Finch University, and their relationship is certainly not linear (but when has iteverbeen?). If you've not read the book, we won't delve into the storyline too much in fear of ruining season 3, but there's one last thing to add. In the season 2 finale, Susannah is seen during a flashback writing letters before she passed away. This plays a pivotal part in Han's final book and that's all we'll say about that. Of course, there's always potential to steer away from the books. Speaking toUs Weekly, Gavin Casalegno showed support for this bold move: “I do feel like there’s a strong chance that that’s a possibility. I try to keep it as real as possible in that regard. Obviously, I know where he ends up going and what ends up happening. But I don’t emphasize on that. Because I think Jenny writes it so well that I’m able to kind of get there naturally without having to force it a certain direction.” And something that doesn't happen in the books is Belly heading to Paris. But,Teen Voguereported in October 2024 that Lola Tung had been \"spotted by fans around Paris shooting varying scenes in train stations, as well as out on random streets around town.\" So, perhaps a swerve away from the books is in store. Though, at time of writing, no official plot has been revealed. Meanwhile, we also have Steven and Taylor's relationship to enjoy, which again is not part of the books. Officially becoming a couple towards the end of season 2, their relationship has blossomed throughout the show and there's clearly more to explore for the show's other romantic pairing. Speaking to Deadline, Casalegno said: “I’m really excited to see what comes next for all of us in the show itself, especially for Jeremiah and Belly’s final moments in Season 2.\" WhileThe Summer I Turned Prettyseason 3 is the show’s last, it's not necessarily the last we'll see of the characters, with scope to move in a different direction. Speaking to Deadline in September 2023, Amazon and MGM Studios head of TV, Vernon Sanders hinted of more to come: \"This show is going to continue to be a huge centerpiece for us, and we absolutely have plans to continue building it. Jenny’s got great vision for where she wants to go with all of it, but we’re already hard at work developing complementary pieces.\" And when asked what complementary pieces means, Sanders added: “I will say stay tuned, but Jenny’s got some exciting surprises. So we’re thrilled about a season 3, and she’s got a vision for more.” It's no new endeavour for Jenny Han to expand on her much-loved books. She has, after all, released three Netflix movies based off of herTo All the Boys I've Loved Beforetrilogy. From these movies came spin-off TV showXO, Kitty,following the life of Lara Jean's younger sister. Whether Han would take one of the characters in their own direction hasn't been confirmed, but knowing that she has more ideas would certainly prompt us to say, watch this space.

    "title": "Europeans canceling trips to US – FT",
    "article_text": "The US has suffered a sharp fall in tourism from Europe amid political tensions and fears of hostile interactions at the US border under President Donald Trump, Financial Times wrote on Friday. Trump has taken an aggressive approach in global affairs, having recently imposed sweeping tariffs on America’s trade partners. While he has postponed them for most countries for 90-days, China was not included in the reprieve. Washington and Beijing have since exchanged blow-for-blow tariff hikes, sending shockwaves through global stock markets. Trump’s policies have hurt international consumer sentiment, co-founder of travel website Kayak Paul English told FT. “In just two months [Trump] has destroyed the reputation of the US, shown one way by diminished travel from the EU to the US,”English told the outlet.“This is not only one more terrible blow to the US economy, it also represents reputation damage that could take generations to repair.” Overnight visitors to the US from Western Europe fell by 17% in March compared to last year, FT wrote, citing a report by the International Trade Administration (ITA). Travel from countries such as Ireland, Norway, and Germany dropped by more than a fifth, the newspaper said. Several European countries have updated their travel advisories, warning of increased risks associated with traveling to the US. The total number of international visitors entering the US fell by 12% in March – the sharpest drop since 2021, when the sector was still impacted by pandemic-related travel restrictions, FT wrote, citing ITA data. The downward trend poses a threat to the US tourism industry, which accounts for 2.5% of the country’s $29 trillion GDP, according to the outlet. Oxford-based research firm Tourism Economics lowered its projection of international visitor arrivals to the US for 2025 by 18% compared to prior estimates, forecasting a 9.4% decline after Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs announcement last week. Negative sentiment, border policy, unfavorable exchange rates, and economic uncertainty will all work against the US travel sector, the company predicted. Tourism Economics President Adam Sacks pointed out that Trump’s aggressive rhetoric towards Canada, the EU, and Greenland has a“significant effect on sentiment towards the US, and therefore travel.” The US president has repeatedly pushed for US annexation of NATO allies Canada and Danish overseas territory Greenland since his inauguration.",

    "title": "UK moves toward nationalizing last steel plant",
    "article_text": "The British government has opened the door to nationalizing the last primary steelmaking plant in the UK in an emergency bid to keep its blast furnaces running. According to British Steel’s owner, Chinese company Jingye, the Scunthorpe plant has been operating at a loss of some £700,000 ($916,000) a day, affected by President Donald Trump’s 25% tariffs on steel imports into the US, massive CO2 emission fees, and high UK energy prices. The factory’s parent company reportedly turned down a £500 million offer from the British government to keep its blast furnace“virgin steel production”working. On Saturday, Prime Minister Keir Starmer recalled lawmakers from Easter recess to pass an emergency bill that would allow the UK to step in and take control of any“steel undertaking”at risk of stoppage. Such a recall of parliament has not happened since the Falklands War in 1982. “The Secretary of State may do anything for the purpose of securing the continued and safe use of the specified assets [of] the steel undertaking”in the event the assets“are at risk of ceasing to be used,”thebillpassed on Saturday reads. Starmer said the government had stepped in to protect UK steel manufacturing. “All options are on the table to secure the future of the industry,”he said in a statement on X on Saturday. Jingye retains ownership of the plant as of now, but nationalization is a“likely option,”according to State Secretary for Business and Trade Jonathan Reynolds. The UK is currently looking for a company to buy and take over British Steel, according to the BBC. In a statement to the British state broadcaster, Reynolds said that the market value of the business was“effectively zero”and the UK taxpayer would have to shoulder the steel plant’s £700,000 a day losses.",

    "title": "US and Iran talk again. Is war really off the table?",
    "article_text": "The United States and Iran have reopened high-level diplomatic talks over Tehran’s nuclear program, holding their first indirect negotiations in years. The meeting took place in Muscat, Oman, with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi leading Tehran’s delegation and US Special Presidential Envoy Steve Witcoff representing Washington. This marks the highest level of engagement between the two nations since 2018. The talks were conducted via shuttle diplomacy: the two delegations were housed in separate rooms, with Oman’s Foreign Minister Badr bin Hamad al-Busaidi acting as the go-between. Following the session, Araghchi described the meeting as a constructive first step.“For a first round, the discussions were positive,”he said in an interview with Iranian state television.“They were held in a calm, respectful environment, free from inflammatory language. Both sides seemed committed to moving the process forward toward a workable agreement.” The White House echoed this sentiment in a brief statement, describing the talks as“very positive and constructive.”It emphasized that Witcoff had been instructed to pursue diplomacy wherever possible and work toward resolving disagreements through dialogue. President Donald Trump, when asked about the talks by reporters, offered a guarded endorsement.“I think they’re going well,”he said.“But nothing matters until it’s done. I don’t like talking about it too much. Still, it’s moving along.” Despite his aggressive rhetoric and an expanded US military presence in the region, Trump has continued to express an interest in diplomacy. He announced the resumption of talks while seated beside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – an especially significant moment, as Netanyahu likely anticipated a stronger show of support for possible military action against Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. Instead, Trump emphasized the need for negotiation, signaling either a strategic pause or possibly a broader plan that prioritizes political leverage over immediate confrontation. In Tehran, officials have responded with skepticism. Although Iran has never entirely ruled out dialogue with the West and had hoped for a diplomatic thaw, state-affiliated media outlet NourNewsframedTrump’s comments as a“psychological operation”aimed at shaping a narrative that benefits Washington both at home and abroad. Iran, for its part, is approaching talks with a pragmatic but firm set of demands. Officials have outlined clear conditions that must be met before any deal can be reached. Chief among them: lifting key sanctions – particularly those affecting the energy and banking sectors – unfreezing Iranian assets held in foreign banks (notably in Europe and East Asia), and securing firm guarantees against future US or Israeli military strikes. These demands reflect deep-rooted distrust. From Tehran’s perspective, the US withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal – despite Iran’s compliance and its acknowledgement by US allies like the UK, Germany, and France – stands as proof that Washington’s commitments can’t be trusted. Whether the US is prepared to meet Iran’s terms remains uncertain. Trump has long portrayed himself as a leader who can strike deals and avoid drawn-out wars, a narrative that plays well with his political base. But his track record with Iran suggests otherwise. The US has repeatedly walked away from agreements without meaningful consequences, reinforcing the Iranian view that verbal or even signed commitments from Washington are not strategically reliable. This gap between rhetorical diplomacy and concrete guarantees is now front and center. Tehran insists on binding, measurable terms. But from Washington’s perspective, offering sweeping concessions could be seen as a loss of leverage. That puts both sides at an impasse: Iran is asking for assurances the US is reluctant to give, while the US expects compromise from a country whose regional influence has diminished. Iran’s negotiating position has indeed weakened. A decade ago, it could rely on a strong network of regional proxies – Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas, and various Shiite groups in Iraq and Syria. Today, many of those assets have been degraded or sidelined. While Iran still holds sway in Iraq, even Baghdad is now pursuing a more balanced foreign policy that includes closer ties with the US, Gulf nations, and Türkiye, further limiting Tehran’s regional reach. In short, Iran is making maximalist demands from a position of reduced leverage. That makes it unlikely Washington will grant significant concessions in the near term. Both sides are stuck: Iran is pushing for guarantees the US doesn’t want – or isn’t able – to give, while the US expects flexibility from an increasingly isolated adversary. Which raises the looming question: What if talks collapse? We cannot completely dismiss the assumption that Trump may be using diplomacy to set the stage for a military confrontation. His administration’s past actions – exiting the 2015 deal, ordering the assassination of General Qassem Soleimani, expanding sanctions, and reinforcing US military positions in the region – have consistently undercut chances for dialogue. So while these talks may be genuine, they could also serve to justify future military action if diplomacy fails. AnalystsbelieveWashington is considering two main options for striking Iran’s nuclear infrastructure, especially in Natanz and Fordow. One scenario involves a joint operation with the Israeli Air Force. The other envisions a solo Israeli strike. In either case, precision airstrikes involving advanced munitions are expected. Iran’s air defense systems areunlikelyto repel such an assault – especially if the US deploys B-2 stealth bombers or GBU-57 bunker-busting bombs. A full-scale strike could seriously damage both above-ground and underground facilities. Historically, Iran has relied on asymmetric retaliation, targeting adversaries through non-conventional means. But its ability to respond this way has eroded. Hezbollah has sustained major losses amid stepped-up Israeli military campaigns, and Syria – once a linchpin of Iran’s strategy under Bashar al-Assad – has effectively fallen under the influence of Tehran’s rivals. Given this shift, Iran would likely rely primarily on its own resources in any counter-strike. While more isolated than before, it still wields a diverse array of tools: ballistic missiles, attack drones, cyber capabilities, and regional proxy operations. One probable form of retaliation would be missile and drone strikes on Israel. That’s not just speculation – Tehran executed limited but unprecedented attacks in 2024. In one case, it launched roughly 200 missiles, some of which bypassed Israeli air defenses and hit Nevatim Air Base. These actions signaled Iran’s intent and capacity to respond forcefully. While Israel maintains one of the world’s most advanced air defense systems, such attacks could still carry serious political and strategic consequences. American bases in the region are also potential targets. The US maintains a sprawling military footprint across the Middle East – including in Iraq, Qatar, Kuwait, Jordan, Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia – with roughly 40,000 troops stationed there as of late 2024. These facilities have already been hit by Iran-backed groups. In January, a drone launched from Iraqi territory breached US defenses in Jordan, killing three service members. Iran also retaliated for Soleimani’s killing in 2020 by launching direct missile strikes on two American bases in Iraq, resulting in dozens of concussions among personnel. Compared to Israeli targets, US bases are generally closer to Iran and its regional proxies – and less well-protected – making them attractive targets for both conventional and asymmetric retaliation. Still, striking US forces carries far greater risks, potentially triggering an overwhelming American response. In line with its asymmetric playbook, Iran might also seek to apply pressure through regional partners. Gulf nations such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait – key logistical and military allies of the US – could find themselves in the crosshairs. Iran has already warned these governments that allowing American forces to use their territory or airspace would be seen as an act of war. However, attacking these countries directly would carry high stakes, particularly in light of Iran’s recent diplomatic thaw with Riyadh in early 2023. Should Iran pursue this path, it’s more likely to focus its retaliation on US assets rather than Arab infrastructure. Another element in Tehran’s deterrence playbook is the threat to close the Strait of Hormuz – a critical choke point for global oil and LNG shipments. Around 20% of the world’s oil exports and more than 30% of all liquefied natural gas passes through this narrow corridor. Any blockade could cause energy prices to spike and throw global markets into turmoil. Still, such a move could backfire. Iran’s economy depends heavily on oil and gas exports, and disrupting that flow would cut into its own revenues. A closure would also risk damaging relations with key economic partners – especially China, the largest buyer of Iranian oil. Unlike the US, China’s energy security is directly tied to Hormuz’s stability, and any disruption could be seen as a threat to Beijing’s national interests. *** At this point, all eyes are on whether the talks can gain even modest traction. A minimal diplomatic breakthrough could delay – or even prevent – the kinds of escalatory measures now being discussed. In a region where the stakes are as high as the distrust is deep, even small steps toward diplomacy might be a best-case scenario – for now.",

    "article_text": "Tens of thousands of people have been gathering in Belgrade since Friday to show support for President Aleksandar Vucic in the face of significant anti-government protests in Serbia. Student-led demonstrations against alleged corruption and government negligence have been ongoing in the country for months. The protests, sparked by the deadly collapse of a concrete canopy at the railway station in the city of Novy Sad in November 2024, culminated in a massive rally in Belgrade on March 15, which was followed by clashes between dozens of protesters and the police. During the demonstrations filmed by RT on Saturday Vucic declared that“the color revolution is over,”adding that“they can walk as much as they wish, but nothing will come out of that.” Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban addressed the rally via video link, stating,“Serbian patriots can count on their Hungarian counterparts.” The opposition Freedom and Justice Party (SSP) has accused security forces of utilizing a Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD), crowd-control technology originally designed by the US Navy and which poses a significant risk of hearing damage, at the protests on March 15. Vucic’s government has alleged that the US“deep state”and European intelligence agencies are inciting the wave of protests in retaliation for Serbia’s refusal to endorse anti-Russian policies.",

    "title": "Chinese under 50kg warned to stay home to avoid being ‘blown away’",
    "article_text": "China has urged residents in the northern part of the country who weigh less than 50kg to stay indoors, warning they could be“easily blown away”as powerful winds sweep through the region, according to local media. The country’s weather agency has issued five warnings for this weekend, covering wind, rain, snow, and thunderstorms, with gusts reaching level 13; wind strength is measured on a scale from one to 17. According to the China Meteorological Administration, level 11 winds can cause“serious damage,”while level 12 winds bring“extreme destruction.” An orange-level wind alert – the second-highest in China’s four-tier system – was issued in the capital on Friday for the first time in a decade. The storm, triggered by a cold vortex moving south from Mongolia, brought gusts of up to 150 kph across Beijing, Tianjin, and parts of Hebei. Authorities warned that the winds were strong enough to uproot trees with trunks up to 30cm in diameter. To minimize damage, city parks were closed and older trees were trimmed or reinforced. Despite these measures, nearly 300 trees have been knocked over, damaging several vehicles. No injuries were reported. Officials also advised Beijing’s 22 million residents to avoid non-essential travel. “Everyone in Beijing was really nervous about it. Today there are hardly any people out on the streets. However, it wasn’t as severe as I had imagined,”one resident told Reuters. Another local, a 30-year-old with the last name Li, added:“It wasn’t as severe as I had imagined – not to the point where it was impossible to go out – though it is having some impact on daily life.” The storm has also disrupted transport. More than 400 flights were canceled at Beijing Capital International Airport, and several rail services were suspended. While supermarkets remained open, shelves were quickly emptied. In Hebei’s Shijiazhuang and Laiyuan County, falling trees and debris forced road closures, and sandstorms prompted additional nighttime shutdowns. Further west, Gansu and Ningxia also reported sandstorms, with visibility dropping to 50 meters in some areas.",

    "title": "Iran and US unveil results of nuclear talks",
    "article_text": "Iran and the United States held their first diplomatic engagement in years on Saturday in the Omani capital of Muscat, with discussions focused on Tehran’s nuclear program and the potential easing of US sanctions. The two-and-a-half-hour talks were led by Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi and White House Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff. Although the negotiations were conducted indirectly through Omani mediation, the heads of the two delegations – Araghchi and Witkoff – briefly spoke face-to-face in the presence of Oman’s Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi after the formal talks concluded. Addressing reporters in Muscat, Araghchi described the first round of negotiations as“constructive”and held in a“calm and very respectful atmosphere.” “No inappropriate language was used, and the two sides demonstrated their commitment to advancing the talks until the achievement of a mutually favorable agreement from an equal position,”the Iranian minister said. According to Araghchi, both sides aim to outline a general framework for a future agreement in the next round of talks. He indicated that the second meeting is scheduled for April 19, although it may not take place in Muscat. “In the next round of the talks, we will try to enter the negotiations agenda, which will of course have a timetable alongside it,”he said, expressing hope that the two sides could finalize a plan for starting“real talks”soon. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Saturday night, President Donald Trump said the talks with Tehran“are going okay.” Nothing matters until you get it done, so I don’t like talking about it. But it’s going okay. The Iran situation is going pretty good. Meanwhile, the White House emphasized that – despite Tehran’s insistence on indirect talks – Witkoff met Araghchi face-to-face, calling the“direct communication a step forward in achieving a mutually beneficial outcome.” Witkoff, a close confidant of President Trump and Washington’s lead negotiator with Moscow, has also played a prominent role in regional diplomacy. Even before the president returned to office, Witkoff was credited with convincing Israel to agree to a Gaza truce. The next round of negotiations with Iran is expected to take place on April 19. While both sides have expressed cautious optimism, analysts noted that significant challenges remain. Iranian officials have publicly opposed major concessions, while President Trump has reportedly given negotiators a two-month deadline, warning of possible military action if talks fail.",

    "article_text": "The US leader’s confidant spent over four hours behind closed doors discussing aspects of a potential settlement of the Ukraine conflict with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday, before heading to Oman for high-level talks on Iran’s nuclear program on Saturday. White House special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff reportedly managed toconvince Israelto agree to a Gaza truce in just one meeting – even before US President Donald Trump took office – and has since become one of the key Americannegotiators on Ukraine. When he traveled to Russia for the third time in two months – a video of Witkoff smiling and shaking hands with Putin emerged on Friday – critics rushed to accuse him of everything from acting too cozy and perpetuating“Russian propaganda,”to being too“inexperienced”to conduct negotiations and effectively“taking over”the role of US Secretary of State. “People love attacking Steve Witkoff, but he has done more to advance peace negotiations & hostage releases than any of his career bureaucrat critics have done during their entire careers in the Swamp,”conservative activist Laura Loomer wrote on X, adding that“Steve Witkoff is busting his ass for President Trump.” 100%https://t.co/DOX5rgjhpg “Witkoff is great,”agreedbillionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, another of Trump’s closest allies, who leads Washington’s government waste-cutting task force DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency). US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also“100%”agreed with Loomer’s post. Witkoff’s first visit to Russia in February resulted in a high-profile prisoner exchange and paved the way for a phone call between the countries’ leaders, kickstarting the resumption of diplomatic relations. Just ahead of Witkoff’s third visit on Friday, Russia and the US conducted another prisoner swap in Abu Dhabi. The discussions between President Putin and Steve Witkoff on Friday involved“aspects of the settlement of the Ukraine conflict,”the Kremlin has announced, declining to provide further details.",

    "title": "ENHYPEN Just Rocked Coachella in Cowboy-Themed Custom Prada",
    "article_text": "The enormously popular South Korean boy band ENHYPEN is currently making major moves in North America. The septet just launched its new single “Loose,” an upbeat English-language pop track. On Thursday, they made their US television debut by performing the song on Jimmy Kimmel Live!—an impressive showing of both perfectly timed choreography andadoringly raucous fans. And the rollout continued on Saturday night, with the K-pop group taking the stage at Coachella for the very first time. ENHYPEN celebrated the occasion with a suite of custom looks from Prada, featuring acowboycore aestheticheavy on vests, rhinestones, and vintage-inspired denim. “I heard only a handful of global artists have had custom stage outfits made by Prada, so it feels both surreal and incredibly special to be the first K-pop act to receive that opportunity,” ENHYPEN’s Jungwon toldGQprior to the performance. “The beadwork and details are going to shine even under the stage lights, which makes our first Coachella performance even more meaningful.” All seven members sported oversized jeans, brown leather belts with metal buckles, and silk neckerchiefs in a spectrum of tones, combined with individually customized outerwear adorned with silk inserts, mother-of-pearl buttons, contrasting piping, and leather collars. ENHYPEN’s Heeseung said that performing in the Prada looks “makes the whole experience feel even more significant.” His bandmate Jay, meanwhile, suggested that the outfits would have an effect on the quality of the music as well: “Coachella is such an iconic stage, so of course there are some nerves going into it,” he said. “But knowing we’re going up there in Prada’s custom outfits as global ambassadors gives us a boost of confidence. I believe it’ll help us deliver an even better performance.” An initial sketch of ENHYPEN’s denim-heavy Coachella looks by Prada. ENHYPEN have been Prada ambassadors since 2023, and this stellar stage wardrobe demonstrates precisely why the Italian house and the band are such a perfect match. The wild west theme is bang on for Coachella, which practically begs for this level of sartorial extravagance. “The styles fit Coachella’s energy so well,” Sunoo toldGQ. “Prada really captured the summer festival vibe of Coachella with these looks,” Ni-Ki agreed. “I can’t wait to see how it all comes together on stage.”",

    "title": "Trump Watches UFC Fight in Miami with Musk and a Smattering of Cabinet Members",
    "article_text": "PresidentDonald Trumpmade his way to Miamion Saturday to sit ringside at the Ultimate Fighting Championship featherweight contest. His first return to UFC since taking office, Trump was alongside cabinet members and friends in an environment he’s long felt at home in. An avid UFC fan, the president was greeted by a standing ovation asKid Rock’s “American Bad Ass” played in the background—a go-to song choice for Trump. The warm welcome follows a week of market tumult spurred by hisongoing tariffsagainst, and trade wars with, countries across the globe. Dana White, the president and CEO of UFC, and a longtime friend of Trump, was beside the president throughout the night. On election night in November, when Trump clenched the presidency, White gave one of the victory speeches. And, days later, Trumpcelebratedat Madison Square Garden for another UFC fight, holding the heavyweight championship belt to cheers from the crowd. US President Donald Trump with Elon Musk and his son X Æ A-12 watch as English fighter Paddy Pimblett celebrates winning the lightweight fight against US fighter Michael Chandler (off frame) during UFC 314 at the Kaseya Center in Miami, Florida. Before the Saturday UFC competition, aboard Air Force One for a brief flight from Palm Beach to Miami, Trump compared the evening’s fight to trade fights that sent financial markets spiraling, according toThe New York Times’Maggie Haberman. “So we’re going to the fight,” Trump said. “We have lots of fights going around the world, and I think we have a lot of good news coming soon about some of those fights, and we’ll see how it goes. But it’s been an interesting weekend. I think we have some pretty good news coming on some of the conflicts.” President Donald Trump (R) speaks with UFC CEO Dana White during UFC 314 at Kaseya Center on April 12, 2025 in Miami, Florida. Trump's allegiance to UFC aligns with a substantial chunk of his base. According toreportingfrom Vox based on the sports data site IMG Arena, 75 percent of UFC’s fans are men, and 88 percent of those men are between the ages of 18 and 44. During the past election,all ages of menhelped put Trump in office again, including young men—a demographic that former presidentJoe Bidenwonin 2020. He was joined ringside by podcasterJoe Rogan—whoformally threw his supportbehind Trump after conducting an hours-longinterviewwith him on the campaign trail—and the wealthiest person in the world,Elon Musk,dullingrumors that he and the president may be on the outs. Muskbroughtone of his 14 children. FBI director,Kash Patel, Secretary of StateMarco Rubio, the director of national intelligence,Tulsi Gabbard, and Health and Human Services SecretaryRobert F. Kennedy Jr.and his wife, the actressCheryl Hines, were also near Trump. In a moment that has gained traction online, Trump appeared to snub Hines. Upon arrival, Trump tried to shake Kennedy’s hand, though he was looking in the other direction. “Mr. Trump then walked past the outstretched hand of Ms. Hines, moving his gaze past her entirely despite appearing to see her,” Haberman reported. Hines looked at her hand and then her husband, seemingly confused. While Kennedy and Hines then walked over to Trump and spoke cordially, the video hassparkeddiscussion online. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. The main event of the night was a championship battle between Australian former championAlexander Volkanovskiand Brazilian fighterDiego Lopes, who were dueling it out for the featherweight championship title. Volkanovski won. After the fights, Trump made his way back to Palm Beach. He’svisitedthe state ten times since he was sworn in—often toplay golfat one of his private clubs.

It doesn't get better than this, folks. It's been 15 years since Hamm last hosted the show, which doesn't seem right somehow (though doesn't count his 14 cameos in the meantime).

    "article_text": "Charity House of Joy and Mercy says it plans to let the public view its ‘pampered’ new resident Miu Miu An animal shelter in Hong Kong that adopted a runaway emu plans to allow the public to view the animal in the future, with the goal of becoming the flightless bird’s forever home. House of Joy and Mercy director Ivy Tse Yuen-yee has described the male emu, now named Miu Miu, as a “pampered little princess” that is picky with his food and throws temper tantrums by refusing to move. “We need to see Miu Miu’s condition, but if he is suited for it, we would open up to the public and let the public see him,” she said. “We would want to keep him and take care of him until the end of his life.” Tse said the shelter currently did not have any specific plans about how it would allow the public to view the animal, citing the need to consider factors such as the size of the crowds and staffing arrangements. Miu Miu was captured by authorities in May last year after the bird was spotted attempting to race motorists and strolling through a public housing estate in Tin Shui Wai. The bird was placed in the care of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, which kept Miu Miu in one of its animal management centres.",

    "article_text": "Hong Kong’s islands and stunning coastline could be a major tourist draw with the right infrastructure, policy reforms and marketing Returning from her visit, Hong Kong’s Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law Shuk-pui said Xia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, spoke of how Hong Kong could innovate within the tourism sector. Indeed, Hong Kong’s islands and coastline hold vast tourism potential, their breathtaking natural wonders blending with the city’s rich cultural heritage. It sets the scene for business travellers to experience both the bustling city and the tranquil islands – a Hong Kong of dual charms, as both a city of neon lights and a calm resort, and all within a short stay. The government should fully leverage Hong Kong’s tourism resources to offer island-hopping, particularly in relation to business tourism. 03:41 Volunteers send food to keep wild cows alive on Hong Kong’s desolate Tap Mun",

    "title": "Thousands rally for Serbia’s Vucic amid student-led protests (VIDEOS)",
    "article_text": "Tens of thousands of people have been gathering in Belgrade since Friday to show support for President Aleksandar Vucic in the face of significant anti-government protests in Serbia. Student-led demonstrations against alleged corruption and government negligence have been ongoing in the country for months. The protests, sparked by the deadly collapse of a concrete canopy at the railway station in the city of Novy Sad in November 2024, culminated in a massive rally in Belgrade on March 15, which was followed by clashes between dozens of protesters and the police. During the demonstrations filmed by RT on Saturday Vucic declared that“the color revolution is over,”adding that“they can walk as much as they wish, but nothing will come out of that.” Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban addressed the rally via video link, stating,“Serbian patriots can count on their Hungarian counterparts.” The opposition Freedom and Justice Party (SSP) has accused security forces of utilizing a Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD), crowd-control technology originally designed by the US Navy and which poses a significant risk of hearing damage, at the protests on March 15. Vucic’s government has alleged that the US“deep state”and European intelligence agencies are inciting the wave of protests in retaliation for Serbia’s refusal to endorse anti-Russian policies.",
