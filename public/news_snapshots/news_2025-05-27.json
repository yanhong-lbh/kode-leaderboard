    "title": "Beer drinkers beware: Scientists find 'forever chemicals' exceeding EPA limits in American brews",
    "article_text": "National Security Institute's Jamil Jaffer discusses a man driving a car into a crowd in Liverpool on 'Fox News Live.' Recent studies have found thatsome beers brewedin the US have high levels of \"forever chemicals\" and are considered above the allowed EPA limit. A team from the ACS’ Environmental Science & Technology conducted a study to find out how polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) or \"forever chemicals\" get into beers and how much they contain. \"As an occasional beer drinker myself, I wondered whether PFAS in water supplies was making its way into our pints. I hope these findings inspire water treatment strategies and policies that help reduce the likelihood of PFAS in future pours,\" research lead Jennifer Hoponick Redmon said. ALCOHOL DEATHS HAVE MORE THAN DOUBLED IN RECENT YEARS, ESPECIALLY AMONG WOMEN A study has found that there are high levels of ‘Forever Chemicals’ in beers with contaminated water sources in the United States.(iStock) While breweries have water filtration and treatment systems, these are not designed to prevent PFAS from entering into the batch. By modifyingan EPA testingtool for analyzing levels of PFAS in drinking water, Redmon and her team tested 23 beers. NOT ONLY DOES BEER TASTE GREAT, THERE ARE HEALTH BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH IT, TOO: EXPERT By modifying an EPA testing tool for analyzing levels of PFAS in drinking water, Redmon and her team tested 23 beers.(iStock) The teamtested beersfrom areas with known documented water system contamination along with some other popular beers with unknown water sources. Through their research, it was found that beer brewed inNorth Carolina, California, and Michigan had elevated levels of this PFAS. The researchers found a strong correlation between PFAS concentrations in municipal drinking water and levels in locally brewed beer. While breweries have water filtration and treatment systems, these are not designed to prevent PFAS from entering into the batch.((Photo by: Geography Photos/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)) In 95% of the beer tested, PFAS was found with perfluorooctanesulfonate and perfluorooctanoic acid, two forever chemicals with recently established EPA limits in drinking water. International beers tested — one from Holland and two fromMexico— were less likely to have detectable PFAS. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Our findings indicate a strong link between PFAS in drinking water and beer, with beers brewed in areas with higher PFAS in local drinking water translating to higher levels of PFAS in beer, showing that drinking water is a primary route of PFAS contamination in beer,\" the research team concluded.

A Republicanlawmaker from Tennesseeis calling for a federal investigation into Nashville Mayor Freddie O'Connell’s handling of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations, adding he will not back down. Tennessee Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., said in a post on X that with support from the House Judiciary Committee, he is formally requesting all documents and communications from O’Connell’s office pertaining to his alleged protection of illegal immigrants. Specifically, Ogles is requesting documents related to \"the amendment of Executive Order 30,\" which he referred to as \"an outrageous directive requiring Nashville employees and first responders to report all communication with federalimmigration authoritiesdirectly to the mayor.\" Ogles also said he is requesting any internal discussions or documents concerning ICE enforcement actions in Nashville or Davidson County and all correspondence involving Metro employees and affiliated nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) pertaining to the arrests or detention of criminal illegal aliens within the city or county.

AGerman university, Göttingen University, has literally \"struck gold\" in recent findings from volcanic rocks. A new study of these volcanic rocksfrom Hawaii, that leaked out from deep under the lithosphere, contained various precious metals. Dr. Nils Messling of theGöttingen University’s Department of Geochemistrysaid in a news release they were surprised when the test results came in. \"When the first results came in, we realized that we had literally struck gold! Our data confirmed that material from the core, including gold and other precious metals, is leaking into theEarth's mantleabove,\" Messling said. LARGEST GOLD DEPOSIT IN THE WORLD WORTH $83 BILLION FOUND IN CHINA 99% of the Earth’s gold is buried deep in the Earth’s Metallic Core, far out of humankind’s reach. The gold is currently buried about 1,800 miles deep in the core.(JUNG YEON-JE/AFP via Getty Images) Approximately 99% of the Earth’s gold is buried deep in theEarth’s Metallic Core, far out of humankind’s reach. The gold is currently buried about 1,800 miles deep in the core. The discovery of this ruthenium, which was formed and locked down with gold, might be a telling sign that these volcanic rocks are coming from deep within the Earth. HAWAII'S KILAUEA VOLCANO ERUPTS WITH 1,000-FOOT ‘LAVA FOUNTAINING’ The precious metals were detected in the volcanic rock potentially meaning that the rocks came from deep within the core or that the materials are beginning to leak out.(USGS) \"Our findings not only show that the Earth’s core is not as isolated as previously assumed. We can now also prove that huge volumes of super-heated mantle material – several hundreds of quadrillion metric tonnes of rock – originate at the core-mantle boundary and rise to the Earth’s surface to form ocean islands like Hawaii,\" said Professor Matthias Willbold in a news release. There is a way totest for isotopesof ruthenium, especially when differences are small variations of the same element. The isotopes of ruthenium in the Earth's core are slightly different from those on the surface, with the difference being too small to really detect. However, new procedures developed by researchers at the University of Göttingen have made it possible. The gold and ruthenium were found in volcanic rock in Hawaii.(iStock) \"Whether these processes that we observe today have also been operating in the past remains to be proven.

(Credit: @GregAbbott_TX / X) Texas Gov.Greg Abbottsigned legislation on Monday which he said makes it \"crystal clear\" that only U.S. citizens are allowed to vote in elections in his state. \"I just signed off on a joint resolution to make it crystal clear under the Texas Constitution that if you are not a citizen of the United States of America, you are not allowed to vote in Texas,\" the governor said in a video posted to X. Texas StateSenatorBrian Birdwell, a Republican, introduced Senate Joint Resolution (SJR) 37 in January, and in the resolution, he proposed a constitutional amendment clarifying that voters in Texas elections must be citizens of the U.S. Prior to the resolution, the constitution prohibited people who are under the age of 18, along with those who were determined mentally incompetent by a court or who were convicted of a felony, from voting in elections.

Last month, a federal judge blocked an executive order signed by President Donald Trump that would require documentary proof of citizenship before being allowed to register to vote. Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia handed down the order in response to lawsuits filed by three separate groups of plaintiffs over five different provisions in aMarch 25 Trump executive orderrelating to election integrity. While Kollar-Kotelly dismissed requests to block three of the provisions, requests to block two other provisions pertaining to a proof of citizenship requirement for voters were granted.

The second sought to require federal agencies offering voter registration to people on public assistance to \"assess\" the individual's citizenship status before doing so. \"Our Constitution entrusts Congress and the States — not the President — with the authority to regulate federal elections. Consistent with that allocation of power,Congress iscurrently debating legislation that would affect many of the changes the President purports to order,\" Kollar-Kotelly, a Clinton-appointee, wrote in her order. \"No statutory delegation of authority to the Executive Branch permits the President to short-circuit Congress’s deliberative process by executive order.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Meanwhile, 25 states, including Texas, are considering some form of proof-of-citizenship legislation, according to theVoting Rights Lab,which is tracking such legislation.

    "title": "King prepares to give key speech backing Canada",
    "article_text": "King Charles III will deliver a significant speech in Canada's parliament later on Tuesday that is expected to offer his support in the country's dispute with US President Donald Trump. The King and Queen Camilla received a warm welcome when they arrived in Ottawa, on the royal couple's first trip to Canada since the start of their reign. Soon after arriving, the King, who is Canada's head of state, held a meeting with Prime Minister Mark Carney, recently elected on a wave of anti-Trump public opinion. Carney has praised the \"historic ties\" that make up Canada's independent identity, including the \"vitality of our constitutional monarchy\", which he said \"crises only fortify\". Carney invited the King to deliver the speech at the opening of parliament after his recent general election victory, in a campaign dominated by the threats to Canada's sovereignty from Trump. It will be the first time in almost 50 years that a monarch gives the \"Speech from the throne\", with the King's decision to come to parliament in Ottawa seen as a symbolic show of support for Canada. The King's speech will be written on the advice of the Canadian government, with the expectation that it will send a clear, if diplomatic, message that the country is \"not for sale\" to the US. Carney said in advance that the speech, to be delivered in French and English, would match \"the weight of our times\". On Monday afternoon, the King and Carney held a meeting at Rideau Hall, the residence of Canada's governor-general, with both men sitting in front of Canadian flags. There were also meetings with leaders of Canada's indigenous and First Nations groups, including Cindy Woodhouse, the national chief of the Assembly of First Nations. Looking relaxed in the Ottawa sunshine, the King took part in a tree-planting ceremony, receiving an enthusiastic reception from onlookers, who cheered and crowded round to shake hands with him. \"Canada feels threatened and scared. It is very important he is here,\" said Theresa McKnight, from Mississauga, Ontario. Her sister Dianne St Louis from near Toronto agreed: \"It's critical. It means a great deal to have the King standing side by side with Canadians.\" There had been a warm welcome at Ottawa airport, for what will be a visit of about 24 hours on the ground in Canada. Carney was on the runway to meet the royal visitors, with a welcoming party that included schoolchildren from English- and French-speaking schools and representatives of First Nations communities. A community event had also been a checklist of Canadian moments, such as the King dropping a puck to start a game of street hockey and getting jars of maple syrup. But the main focus of this trip will be the historic speech on Tuesday, with the prospect of the King delivering the Canadian government's message of rejecting calls to become the US 51st state. It is also a diplomatic balancing act because in his role as head of state of the UK, the King has been part of an effort to keep good relations with Trump, including inviting him for a second state visit. But in Canada, the King will have to speak on behalf of Canada.

    "article_text": "A Canadian man has been sentenced to almost two years in prison for stealing a famous photograph of Sir Winston Churchill known as \"The Roaring Lion\". Jeffrey Wood had pleaded guilty to stealing the original print from Ottawa's Château Laurier hotel between Christmas 2021 and early January 2022.  He also admitted committing forgery. The photo of Britain's war-time prime minister, taken by Yousuf Karsh in 1941, features on the UK £5 note. Ottawa Police said it was found last year in Genoa, Italy in the possession of a private buyer, who was unaware it was stolen. The image depicts a frowning Churchill, who was 67 at the time, shortly after he delivered a speech to the Canadian parliament. It wasn't until August 2022that a hotel staff member realised the original photo had been replaced with a fake. According to Canadian media, Wood said he took the photo to find money for his brother, who was suffering from mental health problems. During sentencing, Justice Robert Wadden said: \"It is a point of national pride that a portrait taken by a Canadian photographer would have achieved such fame.\" \"There is an element of trust in our society that allows such properties to be displayed, to be enjoyed by all Canadians. To steal, damage and traffic in such property is to breach that trust,\" he added. \"We're very happy to see that Canadian history is recognised,\" said Geneviève Dumas, the general manager of the Château Laurier hotel, according to theCanadian Broadcasting Corporation. Wood was sentenced to \"two years less a day\", a distinction which means he will serve his sentence in a provincial institution instead of a federal prison. The lawyer representing Wood said the sentence was \"unnecessarily harsh\" given that he was a first-time offender. King Charles has received a warm welcome in Canada ahead of a historic speech in its parliament. The visit marks the first time for decades that a monarch has formally opened the parliament in Ottawa. Monday was the first of a packed two-day visit meant to highlight Canada's sovereignty and its ties to the Crown. The King and Queen will be arriving in Canada on Monday for a visit seen as a symbol of support.

    "title": "Iran's Palme d'Or-winning director cheered as he arrives home",
    "article_text": "An Iranian filmmaker has been cheered at home after winning Cannes Film Festival's top prize. Jafar Panahi touched down in Tehran's international airport on Monday, two days after his Palme d'Or victory for revenge thriller It Was Just Accident. Panahi has been imprisoned multiple times in Iran, most recently for protesting the detention of filmmakers criticising the authorities. This was his first visit to Cannes in 15 years, where his films have been shown in his absence due to a travel ban. His winning film depicted torture in Iranian jails and ignited a back-and-forth between French and Iranian officials. The celebrated director, who now holds prizes from Europe's three major film festivals, was seen grinning and holding a bouquet of flowers as he embraced his friends. Among the crowd was fellow Iranian film director Medhi Nadari, who shared footage of the moment on Instagram calling Panahi's return \"history-making\". One person was heard shouting \"woman, life, freedom\" as Panahi passed through the airport, according to the Agence France-Presse news agency. The phrase was the slogan for protests that broke out across Iran following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody in 2022. In his acceptance speech at Cannes, Panahi said, \"What's most important now is our country and the freedom of our country,\" and called for Iranians to \"join forces\". \"No-one should dare tell us what kind of clothes we should wear, what we should do, or what we should not do,\" he said. The film's win has given rise to adiplomatic row between French and Iranian officials, after French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot dubbed it \"a gesture of resistance against the Iranian regime's oppression\" in a post on X. IRNA, Iran's state media, reported that a French diplomat had been summoned in Tehran so that it could formally protest the comments as \"insulting and unfounded\". Returning to Tehran fulfils a pledge Panahi made while speaking to reporters in Cannes. \"As soon as I finish my work here I will go back,\" he said, adding \"I will ask myself what's my next film going to be.\" Iranian officials say the remarks are “blatant interference” in the country’s internal affairs. The prestigious film festival was disrupted, about 160,000 homes were without power and businesses were left without power. Jafar Panahi uses his Palme d'Or acceptance speech to send a message against the regime's restrictions. A substation was set on fire and a pylon damaged, interrupting screenings and affecting 160,000 homes. From the hundreds of titles that premiered at this year's Cannes Film Festival, here are the ones which are going to be big talking points all through 2025.",

    "title": "Streeting urges doctors to vote no in strike ballot",
    "article_text": "Health Secretary Wes Streeting has urged doctors in England to \"vote no\" in a ballot on industrial action which gets under way on Tuesday. In a BBC interview, he urged resident doctors, the new name for junior doctors, to \"work with the government\" and warned strikes risked hampering the progress being made in the NHS. He said it was in no-one's interests for strikes to take place. Last week it was announced resident doctors would be getting a 5.4% average pay rise this year - more than other doctors, nurses and teachers. But resident doctors, who took part in 11 strikes in 2023 and 2024, said it was not enough to make up for below-inflation pay awards since 2008. The union is urging members to vote for industrial action, with sources saying strikes would be the likely action taken. This year's pay rise comes after resident doctors were awarded rises worth 22% over the previous two years. Streeting agreed to that deal shortly after coming into office, ending a dispute which had lasted more than a year. Taking account of this year's pay rise, it means the starting salary for a doctor fresh out of university has risen by £9,500 over the past three years to around £38,800, the government said. But the British Medical Association (BMA) said even after the latest pay rise another 20% was needed to bring wages back to where they were in 2008. Resident doctors' committee co-chairs Dr Melissa Ryan and Dr Ross Nieuwoudt said: \"We are urging doctors to vote yes to strike action. \"By voting yes they will be telling the government there is no alternative to fixing pay – this cannot wait for different fiscal circumstances and a healthier NHS. The answer is to fix it today.\" The vote on industrial action runs until 7 July. Streeting said his door was always open but added there was no more money to increase salaries above the latest award. And he said a fresh bout of strikes would put attempts to rebuild the NHS at risk. Speaking to the BBC, Streeting said: \" I don't think strikes are in their interests, in patients interests and I certainly don't think it's in the interest of the NHS overall.\" Streeting has often cited the deal he reached last year to end the previous round of strikes as evidence of the government's ability to reform the health service and cut waiting lists. Meanwhile, BMA sources said consultants were likely to start a dispute process over their 4% rise - the first step towards moving to an industrial action ballot. Other staff including nurses, midwives and physios have been given a 3.6% increase. The Royal College of Nursing said it was \"grotesque\" nurses were getting less than doctors for the second year in a row. The Scottish government has agreed a deal worth 8% over two years with health unions representing all staff apart from doctors and dentists.  There have been no strikes by health workers in Scotland. Mammography will launch first, followed by ultrasound, respiratory and cardiology services. Jasmine Wheaton and Matt Snook lost their twin babies shortly after their birth last year. The person was given clozapine for schizophrenia while being monitored remotely. Lisa Wheelhouse has been working at the George Eliot Hospital in Nuneaton since 1989. The plans would allow people in acute mental distress to get treatment in hospital while also reducing A&E wait times.",

    "title": "Chinese-owned Volvo Cars to cut 3,000 jobs",
    "article_text": "Sweden-based car maker Volvo Cars says it will cut around 3,000 jobs as part of its cost-cutting measures. The firm says the layoffs will mainly impact office-based positions in Sweden, representing about 15% of its white collar workforce. Last month, Volvo Cars, which is owned by Chinese group Geely Holding, announced an 18 billion Swedish kronor ($1.9bn; £1.4bn) \"action plan\" shake-up of the business. The global motor industry is facing a number of major challenges including US President Donald Trump's 25% tariffs on imported cars, higher cost of materials and slower sales in Europe. The chief executive of Volvo Cars, Håkan Samuelsson, pointed to the \"challenging period\" faced by the industry as a reason for the layoffs. \"The actions announced today have been difficult decisions, but they are important steps as we build a stronger and even more resilient Volvo Cars,\"he said in a statement. Earlier this month,the firm saidits global sales for April fell by 11% compared to the same period last year. Volvo Cars has its main headquarters and development offices in Gothenburg, Sweden. It has major production plants  in Sweden, Belgium, China and the US. The company was sold by US motor industry giant Ford to China's Geely in 2010. In 2021, Volvo said all of its cars would go electric by 2030. Last year it scaled back that ambition due to a number of issues including \"additional uncertainties created by recent tariffs on EVs in various markets\". Japanese car makerNissan said earlier this month that it will cut another 11,000 jobs globallyand shut seven factories as it shakes up the business in the face of weak sales. Falling sales in China and heavy discounting in the US, its two biggest markets, have taken a heavy toll on earnings, while a proposed merger with Honda and Mitsubishi collapsed in February. The latest cutbacks brought the total number of layoffs announced by the company in the past year to about 20,000, or 15% of its workforce. In an example of the cutthroat rivalry between carmakers, Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD announced at the weekend that it would cut the prices of more than 20 of its models. The move brings the price of its cheapest car, the Seagull EV, to as low as 55,800 yuan ($7,745; £5,700). In response Chinese government-owned Changan and Leapmotor, which is backed by Chrysler owner Stellantis, announced their own price cuts. Shares in Chinese car makers fell sharply after those announcements. In April, BYD outsold Elon Musk's Tesla in Europe for the first time, according to car industry research firm Jato Dynamics. Lotus worker Sheena Valentina hopes one day, the industry will be equal for everyone. Califormia's plan was expected to have significant influence over the wider car industry in the US. The previous government had said autonomous vehicles were \"set to be on the road\" by 2026. Nissan announced this week that it would lay off another 11,000 workers and shut seven factories. The comment came after the company's boss refused to rule out opening production plants in America.",

    "article_text": "The word \"horror\" is used by almost all of the papers to describe what happened on Monday evening when a car ploughed into crowds during Liverpool FC's Premier League victory parade. The Guardian says the celebrations\"plunged into chaos\", as jubilant scenes were replaced by \"fear and confusion\". The Daily Mirror notes that families had been thereto enjoy the team's successbefore a \"day of joy\" turned into one of terror. The Daily Mail's headline is\"Carnage at the parade\". The front page of The Times hasdetailed accounts from witnesses. One man says he heard a \"pop, pop, pop\" which was the sound of people being knocked off the bonnet of the vehicle. Another person says they saw the car \"plough through\" the street hitting people. The Daily Telegraph says the car sped through Water Street in Liverpool's city centre for around 200 yards before coming to a halt. It reports on\"angry fans\" surrounding the vehicle, smashing the back window. The i Paper reports that police were quick to publish details ofthe arrest of a 53-year-old white, British manin connection with the incident. The paper says this was to \"avoid speculation\", after past accusations that officers were too slow to pass on information to the public after incidents such as last year's stabbings in Southport. In other news, the Guardian highlightsa letter to Sir Keir Starmerfrom more than 800 leading lawyers urging the UK to put sanctions on Israel. One of the signatories, Professor Guy Goodwin-Gill of Oxford University, is quoted as saying \"now is the time for the UK to show its commitment to the rule of law\". And despite rumours of a comeback, The Telegraph reports that Conservative MPs saythey do not want Boris Johnsonto return as the Tory leader. Senior figures have apparently said the political landscape has changed and there is no \"appetite\" for such a move. One shadow cabinet minister tells the paper they cannot think of a \"single one\" of their colleagues who thinks Johnson returning to the Conservative Party would be a good thing.

    "title": "Japan introduces rules to put outlandish baby names to bed",
    "article_text": "Parents inJapanwill no longer have free rein over the names they give their children, after the introduction this week of new rules on the pronunciation ofkanjicharacters. The change is designed to halt the use ofkirakira(shiny or glittery) names that have proliferated among parents hoping to add a creative flourish to their children’s names – creating administrative headaches for local authorities and, in some cases, inviting derision from classmates. While the revisions to the family registry act do not ban kanji – Chinese-based characters in written Japanese –parents are required to inform local authorities of their phonetic reading, in an attempt to banish unusual or controversial pronunciations. Now, only officially recognised renderings of kanji characters will be permitted, as the government seeks to end the confusion outlandish names can cause in schools, hospitals and other public services. The debate overkirakiranames has been raging since the 1990s, prompted by the rise in monikers based on unorthodox readings of kanji. The government has described the emphasis on standard pronunciations as a way of simplifying the digitalisation of administrative procedures, but it is also being seen as an attempt to slow the spread of quirky – and to many, unfathomable – given names. Parents have been criticised for naming their children after famous characters or brands: Pikachu, of Pokémon fame, Naiki (Nike), Daiya (Diamond), Pū (as in Winnie-the-Pooh) and Kitty, after the fictional feline Kitty Chan. Others have made headlines for their supposed impudence – Ōjisama (Prince) and Akuma (Devil). Seiko Hashimoto, a former Olympic speed skater and track cyclist who later headed theTokyo 2020 organising committee, caused a stir when she named her sons Girishia (Greece) and Torino (Turin), because they were born the year the summer and winter Olympics were held in those locations. Having selected the kanji herself, Hashimoto knew how to pronounce them, but others would have been left scratching their heads. Parents have defended their choices as a show of individual flair in a society where the pressure to conform can be overwhelming, particularly when it comes to raising children. While most of the 3,000 or so kanji permitted by the revised law have multiple conventional readings, some characters have the linguistic flexibility to accommodate more bizarre phonetics. Shock factor aside, officials have complained that – at first sight – many are simply unpronounceable. Now, parents who have selected pronunciations that clearly deviate from convention will be asked to explain their choice of name in writing and, if necessary, come up with an acceptable alternative. While media reports suggest only the most egregious examples will be rejected, the phonetic requirement is a rare change to Japan’s family register, orkoseki– a legal record that lists the names and dates of birth of the head of the household, their spouse and their children.",

InTasmania, six Senate seats have been won by two Labor senators (Carol Brown and Richard Dowling), two Liberals (Claire Chandler and Richard Colbeck) and the Greens’ Nick McKim, as well as Lambie. Lee Hanson, the daughter of the One Nation founder Pauline, was unsuccessful in her attempt to win a Senate seat in Tasmania. “I am very grateful that the Tasmanian people have given me the chance to fight for them for another six years,” Lambie wrote in an email thanking supporters after the result was confirmed. “Representing Tasmania and bringing the voices and concerns of the people to Canberra, is what gets me out of bed in the morning! Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email “My focus is on the Tasmanian people, especially those doing it tough. Interest rates are coming down and that’s good, but for many Tasmanian families it will barely touch the sides.” In a post on social media, the Jacqui Lambie Network – the senator’s political party – also thanked voters. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion “Campaigns are tough, but your energy, belief in fairness, and commitment to keeping Canberra honest kept us going every day,” the post said. “This campaign has been powered by everyday Aussies who want a bit of honesty, fairness, and common sense back in politics.” Tuesday’s results came after the AEC on Mondaydeclared senators for the state of South Australia– the first confirmed results in the upper house. The Labor senators Marielle Smith and Karen Grogan have returned to parliament, along with the Liberals Alex Antic and Anne Ruston, and the Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young; Labor also won the last spot, with 21-year-old Charlotte Walker to join the parliament. Results from Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory are expected on Wednesday, with Western Australia on Thursday, and New South Wales and Queensland to follow either on Friday or early next week. The AEC has been conducting complex counts and recounts in the seats of Calwell, Bradfield and Goldstein; Calwell was on Monday finally called for Labor while recounts in the other two seats continue. In the Senate, Labor is expected to be able to pass legislation with only the help of the Greens or theCoalitionin this term, and is not likely to require the help of crossbenchers including Lambie or David Pocock, who were influential in the previous parliament. The former Greens leader Adam Bandt, who unexpectedly lost his own seat of Melbourne, hadurged the government to deal with the Greens in the Senateto enact “an era of progressive change in the parliament”. Pending further results, Labor could end up with between 28 and 30 Senate seats, with the Greens on 11, and the Coalition on 27. The Coalition has lost one Senate seat in South Australia, and could lose a further seat in each of NSW, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia. Price, re-elected in the NT, is among those likely to receive a Coalition frontbench position when the combined Liberal-National shadow ministry is announced this week. Her decision to switch allegiances, and sit in the Liberal party room rather than with the Nationals, wasamong factors which helped spark last week’s Coalition divorce.",

    "article_text": "Follow today’s news live Get ourbreaking news email,free appordaily news podcast TheNew South Walespolice commissioner,Karen Webb, has been cleared of a misconduct allegation by the state watchdog. The Law Enforcement Conduct Commission said it received a complaint over an allegation Webb had breached police force policy by sharing the confidential details of a deceased person with broadcasterRay Hadleyof 2GB Radio in April 2024 before their next of kin was notified. The commission conducted a preliminary investigation and “undertook a range of investigative strategies” and concluded its effort in March 2025, satisfied that there was no misconduct by Webb. Webb earlier this month announced she would resign after three years in the five-year role and 38 years in the police force.

Bishop, 17, has not been seen since she was driven to Bundaberg airport at about 8.30am on 15 May. She never entered the terminal to check in for her flight. Investigators have been searching the national park this week and have seized several items in the search for Bishop. It’s unclear what those items are or how they are linked to the search, but officials said they were undergoing forensic examination. Those appeals include any information or footage of a silver or grey Hyundai ix35 gathered between 15 May and 18 May. The vehicle is thought to be the car used to take Bishop to the airport. Police seized and searched the vehicle after treating it as a crime scene. It has since been released. Australian women lagging on use of IUDs due to education ‘failure’, experts say An exclusive report you may have missed from earlier today: most Australian women don’t know that intrauterine devices are the mosteffective form of contraception. Experts say this nationwide “failure in public education” has contributed to low uptake and caused Australia to lag behind other western countries. The latest Jean Hailes National Women’sHealthSurvey of 3,537 reproductive age women found more than 80% of 18-to-24-year-olds and 60% of 25-to-44-year-olds want to avoid getting pregnant. The survey found only 7% of women aged 18 to 24 and 11% of women aged 25 to 44 reported using an IUD. The CEO of Jean Hailes, DrSarah White, said the results show Australia is “far behind” equivalent countries such as the UK, South Korea, France and the US. InSwedenandEnglandrates of use are over 30%. White said: They’re walking past one of the best options they’ve got because they just don’t know about it. IUDs are small devices implanted in the uterus. As a form of long-acting reversible contraceptives, they are themost effectiveway to prevent pregnancy (over 99%).

Energy Safe Victoria said it was investigating the incident after one resident was left with significant burns to their feet and legs and another suffered smoke inhalation. There were at least three e-scooters and e-bikes inside the property, including one connected to an incompatible charger identified as the cause of the fire after firefighters extinguished the 12th-storey blaze in the early morning last Tuesday. Energy Safe Victoria CEO Leanne Hughson said chargers that didn’t match the lithium-ion batteries in e-rides could overcharge the battery and cause thermal runaway, sparking fires. She said: While thankfully no one was seriously injured in this incident, it is a timely reminder of just how quickly a house fire can ignite when owners use incompatible battery chargers for their e-rides. Blazes sparked by lithium batteries saw the New South Wales governmentmove to regulatethe devices’ handling and disposal in March. You can read more about the risk here, as explained by Guardian Australia’sDonna Lu: Greens demand new regulation of shark control programs The Greens have drawn a red line in potential negotiations for new Albanese government efforts to reform Australia’s environmental laws, demanding new regulation of shark control programs. Guardian Australia has reported the forthcoming federal law reforms could hold up Queensland government’s expanded lethal shark control program, which last year killed dozens of whales, dolphins, turtles and rays. You can read more here: The program has a partial exemption from the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, designed to protect threatened species, and the Greens have demanded this exemption be removed. SenatorPeter Whish-Wilsonsaid shark nets and drumlines should be removed from Queensland, not expanded, calling them “weapons of mass destruction to precious marine wildlife”. He said in a statement: The Greens call on the federal government to reject any exemption sought for this expanded shark cull program, and use its upcoming commitment to reform Australia’s environmental laws to remove existing exemptions to state-controlled lethal shark net programs that risk federally protected species.Make no mistake, the Greens will be putting this on the table in environment law negotiations. The Queensland government expansion would pump $88m over four years into the state’s shark management plan, which would see shark nets and baited drum lines rolled out at more beaches, as well as the expanded use of non-lethal technology such as drone surveillance. Healing Foundation welcomes WA redress scheme for Stolen Generations survivors The Healing Foundation, a peak body that supports survivors of Stolen Generations survivors and their families have welcomed the WA government’s redress scheme announcement saying the scheme is long overdue after decades of campaigning. The Healing Foundation’s CEO and Yawuru womanShannan Dodsonsaid she felt an overwhelming mixture of emotions for WA Stolen Generations survivors and their families. Dodson said in a statement: Across Western Australia, survivors and descendants have been fighting tirelessly for years for justice and redress. I pay tribute and honour all the Stolen Generations organisations that have advocated and stood alongside survivors throughout this long journey … No amount of money will make up for the trauma inflicted on Stolen children, but redress is validation of their experience, and some compensation for the pain they’ve suffered. WA survivor and co-chair of Bringing Them Home WA,Tony Hansen,said the redress scheme and WA governments must acknowledge its “brutal history”: And evil policies that ripped the hearts out of children and families, this day will go down in history as a powerful moment of truth-telling. The Cook government today announced its redress scheme of $85,000 for living survivors of the Stolen Generations in Western Australia in recognition of the trauma and harm that state and federal governments caused through forced child removals from Aboriginal families. WA to provide redress scheme for survivors of Stolen Generations Western Australia will provide a support scheme for Aboriginal people removed from their families as children under Stolen Generations policies, leaving Queensland the only Australian jurisdiction yet to offer financial redress. The premier,Roger Cook,today opened the financial support scheme, which would make payments of up to $85,000 to be delivered to eligible applicants late this year. Those who were taken from their families before July 1972 or, if they have passed, family members applying on their behalf, would be eligible. Announcing the payments, Cook told reporters: Today, we take small steps towards righting an historic wrong … These payments acknowledge an injustice. It does not correct what has happened … It’s no doubt that it’s overdue. We want to make sure that we take deliberate steps in righting the wrongs of the path and providing a pathway of healing into the future. Invasive species group not happy with calls for bounties for feral pests The Invasive Species Council, an independent environmental advocacy group, is not happy after the NSW premier,Chris Minns, suggested the state would look into imposing bounties for the hunting of feral pigs, goats and cats earlier today. The group claimed Minns’ comments have “nothing to do with good feral animal management”, instead pointing to the need for “serious, coordinated programs led by professionals”. The group’s CEO,Jack Gough, said in a statement: Bounty hunters might be heroes on the big screen, but in the real world of feral animal control, they’re just a waste of taxpayers’ money. The CSIRO’s current advice on pest management says bounties rarely work to help bring numbers down. Read more here: Bounties back in vogue to cull feral goats, cats and pigs TheNew South Walespremier has thrown his weight behind paying bounty hunters to help reduce feral cats, goats and pigs roaming his state,AAPreports. Bounty hunters may be unleashed on feral cats and goats for the first time in years as a state government looks to “novel” ways to deal with pests. Chris Minnssaid the state has to do better to control feral pest populations. He told Triple M Coffs Coast radio: It’s about time we start thinking about novel ways of reducing the feral goat, the feral pig, the feral cat population, which has really taken over a lot of parks … We should be open to bounties and other things, because we’ve got a lot of recreational shooters out there that are actually getting rid of a lot of the pests roaming across our native vegetation. We can be doing far better on it. The Victorian government offered fox hunters $10 to $14 per scalp in 2022, which saw more than 80,000 of the species wiped out that year. Nearly $1bn is also being spent on prevention and protection against biosecurity threats in NSW. Invasive species are the highest impact contributors of extinctions, directly endangering 70% of threatened wildlife and ecosystems in the state. The premier highlighted the success of brumby culls in the Kosciuszko national park, bringing the population down up to 80%, but his suggestion has attracted criticism – more on that in a minute. Fines top $30 million after college misled students An online diploma college has been slapped with $30 million in fines after using dodgy practices to enrol disadvantaged students in courses they never logged into,AAPreports. The penalties follow a Federal Court ruling that Captain Cook College attempted to maximise its profits by making false representations to potential students from September 2015. The college was acquired by parent company, Site Group International Limited, in 2014 before it was closed at the end of 2016. Site Group and chief operations officer Blake Wills were also found to be aware of, and involved in, the conduct, the court found. Justice Angus Stewart on Tuesday ordered the trio to pay more than $30 million for its actions. Wills was ordered to contribute $400,000 for his involvement and was banned from managing corporations for three years. Legal action was first brought against the college in November 2018 by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.The watchdog alleged there was clear evidence the college enrolled vulnerable students in courses they were unlikely to complete.More than 90 per cent of the students did not complete their online course, and about 85 per cent of them never logged into their course, the watchdog said.Courses included business, project management and human resource management.More than 6000 affected students accrued more than $50 million in VET FEE-HELP loans, a government program assisting students to pay their tuition fees. In July 2021, the Federal Court found that the college and Site engaged in a system of unconscionable conduct.Captain Cook College, Site Group and Mr Wills appealed to the High Court following the ruling, but the findings were upheld in August 2024.The trio were ordered to pay the watchdog’s legal costs for the court proceedings.Captain Cook College was established in 1998 as a provider of online VET FEE-HELP diploma courses. ATO whistleblower Richard Boyle hailed as ‘superhero’ after striking plea deal WhistleblowerRichard Boylehas been hailed a “superhero” after striking a plea deal under which he may avoid jail,AAPreports. The 49-year-old has admitted to four criminal charges linked to his exposure of unethical debt recovery practices at the Australian Taxation Office. Boyle appeared in the Adelaide district court on Tuesday, where he pleaded guilty to disclosing protected information to another entity, making a record of protected information, using a listening device to record a private conversation and recording other people’s tax file numbers. The commonwealth director of public prosecutions withdrew a further 15 charges, while another five charges were dropped in March.Outside court, Whistleblowers Justice Fund founderRex Patricksaid Boyle had “pleaded guilty to helping all Australians by disclosing poor conduct by the tax office, who were stripping funds from businesses who were in distress”. He said: He should be wearing a big S on his chest, as a superhero, instead of a conviction … The message being sent by the government is: if you blow the whistle, we will pursue you to the end. Boyle, a former ATO debt collection officer, raised concerns internally about debt recovery practices in October 2017, when he grew worried about operations in the tax office.Believing his complaints had been ignored, he went public on the ABC’s Four Corners about the tactics used against taxpayers who owed the ATO money.Outside court, Boyle hugged supporters, including his wife, Louise Beaston. Last year, the SA court of appeal ruled Boyle was not protected by federal whistleblowing laws – because the charges related not to his whistleblowing, but steps Boyle had taken in preparation to blow the whistle internally, including taking photos of documents and recording conversations.

    "title": "Sydney dust storm: some residents advised to stay inside due to ‘extremely poor’ air quality",
    "article_text": "Parts ofSydneyfaced “extremely poor” air quality warnings on Tuesday morning as a dust storm swept eastwards from inland Australia. Sydney’s north-west and central west including Parramatta had the heaviest air pollution, with very poor air quality also observed across Sydney stretching as far south as Goulburn and as far north as Muswellbrook, according toofficial pollution monitoring stations. Those sensitive to air pollution were advised to stay indoors and close windows and doors until air quality improved, or to travel to places with air conditioning if preferred to their homes, the state government said, as a “dust storm sweeping across NSW is impacting air quality across the state”. The government warned there were high levels of PM10 particles, a common feature of bushfire smoke or dust storms.PM10 particleshave a diameter of 10 micrometres or less and are small enough to pass through the throat and nose and enter the lungs. Once inhaled, these particles can affect the heart and lungs and cause serious health effects. Even those without particular sensitivities were advised to avoid outdoor physical activity if they develop symptoms such as coughing or a shortness of breath, and when indoors, to close windows and doors. The dust storm has travelled from South Australia, where it hit the town of Orroroo on Monday, blocking out the sky and covering the area in an orange haze. It also blanketed areas of regional Victoria on Monday afternoon, including Mildura in the state’s north-west. The dust storms and haze affecting Australia’s south-east were forecast to clear in the afternoon, the Bureau of Meteorology said. Dean Narramore, a bureau meteorologist, said south-westerly winds would clear out the dust haze affecting Sydney and surrounds in the next few hours. “It’s just lingering on the east coast in the next couple of hours, and then it’s going to be all gone by this afternoon,” he said. Dust also swept through Melbourne, Canberra and surrounding regions early Tuesday morning after strong winds kicked up a haze out of drought-affected areas in South Australia and Victoria’s west, Narramore said. He said those conditions have since eased but heavy and possibly damaging winds are still set to impact parts of south-west NSW. The BoM said dry conditions and strong winds caused the large dust clouds to form, leading to poor visibility and bad driving conditions that prompted some road closures. This article was amended on 27 May 2025. An earlier version incorrectly stated that the dust storm had blown in to Sydney from the east.",

    "article_text": "Haider* hid in the attic as gunmen rifled through his cousins’ belongings. “Is anyone upstairs? Don’t come down or I will kill you!” yelled a masked man wearing military fatigues. Haider waited in silence for an hour before fleeing his cousins’ house in the village of al-Sanobar on Syria’s coast. He emerged to find his home ablaze and 11 members of his family shot dead, including his 22-year-old brother and 16-year-old cousin. His family were some of the more than 200 al-Sanobar residentskilled in sectarian massacresin north-west Syria on 7 March which mostly targeted members of the minority Alawite religion, a sect of Islam. The massacres were prompted by a coordinated attack on Syrian government forces by fighters loyal to the ousted president Bashar al-Assad. After coming under attack, the government issued a call for help. Fighters and armed individualsdescended on the Syrian coastwhere a bloodletting ensued, mostly against members of the Alawite sect to which the Assad family belong. By the end, more than 1,100 people were dead. Unlike most of the victims’ families, Haider knows who killed his loved ones. The gunmen, who appeared to be pro-government fighters, filmed themselves trampling through his cousins’ home, singing and yelling “ethnic cleansing!” joyfully, before uploading the video to Facebook, as first revealed by aCNN investigation. A spokesperson for Syria’s interior ministry told the Guardian the men in the video had been arrested, but at least one of the gunmen remains active on Facebook, posting as recently as Tuesday. Haider, 25, said he was scared his family’s killers were still out there, leaving him in constant fear. “There’s no security at all, we are suffering. I’m dying a thousand deaths a day,” he said over the phone. Syria’s president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, the former leader of the Islamist rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS),has set up a fact-finding committeeto investigate how the sectarian massacres unfolded, vowing that “no one would be above the law”. The results of the investigation and how the government holds perpetrators accountable is seen as a crucial test for the new authorities in Syria, who have pledged to protect religious minorities. The committee, initially meant to deliver its report in early April, was granted an additional three months after it requested more time. The lack of answers over how the killings happened and who was responsible has left victims’ families feeling robbed of justice. “They said that after a month everyone would be held accountable. But so far nothing has happened. I just want security, and to finish with this issue of ‘ethnic cleansing’,” Haider said. A source close to the committee has said that while they understand the political pressure to give answers to grieving families, a proper investigation could take “years”. They pointed to the UN special tribunal for Lebanon, which took 15 years to issue its verdict on the killing of the Lebanese prime minister Rafic Hariri, as an example of the difficulty of fact-finding missions. Complicating the committee’s work is a deluge of fake pictures and videos which show horrific crimes from the civil war rather than the killings on Syria’s coast. Witnesses have had trouble distinguishing who exactly committed violence against them and their families. After 14 years of war, Syria is populated by dozens of militias, many of which do not wear uniforms that civilians could easily identify. Human rights groups, such as the Syrian Network for Human Rights,have pointed toTurkish-backed militias, such as the Sultan Suleiman Shah brigade, as being responsible for most of the killings of almost 900 civilians by pro-government forces on the coast. Alawite civilians from two different villages in north-west Syria whose family members were killed told the Guardian they were attacked by members of the brigade. The Guardian could not independently verify their claims. The militia’s leader, Mohammed al-Jassem, more commonly known by his nom du guerre, Abu Amsha, denied that his group harmed any civilians and said they refused to enter deep into the Syrian coast once they saw abuses happening. “Our job was to clear the highway and return to Beit Yashout [a village on the coast]. Every village that we entered, they thanked us for the good treatment,” Abu Amsha told the Guardian while flanked by his senior officers at a militia headquarters in Afrin, northern Syria. He then showed a slideshow of civilians being filmed thanking him personally, as well as a series of WhatsApp voice-notes that Alawite civilians sent praising the militia. He said that after an internal review, he had found that none of his 16,000 members had committed any abuses on the coast. Abu Amsha and his militia weresanctionedby the US in 2023 for alleged human rights abuses, including the kidnapping and mass extortion of civilians in areas living under their control. “All of my officers have certificates in international humanitarian law,” Abu Amsha said, pulling up a picture of his officers attending human rights training by the Swiss NGO Geneva Call. The source close to the fact-finding committee said it was still unclear if militia members or individuals were responsible for most of the killings. Many of the armed individuals who killed civilians were not neighbours turning on one another, but people who came from surrounding areas after receiving phone calls from besieged members of Syrian general security. While the promise of justice remains far off, the indignities suffered by victims grow greater. Fadi* asked some relatives to check on his home after he fled to Lebanon to escape a massacre that killed 25 of his neighboursin the Alawite village of Arza, north Syria. When Fadi’s relatives knocked on the door, a family from the neighbouring village answered. “The funniest thing is, they didn’t just take my house. They were also wearing my clothes and my children’s clothes. I’m not sure whether to laugh or cry,” he said. * Names have been changed",

    "title": "US-backed aid group says Gaza operations have begun a day after its director resigned",
    "article_text": "A US-backed foundation tasked with supplying aid toGazasaid it had begun operations on Monday, delivering truckloads of food to designated distribution sites a day after its executive director resigned because the operation could not fulfil its mission in a way that adhered to “humanitarian principles”. The aid plan,which has been endorsed by Israel but rejected by the UN, unfolded amid uncertainty about whether any assistance had actually reached civilians. Palestinians reported no sign of aid deliveries earlier on Monday, but the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) later said truckloads of food – it did not say how many – had been delivered to its hubs, and distribution had begun. It was not clear where the hubs were located or how those receiving supplies were chosen. “More trucks with aid will be delivered tomorrow, with the flow of aid increasing each day,” it said in a statement. The GHF is taking over the handling of aid despite objections from the United Nations. The desperately needed supplies started flowing on a day that sawIsraeli strikes kill at least 52 people in Gaza.The UN and aid groups have pushed back against the new system. They say that Israel is trying to use food as a weapon and that a new system won’t be effective.Israel has pushed for an alternative aid delivery plan because it says it must stop Hamas from seizing aid. The UN has denied that the militant group has diverted large amounts.On Sundaythe GHF’s head, Jake Wood, resigned, saying it had become clear the foundation would not be allowed to operate independently. In a statement he said, it was “not possible to implement this plan while also strictly adhering to the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence, which I will not abandon”. The organisation appointed an interim leader, John Acree, to replace Wood,The organisation is made up of former humanitarian, government and military officials. It has said its distribution points will be guarded by private security firms and that the aid would reach a million Palestinians – around half of Gaza’s population – by the end of the week. The new operation will rely on four major distribution centres in southern Gaza that will screen families for involvement with Hamas militants, potentially using facial recognition or biometric technology, according to aid officials. But many details of how the operation will work remain unexplained, and it was not immediately clear whether aid groups that have refused to cooperate with the foundation would still be able to send in trucks. Hamas condemned the new system, saying it would “replace order with chaos, enforce a policy of engineered starvation of Palestinian civilians, and use food as a weapon during wartime.“ With foodcritically short after a nearly three-month blockade, Israel has faced a mounting international outcry this, including from western allies, as it launched a new offensive in Gaza, already largely destroyed by Israeli bombardment and where the population of 2 million is at risk of famine. Under international pressure,Israelbegan allowing a trickle of humanitarian aid into Gaza last week. Close ally Germany said Israel’s recent attacks in Gaza were inflicting a toll on civilians that could no longer be justified as a fight against Hamas, which ignited the war with its cross-border 7 October 2023, attack on Israel. In Gaza City, medics said 30 Palestinians, including displaced women and children who were seeking shelter in a school, were killed in an airstrike on Monday. Images shared widely on social media showed what appeared to be badly burned bodies being pulled from the rubble. Israel’s military confirmed it had targeted the school. It said the building was being used as a centre by Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants to plan and organise attacks. Israel’s military said it used precise weapons, surveillance and other steps to mitigate the risk of harming civilians. It did not provide evidence that the school was being used by militants. Another strike on a house in Jabalia, adjacent to Gaza City, killed at least 15 other people, medics said. The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report",

    "title": "Tough times loom for night-time economy as young Britons opt to go out (and go home) early",
    "article_text": "A social media and a home delivery boom has shifted younger people’s attitude to going out and risks shrinking the late night entertainment market, the boss of one of the UK’s biggest pub companies has warned. Phil Urban, the chief executive of the pub operator Mitchells & Butlers, said that the “toughest part of the market right now is late night” as younger people abandon the traditions of previous generations, who would be more inclined to “go out late night and stay out”. “I think social media means that you don’t have to do that to stay in touch with your friends,” he said. “People are often meeting beforehand to have something to eat, having a few drinks at home, before going out. So, those pure late-night, club operators, have certainly got a smaller market.” He added: “We wouldn’t go back into that sort of club market, it’s not for us, because I do think it’s going to take a long while to reverse – if it does.” In 2013, the UK had 1,700 nightclubs. By June 2024 there were fewer than half as many, just 787,according to figures from the analysts CGA by NIQ and AlixPartners. The Covid-19 pandemic, which effectively shut down the industry for months on end, sped up the pace of decline, putting paid to more than a third of Britain’s clubs, the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) has said. Mitchells owns restaurants, pubs and bar chains including Toby Carvery, Harvester, All Bar One, Nicholson’s, and Miller & Carter. Urban added that the group’s brands were “doing well”, but that its Irish pub and bar chain O’Neill’s was “probably having the toughest time” due to its exposure to the night-time industry. While hospitality companies will be hoping for a boost in spending over the bank holiday weekend, family-focused events such as Mother’s Day and Easter have been the driving force behind a jump in visitors for many chains.

    "title": "Starmer says ‘whole country stands with Liverpool’ - as it happened",
    "article_text": "This blog is now closed. See our full report here:Dozens injured as car ploughs into crowd at Liverpool FC victory parade This blog is coming to a close. Here’s a roundup of this evening’s events: Forty-seven people were injured, including two critically, when acar ploughed into fans at Liverpool FC’s Premier League victory parade. Four children were among those hurt, including one child with serious injuries. The incident is not being treated as terror-related, authorities said. A 53-year-old white British man, who is believed to be the driver of the car, has been arrested. Police said they were not currently looking for anyone else in relation to the incident. Fire crews said they removed three adults and a child who were trapped under a vehicle. Twenty-seven people were taken to hospital and 20 treated at the scene, the North West ambulance service said. Prime ministerKeir Starmersaid the scenes were appalling and thanked police and emergency services for their “swift and ongoing response to this shocking incident”. Home secretaryYvette Coopercalled the incident “shocking and horrendous”. Liam Robinson, leader of Liverpool city council, said the incident “has cast a very dark shadow of what had been a joyous day for the city and the finale to a fabulous bank holiday weekend”. Liverpool FC said it was in contact with police and “our thoughts and prayers are with those” affected. Here is our full story: More from witnesses here: people packed on to the street to watch the Liverpool FC parade were only alerted to the danger by screams from the crowd, one said. The woman, who gave her name asChelsea, told BBC Radio that enabled some people to jump out of the way as the driver showed no sign of slowing. “With the commotion, that was the only reason we looked up, and thankfully, looked up and managed to jump out [of] the way in time,” she said. Reuters also reports another witness as saying before the incident that there was disorder in the city centre where the parade was due to pass, with overcrowding and spectators confused by a lack of signage about street closures or where they should go. Liverpool last won the trophy during the Covid pandemic when celebrations were not permitted due to lockdowns. Politicians in Britain and in Ireland, where the club is popular, thanked emergency services. “My thoughts are with all those injured or affected,”Keir Starmer, the prime minister, said on X, calling the scenes appalling and saying he was being updated. Liverpool FC said on X it was in direct contact with police: Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have been affected by this serious incident. Just to recap, with most people off work for the spring bank holiday, hundreds of thousands of fans had gathered to watch the Liverpool team and its staff travel through the city centre on an open-top bus with the Premier League trophy. Videos on social media showed people thrown into the air as the car rammed into spectators, Reuters reports. When the car stopped, angry fans converged on it and began smashing the windows as police officers intervened to prevent them from reaching the driver. In the aftermath, emergency services were seen carrying victims on stretchers to ambulances and debris scattered on the road. The incident “cast a very dark shadow over what had been a joyous day”, Liverpool city council leaderLiam Robinsonsaid on social media. Police were unusually quick to give a description of the man they arrested.Dal Babu, a former chief superintendent in London’s Metropolitan Police, told the BBC this was an effort to cool social media speculation that the episode was an Islamist attack. The same police force oversaw the response to the murder of three young girls in the nearby town of Southport last year, an incident which sparked days of rioting, sparked by speculation online over the identity of the attacker. The former Labour shadow chancellorJohn McDonnellhas expressed his solidarity with the people of Liverpool. The independent MPposted on X: It’s hard to put into words our feelings about the terrible events in Liverpool today. For a wonderful day of joy to be turned into one of horror is an absolute tragedy. All of those hurt are in my thoughts. As always Liverpool will stand together in solidarity. YNWA The independent MPApsana Begumhas hailed Liverpudlians’ “exceptional strength” in times of adversity. She tweetedthat she was thinking of all those affected by what happened, also saying on X: The people of Liverpool have always demonstrated exceptional strength and unity in times of adversity. We stand with you in solidarity. In fresh comments reported by Press Association, the prime minister,Keir Starmer, has said “the whole country stands with Liverpool”. He said: Tonight, I have spoken to [Liverpool mayor]Steve Rotheramabout the terrible events in Liverpool and the remarkable bravery shown by the police and other emergency services. They are supporting and caring for those injured in these terrible events. Everyone, especially children, should be able to celebrate their heroes without this horror. The city has a long and proud history of coming together through difficult times. Liverpool stands together and the whole country stands with Liverpool.” Former Liverpool manager SirKenny Dalglish, who was at the parade, has said he is “shocked, horrified and deeply saddened about what happened at the end of the parade today.” In a post on X he said: Our anthem has never felt more appropriate, You’ll never walk alone. Your Liverpool family are behind you. Everton, Liverpool’s Merseyside rivals, have said “Our thoughts are with all those who have been affected by this serious incident in our city.” Paddy Edrich, a reporter with the Liverpool Echo, has shared this image of the aftermath: A final look at Water Street after an unimaginably horrifying end to what was until then a perfect celebration. We’ll be back at the scene early tomorrow morning to bring you more updates.pic.twitter.com/hs9WhZlVsv Andy Hunter, our Merseyside football correspondent, has written about how a day of celebration turned into one of horror. The Strand had been a scene of sheer euphoria 25 minutes earlier. At 5.41pm the open-top bus parading the Liverpool team had passed by the Royal Liver Building and a huge crowd broke into a powerful rendition of You’ll Never Walk Alone to celebrate the new Premier League champions. Fireworks and ticker-tape exploded overhead. From an apartment on Mann Island, former Liverpool managers Jürgen Klopp and Sir Kenny Dalglish waved to jubilant supporters below. Just after 6pm, on nearby Water Street, the scene was one of devastation. A car, driven by a 53-year-old white British male from the Liverpool area, collided with a number of pedestrians including four children. Twenty-seven people were taken to hospital, with two sustaining serious injuries, including one of the children. Another 20 were treated for minor injuries at the scene and others self-presented at hospitals on Merseyside later in the day. Ambulances were parked outside Liverpool town hall over three hours later. Approximately 20 to 30 casualties were being treated in the Riva Italian restaurant across the road. One man from Birmingham, who asked not to be named, had been treated for back and leg injuries having been knocked over in the incident. Our north of England editor,Josh Halliday, was at the press conference tonight, here is his write-up: Four children were injured, including one critically, when a car ploughed into fans at a Liverpool football victory parade in an incident not being treated as terror-related, authorities said. One of the children suffered “major injuries” in the “horrific” collision that caused dozens of casualties just after 6pm on Monday. At a press conference in the Cunard building in Liverpool on Monday might, North West ambulance service (NWAS) said 27 patients were taken to hospitals around the city – including two who sustained major injuries. One of those is a child. NWAS said 20 other people were treated for injuries at the scene and that other people were still arriving at hospital seeking treatment. Jenny Sims, the assistant chief constable of Merseyside police, urged people not to share misinformation about the incident and said it was not being treated as terror-related. She said: “What I can tell you is that we believe this to be an isolated incident and we are not currently looking for anyone else in connection with it. The incident is not being treated as terrorism.” The press conference has come to an end.Simmssaid the incident is not being treated as terrorism and that police are not currently looking for anybody else in relation to it. Kitchensaid four of the people injured were children. He said 20 people were treated for minor injuries at the scene and 27 were taken to hospital. Two of them, including one child, are thought to have sustained serious injuries. No fatalities have been reported. Shadow home secretaryChris Philphas also commented on the incident. He ended a post on X with the line: “The public deserve to know the full facts as quickly as possible”, which has drawn some ire. Khayer Chowdhury, a Labour councillor in Redbridge, east London replied: “A disgusting tweet from a nasty party that is now rightfully heading straight into history’s dustbin. Have some self-respect and dignity you opportunistic, rancid idiot.” My thoughts are with the victims, Liverpool fans and the people of that great City this eveningThe appalling footage depicts a car being driven into fans as they celebrated Liverpool’s Premier League winThe public deserve to know the full facts as quickly as possiblehttps://t.co/ie4IpiAH6b Earlier this evening, Merseyside police and crime commissioner,Emily Spurrell, urged people not to speculate about the incident. 23 minutes after Philp’s tweet, Merseyside police released more information about the incident, including confirming that “the man arrested is a 53-year-old white British man from the Liverpool area”. Liam Robinson, leader of Liverpool city council is now speaking. He said: “I’d like to start by saying, on behalf of everyone here in Liverpool, how much our thoughts and prayers are with those affected by this appalling incident in the city center. “Today has cast a very dark shadow of what had been a joyous day for the city and the finale to a fabulous bank holiday weekend. I’d particularly like to pay tribute to the emergency services who responded to help those who were hurt, and to our NHS staff treating them in hospital. “We are working very closely with Merseyside police to support their investigation and with other relevant organisations to make sure those affected get the appropriate support. “I would appeal for people please do not share the horrifying footage of the incident on social media. If you have any information, forward it to Merseyside police to help them with their investigation. We won’t be commenting any further, but we will provide relevant updates as and when we know more and it’s appropriate to do so.”",

    "title": "Hamas agrees to a Gaza ceasefire, sources say; US and Israel reject offer",
    "article_text": "Hamas has agreed to a ceasefire proposal put forth by the United States for Gaza, according to Al Jazeera’s sources, but an American official rejected the claim and said the deal being discussed was “unacceptable” and “disappointing”. Israeli officials also denied that the proposal was from the US, saying on Monday that no Israeli government could accept it, according to the Reuters news agency. The conflicting reports came as Israeli forces kept up theirrelentless bombardmentof starving Palestinians in Gaza, and continued to severely restrict the entry of aid into the besieged enclave. Medical sources say at least 81 people, including many children, werekilledin Israel’s attacks on Monday alone. Al Jazeera’s sources said Hamas and the US’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, agreed to the draft deal at a meeting in the Qatari capital, Doha. They said it includes a 60-day ceasefire, and the release of 10 living captives held in Gaza, over two stages. US President Donald Trump would guarantee the terms of the deal and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. The agreement would also allow for the entry of humanitarian aid, without conditions, from day one, the sources said. Witkoff, however, rejected the notion that Hamas had accepted his offer for a captive and truce deal, telling Reuters that what he had seen was “completely unacceptable”. A US source close to Witkoff also told Al Jazeera that Hamas’s claims were “inaccurate” and the deal from the Palestinian group was “disappointing”. Al Jazeera’s Kimberly Halkett, reporting from Washington, DC, cited the US official as saying that the proposal on the table is only a “temporary ceasefire agreement” with Israel. “What this would do is allow for half of the living captives, as well as half of the deceased, to be returned,” she said. “In turn, the White House believes this would lead towards a diplomatic path of discussions that could result in a permanent ceasefire. And this is the deal that the source tells Al Jazeera is what Hamas should take,” she added. There was no immediate comment from Hamas. In Israel, meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a recorded message on social media, promising to bring back the 58 Israeli captives remaining in Gaza, of whom some 20 are believed to still be alive. “If we don’t achieve it today, we will achieve it tomorrow, and if not tomorrow, then the day after tomorrow. We are not giving up,” Netanyahu said. “We intend to bring them all back, the living and the dead,” he added. The Israeli leader made no mention of the proposed deal. Al Jazeera’s Hamdah Salhut, reporting from the Jordanian capital, Amman, said Netanyahu has long rejected Hamas’s calls for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and pledged to continue the war until “total victory” is achieved against the Palestinian group. “The Israeli premier has even added new red lines for what to him would bring an end of the war,” Salhut said. “That includes the return of the Israeli captives, the demilitarisation of Hamas [and] the exile of military and political leaders. And, also, the implementation of Trump’s plan for Gaza. This is a plan that has been widely condemned as ethnic cleansing, and the White House even walked it back several months ago,” she said. “But Netanyahu says that’s what he wants if there is to be an end of the war.” For its part, Hamas has said it is willing to free the remaining captives all at once in exchange for a permanent ceasefire. It has also said it is willing to cede control of the Gaza Strip to an interim government, as proposed in an Arab League-backed $53bn plan for the enclave’s reconstruction. The Palestinian group, however, has refused to lay down arms or exile its leaders from Gaza, saying the demand is a “red line” as long as Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory continues. In Gaza, Palestinians said they were desperate for any deal to bring an end to Israel’s relentless bombardment and blockade, which has left the enclave’s entire population on the brink of famine. “All Palestinian eyes are on Doha,” Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary said from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza. “Since Israel resumed the war, Palestinians have been attacked in their homes, schools, makeshift tents and also in so-called safe humanitarian zones… They are also saying they are not able to even secure one meal for their families,” Khoudary said. “Palestinians here are saying they do not have any options left, and they are trying to survive the Israeli air strikes and the mass starvation that has been imposed on them.” Israel resumed the war on Gaza on March 18, two weeks after imposing a total blockade on the enclave. Health authorities in Gaza say at least 3,822 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s renewed offensive, and the confirmed overall death toll has now reached 53,977. Some 122,966 people have been wounded. Israel eased its blockade last week, saying it has let in some 170 aid trucks into Gaza, but humanitarian officials say they are nowhere near the amount needed to feed the enclave’s two million people after 11 weeks of a total siege.",

Joseph Neumayer, who was born in Colorado and has U.S. and German citizenship, was taken into custody at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York City by FBI special agents after he was deported from Israel. According to the prosecutors, Neumayer traveled to Israel in April. On May 19, he arrived at the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv carrying a backpack. Without provocation, Neumayer allegedly spat at an embassy guard as he walked by and was able to flee as the guard attempted to detain him. He left his backpack outside the embassy after the tussle. A search of the backpack found three Molotov cocktails inside. Local law enforcement tracked down the 28-year-old at his hotel, where he was arrested. Investigators found that before he traveled to the embassy, Neumayer allegedly posted on social media: \"join me as I burn down the embassy in Tel Aviv. Death to America, death to Americans, and f***k the west.\" Authorities said that Neumayer also posted threatening messages on social media targeting President Trump. Israel deported Neumayer on Sunday. After his arrest in New York City, Neumayer was charged with attempting to destroy, by means of fire or explosive, the U.S. Embassy. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison. \"This defendant is charged with planning a devastating attack targeting our embassy in Israel, threatening death to Americans, and President Trump's life,\" Attorney General Pamela Bondi in a statement. \"The Department will not tolerate such violence and will prosecute this defendant to the fullest extent of the law.\" FBI Director Kash Patel said in a statement that Neumayer's alleged actions were \"despicable and violent\" and \"will not be tolerated at home or abroad.\" Lucia Suarez Sang is an associate managing editor at CBSNews.com.

He was 94. Born in Harlem on June 11, 1930, Rangel was a Democratic member of the House of Representatives for 46 years after unseating the legendary Adam Clayton Powell Jr. He was a Korean War veteran, the dean of the New York Congressional Delegation and a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus. \"A towering figure in American politics and a champion for justice, equity, and opportunity, Congressman Rangel dedicated over four decades of his life to public service,\" the Rangel family said in a statement announcing his death Monday. \"Throughout his career, Congressman Rangel fought tirelessly for affordable housing, urban revitalization, fair tax policies, and equal opportunities for all Americans.\" Rangel was pre-deceased by his wife, Alma. He is survived by his son, Steven Rangel, daughter Alicia Rangel Haughton, three grandsons, Howard R. Haughton, Joshua R. Haughton and Charles R. Haughton, the family said. The family said there will be private services followed by a public celebration of life. Dates have not yet been set. Rangel, affectionately called \"The Lion of Lenox Avenue,\" was the last of Harlem's so-called \"Gang of Four\" coalition with Basil Paterson, Percy Sutton, Herman \"Denny\" Farrell and former Mayor David Dinkins. They were known as the first to break down race and class barriers, cutting paths for others to follow. Rangel served New York's 13th Congressional District for 23 terms, where he sponsored 40 bills and resolutions that became law throughout his tenure. He went on to become the first Black chair of the House's influential Ways and Means Committee, and was a leader in the creation of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone Development Corporation that helped change the economic face of Harlem. \"There are many who will attempt to imitate, but the great Charlie Rangel will never be replicated,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement. \"Whether in the United States Army, the federal courtroom, the halls of Congress or the streets of Harlem, Congressman Rangel led a life of public service that is second to none. The prayers of a grateful nation are with his family and the legions who loved this iconic leader. May Charles B. Rangel forever Rest in Power.\" Prior to his election to Congress in 1970, Rangel earned a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star for leading a group of soldiers out of a deadly Chinese army encirclement during the Battle of Konu-ri. In 2008, Rangel faced a series of ethics violations alleging he failed to abide by tax laws. Critics put his\"Monument to Me\"at the Rangel Center at City College at the heart of the case. Rangel was charged with using public resources and congressional letterhead to seek donations for the center, soliciting from companies with business before the tax committee. He also faced charges of not disclosing income and checking accounts, and improperly using rent-subsidized apartments for his campaign committee. The House Ethics Committee convicted Rangel of 11 counts of violating House rules and the full Congress voted to censure him in 2010. Still, the people of Harlem reelected him to two more terms. When asked how he would like to be remembered, Rangel once said, \"If I'm gone, quite frankly, I don't give a damn.\" Gov. Kathy Hochul has directed state flags to be flown at half-staff on Monday and Tuesday to honor Rangel. They will also be lowered on the day of his funeral service. \"Charlie was a powerful voice in government and politics, and we remember him today for not only leading his life as a public servant of this great State but also for his dedicated service to our military in the Korean War,\" Hochul said in a statement. \"A fierce advocate for equal opportunity and a voice for Harlem, Representative Rangel's legacy shows us what we can accomplish as determined legislators. My thoughts are with all who loved him.\" Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer remembered Rangel as \"a great man, a great friend and someone who never stopped fighting for his constituents in Harlem.\" \"He was brilliant, bold, funny, fearless, all at once,\" Schumer said. \"The list of his accomplishments could fill pages, but one thing is certain. He left the world a lot better place than when he entered it.\" \"Charlie's lived experiences made him the man that he was,\" Congresswoman Yvette Clarke said. \"There's a saying -- when they made Charlie, they broke the mold.\" Congressman Adriano Espaillat, who became NY-13's representative after Rangel retired in 2017, said in a statement posted tosocial media, \"Charlie was an inspiration and embodied the truest form of leadership in public service, steadied in his faith and faithfulness in the American people, and a giant unmatched in his leadership, compassion, and commitment to upholding the values of our nation. I will miss him dearly.\" Mark Prussin is a digital producer at CBS New York. He covers breaking news, sports, politics and trending stories in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 26, 2025 / 10:40 PM EDT/ CBS News Three more inmates who escaped from aNew Orleansjail earlier this month have been captured, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill announced Monday. Two escapees remain at large. Inmate Lenton Vanburen was detained in Baton Rouge, Murrill saidon social media. Leo Tate and Jermaine Donald were arrested in Walker County, Texas, by the Texas Department of Public Safety, Murrillsaid in another post. Vanburen was originally serving time for a parole violation, possession of a firearm by a felon and illegal carrying of a weapon, Murrill said. Five people were arrested and charged with accessory after the fact for assisting Vanburen, Louisiana State Police said Monday evening. Tate was originally incarcerated on charges of burglary, possession of a firearm by a felon and illegal carrying of a weapon. He also has a criminal history that includes attempted second-degree murder, the attorney general said. Donald was originally arrested on charges of second-degree murder, aggravated battery and possession of a firearm by a felon. The three men will now both face additional charges related to the escape, Murrill said. The 10 inmates broke out of the jail on May 16, and three were captured in the first 24 hours after their escape. Surveillance videoshowed several inmates forcing open a cell door at about 12:22 a.m. CDT on May 16 and breaching a wall behind the cell's toilet. At around 1 a.m., video showed the inmates fleeing the building through a nearby loading dock, according to the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office. The escape went unnoticed by the sheriff's office until approximately 8:30 a.m. on Friday. At the time of the escape, no sheriff's deputy was assigned to the area where the inmates initiated the jailbreak. At least nine peoplehave been arrestedin connection with the escape of the 10 inmates, including a maintenance worker at the jail, whowas accusedof shutting off water to a cell that the inmates used in the escape by removing a toilet from the wall.

    "title": "Trump says he's pardoning Scott Jenkins, sheriff convicted of bribery",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 26, 2025 / 9:37 PM EDT/ CBS/AP President Trump said Monday he is pardoningScott Jenkins, a former Virginia sheriff who was convicted of making several businessmen sworn law enforcement officers in exchange for cash bribes. Former Culpeper County Sheriff Jenkins, 53, was found guilty on fraud and bribery charges and sentenced to 10 years in prison in March. But on Monday, Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social that Jenkins and his family \"have been dragged through HELL by a Corrupt and Weaponized Biden DOJ.\" \"This Sheriff is a victim of an overzealous Biden Department of Justice, and doesn't deserve to spend a single day in jail. He is a wonderful person, who was persecuted by the Radical Left \"monsters,\" and \"left for dead,\" Mr. Trump said in the post. \"He will NOT be going to jail tomorrow, but instead will have a wonderful and productive life.\" CBS News has reached out to Jenkins' attorneys for comment. Jenkins was indicted in 2023 on 16 counts. In December, a jury found Jenkins guilty of one count of conspiracy, four counts of honest services fraud and seven counts of bribery. Jenkins appealed his conviction in April. Federal prosecutorssayJenkins took$75,000 worth of bribes. He allegedly accepted cash and campaign contributions from eight people — including two undercover FBI agents — and in return, gave them badges and made them auxiliary deputy sheriffs, despite not having any training or vetting. He also allegedly pushed officials to restore one bribe-payer's right to possess a gun as a convicted felon. Jenkins took the stand in his own defense and said there was no connection between the payments he received and the badges he handed out, according tonewsreports. Testifying against Jenkins were the undercover FBI agents who were sworn in as deputies in 2022 and immediately thereafter gave Jenkins envelopes with $5,000 and $10,000 cash, respectively. Trump said Jenkins tried to offer evidence in his defense, but U.S. District Judge Robert Ballou, a Biden appointee, \"refused to allow it, shut him down, and then went on a tirade.\" Acting United States Attorney Zachary T. Lee said at the time that Jenkins violated his oath of office \"and this case proves that when those officials use their authority for unjust personal enrichment, the Department of Justice will hold them accountable.\" Alongstanding Trump supporter, Jenkins is the latest ally of the president to receive a pardon. On Mr. Trump's first day in office, he granted pardons and commutations to more than 1,000 people charged in theJan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. Mr. Trump has also granted clemency to several other public officials. He pardoned Illinois Gov.Rod Blagojevich, who was convicted of trying to sell Barack Obama's Senate seat, and Michelle Fiore, a Las Vegas politician and loyal Trump backerconvictedof paying for plastic surgery and other personal expenses with money intended to build a statue for a slain police officer. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 26, 2025 / 9:25 PM EDT/ CBS News Music legend Janet Jackson returned to perform on TV for the first time in seven years at the 2025American Music Awardson Monday. TheRock and Roll Hall of Fameinductee, who turned 59 earlier this month, sang and danced to her hits \"Someone to Call My Lover\" and \"All For You\" in front of the star-studded audience at the Fontainebleau Las Vegas on Memorial Day before she was honored with the show's Icon Award. \"I'm so honored. I'm so grateful,\" Jackson said as she accepted the award, previously given to Rihanna in 2013 and Lionel Richie in 2022. \"I mean no disrespect in any way but I don't consider myself an icon. My family, myself, our dream was to, it wasn't ever to be famous. We always had a special love for music, dancing and singing. Fame came as a result of hard work and dedication,\" she said. \"My story, my family story, is truly an American story. This would have only happened in America. The only thing that I hope for is that I've been an inspiration to other and artists to follow their dreams and succeed.\" Jackson, an 11-time American Music Award winner and a five-time Grammy winner, has been topping the charts for decades. The youngest of the 10 Jackson children, which included the late Michael Jackson, she grew up performing with her sisters and brothers. To date, \"Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814\" is the only album to generate seven top five-charting songs on the Billboard Hot 100. \"Someone To Call My Lover,\" part of the seventh studio album \"All For You,\" although originally released in 2001, recently climbed back on the Billboard 100 after the trackgained popularity on TikTok. With hit songs like \"All For You,\" \"That's the Way Love Goes,\" \"Nasty,\" \"Together Again\" and \"What Have You Done For Me Lately,\" Jackson was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019, with many seeing it as an overdue honor. In December 2024, Jackson launched a Vegas residency at Resorts World Theatre, and she's set to return to the same stage for three more performanceslater this week. Despite being one of the top-selling artists of all time, her career suffered from the fallout of the infamous 2004 Super Bowl halftime appearance with Justin Timberlake, when her bare breast was briefly exposed. For years, Timberlake has been panned for not initially defending Jackson, who was widely blamed for what was referred to as a \"wardrobe malfunction.\" He issued apublic apology in 2021.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 26, 2025 / 8:28 PM EDT/ CBS/AP President Trump said Sunday that the U.S. will delay implementation of a50% tariff on goods from the European Unionfrom June 1 until July 9 to buy time for negotiations with the bloc. That agreement came after a call Sunday with Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, who had told Mr. Trump that she \"wants to get down to serious negotiations,\" according to the president's retelling. \"I told anybody that, they have to do that,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on Sunday in Morristown, New Jersey, as he prepared to return to Washington. Von der Leyen, Mr. Trump said, vowed to \"rapidly get together and see if we can work something out.\" In a social media post Friday, Mr. Trump had threatened to impose the 50% tariff on EU goods, complaining that the 27-member bloc had been \"very difficult to deal with\" on trade and that negotiations were \"going nowhere.\" Those tariffs would have kicked in starting June 1. The announcement, along with threatened tariffs on Apple products, sent the stock market tumbling Friday. \"Just when markets believed the worst of the tariff battle had been overcome, President Trump threatened a 50% tariff against the EU this week, starting on 1 June, and a possible 25% tariff on iPhones produced abroad. This could all be a negotiating tactic, but the uncertainty caused by this back-and-forth is not good for global growth or markets,\" Klaus Baader, an analyst with SG Securities, told investors in a report. But the call with von der Leyen appeared to smooth over tensions, at least for now. \"I agreed to the extension — July 9, 2025 — It was my privilege to do so,\" Mr. Trump said on Truth Social shortly after he spoke with reporters on Sunday evening. For her part, von der Leyen said the EU and the U.S. \"share the world's most consequential and close trade relationship.\" \"Europe is ready to advance talks swiftly and decisively,\" she said. \"To reach a good deal, we would need the time until July 9.\" © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "article_text": "Nearly a dozen people, including two children, were hospitalized aftera boat explosion and fire in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on Memorial Day evening, officials said. The incident was reported around 5:45 p.m. Monday near the New River Triangle, not far from the Lauderdale Yacht Club on Southeast 12th Court. U.S. Coast Guard officials said there were 13 people on board the boat when there was an explosion. “For reasons that we don’t know yet, a boat exploded, it tossed people into the water, good Samaritans came over right away and started rescuing them,” Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue spokesman Frank Guzman said. “It’s too soon to know how this happened. We have a fire investigator on scene, as well.” Footage from a surveillance camera captured the moment the fireball erupted on the boat, and showed multiple people spilling into the water. Guzman confirmed there were 11 patients, including two children, who were initially taken to Broward Health Medical Center. “A number of the patients had significant burns and are being transported to Jackson Memorial Hospital, where they have a burn unit,” Guzman said. “A lot of them had burns to much of their body.” Officials at Jackson Memorial said they received 10 patients, including eight adults who were in good condition and two children who were in fair condition. One patient had to be intubated. Antonio Rivero said he was with family members on the boat when it went up in flames. “Tried to fuel up the boat, and must have been a gas leak and, you know, spark went off and explosion,” Rivero said. “One of the guys' pants were blown off, so it was bad.” Rivero, 32, suffered burns to his arm, but his wife, Cassandra, and their two children remained hospitalized Monday night. “They’re OK because they’re on a lot of meds, but other than that they’re fine,” he said. At least one witness reported seeing an explosion and said they saw multiple people with burn injuries who were brought to the yacht club docks. The victims had burned legs and bathing suits that appeared ripped and burned to shreds, the witness said. Two other witnesses said they were on a dinghy at the sandbar when the boat exploded. “When they went to start their boat up, it just exploded. There was a huge fireball and people were kind of falling off the boat,” Bret Triano said. “We were at the sandbar too and we just tried to go help out.” Triano and Marisa Toomesn were able to rescue some of the victims. “There were a couple boats trying to pick people up and one guy just didn’t get picked up so we went over to him,” Triano said. “He was screaming.” “He was burned pretty badly,” Toomesn said. “He was saying, 'Save me. Please, don’t let me die. I’m so hot, I need water,’” Triano said. “He just kept repeating, ‘I want water, I want water.’” Aerial footage from Chopper 6 showed Fort Lauderdale Police, the U.S. Coast Guard, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the Broward Sheriff’s Office assisting Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue. Crews were seen examining the boat involved, which was tied up to a nearby sea wall. Guzman said crews also rescued a dog that had been on the boat that wasn’t injured. The FWC and fire officials will investigate the cause of the explosion.",

    "title": "Three more inmates who escaped from New Orleans' main jail are captured",
    "article_text": "Three inmates accused of escaping from New Orleans’ main lockupin one of Louisiana’s biggest jailbreaks everhave been apprehended, leaving two at large, officials said Monday. Jermaine Donald, 42, who was jailed on charges of second-degree murder and other crimes before he escaped, was taken into custody in Texas with another inmate accused of fleeing the Orleans Justice Center on May 16, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said in a statement. That inmate, Leo Tate, 31, had been in custody on burglary and firearms charges, Murrill said. The Texas Department of Public Safety arrested the two men in Walker County, north of Houston, the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office said in a statement. Separately, Lenton Vanburen, 26, who was jailed on firearms and parole violation charges, was taken into custody in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the city’s police department said in a statement. The three inmates will face additional charges, Murrill said in a statement. It was not immediately clear whether they have lawyers to speak on their behalf. Deputy U.S. Marshal Brian Fair attributed the capture of Donald and Tate to a dayslong, multi-agency effort that tracked the pair to the Houston metro area. He said the U.S. Marshals Office for the Southern District of Texas responded after being forwarded a \"collateral lead.\" The suspects were taken into custody during a traffic stop, he said. Fair described the remaining two inmates who have not been captured as \"extremely dangerous\" and said they could be anywhere. \"Both of them and other of the people on the run have had a support network in the New Orleans area, but they could be outside of the New Orleans area,\" he said. \"It’s going to take a lot more work to figure out where they are exactly.\" One of the men, Derrick Groves,was convicted of second-degree murderand attempted second-degree murder last October. Several people,including a jail maintenance worker, have been accused of assisting in the escape. Sterling Williams, who was charged with principle to simple escape and malfeasance in office, cut off the water to a cell's toilet so inmates could remove it without flooding the area, Murrill alleged in a news release last week. According to an affidavit in support of an arrest warrant, Williams told authorities that one of the inmates who escaped threatened to “shank” him if he did not help. That inmate, identified in the document as Antoine Massey, has not been apprehended. Williams' lawyer disputed the affidavit, saying his client was unaware of the inmates' escape plan. Williams turned off the water,the attorney told the Associated Press, to help fix a clogged toilet. After the men removed the toilet, the affidavit alleges, the inmates sawed through steel bars and escaped through a hole in the wall before they scaled a barbed-wire fence using blankets. A photo released by authorities showed the phrases “To Easy Lol” and “We Innocent” written above the toilet.",

    "title": "Deputies shoot man who survived apparent gator attack and tried to steal their gun, sheriff says",
    "article_text": "A Florida man who was apparently bitten while swimming in alligator-infested waters Monday morning was fatally shot after, officials said, he emerged from the lake and charged at sheriff's deputies with garden shears. Two deputies, including a trainee, opened fire on Timothy Schulz, 42, after they deployed a stun gun that appeared to have no effect and after Schulz tried to remove a firearm from their patrol cruiser, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd told reporters. “The fact that he was bitten by an alligator and still continued his rampage is shocking,” Judd said. Authorities first responded to a call involving Schulz at 5:56 a.m., when he appeared at a racetrack shaking and asking to call his son, Judd said. Deputies who responded to the area could not find him, the sheriff said. Nearly two hours later, a witness spotted Schulz in Lakeland, south of Orlando, and reported that the man was in a lake with “a lot” of alligators, Judd said. “A witness actually took a life vest and tried to give it to him,” he said. “He wouldn’t take it.” Another witness told authorities that Schulz growled when the person tried talking to him. The witnesses reported that Schulz was treading water and that they could see only his head. At one point, an alligator appeared to bite his right arm, Judd said. After he emerged from the lake, Schulz was seen walking between houses in a residential area, carrying a pair of garden shears. At one point he threw a brick at a truck, Judd said. As deputies arrived, Judd said, they saw Schulz apparently trying to break into a vehicle and quickly got out of their cruiser. When Schulz charged at them with the shears, Judd said, they ordered him to drop the tool, then deployed the stun gun when he did not. Schulz climbed into the passenger side of the deputies' patrol vehicle and appeared to try and remove a rifle or shotgun, Judd said. \"At that time our deputies shot multiple times,\" Judd said. \"As a result, Timothy is deceased.\" He said the deputies will remain on administrative leave while the state’s attorney’s office reviews the shooting, per department policy.

    "title": "MOZA releases replica Essenza SCV12 wheel , giving us poors a chance at going hands on with a Lamborghini",
    "article_text": "The wheel debuted at the Dallas Dreamhack in a killer sounding sim. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Our favourite makers of affordable racing rig hardware are teaming up with one of the least affordable car manufacturers for a very slick looking wheel collab. TheMOZA Racing x Automobili Lamborghini Squadra Corse SCV12sim racing wheel debuted at the Dallas DreamHack convention this week, treating attendees to a first look at this piece of kit. The wheel is the second collaboration betweenMOZAand Automobili Lamborghini, and is based off the track-only hypercar, the limited edition Lamborghini Essenza SCV12. The DreamHack setup paired the new wheel with the MOZA R16 Direct Drive Wheelbase and mBooster active pedals, to get the most realistic experience out of the collaboration. We've been super impressed with MOZA's budget racing solutions, but this configuration is definitely using some of the brand's pricer tech,like the R16 Wheelbase starting at $639 USD at the moment thanks to sales.The R16 Direct Drive Wheelbase, is the second fanciest the brand currently offers and is currently 20% off. It features 16Nm of direct drive torque, as well as a 21-bit magnetic encoder. This is supported by a high-performance slanted pole servo motor and the body is said to be made of aviation-grade aluminum. All of this hardware is combined with what MOZA calls the NexGen 4.0 force feedback algorithm, to deliver as realistic a sim experience as possible. ThemBooster active pedalsare also no slouch. It comes in two different configurations but I'm guessing they went all out with the set with the $999 USD CRP2 throttle for this experience. Regardless, these pedals are packing dual 200KG load cell sensors with a 21-bit high-resolution magnetic encoder. They sport a high-torque density motor to power it all, and the G-force feedback. Plus, you can make customisations with the MOZA Pit House software to dial in your driving style. This makes for a much pricier setup than theMoza R5 Bundlethat impressed us with it's formidable nature despite budget price.That bundle is also 27%off at the moment, starting at $435. The Revuelto replica sim racing wheel is touted as a faithful recreation of the steering wheel out of Lamborghini's V12 machine. So even though we're not expecting it to be as cheap as some of the gear we've enjoyed from MOZA, it's probably the most affordable way most of us will ever put our hands on the wheel of a Lambo. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. There's no word on the cost of the wheel as it's not quite available for sale, yet. If you're mad keen to get your hands on this collab keep your eyes on the Moza website for the launch.

    "title": "Today's Wordle answer for Tuesday, May 27",
    "article_text": "Get all the help you need with today's Wordle. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If you find yourself with a bunch of yellow letters and no idea what to do with them, we can help. We can help a little, by giving you a unique clue for today'sWordle, and we can help a lot, by offering a clickable link to the May 27 (1438) answer. And even if you're doing fine, our tips can give your general game a fresh angle. Today's Wordle pretty much threw itself at me from the very first row, swiftly leaving me with nowhere to go but a win. Swift. Simple. All done until tomorrow. There are worse ways to start a Tuesday, that's for sure. Don't worry if your opening guess is all grey and the good bits of the alphabet seem to be hiding from you, today's clue can help. Physical activity is the name of the game today, specifically the general catch-all term for the more formalised and official sort. Sprinting, football—anything, really. No, there is not a double letter in today's puzzle. A good starting word can be the difference between victory and defeat with the daily puzzle, but once you've got the basics, it's much easier to nail down those Wordle wins. And as there's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day, here are a few tips to help set you on the right path: There's no racing against the clock with Wordle so you don't need to rush for the answer. Treating the game like a casual newspaper crossword can be a good tactic; that way, you can come back to it later if you're coming up blank. Stepping away for a while might mean the difference between a win and a line of grey squares. Another win, right here. The answer to the May 27 (1438) Wordle isSPORT. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Past Wordle answers can give you some excellent ideas for fun starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. They are also a good way to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer is unlikely to be repeated. Here are some recent Wordle answers: Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day, and you'll need to work out which secret five-letter word is hiding inside them to keep up your winning streak. You shouldstart with a strong wordlike ARISE, or any other word that contains a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You'll also want to avoid starting words with repeating letters, as you're wasting the chance to potentially eliminate or confirm an extra letter. Once you hit Enter, you'll see which ones you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the dailyWordlepuzzle to give readers a hint each and every day. Her Wordle streak is truly mighty. Somehow Kerry managed to get away with writing regular features onold Japanese PC games, telling today's PC gamers about some of the most fascinating and influential games of the '80s and '90s.

(File photo: AP/Lee Jin-man) SEOUL: South Korea's liberal frontrunner for president, Lee Jae-myung, was leading his main conservative rival Kim Moon-soo by more than 10 percentage points in an opinion poll issued on Tuesday (May 27), though the race had tightened a week ahead of the election. The deeply polarised country holds a snap election on Jun 3 to pick a successor to ousted leader Yoon Suk Yeol, whosebrief martial law impositionheightened long-simmering political disputes and sparked massive nationwide protests. The next leader will have to mend the reputation of a country that transitioned from dictatorship to a democratic success story in the 1980s while spurring stalled growth, managing uncertain United States trade policies and dealing with nuclear-armed North Korea. The Democratic Party candidate Lee, who has advocated using fiscal policy to support the economy and bringing to justice anyone involved in Yoon's botched attempt to declare martial law in December, had 49 per cent public support against Kim of the People Power Party with 35 per cent, the Gallup Korea poll showed.

REUTERS/Issei Kato/File Photo TOKYO :Japan's Ministry of Finance (MOF) will consider tweaking the composition of its bond programme for the current fiscal year, which could involve trimming the issuance of super-long bonds, two sources told Reuters on Tuesday. The MOF will make a decision after holding discussions with market participants around mid- to late-June, the sources who had direct knowledge of the plan said. The plan comes amid recent rises in super-long bond yields to record levels, due largely to dwindling demand from traditional buyers like life insurers. If the MOF were to reduce issuance of 20-, 30- or 40-year Japanese government bonds (JGB), it would likely increase issuance of shorter-dated debt instead, the sources said. As such, the total planned size of JGB issuance for the current fiscal year that ends March 2026 will remain unchanged from 172.3 trillion yen ($1.21 trillion), they said.

    "title": "Two charged for instructing foreign workers to hold placards in illegal protests at construction site",
    "article_text": "Singapore Singapore Both will return to court on Jun 24 for further mentions of their cases. Migrant workers holding placards at a worksite. (File photo: Reddit) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Two people were charged on Tuesday (May 27) in relation toillegal public assemblies involving foreign workersin October last year. Rebecca Rubini Ravinthiran, 33, and Vee Derrick Mahendran, 36, both Singaporeans, were also charged for abetting foreign workers to commit offences under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA). In an earlier joint press release, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and the police said that Ravinthiran is accused of directing 15 foreign workers under her employment to gather outside two construction sites on Oct 24. She also instructed the workers to hold placards to demand payments owed to her company. Mahendran allegedly aided the offence by going to a construction site to \"ensure that the foreign workers complied with the woman's instructions\". Ravinthiran faces 17 charges in total while Mahendran has 11. Two of Ravinthiran's charges are under the Public Order Act, while 15 are under the EFMA. She is accused of organising a public assembly to demand that Apex Engineering be paid the outstanding payment owed to it by instructing no fewer than nine workers from Apex to gather at a construction site at Block 324A Tengah Garden Walk - Parc Flora @ Tengah - and hold placards. No permit had been granted for the event on Oct 24, 2024, stated the charge sheet. Separately, at about 11am the same day, Ravinthiran is said to have organised a public assembly to publicise the same cause at a construction site at 91A Jalan Satu - Dakota Breeze. She allegedly instructed no fewer than six workers from Apex to gather at the site and hold placards. This event similarly had no permit. Each of Ravinthiran's charges under the EFMA states that she instigated a foreign worker to breach the condition of their work permit, with a total of 15 workers involved. She is said to have facilitated each worker's contravention by instructing each to be involved in the illegal activity of participating in a public assembly at either work site. For two of these workers, Ravinthiran allegedly instructed them to prepare and distribute placards and coordinate with other workers to be involved in the public assembly. Mahendran's charges comprise two under the Public Order Act and nine under the EFMA. Mahendran is said to have abetted Ravinthiran by helping organise two public assemblies at the two construction sites to publicise the same cause. He allegedly helped in the preparation of the placards the day before, and coordinated with Ravinthiran on the gathering of the workers to hold the placards. He is said to have ensured that no fewer than nine workers from Apex gathered at the Tengah construction site. As for the charges under the EFMA, Mahendran is said to have helped nine foreign workers contravene the conditions of their work passes by supervising them while they were involved in the illegal public assemblies. He then allegedly updated Ravinthiran on his observations and conveyed her instructions to the group of workers. Both cases will return to court on Jun 24. Last October, MOM said on Facebook that it was aware of a social media post regarding several migrant workers holding placards at a worksite. MOM said it engaged the workers involved and found that they were not owed salary payments, and did not have any concerns about their well-being. Then-Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam has also said that MOM was investigating the employer for illegally deploying the workers and abetting the workers to perform illegal acts under the EFMA. A person convicted of organising a public assembly without a permit can be fined up to S$5,000 (US$3,890). Under the EFMA, a person convicted of abetting a foreign employee to break the terms of his work pass can face up to 12 months' jail, be fined up to S$10,000, or both.

    "article_text": "Singapore Singapore Life expectancy at birth for Singapore residents improved 0.9 years over the last decade, SingStat's data showed. File photo of people crossing the street at South Bridge Road in Singapore. (Photo: CNA/Syamil Sapari) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Singapore residents' life expectancy at birth rose to 83.5 years in 2024, an increase of 0.3 years from the previous year. The preliminary data released by the Department of Statistics (SingStat) on Tuesday (May 27) also showed life expectancy improved over the last decade, up from 82.6 years in 2014. Life expectancy in 2023 was affected by higher mortality rates due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \"As these higher mortality rates are assumed to apply throughout a lifetime, life expectancy data for 2023 may not accurately represent the number of years individuals can expect to live, if mortality rates return to pre-pandemic levels,\" SingStat said. At age 65, life expectancy improved from 20.9 years in 2023 to 21.2 years in 2024. It increased by 0.6 years over the last 10 years, from 20.6 years in 2014. Data on life expectancy in SingStat's report shows the average number of additional years that people might expect to live if these mortality rates apply throughout their lives. It does not take into account future changes in mortality, said the department. Resident male life expectancy at birth stood at 81.2 years last year, an improvement of 0.2 years from 2023. Over the last decade, resident male life expectancy improved by 0.9 years. The resident life expectancy for men at 65 also rose from 18.8 years in 2014 to 19.5 years in 2024. Female life expectancy at birth was 85.6 years in 2024, up 0.3 years from 2023. Over the last decade, it has increased by 0.8 years. The resident life expectancy for women at 65 rose from 22.1 years in 2014 to 22.7 years in 2024. The report also showed that the expected survival rates of Singapore resident newborns continued to improve in general between 2014 and 2024. For newborn boys, the proportion expected to be alive at 65 years old increased from 88.8 per cent to 89.8 per cent, while the proportion expected to live to 85 increased from 41.5 per cent to 45.6 per cent. Newborn girls showed better survival rates, with the proportion expected to be alive at 65 years old increasing from 93.5 per cent to 94.3 per cent. Females who are expected to live to 85 rose from 57.8 per cent to 62.9 per cent.

Asked about a report that SoftBank Group  Chief Executive Masayoshi Son is proposing to establish a Japan-U.S. sovereign wealth fund, Kato said at the news conference that the government, at least at the finance ministry, was not aware of the specifics of such a plan. The Financial Times reported on Sunday that Son was floating the idea of creating a joint sovereign fund to make technology and other investments across the United States.

    "article_text": "East Asia East Asia From left: South Korea's presidential candidates Lee Jae-myung of the Democratic Party, Kim Moon-soo of the People Power Party, Lee Jun-seok of the New Reform Party and Kwon Young-guk of the Democratic Labor Party, pose for a photo ahead of the second televised debate for the upcoming presidential election in Seoul, South Korea, on May 23, 2025. (File photo: AP/Kim Hong-ji) This audio is generated by an AI tool. South Koreans are set to finally choose a new president after the nation’s worst constitutional crisis in decades. The Jun 3 election to replace ousted conservative leader Yoon Suk Yeol offers to be a potential turning point that either brings stability to the political realm and markets after months of chaos or deepens painful divisions within the nation. The leadership vacuum since the end of last year has battered confidence among consumers and businesses, helping to push the economy into reverse just as United States President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs cast a shadow over future growth. The snap vote was called after Yoon wasremoved from poweron Apr 4for violating the constitution, less than three years after he became president. Under South Korean law, an election has to be called within 60 days of the removal of a president.

Yoon shocked the world in December by declaring martial law for the first time since the launch of full democracy in the nation about 40 years ago. His decree, partly aimed at overcoming a political stalemate in the opposition-controlled parliament, was quickly overturned by lawmakers, who then impeached him. South Koreans vote for one candidate, with the winner serving a single, five-year term. Voting is not compulsory. The two main candidates vying to become president are left-leaning Lee Jae-myung, former head of the main opposition Democratic Party, and right-winger Kim Moon-soo of the People Power Party (PPP). While their political careers have taken them in different directions, both are former labour activists. Kim was imprisoned for leading a pro-democracy movement inthe 1980s when South Korea still had military rule. Lee, 60, lost to Yoon by a razor-thin margin in the last presidential vote in 2022, but enjoyed a majority in parliament that he used to frustrate Yoon’s policy agenda. He then led the impeachment campaign to oust Yoon after the martial law fiasco. After Yoon’s ousting, Kim, 73, won the support of the PPP’s rank and file to stand as a candidate instead of the leadership’s choice of a more centrist alternative. Kim won plaudits from some conservatives for opposing Yoon’s impeachment, but he will need to appeal beyond the party’s hardcore support if he is to build momentum for a successful campaign. The PPP, which had been struggling to broaden its support base, recently saw its backing grow after the candidates’ first TV debate and Yoon’s departure from the party. Among other candidates in the race is 40-year-old Lee Jun-seok, a former PPP leader now standing for the Reform Party, a recently formed right-wing party. Lee Jun-seok could serve as a spoiler vote by dividing conservatives. He takes a far more critical line on Yoon’s martial law and has so far refused tojoin an alliance with Kim. In the past, Lee Jae-myung likened himself to Bernie Sanders, but he has moved closer to the centre since the last presidential election by shedding or watering down plans such as introducing universal income. Still, a Lee administration would likely mean more government spending to aid households, state support for developing the AI industry and greater rights for smaller shareholders to help loosen the grip of controlling families on the nation’s biggest conglomerates. Lee has proposed shortening the presidency term to four years from five while allowing two terms through a vote as early as next year. Kim has characterised himself as the business-friendly choice. He says he would press ahead with deregulation to spur growth while offering support for small firms. Kim also wants to lift the limit of presidential terms from one to two — and make them four years each. He has suggested the upcoming leader shorten his tenure to three years to expedite the reform. Lee Jun-seok is trying to appeal to a younger but still conservativedemographic with a message that he doesn’t come with the baggage of the PPP leadership that failed to swiftly part ways with their ousted leader Yoon. Lee advocates for more support for science researchers, deregulation for companies and a lowerminimum wagefor some foreign workers than for Koreans. Lee Jae-myung is the clear frontrunner but recent polls show his lead over Kim is narrowing. Lee had the backing of about 49 per cent of respondents in a Gallup Korea poll, against 35 per cent for Kim. If either the Reform Party’s Lee Jun-seok or Kim pulls out of the race, the other remaining conservative candidate could draw level or evenwin the election if they attract the support of their departing rival. Both conservative politicians have so far insisted they would not drop out. Past elections have seen candidates withdraw mid-campaign despite vowing not to. Shoring up growth will be a key task for Yoon’s successor. The shrinking of the economy in the first quarter of2025 demonstrates the fragile state of business activity and consumer sentiment even before exporters absorb the full force of Trump’s new duties. Enhancing access to affordable housing and creating more jobs would offer a more tangible improvement for people’s livelihoods. Restoring a sense of national unity is another issue cited in polls. While that is more easily said than done, a period of greater stability under a new leader would help calm tensions. Long-sought constitutional reform to allow consecutive terms might also bring more continuity to South Korean politics. The importance of foreign policy has also been flagged in polls as a key concern, given the potential economic damage of tariffs and the need to deter the threat of North Korea’s ever advancing military capabilities and its alliance with Russia. The new leader will need to figure out how to press ahead with stronger trilateral security ties with Washington and Tokyo as concerns grow over Trump’s commitment to existing defence arrangements. Much-improved relations with Japan under Yoon are perhaps most at risk given a tendency for new leaders in South Korea to pull the rug on progress already made. Lee’s current political stance looksless likely to make diplomatic whiplash than in the past, though he may return to amore conciliatory stancevis-a-vis Pyongyang, a pattern that has played out before with a switch away from conservative rule. If Kim Moon-soo wins, expect a continuation of Yoon’s hardline on North Korea and South Korea’s strengthening of trilateral ties with Japan and the US. The conservative candidate has also talked about the need to pursue NATO-like nuclear sharing arrangements. Another key question is how South Korea will seek balance in the face of an intensifying rivalry between its security ally, the US, and its biggest trading partner, China. South Korea’s exports are equivalent in size to more than 40 per cent of the economy, making it one of the most vulnerablecountries when it comes toTrump’s tariffs. Lee has said there’s no need to rush into an early agreement in talks with the US, saying the US doesn’t necessarily have an “overwhelming upper hand” in the negotiations. Kim has said he would seek an immediate summit with Trump to resolve the tariff issue, if elected. As a deal before the election seems unlikely, those negotiating stances might influence voters. On the margins, how candidates respond totalk of US troop reductionsor bumping up the contribution Seoul makes for the American military presence might also provide food for thought. South Korea’s energy mix is likely to go through major shifts depending on who wins the election. Lee has pledged to shut down all coal-fired power plants by 2040 and opposes building new nuclear reactors. Lee has called for expanding sources of renewable energy. Any roll-back in nuclear policy would contrast with a global resurgence in interest in the low-carbon energy source, as countries such as China, Japan, the UAE and France all push to build or revive reactors to help reduce their carbon footprints. Kim supports nuclear energy as a cheap and safe source for power generation.

REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha/File Photo TOKYO :Toyota is moving some production of its GR Corolla sports car to Britain and will spend around $56 million on a dedicated line there to build exports for North America, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. By shifting some production from Japan, Toyota aims to use excess capacity in Britain to help it cut delivery wait times for the car, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The move was not in reaction to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on automobile imports, they said. The Trump administration agreed this month to reduce tariffs on auto imports from Britain to 10 per cent on up to 100,000 vehicles a year. Japan is seeking to have repealed the 25 per cent tariffs that the U.S. has imposed on all auto imports. For global automakers, the tariffs mean an additional challenge on top of differing emissions standards, and customer demands, across major markets.

The American market accounts for one-third of the company’s revenue.

They have to pay their suppliers but they don’t have any income so that makes it hard to survive.” Lau’s company Kam Pin Industrial, which has been in business for more than six decades, supplies exterior wall panel products to commercial buildings in Hong Kong, China and the US. These include American firms like tech giants Google and Amazon in various US states. Lau said he has tried to enter other markets like the Middle East, but their populations are much smaller than America’s. “(The) US market is a big market and they can pay higher prices. They are looking for some quality products, and sometimes they need them fast, (which means) they don't mind paying higher prices,” he added. “So, this market is difficult to be replaced as far as we are concerned.” Hong Kong has about 360,000 SMEs, most of them in the trade and wholesale industries. They employ about 1.2 million people, accounting for 43 per cent of the city’s total private sector manpower. According to a 2024 survey conducted by the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, more than three-quarters of the city’s SMEs had not yet recovered to pre-COVID pandemic levels. The tariff war is expected to make the path to recovery even more uncertain. Businesses in Hong Kong could soon also no longer be able to rely on mainland China as an affordable production base. Gary Ng, a senior economist at investment banking firm Natixis, said this is due to global supply chain fragmentation. “If (a business) wants to target the rest of the world as the alternative market, it will need to start thinking of production elsewhere beyond mainland China, given the tariff escalation which may not be limited to the US in the future,” he noted. “If the door of the US is shut, then obviously finding other markets will be very essential.” But while relocating production will likely take longer to materialise, Hong Kong’s SMEs are facing another pressing issue – shipping. Lau said no shipments from China to America were made in April and early May – in the thick of the tariff war – but when the truce came into effect, everyone began “asking for space to ship to the US”. “I don’t think (shipping companies) have sufficient ships to serve this critical moment,” he added. “And also, the price of the shipment will be high too. The demand and supply is not even.” He added that there is more certainty in working on US projects, as American firms usually sign a contract and detail the project timeline in advance. This allows him to organise his manufacturing production systematically. “Some projects in Hong Kong and also in China, they're not confirmed until the last minute,” he noted. “So we are happy with the US style and also, of course, their payment is much greater than Hong Kong and the Chinese markets.” Lau added that his company is also constantly trying to come up with new designs by holding monthly research and development meetings. “We try to improve and try to save costs … if you stand still, you will be eliminated by your competitors,” he said.

    "title": "New Zealand teen dies after taking part in rugby-inspired social media craze",
    "article_text": "World World The \"run-it-straight challenge\" involves participants charging each other head-on with no protective gear. SYDNEY: A teenager has died in New Zealand after taking part in a rugby-inspired social media craze that sees participants sprint and crash into each other, police said Tuesday (May 27). The \"run-it-straight challenge\" has gone viral on social media across New Zealand and Australia, attracting huge crowds to events where participants charge each other head-on with no protective gear. According to the New Zealand Herald, the challenge involves a runner and a tackler running full speed at each other on a field measuring 20m by 4m. A 19-year-old died from a \"serious head injury\" in New Zealand's North Island after playing the game with friends over the weekend, New Zealand Police said in a statement. \"The man suffered a serious head injury when tackled and was taken to hospital by friends,\" police inspector Ross Grantham said. \"Tragically, he passed away in hospital on Monday night. \"We would urge anyone thinking about taking part in a game or event like this to consider the significant safety and injury risks.\" Grantham said the incident was an impromptu game among friends, not a planned event. However, the \"tragic outcome does highlight the inherent safety concerns with such an activity\". The incident is not considered a criminal matter, but the police will continue to undertake enquiries on behalf of the coroner, Grantham added. Organised run-it-straight competitions offer thousands of dollars in prize money and have drawn interest from ex-professional rugby players. Experts have likened the game to a combat sport, warning that participants face serious concussion risks.

    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Women Women Women People Women Wellness Wellness Wellness Experiences Living Living People Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Obsessions Dining Experiences Dining Dining Experiences Travel Travel Experiences Entertainment Entertainment A recent TikTok advertisement by digital payment company Visa showed snippets of past Blackpink concerts and ended with a poster seemingly announcing the dates for the Singapore leg of Blackpink's upcoming world tour titled Deadline. A TikTok ad by Visa seemingly indicated that K-pop girl group Blackpink will stage a Singapore concert in November. (Photos: Instagram/blackpinkofficial, TikTok/Visa) This audio is generated by an AI tool. Is Blackpink coming to our area after all? Early this year, Blinks in Southeast Asia were left disappointed after an announcement for Blackpink's upcoming Deadline tour revealed thatthe group would not stage any stops in the region. However, a recent TikTok ad by digital payment company Visa might have just let slip that the quartet – comprising Jisoo, Jennie, Rose and Lisa – will be performing two shows at Singapore's National Stadium this November. Netizens were recently alerted to Visa's ad which showed a compilation of clips from previous concerts by Blackpink. The 30-second-long video then ended with a graphic showing the purported dates of Blackpink's upcoming concert in Singapore. According to the graphic, Blackpink will be performing at Singapore's National Stadium on Nov 29 and 30 with Visa cardholders apparently entitled to a presale session for tickets on Jun 11. While some fans have rightfully questioned the authenticity of the video, a quick check of the video's URL indicates that it shares the same user tag as other official Visa videos on TikTok. As of writing, there have been no official announcements from Live Nation Singapore, YG Entertainment and Visa on any potential Singapore stops for Blackpink’s Deadline tour. CNA Lifestyle has reached out to Live Nation Singapore for comments. Blackpink's upcoming tour Deadline will kick off on Jul 5 at South Korea's Goyang Stadium. A recent video by YG Entertainment founder Yang Hyun-suk indicated that Blackpink will release a new song \"soon\". Yang, however, has stated the agency does not have \"a confirmed date\" for the song, leading many fans to doubt if the song will be released before the start of the Deadline tour.

    "title": "Bosch powers the future of mobility in Southeast Asia",
    "article_text": "Advertorial Advertorial As electric vehicles gain traction across the region, clearer information, stronger infrastructure and broader choices are key to accelerating adoption. With technological advances and strong government support across many countries, owning an electric vehicle is not just an eco-friendly choice, but a financially smart one. Photos: Bosch This audio is generated by an AI tool. Electric vehicles (EVs) are steadily becoming part of everyday life in Southeast Asia, as more consumers make the switch to greener transport options. According to Mr Vijay Ratnaparkhe, president of Bosch Southeast Asia, EV adoption in the region has gained momentum in recent years,rising from 9 per cent in 2023 to 13 per cent in 2024. In Singapore,the shift is even more pronounced: About one-third of new cars registered in 2024 were electric, up from nearly one in five in 2023, and just over one in 10 in 2022. Despite the encouraging trend, growth has not been as rapid as many had anticipated. Mr Ratnaparkhe noted that key challenges remain, particularly regarding cost, resale value, battery performance and charging accessibility. Against this backdrop, global technology supplier Bosch believes that closing infrastructure gaps and educating the public about misconceptions surrounding EVs is essential for the EV transition to gather momentum. OVERCOMING BARRIERS TO EV ADOPTION Southeast Asia’s varied landscape and infrastructure present a unique mix of obstacles and opportunities. While some markets have experienced faster adoption spurred by government incentives, others continue to lag due to infrastructure limitations and consumer hesitance. A major hurdle is the absence of a robust and widely accessible charging network. Without enough charging stations, many drivers experience “range anxiety”, the fear that their vehicle might run out of power before reaching a charger. Mr Ratnaparkhe highlighted that while earlier EV models had shorter ranges, today’s vehicles have made significant strides. “Thanks to ever-improving range prediction and navigation systems showing available charging stations, EV drivers can now clearly understand how far their battery will take them and where nearby charging stations are. By continually assessing the driver’s surroundings, the vehicle can provide precise range calculations, minimising anxiety,” he explained. “Range capabilities will only get better. With advances in battery technology and the adoption of more efficient components, such as the use of silicon carbide in inverters, EVs will continue to go farther on a single charge.” Another challenge is the uncertainty around battery health and resale value. Cost-conscious buyers in the region often consider long-term maintenance and potential resale value before committing to a purchase. As a result, many consumers opt for hybrid vehicles, which feel more familiar and are seen as less risky, particularly amid concerns about battery degradation over time. To tackle these concerns, Bosch has launched a battery certification service. This initiative enables buyers of used EVs to evaluate a vehicle’s remaining battery life and value, ultimately boosting confidence in second-hand EV purchases. DEBUNKING MYTHS ABOUT ELECTRIC VEHICLES Despite growing EV adoption, persistent myths about EVs continue to influence consumer perceptions. One common concern is the perceived poor performance in wet weather and safety in floods, issues that are being actively addressed through advancements in EV design and engineering. “EVs are designed and tested to resist water damage, just like combustion cars,” said Mr Ratnaparkhe. He explained that the battery pack is insulated and protected with additional shielding, while the high-voltage cables linking the battery to the motors are also insulated. Moreover, electric and hybrid vehicles are equipped with fail-safe systems that automatically shut down the electrical components in the event of a collision or short circuit. “While driving through floodwaters is generally not advisable, the idea that EVs are unsafe because of the battery is a misconception,” said Mr Ratnaparkhe. Another common concern is the cost of owning an EV. According to Mr Ratnaparkhe, the upfront price of EVs is decreasing due to mass production and improvements in battery technology. While tariffs may affect supply chain costs, tax incentives and road tax exemptions in some countries have helped narrow the price gap with traditional vehicles, making EVs more accessible. PROMISING SIGNS ON THE ROAD AHEAD With continuous advancements in technology and strong government support across many countries, owning an EV is becoming both a financially smart and environmentally responsible decision. “Our internal data shows that EVs produce 20 to 30 per cent less carbon dioxide emissions over their life cycle compared to equivalent petrol or diesel cars,” Mr Ratnaparkhe said. This assessment includes emissions from manufacturing, driving and recycling. Looking towards 2030, Bosch expects the environmental benefits of EVs to become even more significant. By then, new EVs are projected to emit around 40 per cent less carbon dioxide than their conventional counterparts. Mr Ratnaparkhe added that EV adoption in Southeast Asia is set to accelerate. The entry of more automakers, a wider variety of models and falling battery prices are making EVs increasingly attractive and accessible. Younger, more eco-conscious buyers, are also playing a key role in driving demand for EVs. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence is enhancing the EV experience by enabling real-time analytics, predictive maintenance and personalised driving features. “Software will play an increasingly important role in shaping the future of mobility,” said Mr Ratnaparkhe. “With new hardware and software solutions, we are helping to make mobility safer, more efficient and more sustainable.” To learn more about Bosch’s expertise in e-mobility, visit theBosch website.

The towering necks of two Brachiosauruses, one of which is nearly three storeys tall, greet visitors at the entrance. (Photo: CNA/Khoo Bee Khim) This audio is generated by an AI tool. The warning signs, flashing lights and snapped cables can only mean one thing. Something big, prehistoric and full of teeth has escaped. And right on cue, the rockstar of the Jurassic World movie franchise, the Tyrannosaurus rex, roars to life as you round the corner. If you've always wondered what it's like to visit Isla Nublar, the fictional island home to de-extinct engineered dinosaurs, you can finally get a glimpse of it at the immersive exhibition Jurassic World: The Experience, which opens on Thursday (May 29). \"Nublar\" means \"to cloud\" in Spanish and no other location in Singapore is morefitting than Gardens by the Bay's misty Cloud Forest to stage the life-sized sculptures and animatronics equipped with motion sensors byNeon, the same team behind 2022'sAvatar: The Experience. Thepair of Brachiosauruses greeting you at the entrance, one of them with a towering three-storey-tall neck, is reminiscent of thefirst Jurassic Park movie in 1993. T-Rex and those slender-necked giants aren't the only bigwigs around. A pair of Velociraptors pose mid-action in their raid of the Pteranodons' nests hidden in the conservatory's Cloud Mountain. It's the perfect backdrop to imagine Scarlett Johansson, Jonathan Bailey and Mahershala Ali in the upcoming new Jurassic World Rebirth movie that opens on Jul 3. A crashed truck in the foliage reveals a confused bone-headed Stygimoloch trying to bust its container. Further down the path, you'll spot the long, swaying neck of another Brachiosaurus, this time, much closer than the pair at the entrance. If you spot a crowd gathering, chances are, the keepers have brought out the weeks-old baby dinosaurs, Stiggy and Bumpy, for a little show-and-tell and interaction. But not allof the smaller creatures are harmless like the Compsognathuses or Compys perched on rocks throughout Cloud Forest. They may look vulnerable,until you remember the little girl who wandered a little too far in the movies... You start to wonder, too, how good is your impression of Chris Pratt's Owen Grady, as you descend the escalator to meet Blue and the rest of the volatile velociraptors rattling their cages. But hold that thought as you come face to face with the fringed Dilophosaurus. These animatronics don't spit venom but they do spit– don't say we didn't warn you. The exhibition is also a chance to learn about theferns, conifers and cycadsthat the dinosaurs fed on.At Evolution Walk, you'll even see the ancestors of plants, imagined in 3D reconstructions, that existed millions of years ago. There’s no time limit to explore the exhibits but do allocate about an hour for the experience. And if you linger till past sunset, you'll be treated to a whole new different perspective.

    "article_text": "Business Business FILE PHOTO: High-rise apartment buildings and high-rise office buildings are seen along Tokyo Bay waterfront area at dusk in Tokyo, Japan November 30, 2023.  REUTERS/Issei Kato/File Photo TOKYO :A leading indicator of Japan's service-sector inflation hit 3.1 per cent in April, data showed on Tuesday, keeping alive expectations of further interest rate hikes by the central bank. Service-sector inflation is being closely watched by the Bank of Japan for clues on whether prospects of sustained wage gains will prod firms to continue raising prices, and keep inflation sustainably around its 2 per cent target. The April year-on-year gain in the services producer price index, which measures the price companies charge each other for services, followed a revised 3.3 per cent increase in March, BOJ data showed. The BOJ ended a decade-long, massive stimulus programme last year and in January raised short-term interest rates to 0.5 per cent on the view Japan was on the cusp of durably meeting its 2 per cent inflation target.

    "title": "D.S. & Durga's First Men's Fragrance Line Is Finally Here",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Ever since its founding two decades ago in Brooklyn,D.S. & Durgahas steadily become one of the most popular indiefragrancebrands around. Its husband-and-wife founders—David Seth Moltz and Kavi Ahuja Moltz—have released a steady stream of sure-to-appeal fragrances that not only smell good, but they elicit certain feelings and emotions through each scent's dedicated backstory (who wouldn't feel a little giddy-up in their step after a spritz ofCowboy Grass?). The brand's inventory of scents has always been unisex, with no onescentever truly being in the camp of “for men” or “for women” (save for the difference between the fragrancesCowboyGrass andCowgirlGrass). But Seth Moltz, the brand's self-taught perfumer, decided it was time to release a limited-edition line of fragrances inspired by classic men's colognes—hence, the brand's first foray into a dedicated men's line of scents. \"It is still my position as a brand that it's kind of dumb to say: ‘This is for men; this is for women,\" because it doesn’t matter,\" Seth Moltz says. “You decide that. I have my opinion about what I find to be masculine [and] find to be feminine, so I've made myself colognes for forever that I've never released and I just thought it'd be so cool to put these [new colognes] out there as a one-off launch.” The result is D.S. & Durga's line of The Colognes—Golf Jazz, a grassy, woody number;Grey Blazer, a spicy, herbaceous fragrance; andRum Bay Rum, an intoxicating neroli scent—that are contemporary takes on common masculine scents that Seth Moltz says would easily slot into a man's lifestyle: a scent for work, play, and sport. And Seth Moltz doesn't want the perfumeheads to come after him: He knows the designation of “colognes” means the percentage of perfumed oil in the product—and therefore potency and longevity of the scent—but acknowledges how “'cologne' is like a dog whistle for [men's] fragrances.” While D.S. & Durga has certainly always had scents that, by smell, skewed more traditionally masculine or feminine, the release of The Colognes can be seen as a signifier for heterosexual men, who Seth Moltz says are “traditionally the ones who are not wearing stuff [across gender] lines,” that there are these fragrances that are in line with those classic male scents they've been accustomed to. He also reiterates “this is [not] a line for just men,” though can surely see current D.S. & Durga offerings getting the “Cologne” distinction because of their traditional leanings towards what a male fragrance is. But until then, Golf Jazz, Grey Blazer, and Rum Bay Rum make the great basis for the start of an excellent fragrance rotation.

    "title": "Elisabeth Moss Thinks The Handmaid’s Tale’s Final Scene Is “Honestly Perfection”",
    "article_text": "Elisabeth Mosshas been steeped in the dystopian world ofThe Handmaid’s Talefor six seasons. But as Hulu’s Emmy-winning drama drew to a close, its themes got even more personal for the actor and producer—who welcomed a daughter of her own in 2024. “I think it wasn’t until the end of the season that I really realized the effect that becoming a mom had on the season as a whole,” says Moss just beforeThe Handmaid’s Taleairs its series finale. “I am not a writer on the show, so I don’t come up with the storylines. But I do think there’s an influence that happened because of this new chapter in my life.” The series has expanded far beyond the events ofMargaret Atwood’s seminal novel, which inspired season one in 2017.TV criticsand fans of the show oftenbemoaned storylinesthatseemed cyclical—ones in which Moss’s June would escape the theocratic Gilead, only to decide to return there in order to fight back against its oppressive regime. This season, though, Moss was adamant that the show conclude on a note of hope. “It’s not the first show I’ve ended,” says Moss, referring to other massive hits likeThe West WingandMad Men.“And it is impossible to make everyone happy. Look: When I see a show, I tend to buy into whatever the creators of the show put forward as their ending. I’m the type of person who is like, If that’s the way that they think this show ends, then that’s the way that it ends. I loved the ending ofThe Sopranos,ofBreaking Bad,ofSeinfeld.The ending ofFriday Night Lightsis amazing.” If Moss had her way, she would have made two or three more seasons ofThe Handmaid’s Tale.Thankfully for her, and for fans of theHandmaid’suniverse, Hulu is doing the next best thing—the streamer has orderedThe Testaments,an adaptation ofAtwood’s 2019 follow-up novelthat takes place 15 years post-Handmaid’s.ShowrunnerBruce Millerhas been working with Moss for several years now on the sequel, which will follow a trio of women:Ann Dowdreprising her role as Aunt Lydia;Chase Infinitias Agnes, the daughter of a Handmaid; andLucy Hallidayas Daisy, who grew up free in Canada. The Handmaid’s Taleitself loaded many climactic moments into its penultimate episode—a cathartic battle in which Gilead’s oppressed finally got their revenge in gruesome, satisfying fashion, and the deaths of both June’s best frenemy, Commander Lawrence (Bradley Whitford), and her boyfriend, Nick (Max Minghella). The finale, by contrast, is quieter. We learn thatLuke (O-T Fagbenle)has found his calling, helping Mayday in the fight against the regime, and that both he and June will work forever to bring their daughter, Hannah, home. Serena (Yvonne Strahovski) is off to another undisclosed location in order to raise her son safely, thanks to June’s help yet again. There’s a surprise return from Emily (Alexis Bledel), as well as a poignant moment in which June and her own mother (Cherry Jones) reach an understanding of what maternal love truly means. The series’ ending scene is “honestly perfection,” says Moss. “And I would never have settled for anything less than perfection when it came to this ending. We return back to the beginning, to the first scene. She starts to record that book. The fact that this show started with a book and ends with the book is the only way it can end. Margaret has this quote: ‘A word after a word after a word is power.’ And I think that that is where June ends. She’s like, I am going to tell my story, because my story and these words have power. And I love that. She sits down, and she’s going to tell her story to Hannah. It’s for her.” Below, Moss opens up about saying goodbye to a show she doesn’t want to let go of, finishingHandmaid’s as a new mom, and filming that very last scene. Vanity Fair:As a new mom of a baby girl, I found that watching this season was, like, 10 times harder than it ever was in the past. And it was already hard. As a new mom of a baby daughter, did it also feel harder for you? Elisabeth Moss:Yeah, I think so. I mean, I don’t know if it felt super different watching it, just because I’m so inside of it that it is difficult for me to be objective in that way. But I think the acting side of it definitely felt different. I felt like the emotion just came a lot quicker and was more visceral. If you play a detective or something, you have to imagine you’re a detective. So you’re slightly stepping back from it. But being a mom, and really feeling like I had someone specific to think about when I was doing those scenes—yeah, I did feel different. There’s a line in the second-to-last episode, where June is talking to Commander Wharton (Josh Charles) about Gilead. She says ,“It’s a horror show run by men twisting his words. You’re frauds, all of you. It’s never been about piety; it’s always been about power.” That line felt like something you’d hear in or about America right now. This material has had that kind of relevancy for so long. It was relevant in 1985, when Margaret wrote the book; it was all from real life, whether in this country or another. And I feel like it has just continued that way. I think that’s why people responded to the book and then the show—because it’s always felt very close to home. It has been a unique experience, that’s for sure. But it’s definitely not been something that we revel in by any means. Most of the time, the show feels like watching a near-future documentary. We approach it as, This is the story that we’re here to tell. And it feels honest and true, both about the personal side of things and the political side of things. And that’s all we’ve ever tried to do. We don’t have any agenda or some lesson that we’re going to teach each week. We always just try to be true to the story and true to the characters. I think that people forget that most of the scripts were written in 2023, early 2024. We have known what was going to happen on the show for so long, and then it comes out a year and a half to two years later, and the relevancy is something people feel very deeply. But we were just trying to tell the right story and be honest. This season had a few more comic moments—dark, gallows humor—than past seasons. Was that intentional? It was absolutely intentional. I’m super glad to hear you say that. We are very aware of what the perception of the show is. It’s not like we make it in a vacuum and don’t care what anyone thinks—we don’t make it for ourselves; we make it for the audience. So we’re very aware that the show is dark, and sometimes that is something people don’t want to see, especially if they’ve had a dark day. We wanted to inject as much positivity and hope and a little bit of humor when possible. Even if it is, like you said, a gallows humor. We wanted to try to have that as much as possible to make it watchable, and to make it also true to life—because life isn’t necessarily all doom and gloom all day, you know? And at the same time, we have to be loyal to the tone of the show. I think if we had gone too far in that direction, people would be like, What is this? Like, much to my disappointment, there is no musical episode this season. Although I would have been way too excited about that. [Laughs] So we had to draw the line. But it felt possible to go a little bit further with the humor. Serena and June have always been so intertwined. But this season felt like their relationship was brought to a whole new level. Yeah. We had to. There was a tremendous amount of passion with so many of the characters, because you have this one final chance to take them to wherever you want them to end up. And I feel like that has been building with Serena and June since season three, when they were at the Lincoln Memorial. I feel like their relationship is the centerpiece of the show. It is the love story of the show. They’re the heroes and the villains of the show, and they often trade places in those roles. So we really wanted to leave it all out on the dance floor, for lack of a better way of saying it—to give these two characters as much opportunity as possible to go as far as possible. The opportunity to have that last scene between them and have it beexactlywhat it should be—which is Serena asking for forgiveness, and June giving it after all these years—was just so delicious. I did keep wondering just how many times can June possibly save Serena. And for her then to offer her forgiveness—why was that a “delicious” moment for you? Well, number one: It’s not for Serena; it’s for Noah. June knows that Serena does need that forgiveness, and June is big enough to give it. She’s a pretty great person. I admire her very much, and she has many wonderful qualities. And one of them is the capacity to say that to Serena, because she knows that Serena will be a better person having heard it, and she will be a better mom to Noah. And that’s what matters the most to June. Serena needs to move on and give Noah the best life possible, and in order to do that, she needs that forgiveness from June. And June knows that. It’s as simple as that. Now, whether or not she really forgives her—probably not. It doesn’t even really matter. It’s not what June needs. How do you ever forgive somebody for the things that Serena has done? But it’s kind of not about that, though. Speaking of motherhood, June’s own mother, played by Cherry Jones, also returns. And that felt really cathartic. It wasn’t my idea to have [Holly] come back, but there was a leaning into that, or an exploration of that story, that became very prominent. It was my idea to make sure she came back [in person], because it was supposed to be a phone in episode 10 [where they reconnect]. For me, this season is about motherhood in all kinds of ways—the motherhood that Aunt Lydia gives to her girls, the generosity of arranging for Naomi to give Charlotte back to Janine. Naomi becomes a mother when she [does that]. There are so many different ways that you can be a parent, or a parental figure, or a mother figure. It was an interesting choice to make Ann Dowd’s Aunt Lydia sympathetic in the end. Though I guess that was necessary, considering the storyline ofThe Testaments. Yes. Margaret wroteThe Testaments,and there were a couple of things in that sequel that we then have to follow. One of them is Hannah not getting out, and the other is this turn for Lydia. Now, I will say that Margaret wrote it after we started filming [the first season], and I know Lydia is very cruel, and there’s a lot not to forgive. But I do think there are elements of Ann’s performance in the beginning of this show that allows for the possibility of making that turn. Any good actor will deliver a multidimensional performance, and any good actor will make sure that you see both sides of something. Like Yvonne [Strahovski] has too. And you’re working onThe Testaments,yes? Yes. I’m an executive producer—been producing it from the beginning. But a little thing calledThe Handmaid’s Talegot in the way. Right. Not only did you produce this show and star in it, but you also directed the first two and the last two episodes of this season—all while being a new mom. Why? [Laughs] That’s a question from a new mom, that’s for sure! Out of all of the interviews I’ve done for months and months and months now, you’re the first person to ask why. So I appreciate that. Thank you. Going back [to work] at three months [postpartum] was not easy. But how do I put this? There was no way I was going to stop any of those paths, really. And they all happened at the same time. This show isn’t a job for me—it’s been my life for the past nine years. I had this opportunity to direct, and be a massive part of it in a different way than producing or acting. Directing is just different than anything else. And I was lucky enough to be asked to do it. I knew I’d regret it if I said no. Absolutely no part of me is going to say it was easy, though of course I will also say I come from a very privileged position of having a lot of help—there are women who do a lot more with a lot less, and I am in awe of those women. But that said, it wasn’t a walk in the park. Part of my thought process was that in a way, it’s very meta of the show. And this final season is very meta, and the last episode is very meta. June has to make a choice to do something that she feels like is the best thing for her children. And in a small way, I hope one day my daughter watches, and I hope that she’s proud [of me]. Like, “Look what my mom did when I was just a few months old.” I hope that it’s an example for her of the power of womanhood, and of being a working mom and how incredible that is. Looking back, I’m like, Wow, I can’t believe I did that. But I’m glad I did. I have no regrets. What were some things about the last two episodes that, as the director, you wanted to make sure to do or portray to close out the series? There were three things. First, I wanted that revolution. I wanted Mayday to be able to actually attack and actually have some real change. Of course, it’s a battle that was won, not the war, but we really wanted that satisfaction for the audience. The second thing was the relationships—making sure that we honored these incredible characters in the relationships they had formed. You only have two hours to do that in, and after nine years and six seasons, that is really hard. We could have done an entire episode on every single character’s ending. But we couldn’t. We had to focus on June’s point of view Even if it was getting all those women together and having that karaoke scene, giving them that as their final moment, it felt important to do that. The final thing was ending it on a note of hope. We wanted to end it on a note of, “This isn’t over.” June has a story to tell, and is going to tell it for her daughters. She’s going to fight for their future and for the future of the next generation. I know that it’s just a set, but what was it like to sit in June’s—Offred’s—room again? I remember watching the final take of the final shot, and it’s the one we use in the episode—it’s the only time I cried on set. I turned to my DP, and I had tears in my eyes, and I said, “That’s how this series ends.” Sitting in that room, it felt very sacred. I closed the set that day. Normally, we only close the set when there’s an intimate or particularly sensitive scene. But I wanted, as a director, to protect my actor—who was me. And I wanted to be able to feel like it was only me in that room, to feel super safe and like I didn’t have a lot of eyes on me. The other cool thing was, you would’ve thought this crew was painting the goddamn Sistine Chapel that day. You have never seen people so focused. It was the sweetest thing, this crew—props, dolly grip, lighting, everyone. It was as if they were finishing their masterpiece. They wanted everything to be perfect, and it was a very moving thing to be a part of. How do you say goodbye to something like this? I don’t think I have yet. We just did the final mix on episode 10 last week. We’ve been literally working on the show this whole time. There are still effects that aren’t approved yet. So, to be totally honest, we’re kind of still working on it. It doesn’t feel like it’s done, and I don't feel like I’ve had to say goodbye. There’sThe Testaments,so it does feel like it’s not over, like the story is continuing. I don’t know if I have to say goodbye, which is good, because I don’t really want to.

    "article_text": "Follow us on Follow us on 0Shares Hong Kong racing The 62-year-old chases city circuit success and also gives updates on top-class pair Ka Ying Rising and Rubylot byOwen Goulding Shares David Hayes has high hopes for Chateauneuf making barrier 11 look insignificant when he lines up in the Class Three Seine Handicap (1,200m) at Happy Valley on Wednesday night. The Fastnet Rock gelding snapped a losing run of nine races when he blazed home to win the Class Three Parislongchamp Handicap (1,200m) three weeks ago. From the inside draw, Luke Ferraris pinged him out into the box seat along the rail and angled out his mount as the field turned into the home straight. When asked, Chateauneuf engaged the afterburners and scorched clear by just over two lengths. The handicapper had his say with a nine-pound rise and drawing barrier 11 is not ideal either, but Hayes is hoping another smash break could help his four-year-old overcome his car-park draw. Chateauneuf spanks 'em! 🔥Easy win in the finale for David Hayes' galloper and@LukeFerrarisat Happy Valley tonight...#HappyWednesdayu|#HKracingpic.twitter.com/XASlY0TeWL “He got a beautiful run from the inside gate last time, but now he’s got a wide gate and topweight,” said Hayes. “His trackwork suggests he’s held his form and his last couple of starts he’s been a fast beginner, so if Luke jumps well he’ll angle him outside the leader. “The time before when he went to the front, his instructions were actually to go back to last, but he jumped so fast that he improvised and it was the right decision. “If he shows that gate speed again, the 11 gate might not be as bad as it first looked. Though I’d be more concerned about the barrier than the weight he’s carrying. “The way he’s been training lately, he’s been training like he’s an 80-rated horse.” UNBELIEVABLE! 🤯31 years since River Verdon won the#TripleCrownfor the first time, Hong Kong has a second winner of the series in Voyage Bubble, who makes light work of his Champions & Chater Cup rivals... 🏆🏆🏆@WorldPool|@mcacajamez|#HKracingpic.twitter.com/bIP5MwdPxa Hayes was given a big reason to smile on the weekend when Rubylot ran a mighty race to finish second to Voyage Bubble in the Group One Standard Chartered Champions & Chater Cup (2,400m). Settled towards the rear of the field, Rubylot skimmed the paint throughout under Hugh Bowman and lashed home in the final 200m to pick up the second-place cheque. Any stamina doubts were quickly cast off and has left Hayes with plenty of options for next season, though he will be mindful who Rubylot goes up against. “We don’t count Voyage Bubble as a local – he’s an international horse – and of the locals who ran in the QE II, we were confident he could beat them all,” said Hayes. “It was a great effort to run second to a true champion. “We’ll go where Romantic Warrior and Voyage Bubble ain’t next season! We’ll put him away now for a well-deserved rest and he’ll be raring to go for the new season.” And Hayes also gave a positive update on superstar sprinter Ka Ying Rising, who was last seen extending his winning sequence to 12 in a dominant Group One Chairman’s Sprint Prize (1,200m) performance on Champions Day at Sha Tin. “Ka Ying Rising has been holidaying and going out in the paddock every day. He’s starts trotting next week, ready to peak in October,” said Hayes. Hayes remains in contention for the trainers’ title with just 14 meetings to go before the curtain comes down, sitting five winners behind John Size.

    "title": "Jewellery that offers surprise and meaning with hidden elements",
    "article_text": "Jewellery with hidden design elements allows wearers to carry personal messages close to their hearts – and delights their designers too There’s a quiet fascination to high-end jewellery designs – a hypnotic beauty, where clean lines and sleek surfaces exude a serene elegance. Yet, it’s within these subtle details that true stories unfold. Hidden mechanisms, exquisitely constructed, invite interaction: a gold bracelet that unveils secret compartments and intricate scenes; a minimalist ring that unfurls into a decadent cascade of dazzling diamonds. These creations transcend mere adornment – they transform, engaging wearers in personal narratives of discovery and surprise. Speaking to Gübelin’s dedication to personal, emotionally resonant design, president Raphael Gübelin notes that every Gübelin creation is set with their iconic ruby. This “deeply inspired” philosophy celebrates the intricate inclusions found within gemstones, inviting wearers to forge personal connections with their jewellery. “The iconic Gübelin ruby holds a deep meaning,” he says. “To me, it symbolises the passion for gems that my family has cherished for generations.” By placing gems in concealed locations, designers offer wearers a private connection to their jewellery. Hannah Freeman of Hannah Estelle Fine Jewellery says: “Adding subtle details to jewellery has truly become a form of intimacy. It’s a way to keep a loved one close – like a tangible extension of a memory or moment from the past. I love that these details aren’t always obvious to others, yet still allow you to hold space for someone or for a time that mattered.” These pieces serve as reminders that true beauty lives beneath the surface, waiting to be discovered. “Over the years, I’ve done many personalisations of jewellery for people,” says New York City-based jeweller Ray Griffiths. “Engraving is a common form – often, we engrave the inside of rings, especially for wedding and engagement pieces … At the moment, I’m working on a pendant for a client who lost her husband of 50 years. I have his hair, which I’ll set beneath a cut quartz lens on the back of the pendant. It’s a very personal and emotional project.”",

    "article_text": "Snake catcher safely removed the reptile; it will be released back to the wild A couple in their village home in Sha Tin, Hong Kong, experienced a scare on Monday when they spotted a highly venomous king cobra snake on their computer desk. A snake catcher was called to safely collect the reptile, which measured about one metre (3.3 feet) in length. According to a police spokesman, the snake will be released back into the wild. The force said it received a report at 1.41am that the snake had entered the house on To Shek Street. The male resident of the flat shared what he called a horrifying experience on the social media platform Threads, saying his girlfriend was shocked when she spotted the snake on the computer desk behind some cables right before going to bed. He said he called police and they waited for about 45 minutes for the snake catcher to arrive. Snakes and lizards found in parcel from Hong Kong to Australia Snake handler Ivan Li Yat-long, who was not involved in the capture on Monday, said it was rare to see a king cobra sneak into a house. The snakes can release a huge dose of neurotoxin through a single bite, which can be fatal. Li reminded people to call police immediately if a snake entered their home, and advised they not disturb the reptile but watch it while waiting for a snake catcher to arrive. Ensuring a flat was not cluttered could also prevent snakes from seeking out a resting place inside a flat, he added. King cobras are found on Lantau Island and in the New Territories, he said, adding they could grow to three to four metres in length. He said it was rare for king cobras to enter houses, although cases had been recorded. “These snakes usually enter houses through windows and sewer pipes,” he added.",

    "article_text": "Governments are buying up gold as they see it as a safe investment – and, in some cases, a tool for evading Western sanctions But economists say that there is another important factor driving the rally: purchases by central banks. In this explainer, we explore why central banks are increasingly turning to gold assets, how that is driving a long-term structural shift in demand for the metal, and what that means for gold prices going forward. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the wave of Russian asset freezes by Western countries that followed “marked a turning point” for the way central banks viewed gold, according to a report by Goldman Sachs Research. Central banks’ purchases of gold have increased fivefold since the invasion began, and demand from governments is expected to remain high for some time to come, giving gold prices an “ongoing boost”, the report said. “In many cases, these initiatives are for purely economic benefits,” the article said. “However, gold is also being used by US adversaries to evade sanctions or finance activities that counter US national security interests.”",

We have been fighting for years to address this problem caused by the national and local governments, and we are finding that an increasing number of our Japanese friends are also now voicing their opposition to the policy,” Choe told This Week in Asia. “But basically, Japan is politically very unfriendly to the North Korean community here,” said Choe, who now acts as an adviser to the publication and is active in supporting causes important to Chosen Soren. The organisation is a legacy of Tokyo’s colonial rule of the Korean peninsula between 1910 and the end of World War II in 1945, during which thousands of Koreans were brought to Japan to work for Japanese companies.

This is expected to boost local industrialisation as well as help Nigeria to capitalise on its rich deposits of lithium, a critical material for EV batteries and other electronics. Chinese firms mining lithium in the country were seeking full-cycle local manufacturing, Yu told Dele Alake, Nigeria’s solid minerals development minister, in the capital Abuja on May 15. “[Chinese] President Xi [Jinping] prioritises African industrialisation,” Yu added, as he outlined the plans under way for the EV and battery plants in Nigeria. Alake welcomed Beijing’s moves, citing Nigeria’s new focus on local value addition in leveraging natural resources, especially lithium, by encouraging local processing and EV manufacturing. This drive is clear in Nasarawa state, a solid minerals hub in Nigeria’s north-central region that has attracted huge Chinese investment in the mining and processing of lithium.

The Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, which stretches over a vast tract of land in western China, has become a hugely popular destination among domestic tourists in recent years, receiving a record 302 million visits last year. Now, local officials have published an action plan to further grow the region’s culture and tourism sector, with a target of raising the industry’s annual revenue to at least 1 trillion yuan (US$138 billion) and receiving at least 400 million visits per year by 2030, according to the document published on Sunday. The plan will involve opening up the region to more foreign tourists, with the document including references to strengthening the development of cross-border tourism and expanding trade in cultural goods and services. Xinjiang – which is famous in China for its stunning natural scenery and diverse mix of ethnic groups – is not currently fully open to foreign nationals. While international visitors can generally enter the region freely, they normally need special permits to visit some tourist attractions, such as the huge Bayinbuluke grassland, according to China-based travel agencies that organise trips for foreigners.",

On Sunday, hundreds of athletes competed in a 62.4km (38.8-mile) race at the Hong Kong Trail Championships in Tai Mei Tuk, chasing qualification for the World Mountain and Trail Running Championships in Spain in September. There was also a short-course race of 34.3km, and an 11km “experience group”. Before the Hong Kong Association of Athletics Affiliates (HKAAA) event got under way, local trail runners questioned why the race was taking place when temperatures could soar to 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit) and humidity was high. The HKAAA had yet to respond to the Post’s request for comment. A social media post by Asia Pacific Adventure Athletes, attributed to its director Ryan Blair, said: “This is a perfect case of how a sport gets mismanaged (and in this case worse with serious safety and health risks to athletes). “Firstly, they [the HKAAA] are holding a 60km qualifier race tomorrow [Sunday] – this is so crazy and dangerous in May’s oppressive SE Asia summer heat and only puts so many runners’ health at risk.”",

Such a shift, some analysts warn, could erode South Korea’s deterrence posture against North Korea and entangle it in wider US-China rivalries. Still, concerns persist in Seoul that changes could be coming – and not just under the guise of regional flexibility.",

Glenn Ivey, D-Md., for making a \"shameful\" Memorial Day trip to El Salvador in an attempt to visit deported illegal immigrant and suspected MS-13 gang memberKilmar Abrego Garcia. TheWhite House’s rapid response account said of Ivey's trip, \"This moron spent his Memorial Day trying (and failing) to visit a criminal illegal immigrant gangbanger in a foreign country. For Democrats, criminal illegals > American citizens every time.\" Ivey posted about the attempted visit on his X account, saying that he represents Abrego Garcia, and that the Salvadoran government stonewalled his efforts to conduct a welfare check. \"Today, I was denied access to seeing my constituent, Mr. Kilmar Abrego Garcia. If there is nothing to hide, cut the crap.

I won’t stop until we do,\" Ivey added in an X post. Abrego Garcia’s deportation to his home country, El Salvador, has caused significant controversy. TheTrump administrationhas pointed to evidence suggesting that Abrego Garcia was involved with MS-13 and human trafficking to justify his deportation. The administration has also cited court documents detailing Abrego Garcia’salleged physical abuseof his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura. Democrats, meanwhile, say he is a \"Maryland man\" who was not given his due process in court before being deported. Since Abrego Garcia’s deportation, several Democrats, including Sen.Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., have made trips to El Salvador to conduct similar wellness checks and to advocate for his release. The trips have stirred significant controversy as well, with many asking why Democrats are spending so much time advocating for a suspected gang member who was unlawfully present in the U.S. MARYLAND DEMOCRAT IVEY FURIOUS NOT GIVEN ACCESS TO KILMAR ABREGO GARCIA IN EL SALVADOR In this handout provided by Sen.

The trooper noticed eight individuals in the car with Abrego-Garcia, who said he began driving three days prior from Houston to Temple Hills, Md., via St. Louis to \"perform construction work.\"(Tennessee Highway Patrol) The report states that the trooper suspected it was a human trafficking incident, as there was no luggage in the vehicle. Additionally, the individuals in the car reportedly gave the same address as Abrego Garica's home address. When speaking with the trooper, Abrego Garcia allegedly \"pretended to speak less English than he was capable of and attempted to put encountering officer off-track by responding to questions with questions.\" After the incident, the officer decided not to give Abrego Garcia a citation for the driving infractions, but rather to give him a warning for driving with an expired license.

    "article_text": "Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., discusses the investigation into the alleged cover-up of former President Biden’s decline on ‘Jesse Watters Primetime.’ House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., is demanding several high-ranking staffers in former PresidentJoe Biden’s White House appear for transcribed interviews on their suspected roles working \"behind the scenes\" to \"cover up\" the former president’s significant mental decline during his term. Comer, who leads the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, sent interview requests to four key BidenWhite Houseaides — former director of the Domestic Policy Council Neera Tanden, former assistant to the President and Deputy Chief of Staff Annie Tomasini, former senior adviser to the first lady Anthony Bernal and former deputy director of Oval Office operations Ashley Williams. Comer said that all of these high-ranking staffers worked \"behind the scenes\" and \"ran interference for President Biden\" to avoid his worsening condition from being discovered during his time in office.

Comer told Fox News last week that these \"unelected bureaucrats\" had an overwhelming influence over Biden and were possibly serving as \"de facto\" presidents in his stead. \"Today, we are calling on President Biden’s physician and former White House advisors to participate in transcribed interviews so we can begin to uncover the truth,\" Comer said in a statement. The GOP effort comes shortly after the release of \"Original Sin\" by CNN host Jake Tapper and Axios reporter Alex Thompson, which claims that the Biden White House was going all out trying to control the perception of the aging president’s failing health. The bookexposes the cover-upof Biden's decline and his decision to run for re-election. Tapper saidduring an interviewwith Piers Morgan on Monday that what Biden's aides did to hide his condition from the public could be \"even worse\" than the Watergate scandal during Richard Nixon's presidency. \"It is a scandal. It is without question, and maybe even worse than Watergate in some ways,\" said Tapper. \"The only reason we invoke Watergate is just to make clear like, it's not Watergate — this is an entirely separate scandal, maybe even worse.\" CREDIBILITY CRISIS: WHITE HOUSE REPORTERS SPEAK OUT ON WHETHER BIDEN'S MENTAL DECLINE WAS DELIBERATELY HIDDEN Jake Tapper said during an interview with Piers Morgan that the cover-up of former President Biden's decline was worse than Watergate.(Getty Images) In his letters, Comer said that while the committee has been investigating the cover-up for nearly a year, \"newfound details regarding President Biden’s obvious decline demand renewed scrutiny of White House personnel actions and knowledge of relevant information over the course of the prior administration.\" Comer said the committee is seeking \"to understand who made key decisions and exercised the powers of the executive branch during the Biden Administration.\" \"The cover-up of President Biden’s obvious mental decline is a historic scandal,\" he said. \"The American people deserve to know when this decline began, how far it progressed, and who was making critical decisions on his behalf.\" Recalling the Oversight Committee’s previous attempts to subpoena these staffers, Comer said that \"the Biden White House blocked these individuals from providing testimony.\" Now, he said that \"any continued obstruction will be met with swift and decisive action.\" If the staffers and physician do not honor his request, Comer said the \"next step\" will be issuing subpoenas, compelling them to testify.

    "article_text": "High school athlete Katie McGuinness joins 'America Reports' to discuss placing second in a long jump event while competing against a transgender athlete. EXCLUSIVE:California'strack and field state championshipwill be an epicenter for political tension this weekend. A family with a daughter trying to win a title is \"grateful\" to the White House taking notice but not satisfied with where things stand going into the event. President Donald Trumpcalled outthe Golden State and Gov. Gavin Newsom in a Truth Social post on Tuesday morning, threatening to cut funding to the state and even send authorities to intervene if a trans-identifying athlete competes in the girls' category at the meet. Just hours later, the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) announced it would make a slight rule change for this weekend's championship. The change allows biologically female athletes who fell just shy of qualifying for the championship behind a trans athlete a chance to compete for the title this weekend. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Katie McGuinness of La Canada High School finished seventh in the women's high jump invitational in Arcadia, Calif., on April 12, 2025.(Keith Birmingham/MediaNews Group/Pasadena Star-News via Getty Images) Meanwhile, La Canada High School star Katie McGuinness looks to compete for the girls' long jump championship after qualifying automatically last weekend. But McGuinness has so far only managed to finish behind the trans athlete at postseason events this year, including the sectional final on May 17, when she finished second to her Jurupa Valley opponent. The McGuinness family addressed the president's intervention in the situation in an exclusive statement to Fox News Digital. \"We are grateful that President Trump is fighting for female athletes and giving them a fair shot to compete on a level playing field. CIF's ‘solution’ to this situation, which allows additional girls to compete at the state championship who otherwise didn't qualify because the transgender athlete took their spot, isn't good enough – it's still an unfair competition and an injustice to the girls competing,\" the family said in a statement. \"Allowing biological males to compete in women’s sports is unfair, unjust and defies common sense,\" the family added. Katie previously spoke out against CIF for allowing the situation to get this far in an interview on Fox News' \"America Reports\" last week. \"I have nothing against this athlete as a person, and I have nothing against the trans community,\" McGuinness said. \"My message today is really specifically to CIF and for them to act quickly and in a timely manner, because this is a really time-sensitive issue.\" The La Canada star also recounted the experience of facing the athlete and facing apparent \"genetic\" disadvantages in a high-stakes high school competition. \"I remember thinking to myself, ‘OK, I need to get a big jump,’\" McGuinness said.

That was it. And I was honestly very discouraged, and I'm a high school senior, and winning CIF has always been a goal of mine, and I wasn't able to compete with someone who was genetically different than me.\" She made her overall stance on the issue clear. \"There are just certain genetic advantages that biological males have that biological girls don't,\" she said. \"Frankly, I just can't stand for that.\" The trans athlete has dominated the girls' postseason this year in the triple jump and long jump and is set to compete for the state title on Saturday. The athlete competes for Jurupa Valley High School in Riverside County, California, a community that has been rocked by multiple controversies involving trans athletes, including a lawsuit involving a separate situation at Martin Luther King High School. The CIF is already under a federal Title IX investigation by the U.S. Department of Education. After Trump signed the No Men's in Women's Sports executive order on Feb. 5, the CIF was one of the first high school sports leagues in the country to announce it would not follow the order but instead comply withCalifornia's state law. Trans athletes have been allowed to compete as women and girls since 2014, when a law called AB 1266 went into effect after passing in 2013. The state legislature failed to pass two bills that would reverse this policy on April 1, despite the testimony of multiple female athletes and their families in California who have been affected by the issue. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Newsom addressed the issue during an episode of his podcast in early March. \"Well, I think it's an issue of fairness,\" Newsom told guest conservative influencer Charlie Kirk. \"I completely agree with you on that. It's deeply unfair. \"So that's easy to call out the unfairness of that. There's also a humility and a grace … these poor people are more likely to commit suicide, have anxiety and depression, and the way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with as well.\" Newsom's office has since provided a statement supporting the CIF's decision to amend its eligibility policy for the championship event this weekend.

(@OPRArgentina via X) U.S. Health and Human ServicesSecretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.met with Argentine President Javier Milei on Tuesday at the Casa Rosada, where both leaders reaffirmed plans to withdraw their nations from the World Health Organization (WHO) and build a new international health framework. The meeting brought together two strong-willed political outsiders. Milei, a libertarian economist known for cutting government spending, and Kennedy, a Trump-appointed health chief skeptical of pandemic-era mandates. Both promised to challenge what they call global overreach and politicized health policy. Argentina officially confirmed its exitfrom the WHO during Kennedy’s visit, following Milei’s initial announcement in February. The move aligns with President Trump’s revived pledge to pull the U.S. out of the WHO as part of his \"Make America Healthy Again\" (MAHA) agenda.FIERY RFK JR.

Both Argentina and the U.S. have reaffirmed commitments to leave the WHO after a meeting in Buenos Aires this week.(Getty Images) Milei’s government blasted the WHO for what it called a failed COVID response. \"The WHO’s prescriptions do not work because they are not based on science but on political interests and bureaucratic structures that refuse to review their own mistakes,\" the government said, referring to the group’s lockdown strategy as a \"caveman quarantine.\" Kennedy offered support, encouraging other countries to alsoexit the WHOin a recent address to the World Health Assembly. He has argued the organization is compromised by foreign governments and corporate interests, and that a fresh approach is needed. After the meeting,Kennedy posted on X: \"I had a wonderful meeting with President Milei about the mutual withdrawal of our nations from the WHO and the creation of an alternative international health system... free from totalitarian impulses, corruption, and political control.\" Both governments say the new alliance will prioritize real science, individual freedom, and national sovereignty, pushing back against what Milei’s team calls \"interference\" from global agencies.ARGENTINA'S MILEI SHUTS UP CRITICS WITH MIRACLE TURNAROUND OF ECONOMY, STRONG SECURITY POLICIES U.S. and Argentine officials meet at the Casa Rosada in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on May 27, 2025.

Milei took office vowing to slash Argentina’s massive public spending. He famously carried a chainsaw during his campaign to symbolize budget cuts—and has since followed through, cutting public salaries, halting state projects, and ending energy subsidies. His tough measures have produced results: Argentina posted its first budget surplus in nearly 15 years and sharply reduced monthly inflation. Kennedy’s MAHA campaign echoes Milei’s anti-establishment style, but in the health sector.The Trump administration’shealth agenda has focused on rolling back federal overreach, enforcing science-based policy, and promoting transparency in public health.

Milei identifies his political philosophy as libertarian.(@SecKennedy via X) Tuesday’s meeting marks a deeper alignment between Argentina and the current U.S. administration. Milei has welcomed top American officials in recent months and shown clear interest in building strong ties with Washington. Now, by joining the U.S. in rejecting the WHO, Milei becomes the first foreign leader to openly back Trump’s health sovereignty push. The decision is a major departure from Argentina’s previous international partnerships and could signal a shift for other countries weighing similar moves. Both Milei and Kennedy have framed the initiative as the start of a more accountable and independent global health network. Critics,including some in Argentina’s opposition, warn that leaving the WHO could limit access to funding and vaccines. Global health experts largely defend the WHO’s role, despite acknowledging its COVID missteps. But Milei and Kennedy appear unfazed. Argentina’s health minister praised the shared \"vision\" between the two governments, emphasizing a joint commitment to transparency and reform.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

The U.S.’s chief adversaries, Russia, North Korea and China, all of which are nuclear-armed nations, have condemned PresidentDonald Trump’sspace-based defensive plan he dubbed the \"Golden Dome\" as \"dangerous\" and a threat to global stability. The president discussed his $175 billion plan, which will use satellites and other technologies to detect and intercept a missile strike \"even if they are launched from other sides of the world,\" Trump said last week. The defensive plan, though it is believed to beyears awaybefore being fully operational despite Trump’s three-year goal mark, sparked stiff backlash from the U.S.’s top competitors, who took direct aim at what they called Trump’s \"arrogance.\" U.S. President Donald Trump makes an announcement regarding the Golden Dome missile defense shield next to U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., May 20, 2025.

But her comments were not the first time Moscow aligned its condemnation of the \"Golden Dome\" as it issued a joint statement with China earlier this month after Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping met forformal talks in Russia.

Gaomi Youdao Chemical Co. manufactures pesticides as well as chemicals for medical use, and has more than 500 employees, according to corporate registration records.

    "article_text": "Eylon Levy, a former Israeli government spokesperson, says Israel is in an \"impossible bind\" as it tries to defeat Hamas and get the remaining hostages out of Gaza. After more than a year and a half of war,Israel has founditself in an \"impossible dilemma\" as it tries to defeat Hamas and bring home the remaining hostages, former Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy says. In an interview with Fox News Digital, Levy said that it is crucial that Hamas not remain in power — and that it is also vital to save the hostages languishing in tunnels under Gaza. \"If this war ends with the Hamas regime that perpetrated October 7th still in power, it won't end, it will just pause, and the next war will be a matter of time,\" Levy said. \"Israelis don’t want war. We need this war to be over, but we need this war to be over with the total defeat of the Hamas regime, or else this won't be the last Gaza war.\" Left: Israeli military vehicles in Gaza. Right: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu(Reuters) PARENTS OF HAMAS HOSTAGES URGE TRUMP TO BE 'TOUGH WITH ENEMIES AND FRIENDS' AMID ISRAELI SIEGE IN GAZA Israel has faced international criticism over its handling of the war in Gaza, with the U.K., France and Canada releasing a joint statement earlier this month demanding that Jerusalem end its military operations in the Gaza Strip. The U.K. also suspended trade talks with Israel because of London’s objections to the war. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney of being \"on the wrong side of humanity.\" \"I think anyone criticizing Israel needs to come up with a better plan for how youremove Hamas from power, because otherwise they're just giving it political power and trying to save [it] from the war that it started,\" Levy told Fox News Digital. The international community has been pressuring Israel regarding hostage swaps. Jerusalem has been pressured to free Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the release of hostages taken on Oct. 7. Levy acknowledged that while Israel cannot leave the hostages behind, there are valid concerns about these releases. \"Israel is facing the impossible dilemma because Hamas is demanding the hostage-takers of tomorrow for the hostages of today,\" Levy said. Eylon Levy speaks at the \"International Rally - United We Bring Them Home\" rally in Hostage Square on May 18th, 2024 in Tel Aviv, Israel.(Alexi J. Rosenfeld/Getty Images) Levy also called out the international community, saying that most countries would not \"pay ransoms to terrorist hostage-takers.\" \"Here's the absurdity of international pressure on Israel to pay a ransom. Most countries don't pay ransoms to terrorist hostage takers because they understand it only incentivizes more hostage taking, it rewards it, it encourages more of it,\" Levy told Fox News Digital. \"Israel has paid a ransom to get hostages out in two cease-fires because we say we know the dangers, we know it's risky, but we've got to get out these poor people who are being starved and tortured and even executed in the dungeons.\" Levy believes Israel \"found itself stymied along the way\" as countries that initially backed efforts to defeat Hamas \"got cold feet very quickly\" as they understood what removing the terror group from power would entail. Looking at the broader picture, Levy wonders if Israel had taken on a different strategy from day one, whether the war would have ended sooner, though he admits it would have meant \"defying international pressure.\" Thousands of anti-Israel protestors fill Freedom Plaza and the surrounding streets for rally and march calling for an end to the Israel - Hamas war, in Washington, DC on Saturday, Nov. 4, 2023.(Rod Lamkey/CNP for Fox News Digital) FORMER BIDEN DIPLOMAT SAYS THERE'S 'NO QUESTION' THAT 'FREE PALESTINE' SLOGAN HAS BECOME A CALL FOR VIOLENCE \"I do wonder if that had been the strategy from the beginning—defying international pressure—then it's possible the war might have ended sooner,\" Levy said. \"But again, Israel is caught in this impossible bind because there are still hostages who are trapped in Gaza, whom Hamas is threatening to execute if the Israeli army gets anywhere near them to try to rescue them.\" This is not a new or empty threat. Several former hostages reported being threatened and said they were told that their captors would execute them if Israeli forces got close. Six other former hostages, including American-Israeli Hersh Goldberg-Polin, met this fate when they were fatally shot just before the IDF could reach them. Not all of Israel’s international counterparts have turned on the Jewish state. America’s approach to Netanyahu shifted as PresidentDonald Trumpreturned to the White House. While the Biden administration put more pressure on Netanyahu, Trump appears to support Israel doing what it must to end the war. Levy told Fox News Digital that \"Israelis definitely got the impression that the Trump administration has Israel's back and is willing to endorse any military strategy that it wants to implement, but there are also signs the Trump administration, you know, may want to wrap this up very quickly.\" President Donald Trump (left) and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (right).(Getty Images / Fox News Digital) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Since Trump’s return to the Oval Office, dozens of hostages have been freed, including American-Israelis Keith Siegel, Sagui Dekel-Chen and Edan Alexander.

GHF did not specify how many trucks of food it was dealing with but said that the supplies made it to its hubs and were being distributed throughout the Strip. The organization also said there would be more trucks arriving on Wednesday. \"As part of the ongoing efforts to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip, four aid distribution centers were established in recent weeks, in accordance with the directive of the political echelon and in close coordination with the United States,\" the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement.

Nadav Shoshani said in a video about the aid. The organization received considerable scrutiny before its distribution began, as well as a potentially major hurdle: just hours before itstarted distributing aid, the head of the organization resigned.

The trucker strikes can be even more effective if other sectors of Iran’s economy go on strike, especially the energy sector and other transportation sectors.\" Many opponents of the clerical regime want the U.S. government to take a page from former President Ronald Reagan's playbook against the now-defunct communist Poland via organized support for workers and their unions. U.S. administrations cooperated prior to thecollapse of the communist Soviet Unionwith the free American labor movement to inject democracy into trade unions in the largely closed communist societies. The core economic issues animating the work stoppage, which started on May 18 in the southern port city of Bandar Abbas, involve working conditions and reduced insurance costs.  According to the independentdiaspora news organization IranWire, the spike in insurance coincided with a downsized medical care.

    "article_text": "Călin Georgescu, who won the most votes in Romania's since-annulled presidential election votes, told Fox News Digital he believes he is being treated like President Donald Trump as he fights a ban on his candidacy in the redo election. Romanian populist Calin Georgescuannounced his retirement from politics after being barred from running in the country’s presidential election rerun this month. The decision comes after Georgescu ran for president late last year and emerged victorious in the first round of voting. However, a top Romanian court then annulled the result after allegations emerged of electoral violations and Russian interference.Georgescu was later bannedfrom participating in this month’s contest, which was won by pro-European Union candidate Nicusor Dan. \"I choose to be a passive observer of public and social life,\" the 63-year-old Georgescu said in a video posted online late Monday. \"I choose to remain outside any political party structure … I am not affiliated with any political group in any way.\" Georgescu – who ran as an independent in November – said he made his decision to take a step back following the conclusion of the presidential race, which for him indicated \"the sovereignist movement has come to a close.\" ROMANIA’S NOW-BARRED PRESIDENTIAL FRONTRUNNER CLAIMS HE IS FACING TRUMP-LIKE CHARGES Calin Georgescu, winner of the first round of last year's annulled election in Romania, arrives at a polling station in the second round of the country's presidential election redo in Mogosoaia, Romania, on May 18.(AP/Andreea Alexandru) \"Even though this political chapter has ended, I am convinced that the values and ideals we fought for together remain steadfast,\" he added. \"My dear ones, I have always said that we would make history, not politics.\" In February, prosecutors opened criminal proceedings against Georgescu, accusing him of incitement to undermine the constitutional order, election campaign funding abuses, and founding or supporting fascist, racist, xenophobic, or antisemitic organizations, among other charges. On Tuesday, he was due to appear at the prosecutor's office in Bucharest. Despite what appeared to be a sprawling social media campaign promoting him, Georgescu had declared zero campaign spending in last year’s contest. A Romanian court then made the unprecedented move to annul the election. \"This December, Romania straight up canceled the results of a presidential election based on the flimsy suspicions of an intelligence agency and enormous pressure from its continental neighbors,\" Vice President JD Vancesaid in a speechat the Munich Security Conference in February.

You can believe it's wrong for Russia to buy social media advertisements to influence your elections. We certainly do. You can condemn it on the world stage even. But if your democracy can be destroyed with a few hundred thousand dollars of digital advertising from a foreign country, then it wasn't very strong to begin with,\"Vanceadded. Georgescu sparked controversy for describing Romanian fascist and nationalist leaders from the 1930s and 1940s as national heroes, according to the Associated Press. He has also praised Russian President Vladimir Putin in the past as \"a man who loves his country\" and has questioned Ukraine’s statehood, but he claims not to be pro-Russian. Georgescu has argued the election was \"canceled illegally and unconstitutionally,\" and after he was barred from the May rerun, he accused the authorities of \"inventing evidence to justify the theft\" of the elections.

    "article_text": "King Charles and his wife, Queen Camilla, arrive in Canada, welcomed by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. (via Reuters) King Charles IIIarrived in Canada on Monday for a symbolic visit showing support for the country, which recognizes him as its sovereign, amid U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to acquire the North American nation as the 51st U.S. state. Charles and his wife Queen Camilla landed at Ottawa Airport in Ontario, where the king met on the tarmac with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Governor General Mary Simon, the king's representative in Canada. The king later held separate meetings with Carney and Simon. Charles, 76, has kept a limited schedule while undergoing cancer treatment. His two-trip to Canada signals a strong commitment to the country, which is one of 15 nations where he is monarch. This is Charles' first visit to the former British colony since becoming king in September 2022.

Carney invited Charles to Canada after Trump repeatedly suggested he wanted to annex the country, an idea fiercely rebuked by the prime minister, who secured an election win last month in part due to Canadians' disapproval of Trump's wish to make the country part of the U.S. \"The prime minister has made it clear that Canada is not for sale now, is not for sale ever,\" Canada's envoy to the U.K., Ralph Goodale, told reporters during a visit last week by Charles toCanada's high commissionin London.

    "title": "Liberals blame Big Beautiful Bill loss on dying Dems: Imagine if they 'retired instead of died in office'",
    "article_text": "'America's Newsroom' co-anchor Bill Hemmer provides details on Rep. Gerry Connolly's, D-Va., congressional career. Facing yet another loss after the Trump-backed \"Big, Beautiful Bill\" advanced in Congress, liberals are lashing out at Democratic Party elders for clinging on to power too long — even to death. Shortly before the so-called BBB went up for a vote, Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., a longtime leader inthe Democratic Partyfrom deep-blue Fairfax County, passed away after a battle with esophageal cancer. Connolly had previously indicated he would be retiring at the end of his term in 2026. In response, many liberal analysts and consultants complained that too many Democrats were refusing to leave office, including FIGHT Agency's Rebecca Katz, who posted on X, \"Imagine if one of the older and sicker Dems would’ve retired instead of died in office and what that would’ve meant for millions of people,\" quoting a post of the final 215-214 tally. Below that was a repost of a story with a large image of Connolly that described recent elderly Democrats who have died in office. WHITE HOUSE: DEMS HAVE 'NEVER BEEN MORE RADICAL, OUT OF TOUCH' AFTER VOTING AGAINST 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' President Joe Biden, left, Rep. Gerald Connolly, right(Getty) When reached for comment, Katz told Fox News Digital that \"no individual has a divine right to rule for eternity.\" \"Democratic votersfeel lied toand are demanding accountability, and our party needs to earn back their trust and start winning again. We shouldn't be afraid to have hard conversations,\" Katz said. The story — in the left-wingNew Republic— described how Connolly was the latest in a recent string of Democrats who have died in office, including Reps. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., and Sylvester Turner, D-Texas. According to her X profile, Katz has experience in Arizona politics working with Sen. Ruben Gallego's campaign, as well as previously Sens. Harry Reid, D-Nev., John Fetterman, D-Pa., and Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y. Meanwhile, the last eight lawmakers to have died in federal office have all been Democrats — including Turner's own predecessor Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, for whom he took over for less than a term. The New Republic appeared to lay the blame for the BBB's narrow win at the feet of dead Democrats. \"House Republicans managed to pass their draconian budget bill, which promises to make massive cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, and food assistance, early Thursday morning by a narrow one-vote margin that was only possible due the deaths of three in this current Congress,\" the New Republic's Hafiz Rashid wrote, describing Connolly, Grijalva and Turner. WINNERS, LOSERS AND GRAB-BAGS FROM HOUSE GOP’S NARROW PASSAGE OF ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’ Quoting another article fromThe Nation, Katz wrote: \"In a democracy, politicians exist to serve the public; the public does not exist to serve politicians. It’s a sign of democratic decline if politicians live and die like warlords, clinging to every last ounce of power. Democrats need to define what they stand for as a party so their elected officials can once more be genuine public servants and not mere warlords.\" The Nation lamented how Democrats are supposed to be a political movement seeking to gain power and implement an agenda. But, \"in practice… [they] more closely resemble a hospice, if not a funeral home,\" it went on, pivoting to criticizing the party for its bolstering of former President Joe Biden amid revelations from CNN anchor Jake Tapper's book on the alleged \"cover-up [of] his infirmity.\" The three Democrats who died within close proximity to BBB negotiations all hailed from reliably Democratic districts in Fairfax, Tucson and Houston, and could have had their seats filled by Democrats if they had retired in a timely fashion. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Senior House Republican leadership staff emphasized that Connolly's absence would not have had any bearing on the outcome of the votes. Johnson had 217 votes on-hand, Fox News learned Tuesday. Prior to Connolly, Turner and Grijalva, Democrats from similarly-secure Paterson, New Jersey; Houston oncemore; Newark, New Jersey; California (Sen. Dianne Feinstein); and Petersburg, Virginia, died in office and left their party in the statistical lurch. Currently, the four oldest sitting federal lawmakers are Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, at 91, Reps. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., and Hal Rogers, R-Ky., at 87, and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., at 87. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., is 85.

    "article_text": "Fox News State Department correspondent Gillian Turner breaks down the highlights of State Secretary Marco Rubio's tense Senate hearing on 'Special Report.' The State Department is planning to bolster its efforts to vet and screen the social media of those applying for international student and exchange visitor visas to ensure applicants don’t pose a national security threat to the U.S., Fox News Digital has learned. To do this, the State Department is temporarily suspending new student and exchange visitor visa interviews as it evaluates enhanced social media screenings for the application process. The effort is the latest initiative from the Trump administration to crack down on immigration and revoke visas of those attending academic institutions in the U.S. Those who’ve publicly supportedPalestine have faced increased scrutiny, and Secretary of StateMarco Rubiosaid in May that the administration was reviewing the visa status of students who participated in pro-Palestine protests. The Trump administration has accused students who’ve participated in these protests of supporting Hamas — a designated foreign terrorist organization. The State Department is currently examining existing operations that go into screening and vetting student and exchange visa applications, and \"based on that review, plans to issue guidance on expanded social media vetting for all such applicants,\" according to a Tuesday email obtained by Fox News Digital. TRUMP ADMIN STEPS UP OVERHAUL OF NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, WEEKS AFTER WALTZ'S DEPARTURE Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in May that the administration was reviewing the visa status of students who participated in pro-Palestine protests.(Jose Luis Magana/The Associated Press ) As a result, the State Department is instructing consular sections to pause adding any additional student or exchange visitor visa appointment capacity until further guidance is issued, \"in preparation for an expansion of required social media screening and vetting,\" the email said. \"The next step is for posts to evaluate operations and processes in preparation for this expanded social media vetting of all student and exchange visitor (F, M, J) visa applicants,\" said the email. \"Appointments already scheduled can proceed under current guidelines,\" the email said. \"However, appointments that are available, but not taken as of the release of this cable, should be immediately removed from availability.\" RUBIO FIRES BACK AFTER DEM SENATOR SAYS HE REGRETS VOTING FOR HIM, SPARKING TENSE EXCHANGE The State Department is instructing consular sections to pause adding any additional student or exchange visitor visa appointment capacity until further guidance is issued, \"in preparation for an expansion of required social media screening and vetting,\" the email said.(Celal Gunes/Anadolu Agency) The email does not specify what additional steps would be involved in the more stringent social media screening process, but says that consular offices have been instructed to refer certain student and exchange visitor visa applicants to the Fraud Prevention Unit for a \"mandatory social media check.\" The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital on what the existing social media policy is for applicants. Meanwhile, Rubio told lawmakers May 20 that he expects that the State Department has already pulled thousands of visas since January following PresidentDonald Trump’sinauguration. That’s up from the 300 the administration had revoked as of late March. Rubio also said that his agency would continue to pull student visas, stating that a visa is not a right, it’s a \"privilege.\" \"I don't know the latest count, but we probably have more to do,\" Rubio told lawmakers on the Senate appropriations subcommittee overseeing foreign affairs. \"We're going to continue to revoke the visas of people who are here as guests and are disrupting our higher education facilities.\" Meanwhile, Democrats have said that the Trump administration's effort to revoke visas is a violation of due process. \"I do think it's a fundamental attack on freedom, because due process is the guardian of the gate to keep a government from taking away people's life or liberty, and liberty is what happens when you take away a visa without due process,\" Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., told Rubio May 20. A student visa allows those outside the U.S. to study in the country for a specific amount of time at an academic institution. In contrast, a green card allows an individual already in the U.S. who is not an American citizen to remain in the country.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP One of the executive orders instructs the State Department, as well as the Department of Homeland Security, the attorney general, and the director of national intelligence, to \"vet and screen to the maximum degree possible all aliens who intend to be admitted, enter, or are already inside the United States, particularly those aliens coming from regions or nations with identified security risks.\" Additionally, the other executive order states that the U.S. will use \"all available and appropriate legal tools, to prosecute, remove, or otherwise hold to account the perpetrators of unlawful anti-Semitic harassment and violence.\" Diana Stancy is a politics reporter with Fox News Digital covering theWhite House.",

    "article_text": "Fox News chief legal correspondent Shannon Bream breaks down two major rulings from the Supreme Court on 'Special Report.' The Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to intervene and allow it to quickly deport illegal immigrants to countries other than their own, Fox News has learned. The request from theJustice Departmentcomes after a lower-court judge, Brian Murphy, issued an injunction last month that halted the Trump administration's attempts to rapidly deport immigrants residing illegally in the United States to third-party countries not their own. In the ruling, Murphy said the Trump administration must provide \"meaningful\" notice to immigrants it wishes to deport to third-party countries, so they have adequate time to challenge their deportation. The Justice Department's request follows a separate Monday evening ruling from Murphy, rejecting the Trump administration's request that his injunction be lifted, in order for deportations to continue while the merits of his ruling are adjudicated. Due to Murphy's rejection, the Trump administration sought emergency relief from theSupreme Court, asking it to upend the injunction itself. UPENDING US BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP WOULD HAVE DRASTIC NEGATIVE IMPACT, DEFENDERS WARN This split shows President Donald Trump and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.(AP) At the center of the Trump administration's request for relief from Murphy's injunction are as many as a dozen people from various countries, including Vietnam and Myanmar, who were allegedly ordered deported to South Sudan in violation of Murphy's earlier order. Last week, Murphy ordered that the migrants remain in U.S. custody at a military base in Djibouti until each of them could be given a \"reasonable fear interview,\" or a chance to explain to U.S. officials any fear of persecution or torture, should they be released into South Sudanese custody. As of Monday night, these interviews had not taken place, according to Murphy. The US Supreme Court’s may determine as early as Monday whether former President Donald Trump may be kicked off Colorado's state primary ballot for allegedly interfering in the 2020 election.(Fox News) US JUDGE ACCUSES TRUMP ADMIN OF ‘MANUFACTURING CHAOS’ IN SOUTH SUDAN DEPORTATIONS, ESCALATING FEUD It was unclear where the plane carrying the migrants may be as of last week, but a source with knowledge of the situation confirmed to Fox News that the flight was in the nearby African country of Djibouti, withU-S militarypersonnel on the scene assisting. No word on when or if the flight would travel on to South Sudan. ADepartment of Homeland Securityspokeswoman had indicated South Sudan would not be the final destination for that particular flight. Reacting to Murphy's ruling last week halting the deportation of illegal immigrants to South Sudan,President Donald Trumpcalled on the Supreme Court to \"put an END\" to judges getting in the way of his immigration enforcement efforts.

Tuberville joined Fox News as he stood in front of his family and friends at an Auburn barbecue restaurant. The move by the former longtime college football coach — who spent 10 years as head coach at Auburn University in Alabama — ended weeks of speculation about his ambitions to run for governor in his homestate. TUBERVILLE SPOTLIGHTS TRUMP IN EFFORT TO SAVE COLLEGE SPORTS Just a week ago, Fox News confirmed that Tuberville told donors at recent private meetings that he would be launching a gubernatorial campaign. And a source familiar told Fox News a couple of weeks ago that an endorsement from Trump would be a \"done deal\" if Tuberville decided to run for governor.

    "title": "US judge accuses Trump admin of ‘manufacturing chaos’ in South Sudan deportations, escalating feud",
    "article_text": "'Fox & Friends' co-hosts tout President Donald Trump's immigration policy after the Border Patrol's San Diego Sector reported a 186% drop in illegal border crossings compared to Mar. of 2024. A federal judge in Massachusetts chastised seniorTrump officialsMonday night for failing to comply with his court orders after a group of migrants was deported from the U.S. to South Sudan — the latest dust-up centered on deportations, due process protections and the administration’s willingness, or lack thereof, to comply with federal courts. In a scathing, 17-page order, U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy rejected Trump’s request to amend or withdraw the judge's earlier decisionrequiring them to keep in U.S. custodysix migrants who were deported to South Sudan without due process or notice. On Wednesday, Murphy ordered that the migrants remain in U.S. custody at a military base in Djibouti until each of them could be given a \"reasonable fear interview,\" or a chance to explain to U.S. officials any fear of persecution or torture, should they be released into South Sudanese custody. As of Monday night, he said, these interviews had not taken place. SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS TRUMP'S REMOVAL OF BIDEN APPOINTEES FROM FEDERAL BOARDS Demonstrators protest during a May Day demonstration against President Donald Trump and his immigration policies in Denver, May 1, 2025.(Jason Connolly/AFP) \"It turns out that having immigration proceedings on another continent is harder and more logistically cumbersome than defendants anticipated,\" Murphy said in his order, noting that the Trump administration is free to return individuals to have the interviews carried out on U.S. soil. He also took aim at Trump officials for attacking the courts, noting Monday night that defendants here have \"mischaracterized\" the court's order, \"while at the same time manufacturing the very chaos they decry.\" The salvo comes as Murphy, a federal judge in Boston,presides over a class-action lawsuitfrom migrants who are challenging deportations to third countries, including South Sudan, El Salvador and other countries, including Costa Rica, Guatemala and others that the administration has reportedly eyed in its ongoing wave of deportations. In considering the third-country removals, Murphy stressed that he has attempted to strike a delicate balance between due process protections under the U.S. Constitution and the Trump administration's wave of eleventh-hour removals and deportations. Murphy noted that he allowed the Trump administration to keep the six deported migrants in South Sudan under the custody of U.S. officials, so long as they carry out the so-called \"reasonable fear interviews,\" and make a determination over whether the migrants' concerns were adequate. FEDERAL JUDGES IN NEW YORK AND TEXAS BLOCK TRUMP DEPORTATIONS AFTER SCOTUS RULING U.S. judges have repeatedly ruled that the Trump administration has violated due process by failing to notify the migrants of their imminent removals.(Getty Images) \"The court never said that defendants had to convert their foreign military base into an immigration facility,\" Murphywrote in his orderMonday night. \"It only left that as an option, again, at defendants’ request.\" Murphy also doubled down on his earlier orders as \"sensible and conservative,\" noting that he had repeatedly attempted to strike the right balance in weighing the Trump administration's requests for the men to remain in South Sudan against their right to habeas proceedings and due process under the U.S. Constitution. He also cited DOJ's seemingly fluid position as to what constitutes adequate notice for removals. He said Justice Department attorneys previously told the court that they believe that 24 hours is sufficient and meaningful notice to remove certain migrants, before breaking with that in removing the men to South Sudan. These individuals also do not appear to have any access to counsel. In one case, he said, plaintiffs declared Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials had canceled at least one prerescheduled meeting with an attorney and her client. \"Class members likewise had no opportunity to learn anything about South Sudan, a nascent, unstable country to which the United States has recently told its citizens not to travel because of crime, kidnapping, and armed conflict,\" Murphy said. 'WOEFULLY INSUFFICIENT': US JUDGE REAMS TRUMP ADMIN FOR DAYS-LATE DEPORTATION INFO The judge's order is the latest attempt by federal court judges to rein in the Trump administration as it continues to deport migrants to third countries, including El Salvador and South Sudan.(Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images) The judge's order is the latest attempt by federal courts judges to rein in the Trump administration as it continues to deport migrants to third countries, including El Salvador and South Sudan. U.S. judges have repeatedly ruled that the Trump administration has violated due process by failing to notify the migrants of their imminent removals, or afford them any opportunity to challenge their deportations in court— a view reiterated, albeit narrowly, by the Supreme Court four separate times since Trump took office. The judges have repeatedly ordered the Trump administration to facilitate their return to the U.S. To date, the Trump administration has not complied publicly with any of the requests to return the deported individuals. White House officials, meanwhile, have blasted so-called \"activist\" judges as attempting to enact a political agenda, and have repeatedly rejected the notion that illegal immigrants are not entitled to due process. APPEALS COURT BLOCKS TRUMP ADMIN'S DEPORTATION FLIGHTS IN ALIEN ENEMIES ACT IMMIGRATION SUIT President Donald Trump took aim at what he described as \"USA hating judges\" in a Truth Social post May 26, 2025, arguing that they \"suffer from an ideology that is sick and very dangerous for our country.\"(Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) Trump took aim at what he described as \"USA hating judges\" in a Truth Social post Monday, arguing that they \"suffer from an ideology that is sick and very dangerous for our country.\" Earlier, he described Murphy as yet another \"activist judge\" who he said is trying to protect \"criminal illegal immigrant monsters.\" \"The court recognizes that the class members at issue here have criminal histories,\" Murphy wrote in an apparent response to these comments Monday night. \"But that does not change due process,\" he wrote. \"The court treats its obligation to these principles with the seriousness that anyone committed to the rule of law should understand.\" Murphy added in his order that the Trump administration is welcome to submit its arguments to the court in writing. But he noted, \"From this course of conduct, it is hard to come to any conclusion other than that Defendants invite lack of clarity as a means of evasion.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As of Monday, he said, this step had not been completed.

A federal judge on Tuesday temporarily halted the Trump administration's effort to killNew York City's controversial congestion pricing program. U.S. District Court Judge Lewis Liman issued a temporary restraining order barring the administration from getting rid of the program and withholding federal funding if the city failed to nix the program. NEW YORK CITY URGES JUDGE TO BLOCK TRUMP ADMINISTRATION FROM ELIMINATING ITS CONGESTION PRICING PROGRAM On Tuesday, a federal judge temporarily halted the Trump administration's effort to kill New York City's controversial congestion pricing program.(Bebeto Matthews/AP Photo) Liman’s Tuesday restraining order keeps the tolls in place through at least June 9 and prevents Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy from retaliating against the city. \"The judge’s ruling today was not on the merits of our case against Hochul’s class warfare, but rather a temporary pause to have more time to reach a decision,\" a Department of Transportation spokesperson said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"Enforcement actions for noncompliance were merely under consideration, and we will comply with the judge’s request to hold.\" \"We look forward to making our case in court against (New York Gov. Kathy) Hochul’s illegal tolls as we work to protect working-class Americans from being unfairly charged to go to work, see their families, or visit the city,\" the statement continued. In February, Trump posted an image of himself wearing a crown and wrote, \"CONGESTION PRICING IS DEAD. Manhattan, and all of New York, is SAVED. LONG LIVE THE KING!\" Fox News Digital has reached out to theWhite Housefor comment. The program was launched in January, using electronic license plate readers and charging most drivers a $9 toll during peak periods to enter Manhattan south of 60th Street in an attempt to reduce congestion and raise funds to improve mass transit.

    "article_text": "Alex Thompson, co-author of the Biden expose 'Original Sin,' said on 'Fox News Sunday' that aides surrounding the former president rationalized doing 'undemocratic' things to keep Biden's cognitive decline hidden and Donald Trump out of power. Alex Thompson, co-author of the recently released exposé on formerPresident Joe Biden,told Fox News Sunday that top aides ‘rationalized’ doing ‘undemocratic’ things to hide the president's cognitive decline, because failing to do so would have been too beneficial to Donald Trump. During an interview with \"Fox News Sunday's\" Shannon Bream,Thompson was asked whether any officials close to Biden, such as his cabinet secretaries, expressed remorse for their potential complicity in covering up Biden's health. \"There was definitely a lot of self-reflection about what — if anything — they should have done differently,\" Thompson said. \"I think there was a feeling — like a lot of members of the Democratic Party that were seeing this, or saw moments of [Biden] seeming out of it — that going public wasn't going to change his mind. It was only going to helpDonald Trump. And I think that's how a lot of them rationalized it.\" AXIOS' ALEX THOMPSON CALLS DONALD TRUMP'S HEALTH 'FAIR GAME' AFTER BEING 'UNTRANSPARENT' ABOUT RECORDS Alex Thompson, co-author of the new Biden expose, said through his reporting he found that aides seemed to be willing to do 'undemocratic' things in order to hide Biden's cognitive decline, fearing that not doing so would be helpful for Donald Trump.(FOX NEWS SUNDAY) \"Now, whether or not history will judge them as being right for doing that, we will see. But this is also part of the reason why the White House was shielding [Biden] from as many people as possible, including cabinet secretaries.\" Bream went on to question Thompson about an aide he spoke to who said Biden \"just had to win and then could disappear\" because Biden's \"aides could pick up the slack.\" Bream described the quote as essentially \"admitting\" Biden shouldn't be running again. EX-DNC CHAIR CALLS BOOK'S CLAIM THAT BIDEN DIDN'T RECOGNIZE HIM A 'BOLD FACED LIE' In a letter sent Tuesday to officials of both the Alabama Democratic Party and the Democratic National Committee (DNC), Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen, a Republican, said their party's national convention is scheduled to occur past the deadline for certifying a presidential candidate in Alabama.(Paul Morigi/Getty Images for Care Can't Wait Action) \"Who would have been running the White House in a second Biden term?\" Bream asked Thompson. \"Well, this person went on to say, 'When you're voting for president, you're voting for the aides around him.' But these aides were not even Senate confirmed aides - these were White House aides, these were unelected people.\" Thompson replied. \"One of the things that really comes out in our reporting here is that if you believe — and I do think a lot of these people do sincerely believe that Donald Trump was and is an existential threat to democracy — you can rationalize anything, including sometimes doing undemocratic things — which I think is what this person was talking about.\" Alex Thompson (LEFT) and Joe Biden (RIGHT).(Screenshot/C-SPAN | Alex Brandon/AP Photo | Leah Millis/Reuters) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Thompson and CNN's Jake Tapper have been doing the rounds discussing and promoting their new book titled \"Original Sin,\" which has garnered a lot of attention for detailing what critics have said shows Biden's cognitive decline while he was in theWhite Housewas even worse than most people suspected.

DEM IMMIGRATION TALKING POINTS FIZZLE AS DARK PICTURE OF ABREGO GARCIA EMERGES Ivey, who said he did not use taxpayer money to fund his trip, said he had arranged with embassies in the U.S. and in El Salvador to meet Abrego Garcia in prison but was met with bureaucratic hurdles when he got there. Ivey said he was told he had to obtain a permit at a location 90 minutes away, which blocked his plans. \"And I won't tell you what I said, but I mean, it's ridiculous that an international delegation would get that kind of treatment, especially when we're making this kind of request,\" Ivey said. WATCH: Democrat Rep. Glenn Ivey fumes he was not allowed access to Kilmar Abrego Garcia He didn’t say if he attempted to get a permit but added that locals also told them no one—not even families—were getting permits to visit loved ones in detention. \"It was a clear run around and not a way that a foreign government should be treating the Congress of the United States,\" he said. Ivey said he wanted to see Abrego Garcia to confirm the detainee’s condition, location and ensure he receives due process in U.S. courts. Several other Democrats, including Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, have rushed to meet with Abrego Garcia and decried what they said was a lack of due process extended to him. Maryland Sen.

So it was kind of a runaround.\" In a video posted to X on Monday, Ivey wrote that he traveled to the Central American country to visit his \"constituent\" and called on the government there to \"cut the crap.\" Abrego Garcia was sent in March to El Salvador's notoriously high-security prison equipped to handle violent gang members, known as CECOT, which sparked Van Hollen to lead the surge of Democrats traveling there.The Trump administrationhas repeatedly cited court and police documents showing that the El Salvadoran man was not only in the U.S. illegally, but also connected to the MS-13 gang and that his wife had sounded the alarm to police about his violence.

    "article_text": "Political strategist Tiffany Marie Brannon weighs in on Sen. Michael Bennet’s ‘furious’ message to the Democratic Party for losing to President Trump. Democratsare spending $20 million on a study examining how to speak to \"American men\" after losing ground with the demographic during the 2024 election cycle, The New York Times revealed. \"Speaking with American Men: A Strategic Plan\" is a $20 million project crafted by Democrats to \"study the syntax, language and content that gains attention and virality in these spaces\" of male voters, theTimes reportedSunday. Known as \"SAM,\" the study will specifically examine young male voters and how the party can connect with the demographic. Additionally, the study advised rolling out pro-Democrat ads in video games. The study's revelation was made in an overarching article detailing the uphill battle Democrats face after the 2024 election, which included Democrats scrambling to replace former PresidentJoe Bidenas the nominee with just more than 100 days left in the election cycle and ultimately delivering all seven battleground states to PresidentDonald Trump. \"The Democratic Party’s tarnished image could not come at a more inopportune moment,\" the article detailed. \"In this era of political polarization, the national party’s brand is more important and influential than ever, often driving the outcomes of even the most local of races.\" DEMOCRATIC PARTY SCRAMBLES TO FIX IMAGE AS MEMBERS ACKNOWLEDGE PARTY 'LOST CREDIBILITY' Democrats are searching for a path forward after President Donald Trump's election win.(AP Images) In response, Democrat operatives and donors have gathered at swank hotels to craft plans on how to draw back the working class and male voters, the Times reported. Trump made big in-roads with the male vote during the 2024election cycle. A Fox News Voter Survey published in November 2024 found that men aged 18–44 supported Trump at 53%, compared to former Vice PresidentKamala Harris’ 45%. While The Associated Press found that more than half of male voters under the age of 30 voted for Trump instead of Harris — including roughly six-in-10 White male voters supporting Trump — about one-third of Black male voters supported Trump, as did about 50% of young Latino male voters. Trump's support among young Black and Latino male voters jumped by about 20% compared to his 2020 support, the AP reported. Democratic strategist Michael Ceraso told Fox News Digital on Tuesday that he does not take issue with Democrats investing in voter engagement strategies but added that he found it \"hilarious\" that \"people in suits are hanging out at luxury hotels asking how they can talk to day-to-day Americans.\" \"We're having an issue with the messenger more than the message,\" Ceraso said, arguing that voters support longstanding Democratic policies such as affordable housing, but that \"Democrats just need to take a reality check\" on how they convey their messaging to voters. \"I just don't understand how, after all these years and all these Democrats who've been in the game, how we continue to make those same choices,\" he added. \"Like Rahm Emmanuel, or all these sort of big names, they're just like, 'Yeah, we're going to figure out how to win in, you know, rural North Carolina by hanging out in a New York hotel.' That makes no sense to me. And strategically, I don't care how much money you spend on focus groups, if you're doing that, you're just negating any type of investment you're putting into how to have a conversation with voters.\" Democrats are reportedly spending millions on a study examining American men in an effort to win back voters.(Getty Images) Democrats spending millions studying American male \"syntax\" sparked condemnation from conservatives and Democrats alike on social media, Fox News Digital found.

They’re citizens.\" Chief political analyst at the Liberal Patriot,Michael Baharaeen,posted to X, \"This really says it all,\" in response to a tweet quoting the article regarding how \"Democratic donors and strategists have been gathering at luxury hotels to discuss how to win back working-class voters, commissioning new projects that can read like anthropological studies of people from faraway places.\" President Donald Trump made in-roads with young male voters during the 2024 election cycle.(Paul Bersebach/MediaNews Group/Orange County Register via Getty Images) \"The fact that Democrats need to drop $20 million just to figure out how to speak to American men tells you everything you need to know.

    "article_text": "California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom is proposing to reign in some aspects of offering Medicaid to illegal immigrants in the state, as Republicans and Democrats in the legislature have starkly different views on the policy overall. TheRepublican minority leaders in Californiaare responding to potential next steps for the highly scrutinized Medi-Cal program, which is insolvent, as some believe the ability for people to enroll \"regardless of their immigration status\" is a leading cause. The state faces a $12 billion budget shortfall as budget talks continue in Sacramento. The Medi-Cal program went insolvent earlier this year after it went billions over budget, resulting in $3.44 billion in loan requests to salvage the program, which covers low-income Golden State residents. Republicans said it was in large part due to illegal immigrants being allowed to enroll in the program, and Newsom also said that it was part of the spending issue, but not the whole picture, according toKCRA.

Gavin Newsom’s May budget revision proposes a pause in adults 19 and older from enrolling in \"full-scope coverage.\"(AP Photo/José Luis Villegas, File) \"That’s going to continue to be a big debate here in California as we're wrestling with a $12 billion dollar deficit and the cost of providing free healthcare to illegal immigrants is $11.4 billion dollars, so if we just didn't do that, that would eliminate our budget deficit,\" California State Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones said. \"Now, there's lots of other ways we can find $12 billion dollars to eliminate the deficit as well.\" Newsom’s May budget revision proposes a pause for adults 19 and older from enrolling in \"full-scope coverage\" and to start charging a $100 premium each month \"for individuals with certain statuses,\"Fox News Digitalreported earlier this month. \"To be very clear, these proposals are the results of a $16 billion Trump Slump and higher-than-expected health care utilization. Because of these outside factors, the state must take difficult but necessary steps to ensure fiscal stability and preserve the long-term viability of Medi-Cal for all Californians,\" Elana Ross, deputy communications director for Newsom's office, told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"Governor Newsom refuses to turn his back on hardworking Californians, especially when it comes to their basic health care needs,\" she added. The proposal from the Newsom administration sparked criticism among some in the legislature, as the Democratic California Legislative Latino Caucus is suggesting a tax hike to pay for the program’s coverage for illegal immigrants, according toKCRA. The question remains whether a $100 premium would be enough to getpeople to leave the program.

It's not an actual thing. Meaning the governor and the Democrat leadership are promising illegal immigrants coverage, and they are on the rolls, but there's very little access,\" he said. \"A lot of doctors in California that used to provide Medicare and Medicaid have closed up shop, moved to other states. A lot of other doctors that are still here have stopped taking those kinds of patients, even if they're here legally or illegally, because the reimbursement rates are so low, the doctors actually lose money when they take a Medicare or Medicaid patient,\" Jones continued.

And everybody said it's gonna be billions of dollars. It's not sustainable. And at the time, Biden was president, and people were coming across the border, millions of people. We had no idea. And I think a lot of them came to California and signed up. And so now we have a completely unsustainable, bankrupted Medi-Cal system that's required $3.4 billion worth of loans to prop up.\" On a federal level, the pending reconciliation bill that recently passed the House of Representatives could also create issues for the state’s Medi-Cal offerings, as it would change the federal \"match\" from 90% to 80% for care that is not an emergency, which the Newsom administration says could cost the state billions,The Center Squarereported. \"If Republicans move this extreme MAGA proposal forward, millions will lose coverage, hospitals will close, and safety nets could collapse under the weight,\" Newsom stated last week.

    "title": "Trump ramps up heat on Harvard: Here are 5 reasons from the university's own investigation",
    "article_text": "Constitutional law attorney Jonathan Turley discusses the latest escalation in President Donald Trump's feud with Harvard The Trump administration escalated its war with Harvard University on Tuesday, announcing it will claw back the university's remaining $100 million in federal funding — effectively ending all financial ties with the Ivy League institution. \"The government is out of business with Harvard University, fully,\" a senior administration official told Fox News Digital. At the center of the fight are accusations of Harvard failing to combat a campus culture of antisemitism. While the university accuses the White House of overreach and insists it is defending free speech, its own internal investigation appears to have handed Trump officials ammunition. Earlier this year,Harvard PresidentAlan Gerber called the 2023–2024 academic year\"disappointing and painful\"as he unveiled the results of two separate task forces: one examining antisemitism and the other focused on anti-Muslim and anti-Arab bias. The report from the antisemitism task force painted a bleak picture of life for Jewish and Israeli students on campus. Many said they felt ostracized, harassed online and unsupported by the university. Some students told investigators they had been pressured by peers, and even the faculty, to disavow ties to Israel to prove they were \"one of the good ones.\" Others chose tohide their Jewish identityaltogether. Here is a look back at more findings of the report, released April 29. Jewish, Arab and Muslim students at Harvard reported feeling ostracized, pushed to the margins by their peers and experiencing online harassment. Jewish and Israeli students told the antisemitism task force the university’s response to complaints was \"unclear and unconscionably slow.\" Some Jewish students, according to the report, had been told by peers and even faculty members they were associated with \"something offensive, and, in some cases, that their very presence was an offense.\" Some decided to conceal their identities from classmates, while others were asked to renounce anyties to Israelto prove they were \"one of the good ones.\" TRUMP SAYS HARVARD'S FOREIGN STUDENTS ARE FROM COUNTRIES PAYING 'NOTHING' FOR THEIR EDUCATION \"No other group was constantly told that their history was a sham, that they or their co-religionists or co-ethnics were supremacists and oppressors, and that they had no right to the protections offered by anti-bias norms,\" read one section of the report. \"Many Jewish students told us they feel like objects of suspicion.\" Harvard President Alan Gerber called the 2023–2024 academic year \"disappointing and painful.\"(Craig F. Walker/The Boston Globe via Getty Images) One Jewish graduate student told the task force, \"Jews are now being treated like Republicans were when I was in college.\" That statement \"of course points to another problem with which elite universities have been struggling,\" the report said. At times, the anti-Muslim and antisemitism task force reports were seemingly at odds with each other. Muslim and pro-Palestinian students reported a widespread fear of doxxing, or having their personal identifying information shared publicly with the intent to intimidate or harm them. They reported often seeing pictures of their faces on the sides of trucks driven around campus by pro-Israel groups. Forty-seven percent of Muslim students reported feeling physically unsafe on campus during the 2023–2024 school year, compared with 15% of Jewish respondents. The antisemitism report called for a set of rules to govern permissible behaviors for instructors in classrooms, while the anti-Muslim and Arab bias task force called for the university to do more to protect academic freedom and free speech. JUDGE TEMPORARILY PAUSES TRUMP MOVE TO CANCEL HARVARD STUDENT VISA POLICY AFTER LAWSUIT The antisemitism report found Harvard classes often portrayed \"partisan and one-sided pedagogy\" that failed to account for Jewish and Israeli perspectives, particularly within the university's divinity school and school of public health. The task force also documented instances when faculty canceled or ended class early on the day of a pro-Gaza protest or \"gave time at the end of class for students to promote various solidarity groups\" like the Palestine Solidarity Committee. The report recommended expanding courses on antisemitism, Judaism and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to foster a more inclusive and comprehensive academic environment. \"Anti-Zionist views seem built into some classes,\" one student noted. Fox News Digital has reached out to Harvard for comment on the report. In the 1980s and 1990s, the report found that at the university \"pro-Israel organizers and pro-Palestinian organizers had disagreed strongly yet often worked together to build bridges and to imagine jointly a better future for the region.\" \"Those efforts started to fade in the 2000s amidst the Second Intifada and through the Israel-Hamas wars of the 2010s, and by the time Hamas crashed through the Israeli border fence in 2023 the conditions at Harvard (as in the Middle East itself) were very different,\" the report read. Some pro-Palestinian campus organizers viewed bridge-building activities \"as a form of betrayal,\" the report found. Some pro-Palestinian campus organizers viewed bridge-building activities \"as a form of betrayal,\" the report found.(Anibal Martel/Anadolu via Getty Images) The report found that many students, including Jewish ones, had \"sympathy\" for Israel’s \"massive military response\" that followed the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel. However, campus protests \"crossed a line from a call for freedom and security for Palestinians and Jews alike to a stereotyped notion: that Israel is not a state, but rather a ‘settler colony’ of white Europeans who have no real connection with the land they had stolen, that epitomized aggression, and was bereft of virtues.\" The report found that changes in Harvard’s admissions policies meant that by 2023, the Jewish student community was much smaller than it was in the early 2010s. The hostility that some students had felt, the report found, was \"degrading\" to the university, and some Jewish students turned down offers of admission to Harvard over it. Some Jewish students vying for doctorate degrees said they decided to leave for private industry jobs because of the perception that academia is \"unfriendly to Jews.\" Some non-Jewish faculty members told the task force that Jewish candidates had turned down post-doctoral fellowships at Harvard and Jewish medical school students shied away from residencies at Harvard hospitals \"because of the deep politicization of the climate.\" The task force determined Harvard should change its admissions policy to reflect \"what campus should look like: people listening to each other.\" Pro-Gaza protests have persisted on Harvard's campus since Israel's offensive campaign to eradicate Hamas began after Oct. 7, 2023.(Pat Greenhouse/The Boston Globe via Getty Images) The task force also found a lack of oversight over seemingly university-endorsed educational content. The Harvard Chan School of Public Health, for example, launched a Palestinian program in 2022 that is run by a \"leadership collective\" of five individuals, none of whom hold a tenure-track faculty appointment at Harvard. \"The use of the Harvard brand for a research or teaching project creates expectations among Harvard faculty, staff, students, and the broader public. Programs operating without the guidance and oversight of Harvard’s regular faculty with expertise risk falling short of these expectations,\" the task force found. In another example, the task force found the coursework for a master's degree in Religion and Public Life to be misrepresented. The program is advertised as offering students a better understanding of religion to illuminate a range of contemporary issues. Both faculty and students did not expect the program to be as focused on the Israel–Palestinian issue as it was, and some students found \"program offerings and materials disproportionately presented Israelis and Jews as guilty of monstrous historical crimes, which require both repentance and redress.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The program \"appears to have focused on non-mainstream Jewish religious perspectives that lack widespread support within the Jewish diaspora or in Israel.\" It also linked Jews to \"two great sins,\" according to the task force: the creation of the state of Israel and participation in White supremacy, which staff\"appeared to embrace openly.\"",

    "article_text": "Fox News Digital spoke to Alabama State Auditor Andrew Sorrell about his personal experience being debanked and what states can do to stop it in the future EXCLUSIVE:Protecting Americans from being \"debanked\" has been a top priority for the State Financial Officers Foundation, and Fox News Digital spoke to a member of that organization, who said he was targeted himself, about the importance of that pursuit. \"When I was initially debanked, I didn't realize I was getting debanked,\" Alabama Republican State Auditor Andrew Sorrell told Fox News Digital at the State Financial Officers Foundation conference in Orlando, Florida. \"What happened was I just get a letter one day from our credit card company, from my gun store, Gold Guns and Guitars, and we get this curious letter in the mail, and it says that in 30 days, we're closing your account. And it didn't tell us why at all.\" Sorrell, 39, explained that at first he thought that his company had simply forgotten to pay their bills, but when he realized he was up-to-date, he switched credit card companies and did not think anything of it until he got another letter from his credit card processor notifying him he was being dropped. RED STATE TREASURER REVEALS WHY STATE FINANCIAL OFFICERS HAVE 'OBLIGATION' TO COMBAT ESG, DEI Fox News Digital spoke to Alabama State Auditor Andrew Sorrell about his experience of being \"debanked.\"(Fox News/iStock) \"So we're doing about 2 million dollars in revenue, about a million and a half of that is done by credit card or debit card transactions, and I was really confused this time, because why would a credit card processor drop us?\" Sorrell explained. After that, Sorrell was told by his insurance company he was being dropped with \"no explanation.\" \"I called my insurance broker, and he said, ‘Oh yeah, this is happening to all gun stores,’\" Sorrell said. \"He said insurance companies are dropping all gun stores. And then it hit me. Oh my goodness, I'm a victim of political debanking. I didn't even realize that that's what was happening to me.\" Debanking is the phenomenon in which a bank customer has their accounts canceled, often with no explanation. Conservatives have long alleged that banks were unfairly targeting them in the practice, with banks specifically going after companies with conservative messaging or principles, including gun stores.

We're just following the law, we don't wanna debank people anymore,\" Sorrell said. \"This is un-American, and it has to be stopped.\" Since the Trump administration took office in January, pushing back against political debanking has become a more prevalent conversation in government, including in the form of a bill from GOP Sen.

    "article_text": "Former Michigan gubernatorial candidate Tudor Dixon sounds off on Democrats' reported $20 million plan to connect with American men, warnings against lenient grading systems in public schools and Gen Zers finding happiness in religion and family. More than six months afterthe Democratic Partysuffered major setbacks in the 2024 elections, the party is seeking a path to escape the political wilderness. Part of that effort includes a recent gathering by top party consultants and donors trying to figure out how Democrats can improve outreach to male and working-class voters. PresidentDonald Trumpwon back control of the White House while Republicans flipped the Senate and defended their fragile House majority in November, and the GOP made gains among Black and Hispanic voters, as well as younger voters – all traditional members of the Democratic Party's base. \"Everything we've done up to this point has resulted in re-electing Donald Trump,\" longtime Democratic strategist and communicator Joe Caiazzo told Fox News Digital. OPINION: WHAT DEMOCRATS NEED TO DO TO WIN AGAIN Then-Vice President Kamala Harris delivers her presidential nomination acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention on Aug. 22, 2024 in Chicago.(Fox News - Paul Steinhauser) \"If anyone tells you that we don't have to course correct, they don't know what they're talking about,\" added Caiazzo, a veteran of Sen. Bernie Sanders 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns. In the face of Trump's sweeping and controversial moves since his return to the White House in January, an increasingly angered and energized base of Democrats is pushing for party leaders to take a stronger stand in leading the resistance to the president and Republicans. The anger directed not only at Trump and Republicans, but also at fellow Democrats, appears to be a factor in the party's polling woes, with Democratic Party favorable ratings sinking to historic lows. Kamala Harris and Joe Biden at the DNC.(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) WATCH: DEMOCRATS' PARTY CHAIR MAKES CASE IN ‘FOX NEWS SUNDAY’ APPEARANCE Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chair Ken Martin vows the party will compete in all 50 states going forward. In an interview earlier this month on\"Fox News Sunday,\" Martin highlighted that the party's focus right now is \"squarely on making sure that we stand up for hardworking Americans who are being left behind in this Trump economy.\" A 2024 election DNC postmortem is currently underway, with the findings expected to be issued later this year. However, grabbing the spotlight in recent days was a gathering hosted by the Democrat-aligned super PAC Future Forward at a luxury resort along the California coast. Among the strategy discussions at the gathering was a $20 million effort titled, \"Speaking with American Men: A Strategic Plan.\" The recommendations of the effort, which is code-named SAM, included having Democrats drop what is described as a \"moralizing tone\" toward male voters, changing the party's language used toward men and purchasing more ads on video games as part of male outreach. Some former key staffers on the 2024 campaign of former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris, who replaced Biden as the party's nominee last summer, heavily criticized the effort, which was first reported by the New York Times and later confirmed by Fox News. \"Instead of studying working-class voters and men, why doesn’t the Democratic Party donor class go out and meet some? What the hell is this?\" James Singer, a spokesman for the 2024 campaign, wrote in a social media post. \"As a Democrat, it’s embarrassing.\" It was a similar message from Ammar Moussa, another veteran Democratic strategist and communicator who worked on the Biden and Harris campaigns. \"This is embarrassing. Truly,\" Moussa wrote on X. Democrats have long had a problem attracting male voters in presidential elections. Trump won the male vote by 12 points over Harris in the 2024 presidential election, and according to theFox News Voter Analysis,that margin ballooned to 15 points among men 45 and older. Fast-forward to this spring, and the Democrats' ratings stood underwater in the latest Fox News national poll at 41% favorable and 56% unfavorable in a survey conducted April 18-21. That is an all-time low for the Democrats in Fox News polling, and for the first time in a decade, the party's standing was lower thanthat of the GOP,which stood at 44% favorable and 54% unfavorable. The figures were reversed last summer, when Fox News last asked the party favorability question in one of its surveys. HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLING The Fox News poll was far from an outlier. The Democratic Party's favorable ratings were well in negative territory in a Pew Research national survey - 38% favorable, 60% unfavorable - conducted in early April and at 36% favorable, 60% unfavorable in a Wall Street Journal poll in the field a couple of weeks earlier. Additionally, national polls conducted in February by Quinnipiac University and March by CNN and by NBC News also indicated the favorable ratings for the Democratic Party sinking to all-time lows. (Fox News ) However, there is more. Confidence in the Democratic Party'scongressional leadershipalso sunk to an all-time low, according to a Gallup poll conducted early last month. The confidence rating for Democrats' leadership in Congress stood at 25% in the survey, which was nine points below the previous low of 34% recorded in 2023. The semi-annual Harvard Youth Poll, which was released late last month, indicated that approval ratings for Democrats in Congress among Americans aged 18-29 nosedived. An ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll conducted in mid-April indicated that more respondents trusted Trump (40%) than Democrats in Congress (32%) to handle the nation's main problems. Additionally, a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted late last month suggested Republicans hold a significant advantage over Democrats on two top issues: the economy and immigration. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"If Democrats want to be competitive in this country and build lasting majorities in both chambers and be competitive for the White House, we've got to broaden the tent,\" Caiazzo insisted. He lamented that Democrats have \"become hyper-focused on a certain set of issues that only speak to a certain set of people while letting the most important issues of the day fall by the wayside. Every single day, Democrats should be focused on how we make things better for working people. And the way we deliver that message has got to meet people where they are.\" Paul Steinhauser is a politics reporter based in the swing state of New Hampshire.

    "article_text": "Attorney General Pam Bondi details a DEA operation where 11.5 kilos of fentanyl, including approximately 3 million pills, were seized. A Los Angeles Countywoman, who served on a presidential advisory committee under the Biden administration and has an extensive history of donating to Democrats, reached a plea agreement with the Department of Justice (DOJ) for making tens of thousands of dollars in illegal campaign contributions to reportedly secure a seat on the Kennedy Center Board of Trustees, the DOJ announced Wednesday. Teena Maria Hostovich, 66, was charged Wednesday with making contributions in the name of another aggregating to more than $10,000 in a year, which is a felony, the DOJ reported. She revealed in her plea agreement that she carried out the scheme in part to secure a spot on the Kennedy Center's Board of Trustees, the DOJ stated in the press release. The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts serves as the national cultural center of the U.S. and is located in Washington, D.C. Hostovich is an insurance broker who used the identities of 11 other people, including co-workers and family members of co-workers, to illegally contribute more than $75,000 to political candidates between 2020 and 2023, the DOJ stated in a press release. DOGE SAYS IT'S REFERRED DOZENS OF POTENTIAL VOTER FRAUD CASES TO DOJ Teena Hostovich at a Hollywood, California, event in 2015.(Getty Images) \"According to her plea agreement, from May 2020 through 2023, Hostovich knowingly and willfully made a total of $75,700 in contributions to federal candidates’ principal campaign committees and federal joint fundraising committees in the names of other people,\" theDOJ saidin a press release. \"For the calendar years 2021 through 2023, Hostovich’s conduit contributions aggregated to more than $10,000 during each of those years.\" Hostovich agreed in a court filing Wednesday to plead guilty to the federal criminal charge and pay a $43,500 fine. Her scheme included contacting co-workers, their family members and other people \"who performed personal services for Hostovich and her family\" to ask them to make a donation to apolitical campaignor fundraising committee, according to the press release. She would then use PayPal to reimburse the individual for the contribution or pay them up front before the contribution was made, the Justice Department explained. STACEY ABRAMS-FOUNDED GROUPS SLAPPED WITH HISTORIC FINE FOR CAMPAIGN FINANCE VIOLATIONS \"To execute these conduit contributions, Hostovich sometimes explicitly stated that she would advance the money for the contribution or pay the person back for that contribution,\" the press release outlined. \"Other times, the person had an implicit understanding that Hostovich would advance the money or reimburse them based on her history of advancements and reimbursements of political contributions. Hostovich generally advanced or reimbursed these individuals in amounts that exceeded the exact contribution amount but often the amounts were very close to the contribution amount.\" The Department of Justice announced a plea deal with a California woman accused of carrying out a conduit political donation scheme.(Kevin Lamarque/Reuters) Fox News Digital reviewed a website promoting a book Hostovich wrote in 2024 on climbing America's corporate ladder, which also touted Hostovich as a member of the Clinton Global Initiative, and that former PresidentJoe Bidenappointed her to serve on the President’s Advisory Committee on the Arts. \"She is a member of theClinton Global Initiativeand the White House Historical Association. President Biden recently appointed her to the President’s Advisory Committee for the Arts, and she is the Co-Chair of the Advisory Council to the Kennedy Center’s President and Chairman,\" the bio states, which is accompanied by photos of Hostovich with high-profile Democrats such as Hillary Clinton, former President Bill Clinton and Biden. Fox News Digital reached out to the Clinton Foundation for comment but did not immediately receive a reply. An archived official White House press release from 2023 under the Biden administration detailed Hostovich's position on the President’s Advisory Committee on the Arts, including touting her \"corporate governance responsibility, political activism, and philanthropic work.\" \"She has combined her lifelong passion for the arts, history, and education with her corporate governance responsibility, political activism, and philanthropic work,\" thebio states. \"In addition to serving on the Board of the Los Angeles Philharmonic for over a decade, she has been one of the Chairs (along with her husband and son) of Hollywood Bowl Opening Night many times (including 2023) honoring significant artists and showcasing the LA music community while raising money for Music Matters benefitting music/arts programs in public schools.\" It is unclear how donations made in other people's names would bolster her reported efforts to secure a spot on the Kennedy Center Board of Trustees. The president appoints general trustees to the board, while other members are appointed by Congress. CALIFORNIA WOMAN AND MAN CHARGED WITH ALLEGEDLY STEALING OVER $2 MILLION IN ILLEGAL COVID RELIEF FUNDS A representative for Hostovich told Fox News Digital in an emailed statement Tuesday morning that \"Teena Hostovich has agreed to plead guilty to one count of making contributions in the name of another, involving five donations of $2,900 each in 2021. In doing so, she is accepting responsibility for her conduct early and swiftly.\" The statement continued that Hostovich's \"mistakes are out of character,\" arguing that her \"career, accomplishments, and numerous charitable deeds reflect a lifetime of hard work and generosity.\" \"Her generosity and commitment to her community led to her involvement in donating and fundraising for causes and candidates that she believed would champion fairness, equality, and improve society,\" the spokesperson continued. \"She deeply regrets that her ardent support of some candidates led to lapses in judgment in a fraction of the donations she helped to raise and make. She is even more remorseful for the shadow that this investigation may cast on the candidates to whom the donations were made, as they had no knowledge of any wrongdoing.\" \"Throughout this process, Ms. Hostovich has cooperated fully and worked transparently with law enforcement authorities. She is committed to making the appropriate amends.\" A spokesperson said that Teena Hostovich's \"mistakes are out of character,\" arguing that her \"career, accomplishments, and numerous charitable deeds reflect a lifetime of hard work and generosity.\"(iStock) The DOJ did not identify in its press release which political party Hostovich favored, though Federal Election Commission (FEC) records reviewed by Fox News show Hostovich made hundreds of donations across the years toDemocrat politicians, the Democratic Party and left-wing political action committees. Hostovich has nearly 1,000 entries on the FEC's database regarding donations she made under her own name stretching back to 2008 through the 2024 election cycle. The FEC data shows she donated to campaigns and groups such as the Obama Victory Fund, Democratic Party of Virginia, Pasadena, California, area United Democratic Headquarters and Chris Coons for Delaware during the 2008–2012 period. More recent data from the 2024 election cycle shows she donated to groups such as the North Carolina Democratic Party – Federal, the Wyoming Democratic State Central Committee, the Pennsylvania Democratic Party and the Democratic State Committee (Delaware). Searching for donations made to groups or campaigns containing the name \"Republican\" or \"GOP\" yielded zero results, Fox News Digital found. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The FBI carried out an investigation into Hostovich before she was charged and reached a plea agreement, the DOJ said. The DOJ told Fox Digital on Tuesday that Hostovich is scheduled to appear in court on June 13 in Los Angeles.",

    "article_text": "Rep. Buddy Carter's Senate campaign is releasing this video targeting Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff for his stance on transgender issues. FIRST ON FOX:House Rep. Buddy Carter, R-Ga., is taking aim at Georgia's senior senator in a new ad highlighting thevulnerable Democrat'sstance on transgender student athletes. Carter, who is running for Senate, is releasing a 30-second advertisement titled, \"Ossoff Fan,\" which features a purported transgender woman complaining about Carter's own Republican stances. It opens by showing a transgender woman, played by a stubble-chinned biological male wearing a wig and a dress, sitting in a living room beside a dumbbell watching Carter on Fox News. \"He's been MAGA from the beginning,\" the person says on the phone. \"He's been loyal to Trump, defended him during impeachment.\" The person on the other line says, \"And Buddy helped Trump at the border with deportations.\" HOUSE GOP TARGETS ANOTHER DEM OFFICIAL ACCUSED OF BLOCKING ICE AMID DELANEY HALL FALLOUT Sen. Jon Ossoff is being targeted over his stance on transgender issues in a new ad by House Rep. Buddy Carter.(AP Photo/Buddy Carter For Senate) The transgender person picks up a trophy and says, \"And preventing people like me from competing in women's sports. Buddy Carter even believes there's only two genders.\" \"Now Buddy wants to help Trump in the Senate and beat Jon Ossoff,\" the individual says. \"It's just not fair.\" Meanwhile, the voice on the phone quips, \"After all Ossoff has done for us!\" The ad ends with the transgender person picking up a sign with pink lettering that says, \"Ossoff for Senate,\" putting on a pair of wedge sandals, and stomping to their car. The short but punchy advertisement signals that Republicans still believe the debate surrounding transgender inclusion is a potent issue for turning out voters in favor of the GOP. It proved to be a key issue in the 2024 general election, with moderate Democrats spending weeks after the fact decrying their own party's intolerance to differing views. Ossoff is a first-term lawmaker who was the first Democrat to win a Senate seat in the Peach State in roughly two decades. Republicans now view Ossoff’s seat as one of the most viable flip opportunities in the upcoming 2026 midterm cycle, when the GOP hopes to keep and expand upon its thin majority in the upper chamber. The ad is meant to depict a transgender woman complaining about Rep. Buddy Carter's pro-Trump stances.(Buddy Carter For Senate) Carter was the first Republican to jump into the contest after Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who was considered a heavy favorite to run against Ossoff, opted to forgo a Senate bid. Georgia Insurance Commissioner John King is also running in the race as a Republican. Ossoff joined with all other Democratic senators to filibuster the bill from Sens. Tommy Tuberville and Katie Britt, both Alabama Republicans, in March, effectively killing the legislation after it advanced out of the House earlier this year. Their bill, called the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act, is designed to bar transgender athletes from participating in federally funded school athletics at all levels, from elementary school to college. It would amend Title IX to make it a violation for any school athletic program that receives federal funding to allow a biological male to participate in sports or activities that are meant for women or girls, and defines a person’s sex by their reproductive biology and genetics at birth.

Jon Ossoff.(Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call via Getty Images) The measure is similar to anexecutive orderfrom PresidentDonald Trumpin February that argued that the participation of biological men in women's and girls' sports was \"demeaning, unfair, and dangerous to women and girls, and denies women and girls the equal opportunity to participate and excel in competitive sports.\" Ossoff campaign communications director Ellie Dougherty argued in a statement after this report was published that athletic associations and local school districts could ensure fair and safe competition in school athletics, and accused the GOP's bill of threatening to usher in \"extremely intrusive\" federal investigations of children's bodies. \"American parents don't need federal bureaucrats confirming our children's genitalia,\" Dougherty said.

Former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel appears to be teasing a 2028 presidential run, urging reforms to a Democratic Party he described as \"weak and woke\" in an interview withthe Wall Street Journal. Emanuel blasted the currentDemocratic platformas \"toxic,\" arguing party leaders need to get back to basics rather than getting dragged into unpopular cultural debates. Emanuel is one of many names in Democratic circles who has been floated as a potential 2028 candidate, alongside Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and former Transportation Sec. Pete Buttigieg. \"If you want the country to give you the keys to the car, somebody’s got to be articulating an agenda that’s fighting for America, not just fighting Trump,\" Emanuel said. \"The American dream has become unaffordable. It’s inaccessible. And that has to be unacceptable to us.\" Emanuel recently returned to the U.S. after serving as U.S. ambassador to Japan under President Joe Biden's administration. In addition to serving as Chicago mayor, Emanuel also worked as President Barack Obama's White House chief of staff and served in Congress representing Illinois.

So far, no Democrats have openly declared their intentions to run for president in 2028, though several have toyed with the idea. Walz told reporters that he would do \"whatever it takes\" to run if he is \"asked to serve.\" Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has said he would run for president if he is \"asked to serve.\"(AP/Steve Helber) Similarly, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear has said he \"would consider\" a White House bid.

TheSupreme Courtdeclined to hear a case involving a Massachusetts student who was banned from school for wearing a shirt criticizing the transgender movement on Tuesday. The student,Liam Morrison,brought the case through his father and stepmother, Christopher and Susan Morrison. The plaintiffs argue Nichols Middle School violated his free speech rights when it banned him from wearing two T-shirts to school with the words \"There are only two genders\" and \"There are [censored] genders\" on the front. Liam was sent home both times after he refused to change shirts. The school argued the shirts made his classmates feel unsafe, and a federal court agreed, saying the message was demeaning for transgender students.

    "title": "'The Kamala Excuse': Tensions between Biden and Harris plagued their campaigns, new book reveals",
    "article_text": "Senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy provides details on the request for former President Biden's inner circle to testify on the concealment of his decline. 'Fox & Friends' co-hosts react. Former Vice PresidentKamala Harrishad 107 days to convince the American people to elect her the next president. Tension between Harris' team and former PresidentJoe Biden's inner circle did not do her any favors, a new book by CNN anchor Jake Tapper and Axios political correspondent Alex Thompson reveals. \"Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again,\" has returned questions about Biden's cognitive decline and his administration's alleged cover-up to the national conversation. The book also pulls back the curtain on the complicated relationship between Biden and Harris, spotlighting the distrust that had been brewing between their teams since Biden tapped Harris as his running mate in 2020. NEW BOOK REVEALS BIDEN'S INNER CIRCLE WORRIED ABOUT HIS AGE YEARS BEFORE BOTCHED DEBATE PERFORMANCE Former Vice President Kamala Harris watches as former President Joe Biden speaks to members of the media at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, on Thursday, Aug. 1, 2024.(en Cedeno/UPI/Bloomberg via Getty Images) The choice for Biden's vice president came down to Harris or Gov.Gretchen Whitmer, D-Mich., according to Thompson and Tapper. NEW BOOK EXPOSES HOW TOP BIDEN COMMS STAFFER WAS 'TIP OF THE SPEAR' COVERING UP BIDEN'S COGNITIVE DECLINE \"Many on the Biden team felt that Harris didn't put in the work and was also just not a very nice person. Several quietly expressed buyer's remorse: They should have picked Whitmer.\" To Biden's 2020 presidential campaign, Whitmer represented the \"next generation of Biden Democrats,\" Thompson and Tapper said. Additionally, former first lady Jill Biden resented Harrisafter hitting him hardduring the first Democratic primary in 2019 for opposing the Department of Education's busing program to integrate public schools. \"That little girl was me,\" Harris said on the debate stage. Former President Joe Biden shared an image of him and his wife Jill on Monday after it was announced he was diagnosed with prostate cancer.(X/JoeBiden) \"Still, Biden's advisers did not fully trust her. Harris and her advisers felt it. Her aides got the impression that doing more than the bare minium to help was considered an act of disloyalty to Biden,\" Tapper and Thompson said of Harris' involvement in the 2020 campaign. \"Some of that culture carried over into the White House.\" Biden privately called Harris a \"work in progress\" and was not confident she could beat then-former President Donald Trump in 2024. However, Harris' team thought building up the vice president should have been a priority for Biden's transitional presidency as a \"bridge\" for the next generation of Democratic leadership, as he said back in 2020. Former President Joe Biden reacts after his wife Jill Biden defended his record on \"The View.\"(ABC / Screenshot) An excerpt of the book reads, \"In the eyes of Harris's team, the Biden White House was setting her up to fail. They gave her assignments her team considered politically toxic, such as dealing with the migration crisis, rarely offered to help, and knifed her to reporters along the way. Harris's camp didn't understand the hostility and the reluctance to offer her opportunities to shine.\" TheFox News Voter Analysisin 2024 found that 52% of voters said Trump was the better candidate to handle immigration, while just 36% said Harris. Additionally, it was a top issue for voters, with 20% saying it was the most important issue facing the country. Harrisfaced the brunt of criticismfor the surge in border crossings during the Biden-Harris administration as the Trump campaign trolled her as the \"border czar.\" When Biden dropped out of the race after his disastrous debate performance in summer 2024, Harris inherited his struggling campaign, and her old boss soon became a \"liability.\" Then-Vice President Kamala Harris speaks at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.(David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images) \"From the beginning of her campaign in July to the August weeks of picking a running mate, presiding over the convention, rolling out wave after wave of ads, and on through September debate prep, it was clear that Biden was a liability,\" Tapper and Thompson wrote. Harris was caught in the crosshairs of Biden's relentless gaffes and missteps as she tried to walk a fine line between loyalty to Biden and distancing herself from his failing campaign, as the journalists described. While Harris had \"great affection for Joe,\" her loyalty fired back when she told \"The View\" she would not have done anything differently than Biden as president. \"There is not a thing that comes to mind,\" Harris said – aninstant attack adfor the Trump administration as they highlighted the Biden-Harris administration's record on immigration, the withdrawal from Afghanistan and inflation. Then-President Joe Biden, right, and then-President-elect Donald Trump meet in the Oval Office of the White House on Wednesday, Nov. 13, 2024 in Washington, D.C.(AP) \"What is he doing?\" Harris asked her team after Bidendonned a Trump 2024 hatat a 9/11 memorial gathering at the Shanksville Fire Station, less than a month before the election. \"This is completely unhelpful. And so unnecessary,\" Harris told her team, according to the book. \"That would be, the Harris campaign decided, the last time she would do a public event with the president before the election.\" However, Biden still wanted a role in the campaign, Tapper and Thompson said, as he saw former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama speaking at rallies on the campaign trail. \"He didn't seem to understand what a liability he had become.\" Then-President Joe Biden reacts as supporters greet him with a light display showing Georgians' love for Biden at his debate watch party at Hyatt Regency Atlanta on June 27, 2024 in Atlanta.(Derek White/Getty Images for DNC) When one of Trump's supporters called Puerto Rico a \"floating island of garbage\" during a Madison Square Garden rally about a week before the election, what should have been a political layup for Democrats, became another mess for Harris to clean up. \"The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters,\" Bidensaid on a Voto Latino Zoomcall. While Biden was creating a political mess for Harris to clean up, Trump seized the opportunity to claim the narrative, sporting a high-visibility vest at a rally in battleground Michigan and hosting an impromptu press gaggle from the front seat of a garbage truck that was decked out in Trump decals. \"By the end of the campaign, she had helped the Democratic Party, but her own candidacy was barely treading water. And the albatross that was Joe Biden kept getting heavier,\" Tapper and Thompson said.

    "article_text": "Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel discusses the CDC reporting a six-fold increase in whooping cough cases on ‘Special Report.’ While cases of measles continue to spread throughout the U.S., Hawaii is reporting a new type ofinfectious spread. Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is on the rise at a \"worrying rate\" inthe Aloha State,the State of Hawaii Department of Health (DOH) confirmed last week in a news release. As of May 15, there have been 108 cases of pertussis reported, already exceeding the 84 total cases in 2024. CDC REMOVES COVID VACCINE RECOMMENDATION FOR HEALTHY CHILDREN AND PREGNANT WOMEN The DOH labeled pertussis a \"highly contagiousrespiratory disease\" that spreads through the air when an infected individual coughs or sneezes. Symptoms often resemble a cold but can progress to \"intense coughing fits.\" Pertussis complications can include pneumonia, seizures, apnea, encephalopathy and death.(iStock) For children,these coughing fits can be followed by a \"deep breath\" that makes a \"whooping\" sound. \"Health complications can be serious and even life-threatening, especially for infants and young children who are not fully vaccinated,\" the DOH warned. Complications can include pneumonia, seizures, apnea, encephalopathy (adisease of the brain) and death. DOCTORS WARN OF ‘TRIFECTA’ OF CHRONIC ILLNESSES PLAGUING AMERICANS AFTER MAHA REPORT The most effective way to prevent pertussis isthrough vaccination, according to the DOH. The DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis) vaccine is administered to children under 7 years old and the Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis) vaccine is for older children and adults. Multiple doses are generally recommended for infants, children and adults. Hawaii has fallen below national averages in terms of childhood vaccinations, data shows.(iStock) \"High vaccination rates protect individuals and communities and prevent cases frombecoming outbreaks,\" the agency noted. \"However, vaccination rates for all routinely recommended vaccinations for school entry – including those for measles, pertussis, polio and varicella (chickenpox) – have declined nationally and in Hawaii since 2019.\" MEASLES OUTBREAKS EMERGE ACROSS US: SEE WHICH STATES HAVE REPORTED CASES Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel confirmed that Hawaii is below the national average in terms of childhood vaccines, noting that the DTaP vaccine is \"highly effective\" in children, with close to 100% protection with appropriate dosages. \"Pertussis is insidious, and can be easily mistaken for otherrespiratory diseases, including viruses,\" Siegel told Fox News Digital. Children should receive the DTaP vaccine in five doses, starting at two months, with a booster at 4 to 6 years old, doctors suggest.(iStock) \"Pertussis, which is a bacteria, can betreated with antibioticslike doxycycline but is easily missed. The best protection is vaccination, including repeated boosters in teens and adults.\" Siegel explained that the \"characteristic whoop\" sound among children is caused by clogged airways that are not yet well-developed. IS MMR VACCINE SAFE FOR KIDS? DR. NICOLE SAPHIER ADDRESSES CONCERNS AS MEASLES CASES RISE About one-third of babies under 1 year who contract whooping cough are at risk of hospitalization, according to the doctor. \"The best protection is for everyone around them to be vaccinated,\" he said. \"Pertussis outbreaks are now connected to a drop-off in early childhood vaccination.\" \"Pertussis outbreaks are now connected to a drop-off in early childhood vaccination.\" Neha Pathak, MD, WebMD chief physician editor, echoed that pertussis is \"still a significant publichealth threat,\" especially for infants and people with weakened immune systems. \"The DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis) vaccine offers strong protection to children — about 98 out of 100 children are protected for at least a year after the fifth dose, and about 70% are still protected for up to five years,\" she said in an interview with Fox News Digital. For adolescents and adults, the Tdap vaccine is given as a booster that offers 85% protection, \"significantly reducing the spread,\" according to an expert.(iStock) While vaccines likemeasles, mumps and rubella(MMR) can provide lifelong protection, pertussis immunity decreases over time, which means boosters are necessary for adolescents and adults, Pathak noted. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER \"The uptick in pertussis cases is concerning, but not surprising given what we are seeing with vaccine hesitancy,\" she commented. \"Pregnant womenshould also get the Tdap vaccine during their third trimester to pass antibodies to their newborns, protecting them before they can be vaccinated,\" the doctor suggested. The Hawaii DOH stressed its \"strong\" recommendation for children and adults to stay up to date with recommended vaccinations for disease prevention.(iStock) Hawaii confirmed two cases of measles in early April and concluded there was no further community spread. Despite the current situation being under control, the health department warned thatmeasles exposureis still a threat among travelers.

Wearable heart rate monitors and sports watches can be used to trackheart ratewhile working out, and many cardiovascular fitness machines also calculate it.

    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Channing Crowder, aformer NFL playerwho now co-hosts \"The Pivot\" with Ryan Clark, apologized for comments he made about Jordon Hudson regarding Bill Belichick's interview on the podcast last week. One of Belichick's stops among his book tour was on an episode of \"The Pivot,\" but Crowder said Hudson\"choreographed the open\"of the interview, which included Belichick's accomplishments as both a coach and author. Crowder also said Hudson \"just lurks\" and \"has her paws on the situation.\" But inTuesday's editionof the podcast, Crowder walked back his comments and said he had also apologized to Belichick personally.

I got caught up in the narrative, caught up in the questioning,\" Crowder said. \"When somebody sees that you have talked to a football God, now they want to ask the questions that they’ve had on their minds for years. And I would say that’s what I got caught up in. \"And I just want to tell Bill, Jordon, I apologize for any negativity it brought to you. Coach, we talked on the phone. I told you I respect you as much as I do anybody in this world. And what happened and the articles that came out was unrealistic, and that’s the opposite of what I wanted to do for you and what I wanted to do for your relationship, Coach. So that’s my bad, and I wanted to put it out there as a man. My bad, Coach.\" Clark also added that \"some of the things\" written about Hudson's potential involvement are \"not the truth.\" \"Bill reached out to me personally, and we decided that we were going to ask about the book. But I asked, ‘Hey Coach, can we get into a little bit more?'\" Clark said, adding that Hudson was even asked questions on camera, but they did not make the final cut.

But \"Jordon wanted to be represented a certain way. Jordon wanted their relationship to be represented a certain way. So did Bill.\" \"The conversations we had after [the interview], which was before the show was released, was, ‘What can we show about Bill speaking about her? And the rest of our interview,'\" Clark said. \"So for people to sit around and say that it was choreographed a certain way because Jordon was hovering, that’s not true. She was gone during that part. \"She was sitting when Bill and I were together. She actually interviewed while Bill and I were together. It was the three of us sitting around, having a conversation that was filmed that we just didn’t release. And so I think the narrative that people want to build around her and her control wasn’t displayed during our interview.\" Hudson previously received flak for her involvement in one of Belichick's interviews with CBS. According to reports, Hudson interrupted the CBS interview several times and even stormed off at one point, delaying the interview by around 30 minutes. Belichick released a statement saying he was \"surprised\" about getting the questions about his relationship and that when Hudson had stepped in, she had been doing her job. He went on to accuse CBS of creating a \"false narrative\" with so-called \"selectively edited clips.\" CBS responded, disagreeing with Belichick’s version of events.

    "article_text": "XX-XY Athletics founder Jennifer Sey joins ‘Fox & Friends’ to discuss her experience protecting women's sports after a California transgender athlete won a spot in the high track and field state championship. California's track and field state championship is getting a last-minute tweak in its eligibility rules after PresidentDonald Trumpcalled out a transgender athlete controversy that's rocking the Golden State. TheCalifornia Interscholastic Federation(CIF) provided a statement to Fox News Digital on Tuesday, just hours after Trump sent a Truth Social post threatening to withhold federal funding from the state, announcing the change. The competition will now include biologically female athletes that missed out on qualifying for the competition that may have placed higher were it not for a trans athlete's participation. The federation claims it came to the decision at the end of this past weekend's CIF Masters Qualifiers round, days before Trump's statement. The statement also refers to the female competitors as \"biological female student-athlete.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM California girls' track and field athletes protest trans inclusion in girls' sports at a postseason meet at Yorba Linda High School on Saturday, May 10, 2025(Courtesy of Sophia Lorey) \"The CIF values all of our student-athletes and we will continue to uphold our mission of providing students with the opportunity to belong, connect, and compete while complying with California law and Education Code. With this in mind, the CIF will be implementing a pilot entry process for the 2025 CIF State Track and Field Championships,\" the statement read. \"Under this pilot entry process, any biological female student-athlete who would have earned the next qualifying mark for one of their Section's automatic qualifying entries in the CIF State meet, and did not achieve the CIF State at-large mark in the finals at their Section meet, was extended an opportunity to participate in the 2025 CIF State Track and Field Championships. The CIF believes this pilot entry process achieves the participation opportunities we seek to afford our student-athletes.\" This change will result in at least two competitors qualifying to compete for the state title after falling just shy of the typical qualification threshold on Saturday. A trans-identified athlete competing as a girl for Jurupa Valley High School took first place in the triple jump and long jump on Saturday. Trump did not identify the name of the school or athlete involved in the situation in his Truth Social post. The Jurupa Unified School district has provided a statement to Fox News Digital addressing the president's recent post.

Both state law and CIF policy currently require that students be permitted to participate in athletic teams and competitions consistent with their gender identity, irrespective of the gender listed on the pupil's records. We remain committed to following the law as written and ensuring that all students are granted the rights afforded to them in a safe and welcoming environment,\" the statement read. The office for California Governor Gavin Newsom, who previously admitted he thought biological males competing in girls' sports was \"deeply unfair,\" praised the CIF's revised policy in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"CIF's proposed pilot is a reasonable, respectful way to navigate a complex issue without compromising competitive fairness — a model worth pursuing. The Governor is encouraged by this thoughtful approach,\" the statement read. The CIF is already under a federal Title IX investigation by the U.S. Department of Education. After Trump signed the \"No Men's in Women's Sports\" executive order on Feb. 5, the CIF was one of the first high school sports leagues in the country to announce it would not follow the order, and instead comply with California's state law. The CIF came under scrutiny two weeks ago whenFox News Digital reportedthat CIF officials allegedly made girls' athletes take off their \"Protect Girls Sports\" t-shirts at a sectional qualifier. The federation acknowledged the incident to Fox News Digital. \"Per the CIF Southern Section Playoff Bulletin, all athletes must be dressed in proper, school issued, track uniforms. The student-athletes were asked to comply with this while in the on-field event area, as they were wearing said shirts over their school-issued uniform,\" the CIF said in a statement at the time. The U.S. Department of Education thensent a warningto the state over the situation via an exclusive statement to Fox News Digital on May 15 ahead of the Jurupa Valley's trans athlete competing in the sectional final. TRUMP THREATENS TO PULL FEDERAL FUNDING FROM CALIFORNIA OVER TRANS ATHLETE CONTROVERSY AT STATE CHAMPIONSHIP \"CIF’s and Jurupa Valley High School’s apparent flouting of federal civil rights law by allowing a male athlete to compete in a female California track and field [Southern Sectional Division 3 Final] this Saturday, and the alleged retaliation against the girls who are protesting this, is indefensible,\" Julie Hartman, a Department of Education spokeswoman, told Fox News Digital. \"We will not allow institutions to trample upon women’s civil rights. OCR’s investigation into CIF continues with vigor.\" After losing to the trans athlete in long jump at the sectional final, La Canada High School's Katie McGuiness urged the CIF to quickly change its policy during an interview on Fox News'\"America Reports.\" \"I have nothing against this athlete as a person and I have nothing against the trans community,\" McGuiness said. \"My message today is really specifically to CIF and for them to act quickly and in a timely manner, because this is a really time-sensitive issue.\" Trans athletes have been allowed to compete as women and girls since 2014, when a law called AB 1266 went into effect, after passing in 2013. The law has enabled several controversial incidents involving trans athletes in girls' and women's sports in the state over the last year. These include the San Jose State women's volleyball scandal that prompted a lawsuit against the school and state for restoring biological male Blaire Fleming without informing the rest of the female players, and a lawsuit against the Riverside Unified School District for giving a girls' cross-country roster spot to a trans athlete while scolding students for wearing \"Save Girls Sports\" t-shirts.

A Department of Justice lawsuit against Governor Janet Mills, multiple temporary funding pauses and a Supreme Court case involving state lawmaker Laurel Libby being censured for calling out a minor trans athlete who won a girls' pole vault competition in February, has rocked the New England state for months. But now, Trump has turned his eye to California, and the CIF is already working on accommodations to the backlash in the midst of its current spring track championship controversy.

The report details how criminals are harnessing artificial intelligence to impersonate people, automate scams, and attack security systems on a massive scale. From hijacked AI accounts and manipulated models to live video scams and data poisoning, the report paints a picture of a rapidly evolving threat landscape, one that's touching more lives than ever before.

Illustration of cybersecurity risks.(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) One of the biggest risks of using AI tools is what users accidentally share with them. A recent analysis by cybersecurity firm Check Point found that1 in every 80 AI prompts includes high-risk data, and about 1 in 13 contains sensitive information that could expose users or organizations to security or compliance risks. This data can include passwords, internal business plans, client information, or proprietary code. When shared with AI tools that are not secured, this information can be logged, intercepted, or even leaked later. AI-powered impersonation is getting more advanced every month. Criminals can now fake voices and faces convincingly in real time. In early 2024, a British engineering firm lost 20 million pounds after scammers used live deepfake video to impersonate company executives during a Zoom call. The attackers looked and sounded like trusted leaders and convinced an employee to transfer funds. Real-time video manipulation tools are now being sold on criminal forums. These tools can swap faces and mimic speech during video calls in multiple languages, making it easier for attackers to run scams across borders. Illustration of a person video conferencing on their laptop.(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) Social engineering has always been a part of cybercrime. Now, AI is automating it. Attackers no longer need to speak a victim’s language, stay online constantly, or manually write convincing messages. Tools like GoMailPro use ChatGPT to create phishing and spam emails with perfect grammar and native-sounding tone. These messages are far more convincing than the sloppy scams of the past. GoMailPro can generate thousands of unique emails, each slightly different in language and urgency, which helps them slip past spam filters. It is actively marketed on underground forums for around $500 per month, making it widely accessible to bad actors. Another tool, the X137 Telegram Console, leverages Gemini AI to monitor and respond to chat messages automatically. It can impersonate customer support agents or known contacts, carrying out real-time conversations with multiple targets at once. The replies are uncensored, fast, and customized based on the victim’s responses, giving the illusion of a human behind the screen. AI is also powering large-scalesextortion scams. These are emails that falsely claim to have compromising videos or photos and demand payment to prevent them from being shared. Instead of using the same message repeatedly, scammers now rely on AI to rewrite the threat in dozens of ways. For example, a basic line like \"Time is running out\" might be reworded as \"The hourglass is nearly empty for you,\" making the message feel more personal and urgent while also avoiding detection. By removing the need for language fluency and manual effort, these AI tools allow attackers to scale their phishing operations dramatically. Even inexperienced scammers can now run large, personalized campaigns with almost no effort. With AI tools becoming more popular, criminals are now targeting the accounts that use them. Hackers are stealing ChatGPT logins, OpenAI API keys, and other platform credentials to bypass usage limits and hide their identity. These accounts are often stolen through malware, phishing, or credential stuffing attacks. The stolen credentials are then sold in bulk on Telegram channels and underground forums. Some attackers are even using tools that can bypass multi-factor authentication and session-based security protections. These stolen accounts allow criminals to access powerful AI tools and use them for phishing, malware generation, and scam automation. WHAT TO DO IF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IS ON THE DARK WEB Illustration of a person signing into their laptop.(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) MALWARE STEALS BANK CARDS AND PASSWORDS FROM MILLIONS OF DEVICES Criminals are finding ways to bypass the safety rules built into AI models. On the dark web, attackers share techniques for jailbreaking AI so it will respond to requests that would normally be blocked. Common methods include: Some AI models can even be tricked into jailbreaking themselves. Attackers prompt the model to create input that causes it to override its own restrictions. This shows how AI systems can be manipulated in unexpected and dangerous ways. AI is now being used to build malware, phishing kits, ransomware scripts, and more. Recently, a group calledFunkSacwas identified as the leading ransomware gang using AI. Its leader admitted that at least 20% of their attacks are powered by AI. FunkSec has also used AI to help launch attacks that flood websites or services with fake traffic, making them crash or go offline. These are known as denial-of-service attacks. The group even created its own AI-powered chatbot to promote its activities and communicate with victims on its public website.. Some cybercriminals are even using AI to help with marketing and data analysis after an attack. One tool calledRhadamanthys Stealer 0.7claimed to use AI for \"text recognition\" to sound more advanced, but researchers later found it was using older technology instead. This shows how attackers use AI buzzwords to make their tools seem more advanced or trustworthy to buyers. Other tools are more advanced. One example is DarkGPT, a chatbot built specifically to sort through huge databases of stolen information. After a successful attack, scammers often end up with logs full of usernames, passwords, and other private details. Instead of sifting through this data manually, they use AI to quickly find valuable accounts they can break into, sell, or use for more targeted attacks like ransomware. Get afree scanto find out if your personal information is already out on the web Sometimes, attackers do not need to hack an AI system. Instead, they trick it by feeding it false or misleading information. This tactic is called AI poisoning, and it can cause the AI to give biased, harmful, or completely inaccurate answers. There are two main ways this happens: In 2024, attackers uploaded 100 tampered AI models to the open-source platform Hugging Face. These poisoned models looked like helpful tools, but when people used them, they could spread false information or output malicious code. A large-scale example came from a Russian propaganda group called Pravda, which published more than 3.6 million fake articles online. These articles were designed to trick AI chatbots into repeating their messages. In tests, researchers found that major AI systems echoed these false claims about 33% of the time. Illustration of a hacker at work(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) HOW SCAMMERS USE AI TOOLS TO FILE PERFECT-LOOKING TAX RETURNS IN YOUR NAME AI-powered cybercrime blends realism, speed, and scale. These scams are not just harder to detect. They are also easier to launch. Here’s how to stay protected: 1) Avoid entering sensitive data into public AI tools:Never share passwords, personal details, or confidential business information in any AI chat, even if it seems private. These inputs can sometimes be logged or misused. 2) Use strong antivirus software:AI-generated phishing emails and malware can slip past outdated security tools. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices. 3) Turn on two-factor authentication (2FA):2FAadds an extra layer of protection to your accounts, including AI platforms. It makes it much harder for attackers to break in using stolen passwords. 4) Be extra cautious with unexpected video calls or voice messages:If something feels off, even if the person seems familiar, verify before taking action. Deepfake audio and video can sound and look very real. 5) Use a personal data removal service:With AI-powered scams and deepfake attacks on the rise, criminals are increasingly relying on publicly available personal information to craft convincing impersonations or target victims with personalized phishing. By using a reputable personal data removal service, you can reduce your digital footprint on data broker sites and public databases. This makes it much harder for scammers to gather the details they need to convincingly mimic your identity or launch targeted AI-driven attacks. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.  They aren’t cheap - and neither is your privacy.  These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.  It’s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.  By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.Check out my top picks for data removal services here. 6) Consider identity theft protection:If your data is leaked through a scam, early detection is key. Identity protection services can monitor your information and alert you to suspicious activity. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number, and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.  They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft. 7) Regularly monitor your financial accounts:AI-generated phishing, malware, and account takeover attacks are now more sophisticated and widespread than ever, as highlighted in the 2025 AI Security Report. By frequently reviewing your bank and credit card statements for suspicious activity, you can catch unauthorized transactions early, often before major damage is done. Quick detection is crucial, especially since stolen credentials and financial information are now being traded and exploited at scale by cybercriminals using AI. 8) Use a secure password manager:Stolen AI accounts and credential stuffing attacks are a growing threat, with hackers using automated tools to break into accounts and sell access on the dark web. A securepassword managerhelps you create and store strong, unique passwords for every account, making it far more difficult for attackers to compromise your logins, even if some of your information is leaked or targeted by AI-driven attacks. Get more details about mybest expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here. 9) Keep your software updated:AI-generated malware and advanced phishing kits are designed to exploit vulnerabilities in outdated software. To stay ahead of these evolving threats, ensure all your devices, browsers, and applications are updated with the latest security patches.Regular updatesclose security gaps that AI-powered malware and cybercriminals are actively seeking to exploit. Cybercriminals are now using AI to power some of the most convincing and scalable attacks we’ve ever seen. From deepfake video calls and AI-generated phishing emails to stolen AI accounts and malware written by chatbots, these scams are becoming harder to detect and easier to launch. Attackers are even poisoning AI models with false information and creating fake tools that look legitimate but are designed to do harm. To stay safe, it’s more important than ever to use strong antivirus protection, enable multi-factor authentication, and avoid sharing sensitive data with AI tools you do not fully trust.

Even when you are carrying a full load of passengers or cargo, the Acticycle maintains stable and responsive handling, so you always feel in control. Four-wheeled electric vehicle.(Acticycle) Range anxiety is a thing of the past with the Acticycle. The removable batteries can be charged at home with a standard outlet, and swapping them out is quick and simple. With up to 62 miles of range per battery, most daily commutes are easily covered, and you can add a second battery for longer trips. The powerful motor delivers up to 133 pound-feet of torque, which means you can climb hills and accelerate into traffic without breaking a sweat. This kind of performance is usually reserved for much heavier and more expensive electric vehicles, but the Acticycle brings it to a whole new category. HOW SECURE IS MY PASSWORD? USE THIS TEST TO FIND OUT Four-wheeled electric vehicle.(Acticycle) City living often means making tough choices about what you can carry with you. The Acticycle makes that a non-issue. With about 6 cubic feet of storage, split between a lockable hard trunk and a roomy soft compartment, you can carry everything from groceries and work supplies to picnic gear and gym bags. The storage is designed to keep your cargo secure and balanced, so you never have to worry about tipping or losing control. Four-wheeled electric vehicle.(Acticycle) The Acticycle is not just good for your commute, it is good for the planet and your wallet.

    "title": "Chicago's Mayor Johnson is so focused on race he can't see the truth about humanity",
    "article_text": "Pastor and Project H.O.O.D. founder Corey Brooks calls out Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson for 'admitting his racism out loud and clear.' Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnsonrecently stoked the racial fires once again. I guess this is the only way he can break news these days, because he doesn’t have significant accomplishments to speak of. This time the mayor was visiting the Apostolic Church of God, located in my South Side neighborhood of Woodlawn, when he said, \"The reason I hire so many Blacks to run Chicago is because we're planet Earth's most generous race.\" This is Black supremacy, plain and simple. Like the racists of America’s past, Mayor Johnson believes in attributing supremacy and inferiority to an individual based on skin color. And he has made no secret of his belief that one’s Black skin makes one superior and one’s White skin makes one inferior. In 2022, he toldthe Chicago Tribune, \"People are going to criticize the fact that we have [the most] Black and brown folks in the history of Chicago. Yes, we are the Blackest administration, and I’m proud of it.\" And what does he say about White people? DOJ LAUNCHES INVESTIGATION INTO BLUE STATE CITY OVER ALLEGED RACE-BASED HIRING In July of 2024, he told a concert crowd that he blamed whites for running the city down to the ground: \"Y'all look, white supremacy is real- I'm going to say that one more time.\" He clearly forgot that the preceding mayor of Chicago was Black. The man has no problem admitting his racism out loud and clear. That is why I applauded the recent decision by the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division to launch an investigation into whether or not Johnson’s administration engaged in discriminatory hiring practices. Specifically, they will examine whether the city’s employment practices systematically favored black candidates over others, violating federal anti-discrimination laws. THE REAL REASON CHICAGO MAYOR BRANDON JOHNSON IS WORKING SO HARD TO RESIST TRUMP I don’t want a mayor who plays racial tribalism for power and to hide the fact that our city is suffering profoundly. That is why his comment about blacks being the most generous race on earth was offensive. If one looks at my neighborhood through a racial lens, we are 90% all Black and we have an epidemic of Black-on-Black crime. I have said time and time again that the problems we face are human problems. We are not \"Black\" but human beings born in the greatest country known to mankind and it is time that we start thinking of ourselves in that regard. In 2023, 70% of our homicides were Black-on-Black. Blacks are both the killers and the victims. How is this generous? To make matters worse, 70% of thosehomicides go unsolvedin predominantly Black neighborhoods like mine. How is this generous? I could go on about other crimes, but I think the point is made. The fact that Mayor Johnson chooses to overlook the horrors playing out on our streets every day so that he may engage in his racial fantasies reveals that we truly have no one leading our city. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION After all, \"Black\" cannot leadthe city of Chicago. What does \"Black\" do?  How does \"Black\" run a city?  How does \"Black\" fix violence? How does \"Black\" fix the education epidemic? How does \"Black\" fix the lack of stable family households? How does \"Black\" replace the father the kid never had? And how in the world is \"Black\" generous? chic The racial stupidity that comes out of this mayor’s mouth is unfathomable. This stupidity costs lives and ruins futures. Our problem is not race. Being Black has never done any good for us. If it was so great, then why are we called the permanent underclass? Permanent, as in there is no hope for us. That’s where being Black has gotten us the last 60 years. Where is the generosity in that? I have said time and time again that the problems we face are human problems. We are not \"Black\" but human beings born in the greatest country known to mankind and it is time that we start thinking of ourselves in that regard. I tell the children in my neighborhood: look how lucky you are! God has blessed you with two feet, two hands, two eyes, two ears, and the most powerful tool known to man: your brain. That is why every single ounce of our efforts must be focused on developingthe full humanityof the people in my neighborhood. That is all that matters. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And we must do this despite having a mayor that hides like a coward behind race to mask his inferiority when it comes to solving the problems of our city.

    "article_text": "Sens. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., and Todd Young, R-Ind., discuss a bipartisan bill aimed at boosting U.S. commercial maritime activity and shipbuilding on 'Special Report.' IfDemocratswant to win back Congress and the White House, we must reclaim what made our party a national force in the first place: our commitment to being a big tent. For much of modern history, the Democratic Party has thrived by welcoming Americans from a wide range of backgrounds and beliefs. We didn’t require agreement on every issue to work together for a common cause—especially on topics like abortion orgun safety, where regional and cultural differences shaped the views of our candidates and voters alike. That flexibility helped us build durable coalitions capable of winning elections from city halls to Congress. But in recent years, we’ve moved toward a more rigid and absolutist posture—one that suggests a Democrat must align 100% with every plank of the party platform to earn the label. This \"all or nothing\" mentality has not only narrowed our reach; it’s jeopardized our ability to build the legislative majorities we need to govern. SEN BERNIE SANDERS: WE HAVE A GOVERNMENT OF BILLIONAIRES, BY BILLIONAIRES AND FOR BILLIONAIRES Take, for example,pro-life Democrats. While they may diverge from national party orthodoxy on reproductive rights, many of these leaders stand with us on issues like affordable healthcare, economic justice, and workers’ rights. In a divided electorate, supporting candidates like these can be the difference between holding a legislative chamber—or handing it over to Republicans who oppose our values wholesale. The same logic applies to gun safety. In rural districts where hunting and gun ownership are embedded in the culture, we shouldn’t expect every Democrat to support the same proposals as those from urban centers. We can still advocate for commonsense reforms—background checks, red flag laws, and safe storage—without insisting on litmus tests that alienate potential allies. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION AsGovernor Gretchen Whitmerhas said, we need to meet people where they are. That doesn’t mean compromising on our values—it means recognizing that no coalition succeeds without some ideological flexibility. Most parliamentary democracies around the world understand this. Majorities are built through negotiation and compromise between parties that may agree on only a few key issues. That’s how they keep government functional and extreme ideologies in check. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP We should do the same. Because what matters most is not ideological purity—it’s the power to govern. It’s the ability to pass legislation, confirm judges, invest in communities, and protect our democracy from those who seek to undermine it. If we want to win again—truly win—we must embrace the complexity of our electorate. We must build a Democratic Party that prizes inclusion over ideological conformity. Only then will we have the strength to meet this moment and the future beyond it. David Carlucci, a Democrat, is a former New York state senator.",

    "title": "GORDON CHANG: Is Trump rescuing China's Communists?",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump opens up about investments in America, trade negotiations, his trip to the Middle East and plans to transform Gaza on 'Special Report.' \"If I didn’t do that deal with China, I think China would have broken apart,\"President Donald Trump told Fox News' Bret Baierearlier this month. Trump was talking about the arrangement, announced May 12, in which the United States and China agreed, among other things, to reduce their general tariff rates on the other by 115 percentage points for 90 days. Most analysts have scored the pact as a win for China. The reduction in American tariffs allows China to resume sales to the U.S.—America accounts for more than a third of global consumer spending—but the reduction in Chinese tariffs does little to permit American goods to enter China. The main obstacles to American exports to China are China’s non-tariff barriers, and the announced pause does nothing to end non-tariff barriers put in place before April 2, \"Liberation Day,\" as Trump called it. BILLIONAIRE RAY DALIO RAISES ALARM OVER CHINA, SAYS TRUMP RENEGOTIATING TRADE DEALS 'HAS TO HAPPEN' Moreover, the reduction inU.S. tariffsis akin to unilateral disarmament. U.S. tariffs are generally remedies for China’s theft of U.S. intellectual property and its increasingly predatory trade practices. During the pause, China is continuing these unacceptable practices without facing the penalty of America’s elevated tariffs. \"China came out on top,\" Alan Tonelson, an American trade expert who blogs at RealityChek told me. \"No question, we got the short end of the stick.\" Trump’s \"tariff war,\" as the Chinese regime calls it, could not have come at a worse time for the Communist Party. The country’s economy was already in distress. Yes, the National Bureau of Statistics continually issues reports of robust growth of gross domestic product—5.4% in the first quarter—but in reality, the economy looks like it is contracting. Price data for February, March, and April confirm China is in a deflationary spiral. DONALD TRUMP DETAILS 'MOST EXCITING PART' OF CHINA TRADE AGREEMENT Trump’s \"Liberation Day\" tariffs battered China’s already struggling export sector. Factories were closing, unpaid workers were demonstrating in the streets, smaller banks were restricting withdrawals. As Trump suggested to Baier, the Chinese regime was struggling and might not have survived his high tariffs. The 90-day pause, therefore, gave the Chinese regime a lifeline. Now,China’s factoriescan make and ship products to America for the most important time of the year for them: the Christmas season, which starts around June. The Communist Party is no stranger to rescues from America. Three times American presidents have saved communism in China. TRUMP SAYS CHINA AGREES TO 'FULLY' OPEN COUNTRY'S MARKETS TO US BUSINESSES Richard Nixondid that in 1972, near the end ofMao Zedong’sdecade-long Cultural Revolution, essentially a civil war that almost brought down the regime. His visit to Beijing signaled to the Chinese people that America stood with communist rule. George H. W. Bush threw Deng Xiaoping a lifeline after the nation-wide demonstrations and slaughter in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square in 1989. Finally, there wasBill Clinton’strade deal in 1999, which came at a low point for a Chinese state then struggling to emerge from the Asian Financial Crisis. The deal paved the way for China’s fabulously beneficial—and wholly premature—entry into the World Trade Organization. TRUMP SAYS 'TOTAL RESET NEGOTIATED' WITH CHINA DURING TARIFF TALKS IN GENEVA Washington had a great need to enlist Mao in the Cold War struggle against the Soviet Union, but Bush and Clinton would have been much better off without the Chinese Communist state. Bush and Clinton, leading a dominant America, thought that Chinese leaders would reciprocate and work cooperatively with Washington and its partners. The Communist Party, almost everyone then assumed, would see it in its interest in maintaining an international system that was responsible for China’s rise. \"By now, it’s clear that our hopeful assumptions about China’s trajectory were fundamentally wrong,\" Charles Burton of the Sinopsis think tank told me this week. \"As China grew stronger, the Communist Party became even more hostile, belligerent, and dangerous.\" This month,Xi Jinpingdemonstrated that cooperation with his hostile, belligerent, and dangerous regime is not possible. First, China violated its promise to remove all \"the non-tariff countermeasures taken against the United States since April 2, 2025.\" Among those countermeasures is theApril 4 prohibition of export of magnets and certain mineralsto the U.S., which is still in place. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Then, the Communist Party, through the semi-official Global Times tabloid, signaled it would not by the end of 90 days remove what Trump on May 12 called \"all of its non-monetary barriers.\" Finally, on May 18, the Chinese central government upped the stakes,provocatively imposing a 74.9% anti-dumping dutyon U.S.-made POM copolymers, an industrial plastic. China’s response to Trump’s concessions was \"blatantly dishonest,\" Charles Burton, also a former Canadian diplomat in Beijing, said. \"Bad faith bargaining is the Communist Party’s stock-in-trade,\" he added. \"Trump’s comments to Bret Baier show that the president let up on China at exactly the wrong time,\" Tonelson pointed out. Trump had leverage and gave it up. China then went on the attack.

    "title": "Trump's Golden Dome missile defense system revives Reagan's nuclear shield dream",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announce a 'Golden Dome' missile shield and answer reporters' questions about the 'supertechnology' system from the Oval Office. On May 20, PresidentDonald Trumplaunched the Golden Dome missile defense initiative. I was in college when President Ronald Reagan launched the Strategic Defense Initiative—initially mocked by its opponents as \"Star Wars.\" Trump named Space Force Gen. Michael Guetlein as theGolden Domeproject’s leader, a tell that the system will be primarily space-based. Technology in two areas has altered the equation for missile defense, likely making defending against nuclear missiles—even hypersonic ones, less expensive than building theoffensive nuclear weapons. This was not the case when Reagan announced SDI in 1983. The Great Communicator said then that, \"What if free people could live secure in the knowledge that their security did not rest upon the threat of instant U.S. retaliation to deter a Soviet attack, that we could intercept and destroy strategic ballistic missiles before they reached our own soil or that of our allies? … this is a formidable, technical task … will take years, probably decades of effort on many fronts... But isn’t it worth every investment necessary to free the world from the threat of nuclear war? We know it is.\" CHINA ACCUSES US OF ‘TURNING SPACE INTO A ‘WARZONE’ WITH TRUMP’S GOLDEN DOME MISSILE DEFENSE PROJECT The threat of nuclear war that Reagan was worried about and thought immoral, was that of the doctrine of mutually assured destruction, or MAD. MAD held that a nuclear balance of terror could keep the peace—that as long as nuclear rivals knew that, even if they struck first, the other side could still inflict massive damage in return. Now, 42 years later, the cost to launch objects into low earth orbit has gone from about $12,045 per pound to $760 per pound for SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy and $33.41 per pound for Starship. This is a reduction in the cost to orbit of 360-fold with Elon Musk shooting for $4.54 per pound ($10 per kilogram)—a reduction in the cost of putting defensive systems into space of 2,400 times since the mid-1980s. This makes it far more affordable to loft a missile defense system into orbit. On the electronics front, the advancements are even more impressive. Computing power has surged over 40 years, with costs of processing power dropping by over 37 million times from 1985 to 2025, enabling real-time tracking of missiles aimed at the homeland. With lighter sensors and computers, modern interceptor missile warheads can weigh 4-10 pounds, compared to 22 pounds in 1985. Space-based sensor systems can be similarly lighter and far more capable. This revolution in the cost to orbit and the cost of computing power has likely hit an inflection point where it may be less expensive to build a missile defense shield than to build offensive nuclear weapons. The U.S. builds a new ICBM for about $162 million, while a modern missile interceptor, at 110 pounds, might cost $2,727 to launch into orbit and $1 million to manufacture. Deploying 1,000 interceptors could cost $1 billion (many interceptors are needed in orbit to counter any given launch), versus $16.2 billion for 100 ICBMs, suggesting defense could be cheaper, especially with ongoing technological improvements. Trump’s Golden Dome: A modern vision President Trump’sGolden Domeproject, on the other hand, is a $175 billion missile defense system designed to protect the U.S. from ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles, including those launched from space. Inspired by Israel’s Iron Dome, which has proven effective against short-range rockets, the Golden Dome aims to shield the entire U.S., a continent-spanning nation 450 times larger, from advanced threats. As envisioned, the system includes space-based interceptors, sensors, and satellites. Trump wants to have the system fully operational by 2029, integrating next-generation technologies across land, sea, and space. Given the 360-fold reduction in space launch costs (and likely 1,000-fold), and the massive increase in electronic capacity, Trump’s Golden Dome could realize Reagan’s SDI dreams. Unsurprisingly, China attacked the missile defense initiative less than 24 hours later, parroting the former Soviet Union’s response to SDI. More importantly, the Department of Defense will be capable of protecting the homeland from a devastating nuclear attack—without automatically resorting to a massive nuclear counterstrike that could kill and wound 100 million people or more.

The voice mode (in beta for now) allows Claude mobile app users to have “complete spoken conversations with Claude,” and will arrive in English over the next few weeks, according to Anthropic’sofficial account on Xandupdated documentationon the company’s website. At leastone user on Xreports having gained access to voice mode late Tuesday. By default, it’s powered by Anthropic’sClaude Sonnet 4model. “Voice mode … enables you to speak to Claude and hear responses through voice, making it easier to use Claude when your hands are busy but your mind isn’t,” reads asupport page. “Voice mode transforms how you interact with Claude by … displaying key points on-screen as Claude speaks [and] allowing you to speak to Claude and hear Claude’s voice responses.” We're rolling out voice mode in beta on mobile.Try starting a voice conversation and asking Claude to summarize your calendar or search your docs.pic.twitter.com/xVo5VHiCEb A number of AI companies, including OpenAI, offer voice chat experiences for their respective chatbots. Google, for example, hasGemini Live, while xAI has Voice Mode for Grok. Each lets users interact with bots by speaking instead of typing, making conversations feel more natural and intuitive. With Anthropic’s flavor of voice mode, users can chat about things like documents and images, and choose from five distinct voice options. Users can also switch between text and voice on the fly, and see a transcript and summary following conversations. The capability has certain limits. Voice conversations count toward regular usage caps — Anthropic says that 20-30 conversations is what most free users can expect. Moreover, only paid Claude subscribers can take advantage of a Google Workspace connector that allows voice mode to access Google Calendar appointments and Gmail emails (Google Docs integration is exclusive to Claude Enterprise plans). Anthropic CPO Mike Kriegerconfirmedthe company was working on voice capabilities for Claude in an interview with the Financial Times in early March. According to the report, Anthropic was holding talks with Amazon, the company’s major investor and partner, and voice-focused AI startup ElevenLabs, to possibly drive future voice features for Claude. It’s unclear which of those partnerships, if any, came to fruition. Topics AI Editor LIMITED TIME: Save $300+ on your ticket, plus an additional 50% on a second for a full immersive day of AI!

OpenAI is currently gauging interest from developers who might want to integrate this service into their apps. ChatGPT is quickly becoming one of the largest consumer applications in the world, now with roughly600 million monthly active users. To capitalize on this popularity, OpenAI seems eager to try and expand into other consumer areas, such asonline shopping,social media, andpersonal devices.A potential “Sign in with ChatGPT” feature could help OpenAI compete with other massive consumer technology companies — such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft — that help people with a wide range of online services, including a quick way to sign in to third-party apps. Earlier this month, OpenAI launched apreview of the “Sign in with ChatGPT”experience for developers in Codex CLI, the company’s open source AI coding tool for terminals. The feature let developers connect their ChatGPT Free, Plus, or Pro accounts to their API accounts. OpenAI offered Plus users $5 in API credits to sign in with ChatGPT, and Pro users $50 in API credits. Bigger deal than people are realizingsign in with chatGPT is about to be EVERYWHEREpic.twitter.com/XNsloe1nS8 OpenAI seems to be interested in integrating the sign-in service with a broad array of companies. The developer interest form asks for companies to specify their app’s user base, ranging from tiny companies with fewer than 1,000 weekly users to massive apps with over 100 million weekly users. The form also asks developers how they charge for AI features today and whether they’re customers of the OpenAI API. CEO Sam Altmannoted in 2023that the company may look into a “sign in with OpenAI” feature in 2024. However, it now appears OpenAI is more seriously building out the capability today, in 2025. It’s unclear when the sign-in feature would go live for users of ChatGPT or how many companies have signed up to be part of it. OpenAI did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.

While Pocket helped users save and discover millions of articles, Mozilla said the way people are browsing the web is changing, and it plans to focus its resources on other projects. Pocket users have until October 8, 2025, to export their saved articles and other items, including lists, archives, favorites, notes, and highlights. This essentially means you will have to find a new home to build a reading list through another save-it-later app. To help users with this transition, we’ve rounded up a number of apps you might want to consider. Matteris aGoogle Ventures-backed companythat makes an eponymous iOS app along with browser extensions for Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. The app lets you listen toarticles and transcribes your favorite podcasts. Though the app itself is free to use, you can pay $79.99 per year to unlock features like improved transcriptions for podcasts and YouTube videos, tools to adjust reading speed, and additional integrations with other apps like notes apps, Gmail, and Kindle. In March 2025, the company also addedan AI-powered co-readerto answer questions about different topics users might have while reading an article. Matter co-founder Ben Springwater says Pocket users can email him atben@getmatter.comfor a personal discount link. The company will soon offer the discount within its app and will launch a migration process for Pocket users. Instapaper, which was founded by developer Marco Arment in 2008, is one of the oldest read-it-later apps. It’s available on both iOS and Android, and lets you save unlimited articles and videos without paying any fees. It wasacquired by Pinterest in 2016. However, for $59.99 per year, you can add notes to saved articles, have a permanent archive of articles in your accounts, create a text-to-speech playlist to listen to stories, enable full text search for all saved items, and get the ability to send articles to your Kindle. The company saysPocket users can import their account into Instapaperat instapaper.com/user. Users who import this way will also receive an email offering a three-month free trial to Instapaper Premium. Raindropworks primarily as an alternative bookmark manager for web browsers. However, its accompanying mobile apps for iOS and Android allow you to read your saved articles or PDFs at any time. The free version gives you unlimited bookmark saving along with integrations like Zapier and IFTTT. If you decide to pay $33 per year, you will get AI-powered suggestions for organizing your content better, full text-search, reminders for your bookmarks, a duplicate and broken links finder, and a file upload limit of 10GB per month. Former Twitter engineer Joe Fabisevichcreated Plinky to allow users to save and categorize any kind of link, including articles, videos, recipes, and memes. The app is available across all Apple platforms, along with browser extensions to save links. Once you’re signed up,Plinkylets you use folders and tags to categorize your links, and even set reminders to read them at a specific time. You can save 50 links, create three folders, and use five tags with the free version. To remove these restrictions, you can pay $3.99 per month, $39.99 a year, or a one-time fee of $159.99. Pro users are able to save unlimited links, create an unlimited number of folders, use an unlimited number of tags, and set an unlimited number of reminders. With Pocket’s shutdown on the horizon,Fabisevich saysa dedicated Reader Mode will soon be added to Plinky’s app. The app is also offering a 50% discount on the Pro tier through the end of May 2025. Paperspanis a very simple app that offers a reading list across devices; allows you to add notes; and has text-to-speech functionality. The app is free, but it offers an $8.99 per month subscription to unlock advanced search, as well as the ability to create playlists, show reading stats, and send your articles to Kindle. Though the app works, PaperSpan hasn’t been updated for some time, which may not be a good signal about its long-term future. The app is available on both iOS and Android. Readwise, a tool to add notes and highlights to articles, launched itsReader app in 2021. The app allows you to import RSS feeds, YouTube videos, Twitter threads, and more to read at your convenience. Because of its integration with Readwise, the Reader app offers great annotation features. It also features offline text search and an AI assistant. Plus, you can integrate Reader with knowledge management apps such as Obsidian, Notion, Roam Research, Evernote, and Logseq. The app is free to try for 30 days, and then you have to pay a $9.99 per month Readwise subscription to access it. Readwise is letting Pocket users save their entire Pocket archive into Readerand notes that its app supportsa number of features — like PDFs, ePubs, X posts, AI, and filtering — which Pocket never did. DoubleMemoryis a new indie app focused on the Apple ecosystem, and it has native apps for both Mac and iOS. On Mac, you can easily save any link or content by pressingCmd + Ctwice. The saved content will then appear in a Pinterest-style tile format. The app also allows you to read offline and search through text, notes, and tags. You don’t need an account to start using DoubleMemory. And if you have multiple apps, it uses your iCloud account to sync content across them. DoubleMemory is free with in-app purchases. It offers a $3.99 monthly subscription or an annual subscription of $17.99. Recallworks as a browser extension and a mobile app that allows users to save content from the web, including articles, PDFs, blog posts, podcasts, Wikipedia pages, YouTube videos, and recipes. However, unlike traditional read-it-later apps, Recall uses AI to automatically summarize content, categorize it, and then resurface it when it’s related to something new you’re looking to learn about. Designed to enhance your ability to remember information, you can review your summaries from your personal knowledge base on a saved spaced repetition schedule. Recall is free to try with support for up to 10 free, AI-generated summaries. After that, you can continue to use Recall as a read-it-later tool, or you canupgradeto a $7 per month plan for unlimited AI summaries and other features. Wallabagis an open source read-it-later app that’s also available as an €11 per year hosted subscription, if you prefer. The app itself works across browsers and mobile devices, offers a reader mode for more comfortable reading, and supports importing data from other services like Pocket, Instapaper, and others. Open source web appReadeckis designed to help you organize any web content you want to revisit later, whether that’s articles, videos, photos, or anything else. You can also use the service to highlight text, export articles to e-book format, save video transcripts, and more. Readeck works as a browser extension so you can save your bookmarks as you surf the web. Users can host Readeck themselves, but the company says it will offer a hosted version in 2025. It’s also developing a mobile app. Obsidian‘sweb clipping servicelets you highlight and capture web pages you want to save with just a click on its browser extension. You can also use templates that customize how certain types of web pages are saved. For instance, articles are saved with their citations and footnotes, while recipes will include ingredients, steps, and nutrition. You can even set up custom templates to save from your favorite websites. As an open source app, Web Clipper is free to use, allowing you to highlight text, images, and blocks of content for saving into theObsidiannote-taking app. Karakeep‘s bookmarking app lets you save links, notes, and images, and then uses AI to automatically tag items and make retrieving them faster. The app includes other features like support for lists, bulk actions, dark mode, full-text search, and more. Theopen source appis available on iOS and Android as a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox. You can support its developerhere. Deweyis another “save everything”-style app that lets you save and organize web links, videos, and images, including posts from social media sites like X, TikTok, Bluesky, Threads, Reddit, Instagram, LinkedIn, and others. The service offers built-in organizational tools like folders and tags, AI bulk tagging, keyboard shortcuts, automatic syncing to Notion, export, a personalized RSS feed, and more. Dewey offers multipleplans, starting at $7.50 per month, which you can choose to pay annually for $30 off. This is not an exhaustive list, and we will keep adding more tools as we discover them.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Most delivery automation stops at the curb. But forVehoand Zurich-based robotics startup Rivr, the real challenge — and opportunity — lies in those final 100 yards from van to doorstep. In a pilot program launching Tuesday in Austin, Rivr’s four-wheeled, stair-climbing delivery robot, which CEO and founder Marko Bjelonic describes as “a dog on roller skates,” will ferry packages from Veho’s vans directly to customers’ front doors. The companies are starting small, they told TechCrunch exclusively. Just one highly supervised robot will work daily, making five- to six-hour runs over the span of a couple weeks throughout Austin. But both companies see it as a critical step toward solving a unique slice of the end-to-end autonomous delivery journey. Bjelonic says in last-mile delivery, “robotics makes an impact by actually solving these very challenging problems that are actually quite easy for humans but hard for robots. And we see [Rivr] as a differentiator, almost as the next evolutionary step from the sidewalk robots.” The partnership with Veho also gives Rivr an opportunity to both test its technology and accumulate data necessary to build a general physical AI framework. “What we have seen in the robotic space is that there’s a data barrier, because ChatGPT and other chatbots have the internet as training data, and autonomous cars have thousands of cars on the street that they can attach sensors to and start collecting data,” Bjelonic told TechCrunch. “But in the robotics world, that kind of dataset is missing, so you need to find the meaningful use case where you can solve a real problem, and then you can start collecting all of the data to make these robots more intelligent.” For Veho, which delivers across 50 U.S. markets for brands like Sephora, Saks, HelloFresh, and more, this partnership is a chance to test what automation looks like from the van to the customer’s door. That could eventually allow for more deliveries to take place at once, particularly in dense urban areas where both the driver and the robot can tag-team a particular street simultaneously. Bjelonic says Rivr’s “robot helpers” can also “reduce the workload on these drivers” by taking over the physically demanding task of walking door to door. During the Austin trial, a Rivr employee will accompany the bot to ensure safety and delivery quality. Bjelonic told TechCrunch the bots can operate autonomously, but remote operators will be able to tap in if they get stuck. The Austin pilot will start in the more residential area of Northwest Austin before expanding to denser areas of town, according to Fred Cook, Veho’s co-founder and CTO. In the future, Cook says he could imagine pairing the vehicles with certain types of vehicles with charging stations for the bots to keep them going for a full day of work. Rivr hopes to use the learnings from its partnership with Veho to scale to 100 bots by next year and thousands in 2027. The startup is currently operating in the U.K. through a partnership with delivery platform Evri. Rivr has raised more than $25 million, including from a Jeff Bezos-led round thatvalued the company at $100 million.

Now the company’s AI personnel will be assigned to an AI products team, or an AGI Foundations unit. No jobs appear to have been cut. The AI products team will focus on consumer-facing efforts like the AI features within Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, as well as Meta’s newstand-alone AI app. The AGI Foundations unit will focus on more of the bigger picture efforts, like improving its Llama models. As companies like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic make moves, Meta is trying its best to stay neck-and-neck with the competition. The company recently launched aLlama for Startupsprogram to encourage early-stage companies to use their products for generative AI applications. Meanwhile, much of Meta’sLlamaConevent in April was geared toward showing that it can compete with OpenAI.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us If and when AI will start replacing human labor has been the subject of numerous debates. While it’s still hard to say with certainty if AI is beginning to take over roles previously done by humans, a recent survey from theWorld Economic Forumfound that 40% of employers intend to cut staff where AI can automate tasks. Researchers at SignalFire, adata-driven VC firmthat tracks job movements of over 600 million employees and 80 million companies on LinkedIn, believe they may be seeing first signs of AI’s impact on hiring. When analyzing hiring trends, SignalFire noticed that tech companies recruited fewer recent college graduates in 2024 than they did in 2023. Meanwhile, tech companies, especially the top 15 Big Tech businesses, ramped up their hiring of experienced professionals. Specifically, SignalFirefoundthat Big Tech companies reduced the hiring of new graduates by 25% in 2024 compared to 2023. Meanwhile, graduate recruitment at startups decreased by 11% compared to the prior year. Although SignalFire wouldn’t reveal exactly how many fewer grads were hired according to their data, a spokesperson told us it was thousands. While adoption of new AI tools might not fully explain the dip in recent grad hiring, Asher Bantock, SignalFire’s head of research, says there’s “convincing evidence” that AI is a significant contributing factor. Entry-level jobs are susceptible to automation because they often involve routine, low-risk tasks that generative AI handles well. AI’s newcoding, debugging,financial research, andsoftware installationabilities could mean companies need fewer people to do that type of work. AI’s ability to handle certain entry-level tasks means some jobs for new graduates could soon be obsolete. Gabe Stengel, the founder of AI financial analyst startup Rogo, started his career at Lazard investment bank where he helped large pharma companies buy biotech startups. Rogo’s tool “can do almost all the work I did in the analysis of those companies,” Stengel said onstage at Newcomer’s financial technology summit last week. “We can put together the materials, diligence the company, look through their financials.” While most large investment banks haven’t explicitly reduced analyst hiring due to AI yet, executives at firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley previously considered cutting junior staff hires by up to two-thirds and lowering the pay of those they hire because the work with AI is not as demanding as before, theNew York Timesreported last year. Although AI’s threat to low-skilled jobs is real, tech companies’ need for experienced professionals is still rising. According to SignalFire’s report, Big Tech companies increased hiring by 27% for professionals with two to five years of experience, while startups hired 14% more individuals in that same seniority range. A frustrating paradox emerges for recent graduates: They can’t get hired without experience, but they can’t get experience without being hired. While this dilemma is not new, Heather Doshay, SignalFire’s people and talent partner, says it is considerably exacerbated by AI. Dashay’s advice to new grads: master AI tools. “AI won’t take your job if you’re the one who’s best at using it,” she said.

    "title": "Report: TuSimple sent sensitive self-driving data to China after US national security agreement",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Self-driving truck startup TuSimple (now CreateAI) sent a trove of sensitive data — effectively the blueprint of an American-made autonomous vehicle system — to a Beijing-owned firm after committing to the U.S. government that it would cease such transfers under a national security agreement, according toThe Wall Street Journal. The transfers to Chinese truck manufacturer Foton happened around February2022, just a week after TuSimple signed the agreement in which U.S. regulators ordered the company to separate its business and technology from China-based employees and partners with firewalls and governance controls. The data sharing continued up until TuSimple’s deadline to comply with the agreement six months later, according to hundreds of pages of correspondence that the Journal viewed. A subsequent investigation with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) found the data sharing didn’t technically violate the agreement, though TuSimple was fined for other infractions and paid a $6 million settlement without admitting fault, per the Journal. TechCrunch was unable to reach TuSimple, now CreateAI, for comment. Still, the saga of TuSimple’s data transfers to China exposes the limits of U.S. safeguards meant to balance foreign investment with national security. And it’s not just data that TuSimple has been trying to get across the border. This latest revelation comes eight months afterTechCrunch reportedthat some of TuSimple’s shareholders were trying to block the company from transferring its U.S. funds — roughly $450 million at the time — to the company’s Chinese subsidiary to fund a pivot to AI animation and content generation. That drama is still unfolding as one of TuSimple’s co-founders, Xiaodi Hou, fights in court for control over his voting shares so he canpush for liquidationof the company. In December 2024,TuSimple officially rebranded to CreateAI. The company has been embroiled in controversy since going public via IPO in 2021. TuSimple started as a China-backed startup founded in 2015 by Hou and Lu Chen, an entrepreneur with ties to Sina Corp. It quickly became an autonomous vehicle industry favorite, managing to raise around $2 billion from a mixture of Chinese and U.S.-based heavy hitters, and was one of the first in the U.S. to successfully complete a fully driverless run on public highways. TuSimple’s plans took a turn for the worse amid internal struggles and federal investigations into the company’s ties with China, leading to its decision toexit U.S. operationsand voluntarily delisting from the stock market in January 2024. The goal was to restart self-driving operations in China, but both the CFIUS agreement and other court orders that barred the company from transferring assets — financial or otherwise — to China made it next to impossible to restart operations there, the company has told TechCrunch. The Journal’s reporting sheds light on a previouslyreported controversy regarding Hydron, a Chinese hydrogen trucking startup founded by Chen, which shared an office with TuSimple China. The overlap between Hydron and TuSimple was the subject of the 2022 CFIUS probe, during which TuSimple revealed that its employees spent paid hours working for Hydron in 2021 and shared confidential information with the company. According to documents the Journal viewed, TuSimple negotiated a deal in 2021 between Hydron and Foton to develop autonomous trucks. Foton, a subsidiary of state-owned BAIC Group, has an agreement with a Chinese military university to work on AV tech. Through a combination of emails, Slack messages, and video calls, TuSimple sent partners technical instructions for server dimensions, brake designs, sensors, steering, power supply, and chips, per the Journal. Employees also routinely downloaded autonomy source code developed by their American counterparts. As geopolitical tensions and competition with China rise, TuSimple’s ties are serving as a cautionary tale for Washington that has helped drive ashift in U.S. policy, prompting stricter rules on Chinese-linked tech deals and fueling a broader push to block high-risk transactions outright.

The announcement, made Tuesday, comes about a year after early rumors of the acquisition sent both companies’ stock pricessliding. At the time, Informaticadeniedit was for sale, but a lot can change in a year. Under the terms of the deal, Salesforce will pay $25 in cash per share for Informatica’s Class A and Class B-1 common stock, adjusting for its prior investment in the company. Informatica was founded in 1993 and works with more than 5,000 customers across more than 100 countries. Thecompany had a $7.1 billionmarket cap at the time of publication. This acquisition will help bolster Salesforce’s agentic AI ambitions, the company’s press release stated, by giving the company more data infrastructure and governance to help its AI agents run more “safely, responsibly, and at scale across the modern enterprise.” “Together, we’ll supercharge Agentforce, Data Cloud, Tableau, MuleSoft, and Customer 360, enabling autonomous agents to act with intelligence, context, and confidence across every enterprise,” Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in the press release. “This is a transformational step in delivering enterprise-grade AI that is safe, responsible, and deeply integrated with the world’s data.” The path to this deal began in April 2024, when reports surfaced that Salesforce was eyeing Informatica. The market reaction was swift — both companies’ shares dipped on fears of a difficult integration or strategic mismatch. Informatica later issued a public statement denying any sale discussions. But what once seemed unlikely is now official. Informatica isn’t the first data management company Salesforce has acquired in the past year. In September, Salesforcesnapped up Own Company for $1.9 billion in cash. “Data security has never been more critical, and Own’s proven expertise and products will enhance our ability to offer robust data protection and management solutions to our customers,” Salesforce general manager Steve Fisher said in a press release at the time.

In April, Tesla sold 7,261 vehicles in the European Union, European Free Trade Association, and U.K., a 49% year-over-year decline. The fall in sales is particularly alarming considering Tesla recently launched a new Model Y vehicle, the kind of release that would typically attract more consumers. A closer look at car sales in the region shows that Tesla competitors have not experienced the same decline, suggesting that CEO Elon Musk’s political activities and alignment with U.S. President Donald Trump have had anoutsized effect on the brand.

The company said it has prevented more than $9 billion in fraudulent transactions over the past five years. In 2024, Apple stopped $2 billion in fraudulent transactions and blocked nearly 2 million risky app submissions from being published. The release of these metrics, in the days before Apple’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC 2025), isn’t just meant to highlight the benefits of selling software on the App Store. It also serves as a stark reminder of what developers will face if they try to go it alone on mobile payments. After Fortnite maker Epic Gamessuccessfully prevailed in a high-stakes legal battlewith Apple over App Store antitrust issues last month, Applewas forced to give U.S. app developersthe ability to link to alternative payment methods inside their apps, where Apple couldn’t take a commission. Though larger apps like Fortnite, Spotify, and Amazon Kindle were quick to take advantage of the new functionality, smaller app developers may still be on the fence as to whether it makes financial sense for them to process their own payments due to the risks of fraud, chargebacks, refunds, and other issues that Apple’s App Store handles in exchange for a 15%-30% commission on in-app purchases. Demonstrating the scale of its operation, Apple said it prevented over $2 billion in fraudulent transactions in 2024 alone across its App Store, which is live in 175 regions globally and sees an average of more than 813 million visitors per week. The iPhone maker also reminded developers that transaction fraud isn’t the only kind of risk that Apple protects against, noting that bad actors try to exploit users in other ways, like stealing personal data, creating fraudulent accounts, and pirating apps, among other things. Apple said it terminated more than 146,000 developer accounts in 2024 over fraud concerns, and rejected an additional 139,000 developer enrollments from bad actors. It also rejected over 711 million customer account creations and deactivated nearly 129 million customer accounts last year. And it blocked over 10,000 illegitimate apps on pirate storefronts, which included malware, pornography apps, gambling apps, and pirated versions of developers’ legitimate apps in fraudulent transactions and blocked nearly 2 million risky app submissions from being published. Under the EU’s Digital Markets Act, people in the region are now allowed toaccess alternative app storesthat host the kinds of apps that Apple’s policies don’t allow, or apps that want to market themselves to users outside Apple’s control for other reasons. Apple’s message to developers here suggests that those app stores are also often the place where developers’ own software is pirated and resold, putting them at risk. The company also noted it stopped nearly 4.6 million attempts to install or launch apps outside the App Store or other approved third-party marketplaces. Apple has long used the argument that its App Store commissions are about more than just processing payments, saying it’s also about providing security, hosting, distribution, and discovery, as well as blocking fraud. That’s a compelling case for smaller app developers, including those who already pay the reduced 15% commission as part of Apple’s Small Business Program. In fact,early datafromRevenueCat, which provides developers with subscription infrastructure, indicates that small businesses are unlikely to financially benefit from switching to their own payment systems. In its announcement, Apple also reviewed other aspects of its App Store business and how it benefited consumers and developers, sharing other, more detailed metrics around App Review, discovery fraud, payment and credit card fraud, and more. Combined, these numbers are designed to remind developers why they should choose the App Store in a market where it’s now no longer the only way to reach users or monetize mobile apps.

But for early-stage founders, the real question is: How do I turn this firepower into a product that actually works…and sells? That’s whereHao Sang, from OpenAI’s Startups Go-to-Market team, comes in. AtTechCrunch Sessions: AInext week —June 5 at Zellerbach Hall in Berkeley, California— he’ll unpack what it takes to build a durable AI engine inside a startup, from early integrations to responsibly scaling on frontier models. Sang works directly with founders who are in the trenches, helping them translate foundational tech into practical value. At OpenAI, his focus is on more than just technical lift — he’s helping companies think through architecture, monetization, and product-market fit in a landscape where those things shift quickly. Before joining OpenAI, Sang helped fintech founders grow at Stripe and held early GTM roles at OpenPhone and Slack. That mix of deep tech and go-to-market fluency gives him a rare lens into what separates noise from traction. In his session, Sang will walk through patterns he’s seeing across top AI startups: where they’re finding leverage, how they’re thinking about cost versus performance, and what mistakes tend to surface when teams move too fast without a strong technical or distribution base.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us New Zealand’s deep tech ambitions just got a $25 million boost. Outset Ventures, the Auckland-based venture firm and incubator that spun out unicorns like Rocket Lab and LanzaTech, has closed its second fund at an oversubscribed $41.5 million NZD. The fund’s mission is to back startups working on hard science and engineering breakthroughs — technologies its partners believeNew Zealand is uniquely suited to lead. That includes everything from aerospace to medical technology, though Outset is especially focused on energy generation and storage. The firm is betting that New Zealand, while too small to play on the frontlines of AI, can tackle the downstream energy and infrastructure problems that AI is already starting to strain. “We know that the biggest constraint for AI growth all comes down to who can get the most installed energy the fastest, and so that’s where we’ve ended up concentrating more of our attention,” Angus Blair, partner at Outset, told TechCrunch. Many of the startups in Outset’s cohort focus on delivering cheaper, cleaner ways to generate and store energy, recycle heat waste, and address infrastructure bottlenecks that AI is already straining, per Blair. One emerging Kiwi leader has beenOpenStar, a nuclear fusion startup that’s working on levitated dipole reactors, and is one of the few from Outset’s Fund I cohort to also receive funding from Fund II. The firm reached animportant milestone last Novemberwhen it created superheated plasma at temperatures of around 540,000 degrees Fahrenheit — an important step toward producing fusion energy, and one that took only around $10 million to get there as compared to many decades-long government-led initiatives in the fusion space. Then there’sEnergyBank, which is building long-duration energy storage for floated offshore wind that’s best suited for deeper waters. Blair said the firm’s solution is a perfect complement to the many plans to installmore floating offshore wind farmsin regions like the North Sea. “If you can firm that power, that power is worth a lot more, and so adding that long-duration energy storage can increase the profitability of those assets by about 50%,” Blair said. “It also [helps] power data centers and the rest of the grid, particularly in Europe, which is struggling with grid resiliency.” OpenStar and EnergyBank are just two examples of the kind of moonshot bets Outset is aiming to scale globally. Where Fund I validated deep tech as a viable path for Kiwi startups, Fund II is positioning Outset as a launchpad for companies with hard science at their core and massive international ambition. Part of that mission is backed by the firm’s 60,000-square-foot facility in Auckland, which gives portfolio companies access to lab and engineering gear that’s otherwise hard to come by. In a country where early-stage capital and technical facilities can be limited, this kind of vertical integration is a key part of how Outset de-risks deep tech. And while the fund’s $25 million might sound modest by Silicon Valley standards, Blair says it’s well-sized for New Zealand’s tight-knit ecosystem. “We’ve got really capital efficient businesses down here, and so it goes a remarkably long way,” Blair said. The country’s startup funding environment has alwaysleaned toward capital efficiencyand high technical quality over blitzscaling. In 2023, venture investment in New Zealand declined amid inflation, global economic uncertainty, and reduced appetite from more cautious offshore investors. But2024 saw a rebound, with venture and early-stage investment reaching $350 million ($587.6 million NZD) — a record high and a 53% jump from 2023. Outset’s own LP mix reflects this dynamic: About two-thirds of Fund II comes from local institutional and private sources, while the rest is from international high-net-worth individuals, many of whom have relocated to New Zealand later in their careers and are investing in its future. And even though Kiwi startups have drawn interest over the past few years from heavy-hitting global firms like Bessemer, DCVC, Founders Fund, and Khosla Ventures, that kind of international capital remains hard-won. Distance and a smaller local investor base make it more difficult for New Zealand startups to break into global capital networks early, even though access to those networks is essential for scaling. Despite its distance and small size, Blair argues New Zealand is well-positioned to tackle some of the world’s greatest challenges — and deep tech is where the country already has a track record. “It’s where our biggest wins in the venture-backed space have come from historically,” Blair said. “So founders and VCs feel they have a lot more license to go and take these big moonshot swings in these really technical domains.” Topics Senior Reporter Rebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch, where she covers Tesla and Elon Musk’s broader empire, autonomy, AI, electrification, gig work platforms, Big Tech regulatory scrutiny, and more.

    "title": "Gridcare thinks more than 100 GW of data center capacity is hiding in the grid",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Hyperscalers and data center developers are in a pickle: They all want toadd computing power tomorrow, but utilities frequently play hard to get, citing years-long waits for grid connections. “All the AI data centers are struggling to get connected,” Amit Narayan, founder and CEO ofGridcare, told TechCrunch. “They’re so desperate. They are looking for solutions, which may or may not happen. Certainly not in the five-year timelines they cite.” That has led many data centers to pursue what’s called “behind the meter” power sources — basically, they build their own power plants, a costly endeavor that hints at just how desperate they are for electricity. But Narayan knew there was plenty of slack in the system, even if utilities themselves haven’t discovered it yet. He has studied the grid for the last 15 years, first as a Stanford researcher then as a founder of another company. “How do we create more capacity when everyone thinks that there is no capacity on the grid?” he said. Narayan said that Gridcare, which has been operating in stealth, has already discovered several places where extra capacity exists, and it’s ready to play matchmaker between data centers and utilities. Gridcare recently closed an oversubscribed $13.5 million seed round, the company told TechCrunch. The round was led by Xora, Temasek’s deep tech venture firm, with participation from Acclimate Ventures, Aina Climate AI Ventures, Breakthrough Energy Discovery, Clearvision, Clocktower Ventures, Overture Ventures, Sherpalo Ventures, and WovenEarth. For Narayan and his colleagues at Gridcare, the first step to finding untapped capacity was to map the existing grid. Then the company used generative AI to help forecast what changes might be implemented in the coming years. It also layers on other details, including the availability of fiber optic connections, natural gas, water, extreme weather, permitting, and community sentiment around data center construction and expansion. “There are 200,000-plus scenarios that you have to consider every time you’re running this study,” Narayan said. To make sure it’s not running afoul of regulations, Gridcare then takes that data and weighs it against federal guidelines that dictate grid usage. Once it finds a spot, it starts talking with the relevant utility to verify the data. “We’ll find out where the maximum bang for the buck is,” Narayan said. At the same time, Gridcare works with hyperscalers and data center developers to identify where they are looking to expand operations or build new ones. “They have already told us what they’re willing to do. We know the parameters under which they can operate,” he said. That’s when the matchmaking begins. Gridcare sells its services to data center developers, charging them a fee based on how many megawatts of capacity the startup can unlock for them. “That fee is significant for us, but it’s negligible for data centers,” Narayan said. For some data centers, the price of admission might be forgoing grid power for a few hours here and there, relying on on-site backup power instead. For others, the path might be clearer if their demand helps green-light a new grid-scale battery installation nearby. In the future, the winner might be the developer that is willing to pay more. Utilities have already approached Gridcare inquiring about auctioning access to newfound capacity. Regardless of how it happens, Narayan thinks that Gridcare can unlock more than 100 gigawatts of capacity using its approach. “We don’t have to solve nuclear fusion to do this,” he said. Update: Corrected spare capacity on the grid to gigawatts from megawatts.

    "title": "King exercises discretion in Canadian speech after country's row with Trump",
    "article_text": "King Charles III was given a heartfelt standing ovation in Canada's parliament in Ottawa after a historic speech in support of the country staying \"strong and free\". Outside the Senate building later, another voice from the crowd shouted: \"Thanks for coming King Charles\" in a voice full of emotion - as the King himself had sounded at the end of his speech. But what was never mentioned was what the speech was really about: US President Donald Trump. There was a promise to \"protect Canadians and their sovereign rights\", but with diplomatic discretion, there was no mention of who might be threatening the country's independence. Claims by Trump that Canada would be the 51st US state hung over this speech, but his name was never uttered. Not when the speech talked of the virtues of \"open trade\" (ie, not tariffs) or when it talked of a \"critical moment\" in which \"democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, self-determination and freedom\" must be protected. And there was no one named as making it necessary to guard the country's \"fundamental rights and freedoms\". There might even have been an olive branch, with a promise by the Canadian government to do more to stop fentanyl crossing the border, a drug that was the subject of accusations by the US administration. But there was no mention of Trump by name. The opening of parliament followed a general election in which Mark Carney had been brought to power on a wave of anti-Trump sentiment. The speech was written on the advice of the Canadian government, but there was a great deal of symbolism in the King reading it out. The King of Canada was in town. Inviting King Charles seemed to have paid off for Carney, who afterwards said how well the speech had been delivered. \"Our sovereignty is strong,\" said Carney. From the parliamentarians inside the packed chamber to the crowds pressed up against the railings outside, the King's visit was seen as sticking up for Canada when it was under pressure from its bigger neighbour. Compared with openings of Parliament in Westminster, this was a more dressed-down affair. No crowns or robes, with the King looking businesslike in a suit. Showing this really is a relaxed country, the former PM, Justin Trudeau, was wearing a pair of green trainers. A theme of this brief royal visit has been paying respects to the First Nations people and the King noted that parliament was meeting on the territory of the Algonquin people. Among the parliamentarians were many representatives of First Nations communities, dressed in traditional outfits and spectacular headdresses. The speech, delivered in French and English, made a virtue of the country's diverse roots. Before the King's arrival, there was an unmistakable sense of anticipation with the sober lawmakers taking a few quick selfies before the big royal moment. There was that nervous buzz ahead of something important. There would be a long list of government plans and policies, but there was a bigger historic feel to events, with a huge media encampment outside and crowds lining the streets. The opening of parliament took place in Canada's Senate, which is currently using temporary accommodation while its own building is renovated. The building being used by the Senate used to be Ottawa's main railway station. You could still see how the floor of the chamber had once been the station concourse. A different type of king, Elvis Presley, had come through here on a train journey in 1957. If there were suspicious minds here about whether King Charles would stand up for Canada, he was able to put that to rest. In the warm Ottawa sunshine, there were crowds sending their own message by turning out to see the King. Even a fleeting visit here soon shows how deeply people have been upset by their near neighbours and allies in the US. There seemed to be a genuine sense of relief that the King was there and showing support. The King also looked pleased, standing outside the Senate, holding a quick walkabout while a motorcade of oversized black cars was waiting to drive him away. He later spoke of the \"warmest of welcomes\". He waved before he left, having a last look around, towards the crowds and towards the cameras. Was there someone south of the border watching? The US state department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce responded to the speech: \"I'm a fan of King Charles. And of Prince William and Princess Kate. I think they're a great family.\" Sign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysisevery week with our Royal Watch newsletter. Those outside the UK cansign up here. Federal agencies will review their grants to the top university to decide whether they should be terminated.

    "title": "Liverpool driver arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after parade crash",
    "article_text": "The driver of a car that ploughed into football fans during Liverpool's Premier League victory parade is being held on suspicion of attempted murder, police have said. Merseyside Police say a Ford Galaxy avoided a roadblock by tailgating an ambulance responding to reports of a member of the public having suffered a heart attack. The force say the man, 53 and from the city's West Derby area, was also being detained on suspicion of dangerous driving and driving while unfit through drugs. Fifty people, including children, were treated in hospital following the incident in Water Street, which happened shortly after 18:00 on Bank Holiday Monday. Det Ch Supt Karen Jaundrill said there were 65 confirmed casualties following the incident. Of the injured, police say, 11 remained in hospital. All are said to be in a \"stable\" condition. Merseyside's Assistant Chief Constable Jenny Sims said: \"It is believed the driver of the Ford Galaxy car involved in this incident was able to follow an ambulance on to Water Street, after the roadblock was temporarily lifted so that the ambulance crew could attend to a member of the public who was having a suspected heart attack.\" She added: \"There was no intelligence to suggest an incident of this nature would take place and, as we previously stated, the incident is not being treated as terrorism.\" The senior officer defended the policing operation during the parade, which attracted hundreds of thousands of people to the city. She told reporters that the force had planned for \"all contingencies\", including road closures and an armed police presence. Assistant Chief Constable Sims said an \"extensive investigation into the precise circumstances of the incident\" was continuing, and she once again urged people not to speculate about what had happened. The force has asked anyone with information about the incident to refrain from sharing it online and instead pass it on to police. Earlier, Liverpool City Region mayor Steve Rotheram suggested the suspect's car should not have been on Water Street and said questions about how it could have been driven there were \"legitimate\". Water Street remains closed while investigations continue into the incident. A police cordon remains in place, while members of the public have begun to lay flowers, cards and toys near the crash scene. Huge numbers of joyful Liverpool fans packed the city centre on Monday and lined the 10-mile (16km) parade route as the Reds celebrated winning their second Premier League crown and 20th top-flight league title. Witnesses graphically described the terror of what happened after the Ford Galaxy smashed into a tightly packed section of the crowd that had gathered on the pavement outside a bar. Some feared it was a terrorist attack. Robbie Potter, who was severely injured in the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, was on Water Street. \"I thought it was happening again,\" he told the BBC. \"How did a car get through? \"From the videos, they've been very lucky.\" Daniel Eveson's partner was dragged under the car's wheels and his baby son's pram was tossed down the street. For a moment, he said he did not know if they had survived. Mr Eveson, from Telford, told BBC Radio Shropshire he had seen \"people going flying and people screaming and just terror, pure terror\", adding: \"I thought I'd lost everything.\" The car struck Mr Eveson in the chest before his partner went under the wheels and was dragged down the road. The impact spun their son's pram about 15ft (4.5m) down the street. Mr Eveson was able to locate his son, who was unharmed, and leave him in a restaurant with helpers as he went back to search for his partner. Jack Trotter and his girlfriend Abbie Gallagher, from Newtownards in County Down,were hit by the carafter it surged towards them. \"The first thought that I got was: 'Where's Abbie? I need to find Abbie',\" the Liverpool fan from Northern Ireland told the BBC. \"Where's Abbie? You know she could be anywhere at this rate and lucky enough she was screaming my name and I found her.\" Mr Trotter was taken to hospital by ambulance and kept in overnight. He sustained injuries to his back and leg and is now walking with crutches. Messages of support have been sent to the people of Liverpool, including from King Charles III who said: \"I know that the strength of community spirit for which your city is renowned will be a comfort and support to those in need.\" The Prince and Princess of Wales also said they were \"deeply saddened\" by the incident, adding: \"What should have been a joyful celebration ended with tragedy.\" The Princess Royal visited the Royal Liverpool University Hospital, where medical staff spoke of how they were \"very, very fortunate\" that more people had not been injured. Reds legend and former captain Steven Gerrard posted on Instagram that he was \"shocked, sickened and saddened\" over the incident. Meanwhile former Liverpool FC manager Jürgen Klopp wrote that his \"thoughts and prayers are with all those who are injured and affected\". \"You'll never walk alone,\" the statement concluded, referencing the club's famous terrace anthem.

    "article_text": "Tens of thousands of energy customers are set to receive payouts of up to £1,000 each, and could see debts written off, in response to the scandal over the forced fitting of prepayment meters. Energy companies are paying out more than £70m in compensation and financial support to customers. It follows a review by the regulator, Ofgem, of the way suppliers switched often vulnerable customers to paying upfront, without their agreement, after they fell behind with their bills. Energy UK, representing energy firms, said suppliers had worked hard to \"put things right\", following the intervention by Ofgem. Eligible customers could receive payments starting at £40, rising to £250 or £500, depending on the way they were treated by their energy supplier, or where processes were not followed adequately. The £1,000 payments were for customers who had faced \"inappropriate installation\", Ofgem said. Some may already have received help, or have been contacted by their energy supplier. If not, customers did not need to take any action, Ofgem said, as compensation would be paid directly into customer accounts. \"Our priority has been to put things right for those who weren't treated properly, and ensure we don't see bad practice repeated,\" said Tim Jarvis, Ofgem's director general of markets. The scandal erupted two years ago, at the peak of the cost of living crisis, with energy prices spiking after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It emerged that energy firms were switching people who were struggling to pay their bills onto prepayment methods, either by remotely changing their smart meter to prepay mode, or by entering the property to install a new meter. There was a particular outcry when agents for British Gas were found to have forced their way into the homes of vulnerable people. Ofgem responded by suspending all forced installations and launching a review of the practice from January 2022 to January 2023. That review has found that suppliers \"fell short of required standards\" in the way they had treated customers. However, the nearly £74m Ofgem announced was being dispersed applies only to customers at eight suppliers: These firms had already disbursed £55m in financial support, Ofgem said. Another £5.6m would be paid in compensation to 40,000 affected customers. A further £13m would be used to write off debt for customers who had had a forced meter installation. Enforcement investigations are continuing for British Gas, Utilita and Ovo, representing tens of thousands more customers. A new code of practice is now in place with stricter conditions that companies must meet if they want to install prepayment meters without customer consent. Dhara Vyas, chief executive of Energy UK, which represents energy firms, said suppliers had been working closely with Ofgem to meet the regulator's requirements, but said there were instances where forced fittings were appropriate. \"Involuntary installations have been a last – but necessary – resort for cases where repeated attempts to address debt with the customer through other means have been unsuccessful,\" she said. \"It's bad for customers to fall further and further into arrears, and bad debt ultimately drives up the prices that is paid by all customers,\" she added. Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of the charity, Citizens Advice, said she would like to see the sector work quickly to disburse compensation to the worst affected. \"While it's right that those rules have been tightened, it's also vital that consumers get compensation for the distress that was caused,\" she said.",

    "title": "Hopes of motherhood crushed after IVF embryos destroyed in Israel's Gaza offensive",
    "article_text": "\"My nerves are shattered,\" says Noura, a 26-year-old Palestinian woman, explaining that she has been \"left with nothing\". After years of IVF treatment, she became pregnant in July 2023. \"I was overjoyed,\" she remembers, describing the moment she saw the positive pregnancy test. She and her husband Mohamed decided to store two more embryos at Al-Basma Fertility Centre in Gaza City, which had helped them conceive, in the hope of having more children in the future. \"I thought my dream had finally come true,\" she says. \"But the day the Israelis came in, something in me said it was all over.\" Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to Hamas's cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Since then at least 54,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry. Like thousands of Gazans, Noura and Mohamed had to repeatedly flee, and were unable to get the food, vitamins and medication she needed for a healthy pregnancy. \"We used to walk for long hours and move constantly from one place to another, amid terrifying random bombings,\" says Mohamed. Seven months into her pregnancy, Noura suffered a severe haemorrhage. \"She was bleeding heavily, and we couldn't even find a vehicle to take her to the hospital. We finally managed to transport her in a garbage truck,\" Mohamed explains. \"When we arrived, the miscarriage had already started.\" One of their twins was stillborn and the other died a few hours after birth. Mohamed says there were no incubators for premature babies available. \"Everything was gone in a minute,\" says Noura. As well as losing the twins, they have also lost their frozen embryos. The director of Al-Basma Fertility Centre, Dr Baha Ghalayini, speaks with sorrow and disbelief as he explains that it was shelled in early December 2023. He is unable to provide an exact date or time and bases this estimate on the last time a member of staff saw the fertility centre operational. Dr Ghalayini says the most important part of the clinic housed two tanks that held nearly 4,000 frozen embryos and more than 1,000 samples of sperm and eggs. \"The two destroyed incubators - which cost over $10,000 - were filled with liquid nitrogen that preserved the samples,\" he says. They needed to be topped up regularly and \"about two weeks before the shelling, the nitrogen began to run low and evaporate\". The laboratory director, Dr Mohamed Ajjour, who had been displaced to southern Gaza, says he \"made it to the nitrogen warehouse in Al-Nuseirat, and got two tanks\". But he says the intensity of the shelling prevented him from delivering them to the clinic, about 12km away: \"The centre was shelled and the nitrogen became useless.\" Dr Ghalayini says the centre stored embryos for patients being treated at other clinics as well as their own. \"I'm talking about 4,000 frozen embryos. These are not just numbers, they're people's dreams. People who waited years, went through painful treatments, and pinned their hopes on these tanks that were ultimately destroyed.\" He estimates that between 100 and 150 women lost what may have been their only chance at having children, as many cannot undergo the procedure again. \"Some are getting older, some are cancer patients, others suffer chronic illnesses. Many received strong fertility medications that they can receive just once. Starting again is not easy.\" When approached for comment, the Israel Defense Forces told the BBC they would be better able to respond if the \"specific time of the strike\" was provided. They added that they \"operate according to international law and take precautions to minimize civilian harm\". In March this year, the UN's Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory made the accusation that Israel \"intentionally attacked and destroyed the Basma IVF clinic\" in a measure \"intended to prevent births among Palestinians in Gaza\". It also alleged that Israel prevented aid, including medicines necessary to ensure safe pregnancy, childbirth, and neonatal care from reaching women. The commission went on to claim that Israeli authorities \"destroyed in part the reproductive capacity of the Palestinians in Gaza as a group… one of the categories of genocidal acts\". At the time of the report, Israel's permanent mission to the UN issued a statement saying it \"categorically rejects these baseless accusations\". And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded angrily, calling the Human Rights Council - which commissioned the report - \"an antisemitic, rotten, terrorist-supporting and irrelevant body\". Instead of focusing on war crimes committed by Hamas, he said, it was attacking Israel with \"false accusations\". A spokesperson for the IDF told BBC Arabic it \"does not deliberately target fertility clinics, nor does it seek to prevent the birthrate of Gaza's civilian population. \"The claim that the IDF intentionally strikes such sites is baseless and demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of the purpose of IDF operations in Gaza.\" Dr Ghalayini says all of Gaza's nine fertility clinics have either been destroyed or are no longer able to operate. Noura explains that leaves her and many others with little chance of ever having a child. People like Sara Khudari, who began her fertility treatment in 2020. She was preparing for an embryo to be implanted when the war began in October 2023. The procedure never happened. \"I watched everything collapse,\" she says. And Islam Lubbad, who Al-Basma clinic helped to conceive in 2023, a few months before the war broke out. But a month after the fighting started, she lost her baby, like Noura. \"There was no stability. We kept relocating. My body was exhausted,\" she says, recalling how she miscarried. Islam did have more frozen embryos stored at Al-Basma Fertility Centre, but they have now been lost and there are no IVF clinics operating left for her to try to get pregnant again. Their letter warns of genocide in Gaza, and calls on the UK to take concrete actions to meet its international legal obligations. Gideon Amos said he was worried about \"knock-on pressures\" after a nearby ward was shut. Hundreds of Palestinians collect food from a site run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, whose work the UN calls a \"distraction\". New figures show waiting lists have an growing number of two-year waits for appointments and treatment. Israeli opposition leaders condemned attacks on Palestinians as \"racist\" and a disgrace to Judaism.",

    "title": "Environmental rules reviewed for small housebuilders",
    "article_text": "Environmental rules that force developers in England to improve wildlife habitats could be eased under government plans to make it easier to build homes on smaller sites. The government is reviewing Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) requirements, under which builders must compensate for the loss of any nature on housing developments. Ministers say they are considering how costs can be reduced for smaller housebuilders whilst also delivering habitats for wildlife. The proposals are part of a package of housing reforms to be set out by the Labour government on Wednesday. The Conservatives said they had been pushing the government to do more to support small businesses. Housing Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner wants to simplify the planning system to speed up house-building on smaller sites. There are plans to ease BNG requirements for minor developments of up to nine homes and give trained planning officers rather than councillors the power to approve them. Ministers have also suggested exempting sites of between 10 and 49 homes from a tax to fund the removal of unsafe cladding. The government said smaller firms had seen their market share shrink since the 1980s, when small- and medium-sized builders delivered 40% of the country's homes. \"For decades the status quo has failed them and it's time to level the playing field,\" Rayner said. \"Today we're taking urgent action to make the system simpler, fairer and more cost effective, so smaller housebuilders can play a crucial role in our journey to get Britain building.\" The shadow secretary for local government, Kevin Hollinrake, said Labour was \"stripping councillors of the right to vote on local planning applications, concreting over green belt and withdrawing support for first-time buyers\". He said Rayner would bring \"higher taxes and less say over development in your community\". Ministers hope these policy changes will help them reach the government's stated aim of building 1.5m new homes in England by 2030. Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) figuresreleased in March suggested housebuilding would fall short of the 1.5 million target, even with planning reforms previously outlined earlier this year. The government argued that further reforms not factored into the OBR forecast would help it reach the number. Last year saw a record low for housing projects granted planning permission in England, with just over 30,000 projects given the go-ahead. The difficulty of hitting the house-building target has brought the impact of BNG into sharper focus. BNG became a mandatory part of the planning system in England in February as part of the 2021 Environment Act. It means sites have to be assessed and housing developers must commit to delivering a 10% net improvement in biodiversity that lasts over a 30-year period. Last month, the Home Builders Federation said the BNG had placed a \"disproportionate burden on small and medium-sized home builders\". \"The home-building industry has embraced BNG and is committed to both increasing housing supply and protecting and enhancing our natural environment,\" Neil Jefferson, chief executive at the Home Builders Federation, said. \"However, if we are to increase supply alongside these new requirements it is vital to address emerging barriers to implementation, such as the insufficient resourcing of local authorities, shortage of ecologists, and inadequate national guidance.\" But the Wildlife and Countryside Link, a coalition of conservation groups, urged the government not to \"turn back the clock to the days of damaging development\". Richard Benwell, chief executive of Wildlife and Countryside Link, said: \"Exempting small sites would mean almost three-quarters of developments face no requirement to compensate for nature loss - let alone enhance it. \"These changes could leave the Biodiversity Net Gain system dead in the water and, with it, the government's main guarantee of nature-positive planning.\" The government is launching a consultation reviewing BNG and alongside this, is investing £100m in loans to help smaller house-building firms. Stories from Cumbria include swimmers being warned after harmful algae is found in Windermere.

    "title": "Tesco shoppers mock 'VAR'-style cameras at self-checkout",
    "article_text": "Tesco's introduction of AI technology to some self-checkouts has led to customers joking that it bears a striking resemblance to the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) technology used in football. The supermarket is aiming to reduce shoplifting by installing overhead cameras to identify when shoppers fail to scan an item properly, and then showing a live-action replay of the item not scanning. While some shoppers mocked the tech, others complained it was a step too far, with some saying they would not use self-checkout again. The move comes after shoplifting in the UK hit a record high in 2024. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that shoplifting offences recorded by police in England and Walesrose 20% last year to 516,971. But the number of thefts recorded by retailers themselves is even higher. Figures from the British Retail Consortiumsuggest there were 20.4 million theftsin the year to last September, up 3.7 million on the year before, costing retailers £2bn. Tesco said it had rolled out the technology across some of its stores in a bid to help customers using self-service checkouts to identify if an item hasn't scanned properly. The supermarket said it would make the checkout process \"quicker and easier\". If an item fails to scan, customers are shown a video on the self-service screen of their attempt, accompanied by a message saying \"The last item wasn't scanned properly. Remove from bagging area and try again.\" It follows a similar move by Sainsbury's, which has rolled out AI recognition technology at self-service checkouts at some of its stores. \"We regularly review the security measures in our stores and our decisions to implement them are based on a range of factors, including offering our customers a smooth checkout experience,\" said a Sainsbury's spokesperson. \"VAR Decision – Tuna Disallowed,\" joked one commenter on avideo posted on Instagramshowing the technology flagging an item that had failed to scan properly, which has had more than 3.5 million views. \"Clearly off side,\" added another. But on Bluesky, a uservoiced fearsthat the technology could open the door to more surveillance measures. \"What's next? Drones to follow… you about the store?\" On Facebook,another user saidhe would \"not use self-checkouts\" after the technology was introduced. The move marks the latest attempt by retailers to try to stem the rise in shoplifting. Tesco has alsointroduced giant trolley scalesat its Gateshead store, which prompted a similarly mixed response from shoppers earlier this year. \"Am I at border control or Tesco?\" asked one Reddit user. Last week Greggs announced that it willmove its self-serve food and drinksbehind the counter at sites where there are high levels of theft. And in 2023, photos circulating on social mediashowed supermarkets had fitted productsincluding steaks and cheese with security tags, while coffee was replaced with dummy jars.

    "title": "Giant's Causeway visitors urged not to jam coins into iconic rocks",
    "article_text": "The Giant's Causeway has faced many threats to its survival, from mythical fights between giants to coastal erosion and rising sea levels. Now there's a new problem. At first, you don't notice them but as soon as you see one, you start to see them everywhere - hundreds of them, in every fissure and crevice. They are coins, inserted into the tiny gaps between one of Northern Ireland's most famous and photographed natural resources, the basalt columns of the Giant's Causeway. Like the padlocks left on the Pont des Arts bridge in Paris, people often leave the coins behind for love or luck. But, like that tradition, the coins are causing problems, and now visitors are being asked to keep their spare change in their pockets. In Paris, it has been made illegal to attach a padlock afterpart of the bridge collapsed in 2014. At the Giant's Causeway, the practice started years ago – but the caretakers for the site, the National Trust, believe it has increased significantly in scale in the last decade or so. Hundreds of thousands of tourists and locals visit each year and only a fraction leave behind this unwanted memento. But the coins are having a direct impact on the rocks themselves. The worst affected are the basalt columns that make up The Loom – 10 ft high leaning towers of rock. They are a slightly lighter colour than the iconic hexagonal black basalt at the point of the causeway. It is easy to see at first glance the discolouration caused by the coins - a reddish-brown wash over the surface. Dr Cliff Henry, nature engagement officer with the National Trust, said the rocks are affected on a number of levels. \"People see others put coins in, so they copycat, they take a coin out of their pocket and they might take a stone off the ground to hammer the coin in, but they might miss and chip the stone itself so that's doing damage.\" He added: \"Once the coin is in there it starts to rust and due to the atmosphere here it rusts at an accelerated level. \"The coin then expands and that's putting pressure on the joint near the edge so we have seen on a number of places here that the corners have popped off. \"And the rusting metal in there is starting to leach. The iron and nickel and copper is leaching out over the rocks and it looks unsightly.\" He said they're appealing to people to stop inserting the coins before more damage is done to these 60-million-year-old rocks. \"On a geological timescale, this is very rapid erosion.\" A report from the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland shed some light on the problem. Dr Kirstin Lemon said: \"The advice of the Geological Survey to the National Trust is to see if we can remove as many of those coins as we can. \"By removing them, it means we're stopping any further physical impact on the site itself. We're also stopping that chemical impact as well.\" She said she hoped that by removing coins, it would stop others adding more. A specialist stonemason has started the work and has removed about 10% of them so far. \"He's done some test sites already so we know we can take these coins out without doing damage to the stones themselves,\" said Dr Henry. \"We want him to do it - we don't want the general public to do that, we don't want to cause any further damage.\" Signs will also be put up and visitors are already warned not to insert the coins by tour guides at the Giant's Causeway, like Mark Adams. \"I think it's a simple thing of wanting to leave something of themselves behind,\" he said. \"But if you want to leave something behind, take a photo, put it online, it'll be there forever.\" Last year, the Giant's Causeway received about 684,000 visits. The numbers are steadily climbing back to their pre-pandemic levels. There were nearly a million visits in 2019. The National Trust said not only is it Northern Ireland's most valuable natural phenomenon, it is important for the economy too. \"It's an icon for Northern Ireland - if we can't look after this, what's the hope for the rest of the country?,\" said Dr Henry. \"We really need to be looking after the causeway as best we can.\" A dead minke whale washed up at Portstewart Strand in County Londonderry on Sunday evening.

    "title": "Hundreds of lawyers call for UK sanctions on Israel over Gaza war",
    "article_text": "Hundreds of lawyers have called on the UK government to use \"all available means\" to stop the fighting in Gaza, including reviewing trade ties with Israel and imposing sanctions and travel bans on Israeli ministers. Some 828 UK-based or qualified legal experts, among them former Supreme Court justices, signed aletterto Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer on Monday. They warned \"genocide is being perpetrated in Gaza\" from Israel's blockade of food and aid and its new military offensive, which has killed hundreds of Palestinians there in the past fortnight. Israel has strongly denied genocide allegations, claims which are also being examined by the International Court of Justice. The group of legal experts includes former Supreme Court Justices Lord Wilson and Lord Sumption, former chair of the Criminal Bar Association of England and Wales Andrew Hall KC, and several professors from Oxford and Cambridge universities. Their letter comes amid a wave of increased criticism from Israel's Western allies, condemning its latest military offensive, which began in mid-May, and the impact of its blockade. The blockade was in full effect for 11 weeks from 2 March. Last week,the UK, France and Canada issued a joint statementcondemning Israel's \"egregious\" expansion of military operations in Gaza. Israeli Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahu accused the British, French and Canadian leaders of \"siding with Hamas\", saying the offensive was aimed at freeing the remaining 58 hostages held by the group. But UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy called the escalation \"morally unjustifiable\". The UK last week suspended trade deal talks, summoned Israel's ambassador and imposed fresh sanctions on West Bank settlers. Netanyahu has declared Israel's intention to take over the Gaza Strip and displace residents from the north to the south. The operation has seen about a 100 Gazans killed per day in strikes in its first week, according to the territory's Hamas-run rescue authorities and health ministry. On Monday, the group of legal experts said in a detailed 36-page letter that Israel's May offensive was \"a grave violation\" of international law, and also violated the Palestinian people's legal right to self-determination. The group of lawyers, legal experts and retired judges expressed their \"deep concern over the worsening catastrophe\" in Gaza and the occupied West Bank where violations of international law were \"being committed and are further threatened\" by Israel. \"First, genocide is being perpetrated in Gaza or, at a minimum, there is a serious risk of genocide occurring,\" the legal experts wrote. They said this had beencaused by Israel's blockade- and the trickle of aid now being allowed in was \"gravely insufficient.\" They said the UK and all countries were legally obliged to \"prevent and punish genocide\". \"The UK's actions to date have failed to meet those standards\", they said, but they welcomed the \"indication\" of stronger action in last week's statement. The UK must immediately impose financial and immigration sanctions on Israeli ministers suspected of \"unlawful conduct\", to help secure a ceasefire, the lawyers wrote. The letter also called for the UK to review existing trade ties with Israel, impose trade sanctions on the country and also suspend the UK's \"2030 Roadmap\" with Israel - an agreement between the UK and Israel on defence, technology and science, culture, the arts and other areas. They called on the government to ensure it would adhere to its obligations as a member of the International Criminal Court to act on arrest warrants issued by the court. Netanyahu is currently wanted by the court for alleged war crimes in Gaza and breaches of international law, charges he emphatically denies. The letter is the group's latest since the war began in October 2023. Its first missive was issued weeks into the conflict, where it raised concerns about the UK government selling arms to Israel. The legality of the UK's decisions concerning arms sales is now being examined by the High Court of England and Wales. Israel launched a military campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 54,056 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 3,901 since Israel resumed its offensive on 18 March following a two-month ceasefire, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. On Tuesday, Germany and Finland also spoke out, saying Israel must allow humanitarian aid into Gaza immediately. \"We must put pressure on Israel to ensure the aid truly reaches its target,\" German Chancellor Friedrich Merz told reporters alongside Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo in Finland. \"But it is also crucial that Hamas must not prevent humanitarian aid from arriving.\" Merz, who has strongly criticised Israel in recent days, said events in Gaza were \"in no way acceptable\". He described the effect on Gazan civilians as \"excessive\" and called for an end to the killing and suffering. \"This is a terrible human catastrophe and we must be able to tackle it,\" Orpo added. Sweden on Tuesday also summoned the Israeli ambassador to its foreign ministry, and called on the country to \"immediately ensure safe and unhindered humanitarian access to Gaza\". The Swedish foreign ministry said in a statement that Israel had a right to defend itself but \"the current way the war is waged is unacceptable\". In what amounts to a direct plea to the chancellor, Sir Mark Rowley says the police are \"overstretched\". A Unifil spokesperson said the main violations of a ceasefire deal reached six months ago are from the Israeli side. Israeli opposition leaders condemned attacks on Palestinians as \"racist\" and a disgrace to Judaism.

    "title": "Why police released details about Liverpool crash suspect so quickly",
    "article_text": "After a driver ploughed into crowds during the Liverpool FC victory parade on Monday evening, Merseyside Police said within two hours they had arrested a \"53-year-old white British man from the Liverpool area\". It was striking how quickly police shared the man's nationality and ethnicity. The decision shows lessons have already been learned from the Southport attacks last summer, when online speculation and disinformation filled a void after the same force released little detail about the 17-year-old they had in custody. Usually when a suspect is arrested, police forces in England and Wales just give out the age of the person and where they were arrested. But at 19:53 BST, the force emailed out a press release including the suspect's age, nationality and ethnicity. It was a clear attempt to damp down inaccurate speculation on social media that the Ford Galaxy driving into Liverpool fans was part of an Islamist terrorist attack, or was in any way linked to migrants. Merseyside Police acted \"very, very quickly\" to stamp out speculation on social media that had caused \"real consternation\", Liverpool mayor Steve Rotheram said. By contrast, last summer in the aftermath of the horrific knife attack in Southport in which Bebe King, Elsie Dot Stancombe and Alice Da Silva Aguiar were killed, Merseyside Police said very little about the suspect they had arrested. This meant that inaccurate social media speculation and deliberate disinformation about the suspect having a Muslim name and being a newly arrived migrant went unchecked. A consequence was a riot in Southport within 36 hours of the attack focused on the local mosque, and then further rioting across England, much of it aimed at hotels housing recently arrived asylum seekers. The Southport attacker Axel Rudakubana had in fact been born in the UK and had no direct connections to Islamism, though he had downloaded an academic study of an al-Qaeda manual. In a report published earlier this month into last summer's events, His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services said the police service \"must do more to communicate online\" and \"fill the information void with the truth\". \"Forces must provide a true narrative online to reach people who may be searching for information,\" it added. The report went on to say: \"The police service must communicate the facts. Repeatedly, continuously and effectively as circumstances change and develop. \"If not, others will take over the narrative with overwhelming amounts of online content. And some of this may be false or harmful to the police response and the communities the police are there to protect.\" The way Merseyside Police's communications team responded last night suggests that the force has rapidly adapted its policies since the violent disorder of last summer. It means that a clearer picture of what had happened quickly reached people's phones, TVs and radios and rapidly reduced the disinformation. The problem that police forces now face is whether this new approach will lead to confusion in future. What will a force do for example if the information about the suspect they are holding is unclear? Even more problematically, what will a force do if they arrest someone in similar circumstances who is a recently arrived migrant or who has a clearly Muslim name? Last night's rapid move to correct the narrative may not be as straightforward in different circumstances.

    "article_text": "A53-year-old white British man has been arrested after a car hit a number of pedestrians in Liverpool city centre during the Premier League victory parade. Eyewitnesses and videos shared on social media have shown the vehicle driving through a crowd as people scatter. Police say the man is being held on suspicion of attempted murder, dangerous driving offences and driving while unfit through drugs. Here's what we know so far. Just after 18:00 BST on Monday, a car collided with a number of pedestrians towards the end of the parade route on Water Street. Infootage verified by the BBC, fans could be seen confronting the car before it ploughed through the crowds. Police said on Tuesday that, overall, there had been 65 confirmed casualties. It said 50 people were treated at hospitals and of these, 11 remained in hospital but were in a stable condition and recovering well. Four children were among the injured, one of whom was seriously hurt, police had said on Monday. Four people, including a child, were also lifted from beneath the car. Video from the scene shows the car ploughing into the a group of people. Other footage shows people striking the car after it stopped, with the back windscreen shattered. One eyewitness, BBC reporter Matt Cole, described seeing a car coming through the crowd that \"just wasn't stopping\". He said it was being chased by a group of men \"who were trying to bang on the side of it and throw things at it\". He estimated the car was travelling at \"more than 20 [mph]\". He said his initial assumption was that the driver just wanted to \"barge through crowds because they didn't want to wait\". Another witness, Matthew O'Carroll, 28, from Runcorn, saw the car approaching the top of Water Street. He said the vehicle had been going at a \"decent\" speed and that the driver had been beeping as he went through the crowd. The BBC has also heard from other witnesses, including Daniel Eveson from Telford, Shropshire, and Jack Trotter, from Newtownards, County Down, who were injured in Monday's collision. Mr Eveson was hit in the chest, while his partner was dragged under the car wheels and his baby son's pram tossed down the street. For a moment, he did not know if his partner or son had survived, he said. He was able to locate his son, who was unharmed, while his partner remained in hospital and was waiting to hear whether she could return home. Mr Trotter - who had travelled to the parade with his girlfriend Abbie Gallagher - was hit by the car as it drove into fans on Water Street and sustained injuries to his back and leg. He has since been discharged from hospital and said he feels \"very lucky to be alive\". Ms Gallagher told the BBCthat she saw the car coming towards them and remembered putting her hands on the bonnet to protect herself. \"I was towards the driver's side and Jack was on the passenger side when the car was coming at us,\" she said. \"It was a good five minutes later until I found Jack, and I just saw him and we hugged each other.\" Water Street is near the Strand, where moments before the incident occurred Liverpool FC had paraded the Premier League trophy from the top of a bus. Thousands of people had come out to celebrate the team's victory. The incident happened about a mile before the parade's finishing point. Water Street was closed to traffic, the police said on Tuesday. However, they said the roadblock was temporarily lifted on Monday to allow an ambulance to attend to a member of the public who was having a suspected heart attack. \"It is believed the driver of the Ford Galaxycar involved in this incident was able to follow an ambulanceonto Water Street\", she said. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is being kept updated on the latest developments. He posted on X: \"The scenes in Liverpool are appalling - my thoughts are with all those injured or affected. \"I want to thank the police and emergency services for their swift and ongoing response to this shocking incident.\" Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the pictures were \"deeply worrying\". \"My thoughts are with all those affected, and the emergency services as they respond to what appears a horrific incident,\" she said. King Charles III, who has beenin Ottawa to open the 45th session of Canada's parliament, said he and Queen Camilla were \"deeply shocked and saddened\" by Monday's events. \"At this heartbreaking time for the people of Liverpool, I know that the strength of community spirit for which your city is renowned will be a comfort and support to those in need\", the post on X said. Liverpool FC said it was in contact with the police and that its \"thoughts and prayers are with those who have been affected by this serious incident\", with rivalsEverton FC echoing the sentiment. Liverpool's staff celebrations are understood to have been postponed because of the incident. The Premier League also released a statement on Monday, saying \"everyone at the Premier League is shocked by the appalling events in Liverpool this evening, and our heartfelt thoughts go out to all those injured and affected.\" Liverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotherham told the BBC a day of \"absolute celebration\" had been \"overshadowed\" by the incident. He urged the public to avoid speculation while police continue their investigation. Police said the crash was \"not currently being treated as terrorism\" - they said they believed it to be an isolated incident \"and we are not currently looking for anyone else in relation to it\". Police only define events as terrorism if they are considered to have been intended to influence the government or intimidate the public for the purpose of \"advancing a political, religious, racial or ideological cause\". Liverpool boss Arne Slot thanks \"the wider football community\" for its support as he is named manager of the year and Premier League manager of the year at the LMA awards. Jack Trotter and his girlfriend Abbie Gallagher, from Newtownards, County Down, were hit by the car as it drove into fans on Water Street, in Liverpool Police say the car followed an ambulance through a roadblock before the crash in which 65 were hurt.

    "title": "'Driver looked emotional and agitated' - witnesses share stories",
    "article_text": "There were already signs that something had gone wrong in Liverpool city centre before the car ploughed into the crowd. Tens of thousands had gathered to see Liverpool FC parade the Premier League trophy and were, as one witness put it, \"packed like sardines\" on Water Street. But a few hundred yards away, a large Ford family car was trying to make its way through the dense crowds of jubilant supporters on a road which was supposed to be closed. By the time someone had started to film the car, a few people in the crowd were trying to stop the driver from getting any further. At least one man threw a punch at the car, and another kicked it with enough force to dislodge its rear windscreen wiper. The car jolted back twice, nearly taking people off their feet both times, before veering around a stationary car and picking up speed as it headed onto Water Street. Further down, someone managed to open the advancing car's door but it kept moving forward. Seconds later, one fan who witnessed the carnage described seeing people \"scattered like bowling pins\". BBC News has spoken to several people who were on Water Street on Monday to understand how, as one fan put it, \"paradise turned to hell\". On Tuesday, police confirmed Water Street was meant to be closed for the parade. Investigators believe the driver followed an ambulance, which was on its way to attend to a suspected heart attack, to get through the cordon. One of those who saw the incident close-up was Matthew O'Carroll, 28, from Cheshire. He said: \"People managed to get out of the way as he was beeping as he went through - but as he went past, people were obviously very angry and so started running after the car. \"The back window of the car was already smashed. \"I thought that once it went past us, it was just someone that was trying to get away from something and would slow down when he got to more people.\" Dan Ogunshakin, a BBC Sport reporter, had travelled to Liverpool for the day with a friend to see his team lift the trophy. As he was walking up Water Street, he noticed the car that, unbeknown to him, others had tried to stop further up the road. \"We wondered what it was doing there,\" Dan said. \"Suddenly people surrounded the car. \"They were banging it, shaking it, rocking it. It was joyous and then suddenly everything changed.\" This time the number of people trying to intervene and block the car from going any further was much larger than earlier. Footage from the scene shows a frantic mass swarming the car and police officers moving in. Dan described a \"large bang\" as the car hit an ambulance parked behind it. \"Then it just [moved] forward [and] accelerated very quickly into the crowd,\" he added. One witness who spoke to BBC Radio 5 Live saw how the man at the wheel reacted to the chaos unfolding around his vehicle. Harry Rashid said: \"I could see the driver of the vehicle... my wife saw him clearly. \"He looked emotional, agitated, his hands were moving about. \"He was trying to close the door of the car because people were trying to pull the door open. \"When he closed the door people were banging on the vehicle, the windscreens, the side windows, the back window. \"Within the next five seconds he managed to put his car into gear again and drive straight through the people in front of him.\" Nobody knows what was going through the driver's mind, or why he was attempting to take a large car down the packed road in the first place. Police say a 53-year-old white British man from the West Derby area of Liverpool is in custody and being questioned on suspicion of attempted murder, dangerous driving and driving while unfit through drugs. Most of those around the car managed to scatter as it lurched forward, picking up speed - but not everyone got out of the way. One man was seen being thrown onto the bonnet and bouncing off the windscreen, before falling to the ground. Then the car veered right towards a tightly packed part of the crowd clustered on a pavement outside a Hooters bar, creating a sickening domino effect as people careered into one another. Others were pulled along with the car or hurled to the floor. Daniel Eveson's partner was dragged under the car's wheels and his baby son's pram tossed down the street. For a moment, he did not know if his partner or son had survived. Describing the scene, he said he saw \"people going flying and people screaming and just terror, pure terror\", adding: \"I thought I'd lost everything.\" \"I saw a gentleman on the bonnet and the rest was just chaos,\" Mr Eveson, from Telford, Shropshire, told BBC Radio Shropshire. The car struck him in the chest before his partner went under its wheels and was dragged down the road. Meanwhile, the impact spun their son's pram about four-and-a-half metres (15ft) down the street. Mr Eveson was able to locate his son, who was unharmed, and leave him in a restaurant with helpers as he went back to search for his partner. Another personin the car's path was BBC reporter Matt Cole, who had taken his family along to the celebrations. He said an ambulance had just made its way through the \"dense\" crowd when \"there were screams ahead of us\". \"[The car] just wasn't stopping,\" he recounted. \"I managed to grab my daughter who was with me and jump out of the way. \"It missed myself and my family by literally inches.\" Among the 50 people treated in hospital - 11 of whom were still in hospital on Tuesday - were an adult and child who sustained serious injuries. No one lost their lives. Jack Trotter, who had travelled to Liverpool from Northern Ireland to celebrate his club's triumph, was one of those injured. He describedbeing in \"absolute agony\"but said he was \"extremely lucky\" as he managed to move partly out the way as the car came towards him. Paul, who had visited from North Yorkshire, said: \"We just heard this screaming, and we saw coming to car coming to us. \"It was panic, my daughters were just screaming and just wanted to go home. It was so horrific to watch.\" Another of those hurt was a paramedic, who was stationed inside the crowd on a bicycle. Steve, from Chester, told BBC Radio Merseyside he saw the paramedic being struck, and recounted how he, his wife and friend ran down a side street to find safety. \"We didn't know what was happening, you just want to find somewhere as safe as you can,\" he added. Within seconds of the car ploughing through the crowd and coming to a halt, a large crowd had surrounded it again, including several police officers flooding down the road. Footage from the scene shows the crowd desperately lashing out at the car in an attempt to prevent the driver doing further harm. \"They were extremely brave,\" Steve said. \"If it hadn't been for their action the vehicle would have carried on going down the street, I'm convinced.\"",

    "title": "How political chaos helped forge South Korea's presidential frontrunner",
    "article_text": "Before the events of 3 December 2024, Lee Jae–myung's path to South Korea's presidency was littered with obstacles. Ongoing legal cases, investigations for corruption and allegations of abusing power all looked set to derail the former opposition leader's second presidential bid. Then a constitutional crisis changed everything. On that night, former president Yoon Suk Yeol's abortive attempt to invoke martial law set in motion a series of events that appears to have cleared the path for Lee. Now, as the Democratic Party candidate, he is the frontrunner to win South Korea's election on 3 June. It's a dramatic reversal of fortunes for the 61-year-old, who at the time of Yoon's martial law declaration stood convicted of making false statements during his last presidential campaign in 2022. Those charges still cast a long shadow over Lee, and could yet threaten his years-long pursuit of the top job. But they are also just the latest in a string of controversies that have dogged him throughout his political career. A rags-to-riches origin story combined with a bullish political style has made Lee into a divisive figure in South Korea. \"Lee Jae-myung's life has been full of ups and downs, and he often takes actions that stir controversy,\" Dr Lee Jun-han, professor of political science and international studies at Incheon National University, tells the BBC. These actions typically include attempts at progressive reform – such as a pledge, made during his 2022 presidential campaign, to implement universal basic income scheme – which challenge the existing power structure and status quo in South Korea. \"Because of this, some people strongly support him, while others distrust or dislike him,\" Dr Lee says. \"He is a highly controversial and unconventional figure – very much an outsider who has made a name for himself in a way that doesn't fit traditional Democratic Party norms.\" In a recent memoir, Lee described his childhood as \"miserable\". Born in 1963 in a mountain village in Andong, Gyeongbuk Province, he was the fifth of five sons and two daughters, and - due to his family's difficult circumstances - skipped middle school to illegally enter the workforce. As a young factory worker, Lee suffered an industrial accident where his fingers got caught in a factory power belt, and at the age of 13 suffered a permanent injury to his arm after his wrist was crushed by a press machine. Lee later applied for and was allowed to sit entrance exams for high school and university, passing in 1978 and 1980 respectively. He went on to study law with a full scholarship, and passed the Bar Examination in 1986. In 1992, he married his wife Kim Hye-kyung, with whom he has two children. He worked as a human rights lawyer for almost two decades before entering politics in 2005, joining the social-liberal Uri Party, a predecessor of the Democratic Party of Korea and the ruling party at the time. While his poor upbringing has drawn scorn from members of South Korea's upper class, Lee's success in building his political career from the ground up has earned him support from working-class voters and those who feel disenfranchised by the political elite. He was elected mayor of Seongnam in 2010, rolling out a series of free welfare policies during his tenure, and in 2018 became governor of the broader Gyeonggi Province. Lee would go on to receive acclaim for his response to the Covid-19 pandemic, during which he clashed with the central government due to his insistence on providing universal relief grants for all residents of the province. It was also during this time that Lee became the Democratic Party's final presidential candidate for the first time in October 2021 – losing by 0.76 percentage points. Less than a year later, in August 2022, he was elected as the party's leader. From that point on, Dr Lee says, Lee dialled back on the controversial, fire-and-brimstone approach for which he had become notorious – opting instead to play it safe and keep a low profile. \"After [Lee's] term as a governor, his reformist image faded somewhat as he focused more on his presidential ambitions,\" he says. \"Still, on certain issues – like addressing past wrongs [during the Japanese colonial era], welfare and corruption – he has built a loyal and passionate support base by taking a firm and uncompromising stance.\" This uncompromising attitude has its detractors, with many members and supporters of the ruling People Power Party (PPP) viewing Lee as aggressive and abrasive in his approach. Lee's political career has also been marred by a series of scandals – including a drink driving incident in 2004, disputes with relatives in the late 2010s and allegations of an extramarital affair that emerged in 2018. While in other parts of the world voters have shown forgiveness and even support for controversial politicians, in South Korea – a country that is still relatively conservative in what it expects of public figures – such scandals have not typically played well. In recent years, Lee's political ambitions have been saddled with even more pressing controversies - including the ongoing legal cases that continue to hang over him, threatening to hamstring if not scuttle his chances at election. One of these concerns a string of high-profile charges, including corruption, bribery and breach of trust, associated with a land development project in 2023. Another, perhaps more critical legal battle concerns allegations that Lee made a knowingly false statement during a debate in the last presidential campaign. During the debate, which aired on South Korean television in December 2021, Lee had denied personally knowing Kim Moon-ki, a key figure in a corruption-ridden land development scandal who had taken his own life just days earlier. Prosecutors allege that claim was false, thus violating the Public Official Election Act, and in November 2024 Lee was convicted of the false statements charge and given a one-year suspended prison sentence. Then, in March, an appeals court cleared him of the charges – only for that ruling to be overturned by South Korea's Supreme Court. At the time of writing, the case is still awaiting a verdict. Other threats against Lee's future political ambitions posed a more fatal danger. In January 2024, while answering questions from reporters outside the construction site of a planned airport in Busan, Lee was stabbed in the neck by a man who had approached him asking for an autograph. The injury to Lee's jugular vein, though requiring extensive surgery, was not critical - but he now campaigns behind bulletproof glass, wearing a bulletproof vest, surrounded by agents carrying ballistic briefcases. The assailant, who had written an eight-page manifesto and wanted to ensure that Lee never became president, was later sentenced to 15 years in prison. The attack raised concerns about deepening political polarisation in South Korea - embodied perhaps most publicly in the bitter rivalry between Lee and Yoon, and more privately in the country's increasingly extreme online discourse. In December 2023, just weeks before Lee was attacked, a survey sponsored by the newspaper Hankyoreh found that more than 50% of respondents said they felt South Korea's political divide worsening. Some claim that, as Democratic Party leader, Lee played a major role in fuelling the problem, frequently blocking motions by Yoon's government and effectively rendering him a lame duck president. Such constant stonewalling by the Democratic Party only exacerbated Yoon's leadership struggles - which also included repeated impeachment attempts against administration officials and constant opposition to his budget. Finally, as the pressure against him mounted, the former president took the drastic step of declaring martial law. Yoon's declaration of martial law on 3 December - made in a self-proclaimed bid to eliminate \"anti-state forces\" and North Korea sympathisers - served as the catalyst for Lee to emerge as a leading presidential candidate. Within hours of the declaration, Lee appealed to the public via a livestream broadcast and urged them to assemble in protest outside the National Assembly building in central Seoul. Thousands responded, clashing with police and blocking military units as opposition lawmakers rushed into the assembly building, clambering over fences and walls in a desperate attempt to block Yoon's order. Lee was among them, climbing over the fence to enter the National Assembly and helping to pass the resolution to lift martial law. The Democratic Party later decided to impeach President Yoon - a decision that was unanimously upheld by South Korea's Constitutional Court on 4 April, 2025. It was then that Lee began the path to a full-fledged election bid, announcing his resignation as leader of the Democratic Party on 9 April ahead of his presidential run. In the Democratic Party presidential primary held on April 27, he was selected as the general candidate with overwhelming support. The result of Yoon's abortive martial law attempt was a political maelstrom from which South Korea is still reeling: a constitutional crisis that ended the former president's career and left his PPP in tatters. But of the small few who have managed to leverage that chaos to their advantage, none have benefitted more than Lee. Now the controversial presidential candidate awaits the verdict on his political future - not only from the South Korean people, but also the courts. If his guilty ruling is ultimately confirmed, Lee will likely lose his seat in the National Assembly. As a candidate, that would prevent him from running for president for a period of five years. But with the courts having now approved Lee's request to postpone his legal hearings until after the election, another possibility has emerged: that Lee, who remains the electoral favourite, could be convicted after winning the presidency. And that could mean that South Korea, having just endured a months-long period of political turmoil, may not be done with its leadership dramas just yet. The vote comes after the impeachment and removal of former president Yoon Suk Yeol. Hundreds made damning allegations of fraud, kidnapping and trafficking about an overseas adoption programme. All six presidential candidates' names are banned in Starbucks stores to \"maintain neutrality\". Son, who was described as a \"national treasure\" led the team to its first silverware in 17 years.

    "title": "A soft knock - how police arrest a suspected paedophile",
    "article_text": "It's 07:35 in a smart suburban housing estate in central Scotland and the police are about to turn a family's life upside down. Three detectives in plain clothes park their unmarked car near a large detached house and knock on the front door. A dishevelled man suspected of sexual communication with a 13-year-old girl answers and, after a brief discussion about their search warrant, the officers go in. What we're watching is a \"soft\" approach, the polar opposite of a drugs raid. No hard knock, no battering ram, no shouts of \"police\". Their tactics mean the peace and quiet of the neighbourhood continues uninterrupted. But inside the house the ripple effects of the unannounced visit are devastating. The man's partner is told why the police are there. The couple's children want to know who the strangers are and the officers try to calm everyone down. One of the detectives, Joseph Wilson, said: \"The only thing I can compare it to in policing is delivering a death message. \"You're telling them the person isn't who they thought they were.\" Police Scotland's national child abuse investigation unit invited BBC Scotland News to witness its work amidst a marked change in offending behaviour since the Covid pandemic. Det Ch Insp Mike Smith said paedophiles were making \"extremely dangerous\" direct contact with children online more than ever before. And he warned they could do so within 30 seconds of trying. What happens next can include grooming the child, coercing them to send indecent images - which are often shared with other paedophiles - and persuading them to meet up. These encounters frequently lead to sexual abuse. Det Ch Insp Smith said the perception of online sex offenders as uploaders or downloaders of child sexual abuse material was outdated. Nearly every case now involves direct contact with a child, with offenders using a range of platforms from social media to streaming. \"For those people who have a deviant sexual interest in children, it's easier than ever to go online and engage with a child,\" he said. \"You can probably do it within 30 seconds, depending on the platform. \"That's the reality of what we have seen from investigations over the last three years.\" The unit carries out 700 child sexual abuse investigations a year - an increase of 30% since 2015. Every year, its officers are taking steps to safeguard between 600 and 800 children, almost all of them in Scotland. \"People based in Scotland are offending against Scottish children,\" said Det Chief Insp Smith. \"It's a lot closer to home these days. It's on our doorstep.\" \"We are actioning between 15 to 20 search warrants on a weekly basis across Scotland. \"Let's be perfectly blunt about it - the demand is through the roof.\" The offenders are almost always male and come from all walks of life, including teachers, lawyers and police officers. Det Insp Michelle Burns, one of the unit's senior investigating officers, said: \"My team have told me of occasions where they've went in, and someone has admitted to it and said it was a relief that the police were at their door. \"They've been doing it for a period of time and they were looking for help.\" Many of the cases come through referrals from theNational Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, an American organisation which receives alerts from the tech industry. Investigations are prioritised on the basis of the risk to children, either within the offender's household or the wider community. When they execute the search warrant, the police have to gather evidence, arrest the suspect, safeguard any children who are there and do what they can to minimise the impact on the rest of the family. At the address in central Scotland, Det Con Helena Scott took devices from the house to a specially-equipped van where their contents were forensically examined. \"The problem we have with this type of crime is it's relentless,\" she said. \"You feel like you're making a difference and the next day you come in, the pile just gets higher and higher and higher, because there are more and more offenders out there and it's not slowing down. \"Children should have the right to use online platform without them and their parents worrying about strangers trying to take advantage of their vulnerabilities for their own sexual gratification.\" As the team continues its work, children in neighbouring homes start to leave to go to school. A resident approaches the detectives to ask what is going on. They reassure her they are police officers but reveal nothing beyond that. Det Con Scott recalled another case where the suspect's partner asked how long she had to move house, before the local community found out what had happened. She said: \"The hardest part of our job is dealing with the families, because there's only ever one person responsible for what brings us to the door. \"You're effectively turning lives upside down. \"It has a huge impact on us as well because it's difficult for us to see it unravel.\" Det Ch Insp Smith said online platforms need to do far more to prevent paedophiles making contact with children. He said: \"Whilst we don't want to place the onus of responsibility on the child, we have to educate our children to be safe online and just like the physical world, one of the key aspects of that is that you shouldn't be engaging with someone you don't know. \"I do believe it should be a lot harder for a child to be able to engage with a random person online. \"There's responsibility on tech, there's responsibility on government, there's responsibility on the police to make the online world safer. \"But there has to be an understanding that this is a global worldwide problem and therefore we need as a society to change the way we view the internet.\" A few hours after they arrived, the detectives led the 43-year-old man out of the house in handcuffs to be driven to a police station in Falkirk. It is the start of a long legal journey which will eventually establish guilt or innocence. The man was charged in connection with sexual communications and will appear in court at a later date. Twenty people were arrested after thousands of Celtic fans gathered for an unofficial party to mark their club's success. The Survive charity has a waiting list of about 700 people, with survivors often needing complex support. The appeal follows the stabbings of two teenagers on different beaches at the weekend, resulting in one death. An investigation into the illicit mining sector reveals a world of child exploitation. Ch Supt Pat Campbell was arrested and charged following an incident at a property in Airdrie last month.",

    "title": "The tiny island where puffins are thriving despite global decline",
    "article_text": "A record number of puffins have been recorded on a small island off the Pembrokeshire coast, despite global populations declining rapidly. According to the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales (WTSWW), 43,626 puffins were counted on Skomer Island this year - a record high. The WTSWW said the increased number of puffins on the nature reserve was a \"conservation success story\", but warned that the birds were still a species under threat which should continue to be protected. Skomer Island, a 2.92km² internationally important seabird island managed by the WTSWW, is located less than a mile from the Pembrokeshire coast. The island's isolation means that it is protected from predators such as rats, cats, dogs and foxes, and also from the human impact on the mainland. As well as a growing population of puffins, Skomer is also home to 350,000 breeding pairs of manx shearwaters and thousands of guillemots and razorbills. Every year, the WTSWW undertakes its annual seabird count on the island to monitor the population of birds that return every spring to breed. The puffins are counted during the evening and early in the season by six members of staff. Skomer Island's visitor officer, Rob Knott, said counting the birds was \"quite a job\". \"We split the island into sections and we go round about two hours before sunset when there's the most on the land,\" he said. \"We get our clickers out and we count all the ones on the land, then the sea and the ones in the air as well.\" The last record was set in 2023, when 42,513 puffins were recorded on and around the island. \"We think [the counting accuracy] is probably within a few hundred or perhaps a thousand birds,\" said Rob. \"Of course, that number is not going to be dead on the right number of puffins that are here, but because we do it in the same way every year and record those birds in the same way, it's always been reported as the final number of that count that we do every year.\" Although the puffins seem to be thriving in Pembrokeshire, there is a rapid decline elsewhere. Like many seabird species, puffins are listed as vulnerable to extinction on the global International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list, as they face pollution, food shortages and climate change. According to the WTSWW, the growth in Skomer Island's puffin population is \"likely linked to the abundance of food in the wider area, meaning there is plenty of fish for chicks resulting in high breeding success\". They said the absence of rats and other predators on the island had also contributed to the seabirds' success.

    "title": "Keep calm and carry on - Draper gets off French Open mark",
    "article_text": "British men's number one Jack Draper is making his third main-draw appearance at the French Open Britain's Jack Draper says trusting his tennis would \"click into place\" was the key to earning the first French Open win of his career. Draper, seeded fifth, moved through the gears to secure a 3-6 6-1 6-4 6-2 victory against Italy's Mattia Bellucci. The British men's number one lost on his first two appearances at Roland Garros but has returned this year as a genuine force on the clay. After beating 68th-ranked Bellucci, Draper said he is still learning the benefits of being more patient in the five-set format at Grand Slam events. \"When I lost the first set today, I wasn't panicking at all,\" he said. \"In a three-set match for instance, I'm usually quite aggressive and quite full on all the time, whereas in Grand Slams you just can't be like that because the match is just too long. \"I did a really good job of staying calm and knowing that my tennis was going to click into place.\" The 23-year-old Englishman's victory ensured six British singles players won in the French Open first round for the first time since 1973. Draper, who was the final Briton to play his opening match, came through to join Cameron Norrie, Jacob Fearnley, Emma Raducanu, Katie Boulter and Sonay Kartal in the second round. 'I think I deserve a diploma' - Norrie stuns Medvedev Djokovic makes winning start to French Open bid How can Raducanu stun the 'Queen of Clay'? Draper's previous trips to Roland Garros have been memorable for the wrong reasons. The left-hander retired during his main-draw debut two years ago and lamented being known as \"the guy who is injured a lot\", before struggling with his serve in a miserable defeat against 176th-ranked Jesper de Jong last year. This year, he has returned as different proposition - and with a point to prove. \"To win my first match here feels amazing,\" Draper said. \"But I'm coming here wanting to go deep in the tournament. I have the confidence and I have the belief I can do that. \"Winning matches feels good, but my goals are much higher than that.\" Kartal postpones tattoo appointment for doubles match 'OK, no racquets...' - but Gauff still progresses Azarenka through with 48-minute 'double bagel' win Over the past 12 months, Draper has enjoyed a steep rise and achieved a series of notable career landmarks. He has moved into the world's top five after reaching his first Grand Slam semi-final at last year's US Open, winning ATP titles on grass and hard courts, as well as reaching his first clay-court final in Madrid last month. Observers with a deep understanding of the game have long insisted Draper has the ability to perform well on the red dirt, with British former world number four Tim Henman telling BBC Sport recently his best attributes - his left-handed serve and crunching forehand -could \"work on any surface\". Once he got going against Bellucci, Draper proved that again. Cutting out double faults helped his first serve became increasingly dominant - climbing from 58% of points won with the opening shot in the first set to 92% in the second - while the volume of forehand winners also increased. The venom of this shot was too hot for Bellucci to handle - and wowed the Paris crowd, who regularly gasped at Draper's power and accuracy. Draper's next opponent will be France's Gael Monfils, who came from two sets down to defeat Bolivia's Hugo Dellien in Tuesday's evening match. In the opening game, Monfils lost his footing while attempting to play a forehand and stumbled heavily into a courtside advertising board. The 38-year-old received treatment to his hand and knee but still appeared to be hampered in subsequent games. However, world number 42 Monfils stormed back to complete a 4-6 3-6 6-1 7-6 (7-4) 6-1 victory, delighting his home crowd on Court Philippe Chatrier.

    "article_text": "Emma Raducanu has lost all four of her previous matches against Iga Swiatek Raducanu v Swiatek - French Open 2025 Date:29 MayVenue:Court Philippe Chatrier, Roland Garros Coverage:Live radio commentary on 5 Live Sport and BBC Sounds, plus live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app Eyes were inevitably drawn to the possibility of Emma Raducanu facing four-time champion Iga Swiatek in the French Open second round when the draw was made last week. Even Britain's Raducanu admitted she could not avoid the talk of what might lie ahead. The 22-year-old showed physical and mental resilience to beat Wang Xinyu on Monday - but victory over Swiatek, nicknamed the 'Queen of Clay', in Paris is one of the toughest tasks in the women's game. \"It's a tall mountain to climb,\" said former British number one Annabel Croft, who will be covering the match for BBC Radio 5 Live. \"But it's not a foregone conclusion because Swiatek has suffered a lot of losses this year.\" Before the pair meet at about 15:30 BST on Wednesday, BBC Sport analyses how Raducanu can cause a shock against the world number five. 'I think I deserve a diploma' - Norrie stuns Medvedev 'OK, no racquets...' - but Gauff still progresses Djokovic makes winning start to French Open bid Since claiming her first French Open title as a teenager in 2020, Swiatek has built a formidable record on the Paris clay. She has won four of the past five tournaments - and the statistics underline her dominance: 22 victories in a row 36 wins in 38 French Open matches Zero defeats since 2021 However, the 23-year-old's reign isunder more threat than ever. Swiatek has not reached a final since her title triumph in Paris last year and had, by her high standards, a below-par clay-court swing. \"She has a real problem with her forehand down the line, and players know that,\" former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash told BBC Radio 5 Live before the tournament. \"She might be able to get away with it on clay because she's so fast and can keep pulling players out of position. \"But it is a real liability on other surfaces and now it's a problem on the clay. \"She'll hit one, miss one, hit one, miss one; you can't do that. You need to be hitting 20 points in a row before you make the mistake.\" This video can not be played 'Her game is a mess' - How can Swiatek return to form? One of the biggest natural strengths in Raducanu's game has been her backhand, but the forehand has become an increasingly useful weapon. \"I think her forehand has developed into one of the best aspects of her game,\" Croft said. \"I really like the cross-court forehand - it has height, it travels and she is dangerous on the run with it. \"But against an athlete like Swiatek, more of them generally come back.\" Raducanu, who has climbed up to 41st in the rankings after an encouraging few months, has previously had little joy against Swiatek. The 2021 US Open champion has lost all four of their previous meetings - twice on indoor clay in Stuttgart, and twice on hard courts at Indian Wells and this year's Australian Open. The 6-1 6-0 defeat in Melbourne was particularly chastening, with Swiatek's groundstrokes proving too powerful and precise for Raducanu. \"She gets really fired up when she plays me - I don't know why that is but she's always played really well,\" Raducanu told BBC Sport. \"I'm not sure if it is a me thing but every time we have played she has been high level.\" Raducanu has improved in the four months since they last met, but the way she was outclassed by world number two Coco Gauff on the Madrid clay showed the gap she still has to bridge. \"Against a top quality opponent who is not going to go away psychologically, that's where you are going to see where Raducanu's game is at,\" said Croft. \"She knows she has to come out and be aggressive against Swiatek. She won't get away with just pushing the ball around. \"She will need to get the first strike in and will also need to get depth â or angle - to try and control the point. \"If you start to play catch-up against Swiatek in a rally you will come out second best.\" Raducanu was criticised earlier in her career for seemingly not being tough enough to get through matches when she was not feeling 100%. She has made encouraging strides with her fitness this season and developed greater trust in her body. That has provided the base for Raducanu to show more resilience in deciding sets, as she did successfully against Wang. \"I have had a lot more three-set matches this year and come out successful more than in the past, which gives me more confidence,\" Raducanu said. Raducanu woke up feeling \"sick\" before her first-round match and any hint she is lacking energy on Wednesday will be exposed by Swiatek. But she offered a reassuring update in her post-match news conference. \"I feel better. I had a good amount of food,\" added the former world number 10. \"I think it was also maybe just an earlier wake-up than usual for me. Maybe my body was just lagging a little bit. \"After a good feed and some rest, I think I'll probably be OK.\" Draper recovers to earn maiden French Open win Kartal postpones tattoo appointment for doubles match Azarenka through with 48-minute 'double bagel' win Live scores, results and order of play Get tennis news sent straight to your phone",

    "title": "She made keeping cool and fought off-field battles - so why is Earps retiring now?",
    "article_text": "Mary Earps won 53 senior England caps during an eight-year international career Few international retirements have shocked women's football in the way Mary Earps' decision did. Two years after winning back-to-back Fifa Best goalkeeper awards, and nine months on from ahigh-profile move to Paris St-Germain, nobody predicted that Earps would withdraw from duty five weeks before Euro 2025. England manager Sarina Wiegman admitted she was \"disappointed\", and had hoped Earps would play an \"important role\" this summer. So why has one of England's most loved footballers decided to retire now? What legacy will she leave? And what does the future look like without her? Earps announces shock England retirement after losing place Earps' position at the top of the goalkeeping pecking order came under threat last year with the emergence of Chelsea's Hannah Hampton. Wiegmansaid in Aprilthat Hampton was \"a bit ahead of Earps\" after she had started her third match in a row, including a crucial 1-0 win over world champions Spain at Wembley in the Women's Nations League. The England manager had previously been reluctant to comment on the goalkeeping battle but that statement was a strong nod towards the summer. It's understood that Earps held discussions with Wiegman before she was scheduled to join the squad at St George's Park this week about her position for the Euros. She later told her team-mates her decision on Monday and did not train, before returning home and withdrawing from upcoming matches against Portugal and Spain. Earps will have known her chances of regaining the number one spot were slimming and she admitted in her statement that it was a \"new era for England\". Having experienced setbacks with England before - most notably when she was dropped by Phil Neville following a 2-1 defeat by Germany at Wembley in 2019, not returning to the international stage for two years - she will not have been keen to experience it again. Wiegman's shock and disappointment was clear. Earps has been a vital member of England's major tournament successes, acting as a leader. Her decision to step down five weeks before Euro 2025 has rocked the squad. This video can not be played Carter praises Earps for her 'bravery' after England retirement Earps' impact on the growth of women's football and England's success has been enormous. As well as playing a key role inEngland's Euro 2022 victory, she was vice-captain as they reached the2023 World Cup final, saving a penalty in their defeat by Spain. More standout moments in theinaugural Women's Finalissimafollowed and she earned a high-profile move from Manchester United to Paris St-Germain last summer. She has also been showered with individual accolades, winning the Fifa Best goalkeeper award twice, as well as the Golden Glove for the best keeper at the 2023 World Cup. Her impact off the pitch has been as significant. She used her platform to speak out, discussing her personal mental health struggles while collecting her award at the Fifa Best event in 2023. But perhaps her most notable intervention came when she called out Nike for failing to sell England women's goalkeeper shirts before the World Cup, which led to a petition gathering more than 150,000 signatures andthe sportswear giant making a U-turn. At England games, fans would scream her name to sign autographs and take photos, while a mural outside Old Trafford was painted following Euro 2022. A plaque honouring Earps was installed in her home city, Nottingham, where she also has a tram named after her. She was also the first female footballer to have a waxwork figure made at Madame Tussauds, winning a public vote. Her status as a firm fan favourite was cemented when she won BBC's Sports Personality of the Year in 2023, showing her profile had transcended football. Earps herself said in February 2023 she wanted to make goalkeeping \"cool\" and there can be no dispute that she has done that. She went from being cast aside by Neville in 2019, to dancing on the press conference table with a Euro 2022 winners' medal around her neck and roaring in celebration as she made crucial penalty saves in 2023. Wiegman's disappointment at Earps' decision to pull out of Euro 2025 is understandable given there is little experience in the goalkeeping department. Hampton is a strong number one and has progressed this season, taking on the baton of Chelsea's first-choice goalkeeper and playing in a Women's Champions League semi-final. Six of Hampton's 13 England appearances have come in the past 15 months. There are no doubts the 24-year-old is ready. However, neither of the other two goalkeepers in England's current squad - Khiara Keating, 20, and Anna Moorhouse, 30 - have won a senior cap. Keating is still competing for Manchester City's number one spot, while Moorhouse has enjoyed success in the United States with Orlando Pride but is very much an unknown given her first England squad call-up came in July 2024. Barcelona's Ellie Roebuck, 25, is a previous England number one and started all four games for Team GB at the delayed Olympic Games in 2021. But she has found herself on the periphery under Wiegman and has not been in the squad afterrecovering from a strokelast year. Earps' international retirement leaves a significant gap in England's Euros squad. Finding someone to take that place will not be easy. Former England goalkeeper Karen Bardsley said she can understand if Wiegman is \"pretty upset\" because Earps' decision has left the Lionesses \"incredibly vulnerable\" given the lack of experienced options if Hampton gets injured. \"In a situation like this the team should be the first and foremost priority,\" she told BBC Radio 5 Live \"It is sad Mary feels that now is the right time to step down and she deserves credit, but, bigger picture, this leaves a lot of pressure on a young Hannah Hampton's shoulders.\" This video can not be played Follow PSG goalkeeper Mary Earps on a typical training day Head here to get involved Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "How Schmid screengrab reignited putter debate",
    "article_text": "There is no daylight between Matti Schmid's left thumb and his shirt, leading to discussions about whether he might be 'anchoring' his putter Germany's Matti Schmid used his broom-handle putter to address his ball as he faced another crucial tap-in en route to second place at the Charles Schwab Challenge on Sunday - his best PGA Tour finish. Briefly, the television cameras showed the top end of his club. A clenched left hand had its thumb resting on top of the grip.  His blue patterned shirt creased around the knuckle of his thumb. The image begged some questions: was that knuckle also in contact with his chest? If so, was it wedged against his sternum? Had he found a fixed anchor point? Was he breaking the rules? Or was it OK? BBC Sport has contacted Schmid's representatives, but the very fact his technique could be questioned - with no definitive answer - means a brilliant putting display could fall under an unwelcome spotlight. Rule 10.1 of the Rules of Golf states: \"When making a stroke, a player must not anchor the club\" by \"doing it 'directly', by holding the club or a 'gripping hand' against any part of the body\". There was certainly no daylight between Schmid's left thumb and his shirt, and when I showed a screengrab of the image to a leading referee he acknowledged it was a \"bad look\". But he also pointed out that the rules state: \"If the player's club, gripping hand or forearm merely touches their body or clothing during the stroke, without being held against the body, there is no breach of this rule.\" So we - as observers - do not know whether Schmid's putt was legal or not. Despitelegislation coming into effectalmost a decade ago, the issue of 'anchoring' continues to be one of the murkiest in the game. If anything, it feels as though it is becoming ever more pertinent. Schmid topped the putting stats at Colonial as he finished second to Ben Griffin. After gaining more than eight strokes on the field with his prowess on the greens, that runner-up finish propelled the two-time former European Amateur champion to 55th in the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup standings. None of this is to say the 27-year-old's action broke any rules. There may be enough lateral movement in his stroke to suggest he is not stabilising to a fixed point. But the broader topic remains one of the hottest in professional locker rooms. \"He's probably OK,\" the referee I spoke to added. \"He's probably just touching the shirt material, but by what he is trying to achieve he's going to be as close as possible to his chest, and therefore player integrity comes into it.\" Another official, who referees on the DP World Tour, said on condition of anonymity: \"It is super difficult to enforce. \"We have spoken to a couple of players who we felt were getting close to breaching the rule and they actually have gone back to shorter putters, which is good. \"But ultimately you have to go with the integrity of the players. How do you enforce it? It is your word against theirs. You're in no man's land.\" The rule was introduced in 2016 after a spate of majors were won by golfers using extended putter shafts. Keegan Bradley anchored in his midriff towin the 2011 US PGA,as did Ernie Els for hisOpen triumphthe following year. There were broom-handle major wins for Webb Simpson in the2012 US Openand Adam Scott a year laterat the Masters.The Aussie continues to use the long putter, but with daylight between his stroke and his body. Protecting the \"fundamental characteristics of the putting stroke\" was the reason for banning anchoring nine years ago. It is OK for an extended shaft to be clamped against a forearm (as US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau does) because that moves to make the hit. But there are those in the game who feel even this technique makes putting \"too easy\". And there are plenty more exponents who continue to shun convention and go with longer implements. Along with Schmid, the likes of Akshay Bhatia, Si Woo Kim and Lucas Glover use these potentially contentious clubs to great effect. Bernhard Langer and Scott McCarron have long endured their techniques being questioned on the Seniors tour, and Spaniard Eugenio Chacarra's Indian Open win on the DP World Tour last March drew focus. Langer and McCarron have vehemently denied breaching the rules. Back in 2017, Langer said: \"I personally don't understand it because I'm a man of integrity, and the last thing I want to do is break rules and be known as cheating. \"I know when I'm anchoring and when I'm not anchoring because I control my hand. It goes sideways, you can see it. \"So when my knuckle is away from the body, I'm not anchoring or touching any part of my body and I know I'm within the rules.\" The problem is that in many cases it is not evident to the naked eye and is impossible to enforce either way. It means an issue as fundamental as the putting stroke is shrouded in more grey areas than a flotilla of battleships, which is highly unsatisfactory and not fair on the likes of Schmid when they dominate so brilliantly on the greens. DP World Tour winner Eddie Pepperell believes the solution is \"quite simple\". \"Insist on the putter being the shortest club in the bag,\" he told theChipping Forecast podcast. Some referees agree. \"Easy solution is just limit the maximum length of the putter and be done with it,\" said one official. Another said: \"The powers that be should be looking at it. If there is a rule, we should be able to enforce it.\"",

    "article_text": "Presley Chweneyagae, the South African actor who gained international recognition for his leading role in the 2005 film Tsotsi, which won South Africa’s first ever Oscar for best foreign language film, has died. He was 40 years old. His talent agency MLA on Tuesday confirmed Chweneyagae’s death and said SouthAfricahad lost one of its “most gifted and beloved actors”. “His passion for empowering the next generation of artists will remain integral to his legacy,” MLA’s CEO, Nina Morris Lee, said in a statement. She gave no details about the cause of death. Chweneyagae’s three-decade-long career spanned theatre, television and film. His award-winning performance inTsotsi, based on the 1961 novel by South Africa’s pre-eminent playwright Athol Fugard and directed by Gavin Hood, catapulted him to international stardom. Chweneyagae was also a gifted writer and director, co-authoring the internationally acclaimed stage play Relativity with Paul Grootboom. The South African government paid tribute to Chweneyagae, lauding his outstanding contribution to the film, television and theatre fraternity. “The nation mourns the loss of a gifted storyteller whose talent lit up our screens and hearts,” the government said in a post on X. “Your legacy will live on through the powerful stories you told.” The South Africa Film and Television Awards organization, known as Safta, paid tribute to Chweneyagae, calling him a “true legend of South African Cinema” on X. “Rest in Power … a powerhouse performer whose talent left an indelible mark on our screens and in our hearts,” Safta posted. The secretary general of the ANC, the party that dominated South African politics for 30 years, offered his condolences. Fikile Mbalula described Chweneyagae as a “giant of South African film and theatre”. “His legacy in Tsotsi, The River, and beyond will live on. Condolences to his family, friends, and all who were touched by his brilliance,” Mbalula said.",

    "title": "Forty-two people killed in central Nigeria in attacks blamed on herders",
    "article_text": "Forty-two people have been killed in four communities in centralNigeriain attacks blamed on itinerant herders, in the latest wave of violence that continues to upend life in the rural region. Reuters reports quote a local official, Victor Omnin, the chair of the Gwer West local government area in Benue state, as saying 10 people were killed in a Saturday attack on the villages of Tyolaha and Tse-Ubiam. Thirty-two others were killed the following day in a separate attack in the nearby Ahume and Aondona villages. “It’s a pathetic situation,” Omnin told the press on Tuesday. “As we speak, we are still recovering corpses.” According to Reuters, a Catholic priest was also shot in the area by the assailants, and the office of the Benue governor, Hyacinth Iormem Alia, who is also a priest, said he had been wounded and was in a critical but stable condition. “They killed women and even children as young as two years old,” one resident of the area told the Daily Trust, which focuses on northernNigeria. Parts of central and north-western Nigeria have experienced waves of violent attacks as itinerant Fulani herders and Indigenous farmers clash when cows often left to graze openly sometimes stray on to farms. In some villages, farmers have accused herders of being initial perpetrators and then banded into vigilante groups and militia to embark on reprisal attacks. And while many analysts blame the climate crisis and overpopulation for the conflict as pastoral land diminishes across the country, the villagers allege land-grabbing and ethnic cleansing. According to Nextier’s Nigeria Violent Conflicts Database, at least 2,347 casualties were recorded in 359 incidents involving farmers and herders across Nigeria between 2020 and 2024. Some experts and locals say the numbers are conservative, as many of the incidents and fatalities are often undocumented. The situation is especially prevalent in central Nigeria, known as the middle belt, where the conflict has religious undertones as the herders are usually Muslim and the farmers Christian. In April, 56 people were reportedly killed by herders during the Easter period in Benue state. The conflict has also disrupted farming activities in Benue, an agrarian state known as the “Food Basket of the Nation” for producing significant amounts of Nigeria’s main food crops, such as yams, maize and soybeans. Last year, the Benue state government announced that it would begin full implementation of a law enacted in 2017 banning open grazing and establishing ranches. That is yet to happen, some residents of the state claim. “The relentless violence must end,” Asema Achado, a federal lawmaker, saidin a statementlast October. “Our farmers are the backbone of our economy, yet they live in constant fear.”",

    "title": "Uganda accused of ‘state bigotry’ and attacks on LGBTQ+ people",
    "article_text": "The Ugandan authorities have “unleashed abuse”, perpetrating widespread discrimination and violence againstLGBTQ+people in the two years since the world’sharshest anti-gay lawswere enacted, according to a new report by Human Rights Watch (HRW). The government’s policies inUgandahad encouraged attacks and harassment against people and organisations seen as being supportive of gay rights, said researchers from the rights group. Public figures in the east African nation have engaged in virulent homophobic rhetoric and human rights’ violations before and since the controversial law was enacted in May 2023. “Authorities have raided and suspended nongovernmental organisations, conducted arbitrary arrests and detentions, engaged in entrapment via social media and dating apps, and extorted money from LGBT people in exchange for releasing them from police custody,” said the authors ofThey’re Putting Our Lives at Risk: How Uganda’s Anti-LGBT Climate Unleashes Abuse, which was released on Monday. It said the state had created an environment allowing “impunity for attacks” and “for sexual and other forms of violence against LGBT people”. Uganda’s autocratic president, Yoweri Museveni,signed the bill into lawin May 2023 amid widespread international outrage. It prescribes the death penalty for “aggravated homosexuality”, drawing strong condemnation from human right campaigners. The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, called the legislation“shocking and discriminatory”. Researchers interviewed 59 people, including families, rights organisations, activists, journalists and parliamentarians between August 2022 and April 2025. The organisation wrote to several government offices and officials to request information, but none responded. Oryem Nyeko, a senior HRW researcher, said: “For the last two years, LGBT Ugandans have suffered a range of abuses because of the government’s wilful decision to legislate hate against them. “The Ugandan authorities need to urgently improve this environment, which enables a wide range of human rights violations and puts countless Ugandans at serious risk of abuse,” he said. The Human Rights Awareness and Promotion Forum (HRAPF) reported last July that 667 of the cases handled by its legal aid network in the previous 14 months involved human rights violations affecting 850 LGBTQ+ people. These included evictions, violence and arrests. Clare Byarugaba, a LGBTQ+ rights activist in the capital, Kampala, said: “The human cost of the draconian anti-homosexuality law is very high, and this new report by HRW provides further evidence of the consequences of Uganda’s state sponsored homophobia and transphobia. “Continued enforcement legitimises discrimination, exclusion and violence. We need protection, not criminalisation,” she said, adding that the bill was unconstitutional and did not reflect the values of a democratic nation. “We want to live in Uganda as productive citizens without the threat of criminalisation and violence at every waking moment,” she said. “Our human rights are inherent and have never been up for debate.” Uganda’s human rights record continues to deteriorate under Museveni’s four-decade-long rule. HRW is calling on the authorities to stop their clampdown and put an end to hate speech. In April last year, Uganda’s constitutional courtrejected a petition to overturn the bill, upholding its most radical and abusive provisions. Nyeko said: “The state-sanctioned bigotry and discrimination that has only become more entrenched in Uganda over the past two years has no place in a society that upholds human rights and the rule of law. “Uganda should end its assault on LGBT people and choose a future of dignity, equality and freedom for all those who live there,” he said.",

    "title": "Poorest 750 nations face ‘tidal wave’ of debt repayments to China in 2025, study warns",
    "article_text": "The most vulnerable nations on Earth are facing a “tidal wave” of debt repayments as a Chinese lending boom starts to be called in, a new report has warned. The analysis, published on Tuesday by Australian foreign policy thinktank the Lowy Institute, said that in 2025 the poorest 75 countries were on the hook for record high debt repayments US$22bn to China. The 75 nations’ debt formed the bulk of the total $35bn calculated by Lowy for 2025. “Now, and for the rest of this decade,Chinawill be more debt collector than banker to the developing world,” the report said. The pressure to repay was putting strain on local funding for health and education as well as climate change mitigation. “China’s lending has collapsed exactly when it is needed most, instead creating large net financial outflows when countries are already under intense economic pressure,” it said. The loans were largely issued under President Xi Jinping’s signature belt and road initiative (BRI), a state-backed global infrastructure investment programme which has underwritten national projects from schools, bridges and hospitals to major roads and shipping and air ports. The lending spree turned China into thelargest supplier of bilateral loans, peaking with a total of more than $50bn in 2016 – more than all western creditors combined. The BRIfocused primarily in developing nations, where governments struggled to access private or other state-backed investment. But the practice has raised concerns aboutChinese influence and controland drawn accusations that Beijing was seeking to entrap recipient nations with unserviceable debt. Last month another analysis by the Lowy Institute found thatLaos was now trapped in a severe debt crisis, in part because of over-investment in the domestic energy sector, mostly financed by China. China’s government denies accusations it deliberately creates debt traps, and recipient nations have also pushed back, saying China was a more reliable partner and offered crucial loans when others refused. But the Lowy report said the record high debt now due to China could be used for “political leverage”, noting that it comes amid huge cuts to foreign aid by the Trump administration. The report also highlighted new large-scale loans given to Honduras, Nicaragua, Solomon Islands, Burkina Faso and the Dominican Republic, all within 18 months of those countries switching diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to Beijing. China also continues to finance some strategic partners, including Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Laos and Mongolia, as well as countries that produce critical minerals and metals, such as Argentina, Brazil and Indonesia. But the situation also put China in a bind, pulled between diplomatic pressure torestructure unsustainable debt in vulnerable nationsand domestic pressure to recall loans amid China’s own economic downturn. China publishes little data on its BRI scheme, and the Lowy Institute said its estimates – based on World Bank data – likely underestimated the full scale of China’s lending. In 2021 AidData estimatedChina was owed a “hidden debt”of about $385bn.",

    "title": "King Charles hails ‘strong and free’ Canada in speech to open parliament",
    "article_text": "King Charleshas said Canadians can “give themselves far more than any foreign power on any continent can ever take away” as he gave a rare speech in the country’s parliament that served as a rebuke of the US president,Donald Trump, and his threats to annex the country. Charles, who serves asCanada’s head of state, is the first monarch since 1957 to preside over the opening of a new Canadian parliament. In a speech attended by lawmakers, Indigenous leaders and dignitaries, Charles, on his 20th visit, praised a country he said he loved “so much”. “The True North is indeed strong and free,” he said – a reference to both the Canadian national anthem and recent threats from Trump to makeCanadathe 51st state. The speech from the throne is typically given by the governor general and is meant to outline the government’s plans for the next session. The speech is written by the prime minister’s office in consultation with staff at the king’s office. The king made no direct reference to Trump but his language was closely watched for implicit criticisms of the US president and his dramatic recasting of the US relationship with Canada. “Democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, self-determination and freedom are values which Canadians hold dear, and ones which the government is determined to protect,” said Charles, telling attenders, that by “staying true to Canadian values”, the country could “build new alliances and a new economy that serves all Canadians”. The king alluded to efforts to ease tensions with the US. “The prime minister and the president of the United States, for example, have begun defining a new economic and security relationship between Canada and the US, rooted in mutual respect and founded on common interests, to deliver transformational benefits for both sovereign nations.” Sitting next to Queen Camilla, the king also alluded to the last time a monarch opened a new parliament nearly seven decades earlier, when his late mother visited Ottawa. Queen Elizabeth said during her 1957 speech that “against the backdrop of international affairs, no nation could live unto itself”. Charles said that he took great pride in the way in which “Canada has continued to set an example to the world in her conduct and values, as a force for good.” The symbolic visit came as Canadians remain uncertain of what role they want the monarchy to play in the future. In 2023, polling firm Ipsos polling found nearly 70% of Canadians said the royal family should not play a prominent role in Canadian society. But that figure has dropped to 56%in new polling released Tuesday, showing a warming towards the monarchy, in part due to a deteriorating relationship with the US. Still, not every party in parliament supported the presence of Charles. The separatist Bloc Québécois was absent – as they typically are during the speech – in protest of the address by a “foreign king”. “To assert Canada’s sovereignty, we seek the symbol of the fact that Canada has the King of England as its sovereign,” said leader Yves-François Blanchet in the days leading up to the speech. “There is a complete inconsistency which seems to reflect [prime minister Mark]Carney’s personal sympathies rather than a relevant reading of Quebec’s sensibility.” Representatives of Inuit, Métis and First Nations peoples were present in the senate after welcoming the king to Ottawa on Monday. Indigenous leaders have described the visit as a meaningful reminder of the centuries-long bond between Canada’s first inhabitants and the British crown – the two signatories of the many treaties which created the foundations of what would later become Canada. “The King’s visit is an opportunity to highlight the nation-to-nation relationship between First Nations and the Crown. We are allies with a sacred perpetual relationship that cannot be broken,” Assembly of First Nations national Cindy Woodhouse Nepinak said in a statement. “The British Crown and First Nations are foundational to the creation of Canada. We also are distinct nations bound together by peace and friendship.” Woodhouse Nepinak said Charles, as King of Canada, “carries a responsibility to uphold the Treaties that protect our rights”.",

    "article_text": "Argentina has ratified its decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization (WHO) during a visit to Buenos Aires by the US health secretary,Robert F Kennedy Jr. The decision to pull out of the WHO wasinitially announced in Februaryby Argentina’s president, Javier Milei, following in the footsteps of his US counterpart Donald Trump who had said in January the United States would withdraw. Milei’s government justified its departure from the UN agency in a statement on Monday. “The WHO’s prescriptions do not work because they are not based on science but on political interests and bureaucratic structures that refuse to review their own mistakes,” the statement said. Buenos Aires has previously accused the agency of “disastrous” management during the Covid pandemic with its “caveman quarantine”. The announcement came as Kennedy and the Argentinian health minister, Mario Lugones, met to define “a joint work agenda that will strengthen transparency and trust in the health system”. “Together with Robert Kennedy, we believe in the future of collaboration in global health. We have similar visions about the path forward,” Lugones said. Kennedy, a controversial Trump pick for health secretary given his vaccine skepticism, is also expected to meet with Milei during his visit. In a video broadcast at the WHO’s annual assembly last week, he urged other governments to withdraw from the agency and create other institutions. In his speech, Kennedy alleged that the UN health agency was under undue influence from China, gender ideology and the pharmaceutical industry. The Argentinian government also announced a “structural review” of national health agencies to “organize, update, and make transparent the structures and processes” of the health system “that for years operated with overlaps, outdated regulations and limited oversight”.",

    "title": "‘We carry on with the sadness’: new projects honor life and legacy of Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira",
    "article_text": "Three years after the British journalistDom Phillips and the Brazilian activist Bruno Pereirawere murdered in theAmazon, two major new projects will celebrate their lives and work – and the Indigenous communities and rainforests both men sought to protect. Friends of Phillips have completed the book he was writing at the time of his death – How to Save the Amazon – which will be published in the UK, the US andBrazilon 27 May. The book aims to highlight solutions for preserving the world’s largest tropical rainforest, focusing primarily on the experiences of itsIndigenous peoplesand other inhabitants. Phillips had completed less than half of it at the time of his death. “Finishing it was important to show that Dom and Bruno’s voices were not silenced,” saidPhillips’ widow, Alessandra Sampaio, who oversaw the project. Meanwhile, a new Guardian podcast series,Missing in the Amazon, will be released on 5 June to mark the third anniversary oftheir murders in the remote Javari valley region. The podcast is the fruit of a three-year investigation by Tom Phillips, the Guardian’s Latin American correspondent, who joined the 10-day search for Dom Phillips and Pereira after they vanished in June 2022. “When discussing the case, everybody talked about the British journalist and the Brazilian Indigenous expert, but I don’t know if we ever really found out so much about who these men were,” said Phillips. “I don’t think we ever heard so much from the people who loved them, cared about them and respected them – about who they were, where they came from, why they were doing what they were doing. And that’s something that we’ve tried to make a big part of the podcast,” he added. “This podcast is about Dom and Bruno – told by the people who knew them best, many of whom are speaking for the first time,” said Nicole Jackson, the Guardian’s global head of audio. “It’s also the story of what Dom and Bruno cared so much about: the Amazon and the Indigenous people who are trying to protect it. It’s about their future and the future of the world’s biggest rainforest.” Pereira and Phillips wereambushed and killednear the Amazon town of Atalaia do Norte while returning from a reporting trip to the edge of theJavari valley, one of Brazil’s largest Indigenous territories. Soon after the men’s remains were found, Sampaio and some of Phillips’s closest friends decided to complete his unfinished book. “Everybody deals with grief differently and, in this case, it was grief mixed with horror and anger,” said Jonathan Watts, the Guardian’s global environment editor, who helped plan the project, alongside Sampaio, Phillips’ literary agent, Rebecca Carter, and the journalists Andrew Fishman, David Davies and Tom Hennigan. “Everyone knew that this book had to be finished,” said Fishman, a co-founder of the Intercept Brasil. “It would be completely unthinkable to let what happened to them be the end of Dom’s project.” The first step in the process was understanding how much Phillips had already written. Sampaio handed Fishman a black suitcase that had belonged to her husband, filled with reporter’s notebooks, laptops, old mobile phones and external hard drives. “Dom was extremely organised, but not the greatest at encryption. So it was relatively easy to get all his work together,” he said. Phillips’s notes, however, proved more challenging, due to his idiosyncratic handwriting; in the end they had to be “translated” by one of his sisters, Sian, and an old friend, John Mitchell. Once they were able to review the material, the editorial team concluded that Phillips had completed the introduction and three and a half chapters – and left notes and outlines for another six. The team decided the work should be completed by reporters who had known Dom and were also experts in covering the Amazon, selecting Tom Phillips, the Brazilian reporter Eliane Brum, former Reuters reporter Stuart Grudgings and the New Yorker’s Jon Lee Anderson. The Indigenous leader Beto Marubo and activist Helena Palmquist wrote the afterword. “It was an extraordinarily healing and uplifting process to get to know these people – these friends of Dom’s who I had had no connection with before,” said Carter, to whom Phillips first pitched the book in 2020. “We were suddenly very much united by his loss – and also the determination to make this happen.” All of the contributors waived their fees, but to cover the costs of logistically complex reporting trips to the Amazon, the book relied on a fellowship from the Alicia Patterson Foundation (awarded to Phillips in 2021), grants from Whiting Creative and the Fund for Investigative Journalism, a donation from Teresa Bracher, and support from hundreds of crowdfunding backers. Other journalists volunteered to edit the manuscript, and photographers contributed their images to the book. Dozens more supported the project in other ways – from factchecking to helping with outreach and social media. Although it is Phillips’s book, Pereira is an essential character. The two men first met in 2018 during areporting trip to the Javari for the Guardian, and Dom deeply admired Bruno’s work. Investigations concluded thatthe killers had targeted Pereirain retaliation for his efforts to combat illegal fishing – often backed by organised crime – in the Javari valley. The murders took place during the environmentally catastrophic 2019-2023 administration of the far-right president Jair Bolsonaro, who was widely criticized for his sluggish response to the disappearances of Phillips and Pereira and called their trip “an ill-advised adventure”. Since defeating Bolsonaro in the 2022 election, the leftist presidentLuiz Inácio Lula da Silvahas made the Indigenous cause and the Amazon priorities, launching major operations to evict illegal miners from areas such as the Yanomami and Kayapó territories and achieving a major reduction in deforestation. However, Marubo – who was close friends with Pereira and works for the Javari valley Indigenous association – said that despite noticeable improvements since Bolsonaro’s departure, Lula’s effortswere still falling short: “You can’t fight illegality and the spread of organised crime with two or three isolated operations … We need government action that is continuous and coordinated,” he said. “Unfortunately, if Dom and Bruno were working here today, they would be killed again,” he said. Three local men were later charged with their murders, while a fourth has been charged withordering the crime. All are in custody awaiting trial. “I strongly believe in justice,” said Sampaio, Phillips’s widow. “We hope for things to move more quickly, but my lawyers have told me that the case is progressing as it should,” she said. Sampaio, Marubo and other book contributors have travelled to the UK to take part in launch events at theHay festival (31 May), inLancaster (3 June)and inLondon (5 June). “It makes me very happy that the book has been completed,” said Sampaio. “We carry on with the sadness, but we carry on because we must.” How to Save the Amazon: A Journalist’s Deadly Quest for Answersis published in the UK, US and Brazil on 27 May. The first two episodes ofMissing in the Amazonwill be released on 5 June.",

    "title": "Trump indicates ‘positive’ progress in US-EU trade talks",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump has indicated there has been progress in US trade talks with the EU, helping send share prices rising on Wall Street, after he commended the bloc for calling to “quickly establish meeting dates”. “I have just been informed that the EU has called to quickly establish meeting dates. This is a positive event, and I hope that they will,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Tuesday, saying the EU would be “very happy and successful” if it agreed a deal. However, the president also repeated criticism of Brussels’ negotiators and defended his decision on Fridayto threaten a 50% tariff on EU importsfrom 1 June, which hepostponed two days later until 9 July. “I was extremely satisfied with the 50% tariff allotment on theEuropean Union, especially since they were slow walking (to put it mildly!), our negotiations with them,” he wrote. In what appeared to be another veiled threat on potential further tariffs, he added that he was empowered to “set a deal” if the US was “unable to make a deal” or was “treated unfairly”. Nevertheless, the president’s comments and his weekend U-turn on 50% border taxes helped lift US markets, which had been closed on Monday. The S&P 500 rose 2%, while the Dow Jones added 1.7% and the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite was up by 2.4%. Brussels sources said the way had now been cleared for detailed negotiations, with an expectation that the EU commissioner for trade, Maroš Šefčovič, would meet the US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, on the sidelines of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development meeting in Paris on Tuesday next week. A team of officials are also expected in Washington in the coming days for technical talks. However, sources said the EU’s approach had not changed, with the target being a deal in which both sides move to zero tariffs on industrial goods, and the EU buys more soya beans, arms and liquefied natural gas. Trump’s latest comments came asEmmanuel Macronwarned Vietnamese students about the consequences of impulsive superpowers in a swipe at Trump’s chaotic tariff policies. During a six-day south-east Asian tour, the French president said that “on the impulse of a superpower, everything can change”. On Trump’s policies in the US, he said tariffs were being imposed “according to the side of the bed on which he woke up”. After the weekend’s tariff flip-flopping, there is evidence that EU policymakers are scrambling to get a handle on the scale of European direct investment in the US with requests going out to industry leaders to share their investment plans. Members of the Confederation of European Business, also known as BusinessEurope, an alliance of 42 federations across the region, received a survey from the European Commission on Monday. It asked for information on upcoming US investments, with the instruction to respond as soon as possible, one source said. A similar note seeking information on investment plans for the next five years was sent to the 59-person European Round Table for Industry, which represents industry and the tech sector. The petition for information came with a note saying the request had came personally from the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion The round table’s members include the CEOs of companies including the chip equipment maker ASML, the German chemicals group BASF and the software company SAP, as well as the carmakers BMW and Mercedes-Benz. A headline figure on EU investment plans could prove critical in negotiations. Last month, Trump touted investments from US companies including the chip maker Nvidia and the pharma giant Johnson & Johnson – both of which have a large presence in Europe – as evidence that histariff strategywas paying off with the repatriation of jobs to the US. European and Asian stock markets also rose on Tuesday as investors continued to react positively to Trump’s decision to backtrack on Friday’s tariff threat. Naeem Aslam, the chief investment officer at London’s Zaye Capital Markets, told CNBC that the tariffs delay had sparked a “tentative risk-on rally”. “Looking ahead, the EU-US trade dance is a high-stakes tango, with July 9 as the next flashpoint,” he said. The EU was dangling phased tariff cuts and “mutual respect” talks, but he warned businesses to “buckle up; this ride’s far from over”.",

    "title": "New Zealand teenager dies after tackle game linked to viral Run It Straight challenge",
    "article_text": "ANew Zealandteenager has died after playing a tackling game, believed to have been inspired by a controversial new high impact collision sport trending on social media. Police confirmed the 19-year-old died in hospital on Monday night after he suffered a critical head injury while playing a tackle game with friends in the North Island city Palmerston North on Sunday. “This young man’s death is an absolute tragedy and my thoughts are with his family and friends,” Inspector Ross Grantham said. “The tackle game … was based on a social media-driven trend, where participants compete in full-contact collisions without protective gear,” he said. Media reports inside New Zealand linked the game to the Run It Straight challenge. The challenge has been gaining traction on social media over recent weeks, with videos on TikTok and Instagram of mostly men running at full-speed into one another clocking up tens of millions of views. “While this was an impromptu game among friends, not a planned event, this tragic outcome does highlight the inherent safety concerns with such an activity,” Grantham said. The tragedy follows a championship Run It Straight event hosted in Auckland last week, which resulted in two men retiring due to head injuries. One of the menappeared to have a seizure, RNZ reported. The event’s organisers, RUNIT promotes the sport on its website as “the world’s fiercest new collision sport” which rewards “strength and grit”. More than 1000 people turned up to watch eight men compete for $20,000 prize money, with the winners heading to a final competition next month, to compete for $250,000. In a statement to the Guardian, RUNIT said the teenager’s death was tragic. “Any contact sport like boxing, martial arts or combat-style activities should only be held in highly controlled environments, which include professional medical supervision and support,” it said. It said its events screen participants, have strict guidelines around how and where to tackle, conduct medical assessments before and after the competition and have medical staff on hand. “We do not encourage any copying of the sport as it should only be done under the strict conditions”. Melanie Bussey, a professor in the school of Physical Education, Sport and Exercise Sciences at University of Otago said Run It-style tackles can increase the likelihood of serious brain trauma. Sports associations and governing bodies were working hard to improve the welfare of players and reduce preventable injuries, and the introduction of a high-risk sport seem “not only counterproductive but deeply concerning”, she said. Patria Hume, a Human Performance professor at AUT warned the public about the risk of injury and death from playing the sport.“[The] death was preventable,” she said. “We need people to stop participating in activities where the intention is to hurt someone.”",

    "title": "France spent €90,000 countering research into impact of Pacific nuclear tests",
    "article_text": "France’s Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) has spent tens of thousands of euros in an effort to counter research revealing that Paris hasconsistently underestimated the devastating impactof its nuclear tests in French Polynesia in the 1960s and 1970s. Days before a parliamentary inquiry presents its report on the tests, documents obtained by the investigative outlet Disclose, and seen by Le Monde and the Guardian, suggest the CEA ran a concerted campaign to discredit the revelations. A 2021 book,Toxique, which focused on just six of the 193 nuclear tests that France carried out from 1966 to 1996 at Moruroa and Fangataufa atolls, drawing on 2,000 pages of declassified material and dozens of interviews, concluded that they contaminated many more people than France has ever acknowledged. The latest documents show that a year after the book’s publication, the CEA published 5,000 copies of its own booklet – titled “Nuclear tests in French Polynesia: why, how and with what consequences?” – and distributed them across the islands. As part of an operation costing more than €90,000, the commission also flew a four-man team by business class to French Polynesia, where they stayed at the Hilton hotel, to meet local dignitaries and give interviews to the media. The CEA’s booklet, printed on glossy paper, claimed to provide “scientific responses” to the “allegations” contained in Toxique, whose authors it said did not have “the same level of expertise”. It claimed contamination had been limited and thatFrancealways behaved transparently and with respect for local inhabitants’ health. The publication of Toxique – based on the investigation by Disclose, Princeton University’s science and global security programme and Interprt, an environmental justice research collective – caused a furore in France, prompting visits to French Polynesia by a minister and the president, Emmanuel Macron, who acknowledged France’s “debt” to the region. In one 1974 test alone, thescientific researchfound, 110,000 people – the population of Tahiti and its nearby islands – could have received a radiation dose high enough to qualify them for compensation if they later developed one of 23 different cancers. Toxique alleged the CEA has long underestimated the radiation levels involved, significantly limiting the numbers eligible for compensation: by 2023, fewer than half the 2,846 compensation claims submitted had even been judged admissible. The parliamentary inquiry, which has so far called more than 40 politicians, military personnel, scientists and victims, is due to report before the end of May on the social, economic and environmental impact of the tests – and whether France knowingly concealed the extent of contamination. The CEA’s military division, CEA/DAM, the inventor of France’s atomic bomb, has repeatedly called this a “false assertion”. But France’s nuclear safety body, the ASNR, has since acknowledged “uncertainties associated with [the CEA’s] calculations” and confirmed to the parliamentary inquiry that it was impossible to prove people received radiation doses lower than the compensation threshold. The CEA said in a statement that the aim of its booklet “was to provide Polynesians in particular with the elements to understand” the tests and their impact. It said the booklet applied “the necessary scientific rigour” to explain “the health and environmental consequences of the tests” in a “factual and transparent manner”. Vincenzo Salvetti, a former head of the CEA/DAM and a member of the 2022 mission to French Polynesia, denied the booklet was intended as the CEA’s official version of events or a response to Toxique. He said previous CEA publications – particularly a 2006 report that the Toxique researchers calculate underestimated the actual radioactive contamination levels of one nuclear test by a factor of three – had been “much too technical”. Salvetti confirmed, however, that the booklet stated that the health of Polynesia’s inhabitants had been a “constant concern” of the French state and that France had behaved throughout “with a transparency without precedent or international equivalent”. Nonetheless, the inquiry has heard that the CEA/DAM has so far declassified only 380 documents in the four years since Macron demanded “greater transparency” around the tests and their consequences – compared with 173,000 declassified by the army. Jérôme Demoment, the director of CEA/DAM, told the parliamentary inquiry earlier this year that it was “highly likely, if we were to have to manage [nuclear tests] today, that the system put in place would respond to a different logic”. Forty-six of France’s nuclear tests were atmospheric, exposing the local population, site workers and French soldiers who were stationed in Polynesia at the time to high levels of radiation before the testing programme was moved underground in 1974. Radiation-related thyroid, breast and lung cancers, as well as leukaemia and lymphoma, are prevalent across the islands. For its part, the French army has said up to 2,000 military personnel could have been exposed to enough radiation to cause cancer. “The notion of a ‘clean bomb’ has generated controversy, which I fully understand,” Demoment told the parliamentary inquiry. “No nuclear test generating radioactive fallout can be considered clean.”",

    "title": "Zelenskyy bound for Berlin with Merz boxed in by German coalition",
    "article_text": "The German chancellor’s drive to keep a campaign pledge of more robust backing for Ukraine is running into blocks within his own government as he prepares to welcomeVolodymyr Zelenskyyto Berlin. Friedrich Merz made a full-throated declaration on Monday, hours before Zelenskyy’s one-day visit was announced, that Germany was for the first time lifting previous range restrictions on weapons supplied to Kyiv, along with Ukraine’s other main western supporters. His statement – in an interview with a public broadcaster, which his team later posted to social media – was widely interpreted as a pivot toward bolstering Berlin’s aid to Kyiv at a time of devastating aerial bombardment by Russia. It drew immediate condemnation from Moscow and invited speculation it could bea prelude to Germany announcing it was sending long-requested Taurus missiles to Ukraine, possibly as soon as at the Zelenskyy talks on Wednesday. However, on Tuesday, Merz, of the conservative Christian Democratic Union, appeared to finesse his message as he faced criticism from his coalition partners, the centre-left Social Democrats. Far from a groundbreaking new policy, Merz said, permission forUkraineto strike military targets inside Russian territory using weapons supplied by western allies had been granted previously after an extensive debate. “Hence yesterday in Berlin I was describing something that already happened months ago,” he said. Ukraine already fired British-made Storm Shadow missilesinto Russia last November, as well as French Scalps and USAtacms. Germany has delivered only two weapons systems to Ukraine that could be used to attack Russian positions beyond the border: Mars II rocket launchers and PzH 2000, a self-propelled howitzer. Range restrictions on both were lifted in May 2024. The Kremlin had said on Monday that any new decision to scrap range limits was “quite dangerous” and “contrary to our efforts to reach a political settlement”. Merz’s initial comments also drew criticism from leading Social Democrats. MP Ralf Stegner, an SPD foreign policy expert and frequent critic of arms shipments to Ukraine, called the remarks “not helpful” and “wrong” and demanded redoubled “diplomatic efforts”. Vice-chancellor Lars Klingbeil of the Social Democrats insisted there was “no new agreement that goes beyond what the previous government did” on range restrictions. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, used the confusion over Merz’s initial remarks to question the calibre of people who had risen to power in leading European countries, Reuters reported. Merz “said yesterday with such pretentiousness that from now on and forever there are no restrictions on the range of strikes” before placing the policy in context, Lavrov told reporters at a meeting in Moscow with the Turkish foreign minister, Hakan Fidan. Asked aboutDonald Trump’s commentthat Vladimir Putin had “gone absolutely crazy” with the latest offensive, Lavrov said that the US president was showing “emotion” as he was watching his efforts for peace in Ukraine sabotaged by European politicians. In what Ukraine called a weekend of “terror”,Russia battered Kyivover three nights with massive air attacks, fuelling calls from western partners for an immediate ceasefire. However, Merz said on Tuesday that a halt to the fighting appeared far out of reach, despite Russian and Ukrainian officials holding direct talks for the first time in three years earlier this month. “Wars typically end because of economic or military exhaustion on one side or on both sides, and in this war we are obviously still far from reaching that,” Merz said at a joint news conference with the Finnish prime minister, Petteri Orpo, in Turku. Sign up toThis is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion “So we may have to prepare for a longer duration.” Merz has already met Zelenskyy twice this month, in Kyiv and at a summit of European leaders in Albania. The talks in Berlin are aimed at discussing possible further direct discussions between Ukrainian and Russian officials, and to inform Zelenskyy about a new planned EU sanctions package against Russia, Der Spiegel and Süddeutsche Zeitung reported. Before taking office three weeks ago, Merz had hammered his Social Democrat predecessor, Olaf Scholz, as being far too timid in his defence of Ukraine against the Russian onslaught. Scholz’s three-way coalition strongly backed Kyiv but stopped short of sending it long-range Taurus missiles, citing concerns it could heighten tensions with nuclear-armed Moscow. Merz’s new government has stressed Germany, the second biggest national supplier of weapons to Ukraine after the US, would no longer publicly detail what arms it was sending to Ukraine, opting for a stance of “strategic ambiguity”. The secrecy, however, is unlikely to paper over differences between the ruling parties over military aid. Despite Merz’s repeated calls as opposition leader and during the campaign ahead of February’s general election to send Ukraine Taurus missiles, which have a range of 500 km, SPD leaders have made clear that they would, at least for now, veto such a move. Moscow, which has repeatedly rejected proposals from Kyiv and its western allies for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire and fired hundreds of drones at Ukraine between late Friday and early Monday, killing more than a dozen people. The Kremlin insisted on Monday that Putin was simply taking measures “necessary to ensure Russia’s security”. Merz is expected to travel to Washington next month for his first meeting as chancellor with Trump, who has positioned himself as a go-between to broker an end to Moscow’s three-year offensive. European leaders are working to win steadfast support from the US presidentfor sanctions against Russia after conflicting messages.",

    "title": "Trump warns Putin he is ‘playing with fire’ after Russian attack on Ukraine",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump has warnedVladimir Putinthat he is “playing with fire”, launching a fresh broadside at his Russian counterpart over stalled Ukraine peace efforts. Trump’s latest comments came after he called the Kremlin leader “CRAZY”over the weekendfollowing a mass Russian air attack on Kyiv, and warned that Moscow risked new sanctions. “What Vladimir Putin doesn’t realize is that if it weren’t for me, lots of really bad things would have already happened toRussia, and I mean REALLY BAD,” Trump said on his Truth Social network on Tuesday. “He’s playing with fire!” Trump did not specify what the “really bad” things were, or make any specific threats. But the Wall Street Journal and CNN reported that Trump was now considering fresh sanctions against Russia as early as this week, while stressing that he could still change his mind. Trump had told reporters on Sunday he was “absolutely” considering increasing sanctions on Moscow. The White House said Trump was keeping “all options” open. “This war is Joe Biden’s fault, and President Trump has been clear he wants to see a negotiated peace deal. President Trump has also smartly kept all options on the table,” the White House’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told AFP in a statement. Biden imposed sweeping sanctions after Russia’s invasion. Trump has so far avoided what he says could be “devastating” sanctions on Russian banks. But Trump’s recent rebukes mark a major change from his previous attitude towards Putin, whom he often speaks of with admiration and has previouslyheld off criticizing. Trump has, however, expressed increasing frustration with Moscow’s position in deadlocked truce negotiations with Kyiv. That frustration boiled over at the weekend when Russia launched a record drone barrage atUkraine, killing at least 13 people. Sign up toHeadlines US Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion “I’ve always had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia, but something has happened to him. He has gone absolutely CRAZY!” Trump said in a Truth Social post on Sunday night. Russia’s attacks have continued despite a phone call between Trump and Putin eight days ago in which the US leader said the Russian president had agreed to “immediately” start ceasefire talks. Moscow on Tuesday accused Kyiv of trying to “disrupt” peace efforts and said its aerial assaults on Ukraine in recent days were a “response” to escalating Ukrainian drone strikes on its own civilians. US lawmakers have stepped up calls for Trump to slap sanctions on Russia.The veteran Republican senator Chuck Grassley called for strong measures to let Putin to know it was “game over”. Two other senators, Republican Lindsey Graham and Democrat Richard Blumenthal, also called for heavy “secondary” sanctions on countries that buy Russian oil, gas and raw materials.",

    "title": "France’s National Assembly votes in favour of legalising assisted dying",
    "article_text": "France’s parliament has voted in favour of a bill to legalise assisted dying, paving the way for caregivers to help patients end their lives under what campaigners say would still be some of the strictest conditions inEurope. After a sometimes emotional session, deputies passed the first reading of the bill by a vote of 305 to 199. They also unanimously backed a less contentious law establishing a right to palliative care in specialist end-of-life institutions. Both votes are the start of a long parliamentary process that will require the bills to move on to the Senate – the upper house – and then back to the lower house – the National Assembly – for a second reading, meaning they are unlikely to become law before next year. The government has describedthe right-to-die lawas “an ethical response to the need to support the sick and the suffering”, insisting it was “neither a new right nor a freedom … but a balance between respect and personal autonomy”. The legislation would allow a medical team to decide if a patient is eligible to “gain access to a lethal substance when they have expressed the wish”. Patients would be able to use it themselves or have it administered by a nurse or doctor “if they are in no condition physically to do so themselves”. Patients must meet a number of strict conditions: they must be over 18, hold French citizenship or residency and suffer from a “serious and incurable, life-threatening, advanced or terminal illness” that is “irreversible”. The disease must cause “constant, unbearable physical or psychological suffering” that cannot be addressed by medical treatment, and the patient must be capable of “expressing freely and in an informed manner” their wish to end their life. The bill – referred to in France as a law on “end of life” or “aid in dying” rather than “assisted dying” or “euthanasia” – was backed by most of Emmanuel Macron’s centrist MPs and their allies and by the left, with most right and far-right deputies voting against. All parliamentary groups were given a free vote to express their personal convictions. Euthanasia is a highly sensitive subject inFrance, a country with a longstanding Catholic tradition, and the bill is also opposed by many health workers. “The French people are ready for this, and we owe them this rendezvous with history,” said Stéphane Delautrette, a Socialist party MP during the session. The laws would be “the measure of this parliament, in the footsteps of major social advances” such as the right to abortion and the abolition of the death penalty, he said. But Patrick Hetzel, a deputy from the centre-right Les Républicains, said it was “illusory to and even dangerous to even think of debating a legalisation of euthanasia without having first fully deployed proper access to palliative care.” The prime minister, François Bayrou, a devout Catholic, had said he had “questions” and would abstain if he were an MP, but Macron said last year that France needed the legislation because “there are situations you cannot humanely accept”. Sign up toHeadlines Europe A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day after newsletter promotion France currently allows passive euthanasia – such as withholding artificial life support – and deep sedation before death, but patients seeking active end-of-life options have no choice but to travel to other countries where euthanasia is legal. Right-to-die campaigners have welcomed the law, though describing it as relatively modest in scope. “It’s a foot in the door, which will be important for what comes next,” said Stéphane Gemmani of the ADMD association. “We’ve been waiting for this for decades. Hopefully France will steadily align itself with other European countries,” Gemmani said. “Forcing people to go to Belgium or Switzerland, pay €10,000 or €15,000 … The current situation is just wrong.” Opinion polls show most French people are in favour of assisted dying, but France has been slower than many European neighbours to legalise it. Others are actively debating the issue, including the UK, where an assisted dying billis before parliament. Active euthanasia, where a caregiver induces death at the request of the patient, and assisted suicide, where doctors provide the patient with the means to end their life themselves, have been legal in the Netherlands and Belgium since 2002. Both countries apply roughly similar conditions – a doctor and an independent expert must agree the patient is suffering unbearably and without hope of improvement – and have since extended the right to children under 12. Luxembourg also decriminalised active euthanasia and assisted dying in 2009. Active euthanasia is outlawed in Switzerland, but assisted dying has been legal since the 1940s and organisations such as Exit and Dignitas have helped thousands of Swiss nationals, residents and others to end their lives. Austria legalised assisted dying in 2022, while Spain adopted a law in 2021 allowing euthanasia and medically assisted dying for people with a serious and incurable illness, providing they are capable and conscious, the request was made in writing, reconfirmed later, and approved by an evaluation committee. Portugal decriminalised euthanasia in 2023 but the measure has not yet come into force after certain articles were rejected by the constitutional court. In the UK, MPsapproved the legalisationof assisted dying in England and Wales for adults with an incurable illness who have a life expectancy of under six months and are able to take the substance that causes their death themselves, in a first vote in November last year. MPs must now vote on whether the text, amended in May to allow medics to opt out, is sent to the upper chamber for further scrutiny. The Scottish parliament has alsopassed its first voteon a bill to legalise assisted dying.",

    "article_text": "Sales of new Tesla electric cars are sliding across Europe, data suggests, amid apolitical backlashagainst its billionaire chief executive, Elon Musk. The figures from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) showed registrations for new Teslas halved in April compared to the same month a year earlier, despite a broader rise in battery electric vehicles overall. The electric carmaker faces widespread backlash against Musk’s political ties to Donald Trump, and vocal support for the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party. Russ Mould, of the investment broker AJ Bell, said the drop in registrations “suggests the brand damage caused by Elon Musk’s political interventions may be lasting. “The company may also be suffering from its lack of tyre print in the hybrid market with many motorists still wary of going fully electric,” he said. According to the latest snapshot, the ACEA saidTeslaregistrations fell from 14,228 in April 2024 to 7,261 last month, a decline of 49%, in the EU, the UK, and the broader European Free Trade Association bloc – which consists of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland. However, overall battery electric car sales rose by 27.8% in April, compared with a 22.4% drop in petrol cars and a 24.7% drop in diesel cars. Sales of plug-in hybrid cars rose by 31.3%. Total car registrations rose most for the Chinese state-owned manufacturer SAIC, owner of the British brand MG, and the Japanese carmaker Mitsubishi. This year sales at Tesla have fallen in some of its biggest markets and there have beenpolitical protests at some of its showrooms. In the UK, the company registered just 512 new vehicles in April, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, down 62% from a year earlier. Speaking at the Qatar Economic Forum last week, Musk told Bloomberg that while Europe was Tesla’s weakest market, it was “strong everywhere else”, and although it had “lost some sales paths on the [political] left”, it had “gained them on the right”. Tesla reported a 13% drop in vehicle sales in the first three months of this year, which made itthe worst quarter since 2022. However, shares in Tesla have rallied by about 25% in the past month, after reports that Musk will bereducing his time spent advising the Trump administration.

    "article_text": "The EU executive has launched an investigation into four pornographic websites over alleged failure to prevent children from seeing adult content. After analysis of company policies, theEuropean Commissionaccused Pornhub, Stripchat, XNXX and XVideos of failing to have effective age verification measures to stop minors accessing their content. The investigation was opened under the EU’sDigital Services Act(DSA), a wide-ranging law to combat online harms, including disinformation, cyber-attacks, hate speech and the sale of fake goods. The act also includes tough provisions to protect children online, including preventing damage to mental health caused by seeing adult content. According to the commission, all four platforms had one-click self-declarations to verify age, which it deemed ineffective to prevent under-18s from viewing adult content. “Today is a good day for minor protection online in the EU, because with the enforcement actions that we are launching … against four very large online platforms with pornographic, adult content, we are clearly showing that we mean it when it comes to the effective protection of minors under the DSA,” an EU official told reporters. There was no fixed timetable to complete the investigation, the official said, while stressing “a commitment to act relatively fast on potential next steps, depending on what the reaction of the platforms will be”. The platforms could resolve the investigation by producing forms of age verification deemed effective by EU regulators. But if the complaint is upheld they could be fined up to 6% of global annual turnover. Under the DSA, the commission regulates platforms with more than 45 million users, such as Google, Meta and X, while national authorities in the 27 member states are responsible for those below this threshold. The commission said on Tuesday that Stripchat was no longer designated a “very large online platform”, after an appeal by the company, meaning its activities would in future be regulated by Cyprus, where its parent company, Technius Ltd, is based, rather than Brussels. The investigation into age verification tools will continue, however, as the new designation does not apply until September. Stripchat’s child protection obligations remain the same. The parent company of Pornhub, Aylo Freesites, said it was aware of the commission’s investigation and “fully committed” to ensuring the safety of minors online. “We will always comply with the law,” the company said. “We believe that the real solution for protecting minors and adults alike is to verify users’ ages at the point of access – the users’ devices – and for websites to deny or permit access to age-restricted materials based on that verification.” Technius was approached for comment. A Brussels-based lawyer who has recently represented the parent companies of XVideos (WebGroup Czech Republic) and XNXX (NKL Associates) in EU legal proceedings was also contacted for comment.",

    "title": "Israeli troops open fire as aid group loses control of distribution centre",
    "article_text": "Israeli troops have opened fire near thousands of hungry Palestinians as a logistics group chosen byIsraelto ship food into Gaza lost control of its distribution centre on its second day of operations. An 11-week total siege and a continuing tight Israel blockade mean most people inGazaare desperately hungry. Hundreds of thousands walked through Israeli military lines to reach the new distribution centre in Rafah on Tuesday. But the newly established Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) was not prepared for them and staff at one point were forced to abandon their posts. “At one moment in the late afternoon, the volume of people at the SDS [secure distribution centre] was such that the GHF team fell back to allow a small number of Palestinians in Gaza to take aid safely and dissipate,” the foundation said in a statement. Israeli tank fire and gunfire was heard, and a military helicopter fired flares, the Associated Press reported. At least three injured Palestinians were taken from the scene, one of them bleeding from a leg wound. The Israeli military said it fired “warning shots” near the compound to restore control. It was not immediately clear if there had been any injuries among people trying to get food. In a speech on Tuesday night, Israel’s prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, acknowledged that there had been a “loss of control momentarily” during the food distribution, but added: “Happily, we brought it back under control.” Images shared on social media, which could not immediately be verified, appeared to show people waiting in queues between wire fences. These were later partly torn down as people rushed into an open field where boxes were waiting. Some reportedly managed to obtain aid boxes with basic items including sugar, flour, pasta and tahini but most left empty-handed. “There was no order, the people rushed to take, there was shooting, and we fled,” Hosni abu Amra, who had also been waiting for food, told AP. “We fled without taking anything that would help us get through this hunger.” Ahmed abu Taha, who said he heard gunfire and saw Israeli military aircraft overhead, said: “It was chaos. People were panicked.” On Sunday, Jake Wood, the founding director of the GHF, resigned, saying that it would not be possible for the group to deliver aid “while also strictly adhering to the humanitarian principles ofhumanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence”. The UN and other humanitarian organisations had already refused to work with the GHF on the grounds that doing so would compromise values that are key to reaching civilians in all conflict zones, and put at risk their teams and the recipients of aid in Gaza. They also warned that a newly formed group with no experience would not be able to handle the logistics of feeding more than 2 million people in a devastated combat zone. US state department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said the concerns were unfounded and the most important priority was getting aid into Gaza, no matter who was delivering it. She also blamed Hamas for trying to stop convoys organised by the GHF from getting to distribution centres.“They have attempted to stop the aid movement through Gaza to these distribution centres,” she said. “They have failed, but they certainly tried. The bottom line is the real story here is that the aid is moving through, and, in that kind of environment, it’s not surprising that there might be a few issues involved.” But the dangerous scenes on Tuesday appeared to confirm many of the fears raised by UN. Scenes of desperate crowds rushing to get aid were “heartbreaking”, the UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said, particularly when the UN and partners have a “detailed, principled, operationally sound plan” to get aid in. The trickle of food currently reaching Gaza was not enough to feed its people, he added. “We continue to stress that a meaningful scale-up of humanitarian operations is essential to stave off famine and meet the needs of all civilians, wherever they are.” Israel is trying to replace the humanitarian organisations that bring aid into Gaza. It has long claimed, without providing evidence, that Hamas disrupts supply networks to profit from aid. The GHF uses armed security contractors to deliver food in compounds guarded by Israel’s military. It previously acknowledged that this method excludes some of the most vulnerable people in Gaza because only those able to walk long distances and carry heavy boxes of food will be able to feed their families this way. And despite pushing for control of food and other supplies coming into Gaza, the Israel Defense Forces had not properly prepared to distribute aid and “planned to direct the population using gunfire,” a security source told Haaretz. “They treated it like a routine situation involving suspects entering a combat zone, but you can’t direct a population of that scale with gunfire if you want them to feel safe reaching the areas you’ve opened,” he told the newspaper. The source said the military’s original idea to direct crowds using gunfire suggests “they didn’t think and didn’t plan” to use other means, such as fencing off the area. The GHF said its decision to abandon the distribution centre “was done in accordance with GHF protocol to avoid casualties” and that by the end of Tuesday it had handed out 8,000 boxes of food: enough to feed 44,000 people for half a week according to its calculations. That is just 2% of Gaza’s population. The foundation said deliveries would be increased during the week. Pictures shared on social media that appeared to show the content of the boxes, but could not immediately be verified, suggested they would be meagre meals, mostly rice, pasta and flour with some cans of beans and vegetables sourced from Israel. The GHF has not revealed who is funding its work, although initial pictures showed boxes with the logos of three small aid organisations with experience working in Gaza. None responded to questions about their work with the GHF, but even if they have agreed to partner with the organisation long term, they do not have the capacity to meet overall needs. “Regardless of whether the GHF is operating or not, we know from decades of experience and the almost 600 days we have been responding to this catastrophe in Gaza that this shameful exercise in the militarisation of aid is not going to work,” said Bushra Khalidi, Oxfam’s policy lead in the occupied Palestinian territory. “Even in the most optimal of conditions, there is no logistical company who can feed 2.1 million people overnight. Humanitarianism is not just about handing out food parcels to feed starving people; it is about ensuring that people have the means to survive.” Israeli forces have taken control of much of Gaza since the end of a ceasefire in March, launching heavy attacks that have killed nearly 4,000 Palestinians, health authorities there say. The total death toll from Israeli attacks inside Gaza has now passed 54,000, most of them civilians. Israel launched the war after cross-border attacks by Hamas on 7 October 2023 killed about 1,200 people, the majority of them civilians, and saw 250 taken hostage.",

    "article_text": "Her life was one of war but Yaqeen Hammad somehow found a reason to smile. The 11-year-old was Gaza’s youngest influencer, whose bright smile reached tens of thousands, including other children, while she offered practical survival tips for daily life under bombardment, such as advice on how to cook with improvised methods when there was no gas. In one social media post, Yaqeen wrote: “I try to bring a bit of joy to the other children so that they can forget the war.” On Friday night, she was killed after a series of heavy Israeli airstrikes hit the house where she lived with her family, in Al-Baraka area of Deir al-Bala, in central Gaza. Her body, torn apart by the bombing, was recovered from beneath the rubble. When news of Yaqeen’s death spread online on Monday, there was an outpouring of messages of grief and tributes from activists, followers and journalists. “Instead of being at school and enjoying her childhood,” one of her followers wrote on X, “she was active on Instagram and participating in campaigns to help others in Gaza. No words. Absolutely no words.” Mahmoud Bassam, a photojournalist in Gaza, said: “Her body may be gone, but her impact remains a beacon of humanity.” Yaqeen and her older brother, Mohamed Hammad, delivered food, toys and clothing to displaced families, Al Jazeera has reported. She played an active role in the Ouena collective, a Gaza-based non-profit organisation dedicated to humanitarian relief. Yaqeen and Mohamed, a humanitarian worker, often visited camps and makeshift shelters for displaced families. In each place they went, she tried to spread cheer and comfort to the children. Hani Abu Rizq, a journalist and colleague of Yaqeen’s in the Ouena collective, described her work as “truly beautiful”. “She had an entrepreneurial spirit and was always the first to do good. She loved helping others and bringing joy to children in displacement camps. She had a special touch, spreading hope and optimism among people despite the difficult circumstances,” he said.

They conveyed the reality of Palestinian children in Gaza, who are suffering from all kinds of Israeli violations in this genocide that we have been subjected to for nearly two years.” In one of her final posts, she wrote: “Today was a day of joy for Gaza’s orphans – we were giving them new clothes to bring a little happiness.” She refused to give in to the war, dancing, smiling and handing out ice-creams and praying with other children. In a post on Instagram on 15 May, she told her 103,000 followers: “Despite the war and the genocide, we came today to make the children happy.” She wrote under the video: “Is there anything more beautiful than the smile of Gaza children.” On 29 April, Yaqeen gave her followers sometips on how to cook with improvised methods when there was no gas. “Did they cut off the gas? We made gas. We put wood here and a stove to let air in and make the fire burn more. We cook everything on it. Gaza: no to the impossible,” she wrote. On 15 March, holding a bouquet of flowers,Yaqeen stepped into the tent where her brother was livingand sang him Happy Birthday. “Despite the pain and shock of Yaqeen’s killing, this is the true face of the occupation,” Rizq said. “Israel has killed a very large number of children during this genocide.” The Palestinian photojournalist Amr Tabash wrote on Instagram, alongside a clip featuring glimpses of Yaqeen working on humanitarian projects: “Yaqeen was martyred, yet certainty remains in our hearts that the children of Gaza are the heartbeat of humanity and a reflection of global silence.” Mohamad al-Kadri, a volunteer with Muslim Doctors for Humanity, said: “She was a child who carried in her heart a love for doing good, a spirit of initiative, and dedicated her young energy to planting hope in the hearts of those around her.” The Israeli military has been contacted for comment. Israel has intensified its air campaign in Gaza in recent days. Its airstrikes killed at least 52 people on Monday, including 31 in a school turned shelter that was struck as people slept, igniting their belongings, according to local health officials. On Sunday, Israeli attackskilled at least 38 people, health officials said, bringing the death toll to more than 100 over the weekend. Yaqeen died during the same series of strikes across the territory thatkilled nine of a paediatrician’s 10 children, sparking international outrage. The Gaza health ministry says nearly 54,000 Palestinians, including 16,503 children, have been killed in Israeli attacks across the territory. On Thursday, health officials in the territory released a detailed breakdown of the numbers of children killed since Israel began its offensive in 2023 after the 7 October attacks by Hamas. According to their new data, 916 infants under one year old have been killed; 4,365 of those killed were between one and five years old; 6,101 were between six and 12 years old, and 5,124 were between 13 and 17.",

Olmert, who was the 12th prime minister of Israel from 2006 to 2009, wrote in an opinion piece for the Israeli newspaper and website Haaretz that “the government of Israel is currently waging a war without purpose, without goals or clear planning and with no chances of success”. He added: “Never since its establishment has the state of Israel waged such a war … The criminal gang headed byBenjamin Netanyahuhas set a precedent without equal in Israel’s history in this area, too. The former Israeli PM and former member of Likud, the same party as Netanyahu, wrote that the “pointless victims among the Palestinian population” were reaching “monstrous proportions” in recent weeks. “Recent operations inGazahave nothing to do with legitimate war goals,” he wrote. “This is now a private political war. Its immediate result is the transformation of Gaza into a humanitarian disaster area.” Olmert said he had often asserted that Israel was not committing war crimes in Gaza and claimed with conviction that “in no case did a government official give orders to hit Gazan civilians indiscriminately”. However, in recent weeks, “I’ve been no longer able to do so,” he said. “What we are doing in Gaza now is a war of devastation: indiscriminate, limitless, cruel and criminal killing of civilians. It’s the result of government policy – knowingly, evilly, maliciously, irresponsibly dictated.” “Yes, Israel is committing war crimes,” he concluded. In an interview with the BBC last week, Olmert described the continuing conflict as “a war without a purpose – a war without a chance of achieving anything that can save the lives of the hostages.” His comments to the British broadcaster caused a row in Israel. The far-right parties condemned his words, which followed the Democrats party head, Yair Golan, a former deputy chief of staff of the Israeli army, whotold the Kan national broadcasterthat “a sane country does not fight against civilians, does not kill babies as a hobby, and does not give itself the aim of expelling populations”. The Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, accused Olmert and Golan of “taking an active part in a diplomatic campaign, in a propaganda war and in legal warfare against the state of Israel and the IDF”. The education minister, Yoav Kisch, said that Olmert and Golan had joined a “radical leftist chorus defaming Israel in the international arena”. “While IDF troops are risking their lives against murderous terrorists seeking our annihilation, he decides to incite and stick a knife in their backs,” Kisch said. The social equality minister, May Golan, accused Olmert of “spitting in the face” of Israeli soldiers. “To be exact, there are innocents in Gaza – 58 of them,” she said, referring to the Israeli hostages held captive in the territory. Some Israeli media outlets have framed Olmert’s remarks as a response to far-right outrage over the resumption of aid into Gaza, and to the inflammatory rhetoric of several Israeli politicians. The far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said Israel is “destroying everything that’s left of the Gaza Strip” and that “the army is leaving no stone unturned”. He declared: “We are conquering, cleansing and remaining in Gaza untilHamasis destroyed.” Smotrich said the IDF was “finally” targeting Hamas’s civilian infrastructure. “We’re eliminating ministers, bureaucrats, money handlers – everyone who holds up Hamas’s civilian rule.” On 22 May, the Israeli politician Moshe Feiglin told TV Channel 14: “The enemy is not Hamas, nor is it the military wing of Hamas.” Feiglin is a former member of the Israeli parliament. “Every child in Gaza is the enemy. We need to occupy Gaza and settle it, and not a single Gazan child will be left there. There is no other victory.”",

    "title": "‘Surge in anger’ as grassroots Labor members urge Albanese to impose sanctions on Israel over Gaza blockade",
    "article_text": "Pressure is building within Labor’s grassroots membership for the government to impose sanctions onIsraelover its blockade of much-needed food and aid into Gaza, with a key internal pro-Palestine group reporting “a surge in anger and frustration” among members that Australia has not voiced stronger condemnations. Rank-and-file members in local ALP branches will debate a motion, drafted by the Labor Friends of Palestine group, calling on the Albanese government to sanction individuals and groups involved in forced displacement of Palestinians, targeting of hospitals and schools, and the killing ofaid workersandjournalists. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email “There is a deep frustration that Australia has failed to move beyond words and take effective action under international law to protect the Palestinian people and hold Israel accountable,” said Peter Moss of Labor Friends of Palestine. “We are seeing a surge in anger and frustration among Labor members and the broader community. Labor Friends of Palestine is signing up a stream of new members horrified by the genocide. There are many Labor voters and supporters who cannot accept Australia’s failure to act effectively under international law to stop the starvation.” The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, on Mondaylevelled his strongest criticism yet at Israelover its actions in Gaza, branding a weeks-long blockade of aid “an outrage” and calling the Israeli government’s “excuses” for stopping critical food and medical supplies “completely untenable”. He said he had last week told Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, of Australia’s deep concern. Labor MP and former cabinet minister Ed Husictold ABC radioon Tuesday Australia must “progress from talk to action”, including ramping up aid into Gaza, as well as call in Israel’s ambassador. He also praised the “strength” of Albanese’s comments. Husic said the government should be “actively considering” targeted sanctions against Israel, a step he said was “probably under consideration”, and join international efforts from allied countries to “exert maximum international pressure to stop this blockade”. Australialast week joined 22 other nations in condemning Israelover its decision to allow only limited aid into Gaza, adding voice to a joint statement also signed by the UK, Canada and New Zealand. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, alsocondemned recent “abhorrent and outrageous” commentsmade by Netanyahu government members and said the Israeli government “cannot allow the suffering” in Gaza to continue. But Australia had not foreshadowed further targeted sanctions, as the UK, France and Canada didin a joint statement threatening to step up “concrete actions”. At an event at Parliament House on Tuesday night withBritish Australian doctor Mohammed Mustafawho has recently returned from a medical mission in Gaza, independent senator David Pocock urged the government to do more. “If the horror unfolding inGazais not our country’s red line for stronger action, then I don’t know what is,” Pocock told the event. Mustafa also called for more action. “You don’t have to be a major player to feed children. You don’t have to be a major player to heal children,” Mustafa said, referencing quotes from government ministers that Australia was “not a major player” in the Middle East. “We need healers in the Middle East, and Australia can be the healer. It can lead the world,” he told the event. Alex Ryvchin, CEO of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, was critical of Husic’s comments, calling for more attention to the release of Israeli hostages taken by Hamas. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion “It is easy to talk about sanctioning Israel and hauling in the ambassador, even though Prime Minister Albanese confirmed he already raised the issue with Israel’s President Herzog … Mr Husic should join us in calling for the immediate and unconditional surrender of Hamas to bring permanent relief to the people of Gaza,” he said. Australia will attend a UN conference in mid-June on the recognition of Palestinian statehood. It is understood the government is awaiting further information before settling on whether Wong or another representative attends. The government would not speculate on further sanctions. But government sources noted Albanese’s conversation with Herzog, and Wong’s meeting with Israeli foreign minister Gideon Saar, where concerns were raised. Moss welcomed Albanese’s statement on Monday, but also called for more tangible responses, including supporting a humanitarian aid convoy into Gaza. “At a minimum, Australia should immediately support the statement from the United Kingdom, France and Canada and prepare sanctions targeted at Israeli officials responsible for using starvation as a weapon of war,” he said. A motion to be debated at numerous Labor branches, drafted by Labor Friends of Palestine, notes the government’s endorsement of joint statements but says members are “disappointed” the government did not join France, Canada and the UK in proposing stronger action. The motion, which has not yet been passed by any branches, also calls for Labor to “redouble” efforts to bring about a ceasefire.",

    "title": "‘Remote purchase’ fraud in UK surges as customers tricked into disclosing passcodes",
    "article_text": "Banks are reporting a surge in a type of fraud where customers are tricked into disclosing online login passcodes they are sent, which has helped to fuel a 22% jump in crimes where scammers go shopping using people’s stolen details. The banking body UK Finance revealed that “remote purchase” fraud hit its highest-ever level in 2024, with almost 2.6m cases logged, which works out at more than 7,000 incidents a day, or almost five a minute. Urging the government to treat fraud as a “national security threat”, UK Finance said the rise in cases suggested that criminals were changing their tactics, amid evidence that another scam – where people are tricked into sending money to fraudsters – was in decline aftertougher rules were introducedlast autumn. Overall last year, criminals stole about £1.2bn through the various types of financial fraud. This figure was broadly the same as the previous year, but the number of confirmed cases rose by 12% to reach just over 3.3m. The vast majority of these cases involved remote purchase fraud, where criminals use stolen card details to buy items online. Incidents of this type of crime had been falling in recent years, but last year the total amount lost to this scam rose for the first time since 2018. Banks say they are increasingly seeing criminals use sophisticated techniques to get people to disclose one-time passcodes they are sent. These codes usually take the form of a unique set of numbers, a bit like a pin number, and banks typically send them to customers via text message when they use their card to make purchases online, log on to internet banking, or change their personal details. Once in possession of a passcode, a criminal can often use it to authenticate fraudulent online card transactions. These frauds often begin with the familiar methods criminals have developed to encourage people to share their bank details, including sending text messages with a promise of a payment, links to false websites, or offers on social media for cheap products. One variation of the scam involves fraudsters using the details they have obtained totransfer the bank cards of victimsto the digital wallets of their own phones and then buy goods online and in high street shops. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion In its report, UK Finance said its discussions with the industry “point to an increase in the compromise of one-time passcodes”. It warned: “This perhaps points to an over-confidence in one-time passcodes and the protection they offer customers, which is now being exploited to a growing degree by criminals.” Data hacks at third parties, such as retailers, were another “major driver” of remote purchase fraud, with criminals using stolen card details to make purchases online, said the banking body. It added: “The data stolen from a breach can be used for months or even years after the incident. Criminals also use the publicity around data breaches as an opportunity to trick people into revealing financial information.” The warning comes after Marks & Spencer was hit by a cyber-attack, though the retailer said this month that the customer data accesseddid not include usable payment or card details. Victims of unauthorised fraud – which includes remote purchase scams – are legally protected against losses, and UK Finance said its research indicated that customers were fully refunded in more than 98% of cases.",

    "article_text": "Arne Slot pulled out of the League Managers Association’s annual awards dinner in London on Tuesday after theappalling incidentat the end of Liverpool’s Premier League victory parade. The Liverpool head coach was due to receive the LMA’s and the Premier League’s manager of the year awards at the event for winning the title in his first season in English football. However, in light of the incident in Liverpool city centre on Monday, when 65 people were injured when acar drove into a crowdon Water Street, Slot and a senior delegation of Liverpool officials decided they should not attend. Liverpool cancelled all internal events after the incident and Slot felt it would be inappropriate to celebrate his achievements at the dinner. He sent a letter of apology to the LMA and event organisers in which he expressed his sadness at the horrific scenes that followed Liverpool’s trophy parade through the city. Slot wrote: “As you will know, a shocking incident took place in Liverpool yesterday, one that left dozens of men, women and children who had attended our parade injured and as a result I have had to withdraw from the event out of solidarity with all affected. This is not a decision I have taken lightly but it is one that I feel is absolutely right given the seriousness of the situation. I hope that I have your understanding in this regard. “I would like to take this opportunity to thank the wider football community, including the LMA itself, the Premier League and many clubs who will be represented tonight, for the support we have received over the last 24 hours. Football is and always should be a game built on rivalry, but it is also a great source of comradeship, especially at times like this. “If you would indulge me, I would also like to pay tribute to the emergency services and other authorities in Liverpool who swung into action as soon as the incident happened. Along with the supporters and bystanders who helped one another in an hour of need, I think everyone involved in the aftermath deserves the gratitude of all of us.” The Liverpool head coach said he was “humbled” to be named Premier League manager of the season and honoured to be awarded the Sir Alex Ferguson Trophy for the LMA Manager of the Year, particularly as the latter was voted for by his managerial peers. Slot said: “Sir Alex, I look forward to meeting with you at a later date to receive my trophy from you. I also look forward to attending my first LMA Annual Awards dinner on a future occasion. Thank you once again for your understanding and support. Enjoy your evening and if you could join me in keeping those affected by yesterday’s events in your thoughts and prayers it would be very much appreciated.”",

    "title": "AI tool trial could save equivalent of 1.5m meals in food waste",
    "article_text": "Millions of meals worth of wasted food could be redistributed thanks to an artificial intelligence tool being trialled by companies across the UK, includingNestlé. The AI tool, which has already generated an 87% reduction in edible food waste at one of the Swiss conglomerate’s factories over its first two-week trial period, is intended to “design out” food waste by providing real-time monitoring, tracking and insights of wasted ingredients and products. Under the pilot scheme, Nestlé said that up to 700 tonnes of qualitysurplus food– the equivalent of up to 1.5 million meals – could be saved. The trial is also estimated to prevent up to 1,400 tonnes of CO2 being emitted, helping to save up to £14m in running costs. Alina Sartogo, one of the co-founders of Zest, which developed the tool, said all the food waste it identified was edible, but not sellable at a profit for the manufacturers. For example, the waste might include a broken KitKat bar, or a product with an expiry date that’s too short to sell on to retailers. The Zest software could be expanded across the food supply chain on a subscription basis by March next year, following a series of pilots with different manufacturers. A second pilot with Nestlé has recently been launched after receiving funding from the government agency Innovate UK’sBridgeAIscheme, which provides a £1.9m match-funded grant for AI projects. Esra Kasapoglu, director of AI and data economy at the agency, said the project represented a“solution that aims to transform food sourcing and distribution across the UK, cutting waste, reducing carbon emissions, and lowering costs”. About4.6m tonnesof edible food, equivalent to 10bn meals of food, is wasted in the UK each year. Simon Millard, director of food at the charity FareShare, said the technology would“make a huge difference” to its work to redistribute food to more than 8,000 charities and community groups across the UK.

    "title": "Reeves in standoff with ministers over proposed cuts to public services",
    "article_text": "The Treasury is in a standoff with some ministers over proposed cuts to public services including policing and social housing, as the International Monetary Fund suggested the chancellor,Rachel Reeves, could give herself more flexibility to hit her fiscal rules. Senior police figures have raised concerns about the upcoming spending review with ministers, the Guardian understands. Chief officers from some of England and Wales’ biggest forces argue they cannot take further budget cuts. Several key departments are yet to agree their budgets with the Treasury, including the Home Office, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. The IMFsuggested on Thursday that Reeves could refine her fiscal framework, potentially giving the chancellor some political cover to ease her spending cuts in response to changes in growth forecasts. It said the current system, inherited from the previous Conservative government, of twice-yearly assessments of the public finances by theOffice for Budget Responsibility(OBR) was ripe for an overhaul. It said the chancellor should examine ways to avoid having to make short-term savings when there is a downturn in economic forecasts. But government sources said there were definitively no plans to change the government’s “ironclad” fiscal rules, pointing to the already high borrowing figures. One source said there were clear costs to any further changes to the rules, shown by the market’s reaction to changes to the borrowing rules at the last budget. Reeves has tweaked the rules already to allow more borrowing for capital investment –expected to equal £113bn. “When people say: why don’t you just change fiscal rules? Well, we did. We did make a choice to change fiscal rules, and that’s £113bn that wasn’t there,” the source said. There were currently “no plans” to change the number of forecasts by the OBR, though the prime minister is said to favour making the change. Starmer is one of several key figures in No 10 who would like to see forecasts reduced to once a year, as the IMF recommended – which would allow Reeves to meet her commitment of just one fiscal event a year. The OBR’s downgrading of growth forecasts, which wiped out Reeves’s headroom in the spring, meant the chancellor had tomake several cutsat the spring statement, including on welfare. Health and defence are expected to be the major winners when the spending review is published on 11 June, though there will be significant funding for energy infrastructure, including nuclear. Home Office sources say real-terms cuts to the department’s budget will make it nearly impossible to meet key pledges on increasing neighbourhood policing and halving violence against women and girls. The Home Office has been told that the Metropolitan police, the UK’s biggest police force, is already facing a £260m shortfall and having to cut 1,700 officers, community support officers and support staff. “Police forces are facing budget cuts already. To add to this will mean halting any progress made on some of the government’s key policies, including halving knife crime and halving violence against women and girls,” a police source said. “There has been some good progress on [violence against women and girls]. But, realistically, more deep cuts would put that progress in jeopardy.” Concern has been compounded by plans by the Ministry of Justice toshorten the sentences of violent offendersin an effort to free up prison places, though there will be more cash for probation services. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion There are also clashes between the Reeves and the housing secretary, Angela Rayner, over funding for social housing. Reeves has previously said housing will be one of the key beneficiaries of the £113bn in capital spending, which the government will begin to set out at the spending review, but did not specify social homes. The Treasury hasput £2bn into affordable housingto bridge the gap between a new programme set to be announced at the spending review and the current affordable homes spending, which is due to expire in 2026. At the time the funding was announced, the £2bn was described as a “downpayment” on further funding to be announced at the spending review, which Reeves said would mark a generational shift in the building of council homes. However, Rayner is understood to be dissatisfied with the level of funding for the next phase of the programme. The energy secretary, Ed Miliband, is also understood to be still fighting to keep cash for a major programme of insulation, which was a key part of the government’s net zero strategy, though his department is expected to get significant capital investment in energy infrastructure including nuclear. Labour had previously doubled the previous government’s warm homes scheme from £6bn to £13.2bn over this parliament. But sources say this is likely to be cut in the spending review. At the October budget, Reeves announced £3.4bn over three years for household energy efficiency schemes, heat decarbonisation and fuel poverty schemes. The government responded to concerns expressed at the time calling the sum the “bare minimum” and promising a spending uplift at the review that now looks to have been cancelled. Charities have warned this will make it much harder to hit the UK’s climate targets. Lily-Rose Ellis, a campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said:“Cutting policies like home insulation, which provide solutions to lower people’s bills for good, would be an absolutely terrible decision.”",

    "article_text": "The remains of a freelance writer inLas Vegaswere found last week inside a container at a downtown business, authorities said. Las Vegas police said in a news release that they discovered the body of Matthew Kelemen, 56, while responding to a report “of a foul-smelling odor” coming from the container. Kelemen’s cause and manner of death were still under investigation, the coroner’s office in Las Vegas said. Police said they identified Kelemen’s 63-year-old roommate as the suspect in his death. But the suspect died last week after crashing during a high-speed car chase involving the Utah highway patrol, police said. The car chase was unrelated to the investigation into Kelemen’s death, police said, but the department did not give further details. It also has not identified the type of business where Kelemen’s body was found or a possible motive. Kelemen’s sister, Mikki Zaferatos, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that her brother had been planning to move out of the room he was renting in a house also occupied by the suspect. Zaferatos said her brother “was really uneasy living there” and that he had described his roommate as “strange”. For two decades, Kelemen contributed film reviews, profiles, feature stories and more to local publications, including Las Vegas Weekly. A short story he wrote about Donny Osmond’s Strip residency published over the weekend in Las Vegas Magazine. Kelemen moved to Las Vegas in 2003 and had been a staff writer for several years at the now-defunct 944 and City Life magazines, the Review-Journal reported.",

    "article_text": "Two of the 10 prisoners whoescapedfromNew Orleans’sjail on 16 May remained on the run as of Tuesday, after three more of the group were rearrested on Monday, authorities said. One of the men was arrested by local police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, about 80 miles north-west ofNew Orleans. Two others were arrested in Walker county, Texas, Louisiana state police said on the Twitter/X. Louisiana authorities named the latest inmates who were recaptured as Lenton Vanburen, Leo Tate and Jermaine Donald. Jail escapees Dkenan Dennis, Corey Boyd, Gary C Price, Kendell Myles and Robert Moody were previously taken into custody by authorities. Antoine Massey and Derrick Groves remained at large Tuesday. At least 11 people have been arrested on allegations of helping the group of 10 inmates either before or after the breakout. Authorities had been scouring the New Orleans area for the escapees after they audaciouslybroke outof the Orleans Justice Center (OJC). The men yanked open a faulty cell door inside the jail, squeezed through a hole behind a toilet, scaled a barbed-wire fence and fled into the coverage of darkness – all while the lone staffer supervising them had temporary left to get food. The inmates’ absence wasn’t discovered until a headcount hours later, after they bolted for freedom. Graffiti left on the wall included the message “To Easy LoL” with an arrow pointing to the gap. City and state officials have pointed to multiple security lapses in the jail. Among those arrested on allegations of aiding the escapees was a jail maintenance worker accused of turning off the water to the toilet, an act authorities said helped the men get out. The worker said one of those incarcerated at the jail had threatened to stab him if he refused. Many of the men were originally in the OJC awaiting sentences or trials for alleged violent crimes including murder. Groves’s escape in particular has drawn attention. He has been convicted of a double murder and has pleaded guilty to two other killings. In an unrelated case that occurred about three years before he was born, Groves’s grandmother, Kim Groves, was slain after filing a brutality complaint against a New Orleans police officer – before the cop then hired a hitman to shoot her to death in 1994 in what was one of the city’s most notorious murders. Conditions had been deteriorating in New Orleans’s jail in the months before the escape, with unsupervised prisoners smoking marijuana “without fear of consequences” and fashioning weapons out of brooms, mops and buckets, according to a new report released on Tuesday by an independent watchdog monitoring a 2013 agreement with the federal government that was intended to reform the lockup. The monitor urged the official in charge of the jail – New Orleans sheriff Susan Hutson – to re-establish a high-security unit in the jail, noting the unrelenting violence among prisoners that’s made the facility “not reasonably safe and secure”. Hutson, a progressive reformer, had abandoned the practice of housing certain inmates in a high-security setting after taking office in 2022. “Many of the inmate-on-inmate assaults occur because staff allow inmates out of their cells and leave them unsupervised, or inmates are able to manipulate the locks on their cells to open them,” the monitors wrote in the report, which was written before the 10-man escape. The New Orleans jailbreak wasn’t the only one to make national news headlines recently. On Sunday, Grant Hardin – a former Gateway, Arkansas, police chief who is serving decades-long sentences for murder and rape – escaped from prison after disguising himself in “a makeshift outfit designed to mimic law enforcement”, authoritiessaid. Officials’ search for Hardin was entering its third day on Tuesday. The Associated Press contributed reporting",

A jury in 2022 found them guilty of conspiring to defraud community banks out of more than $30m in fraudulent loans. The Chrisleys were also found guilty of tax evasion. In a social media post on Tuesday, the White House said the US president called the Chrisley family and said “he will be granting full pardons”, adding: “Trump Knows Best!” The Chrisleys were found guilty of tax evasion by hiding their earnings while showcasing an extravagant lifestyle that prosecutors said included luxury cars, designer clothes, real estate and travel. Prosecutors said Todd Chrisley filed for bankruptcy, walking away from more than $20m in unpaid loans. Julie Chrisley was sentenced to seven years in federal prison, and Todd Chrisley got 12 years behind bars. The couple was also ordered to pay $17.8m in restitution. A three-judge panel of the 11th US circuit court of appeals last summer upheld the Chrisleys’ convictions but found a legal error in how the trial judge had calculated Julie Chrisley’s sentence by holding her accountable for the entire bank fraud scheme.

    "title": "Argentinian judge withdraws from a negligence trial about Maradona’s death",
    "article_text": "One of the three judges presiding over anegligence trialrelated to the death of Argentinian football player Diego Maradona has resigned, leaving the case’s future uncertain. On Tuesday, Judge Julieta Makintach announced she would recuse herself after reports emerged that she had participated in a documentary about Maradona’s death and its aftermath. “This is a judicial tragedy,” said Fernando Burlando, a lawyer for Maradona’s eldest daughters, Dalma and Gianinna. Judges are largely forbidden from taking part in interviews and other public commentary while proceedings are ongoing. Since March 11, Makintach has been part of a three-judge panel weighing the fate of seven healthcare workers whotended to Maradonaduring his final days. The seven have been charged with negligent homicide following Maradona’s death by cardiac arrest in 2020 at age 60. It is a high-profile case that has stirred a great deal of scrutiny in Argentina. Maradona is a national hero, having led the national football squad to a World Cup victory in 1986. His performance in that year’s World Cup tournament has since become the stuff of sporting legend. Even a foul he committed during the quarterfinal has been dubbed the “Hand of God”, since it led to an Argentinian victory over England – a rival with whom the country had an ongoing territorial dispute. In 2000, the football governing body, FIFA, named Maradona one of its two “Players of the Century”, alongside Brazil’s Pele. But Maradona struggled with addiction, and he passed away shortly after undergoing brain surgery for a blood clot. The circumstances of his death, in turn, led to questions about whether the football player received adequate medical care in his final days. The seven defendants include a neurosurgeon, a psychiatrist, nurses and other healthcare professionals who attended to him. They face up to 25 years in prison if convicted. Aneighth personis expected to face court separately. More than 190 witnesses are expected to testify against the seven main defendants. One coroner alreadytold the courtin March that Maradona’s death “was foreseeable” and that the football player likely died in “agony”. But the trial was brought to a halt last week when one of the key defendants, Leopoldo Luque, called for Judge Makintach to be removed from the bench. Luque was a neurosurgeon and a personal doctor to Maradona when he died. Luque’s lawyer, Julio Rivas, told the court that his client had been approached by the BBC, a British news company, to take part in the documentary. Through that interaction, Rivas explained they found out that the documentary’s production company had ties to Judge Makintach’s brother, Juan Makintach. Police also indicated that they had seen a camera in the courtroom, allegedly approved by Judge Makintach. On May 20, prosecutor Patricio Ferrari called for the trial to be paused for a week while the incident was reviewed. Footage was presented to the court from the documentary, showing the start of the trial. It appeared to feature the judge as a central figure. Judge Makintach has denied wrongdoing. But Ferrari argued, “The situation compromises the prestige of the judiciary.” It is unclear whether a new judge will replace Makintach in the coming months.",

    "title": "Brazilian prosecutors sue Chinese carmaker BYD over labour conditions",
    "article_text": "Brazilian labour prosecutors have filed a lawsuit against the Chineseauto manufacturerBYD and two contractors over allegations of illegally trafficking labourers to live and work under conditions “analogous to slavery”. On Tuesday, the prosecutors, charged with enforcing labour laws, said in a statement that they would seek 257 million reais ($45m) in damages from BYD as well as contractors China JinJiang Construction Brazil and Tecmonta Equipamentos Inteligentes. They accused the three companies of trafficking Chinese workers to build a BYD plant in Camacari, in the northeastern state of Bahia. There, the prosecutors allege that the companies subjected the workers to “extremely degrading” conditions. “In December last year, 220 Chinese workers were found to be in conditions analogous to slavery and victims of international human trafficking,” the statement said. The damages the prosecutors are seeking amount to a penalty of 50,000 reais ($8,867) per violation, multiplied by the number of workers affected, in addition to moral damages. The lawsuit is the result of a police raid in December 2024, during which authorities say they “rescued” 163 Chinese workers from Jinjiang and 57 from Tecmonta. The prosecutors say the workers were victims of international human trafficking and were brought to Brazil with visas that did not fit their jobs. They also allege that conditions at the construction site left the labourers almost totally dependent on their employers, by withholding up to 70 percent of their wages and imposing high contract termination costs. Some of the workers even had their passports taken away, limiting their ability to leave, according to the prosecutors. The lawsuit also describes meagre living conditions, including some beds without mattresses. “In one dormitory, only one toilet was identified for use by 31 people, forcing workers to wake up around 4am to wash themselves before starting their workday,” the prosecutors’ statement notes. Brazil is thelargest marketfor BYD outside China. The Chinese auto giant has said that it is committed to human rights, is cooperating with authorities and will respond to the lawsuit in court. A spokesman for the company said in December that allegations of poor working conditions were part of an effort to “smear” China and Chinese companies. But the Brazilian labour prosecutors rejected the notion that their lawsuit was based on anti-Chinese sentiment. “Our lawsuit is very well-founded, with a substantial amount of evidence provided during the investigation process,” deputy labour prosecutor Fabio Leal said in an interview. He stated that the workers, who have all returned to China, would receive any payments related to the lawsuit there, with the companies in Brazil responsible for providing proof of payment.",

    "title": "US pauses student visa processing amid plans to up social media vetting",
    "article_text": "The administration of United States President Donald Trump is temporarily suspending the processing of visas for foreign students, according to an internal memo from Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The cable, widely reported by US media on Tuesday, ordered embassies and consulates not to allow “any additional student or exchange visa… appointment capacity until further guidance is issued”. It added that the State Department “plans to issue guidance on expanded social media vetting for all such applications”. The move is the latest blow to foreign nationals seeking to study in the US, as the Trump administrationintensifies pressureon universities and students alike. The administration last week revoked Harvard University’s approval for enrolling international students, amid a wider standoff over the school’s response to pro-Palestine protests and its diversity programmes. A federal judge has temporarily blocked the move. The processing pause also comes as Rubio hassought to rescindhundreds of visas for foreign students, citing minor legal infractions or pro-Palestine speech or advocacy. Speaking on Tuesday, US State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce did not directly respond to the cable, but said broadly, “We take very seriously the process of vetting who it is that comes into the country.” “It’s a goal, as stated by the president and Secretary Rubio, to make sure that people who are here understand what the law is, that they don’t have any criminal intent, that they are going to be contributors to the experience here, however short or long their status,” she said. Bruce added that those applying for student visas should continue to proceed normally, but should expect higher scrutiny. “If you’re going to be applying for a visa, follow the normal process, the normal steps, [and] expect to be looked at,” she said. Rubio’s cable did not give a timeline for the suspension, but told diplomatic staff they should receive guidance in the “coming days”. TheTrump administration’s actionstowards higher education have raised thorny constitutional questions about academic freedom and the rights of individuals living in the US on temporary visas. Last week, Rubio told lawmakers in the US Senate that he had revoked “thousands” of visas since Trump took office on January 20, although a full accounting has not been released. Rubio has relied on an obscure law that the administration maintains grants broad powers to remove foreigners whose presence in the US they deem to be counter to US foreign policy interests. Lawyers for several students targeted by Rubio for their pro-Palestine views – includingMahmoud Khalil,Rumeysa Ozturk, Mohsen Mahdawi and Badar Khan Suri – have maintained that their clients’ freedom of speech rights are being trampled. Meanwhile, Harvard University has also said the Trump administration is violating its rights by cutting funding and revoking its ability to enrol foreign students. US media also reported on Tuesday that Trump’s administration wasexpected to soon severthe remaining federal contracts with Harvard, in what would be the latest escalation.",

    "title": "Sudan says cholera outbreak killed 172 people in a week",
    "article_text": "Sudan’s Ministry of Health has reported a spike in cholera cases in the war-torn country, with 2,700 infections and 172 deaths in the past week. In a statement on Tuesday, the ministry said 90 percent of cases were reported in Khartoum state, where water and electricity supply have been severely disrupted in recent weeks by drone strikes blamed on the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF),at war with the armysince April 2023. Cases were also reported in the south, centre and north of the country. Cholera is endemic to Sudan, but outbreaks have become far worse and more frequent since the war broke out, wrecking already fragile water and sanitation and health infrastructure. Last Tuesday, the ministry said 51 people had died of cholera out of more than 2,300 reported cases over the past three weeks, 90 percent of them in Khartoum state. The RSF this month launched drone strikes across Khartoum, including on three power stations, before being completely pushed out of their last holdout positions in the capital last week. The strikes knocked the electricity – and subsequently the local water network – out of service, according to Doctors Without Borders (MSF), forcing residents to turn to unsafe water sources. “Water treatment stations no longer have electricity and cannot provide clean water from the Nile,” Slaymen Ammar, MSF’s medical coordinator in Khartoum, said in a statement. Cholera, an acute diarrhoeal illness caused by ingesting contaminated water or food, can kill within hours if untreated. Yet, it is easily preventable and treatable when clean water, sanitation and timely medical care are available. Sudan’s already fragile healthcare system has been pushed to the “breaking point” by the war, according to the World Health Organization. Up to 90 percent of the country’s hospitals have at some point been forced to close because of the fighting, according to the doctors’ union, with health facilities regularly stormed, bombed and looted. The war, now in its third year, has killed tens of thousands, displaced 13 million and created the world’s largest displacement and hunger crisis.",

    "title": "Texas to require age verification for app purchases",
    "article_text": "Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed into law a bill requiring Apple and Alphabet’s Google to verify the age of users of their app stores, putting the second most populous state in the United States at the centre of a debate over whether and how to regulate smartphone use by children and teenagers. The bill was signed into law on Tuesday. The law, which goes into effect on January 1, requires parental consent to download apps or make in-app purchases for users aged below 18. Utah was the first US state to pass a similar law this year, and US lawmakers have also introduced a federal bill. Another Texas bill, passed in the state’s House of Representatives and awaiting a Senate vote, would restrict social media apps to users over the age of 18. Age limits and parental consent for social media apps are among the few areas of wide US consensus. A Pew Research poll in 2023 indicated that 81 percent of Americans support requiring parental consent for children to create social media accounts and 71 percent supported age verification before using social media. The effect of social media on children’s mental health has become a growing global concern. Dozens of US states have sued Meta Platforms, and the US surgeon general has issued an advisory on safeguards for children. Australia last year banned social media for children under 16, with other countries such as Norway also considering new rules. How to implement age restrictions has caused a conflict between Meta, the owner of Instagram and Facebook, and Apple and Google, which own the two dominant US app stores. Meta and the social media companies Snap and X applauded the passage of the bill. “Parents want a one-stop shop to verify their child’s age and grant permission for them to download apps in a privacy-preserving way. The app store is the best place for it, and more than one-third of US states have introduced bills recognising the central role app stores play,” the companies said. Kathleen Farley, vice president of litigation for the Chamber of Progress, a group backed by Apple and Alphabet, said the Texas law is likely to face legal challenges on First Amendment grounds. “A big path for challenge is that it burdens adult speech in attempting to regulate children’s speech,” Farley told the Reuters news agency in an interview on Tuesday. “I would say there are arguments that this is a content-based regulation singling out digital communication.” Child online safety groups that backed the Texas bill have also long argued for app store age verification, saying it is the only way to give parents effective control over children’s use of technology. “The problem is that self-regulation in the digital marketplace has failed, where app stores have just prioritised the profit over safety and rights of children and families,” Casey Stefanski, executive director for the Digital Childhood Alliance, told Reuters. Apple and Google opposed the Texas bill, saying it imposes blanket requirements to share age data with all apps, even when those apps are uncontroversial. “If enacted, app marketplaces will be required to collect and keep sensitive personal identifying information for every Texan who wants to download an app, even if it’s an app that simply provides weather updates or sports scores,” Apple said in a statement. Google and Apple each have their own proposal that involves sharing age range data only with apps that require it, rather than all apps. “We see a role for legislation here,” Kareem Ghanem, senior director of government affairs and public policy at Google, told Reuters. “It’s just got to be done in the right way, and it’s got to hold the feet of [Meta CEO Mark] Zuckerberg and the social media companies to the fire because it’s the harm to kids and teens on those sites that’s really inspired people to take a closer look here and see how we can all do better.”",

    "title": "US judge temporarily bars Trump admin from ending NYC congestion pricing",
    "article_text": "New York City has won a temporary reprieve in its legal battle against the administration of US President Donald Trump, which had threatened to withhold federal funding from New York state unless the city ended its congestion pricing programme. United States District Judge Lewis Liman held the hearing on the matter on Tuesday and granted a temporary restraining order that will allow the programme to keep running until at least June 9 as the administration and state-level officials battle over the future of congestion pricing. A day earlier, US Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said he believed the federal government would withhold government approvals in the state, which would have frozen contracts for highway and transit projects. Congestion pricing is likely to move forward indefinitely despite the federal administration’s objections because the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) – New York City’s mass transit system, which is operated as a state-level agency – “showed a likelihood of success”, according to the judge. The courts said this is because the plan was already reviewed by state, local and federal agencies, according to the New York Times newspaper. “Congestion relief is perfectly legal and thoroughly vetted. Opponents exhausted all plausible arguments against the programme, and now the increasingly outlandish theories are falling flat, too,” Danny Pearlstein, policy and communications director for the Riders Alliance, a transportation advocacy group, told Al Jazeera. New York Governor Kathy Hochul called the judge’s decision “a massive victory” for New York commuters. “So here’s the deal: Secretary Duffy can issue as many letters and social media posts as he wants, but a court has blocked the Trump Administration from retaliating against New York for reducing traffic and investing in transit … Congestion pricing is legal, it’s working and we’re keeping the cameras on,” the governor’s office said in a statement. “It’s really upsetting that it came to this point to begin with. We should not be in a position where the federal government is trying to stop New York state from enacting its own policy and trying to blackmail New York state when it doesn’t follow their [the US Department of Transportation’s] lead,” Alexa Sledge, communications director for the advocacy group Transportation Alternatives, told Al Jazeera. New York state launched the programme in January. Drivers have to pay congestion pricing tolls of $9 per day for driving during peak times in parts of Manhattan. The state made the programme in an effort to cut congestion in the nation’s most populous city as well as raise funds for NYC’s mass transit system. “New York state should be able to make their own laws, and they should be able to run their own streets. And so hopefully, this can be the end of this,” Sledge said. Since the programme began earlier this year, it has fulfilled many of its goals. Within a month of congestion pricing, subway ridership increased by six percent, and bus ridership by nine percent. Traffic decreased by 11 percent. In March, the MTA forecasted that congestion pricing would bring in $500m in revenue for the system, which will fund a swath of new transit-system projects including station upgrades and zero-emissions buses. At the time,a Siena College pollfound that 42 percent of New Yorkers wanted to keep the programme, while 35 percent wanted to get rid of it. Neither the MTA nor the US Department of Transportation was immediately available for comment.",

    "title": "Mapping Israel’s military campaign in the occupied West Bank",
    "article_text": "Israel is applying many of the tactics used in its war on Gaza to seize and control territory across the occupied West Bank during its Operation Iron Wall campaign, a new report says. Israel launched the operation in January. Defending what the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA)termed “by far the longest and most destructive operation in the occupied West Bank since the second intifada in the 2000s”, the Israeli military claimed its intention was to preserve its “freedom of action” within the Palestinian territoryas it continuedto rip up roads and destroy buildings, infrastructure, and water and electricity lines. The report by the British research group Forensic Architecture suggested Israel has imposed what researchers call a system of “spatial control”, essentially a series of mechanisms that allow it to deploy military units across Palestinian territory at will. The report focused on Israeli action in the refugee camps of Jenin and Far’a in the northern West Bank and Nur Shams and Tulkarem in the northwestern West Bank. Researchers interviewed and analysed witness statements, satellite imagery and hundreds of videos to demonstrate a systematic plan of coordinated Israeli action intended to impose a network of military control in refugee camps across the West Bank similar to that imposed upon Gaza. In the process, existing roads have been widened while homes, private gardens and adjacent properties have been demolished to allow for the rapid deployment of Israeli military vehicles. “This network of military routes is clearly visible in the Jenin refugee camp and evidence indicates that the same tactic is, at the time of publication, being repeated in the Nur Shams and Tulkarm refugee camps,” the report’s authors noted. Israeli ministers have previously stated that they planned to use the same methods in the West Bank that have destroyed the Gaza Strip, leading to more than 54,000 Palestinians killed and the majority of buildings damaged or destroyed. In January,Defence Minister Israel Katzsaid Israel would apply the “lesson” of “repeated raids in Gaza” to the Jenin refugee camp. The following month, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who has control over much of the administration of the West Bank,boasted that“Tulkarem and Jenin will look like Jabalia and Shujayea. Nablus and Ramallah will resemble Rafah and Khan Younis,” comparing refugee camps in the West Bank to areas in Gaza that have been devastated by Israeli bombing and ground offensives. “They will also be turned into uninhabitable ruins, and their residents will be forced to migrate and seek a new life in other countries,” Smotrich said. Hamze Attar, a Luxembourg-based defence analyst, told Al Jazeera these tactics are not new in Palestinian territory, having first been deployed by the British during their mandate over historic Palestine, which preceded Israel’s foundation in 1948. “It’s part of the “counterinsurgency” strategy,” he said. “Bigger roads [mean] easy access to forces – bigger roads, less congested battle management; bigger roads, less ability for fighters to escape from house to house.” About 75,000 Palestinians live in the Jenin, Nur Shams, Far’a and Tulkarem refugee camps. They were either displaced themselves or descended from those displaced during the Nakba (which means “catastrophe”) when roughly 750,000 Palestinians were forced from their homes by Zionist forces from1947 to 1949as part of the creation of Israel. Now, at least 40,000 of those living in the West Bank refugee camps have been displaced as a result of Operation Iron Wall, according to the United Nations. As in Gaza, many of these people were forced from their homes on orders from the Israeli military, which researchers said have been “weaponised” against the local population. Once an area had been cleared of its buildings and roads, it becomes a kill zone and the Israeli military is free to reshape and build whatever it likes without interference from residents, the report said. “Such engineered mass displacement has allowed the Israeli military to reshape these built environments unobstructed,” the report noted, adding that when Palestinian residents did try to return to their homes after Israeli military action, they were often obstructed by the continued presence of troops. Forensic Architecture researchers said Israeli attacks on medical facilities in Gaza have also spilled over into the West Bank. “Israeli attacks on medical infrastructure in the West Bank have included placing hospitals under siege, obstructing ambulance access to areas with injured civilians, targeting medical personnel, and using at least one medical facility as a detention and interrogation centre,” the report said. During Israel’s initial attacks on the Jenin refugee camp on January 21, multiple hospitals were surrounded by the Israeli military, including Jenin Government Hospital, al-Amal Hospital and al-Razi Hospital, researchers noted. The following day, civilians and hospital staff reported that the main road leading to Jenin Government Hospital was destroyed by Israeli military bulldozers and access to the hospital was blocked by newly constructed berms, or land barriers, On February 4, reports from Jenin said the Israeli military was obstructing ambulances carrying injured people from reaching the hospital. Also carrying unmistakable echoes of Gaza was anUNRWA report in early Februarysaying the Israeli military had forcibly co-opted one of the health centres at the UNRWA-run Arroub camp near Jerusalem as an interrogation and detention site. The attacks on healthcare facilities were part of a wider campaign to damage civilian infrastructure in the West Bank, the Forensic Architecture report said, using armoured bulldozers, controlled demolitions and air attacks. Researchers said they verified more than 200 examples of Israeli soldiers deliberately destroying buildings and street networks in all four of the refugee camps with armoured bulldozers reducing civilian roads to barely passable piles of exposed earth and rubble. Civilian property, including parked vehicles, food carts and agricultural buildings, such as greenhouses, were also destroyed during Israeli military operations, they said.",

    "article_text": "Saudi Arabia has announced that the annualHajj pilgrimagewill begin on June 4 after observatories confirmed the sighting of the crescent moon. The announcement was made on Tuesday by the kingdom’s Supreme Court in a statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency. At a news conference on Monday, Saudi Hajj Minister Tawfiq al-Rabiah said more than one million pilgrims from around the world had already arrived in the country. The Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam and must be undertaken at least once by all Muslims who are able to. The pilgrimage occurs annually between the eighth and 13th days of Dhul-Hijjah, the 12th and final month on the Islamic lunar calendar. Worshippers take part in four days of ceremonies with the high point coming on the second day with mass outdoor prayers on Mount Arafat, the hill where the Prophet Muhammad delivered his last sermon. Around the world, many Muslims choose to fast on this day. Many pilgrims also visit the city of Medina, home to the Prophet Muhammad’s tomb and the second holiest site in Islam. While not an official part of the Hajj, visiting Medina remains a significant spiritual experience for many Muslims. This year, the day of Arafat will fall on June 5, followed by Eid al-Adha on June 6, according to Saudi authorities. Last year, 1.8 million people took part in the pilgrimage, according to official figures. During the 2024 Hajj, temperatures soared to 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 degrees Fahrenheit), and more than 1,300 pilgrims died, raising concerns about the growing risks of extreme heat during the Saudi summer.",

    "title": "Photos: Thousands of Palestinians crowd a controversial aid centre in Gaza",
    "article_text": "Thousands of Palestinians haveoverwhelmeda food distribution centre in southern Gaza, driven by hunger after nearly three months without access to fresh supplies. It was a chaotic scene on Tuesday in the southern city of Rafah, as men, women and children thronged the aid centre, seeking food to stave off malnutrition and starvation. Israeli soldiers used gunfire to disperse the desperate crowds, as they tugged at the fences separating them from food boxes. Gaza’s Government Media Office reported that three Palestinians were killed and 46 wounded at the site. Several more remained missing. Starting on March 2, Israel had imposed a total blockade on aid into war-torn Gaza, as part of the military offensive it began in the Palestinian enclave in October 2023. As fears of famine grew, so too did international pressure on Israel. Allies including theUnited Kingdom, France and Canadawarned Israel earlier this month that it could face sanctions if aid restrictions were not lifted. Days later, Israel announced it would allow“minimal” deliveriesof essential suppliesto resume. But that announcement wascontroversial, not least for Israel’s decision to bypass traditional aid distribution networks, like those run by the United Nations. Instead, it tapped theGaza Humanitarian Foundation(GHF), a United States-backed nonprofit, to lead the effort. “There were a lot of questions raised, even within the Israeli government, about how exactly this was going to operate,” said Al Jazeera correspondent Hamdah Salhut, reporting from Amman, Jordan. “Now, as you can see here, the private company that was put in place to distribute this aid has completely lost control.” Israel has blamed the armed Palestinian group Hamas for the chaos at the aid centre, something the group has denied.In a statement released on Tuesday, Hamas instead blamed Israel for failing to “manage the humanitarian crisis it deliberately created”. Al Jazeera correspondent Mohamed Vall also reported there was no evidence that Hamas has disrupted the aid distribution. He instead pointed to the sheer need: More than two million Palestinians live in Gaza. “These are the people of Gaza, the civilians of Gaza, trying to get just a piece of food — just any piece of food for their children, for themselves,” he said. Vall added that there was also scepticism on the ground about the motives behind concentrating aid distribution in the south of Gaza. “They say the reason why [Israeli officials] did this, the reason why they established these distribution points only in the south is that they want to encourage people — or even force them — to flee from the north,” Vall explained. The fear remains, he said, that moving Palestinians southwards could be a “preliminary phase for the complete ousting” of Gaza’s population. According to Gaza’s Ministry of Health, at least 54,056 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the war, which humanitarian aid groups and United Nations experts havecompared to a genocide. Here are some scenes from Tuesday’s aid distribution efforts.",

    "title": "Trump administration to cut remaining US federal contracts with Harvard",
    "article_text": "The administration of US President Donald Trump will move to sever remaining federal contracts withHarvard University, escalating a row centred on issues such as pro-Palestine student activism and racial diversity. The New York Times and Reuters news agency reported on Tuesday that a draft letter from the General Services Administration (GSA) instructs all federal agencies to review and possibly cancel existing contracts with Harvard, worth an estimated $100m. A copy of the draft letter shared by the Times states thatHarvardhas continued to engage in “race discrimination, including in its admissions process” and that the university’s failure to halt alleged acts of anti-Semitism suggests a “disturbing lack of concern for the safety and wellbeing of Jewish students”. The move would be the latest effort by the government to use federal funds to force universities to accept changes sought by the Trump administration, including greater control over curricula, harsher steps againstpro-Palestine students, and an end to policies that encourage racial diversity and greater opportunities for racial minorities. The Trump administration has portrayed efforts to encourage greater racial diversity at US universities as a form of discrimination that prioritises racial identity over merit. Supporters say that such efforts, such as using race as one factor of many inadmissions decisions, are necessary to remedy long histories of racist discrimination and exclusion in US higher education. “GSA understands that Harvard continues to engage in race discrimination, including in its admissions process and in other areas of student life,” the letter reads. The administration has also taken an aggressive stance on pro-Palestine activism on university campuses, which erupted after the beginning of Israel’s most recent war in Gaza in October 2023. Critics have portrayed those steps as part of a larger assault on US universities, which Trump has depicted as hotbeds of political dissent and radical ideas at odds with the goals of his administration. “The Trump administration has gone after Harvard because of the pro-Palestinian protests, and also has made a list of demands that goes far beyond any of that,” Al Jazeera correspondent Patty Culhane reported from Cambridge, Massachusetts, where Harvard is located. “It wants detailed information on foreign students that Harvard is refusing to give. It wants basically a political audit to see where people’s ideologies are. So Harvard University has sued in court to stop many of these moves, and this will undoubtedly be the next one that goes before a judge.” In March, the GSA and the Departments of Education (DOE) and Health and Human Services (HHS) announced an official review of $255.6m in Harvard contracts and $8.7bn in multi-year grants, stating that the review was part of an effort to combat alleged anti-Semitism on college campuses. The administration also cut $400m in grants to Columbia University in New York City in March, despite a series of concessions to government demands. The administration has said thatcampus protestsagainst Israel’s war in Gaza and the US provision of billions of dollars of weapons to Israel are driven by anti-Semitism and create an unsafe environment for Jewish students on campus. Several international students have been arrested and detained by the administration for their involvement in pro-Palestine activism, including a Turkish international student named Rumeysa Ozturk at Tufts University,who was arrestedon the street by federal agents for co-signing an op-ed calling for an end to the war. Trump hasconsistently threatenedto revoke Harvard’s tax-exempt status, and moved last week to block the university’s ability to accept international students, who currently make up about 27 percent of the university’s total enrolment. A judgeblocked that effort, which Harvard had called an act of retaliation for “our refusal to surrender our academic independence and to submit to the federal government’s illegal assertion of control over our curriculum, our faculty, and our student body”.",

    "title": "French lawmakers approve assisted dying bill",
    "article_text": "France’s lower house of parliament has approved a right-to-die bill in the first reading, taking an initial step in the lengthy process to pass legislation. A total of 305 lawmakers in the National Assembly approved the legislation on Tuesday while 199 deputies voted against the bill to grant patients medical assistance to end their lives in defined circumstances. The text has thebackingof President Emmanuel Macron but is opposed by some conservative groups. In a statement on X, Macron praised the approval of the bill as “an important step” on “the path of fraternity”. “The National Assembly’s vote on legislation concerning the development of palliative care and assisted dying is an important step,” Macron posted. “With respect for sensitivities, doubts and hopes, the path of fraternity that I hoped for is gradually opening up.” The legislation will be sent to the French Senate for further debate. Months could be required to schedule a definitive vote on the measure, given France’s long and complex parliamentary process. The National Assembly has the final say over the Senate. The legislation is expected to eventually pass as polls indicated that more than 90 percent of French people are in favour of laws that give people with terminal diseases or going through interminable suffering the right to die. The proposed measure definesassisted dyingas allowing people to use lethal medication under certain conditions. They may take it themselves, or those whose physical conditions don’t allow them to do so alone would be able to get help from a doctor or nurse. To benefit, patients would need to be over 18, be French citizens or live in France. A team of medical professionals would need to confirm that the patient has a grave and incurable illness “at an advanced or terminal stage”, is suffering from intolerable and untreatable pain, and is seeking lethal medication of their own free will. Patients with severe psychiatric conditions and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease will not be eligible. A person would initiate the request for lethal medication and confirm the request after a period of reflection. If approved, a doctor would deliver a prescription for the lethal medication, which could be taken at home, a nursing home or a healthcare facility. A 2023 report indicated that most French citizens back legalising end-of-life options, and opinion polls showed growing support over the past 20 years. Initial discussions in parliament last year were abruptly interrupted by Macron’s decision to dissolve the National Assembly, plunging France into a months-long political crisis.",

    "title": "‘Deliberate massacre’ in Gaza as starving Palestinians seek Israeli-US aid",
    "article_text": "At least three people have died and dozens have been injured in war-ravaged Gaza as thousands of starving Palestinians attempted to get food from a controversial Israeli-United States organisation, laying bare the scale of the catastrophe inflicted on the enclave by Israel’s three-month blockade of aid. In punishing midday heat on Tuesday, thousands of Palestinians clambered over fences andpushed through packed crowdsto reach life-saving supplies brought by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a new and controversial group tasked with the delivery of aid to Palestinians in the besieged enclave. Amid the buzz of Israeli military helicopters overhead and gunfire rattling in the background, desperate crowds, including women and children, in southern Gaza’s Rafah area struggled to reach the food distribution point on the GHF’s first day of operation. “We have been dying of starvation. We have to feed our children who want to eat. What else can we do? I could do anything to feed them,” a Palestinian father told Al Jazeera. “We saw people running, and we followed them, even if it meant taking a risk, and it was scary. But fear is not worse than starvation.” Apart from the deaths and injuries, several people also went missing in the ensuing stampede, officials in Gaza said, with the incident coming amid widespread hunger andrelentless Israeli bombingof Palestinian civilians, including children. “The occupation forces, positioned in or around those areas, opened live fire on starving civilians who were lured to these locations under the pretence of receiving aid,” Gaza’s Government Media Office said in a statement, adding that the incident “provides undeniable evidence of the Israeli occupation’s total failure in managing the humanitarian catastrophe it has deliberately created”. “What happened today in Rafah is a deliberate massacre and a full-fledged war crime, committed in cold blood against civilians weakened by over 90 days of siege-induced starvation.” In a statement earlier, the Israeli military said its forces did not direct gunfire towards the Palestinians but rather fired warning shots in an outside area. It claimed that control over the situation had been established and aid distribution would continue as planned. A post shared by AJ+ (@ajplus) The aid by GHF, a foundation backed by the US and endorsed by Israel, arrived in Gaza despite allegations that the new group did not have the experience or capacity to bring relief to more than 2 million Palestinians in Gaza. The United Nations and aid groups say the organisation does not abide by humanitarian principles and could serve to further displace people from their homes as Palestinians move to receive aid from a limited number of distribution sites. UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said that seeing thousands of Palestinians storming the aid site was “heartbreaking“. “We and our partners have a detailed, principled, operationally sound plan supported by member states to get aid to a desperate population,” he told reporters. “We continue to stress that a meaningful scale-up of humanitarian operations is essential to stave off famine and meet the needs of all civilians wherever they are.” The chaos underscored the staggering level of hunger gripping Gaza. According to the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification report, 1.95 million people – 93 percent of the enclave’s population – are facing acute food shortages. Aid groups have warned for months that Israel is using starvation in Gaza as a weapon of war. “This is not how aid is done,” Ahmed Bayram, spokesperson for the Norwegian Refugee Council, told Al Jazeera, describing the scene in Rafah as the “inevitable consequence of a reckless and inhumane plan”. “These are the scenes we have literally been warning about all month now. It spread chaos. It spread confusion. And this is the result,” he said. “I think the best thing that can be done now is for this plan to be cancelled, to be reversed, and for us professional humanitarians in the UN and NGOs to do our job. There are tonnes and tonnes of aid waiting across the border. [It’s a] very simple decision: open the gates and keep them open.” Israel made the GHF, a Swiss-based entity formed in February through back-channel meetings between Israeli-linked officials and business figures, a lead aid distributor. Meanwhile, Israel has blocked the UN and other international organisations from bringing in aid. Despite being promoted as a neutral body, the GHF’s close ties to Israel and the US have prompted widespread condemnation. Its former head suddenly resigned this week, citing the foundation’s inability to uphold the core humanitarian principles of “neutrality, impartiality and independence”. According to a report in The New York Times, the GHF emerged from “private meetings of like-minded officials, military officers and businesspeople with close ties to the Israeli government”. Israel has said its forces are not involved in the physical distribution of aid, although it backs the system’s use of biometric screening, including facial recognition, to vet aid recipients. Palestinians fear it is another Israeli tool of surveillance and repression. Critics have also warned that the GHF’s structure – and its concentration of aid in southern Gaza – could serve to depopulate northern Gaza, as planned by the Israeli military. While the previous UN-led distribution network operated about 400 sites across the Strip, the GHF has set up only four “mega-sites” for Gaza’s 2.3 million residents. In Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary reported that many of the food parcels being handed out were inadequate to sustain families. Khoudary described a typical food box with 4kg (8.8lb) of flour, a couple of bags of pasta, two cans of fava beans, a pack of tea bags and some biscuits. Other food parcels contained lentils and soup in small quantities. Although the GHF said it distributed about 8,000 food boxes on Tuesday, which it claimed amounted to 462,000 meals, Khoudary said the rations would barely sustain a single family for long. “This is definitely not enough, and it is not enough for all the humiliation that Palestinians are going through to receive these food parcels,” she said.",

    "title": "Key takeaways from King Charles’s ‘Speech from the Throne’ in Canada",
    "article_text": "King Charles III has delivered a rare royal speech from Canada’s Parliament, emphasising the country’s sovereignty in a new era of “dangerous and uncertain” times. The so-called “Speech from the Throne” on Tuesday was historic. It represented both thefirst timeCharles had given an address from Canada since becoming king and only the third time the annual speech kicking off the parliamentary session had been delivered by a British monarch, not a lower representative of the Crown. Speaking from the Senate in Ottawa, Charles sought to ground the event as taking place during an equally historic “epoch”. During the statements, the disruptive policies of United States President Donald Trump, who has launched a trade war with Canada andthreatenedto make the country the US’s “51st state”, loomed large. The king recalled his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, giving the first “Speech from the Throne” in 1957, in the wake of World War II and as the Cold War intensified. “In the decades since, history has been punctuated by epoch-making events: the Vietnam War, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the start of the war on terror,” he said. “Today, Canada faces another critical moment. The world is a more dangerous and uncertain place than at any point since World War II. Canada is facing challenges that are unprecedented in our lifetimes.” Here were the key takeaways from the speech: The Trump administration was only directly mentioned once during the speech, but the policies pursued since Trump took office on January 20 loomed large. In his opening statements, Charles said he felt a “deep sense of pride” as he and his wife, Camilla, witnessed “Canadians coming together in a renewed sense of national pride, unity and hope”. “Democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, self-determination and freedom are values which Canadians hold dear, and ones which the government is determined to protect,” he said, later adding that the government was rebuilding, rearming and reinvesting in the Canadian Armed Forces – and strengthening alliances with Europe – to “protect Canada’s sovereignty”. Speaking to Al Jazeera, Justin Vovk, a royal historian at McMaster University in Ontario, said the speech puts further weight behind Canada as it faces pressure from the US. While the address was actually written by Canada’s government, led by Prime Minister Mark Carney, Charles would have had to “approve the speech”. “He would have acknowledged his comfort with saying all of the things he said,” said Vovk. “So it reaffirmed the fact that Canada does have its own identity on the world stage – that Canada is not abdicating its place and its role in international alliances.” But far from a tirade against Trump, Vovk noted that Charles’s speech was especially significant for the careful tone it took towards the US. That was particularly true when it came to references to Trump’stariffs on Canada, and the tensions they have created for the longtime trading partners. “The system of open global trade that, while not perfect, has helped to deliver prosperity for Canadians for decades, is changing,” Charles acknowledged early on. “Canada’s relationships with partners are also changing.” But moments later, Charles hailed shifting Canada-US ties as an example of the new opportunities created by change, in his only direct reference to Trump. “The prime minister and the president of the United States, for example, have begun defining a new economic and security relationship between Canada and the United States,” he said, “rooted in mutual respect and founded on common interests to deliver transformational benefits for both sovereign nations.” In striking that balance, the speech was “actually quite remarkable”, historian Vovk said. “There was really that emphasis on cooperation between Canada and the United States,” he said. “I think there was a lot in that speech that Donald Trump should or will likely be happy about.” One notable message to Trump came in a reference to US-Canada border issues. Prior to imposing 25 percent tariffs on many Canadian goods, Trump had called on Canada to crack down on immigration and drug trafficking – particularly fentanyl – at the border. Critics derided the pressure campaign as exceptionally misguided, as only 27kg (59 pounds) of fentanyl were seized at the US-Canada border from 2022 to 2024, accounting for 0.1 percent of the seizures of the drug by US authorities during that period, according to Canadian government data. Nevertheless, Charles hailed soon-to-be-introduced legislation that would seek to “enhance security at Canada’s borders”. “Law enforcement and intelligence agencies will have new tools to stop the flow of fentanyl and its precursors,” he said. Charles also referenced immigration, saying Canada’s government would “bring balance” to the issue. That echoed a campaign promise from Carney, who had contended with pushback over former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s immigration policies. Other key issues for thenewly elected prime minister– whose Liberal Party won the most seats, 170, in the 343-member House of Commons in April – also got mention in the speech. Charles pointed to the country’s housing crisis, and Carney’s plan to surge construction of prefabricated and modular housing. He pointed to efforts to remove “barriers to trade and labour mobility” across Canada’s 13 provinces. He also referenced plans to speed up energy projects, saying the changes will “unleash a new era of growth that will ensure we don’t just survive ongoing trade wars, but emerge from them stronger than ever”. Charles also pointed to the unique relationship with Indigenous groups like the Inuit and Metis peoples, with many treaties with the Crown predating the 1867 founding of Canada. He supported efforts for “reconciliation” – or repairing historical harm – ongoing between the groups and the Canadian government. “It is my great hope that in each of your communities and collectively as a country, a path is found towards truth and reconciliation in both word and deed,” the monarch said.",

    "title": "Silhouetted by fire, six-year-old girl survives Israeli attack in Gaza",
    "article_text": "Ward Khalil stares at the camera, her eyes barely focusing as she recalls the horrors of what she experienced. “When I woke up, I found a huge fire, and I saw my mom was dead,” she says, recounting the Israeli air attack early on Monday that she survived but that killed her mother, two of her siblings and 33 other people. Video footage of six-year-old Ward, her small body silhouetted against the flames after theattack on the Fahmi al-Jarjawi Schoolin Gaza City, has shocked people around the world, highlighting the ferocity of Israel’s attacks on Gaza. Ward’s father and a brother also survived the attack, but they both remain in hospital. The school had been sheltering several families, including many children, when it was targeted by Israeli fire. “I walked in the fire so I could escape. … I was in the fire, and the ceiling fell on me. The ceiling all collapsed. The fire was blazing,” Ward recounted, the distress clear in her voice. “See? My arm is burned here,” she said, showing the camera the injuries. Ward sobbed as she explained what happened to her family: “They were martyred. May God forgive them.” Footage taken from the school after the attack shows blood-stained walls and charred mattresses lying on the floor as rescue workers and distraught relatives search the rubble and burned clothing for signs of survivors. Eyad al-Sheikh Khalil, Ward’s uncle, rushed to the school after seeing a picture of her online. “I was looking at the pictures journalists were posting, and I saw a photo of Ward with the Civil Defence and realised it was my niece,” he said of the images of Ward being comforted by rescue workers near the school, the bright bows in her hair dulled by the ash from the fire. “When someone comes out of an attack like this, in a war like this, what do you expect a kid to feel?” Eyad asked. “Of course she’s going to suffer mentally. We’re all suffering mentally.” “It was indescribable,” a survivor who was pulled from the rubble with her son told rescuers. “Body parts, charred bodies, the smell of burning. I swear to God, our hearts have died. We’re shaken, exhausted. Enough.” Displaced people in Gaza have beencrowding into schools, many of which are affiliated with the United Nations, since the onset of Israel’s war on the enclave in October 2023. On May 7, Israeli forces targeted a single school sheltering 2,000 Palestinians twiceon the same day, killing at least 29 civilians in the Bureij refugee camp, including women and children. According to UNRWA, the UN aid agency for Palestinian refugees, nearly three-quarters of all school buildings in Gaza have been directly hit by Israeli fire since October 2023. According to UN satellite-based assessments, 95 per cent of Gaza’s schools have sustained damage, rendering the vast majority unusable. UN-run shelters are now “overwhelmed with displaced people desperately seeking safety”, UNRWA said in an update after the attack on the Fahmi al-Jarjawi School. It also stressed that the lack of food in Gaza due to a three-month siege imposed upon the territory by Israel hadadded to people’s suffering. “Many families are sheltering in abandoned, unfinished, or damaged buildings,” the agency explained. “Sanitation conditions are dire; in some cases, hundreds of people are having to share a single toilet. Others, including children and pregnant women, are sleeping in the open.”",

    "article_text": "The company’s sales in Europe plunged by nearly 50 percent, a sign that Tesla’s brand crisis is worsening. The company’s sales in Europe plunged by nearly 50 percent, a sign that Tesla’s brand crisis is worsening. byAndrew J. Hawkins We don’t typically report on monthly sales data for one car company in one market, but this one seems particularly notable given all that’s going on in the world. In another sign that Elon Musk’s company is in a real tough spot, Tesla is getting absolutely demolished in Europe. The company’s sales in the EU, UK, and European Free Trade Association fell a staggering 49 percent in April year over year, even as overall battery-electric vehicle sales rose. The new figures fromthe European Automobiles Manufacturers Associationrevealed that Tesla only logged 7,261 new vehicle registrations in April, nearly half of what it recorded in April 2024. The numbers are particularly notable considering Tesla recently launchedthe refreshed Model Y, an update on the global best-seller which was expected to attract a host of new customers. Instead, it appears the strategy has so far been a failure. Despite Musk’s optimistic talk about the Model Y’s sales prospects, Tesla’s brand crisis appears to be deepening. And it’s not because European consumers are souring on electric vehicles; in the first four months of 2025, new battery-electric car sales grew by 26.4 percent, to 558,262 units, capturing 15.3 percent of the total EU market share. Despite Musk’s optimistic talk about the Model Y’s sales prospects, Tesla’s brand crisis appears to be deepening. Tesla’s falling fortunes can be chalked up to several factors, including rising competition from domestic manufacturers and Chinese rivals, and Musk’s efforts to slash federal spending for the Trump administration as part of DOGE, or the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk’s political meddling in the EU, where he came out insupport of Germany’s far-right partyahead of that country’s elections, appears to have done Tesla few favors as well. Musk seems to be aware that his political activities are having an adverse effect on Tesla. He recently claimedhe would spend less timein Washington and focus more on his company —although he also saidhe would stay involved in Trump’s White House through the end of the president’s term in office. But while Republicans were once thrilled by Musk’s allegiance to Trump, the country as a whole is sick of his antics.A recent Reuters/Ipsos pollfound that 58 percent of respondents had an unfavorable view of Musk, compared to 39 percent who viewed him favorably. And it would seem like the strategy of tying Musk closely to his companies’ brands has backfired.A survey gauging the reputations of top companiesranked Tesla 95th and SpaceX 86th, down from the 8th highest rated brand and 5th highest four years ago, respectively. During last month’s quarterly earnings call, Musk confidently told investors that Tesla’s sales would pick back up after factory closures for the refreshed Model Y was all settled. But with the CEO so focused on AI, robotics, and self-driving cars, it’s not clear that there’s any immediate fix to Tesla’s compounding problems.

In 2022, Payton Gendron drove several hours to the Tops supermarket in Buffalo, New York, where he opened fire on shoppers, killing 10 people and injuring three others. Gendron claimed to have been inspired by previous racially motivated attacks. He livestreamed the attack on Twitch and, in a lengthy manifesto and a private diary he kept on Discord, said he had been radicalized in part by racist memes and intentionally targeted a majority-Black community. Everytown for Gun Safetybrought multiple lawsuitsover the shooting in 2023, filing claims against gun sellers, Gendron’s parents, and a long list of web platforms. The accusations against different companies vary, but all place some responsibility for Gendron’s radicalization at the heart of the dispute. The platforms are relying onSection 230 of the Communications Decency Actto defend themselves against a somewhat complicated argument. In the US,postingwhite supremacist content is typically protected by the First Amendment. But these lawsuits argue that if a platform feeds it nonstop to users in an attempt to keep them hooked, it becomes a sign of a defective product — and, by extension, breaks product liability laws if that leads to harm. That strategy requires arguing that companies are shaping user content in ways that shouldn’t receive protection under Section 230, which prevents interactive computer services from being held liable for what users post, and that their services are products that fit under the liability law. “This is not a lawsuit against publishers,” John Elmore, an attorney for the plaintiffs, told the judges. “Publishers copyright their material. Companies that manufacture productspatenttheir materials, and every single one of these defendants has a patent.” These patented products, Elmore continued, are “dangerous and unsafe” and are therefore “defective” under New York’s product liability law, which lets consumers seek compensation for injuries. Some of the tech defendants — including Discord and 4chan — don’t have proprietary recommendation algorithms tailored to individual users, but the claims against them allege that their designs still aim to hook users in a way that predictably encouraged harm. “This community was traumatized by a juvenile white supremacist who was fueled with hate — radicalized by social media platforms on the internet,” Elmore said. “He obtained his hatred for people who he never met, people who never did anything to his family or anything against him, based upon algorithm-driven videos, writings, and groups that he associated with and was introduced to on these platforms that we’re suing.” These platforms, Elmore continued, own “patented products” that “forced” Gendron to commit a mass shooting. In his manifesto, Gendron called himself an “eco-fascist national socialist” and said he had been inspired byprevious mass shootings in Christchurch, New Zealand, andEl Paso, Texas. Like his predecessors, Gendron wrote that he was concerned about “white genocide” and thegreat replacement: a conspiracy theory alleging that there is a global plot to replace white Americans and Europeans with people of color, typically through mass immigration. Gendronpleaded guiltyto state murder and terrorism charges in 2022 and is currently serving life in prison. According to areportby the New York attorney general’s office, which was cited by the plaintiff’s lawyers, Gendron “peppered his manifesto with memes, in-jokes, and slang common on extremist websites and message boards,” a pattern found in some other mass shootings. Gendron encouraged readers to follow in his footsteps, and urged extremists to spread their message online, writing that memes “have done more for the ethno-nationalist movement than any manifesto.” Citing Gendron’s manifesto, Elmore told judges that before Gendron was “force-fed online white supremacist materials,” Gendron never had any problems with or animosity toward Black people. “He was encouraged by the notoriety that the algorithms brought to other mass shooters that were streamed online, and then he went down a rabbit hole.” Everytown for Gun Safetysued nearly a dozen companies— including Meta, Reddit, Amazon, Google, YouTube, Discord, and 4chan — over their alleged role in the shooting in 2023. Last year, a federal judgeallowed the suits to proceed. The racist memes Gendron was seeing online are undoubtedly a major part of the complaint, but the plaintiffs aren’t arguing that it’s illegal to show someone racist, white supremacist, or violent content. In fact, the September 2023 complaint explicitly notes that the plaintiffs aren’t seeking to hold YouTube “liable as the publisher or speaker of content posted by third parties,” partly because that would give YouTube ammunition to get the suit dismissed on Section 230 grounds. Instead, they’re suing YouTube as the “designers and marketers of a social media product … that was not reasonably safe and that was reasonably dangerous for its intended use.” Their argument is that YouTube and other social media website algorithms’ addictive nature, when coupled with their willingness to host white supremacist content, makes them unsafe. “A safer design exists,” the complaint states, but YouTube and other social media platforms “have failed to modify their product to make it less dangerous because they seek to maximize user engagement and profits.” The plaintiffs made similar complaints about other platforms. Twitch, which doesn’t rely on algorithmic generations, could alter its product so the videos are on a time delay, Amy Keller, an attorney for the plaintiffs, told judges. Reddit’s upvoting and karma features create a “feedback loop” that encourages use. 4chan doesn’t require users to register accounts, allowing them to post extremist content anonymously. “There are specific types of defective designs that we talk about with each of these defendants,” Keller said, adding that platforms that have algorithmic recommendation systems are “probably at the top of the heap when it comes to liability.” During the hearing, the judges asked the plaintiffs’ attorneys if these algorithms are always harmful. “I like cat videos, and I watch cat videos; they keep sending me cat videos,” one of the judges said. “There’s a beneficial purpose, is there not? There’s some thought that without algorithms, some of these platforms can’t work. There’s just too much information.” After agreeing that he loves cat videos, Glenn Chappell, another attorney for the plaintiffs, said the issue lies with algorithms “designed to foster addiction and the harms resulting from that type of addictive mechanism are known.” In those instances, Chappell said, “Section 230 does not apply.” The issue was “the fact that the algorithm itself made the content addictive,” Keller said. The platforms’ lawyers, meanwhile, argued that sorting content in a particular way shouldn’t strip them of protections against liability for user-posted content. While the complaint may argue it’s not saying web services are publishers or speakers, the platforms’ defense counters that thisisstill a case about speech where Section 230 applies. “Case after case has recognized that there’s no algorithms exception to the application of Section 230,” Eric Shumsky, an attorney for Meta, told judges. The Supreme Court considered whether Section 230 protections applied to algorithmically recommended content inGonzalez v. Google, but in 2023, itdismissed the casewithout reaching a conclusion or redefining the currently expansive protections. Shumsky contended that algorithms’ personalized nature prevents them from being “products” under the law. “Services are not products because they are not standardized,” Shumsky said. Unlike cars or lawnmowers, “these services are used and experienced differently by every user,” since platforms “tailor the experiences based on the user’s actions.” In other words, algorithms may have influenced Gendron, but Gendron’s beliefs also influenced the algorithms. Section 230 is a common counter to claims that social media companies should be liable for how they run their apps and websites, and one that’s sometimes succeeded. A 2023 court ruling found that Instagram, for instance, wasn’t liable fordesigning its service in a waythat allowed users to transmit harmful speech. The accusations “inescapably return to the ultimate conclusion that Instagram, by some flaw of design, allows users to post content that can be harmful to others,” the ruling said. Last year, however, a federal appeals court ruled that TikTok had to face a lawsuit over a viral “blackout challenge” that some parents claimed led to their children’s deaths. In that case,Anderson v. TikTok,the Third Circuit court of appeals determined that TikTok couldn’t claim Section 230 immunity, since its algorithms fed users the viral challenge. The court ruled that the content TikTok recommends to its users isn’t third-party speech generated by other users; it’sfirst-partyspeech, because users see it as a result of TikTok’s proprietary algorithm. The Third Circuit’s ruling is anomalous, so much so that Section 230 expert Eric Goldmancalled it “bonkers.”But there’s a concerted push to limit the law’s protections. Conservative legislators want torepeal Section 230, and a growing number of courts will need to decide whether users of social networks are being sold a dangerous bill of goods — not simply a conduit for their speech.

    "article_text": "But only in Japan. But only in Japan. byAsh Parrish It is as inevitable as a sunrise that in the hours after the Switch 2 launch next week, third-party sites like eBay will be filled with listings for the new console. But in Japan, Nintendo hasannounced a new partnershipwith Japanese third-party retail sites to combat fraudulent Switch 2 listings. Mercari, Yahoo Auctions and Yahoo Flea Market, and Rakuten Rakuma are the participating websites that will, according to a machine translation of Nintendo’s announcement, “proactively remove listings” and establish “a collaborative system for sharing information.” Nintendo says only “fraudulent listings” that violated the sites’ terms of service agreement would be targeted for removal. Ina translated statement on Yahoo Japan’s website, the retailer stated that there will be a probationary period for the Switch 2 starting June 5th in which Yahoo Japan will remove listings for the console or suspend the accounts selling them. According to Yahoo Japan, it will revise the probationary period as necessary. Scalpers are the bane of any console launch.Bots flood online buying queuesto snap up units before real humans can click “Add to cart.” Bot users then take advantage of consumer FOMO by listing consoles for exorbitant prices. Meanwhile, other sellers use deception to trick people into buying what they think is a console but is actuallya picture of a boxor some other worthless item. (Anti-scalpers would later usea version of this practicefor the Switch 2.) Hopefully, Nintendo’s plan with third-party sites in Japan works well enough to expand it to other regions. To cut down on scalpers during the Switch 2 preorder window, Nintendo sent out preorder invitations to users with over50 hours of gameplay and a Nintendo Switch Online subscription.

    "title": "Trump administration asks Supreme Court to lift limits on deportations to 'third countries'",
    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Tuesday to make it easier for officials to deport convicted criminals to \"third countries\" that are not their countries of origin. The administration is seeking to block an injunction in which Massachusetts-based U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy said the affected immigrants nationwide should be given a \"meaningful opportunity\" to raise concerns that they may be at risk of torture, persecution or death. Murphy later clarified that they should have at least 10 days to bring their claims. Just last week, he said the administration hadviolated his previous orderby flying eight migrants to South Sudan. The men are now being held in a U.S. facility in Djibouti. All the immigrants potentially affected by the litigation are already subject to deportation but cannot be sent to their countries of origin, so the case hinges on what legal process they receive before they can be deported. Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in the new filing that Murphy's rulings require the government to undertake \"an onerous set of procedures\" that he had no authority to require. \"Those judicially created procedures are currently wreaking havoc on the third-country removal process. In addition to usurping the Executive’s authority over immigration policy, the injunction disrupts sensitive diplomatic, foreign-policy, and national-security efforts,\" Sauer wrote. Trina Realmuto, a lawyer at the National Immigration Litigation Alliance who represents the plaintiffs, said in a statement that Murphy \"took limited and appropriate actions to ensure that people are afforded due process protections before the government can deport them to third countries.\" Murphy's original order in April concluded that plaintiffs were merely asking for basic due process. \"Plaintiffs are simply asking to be told they are going to be deported to a new country before they are taken to such a country, and be given an opportunity to explain why such a deportation will likely result in their persecution, torture, and/or death,\" he wrote. On Monday night, Murphy rejected a government attempt to reconsider his requirements as it relates to the men now in South Sudan. “It turns out that having immigration proceedings on another continent is harder and more logistically cumbersome than Defendants anticipated,\" he wrote. “It continues to be this Court’s sincere hope that reason can get the better of rhetoric,\" he added.",

    "article_text": "The Trump administration on Tuesday stopped scheduling new interviews for international students seeking visas to study in the United States as the State Department prepares for expanded social media screening of applicants, according to an internal cable seen by NBC News. The directive was widely circulated to all U.S. diplomatic and consular posts abroad and signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio.Politico first reported the cable. The move is the Trump administration’s latest strike on higher education in general and international students in particular as it cuts financial support to Harvard and arrests visa-holding students from abroad. The State Department said it would issue further guidance to consulates and embassies in the coming days. “Effective immediately, in preparation for an expansion of required social media screening and vetting, consular sections should not add any additional student or exchange visitor visa appointment capacity,\" the cable said. The memo also warned of “potentially significant implications for consular section operations, processes, and resource allocations” in a clear indication of the delay likely for student visa applications. “Consular sections will need to take into consideration the workload and resource requirements of each case prior to scheduling them going forward,” the cable said, adding the priority should be on “services for U.S. citizens, immigrant visas, and fraud prevention.” It was unclear how the prospective students’ social media would be screened as part of the expanded vetting procedures. The public views and speech of international students have come under increased scrutiny during the Trump administration. The visas of thousands of students at college campuses nationwide have been revoked in recent weeks by the Trump administration, which says it must protect U.S. citizens from immigrants who intend to commit terrorist attacks, threaten national security or espouse hateful ideology. The future of foreign students at Harvard remains uncertain after the Trump administrationbanned their enrollmentstarting in the next school year. “International students are not a threat.”said Fanta Aw, CEO of the Association of International Educators, adding that they comprise less than 6% of college enrollment in the United States. \"Today’s decision will have a significant impact on international student’s ability to arrive in the U.S. in time for their studies, if they aren’t already discouraged and choose to attend in another country,\" Aw said. Many universities nationwidehave warned international students about traveling abroad this summer, fearing many will not be allowed to return. The crackdown could also financially affect other universities with significant numbers of foreign students. The State Department had already instructed U.S. diplomats and consular officers to refer certain student and exchange visitor visa applicants to its fraud prevention unit for mandatory social media checks under two executive orders known as Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats and Additional Measures to Combat Anti-Semitism.",

    "title": "Marine says he tackled man accused of trying to open exit door midflight",
    "article_text": "Jody Armentrout was sitting at an exit row seat on Saturday'sAll Nippon Airways Flight 114traveling from Tokyo to Houston when he noticed a man was acting strangely. Armentrout, a sergeant major who has served in the Marines for over 20 years and is based in Japan, has been trained to be vigilant. He said he saw the man take his backpack to one of the bathrooms, then come out and go to another bathroom and then, another bathroom. \"He came out of that one and began pacing up and down the aisle, so that just threw my radar on,\" Armentrout, 50, said in a phone interview. But then, Armentrout said, he saw the man eyeing up the emergency exit right next to him. Armentrout said he stood up, putting himself between the man and the exit door. That's when the man turned around, ran through the plane's galley and darted to the exit door on the opposite side, Armentrout said. He knew he had seconds to act. \"He grabbed a strap around the door, pulled it off, and about that time is when I took him and slammed him, put him on the ground,\" Armentrout said. \"And then there was an older gentleman sitting on that side that woke up, and he got up and kind of helped me.\" Armentrout said flight attendants handed him zip ties, which he placed around the man's wrists and used to secure him to a seat. It was announced that the plane would be diverted to Seattle as a result of the incident, and Armentrout said he sat next to the man until they landed at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. \"His eyes — you could definitely tell there was something going on,\" Armentrout said. All Nippon Airways Flight 114 departed from Haneda Airport on Saturday morning and was heading to Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport when a passenger became “unruly,” the airline said. Port of Seattle police told NBC News that the passenger was trying to open exit doors during the flight. Police confirmed that passengers and flight crew members restrained the man, who has not been identified. The flight landed at Seattle at 4:19 a.m. PT, and the man was taken off the plane, police said.He was evaluated, and it was determined he was “having a medical crisis,\" police said. The man was later taken to a local hospital. Armentrout said he acted out of concern for his fellow passengers, especially multiple babies. \"I just knew he was up to something crazy, and at the end of the day, I was willing to take the risk of him saying 'I'm not doing anything' and then just them making him go sit back down than me allowing him to do anything that's going to put anybody at risk,\" Armentrout said. Other passengers took the time to thank Armentrout for acting when he did, he said. But the eventfulness of the flight did not stop there. Once they were on the tarmac in Seattle, another passenger who \"was frustrated at the flight diversion\" punched a bathroom door, according to the FBI's Seattle field office. That person, who has not been identified, was removed from the flight, which eventually landed in Houston at 12:42 p.m. CT, according to FlightAware.com. No charges had been filed for either people as of Tuesday, according to the FBI. After having finally arrived in Houston, Armentrout said he was glad his feet were on the ground. \"It was a weird flight,\" he said, adding that he will return to Japan on Friday and is feeling a little anxious about the journey. Keeping in mind what happened, Armentrout wants others to stay aware of their surroundings. \"I want to make sure everybody understands what time we are in in this world nowadays and that they need to be aware of their surroundings all the time,\" he said.",

    "title": "Abortions halted again in Missouri after state Supreme Court ruling",
    "article_text": "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. — Planned Parenthood halted abortions in Missouri on Tuesday after the state's top court ordered new rulings in the tumultuous legal saga over a ban that voters struck down last November. The state's top court ruled that a district judge applied the wrong standard in rulings in December and February that allowed abortions to resume in the state. Nearly all abortions were halted under a ban that took effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. In Tuesday's two-page ruling, the court ordered Judge Jerri Zhang to vacate her earlier orders and reevaluate the case using the standards the court laid out. Zhang ruled that she was allowing abortions to resume largely because advocates were likely to prevail in the case eventually. The Supreme Court said it should first consider whether there would be harms from allowing abortions to resume. The state emphasized in its petition filed to the state Supreme Court in March that Planned Parenthood didn't sufficiently prove women were harmed without the temporary blocks on the broad swath of laws and regulations on abortion services and providers. On the contrary, the state said Zhang's decisions left abortion facilities \"functionally unregulated\" and women with \"no guarantee of health and safety.\" Among the regulations that had been placed on hold were ones setting cleanliness standards for abortion facilities and requiring physicians who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at certain types of hospitals located within 30 miles (48 kilometers) or 15 minutes of where an abortion is provided. Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey said in a statement that \"today's decision from the Missouri Supreme Court is a win for women and children and sends a clear message — abortion providers must comply with state law regarding basic safety and sanitation requirements.\" Planned Parenthood maintains that those restrictions were specifically targeted to make it harder to access abortion. Still, the organization — which has the state's only abortion clinics — immediately started calling patients to cancel abortion appointments at Missouri clinics in Columbia and Kansas City, according to Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains. Wales said it's a familiar but disappointing position for the organization. \"We have had to call patients in Missouri previously and say you were scheduled for care, your appointment is now canceled because of political interference, new restrictions, licensure overreach by the state,\" she said. \"To be in that position again, after the people of Missouri voted to ensure abortion access, is frustrating.\" Wales said Planned Parenthood hopes to be back in court soon. Sam Lee, director of Campaign Life Missouri, said he was \"extremely excited\" by the Supreme Court order. \"This means that our pro-life laws, which include many health and safety protections for women, will remain in place,\" Lee said. \"How long they will remain we will have to see.\"",

    "title": "Trump to pardon reality TV couple convicted of fraud, tax evasion",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump called two of the children of imprisoned reality television couple Todd and Julie Chrisley from the Oval Office on Tuesday, informing them of his plans to pardon their parents as soon as Wednesday. The pair, known for their roles on the TV show “Chrisley Knows Best,” sought pardons from Trump in February after they were convicted of bilking banks out of tens of millions of dollars in 2022,NBC News reported. A judge had handed down sentences of12 yearsfor Todd Chrisley and seven years for his wife, Julie Chrisley, in November 2022 after an Atlanta juryfound them guiltyof fraud, tax evasion and conspiracy to defraud the United States following a weekslong federal trial. A White House official told NBC News that Trump will sign the pardons once they are ready — most likely within 24 hours. Trump told two of their children, Savannah and Grayson Chrisley, in a phone call that he planned to pardon the couple. \"It’s a terrible thing, but it’s a great thing because your parents are going to be free and clean,\" Trump said on the call. \"We’ll try getting it done tomorrow, so give them — I don’t know them — but give them my regards and wish them well. Wish them a good life.\" Grayson Chrisley responded, \"Mr. President, I just want to say thank you for bringing my parents back.\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in a statement that Trump is \"always pleased to give well-deserving Americans a second chance, especially those who have been unfairly targeted and overly prosecuted by an unjust justice system.\" \"President Trump called Savannah and her brother from the Oval Office to personally inform them that he would be pardoning their parents, Todd and Julie Chrisley, whose sentences were far too harsh,\" Fields said. Prosecutorssaid Todd and Julie Chrisley conspired to defraudAtlanta-area banks of more than $36 million in personal loans by submitting false bank statements and other records, which they spent on luxury cars and travel. They later defrauded the IRS, evading collection of $500,000 in taxes owed by Todd Chrisley, prosecutors alleged, while raking in millions of dollars from their TV show. The Chrisleys were also alleged to have failed to file tax returns or pay any taxes for tax years 2013 through 2016. Trump said Monday he had granted Scott Jenkins, a former Virginia sheriff, a pardon. Jenkins wassentenced in Marchto 10 years in prison for accepting over $75,000 in bribes in return for appointing a series of Virginia businessmen as auxiliary deputy sheriffs in his department. Trump said Jenkins, a former sheriff of Culpeper County, and his family had \"been dragged through HELL by a Corrupt and Weaponized\" Justice Department during the Biden administration, an accusation that has underpinned many of his calls for clemency since he returned to the White House. Trump hasextended pardonsand commutations to thousands of people since he began his second term, including roughly1,500 criminal defendantswho were involved in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.",

    "article_text": "Guitarist and singer Rick Derringer, who shot to fame at 17 when his band The McCoys recorded \"Hang On Sloopy,\" had a hit with \"Rock and Roll, Hoochie Koo\" and earned a Grammy Award for producing \"Weird Al \" Yankovic's debut album, has died. He was 77. Derringer died Monday in Ormond Beach, Florida, according to a Facebook announcement from his caregiver, Tony Wilson. No cause of death was announced. Derringer's decades in the music industry spanned teen stardom, session work for bands like Steely Dan, supplying the guitar solo on Bonnie Tyler's \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" and producing for Cyndi Lauper. \"Derringer's legacy extends beyond his music, entertaining fans with his signature energy and talent. His passing leaves a void in the music world, and he will be deeply missed by fans, colleagues, and loved ones,\" Wilson wrote. As a teen, he formed the McCoys with his brother, Randy, and found fame singing \"Hang On Sloopy,\" a No. 26 hit about lovers from different socioeconomic circumstances. Derringer enjoyed his first solo hit with \"Rock and Roll, Hoochie Koo,\" which was used in the fourth season of \"Stranger Things.\" His best-charting album was \"All American Boy\" in 1973, which included the instrumentals \"Joy Ride\" and \"Time Warp.\" His sole Grammy was for Yankovic's \"Eat It,\" which had the Michael Jackson parodies \"Eat It\" and \"Who's Fat.\" Throughout the 1970s and '80s, Derringer worked extensively as a session musician, playing on albums by Steely Dan — including \"Countdown to Ecstasy,\" \"Katy Lied\" and \"Gaucho\" — Todd Rundgren, Kiss and Barbra Streisand. He played on Air Supply's \"Making Love Out of Nothing at All.\" In the mid-1980s he began working with Lauper, touring in her band and playing on three of her albums, including the hit \"True Colors.\" He toured with Ringo Starr and The All-Starr Band. In 1985, he produced the World Wrestling Federation's \"The Wrestling Album,\" which consisted mostly of pro wrestlers' theme songs, many of which he co-wrote, including what would become Hulk Hogan's theme song \"Real American.\"",

    "article_text": "U.S. government prosecutors returned from the holiday weekend andpressed forwardin their racketeering conspiracy and sex traffickingcase against Diddytoday. They called to the witness stand a former employee of the rapper who portrayed him as a ruthless and volatile kingpin bent on controlling the people around him with violence and threats. The highlights: Clark painted an emotionally wrenching and at times disturbing picture of her tenure as one of Diddy’s employees. In riveting detail, she recounted the sense of danger and fear she felt, portraying her former boss as an erratic and menacing figure who was prone to violence. She repeatedly broke down in tears, including as she recalled Diddy lunging at her and shoving her at his Miami home nearly 20 years ago. She gestured with her hands to show jurors how he allegedly pushed her. The incident was “crossing my boundary,” Clark said through tears. She sobbed again during defense lawyerMarc Agnifilo’s cross-examination, acknowledging she worked hard for Diddy because he was “tenacious,” broke glass ceilings and “matched wits” with people. Clark worked for him in two different stints, most recently from 2016 to 2018. Clark at one point apologized toJudge Arun Subramanianfor crying. You don’t have to apologize, he replied. Diddy, wearing a blue sweater, seemed fully engaged during Clark’s testimony, leaning forward in his seat and frequently passing notes to his lawyers. He stared intently at Clark nearly the entire time she answered questions. In other news:Maurene Comey, the lead prosecutor, told Subramanian that the government’s case is moving ahead of schedule. She predicted the prosecution would rest after five weeks — rather than six, as originally planned. Tomorrow: Prosecutors are expected to call members of the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles Fire Department.

    "title": "As supplement use grows in the U.S., so are rates of toxic hepatitis",
    "article_text": "It started with nausea and loss of appetite. Robert Grafton, of Turnersville, New Jersey, tried to convince himself he was just coming down with something one weekend in mid-March. Then came the itching and dark urine. Grafton, a former interventional radiology technologist whose wife is a nurse, recognized thehallmarks of liver failure. The otherwise healthy 54-year-old had a gut feeling that hisherbal and dietary supplementswere the culprit. “I stopped taking everything, thank goodness,” Grafton said. “If I hadn’t known, if I was not in the medical field, I might have thought, ‘Oh, I think I’m getting sick. I need to take some more of these supplements to help me feel better.’” When his symptoms had only worsened by midweek, Grafton visited his primary care physician. The doctor, he said, suspectedhepatitis A, a liver infection that can be caused by consuming food or drink contaminated with the hepatitis A virus. Grafton’s laboratory test results showed otherwise. “My liver enzymes were super elevated, mybilirubin was really high— all the signs of liver failure,” Grafton said. “I pretty much broke down, my wife as well. I was, at that point, thinking it was liver cancer, pancreatic cancer or something.” That Friday, less than a week after his symptoms had begun, Grafton was admitted to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia, where he received a diagnosis. “It turns out I had something called adrug-induced liver injury, which came from my supplements.” The liver is responsible for more than 500 functions in the human body, including filtering harmful substances from the blood. Some people’s livers metabolize toxins more slowly than others, but too much of certain drugs can overwhelm even the healthiest liver. When taken in excess, acetaminophen, for example, the active ingredient in Tylenol, isamong the most common causes of drug-induced liver injury, also called toxic hepatitis. Pharmaceutical products aren’t solely the cause.Herbal and dietary supplementsare causing liver damage with mounting prevalence. From 1995 through 2020, supplement-related liver failure requiring U.S. patients to be waitlisted for transplants increased eightfold, according to a 2022 study in the journalLiver Transplantation. In addition, a 2017 review in the journalHepatologyfound that 20% of liver toxicity cases nationwide are tied to herbal and dietary supplements. Because “multi-ingredient nutritional supplements” caused the majority of those cases, the authors said, it’s hard to pinpoint which component(s) may be to blame. Whereas dietary supplements typically containnutrients such as vitamins, minerals and amino acidsfrom a range of sources such as fish oil, herbal supplements are a subset of dietary supplements composed ofplant-based ingredients. Liver damage linked to supplements is rare. How rare is unclear. What is known is why cases are on the rise: More Americans are taking supplements. As many as 3 in 4 adults 18 and older take them, according to a 2024 survey by theCouncil for Responsible Nutrition, a trade group representing the dietary supplement and functional food industry. Almost 4 in 5 users said they prefer supplements to prescription or over-the-counter medications. By comparison, the2017–2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveyshowed that 58% of adults 20 and older had used a dietary supplement in the past 30 days. “I think people assume these things are safe,” said Dr. Dina Halegoua-De Marzio, a Jefferson Health hepatologist who treated Grafton. “The No. 1 reason we see people taking these are for good health or to supplement their health, and so I don’t think that they realize that there is a real risk here.” Grafton was one such consumer. The father of five became more health-conscious when he hit 50, going to the gym and starting a supplement regimen that includedfenugreek,DHEA,ashwagandha,L-carnitineandnitric oxide. He continued that cocktail, with few changes, for years without incident. About a month before he got sick, Grafton addedturmericpills to the mix, with the goal of reducing inflammation. Then Grafton saw the social media promo he said helped set his health crisis in motion. Ironically, he bought an advertised turmeric-based liquid supplement in part because it claims to support long-term liver health. Similar products are widely available. “The whole push with that is that you’re getting a super-high, concentrated dose of turmeric anddandelion rootandmilk thistle, which I have always known from my medical past is good for liver health,” Grafton said. “It all sounded good. … I thought I did enough digging.” He fell ill within a week of adding the liquid supplement to his routine. Even though Grafton stopped the turmeric pills the day he started the turmeric drink, Halegoua-De Marzio said, turmeric overload most likely caused his liver injury. Not only was the drink ultra-concentrated; the pills contained 2,250 mg ofcurcumin, a substance that comes from the root of the turmeric plant. The pills also include black pepper extract, which Halegoua-De Marzio warned increases absorption twentyfold. “When you cook with turmeric, that could be really safe. But some of the supplements now are 2,000 mg plus, which is a very high dose of turmeric,” she said. Coupled with black pepper, “the liver now has to break down that supplement and it can’t. It could make it really sick.” The supplement spectrum includes everything from powders that claim to promote muscle growth to gummies that promise to reduce stress. When it comes to herbal supplements, natural doesn’t necessarily mean better or safer, Halegoua-De Marzio said. “That’s what I hear from patients all the time — ‘Oh, I want something natural’ — this fear of prescription medicines being unsafe,” she said, adding that while prescriptions bear their own risks, they’ve gone through rigorous clinical trials. Supplements aren’t subjected to the same premarket testing. Among herbal ingredients tied to toxic hepatitis, turmeric is the most commonly consumed in the U.S., according to a study published last year in the journalJAMA Network Open. Following that aregreen tea extract, ashwagandha,Garcinia cambogia,red yeast riceandblack cohosh. About 15.6 million Americans take supplements containing at least one of these six botanicals, the study found. Most reported doing so on their own, not under a doctor’s advice. Prescription medications are tightly regulated and therefore more easily quantified; it’s difficult to determine how many people consume supplements whose ingredients can cause liver damage. A goal of the JAMA Network Open research was to capture this magnitude — at least whereherbal supplementsare concerned — said co-author Dr. Robert Fontana, a professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan Medical School. “It’s important for other doctors to know, for the general public to know,” Fontana said. “The denominator of use is going up.” Fontana and Halegoua-De Marzio are part of theDrug-Induced Liver Injury Network, a research group backed by theNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health. More than 1,800 patients have been enrolled since the program’s 2004 inception, with19% of cases tied to supplements. Previous researchhas estimated that the U.S. sees 44,000 cases of liver damage linked to medications and supplements annually, including 2,700 deaths. The actual incidence is likely higher, Fontana said. Liver failure symptoms can be vague, so some people may be unaware they have the condition. People who sought natural remedies in the form of supplements may be wary of seeing a doctor. Others, Fontana said, may be embarrassed about inadvertently harming themselves; botanical users in his 2024 research were older, wealthier and more educated than nonusers. “When you’re the patient, you’re like, ‘Why did this happen to me?’” Fontana said. “‘What do you mean, this stuff isn’t safe?’” For Joanne Slavin, a registered dietitian and professor in the department of food science and nutrition at the University of Minnesota, consumer education on the risks and rewards of supplements is critical. “We really only know human data when something goes wrong,” she said. The Food and Drug Administration maintains a searchable database ofrecalls, market withdrawals and safety alertsbut can’t vet supplements forsafety or effectivenessbefore they hit store shelves. Only once they’re on the market does the agency have the authority to penalize“adulterated or misbranded” products. That’s thanks to theDietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, which limited the FDA’s reach. The number of supplements on sale today is almost 20 times as many as three decades ago. Consuming supplements comes with risks, the FDA warns. “Dietary supplements may contain ingredients that can have strong effects in the body, even if the ingredients are natural or plant-derived,” the agency said in a statement to NBC News. “Adverse events are more likely to occur if consumers take supplements in high doses, take multiple supplements or take supplements instead of or in addition to medications.” According to the Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN), dietary supplements can’t make claims concerning the prevention, diagnosis, mitigation or curing of a disease. “Dietary supplements can’t say they can cure your cold, they can’t say they canprevent your Alzheimer’sor your cancer,” CRN President and CEO Steve Mister said. “If you see (such) a product out there, it is blatantly illegal.” In short, he said, supplements are intended for healthy people who are trying to stay healthy. While everyone should ideally get all nutrients through a balanced diet, Slavin said, she recognizes that dietary supplements have their place. People who don’t eat red meat, for instance, may need to seek an alternate source of iron. “A supplement is fine, sure,” she said. “But that’s on the individual basis rather than the public health basis for the whole world.” Monitoring how many vitamins or mineral supplements are taken daily is straightforward, Slavin said. The federalOffice of Dietary Supplementshas established daily upper limits for nutrients, fromvitamin Atozinc, which vary by age and sex.Calcium, for example, has an upper limit of 2,000 mg per day for adults 51 and older — including food, drink and supplements. Herbal supplements have no such boundaries andaren’t as well studied. “Everything can be toxic at a certain amount,” said Andrea Wong, CRN senior vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs. “It’s really up to the manufacturers and the researchers who are looking at these ingredients to determine what is the beneficial amount … then also look at what would be the amount where you start seeing some evidence of toxicity.” She said it’s important to let your doctor know about any supplements you’re taking or starting. Some supplements mayinterfere with prescription medications or each other, or be unsafe for people with certain medical conditions. For example, the FDA advises against taking any combination ofaspirin,vitamin E, prescriptionwarfarinor herbal supplementginkgo biloba— all are blood thinners and may increase risk of stroke or internal bleeding. According to Fontana, some people are evengenetically susceptibleto supplement-induced liver damage. “That means there’s a biological basis as to why they were the one in 1,000, one in 10,000 people who took this and got into trouble,” Fontana said of supplements. “The same thing is true for prescription drugs; we’re finding genetic associations.” Thefederal LiverTox databaseis a free tool highlighting medicines and supplements linked to liver injury. The liver is usually a forgiving organ, Fontana said. Grafton’s was. His hospital stay was brief, and he said his blood work had returned to normal within weeks of ceasing supplements. Additional testing revealed no permanent damage to his liver. He said he has a new lease on life and resumed his health kick — with one notable exception. “I don’t take any supplements whatsoever.”",

    "article_text": "A small Arkansas town is on edge after aformer police chief convicted of fatally shooting a man and sexually assaulting an elementary school teacher escaped from prisonSunday wearing a \"makeshift\" law enforcement uniform. Residents of Garfield expressed fear and anger as the search for Grant Hardin entered its third day. \"This whole weekend, I’ve kept the house locked,\" Brenda Fields, 60, said in a phone interview Tuesday. \"He was in law enforcement, so he’s not just your average person. That makes me more nervous because he had that background.\" Rex Littrell lives up the street from Hardin’s parents in Garfield, a town of about 600 people in northwest Arkansas, about 40 miles northeast of Fayetteville and not far from the Missouri border. He said that because of the nature of the crimes, Hardin should have been under careful watch. \"He should never have had a chance to escape. He’s killed somebody and he’s raped somebody,\" he said. Fields, who lives across the street from Hardin's parents, said she learned about his escape on Facebook. \"My dad lives right next to us, too, and he’s locked all of his stuff up, locked up the outbuildings,\" she added, saying she's \"scared.\" \"I wish they’d hurry up and find him.\" Hardin, the former police chief in the neighboring town of Gateway, has been on the run since Sunday afternoon after he escaped from the North Central Unit in Calico Rock, which is about 140 miles east of Garfield. He was convicted of killing Gateway City water employee James Appleton in 2017 and raping teacher Amy Harrison in 1997 —cases featured in the Max documentary \"Devil in the Ozarks.\" He was Gateway's police chief for about four months in early 2016. He also held jobs as an officer, a county constable and a corrections officer, NBC affiliate KNWA of Fayetteville reported. The Stone County Sheriff’s Officesaid he escapedthrough a sally port, a controlled entry or exit area at the facility. He was wearing a \"makeshift outfit designed to mimic law enforcement,\" officials have said. A photo released by the sheriff's office showed Hardin dressed in all black, appearing to push a wheeled cart with wooden pallets on it. Law enforcement agencies from across the state have joined the search. He remained at large Tuesday afternoon, and the state Corrections Department had no new updates. The Izard County Sheriff’s Office warned residents to keep their doors locked and stay inside, county officials said. The lack of information about Hardin's whereabouts is frustrating for Cheryl Tillman, the mayor of Gateway and sister of Appleton. \"It brings back a lot of memories of when it first happened,\" she said. \"I can’t believe this has happened. I mean, what were they doing down at the prison that this happened?\" Tillman said law enforcement has not reached out to her family about Hardin's escape. She learned the news Sunday from an automated phone call from a jail messaging system. \"All it said was that Grant Hardin had escaped from prison,\" she recalled. \"Nobody’s been in contact with us. ... I find it pretty sad that authorities have not reached out to us.\" She said people in the community \"are a little scared.\" Tillman has taken extra precautions by having someone with her when she goes to work. \"You just have to stay vigilant and watch your surroundings,\" she said. \"That’s what I do.\" Hardin was serving a 30-year sentence for Appleton's murder and a 50-year sentence for the sexual assault of Harrison when he escaped. Appleton was talking to his brother-in-law when he was shot in his car Feb. 23, 2017, according to an affidavit filed in the case. The following year, a DNA sample linked him to the cold case rape of Harrison at Frank Tillery Elementary School. Hardin pleaded guilty in both cases. Harrison declined to comment Tuesday. Fields said Appleton was always a \"really nice guy.\" \"He used to come to our house once a month to read the water meter,\" she said. Littrell said there was \"no reason for James to have died.\" \"There was no reason for what happened to James to have happened. It was just bloody murder,\" he said, calling Appleton a \"good guy.\" Tillman said that the family has struggled to move on over the years and that Hardin's escape adds to their pain. \"I wouldn’t say the first couple of years were easy. They were pretty hard,\" she said. \"Then you try and go on, and things subsided, and then 'wham,' all this comes back up again. It’s very hard.\"",

    "article_text": "Welcome to the online version ofFrom the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail. Happy Tuesday and welcome back from the long weekend. In today’s edition, we explore how Barack Obama’s political orbit is losing some of its clout. Plus, Steve Kornacki breaks down where New Jersey’s traditionally powerful Democratic county parties stand in the state’s crowded gubernatorial primary. Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. — Adam Wollner Have a question for the NBC News Politics Desk about Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill” as it makes its way through Congress, next month’s elections in New Jersey, or anything else happening in the world of politics? Send your questions topoliticsnewsletter@nbcuni.comand we may answer them in a future edition of the newsletter. There’s a growing sentiment across a Democratic Party searching for a path forward: Team Obama’s bloom may be falling off the rose. More Democrats are openly criticizing former President Barack Obama’s strategists and consultants — including David Plouffe, who played a key role in Kamala Harris’ 2024 campaign — who were long treated as the high priests of their party’s politics. Democratic National Committee officials at a news event last month blamed Obama’s lack of investment in state parties over his two terms for setting back local organizing, with the party still feeling the effects. The so-called Obama coalition of voters — less politically engaged voters, younger voters and voters of color — is no more. In 2024,each of those groups shifted toward Donald Trumpin high numbers. Going forward, it could mark a clean slate for a party whose course for nearly two decades cascaded from decisions Obama had made. It was Obama who chose Joe Biden as his vice president, offering him the elevated perch that set up his 2020 election and his aborted 2024 re-election campaign. Obama selected Hillary Clinton as his secretary of state, then anointed her for the Democratic nomination in the 2016 race against Trump. The operatives Obama and his top aides empowered have carved out leading, decision-making roles at the top of the Democratic Party since then. Obama himself remains a force in the party, filling stadiums and commanding the attention of major donors. Indeed, the DNC is in talks with New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy to host Obama for a fundraiser at his home, according to two people with knowledge of the planning, which is still in its early stages. But even the former president’s luster wasshowing signsof fading last fall, a phenomenon that threatens to persist as the next crop of young voters ages into adulthood. When the 2028 presidential election arrives, it will be 20 years since Obama’s first victory. At that point, more voters will have come of age in the era of Trump than in the era of Obama. Read more from the team → Democrats in disarray, cont.:1-vote victory for Trump’s big bill inflames Democratic clash over aging leaders, by Sahil Kapur One metric has traditionally been all but definitive when it comes to New Jersey Democratic contests: the county line. And by that metric, one candidate is running circles around the others ahead of the June 10 gubernatorial primary: Rep. Mikie Sherrill. Sherrill has won endorsements from 10 of the state’s 21 county Democratic organizations, including three of the four largest. Only two of the other five candidates in the race, Rep. Josh Gottheimer and former state Senate President Steve Sweeney, have notched any county endorsements. The counties in which Sherrill has won support account for nearly 60% of all registered Democrats in the state. They include the county in which her 11th Congressional District is based, Morris, and the two others that it touches, Passaic and Essex. Gottheimer, whose 5th District is based in Bergen, also represents part of Passaic and Sussex. And Ras Baraka is the mayor of Newark, the largest city in Essex (and the state). Sweeney, the only candidate from South Jersey, has largely swept that region, where the county organizations typically act as a bloc. What has traditionally made these endorsements so meaningful is the preferred ballot position that came with them. An endorsed candidate would run at the top of the Democratic county organization’s official line, an official-looking and impossible-to-miss column that would also include a host of familiar local names running for lower offices. Names of the other candidates would be listed by themselves, often in the far reaches of the ballot. The results were predictable: Candidates running off the line almost never won and generally got blown out.

    "title": "Federal judge doubles down on order to return deported Guatemalan migrant",
    "article_text": "A federal judge doubled down on his decision ordering the return of a Guatemalan migrant to the United States after his deportation wasfound to have lacked due process. On Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Brian Murphy in Massachusettsdenied a motionfrom the Department of Justice asking the court to reconsider an order issued Friday, instructing the administration of President Donald Trump \"to take all immediate steps to facilitate\" the migrant's return to the U.S. Identified only as O.C.G., the migrant said ina court declaration that last yearhe fled his country, where he endured persecution and torture. He first attempted to seek asylum in the U.S. in March of 2024, but was quickly deported to Guatemala. A month later, he tried to seek asylum in the U.S. again. As he made his way north, in Mexico he was held for ransom, raped and targeted for being gay, the migrant's court declaration states. In May of 2024, a U.S. asylum officer determined O.C.G. \"had a reasonable fear\" to return to Guatemala and was taken into immigration custody to see his case through. In February, an immigration judge determined O.C.G. would likely be persecuted if deported to his native Guatemala, and granted him a withholding of removal, court records show. Instead, he was placed on a bus to Mexico a few days later, without any notice. Mexican authorities told O.C.G. he could apply for asylum in Mexico, but they told him he \"would be kept locked up for the months it took to make a decision or I could just accept for them to take me back to Guatemala,\" his declaration states. Afraid to request asylum in Mexico after what he experienced there, O.C.G. opted to return to Guatemala. \"I had no safe options,\" he said. In another sealed declaration submitted to the court last week, O.C.G. reported \"living in constant fear of his attackers\" in Guatemala, \"being unable to leave the place where he is staying, not being able to rely on the police to protect him, and not being able to see his mother for fear of exposing her to violence, among other hardships,\"Murphy wrote in his order Friday. “In general, this case presents no special facts or legal circumstances, only the banal horror of a man being wrongfully loaded onto a bus and sent back to a country where he was allegedly just raped and kidnapped,” Murphy wrote in his14-page decision. Friday's order marks the third time courts have instructed the Trump administration to bring back deportees found to have been improperly or illegally deported. Courts have already ordered the return ofKilmar Abrego GarciaandDaniel Lozano-Camargo, both of whom were deported in March to anotorious megaprisonin El Salvador. The Trump administration has not yet facilitated their return to the U.S. The U.S. Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. But on Saturday, the DOJ said inan X postthat \"the court’s orders in this case disrupt the president’s ability to faithfully execute our immigration laws.\" The U.S. Department of Homeland also weighed in on the case inanother X post Saturday,saying, O.C.G. \"was an illegally present alien who was granted withholding of removal to Guatemala. He was instead removed to Mexico, a safe third option for him, pending his asylum claim. Yet, this federal activist judge is ordering us to bring him back, so he can have an opportunity to prove why he should be granted asylum to a country that he has had no past connection to.\" Under U.S. and international laws, it is illegal to deport someone to a country where their life would be endangered. In hisorder denying DOJ's motion on Monday, Murphy wrote that administration officials \"have mischaracterized this Court’s order, while at the same time manufacturing the very chaos they decry.\" The judge added that the Trump administration has repeatedly violated a preliminary injunction he put in place last month, requiring it provides written notices to both noncitizens and their counsel beforeany third-country deportations and gives them meaningfulopportunities to raise fear-based claims. The administrationfailed to do this as recent as last weekwhen it raced to deporteight people from Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Cuba and Mexico toSouth Sudan,Murphy wrote. Trina Realmuto of theNational Immigration Litigation Alliance, the organization providing legal representation to O.C.G. and three other plaintiffs in the same case, told NBC News in an email Tuesday: \"As the court found, this problem is one of the government’s own making.\"",

    "title": "Steve Kornacki: New Jersey governor's race tests the staying power of Democrats' county machines",
    "article_text": "One metric has traditionally been all but definitive when it comes to New Jersey Democratic contests: the county line. And by that metric, one candidate is running circles around the others ahead of the June 10 gubernatorial primary: Rep. Mikie Sherrill. Sherrill has won endorsements from 10 of the state’s 21 county Democratic organizations, including three of the four largest. Only two of the other five candidates in the race, Rep. Josh Gottheimer and former state Senate President Steve Sweeney, have notched any county endorsements. The counties in which Sherrill has won support account for nearly 60% of all registered Democrats in the state. They include the county in which her 11th Congressional District is based, Morris, and the two others that it touches, Passaic and Essex. Gottheimer, whose 5th District is based in Bergen, also represents part of Passaic and Sussex. And Ras Baraka is the mayor of Newark, the largest city in Essex (and the state). Sweeney, the only candidate from South Jersey, has largely swept that region, where the county organizations typically act as a bloc. What has traditionally made these endorsements so meaningful is the preferred ballot position that came with them. An endorsed candidate would run at the top of the Democratic county organization’s official line, an official-looking and impossible-to-miss column that would also include a host of familiar local names running for lower offices. Names of the other candidates would be listed by themselves, often in the far reaches of the ballot. The results were predictable: Candidates running off the line almost never won and generally got blown out. The last open Democratic gubernatorial primary wasessentially settled a year before any votes were cast, when the largest county organizations threw their support to now-Gov. Phil Murphy. But asuccessful lawsuit last yearand a new lawsigned by Murphyin March have changed the game. The line is gone and county parties can no longer list all of their endorsed candidates in a special column. Primary ballots now list candidates by the office they are seeking. One of the questions heading into June’s primary is how much this has diminished the power of county endorsements. Sherrill has stuck with the traditional approach, aggressively cultivating them. Since her election to the House in 2018, when she flipped a Republican-held seat, she’s been seen as a statewide prospect and developed relationships with party leaders and insiders. She won’t enjoy the traditional benefits of running on the line, but the county organizations are still free to work on her behalf — no small matter in a state where machine politics are still practiced. And she’ll get to display the slogan of each organization that is backing her next to her name on the ballot. But others are playing it differently, either only targeting specific counties (as Gottheimer, Sweeney and Baraka have) or skipping the entire process altogether, as Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop is. Some of this, of course, is simply a nod to the advantage Sherrill already had. Gottheimer found this out the hard way, when the organization in Hudson County, one of the biggest in the state,switched its allegiancefrom him to Sherrill. But Baraka and Fulop have tried to turn their lack of organizational support into a plus, hoping to tap into popular frustration with the machine style. This has all added up to an unusually muddled primary contest — at least until the past week, whentwopollsshowed Sherrill separating herself from the pack. It could mean her heavy spending on television ads is paying off. But New Jersey’s Democratic machines, no doubt, hope it’s a sign that the old ways still work.",

    "title": "Australian actor starts fundraiser to cryogenically preserve son, who died by suicide after bullying",
    "article_text": "A woman in Australia is raising money to cryogenically preserve her 13-year-old son’s body after he died by suicide following \"months of brutal bullying,\" according to the online fundraiser. Clare McCann, anactorand filmmaker from New South Wales, launched the fundraiser Sunday, explaining that her son, Atreyu McCann, died Friday. She wrote that her son \"took his own life after months of horrific bullying at his public school.\" McCann said she repeatedly asked her son’s school and the Department of Education and Children’s Services to intervene, \"but nothing was done. No one stepped in. And now, my beautiful boy is gone,\" the fundraiser says. A spokesperson for the New South Wales Department of Education said the agency was devastated to learn of the death. McCann told7News Sydneythat from the moment her son started high school, he was subjected to bullying. Even after her son's death, she said, no students were disciplined. \"None of them were suspended, none of them were expelled. I feel completely let down,\" she told the Australian outlet. Officials said the Education Department and the school had been working with the family and will team with authorities to understand the circumstances of the teen's death. McCann is seeking $300,000 Australian to preserve his body within the next seven days — \"or the opportunity for him to live again will be lost forever.\"Cryopreservationis the concept of freezing humans as soon as they die, with the hope of reviving them using future medicine. \"If we miss this window, we lose the chance for any future revival that science may offer. This is about hope and justice. Refusing to let my son’s story end in silence,\" McCann wrote. In the fundraiser, she said she planned to use the money for the \"immediate cryopreservation and legal transportation,\" medical and legal services for the procedure and a trust in her son’s name. McCann said she wants to use the money to ensure \"this never happens again.\" \"Please help us preserve our beloved Atreyu and give his life the dignity and future that his school stole from him,\" the fundraiser said. Australia’s only cryogenics facility is on board to try. \"100% sure — we’re not certain. No guarantees. But there’s a reasonable probability,\" Peter Tsolakides of Southern Cryonics told 7News. According to thecompany’s website, its mission is to promote \"scientifically based cryonic suspension as a credible option for life extension.\" The website says cryonic suspension involves encasing a body, cooling it to a vitrified state over several days, placing it in a stainless-steel vessel and maintaining it long term in a liquid nitrogen storage environment to prevent the deterioration of tissues \"for centuries if necessary.\" As of Tuesday afternoon, over $7,300 Australian had been raised. McCann had sharedan Instagram postover the weekend, announcing her son’s death. \"As my worst nightmare has come to life my child’s has been stolen. It breaks my heart beyond what words can compare to share that in a moment of unbearable pain Atreyu took his own life,\" she wrote. \"This was not his fault. He was let down by the schooling system as he suffered horrendous amounts of bullying,\" she continued. \"Now I humbly beg of you to help me preserve his life and help me fight against this inhumane landslide of child suicides caused by unchecked bullying by schools and teachers.\" McCann did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday. If you or someone you know is in crisis, call 988 to reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline. You can also call the network, previously known as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, at800-273-8255, text HOME to 741741 or visitSpeakingOfSuicide.com/resourcesfor additional resources.",

    "article_text": "By Noam Levey In an Arizona county that voted for Trump 2-to-1, many people rely on Medicaid, would hate to lose it, and are persuaded that there is fraud that can be cut from the program. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:Gila County, Arizona, went big for Donald Trump and backed the president 2 to 1 in last year's election. The county also relies a lot on Medicaid, the federal health insurance program that Trump's Republican allies in Congress are looking to cut. Well, that makes for some complicated feelings about Medicaid.

Heather Heisler's husband has relied on the program for years.HEISLER: We're ranchers, and there's not much money in ranching. Most people think there is, but there isn't.LEVEY: Heisler was selling crafts at the festival. She says Medicaid was especially helpful after her husband had an accident.

The result, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office - 10 million people will likely lose Medicaid insurance. In Gila County, close to 4 in 10 residents are on Medicaid and the related children's health insurance program.

But to retiree Rick Uhl, the problems feel real. I caught up with him at the Globe Senior Center as he was stacking chairs after lunch.RICK UHL: There's a lot of waste, of money not being accounted for, and I think that's a shame.LEVEY: Downtown at the fair, I talk to David Sander and his wife Linda about Republican plans for Medicaid.DAVID SANDER: I've heard that they really aren't cutting it. Now, some people want to have more money spent, and they're not going to spend that much, but they're actually not cutting back. That's my understanding.LEVEY: The Sanders have a neighbor on Medicaid. Linda says the neighbor wouldn't be able to live without the program.LINDA SANDER: Couldn't afford to have an apartment, make her bills and survive.LEVEY: Her fate and the fate of millions of others who rely on Medicaid now hang on what Congress decides 2,000 miles away in Washington.In Globe, Arizona, I'm Noam Levey.Copyright © 2025 NPR.

The authoritative record of NPR’s programming is the audio record. NOAM LEVEY: Globe, Arizona, is an old copper mining town about 90 miles over the mountains from Phoenix. Down by the former train depot, there's a street festival every month with food trucks and live music.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LEVEY: I visited to find out what people in a conservative place like this thought about the Medicaid debate in Washington. House Republicans just advanced a plan to cut more than $700 billion from the safety net program.Can I interrupt you guys for a second?HEATHER HEISLER: Sure.LEVEY: I'm a health care reporter from Washington, D.C.It wasn't hard to find people who were on Medicaid or knew someone who was. Heather Heisler's husband has relied on the program for years.HEISLER: We're ranchers, and there's not much money in ranching. Most people think there is, but there isn't.LEVEY: Heisler was selling crafts at the festival. She says Medicaid was especially helpful after her husband had an accident. A forklift tipped over and part of his left foot was amputated.HEISLER: If anything happens, he's able to go to the doctor, he's able to go to the emergency room, get medicines.LEVEY: And if he lost the coverage?HEISLER: Oh, we would - it would be very bad for him.LEVEY: GOP lawmakers want to put work requirements on some Medicaid enrollees and make people file more paperwork to prove they're eligible. The result, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office - 10 million people will likely lose Medicaid insurance. In Gila County, close to 4 in 10 residents are on Medicaid and the related children's health insurance program. That's nearly double what it was 15 years ago.FERNANDO SHIPLEY: And a lot of people think that, oh, well, those are the people that aren't working. Not necessarily.LEVEY: Fernando Shipley runs a State Farm office in town. He's a city council member and former mayor.SHIPLEY: If you're a single parent with two kids and you're making $20 an hour, you're not making ends meet. You got to pay rent. You got to feed those kids.LEVEY: The growing importance of Medicaid to places like Globe, Arizona, helps explain why congressional Republicans face so much resistance to their proposed cuts. Bob Ward has been polling for a coalition trying to protect Medicaid. His firm also works for Trump.BOB WARD: There's been a shift in the public's attitude and particularly, you know, voters on the right that sometimes government plays a role in getting people health care, and that's OK. And if you take away that health care, people are going to be angry about it.LEVEY: Back in Globe, I found people who might be OK with some cuts to Medicaid. I met Debbie Cox at her property management office just outside downtown. The squat building is by a McDonald's on a busy road where trucks roll by every few minutes.DEBBIE COX: Service First Realty. OK, go ahead.LEVEY: She was wrapping up some calls on a Friday afternoon.COX: Would you give me a call next week? 'Cause I need to start and do a walk-through inspection.LEVEY: Cox has tenants who rely on Medicaid. And at the domestic violence shelter where Cox is president of the board, she says staff always look to enroll women and their kids. Still, she has mixed feelings about the program.COX: It's not that I don't see the need for it. I see the need for it literally on a weekly basis.

Can I interrupt you guys for a second?HEATHER HEISLER: Sure.LEVEY: I'm a health care reporter from Washington, D.C.It wasn't hard to find people who were on Medicaid or knew someone who was. Heather Heisler's husband has relied on the program for years.HEISLER: We're ranchers, and there's not much money in ranching. Most people think there is, but there isn't.LEVEY: Heisler was selling crafts at the festival. She says Medicaid was especially helpful after her husband had an accident. A forklift tipped over and part of his left foot was amputated.HEISLER: If anything happens, he's able to go to the doctor, he's able to go to the emergency room, get medicines.LEVEY: And if he lost the coverage?HEISLER: Oh, we would - it would be very bad for him.LEVEY: GOP lawmakers want to put work requirements on some Medicaid enrollees and make people file more paperwork to prove they're eligible. The result, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office - 10 million people will likely lose Medicaid insurance. In Gila County, close to 4 in 10 residents are on Medicaid and the related children's health insurance program. That's nearly double what it was 15 years ago.FERNANDO SHIPLEY: And a lot of people think that, oh, well, those are the people that aren't working. Not necessarily.LEVEY: Fernando Shipley runs a State Farm office in town. He's a city council member and former mayor.SHIPLEY: If you're a single parent with two kids and you're making $20 an hour, you're not making ends meet. You got to pay rent. You got to feed those kids.LEVEY: The growing importance of Medicaid to places like Globe, Arizona, helps explain why congressional Republicans face so much resistance to their proposed cuts. Bob Ward has been polling for a coalition trying to protect Medicaid. His firm also works for Trump.BOB WARD: There's been a shift in the public's attitude and particularly, you know, voters on the right that sometimes government plays a role in getting people health care, and that's OK. And if you take away that health care, people are going to be angry about it.LEVEY: Back in Globe, I found people who might be OK with some cuts to Medicaid. I met Debbie Cox at her property management office just outside downtown. The squat building is by a McDonald's on a busy road where trucks roll by every few minutes.DEBBIE COX: Service First Realty. OK, go ahead.LEVEY: She was wrapping up some calls on a Friday afternoon.COX: Would you give me a call next week? 'Cause I need to start and do a walk-through inspection.LEVEY: Cox has tenants who rely on Medicaid. And at the domestic violence shelter where Cox is president of the board, she says staff always look to enroll women and their kids. Still, she has mixed feelings about the program.COX: It's not that I don't see the need for it. I see the need for it literally on a weekly basis. But I also see a need for revamping it significantly because it's been taken advantage of for so long.LEVEY: How many people are actually taking advantage of Medicaid and how much waste there is in the program are hotly debated.

HEISLER: Oh, we would - it would be very bad for him.LEVEY: GOP lawmakers want to put work requirements on some Medicaid enrollees and make people file more paperwork to prove they're eligible. The result, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office - 10 million people will likely lose Medicaid insurance. In Gila County, close to 4 in 10 residents are on Medicaid and the related children's health insurance program. That's nearly double what it was 15 years ago.FERNANDO SHIPLEY: And a lot of people think that, oh, well, those are the people that aren't working.

He's a city council member and former mayor.SHIPLEY: If you're a single parent with two kids and you're making $20 an hour, you're not making ends meet. You got to pay rent.

LEVEY: The growing importance of Medicaid to places like Globe, Arizona, helps explain why congressional Republicans face so much resistance to their proposed cuts. Bob Ward has been polling for a coalition trying to protect Medicaid. His firm also works for Trump.BOB WARD: There's been a shift in the public's attitude and particularly, you know, voters on the right that sometimes government plays a role in getting people health care, and that's OK. And if you take away that health care, people are going to be angry about it.LEVEY: Back in Globe, I found people who might be OK with some cuts to Medicaid. I met Debbie Cox at her property management office just outside downtown. The squat building is by a McDonald's on a busy road where trucks roll by every few minutes.DEBBIE COX: Service First Realty. OK, go ahead.LEVEY: She was wrapping up some calls on a Friday afternoon.COX: Would you give me a call next week? 'Cause I need to start and do a walk-through inspection.LEVEY: Cox has tenants who rely on Medicaid. And at the domestic violence shelter where Cox is president of the board, she says staff always look to enroll women and their kids. Still, she has mixed feelings about the program.COX: It's not that I don't see the need for it. I see the need for it literally on a weekly basis.

    "title": "Almost 180,000 Palestinians displaced by latest Israeli military offensive",
    "article_text": "By Daniel Estrin , Anas Baba Gaza City tents on May 25, 2025.Anas Baba/NPRhide caption GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip — A new wave of mass displacement is redrawing the landscape of Gaza. A picturesque harbor is now blanketed in tents. A building belonging to the Qatari diplomatic mission is now a refugee camp. Nearly 180,000 Palestinians have been on the move seeking new shelter since Israel launched an intensified military offensive two weeks ago, aUnited Nations-led humanitarian groupsaid Tuesday. Loading... Israel's military has ordered the evacuations, saying its ultimate aim is to capture 75% of the territory, send civilians to a zone in the south secured by its forces, and defeat the Palestinian militant group Hamas after more than a year and a half of war. Hunger and death also hang over Gaza's 2.1 million residents, as Israel is allowing small amounts of food into the territory, and increasing its airstrikes. People embrace in the aftermath of the Gaza City School airstrike on May 27, 2025.Anas Baba/NPRhide caption One strike early Monday set ablaze a Gaza City school where newly displaced families were sheltering. It killed more than 30 people including at least 18 children, a Gaza rescue group said. Israel's military said it targeted Hamas militants plotting attacks there. \"We found body parts and everyone screaming on fire,\" said Jamalat Abdelaal, who came running from her tent nearby, trying to help. \"Children. What did they do?\" A boy sits on the rubble left from the Gaza City School airstrike on May 27, 2025.Anas Baba/NPRhide caption A U.S.-backed group begins handing out food in a program criticized by the U.N. Extreme hunger is widespread after a nearly three-month ban on food, medicine and other supplies. Under U.S. pressure, Israel is allowing limited quantities back into Gaza, under a new plan that aid groups are criticizing. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a U.S.-backed group, has begun distributing food in southern Gaza. The Israeli military said the aid distribution was taking place in two sites in southern Gaza. The military released a video of one large empty site in a sandy desert area near the Mediterranean shore, and images of the food distributed, including canned meat, pasta, oil and crackers. Videos circulating on social media show streams of Palestinians walking down a long dirt path amid the rubble of Israeli strikes, carrying large cardboard food parcels on their shoulders, collected from a new fenced zone. Israel says the system is intended to deny supplies to Hamas and weaken its control in Gaza. \"American companies will distribute the food directly to Palestinian families. They'll do so in (a) safe zone secured by our military,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video. \"Palestinian civilians will have to move south to get food, and this will allow us to complete our goal of destroying Hamas, while enabling aid to reach the civilian population.\" Israeli soldiers are said to be on guard nearby, but Palestinians reported there were no security checks or requirements to show identification documents, drawing into question Israel's stated goal of isolating Hamas militants from the aid. Within hours of the first distribution points being opened, large crowds of people seeking food swarmed one of the sites, prompting Israeli troops to fire warning shots nearby and the contractors working for the U.S security company to flee. The U.N. and aid groups working in Gaza say this program would compel Palestinians to move south to get food, amounting to forcible displacement and restrictions on aid. Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich says the ultimate goal is to move Palestinians to other countries. Hamas warned Palestinians not to take food from the group, calling it a plot to permanently move Palestinians abroad. Palestinian civilians told NPR they feel caught in the middle, between feeding their hungry families and taking part in a displacement plan. Gaza City tents on May 25, 2025.Anas Baba/NPRhide caption \"This is so conflicting for me,\" said Malek Al Shenbari, living in a tent with his three children in southern Gaza. \"But if it reached the level of deciding between my children or the homeland, of course my children are more important than anything.\" The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation's founding director, Jake Wood, a former U.S. Marine, abruptly resigned Sunday, saying the program would not adhere to humanitarian principles. The group appointed a new director, John Acree, a former official with the US Agency for International Development. The group has not divulged its funding. Israel's opposition leader, Yair Lapid, has claimed without providing evidence the Israeli government is secretly funding it. A boy plays near the encampment in Gaza City on May 25, 2025.Anas Baba/NPRhide caption A picturesque harbor is now a tent camp for the newly displaced Palestinians newly displaced in tents describe daily and nightly miseries. \"There are flies and mosquitoes feeding on our blood,\" said Sulaf Wishah, who recently pitched a tent on the Gaza City harbor with her family. The family set a trap on the floor of the tent to catch the mouse that's been eating the little bread they have. Packs of dogs roam at night, and Israeli drones buzz above, she said. \"There are no feelings,\" Wishah said. \"You wake up and go to sleep to the sound of shelling, eat and drink to the sound of shelling, pray to the sound of shelling.\" She is seven months pregnant, but doctors say they can't detect a pulse from her fetus, and that she suffers from malnutrition, she said. NPR's Daniel Estrin reported from Tel Aviv, Anas Baba reported from Gaza City and Ahmad Abuhamda contributed to this story from Cairo, Egypt. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Susan Brownmiller, whose landmark book changed attitudes on rape, dies at 90",
    "article_text": "Elizabeth Blair Susan Brownmiller poses with her book in New York, Oct. 18, 1975.Suzanne Vlamis/APhide caption Susan Brownmiller, author of the landmark bookAgainst Our Will: Men, Women and Rape,has died at the age of 90. Her death was confirmed by historian Claire Bond Potter, who is writing a biography of Brownmiller. In 1975, Against Our Willwas a groundbreaking text that explored the history of rape and helped debunk the long-held view that victims were partly to blame. Against Our Willbecame a bestseller because it was \"the first book about sexual assault written for a general audience,\" Potter wrote in an email to NPR. \"The book asked all of its readers to think broadly about sexual assault as not just as a crime, or even the outcome of patriarchal power, but rather a mechanism for enforcing male dominance through pervasive fear.\" Brownmiller spent four years researching and writingAgainst Our Will,often digging deep into library archives. She explored mass rape during wartime, bias against female victims among police and juries, and the persistent cultural attitudes toward rape such as the \"she-was-asking-for-it\" myth. \"From prehistoric times to the present, I believe, rape has played a critical function,\" Brownmiller wrote. \"It is nothing more or less than a conscious process of intimidation by whichall menkeepall womenin a state of fear.\" Against Our Willhas been translated into numerous languages and was named one of The New York Public Library's Books of the Century. Brownmiller was one ofTimemagazine'sWomen of the Year for 1975. Though applauded by feminists at the time, the book received pushback from Black Civil Rights activists for the way in which Brownmiller wrote about the role of race in rape history. Against Our Will's most controversial chapter was \"A Question of Race.\" While noting that the data was likely flawed, Brownmiller cited FBI statistics that claimed rapes were committed by Black men at rates that were much higher than their percentage of the population. In a section aboutEmmett Till,the teenager who was brutally murdered for whistling at a white woman, Brownmiller writes that Till's whistle \"was no small tweet of hubba-hubba or melodious approval for a well-turned ankle… it was a deliberate insult just short of physical assault, a last reminder to Carolyn Bryant that this black boy, Till, had in mind to possess her.\" Brownmiller's arguments, wrote human rights activist Angela Davis, were \"pervaded with racist ideas.\" In her bookWomen, Race and ClassDavis wrote, \"While Brownmiller deplores the sadistic punishment inflicted on Emmett Till, the Black youth emerges, nonetheless, as a guilty sexist — almost as guilty as his white racist murderers.\" Davis continued, \"After all, she argues, both Till and his murderers were exclusively concerned about their rights of possession over women.\" Feminists also took Brownmiller to task later in life, when she seemed to suggestin an interview with The Cutthat young women who drank alcohol or wore provocative clothing were in part responsible if they were raped. \"And my feeling about young women trapped in sex situations that they don't want is: 'Didn't you see the warning signs? Who do you expect to do your fighting for you?' It is a little late, after you are both undressed, to say 'I don't want this,'\" she told journalist Katie Van Syckle in 2015. Brownmiller was born in Brooklyn in 1935 to working class, Jewish parents. She pursued a career as an actor before turning to writing full-time, working for such publications asNewsweekand theVillage Voice. As an activist, she cofounded New York Radical Feminists and belonged to the group Women Against Pornography. Her other books include a biography of Shirley Chisholm for children,Femininity, andIn Our Time: Memoir of a Revolution. Brownmiller oncewrotethat her \"chosen path — to fight against physical harm, specifically the terror of violence against women — had its origins in what I had learned in Hebrew School about the pogroms and the Holocaust.\" In 2013, Brownmiller wrote a new preface for an edition ofAgainst Our Will.Sheapplauded \"some amazing developments in the effort to combat sexual assault that could not have been anticipated several decades ago.\" She took pride that the attention she and her book received played a role \"in the groundbreaking effort to reverse the traditional wisdom on assaultive acts against women and children.\" Jennifer Vanasco edited this story.

    "title": "A video of the French president's wife shoving him went viral. Here's why it matters",
    "article_text": "By Rachel Treisman In a grab taken from video, France's President Emmanuel Macron is shoved while preparing to disembark a plane in Hanoi, Vietnam on Sunday.Hau Dinh/APhide caption French President Emmanuel Macron is downplaying a viral video that appears to show his wife shoving him in the face, describing it as part of a recent disinformation campaign against him. The footage,filmed by the Associated Presson Sunday, shows Macron standing in the open doorway of his plane after touching down in Hanoi, Vietnam. He seems to be talking to someone when a pair of red-sleeved arms reaches out and pushes him in the face. Macron briefly looks startled, takes a step back, and quickly turns to wave at the cameras. French first lady Brigitte Macron, wearing a red jacket, emerges behind him and they walk down the steps side by side. Macron appears to offer her his arm, which she does not accept. As the footage circulated,French media reportedthat the Élysée Palace, Macron's office, initially  dismissed it as the product of artificial intelligence. But on Monday, they confirmed the authenticity of the video. \"It was a moment when the president and his wife were relaxing one last time before the start of the trip by having a laugh,\" the Élysée said,according to Reuters. \"It was a moment of closeness.\" TheMacrons' marriagehas long been a subject of controversy. Macron fell in love with his high school drama teacher, Brigitte Auzière, when he was just 15 years old. She was 24 years older and married with three children. Despite Macron's parents sending him away to Paris to finish school, he kept in close contact with Auzière and vowed to marry her one day — which he did in 2007. Macron, whose visit to Vietnam kicks off a week-long tour of Southeast Asia,told reporterson Monday that the video had simply captured him \"squabbling and, rather, joking with my wife.\" \"I'm surprised by it, it turns into some kind of global catastrophe where people are even coming up with theories to explain it,\" he said, accordingto a translationfrom theNew York Times. \"It's nonsense.\" Darren Linvill, co-director of the Media Forensics Hub at Clemson University, told NPR that it's not surprising that a video showing a world leader in such a position would go viral — or that it would be used to promote a certain agenda. \"In today's digital environment, I think it is not a question of whether it goes viral, it's to what ends people want to use that video for,\" he said. In this case, Macron — and other disinformation experts — say Russia is seizing the moment to try to make him look weak. This is not the first time a video of Macron has gone viral. He noted that although the plane video is real, the public interpretation of it is incorrect — and called it another example of online disinformation aimed at undermining him in recent weeks. Earlier this month,a video of Macron meetingwith the German and British leaders on a train to Kyiv made headlines when some social media users speculated that a tissue lying on the table was actually a bag of cocaine. The Élysée debunked those rumors in apost on social media, saying they had been spread by France's enemies at home and abroad. \"When European unity becomes inconvenient, disinformation goes so far as to make a simple tissue look like drugs,\" it wrote. When European unity becomes inconvenient, disinformation goes so far as to make a simple tissue look like drugs.This fake news is being spread by France’s enemies, both abroad and at home. We must remain vigilant against manipulation.pic.twitter.com/xyXhGm9Dsr Days later, another moment drew attention whena lingering handshakebetween Macron and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at a summit in Albania wet viral. Video footage showed Erdogan holding on to Macron's middle finger for over 10 seconds before eventually letting go as they both laughed. Viewers speculated whether this was a blunder, power play or something else. Macron reassured reporters on Monday that, like the other recent incidents, it was harmless. \"It's been three weeks — if you look at the international agenda of the president of the French Republic, from Kyiv to Tirana to Hanoi, there are people who have watched the videos and believe that I shared a bag of cocaine, that I had a 'mano a mano' with a Turkish president and that right now I'm having a fight with my wife,\" he said. \"None of this is true.\" Macron specifically denounced \"networks that are quite well-traceable,\" as the AFP translates, including French extremists and \"the Russians.\" The plane video seems to have been amplified online by Russian social media accounts, including at least one Kremlin official. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova wrote on Telegram that Macron had received a \"right hook from his wife,\"according to AFP, and speculated that his office might blame Russia by way of explanation. \"Maybe it was the 'hand of the Kremlin'?\" she wrote. Nina Khrushcheva, a professor of international affairs at The New School, tells NPR that the video went viral in Russia significantly because it contradicts Macron's public image of toughness — in general (remember those2024 boxing photos?) and towards Russia specifically (who hasspoken in recent monthsabout European countries sending troops to Ukraine). Macron positions himself as \"a giant confrontation\" to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Khrushcheva explains, especially since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. \"Macron acts as if he's very macho, but look at him, it's all a performance … because he's been beaten by the wife,\" she says, explaining the Russian perspective. \"So in this sense, of course it got viral and became sort of a joke for the Russians … like 'He's tough on Russia? Look at this, he's not even tough on his wife.'\" Linvill, of Clemson, says that while pro-Russian voices may frame the video as a joke, they are actually sending a \"very serious message.\" He says they will use this video — and similar content — to try to portray Macron as foolish or powerless. \"Anything they can do to chip away at the common perception of him as this strong leader, they're going to take advantage of that,\" he says, adding that such characterizations also bolster Putin's domestic image by making him look more competent when compared to Macron. Linvill says it's not unusual for Russia to target Western leaders in this way, but Macron's prominence and his advocacy role in NATO make him \"target number one.\" Every moment Macron and his team have to spend defending against these kinds of attacks, Linvill says, is a moment that is \"keeping them away from keeping the West together.\" \"I think we're seeing a change in what has been decades of a status quo that favored the West, and Russia and China and other countries that stand in opposition to the West and to NATO are looking to chip away at what remains of those traditions and those standards,\" he says. \"And these incremental attacks on leaders like Macron — who are trying to put their finger in the dam, as it were, and hold the West together — these attacks are going to continue and they're going to continue to work to undermine his legitimacy.\" NPR's Jaclyn Diaz contributed reporting.

    "article_text": "By Bill Chappell Mountaineer Kami Rita Sherpa broke his own record after climbing Mount Everest for the 31st time. He's seen here last year, acknowledging a crowd that celebrated his then-record 30th summit of Everest.Prakash Mathema/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption Kami Rita Sherpa has broken his own record for climbing to the summit of Mount Everest, reaching the peak for the 31st time on Tuesday. Now 55, Kami Rita first climbed to the top of the world's highest mountain in 1994, when he was 24 years old. Kami Rita has climbed Everest nearly every year since the 1990s, sometimes completing two climbs in one climbing season. In 2019, for instance, he reached the summittwice in one week. A legendary climber, Kami Rita has trekked to many of the world's highest peaks. But considering only his Everest summits all together, he has climbed nearly 90,000 feet above sea level on the famous peak: 89,992 feet, using thelatest assessment of Everest's height. That's about 17 miles above sea level — equivalent to Earth'sstratosphere. Right now, the closest competitor to Kami Rita's Guinness World Record for most ascents of Everest is Pasang Dawa Sherpa, a fellow Nepali guide who recently reached the top of Everestfor the 29th time. Known as Pa Dawa, he completed his first Everest summit four years after Kami Rita first reached the height — but has finished the climb twice in a single seasonmultiple times. A new feat was recorded this season, when Tashi Gyalzen Sherpa, 29, reached the summit of Everest four times in just 15 days, asThe Himalayan Timesreports. He has now reached the peakeight times. Nepali climber Tashi Gyalzen Sherpa, center, arrives at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, Nepal, on Tuesday, after he made a record-breaking four summits of Everest in 15 days.Prakash Mathema/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption Another emerging rival is Nima Rinji Sherpa, who last year became the youngest person to summit the highest 14 peaks in the world,at 18 years old. Nima Rinji recentlywrote on Instagramabout his ambitions to fill what he called \"a lot of space left in the mountaineering history books,\" mentioning projects such as climbing an 8,000-meter peak in winter without a fixed rope, supplementary oxygen and other aids. Kami Rita reached Everest's summit around 4 a.m. local time on Tuesday, while leading a team for Seven Summit Treks, according to the expedition agency. \"He is not just a national climbing hero, but a global symbol of Everest itself,\"the agency saidas it announced the feat. \"Wishing him a safe descent back to base camp, and looking forward to welcoming him in Kathmandu.\" New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Nepali Sherpa Tenzing Norgay were the first climbing team to summit Everest, known in Nepali as Sagarmatha. They completed their climb in May 1953. But in recent years, Everest has sometimes seen high-altitude traffic jams as hundreds of mountaineers attempt to reach the summit on a compressed schedule after concerns such as extreme winds shortened the climbing season. AsThe Kathmandu Postreported in mid-May, \"Nepal's Department of Tourism has issued permits to 456 foreign climbers, just shy of the record 479 granted in 2023. When factoring in Nepali guides, often assigned at a one-to-one ratio, more than 1,000 people may try to reach the top.\" A previous version of this story said incorrectly that Kami Rita Sherpa's Everest ascents totaled 899,992 feet and about 170.5 miles. In fact, they totaled 89,992 feet and about 17 miles. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "By Geoff Brumfiel , Ayana Archie SpaceX's mega rocket Starship is prepared for a test flight from Starbase, Texas, on Monday, May 26, 2025.Eric Gay/APhide caption Elon Musk's giant, multi-billion-dollar mega rocket launched again from Texas on Tuesday evening for another test flight. This time, however, the rocket lost lost control due to a leak, making a controlled landing unlikely, SpaceX announcers said during the flight's livestream. The rocket, known as Starship, had experienced a similar issue during its third test flight. Tuesday's voyage comes aftertwo spectacularfailures earlier this year that saw the test vehicles explode high above the Caribbean, scattering debris and forcing aircraft in the regionto scramble. Starship is the largest rocketever built. On this flight, its lower stage, known as \"Super Heavy,\" used 33 powerful engines to lift Starship to the edge of space. Starship then separated from Super Heavy and ignited its six engines. It flew around earth for less than an hour, while conducting numerous tests. Although several dummy satellites were scheduled for launch, a door on the ship did not open as intended. Coverage of the test flight ended when announcers lost contact with the rocket, but they predicted it would land in a disoriented position. You can watch a replay of the launch below: Watch Starship's ninth flight test →https://t.co/Gufroc2kUzhttps://t.co/NYF0ZMyeGp SpaceX says it would be conducting the landing over water because it wants to test whether the booster can successfully land without one of its three center engines igniting. The engine will be deliberately disabled to see if the booster can compensate using other engines on board. Starship has completed a similar journey three times before, but it never made it past North America on its last two test flights. Minutes after both launches, it exploded, showering the Caribbean islands of Turks and Caicos with debris and forcing airliners to divert from their flight paths. The Starship launchpad is located in Boca Chica, Texas, near a state park and federal wildlife refuge,which has drawn scrutiny from environmentalists.Environmentalists have scrutinized the Starship launches.Records from the Environmental Protection Agency and Texas Commission on Environmental Quality show SpaceX has violated the Clean Water Act by spewing tens of thousands of gallons of wastewater into the Texas environment.  Last September, the agencies collectively fined Musk about $150,000 last September for the infractions. Additionally,a reportby the Coastal Bend Bays & Estuaries Program concluded that SpaceX launches have destroyed the nests of vulnerable shorebirds. Success is uncertain, but entertainment is guaranteed! ✨pic.twitter.com/nn3PiP8XwG But the company has trekked on.SpaceX says it now believes the failures were caused by two separate problems with Starship. The first, in January, was caused by \"a harmonic response several times stronger in flight than had been seen during testing, which led to increased stress on hardware in the propulsion system,\" according to the company. The second failure in March was caused by a hardware failure above one of the spacecraft's six engines, which resulted in an onboard fire. \"While the failure manifested at a similar point in the flight timeline as Starship's seventh flight test, it is worth noting that the failures are distinctly different,\" the company saidin a statementafter its investigation of the second incident.

    "title": "Despite the pause on high tariffs, Chinese factories still face high uncertainty",
    "article_text": "By Emily Feng , Aowen Cao Shipping containers are seen ready for transport at the Guangzhou Port in southern China's Guangdong province on April 17.Ng Han Guan/APhide caption BEIJING — Hours after the U.S. announced it was temporarily pausing most of its high tariffs on Chinese goods on May 12, NPR checked in with Jiang Kun, a freight forwarder based in southern China. How was business going? Within seconds, he replied with just two words: \"Taking off.\" Just last month, goods from China faced an eye-watering tax ofup to 245%if they came to the U.S. Then, the U.S. and Chinaannounceda 90-day pause on most of those tariffs, unleashing a surge in pent-up exports from China to the U.S. that hassnarled logistics linesand jacked up freight prices as shippers frantically divert capacity back to China. But there is still huge uncertainty among factory owners in China, who tell NPR orders are down overall asspookedAmerican retailers hedge over whether tariffs will come roaring back after the pause. \"It is like watching two children play a game between themselves,\" Joyce Tian scoffed, when asked about U.S.-China trade relations. Tian, a sales manager in Dongguan, where many Chinese factories are located, says exports to the U.S. make up half of her company's business. They make fans and heaters, for which American importers would normally be placing orders in just a few weeks in preparation for the fall. But this year, overall sales volumes are low. \"Some [American retailers] still have not made a decision [about whether to buy from us]. They have not responded to our emails. Maybe they are still waiting and watching,\" says Ivy Lee, a sales manager at a Chinese homeware manufacturer that sold to retailers like Walmart before the tariffs hit. Lee believes demand will return eventually: \"These are everyday consumables. If they need them, they will buy.\" As for the broader uncertainty, she adds, \"I try not to worry too much. Policy changes are out of our hands.\" Some small businesses in the U.S. are rushing to buy whatever stock Chinese factories already have on hand, in case tariffs go back up again. \"For now, everyone is trying to get as much of their shipments to the U.S. completed as possible within these few months,\" saysTian Xin, a freight forwarder who arranges logistics for large freight and also coordinates paperwork for customs clearance for Chinese exports. Jenny Tianworks in freight forwarding in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen and says she has been fielding calls for huge product orders. But the problem is shipping. \"We might soon be facing what we call 'container rollovers,' where even if you have already paid for a container spot on the ship, your container might not get loaded and is pushed onto the next available vessel,\" Tian says. For her company, the cost of shipping to the West Coast of the U.S. has increased by $1,500 per container. Many ships servicing the routes between the West Coast and China have been diverted to other routes, creating delays as exporters in China wait for ships to return to ports in China. \"You need those vessels at minimum to come back [to China], and you create disturbances, and you don't have enough empty containers, et cetera,\" says Eric Martin-Neuville, an executive vice president in Singapore for GEODIS, the French logistics company. In the meantime, Chinese freight forwarders are making immediate contingency plans that exclude selling to the U.S. \"We have to be looking every day\" for new clients, says Mike Zhong, a freight forwarder based in southern China. Chris Que, a regional director at a home appliances factory in the southern city of Guangzhou, says his company has held off selling to the U.S. market for now, due to concerns over volatility. The company produces home appliances, including gas boilers and heat pumps. \"The U.S. policies are unstable right now. Tariffs can be raised or changed at any moment,\" said Que. Instead, he is focusing on European customers. Data from China's national statistics bureau shows that when U.S. tariffs reached their peak, the value of overall exportsactually jumpedby 8.1% in April when compared to the previous year,beatingeconomists' predictions. Trade with the U.S had dropped, but exports to Southeast Asia and Europesurgedby levels high enough to make up for the lost business — though it is possible some of those exports stillended upin the U.S. Emily Feng reported from Washington, D.C., and Aowen Cao contributed research from Beijing.

    "article_text": "Rob Stein The CDC is removing recommendations that children and pregnant people get the COVID vaccine.Jane Tyska/Digital First Media/Media News Group/Getty Imageshide caption The federal government has removed COVID-19 vaccines from the list of shots recommended for healthy pregnant women and children, federal health officials announced Tuesday. \"I couldn't be more pleased to announce that as of today the COVID vaccine for healthy children and healthy pregnant women has been removed from the CDC recommended immunization schedule,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced ina video posted on X. \"We're now one step closer to realizing President Trump's promise to make America healthy again.\" The decision will make it much harder for parents to get their children vaccinated and for pregnant people to get the shots because insurance companies will likely no longer pay for them. \"Last year the Biden administration urged healthy children to get yet another COVID shot despite the lack of any clinical data to support the repeat booster strategy in children,\" Kennedy said. In announcing the decision, Kennedy was flanked by Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Martin Makary and National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya. \"It's common sense and it's good science,\" Bhattacharya said. \"There's no evidence healthy kids need it today and most countries have stopped recommending it for children,\" Makary added. The decision was apparently made without the usual input from independent outside advisers. Although independent advisers have been reconsidering the COVID vaccine recommendations, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention'sAdvisory Committee on Immunization Practicesisn't scheduled to meet until later this month to make a recommendation. In response to questions on this issue, Department of Health and Human Services press secretary Vianca N. Rodriguez Feliciano shared the following statement: \"HHS and the CDC remain committed to gold standard science and to ensuring the health and well-being of all Americans—especially our nation's children.\" Since the vaccines became available, the government has been recommending the shots for nearly everyone, including children and pregnant people. Although children don't tend to get seriously ill from COVID, some do, especially very young children, and pregnant women remain athigh risk for serious complicationsfrom the virus. Vaccinating pregnant women alsoprotects newborn babies, who can't get vaccinated themselves but are at very high risk for serious complications from the virus. \"It's really concerning,\" Dr.Sean O'Leary, who chairs the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Infectious Diseases, told NPR. \"I think it's going to be confusing not only for parents but also for public health professionals and medical professionals as well. This takes away choice.\" Dr. Steven J. Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said his organization is \"extremely disappointed\" by the removal of the recommendation for COVID shots during pregnancy. \"As ob-gyns who treat patients every day, we have seen firsthand how dangerous COVID infection can be during pregnancy and for newborns who depend on maternal antibodies from the vaccine for protection,\" he said in a statement. \"The science has not changed. It is very clear that COVID infection during pregnancy can be catastrophic and lead to major disability.\" The announcement comes a week afterthe administration made changes that could dramatically restrictthe availability of the next round of COVID boosters. The government will now require additional testing for the vaccines to be approved for use by anyone other than people who are at high risk from COVID because they are age 65 or older or have risk factors for other health problems.

    "article_text": "Elissa Nadworny Harvard University's campus in Cambridge, Mass., pictured on Saturday, as students prepared to graduate.Zhu Ziyu/Getty Imageshide caption The Trump administration is asking federal agencies to cancel their remaining federal contracts with Harvard University, worth an estimated $100 million, according to a government official. A letter from the U.S. General Services Administration, which is dated Tuesday, tells agencies to submit a list of contracts they have terminated with the university by June 6. \"Going forward, we also encourage your agency to seek alternative vendors for future services where you had previously considered Harvard,\" reads the letter, signed by Josh Gruenbaum, the commissioner of the GSA's Federal Acquisition Service. The government official, who did not want to be named because they were not authorized to speak, confirmed the authenticity of the letter, first published by theNew York Times. Harvard has not yet responded to NPR's request for comment. The battle between the Trump administration and Harvard University has been going on for several weeks. In April, the administrationfroze more than $2.2 billionin contracts and multiyear grants to the school in response to Harvard saying it would not comply with the administration's demands that it drastically change its hiring, admissions and other policies. In mid-May, a federal antisemitism task force wrote a letter telling Harvard it would lose an additional $450 million in grants from eight federal agencies, in addition to the $2.2 billion that was already frozen. That came in response to a letter the Harvard president, Alan Garber, sent to Linda McMahon, the U.S. secretary of education, denying the administration's allegations that the school was partisan. He maintained the school was \"not an arm of any political party\" and would never be. Harvard issuing to blockthe federal funding freeze. The university claims the administration's moves are unlawful and that the cuts threaten academic freedom and First Amendment rights. A hearing has been scheduled for July. Trump has alsothreatened the school's tax-exempt statusand last week, the administrationrevoked Harvard's ability to admitinternational students. The next day, the school sued, and then a judgeissued a temporary restraining order. \"We need to be firm in our commitments to what we stand for,\" Garber told NPR'sSteve Inskeep in an interview on Monday. \"And what we stand for – I believe I speak for other universities – is education, pursuit of the truth, helping to educate people for better futures.\" In response to allegations from the administration that the university has failed to protect Jewish students on campus, Garber said the school has made substantial and real progress over the past year.

    "title": "NPR and Colorado public radio stations sue Trump White House",
    "article_text": "David Folkenflik NPR President and CEO Katherine Maher testifies during a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing at the U.S. Capitol on March 26, 2025. NPR and several member stations are suing the Trump administration over an executive order directing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to stop funding NPR and PBS.Andrew Harnik/Getty Imageshide caption NPR and three Colorado public radio stations filed suit Tuesday morning in federal court against the Trump White House over thepresident's executive orderthat purportedly bars the use of Congressionally appropriated funds for NPR and PBS. \"It is not always obvious when the government has acted with a retaliatory purpose in violation of the First Amendment. 'But this wolf comes as a wolf,'\" the legal filling for the public broadcasters states. \"The Order targets NPR and PBS expressly because, in the President's view, their news and other content is not 'fair, accurate, or unbiased.'\" The line about the \"wolf\" was drawn from a1988 dissentby the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. The lawsuit says the administration is usurping Congress' power to direct how federal money will be spent and to pass laws. It names President Trump, White House budget director Russell Vought, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Maria Rosario Jackson, the chair of the National Endowment for the Arts, as defendants. A team that includes noted free speech lawyer Theodore J. Boutrous filed the lawsuit for NPR and the Colorado stationsjointly in the District of Columbia. The suit calls Trump'searly May executive order\"textbook retaliation\" and an existential threat to the public radio system \"that millions of Americans across the country rely on for vital news and information.\" \"The Executive Order is a clear violation of the Constitution and the First Amendment's protections for freedom of speech and association, and freedom of the press,\" NPR President and CEO Katherine Maher said in a statement. PBS is not a party to the lawsuit. The television network issued a statement Tuesday morning saying, \"PBS is considering every option, including taking legal action, to allow our organization to continue to provide essential programming and services to member stations and all Americans.\" The differing profiles of the three local stations joining NPR in the suit capture the appeal and reach of the broader public radio system: the statewideColorado Public Radio, which is based in Denver;Aspen Public Radiowhich broadcasts throughout the Roaring Fork Valley; andKSUT, originally founded by the Southern Ute Indian Tribe and now serving four federally recognized tribes in the Four Corners region in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah. \"Our mission — and our responsibility — is grounded in the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of the press and protects our ability to hold those in power to account without interference,\" the stations said in a joint statement. \"This includes protection against government interference in our editorial decisions as well as in purchasing, acquiring, producing and broadcasting information.\" The case is assigned to U.S. District Court Judge Randolph D. Moss, who is also handling a case involvinga related lawsuitfiled by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) against Trump. Trump's May 1st executive order took the form of a directive to the board of the CPB, which distributes more than a half-billion dollars each year to public broadcasters, primarily to local stations. By statute, three quarters of that money is devoted to television, one quarter to radio. Trump cited his authority as president under the Constitution and federal laws in making the order and said that neither NPR nor PBS \"presents a fair, accurate, or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens.\" In other public statements, Trump and his allies have called the public broadcasters \"left-wing propaganda\" and made similarly disparaging remarks. An accompanying fact sheetput out by the White Housecited the claim that NPR published articles \"insist[ing] that COVID-19 did not originate in a lab\" and \"refused to cover the Hunter Biden laptop story.\" \"The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) is creating media to support a particular political party on the taxpayers' dime. Therefore, the President is exercising his lawful authority to limit funding to NPR and PBS,\" said Harrison Fields, a White House spokesperson, in a statement on Tuesday. \"The President was elected with a mandate to ensure efficient use of taxpayer dollars, and he will continue to use his lawful authority to achieve that objective.\" NPR's Maher rejected such ideological characterizations, pointing to such statements by Trump to argue he was seeking to exact illegal retribution for their news coverage. \"This is retaliatory, viewpoint-based discrimination in violation of the First Amendment. The Supreme Court has ruled numerous times over the past 80 years that the government does not have the right to determine what counts as 'biased',\" Maher said in her statement Tuesday. \"NPR will never agree to this infringement of our constitutional rights, or the constitutional rights of our Member stations, and NPR will not compromise our commitment to an independent free press and journalistic integrity.\" Trump's legal standing to make such a decree was in question even before Tuesday's lawsuit was filed. Congress allocates money for the CPB two years in advance to insulate public broadcasters from political pressure over fleeting controversies. The CPB was authorized by Congressional statute but set up as a private corporation. Indeed,the organization is itself suing Trump over an earlier decree, in which he claimed to be firing three of the five members of CPB's board of directors. When Trump said he was ordering the CPB not to fund NPR or PBS any longer, the corporation's chief executive said he had no ability to do so. \"CPB is not a federal executive agency subject to the President's authority,\" CPB chief Patricia Harrison, a former Republican National Committee co-chair, said then in a statement. \"Congress directly authorized and funded CPB to be a private nonprofit corporation wholly independent of the federal government.\" In the statement, Harrison noted thatthe statute Congress passed to create CPB\"expressly forbade 'any department, agency, officer, or employee of the United States to exercise any direction, supervision, or control over educational television or radio broadcasting, or over [CPB] or any of its grantees or contractors.\" Harrison and CPB have effectively ignored Trump's orders — retaining, for now, its board members, as the case works through the federal courts — and taking no actions to withhold money from NPR and PBS or the hundreds of stations that send funds to the two national broadcasters. Trump specified in his order that recipients of federal funds from CPB could not, under his decree, send money to PBS and NPR. NPR typically receives about 1% of its annual revenues from the CPB and another several percent indirectly from stations. On average, CPB provides each public radio station 8 to 10% of their revenues each year. (The NEA often gives smaller grants to NPR; the NEA terminated one such award to NPR the day after Trump's executive order, according to the lawsuit.) The relationship between NPR and member stations is closely intertwined, with public radio considering itself an interconnected system. NPR's weekly audience for its programs, articles, podcasts and other offerings exceeds 43 million Americans, according to the network, including through its local stations. NPR does not own any stations itself. Local station reporters appear frequently on NPR news magazines; the network often provides editing and guidance for regional collaborations between local stations; and NPR News member stations pledge to adhere to a shared set of ethical standards. NPR manages and operates the terrestrial distribution system allowing member stations and community broadcasters to deliver and download content for broadcast. The executive order is but one front in the Trump administration's assault on the news media writ large. As a private citizen, Trump has sued ABC, CBS, Meta and X (formerly Twitter). All but CBS paid him settlements of $10 million or more, despite legal observers' saying the cases were weak. CBS's parent company,Paramount Global is in settlement talks with Trumpas federal regulators weigh whether to approve its $8 billion sale to Skydance Media. Trump sued CBS over a60 Minutesinterview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris last fall. Trump alleged that the network's editing of her answer to a question about Israel and Gaza amounted to election fraud; media lawyers and First Amendment scholars almost universally say the case should be dismissed on Constitutional free speech protections. Trump's appointee as chairperson of the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, has saidhe is open to stripping CBS of the licenses it holds for local television stationsover the60 Minutesinterview, saying \"it's not a threat, that's a penalty.\" Indeed, in just a few months as chair, Carr has initiated investigations of all the major broadcast networks — save Fox, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch, an ally of the president. Yet public media has come in for particular focus. Trump's Republican allies in the U.S. House held a hearingin March at which Maher was assailed for both personal social media posts showing a liberal tilt years before she joined the network, and journalism published before her arrival. (In her testimony, Maher pointed to NPR's policies that include a firewall preventing corporate executives from making editorial judgments for the newsroom.) PBS chief Paula Kerger was asked about a video posted on a New York City public television's website featuring a drag queen for a show intended for young children. (Kerger said it never ran on television and was taken down.) Under Carr, the FCC is investigating the underwriting spots aired by NPR and PBS member stations. He suggested they are indistinguishable from commercials on for-profit networks, a violation of federal statute. (PBS and NPR say they have worked closely with agency staffers for decades to ensure those spots adhere to the law.) Carr's FCC oversees to whom licenses are granted to broadcast using the federal airwaves. And Trump has called on Congress to eliminate all current and future funding for public media and CPB, though he has not sent lawmakers a formal request for the current funding to be clawed back. Earlier this spring, the Republican-led Congress passed a stop-gap budget measure that fully funds CPB through the end of September 2027.

    "title": "Elon Musk: There is an 80 percent chance Starship’s engine bay issues are solved",
    "article_text": "\"Once you have the transportation system to Mars, then there's a vast set of opportunities.\" On Tuesday afternoon, just a few hours before a launch attempt of the ninth flight test of SpaceX's Starship vehicle, Elon Musk spoke with Ars Technica Senior Space Editor Eric Berger to talk about where his space company goes from here. In recent weeks, Musk has dialed back his focus on politics and said he wants to devote the majority of his time to SpaceX and his other companies. So what does that mean? The conversation came just ahead of the opening of Starship's launch window, at 6:30 pm CT (23:30 UTC) in South Texas. Here is a lightly edited transcript of the interview. Ars Technica:So what does success look like with today's launch for you? Elon Musk: These launches are all about data. The most important thing is data on how to improve the tile design, so it's basically data during the high heating, re-entry phase in order to improve the tiles for the next iteration. So we've got like a dozen or more tile experiments. We're trying different coatings on tiles. We're trying different fabrication techniques, different attachment techniques. We're varying the gap filler for the tiles. And also, we want to make sure that we've solved the issues that caused the explosions in the last two flights in the upper stage engine bay. Ars:Do you feel like you've solved that? Musk: I feel like we've got an 80 to—I don't want to tempt fate, I was going to say 90—but we've got about an 80 percent chance of having solved those issues. To really have a 100 percent chance, it requires the design iteration on the engine. And part of it was that we had to discover that we needed to tighten the bolts that attached the thrust chamber to the injector head after firing. So after the first firing, it turns out that's what caused some of the bolts to loosen a little bit; like some of them, some of the time, would loosen and that would allow basically fuel and gas to combine. Because the seal that normally blocks the passage of the fuel and oxidizer would gap a little bit, and it only takes a tiny amount of fuel and oxygen combining in a bad spot to explode the engine. Ars:You mentioned the tiles. Is upper-stage reentry the biggest technical problem standing in the way of getting to a fully, rapidly reusable Starship? Musk: Yeah. I mean, we've proven booster re-flight many times. Now this is a more efficient re-flight of booster, because the booster is literally coming back, getting caught by the tower, and being placed on the launch stand. That is much more efficient than landing on a droneship with legs, and then the ship's got to come back into port. That takes several days, and there are dozens of small things about Falcon 9 that need to be refurbished between flights. It's a pretty quick refurbishment, but it takes a few days, whereas Starship booster is designed for immediate re-flight. So it literally comes back, and in principle, less than 10 minutes later, you can be refilling propellant on the booster. Ars:You mentioned upgraded engines solving the problem with Starship's upper stage. What's the timeline on flying Raptor 3 engines? Musk: That's end of the year. The upgraded Raptors have a complete redesign of the aft end of the booster and the ship. So, because we don't need the heat shield around the upper portion of the engine, it greatly simplifies the base of the booster and the ship. It'll look a little, frankly, naked, especially on the booster side, because the engines will just be there, like, not with stuff around them. If you look at the current design, you can see the nozzles, but you can't see the thrust chamber and the turbopump, because each one of those are in basically an individually fire-walled cell. But Raptor 3 is designed to not require a heat shield around the thrust chamber and turbopump. And that's part of what makes it so clean. And this is a design change that I really had to push the team very hard to do, to get rid of any secondary structure, and any parts that could get burned off because there will be no heat shield. So it'll be very clear when we have a Raptor 3. Version 3 of the Ship and Booster has quite a radical redesign. Ars:Ten years ago you kind of made big bets on Starship and Starlink, and most people probably expected one or both of them to fail. Musk: Including me. Ars:Yeah. These were huge bets. Musk: I was interviewed in the early days of Starlink, and they were asking me what's the goal of Starlink? I said goal number one: don't go bankrupt, as every other [low-Earth orbit] communications constellation has gone bankrupt, and we don't want to join them in the cemetery. So any outcome that does not result in death would be a good outcome. Ars:Starlink has become really successful. It helped me during a hurricane. And Starship is coming along. As you look out for the next 10 years, what are you betting on big now that will really bear fruit for SpaceX a decade from now? Musk: Well, by far the biggest thing is Starship. If the Starship program is successful—and we see a path to success, it's just a question of when we will have created the first fully reusable orbital launch vehicle, which is the holy grail of rocketry, as you know. So no one has ever made a fully reusable orbital vehicle, and even the parts that have been reusable have been extremely arduous to reuse, such that the economics actually were worse than an expendable rocket in a lot of cases. The canonical example being the shuttle, where the shuttle's fully loaded, cost of the whole program, I believe, was about a billion dollars a flight. Ars:I sawone research paperthat estimated the fully loaded cost was about $1.5 billion. Musk. Yeah. And that is roughly equivalent to a Saturn V cost. But the Saturn V as an expendable rocket had four times the payload capacity of the shuttle. So the shuttle was like the principle of reusability was good one, but the execution, unfortunately, was not. The shuttle got burdened by so many crazy requirements. You know, I've got this five-step first principles process thing for making things better. And step one of my five-step process is make the requirements less dumb. And for the government, it's the opposite. The government is making requirements more dumb. Ars:So getting a rapid and reusable Starship is the main goal for SpaceX over the next 5 to 10 years? Musk: Yeah, absolutely. Ars:You've been in the space industry now for almost 25 years. And in that time, SpaceX has gone a long way toward solving launch. So if you were coming into the industry today as a 20-something, you know, with a couple $100 million. What would be the problem you would want to solve? What should new companies, philanthropists, and others be working on in space? Musk: We're building the equivalent of the Union Pacific Railroad and the train. So once you have the transportation system to Mars, then there's a vast set of opportunities that open up to do anything on the surface of Mars, which includes, you know, doing everything from building a semiconductor fab to a pizza joint, basically building a civilization. So we want to solve the transport problem and that can enable philanthropists and entrepreneurs to do things on Mars, which is everything needed for civilization. Look at, say, California. There were very few people in California until the Union Pacific was completed, and then California became the most populous state in the nation. And look at Silicon Valley and Hollywood and everything. So that's our goal. We want to get people there, and if we can get people there, then there's a literal world of opportunity. Ars:NASA is focused on Artemis and going back to the Moon. I think you have mixed feelings, perhaps, about that program. Musk: Yeah, I think its ambitions are too low. Ars:So does it matter to you if China gets back to the Moon before the United States? Do you care about that? Musk: I think the United States should be aiming for Mars, because we've already actually been to the Moon several times. Yeah, if China sort of equals that, I'm like, okay, sure, but that's something that America did 56 years ago. If you look at the Apollo program, when JFK gave that famous speech, it was about setting a target that's far in excess of what had been done. It wasn't, like, let's do what the Russians already did. Ars:Right. JFK wanted to accomplish something far beyond what the Soviets did. Musk:We should be going 1,000 times further, and going to Mars. Mars is 1,000 times further than the Moon. And if we are gonna go to the Moon, I think we should do a Moon base, or something that's the next level beyond Apollo. Ars:You've you spent the last year pretty heavily focused on politics. I'm wondering if you feel like that has slowed SpaceX down or harmed SpaceX? Musk: I think I probably did spend a bit too much time on politics, it's less than people would think, because the media is going to over-represent any political stuff, because political bones of contention get a lot of traction in the media. It's not like I left the companies. It was just relative time allocation that probably was a little too high on the government side, and I've reduced that significantly in recent weeks.

    "title": "Hidden AI instructions reveal how Anthropic controls Claude 4",
    "article_text": "Expert analysis shows Anthropic's attempts to skip chatbot praise and avoid copyrighted content. On Sunday, independent AI researcherSimon Willisonpublished adetailed analysisof Anthropic's newly released system prompts for Claude 4's Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 models, offering insights into how Anthropic controls the models' \"behavior\" through their outputs. Willison examined both the published prompts and leaked internal tool instructions to reveal what he calls \"a sort of unofficial manual for how best to use these tools.\" To understand what Willison is talking about, we'll need to explain what system prompts are. Large language models (LLMs) like the AI models that run Claude and ChatGPT process an input called a \"prompt\" and return an output that is the most likely continuation of that prompt. System prompts are instructions that AI companies feed to the models before each conversation to establish how they should respond. Unlike the messages users see from the chatbot, system prompts typically remain hidden from the user and tell the model its identity, behavioral guidelines, and specific rules to follow. Each time a user sends a message, the AI model receives the full conversation history along with the system prompt, allowing it to maintain context while following its instructions. While Anthropicpublishesportions of its system prompts in its release notes, Willison's analysis reveals these published versions are incomplete. The full system prompts, which include detailed instructions for tools like web search and code generation, must be extracted through techniques like prompt injection—methods that trick the model into revealing its hidden instructions. Willison relied on leaked prompts gathered by researchers who used such techniques to obtain the complete picture of how Claude 4 operates. For example, even though LLMs aren't people, they can reproduce human-like outputs due to their training data that includes many examples of emotional interactions. Willison shows that Anthropic includes instructions for the models to provide emotional support while avoiding encouragement for self-destructive behavior. Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4 receive identical instructions to \"care about people's wellbeing and avoid encouraging or facilitating self-destructive behaviors such as addiction, disordered or unhealthy approaches to eating or exercise.\" Willison, whocoinedthe term \"prompt injection\" in 2022, is always on the lookout for LLM vulnerabilities. In his post, he notes that reading system prompts reminds him of warning signs in the real world that hint at past problems. \"A system prompt can often be interpreted as a detailed list of all of the things the model used to do before it was told not to do them,\" he writes. Credit:alashi via Getty Images Willison's analysis comes as AI companies grapple with sycophantic behavior in their models. As wereportedin April, ChatGPT users have complained about GPT-4o's \"relentlessly positive tone\" and excessive flattery since OpenAI's March update. Users described feeling \"buttered up\" by responses like \"Good question! You're very astute to ask that,\" with software engineer Craig Weiss tweeting that \"ChatGPT is suddenly the biggest suckup I've ever met.\" The issue stems from how companies collect user feedback during training—people tend to prefer responses that make them feel good, creating a feedback loop where models learn that enthusiasm leads to higher ratings from humans. As a response to the feedback, OpenAI later rolled back ChatGPT's 4o model and altered the system prompt as well, somethingwe reported onand Willisonalso analyzedat the time. One of Willison's most interesting findings about Claude 4 relates to how Anthropic has guided both Claude models to avoid sycophantic behavior. \"Claude never starts its response by saying a question or idea or observation was good, great, fascinating, profound, excellent, or any other positive adjective,\" Anthropic writes in the prompt. \"It skips the flattery and responds directly.\" The Claude 4 system prompt also includes extensive instructions on when Claude should or shouldn't use bullet points and lists, with multiple paragraphs dedicated to discouraging frequent list-making in casual conversation. \"Claude should not use bullet points or numbered lists for reports, documents, explanations, or unless the user explicitly asks for a list or ranking,\" the prompt states. Willison discovered discrepancies in Claude's stated knowledge cutoff date, noting that while Anthropic's comparison table lists March 2025 as the training data cutoff, the system prompt states January 2025 as the models' \"reliable knowledge cutoff date.\" He speculates this might help avoid situations where Claude confidently answers questions based on incomplete information from later months. Willison also emphasizes the extensive copyright \"protections\" built into Claude's search capabilities. Both models receive repeated instructions to use only one short quote (under 15 words) from web sources per response and to avoid creating what the prompt calls \"displacive summaries.\" The instructions specify that Claude should use only one short quote per response and explicitly refuse requests to reproduce song lyrics \"in ANY form.\" Thefull postincludes more analysis. Willison concludes that these system prompts serve as valuable documentation for understanding how to maximize these tools' capabilities. \"If you're an LLM power-user, the above system prompts are solid gold for figuring out how to best take advantage of these tools,\" he writes. Willison also calls on Anthropic and others to be more transparent about their system prompts, beyond publishing excerpts as Anthropic currently does: \"I wish Anthropic would take the next step and officially publish the prompts for their tools to accompany their open system prompts,\" he writes. \"I’d love to see other vendors follow the same path as well.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Trump signs executive orders meant to resurrect US nuclear power",
    "article_text": "Plan calls for three new reactors to reach criticality in about a year. Currently, there are no nuclear power plants scheduled for construction in the US. Everybody with plans to build one hasn't had a reactor design approved, while nobody is planning to use any of the approved designs. This follows a period in which only three new reactors have entered service since 1990. Despite its extremely low carbon footprint, nuclear power appears to be dead in the water. On Friday, the Trump administration issued a series of executive orders intended to revive the US nuclear industry. These include plans to streamline the reactor approval process and boost the construction of experimental reactors by the Department of Energy. But they also contain language that's inconsistent with other administration priorities and fundamentally misunderstands the use of nuclear power. Plus, some timelines might be, shall we say, unrealistic: three new experimental reactors reaching criticality in just over a year. The heyday of nuclear plant construction in the US was in the 1970s and 80s. But the 1979partial meltdownat the Three Mile Island plant soured public sentiment toward nuclear power. This also came at a time when nuclear plants typically generatedonly half of their rated capacity, making them an expensive long-term bet. As a result, plans for many plants, including some that were partially constructed, were canceled. In this century, only four new reactors on existing plant sites have started construction, and two of those have since been cancelled due to delays and spiralling costs. The two reactors that have entered service also suffered considerable delays and cost overruns. While safety regulations are often blamed for the construction costs,researchers who studied construction recordsfound that many delays simply arose from workers being idled while they awaited equipment or the completion of other work on the site. This may indicate that the lack of a well-developed supply chain for reactor parts is a significant contributor. And the last major changes in safety regulations came in response to theFukushima meltdown and explosions, which identified key vulnerabilities in traditional designs. A large number of startups have proposed designs that should be far less prone to failure. Many of these are SMRs, or small modular reactors, which promise economies of scale by building the reactor at a central facility and then shipping it to the site of installation. But, as of yet, only a single reactor of this type has been approved in the US, and the only planned installation of that designwas canceledas the projected cost of its electricity became uncompetitive. That environment makes investing in nuclear power extremely risky on its own. However, we're also at a time when the prices of natural gas, wind, and especially solar are incredibly low, making it challenging to justify the large up-front costs of nuclear power, along with the long lead time before it starts generating returns on those costs. That's the situation the Trump administration hopes to change, though you can question the sincerity of that effort. To start, the executive orders were issued on the Friday before a holiday weekend, typically the time reserved for news that you hope nobody pays attention to. One of the announcements also refers to nuclear power as dispatchable (meaning it can be ramped up and down quickly), which it most certainly isn't. Finally, it touts nuclear power as avoiding the risks associated with other forms of power, \"such as pollution with potentially deleterious health effects.\" Elsewhere, however, the administration is eliminating pollution regulations and promoting the use of high-pollution fuels, such as coal. Overall, the actions proposed in the new executive orders range from the fanciful to the potentially reasonable. For example, the \"Reinvigorating the Nuclear Industrial Base\" order calls for the development of the capacity to reprocess spent nuclear fuel to obtain useful fuel from it, a process that's extremely expensive compared to simply mining new fuel, and would only make nuclear power less economically viable. It also calls for recommendations regarding permanent storage of any remaining waste, an issue that has remained unresolved for decades. Mixed in with that are more sensible recommendations about ensuring the capacity to enrich isotopes to the purities needed to fuel power plants. The order also calls for the Department of Energy (DOE) to provide financial support for the industry to boost construction of new plants, something the agency already does through a loan guarantee program. Even though those guarantees have not resulted in new construction plans in over a decade, the EO calls for the effort to result in \"10 new large reactors with complete designs under construction by 2030.\" While the Biden administration had approved payments to keep nuclear plants open, Trump is calling for funding to be used to reopen some plants that had been unable to operate economically—something that has not been done in the US previously. It also calls for money to go to restart construction at sites where reactors were canceled, although only two of those are less than decades old. Similar unrealistic time scales are present in the \"Deploying Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies\" order. This is intended to encourage some of the proposed designs for SMRs and inherently safe reactors that are currently on the drawing board. It directs the Army to install one of these at a military base that will be operating within the next three years. And it directs the secretary of energy to contract with companies to build three test reactors that will sustain a nuclear reaction by July 4, 2026. The accelerated schedule is expected to come from enabling the secretary of energy to simply ignore any aspect of the environmental review that the companies building the reactor complain about: \"The Secretary shall, consistent with applicable law, use all available authorities to eliminate or expedite the Department’s environmental reviews for authorizations, permits, approvals, leases, and any other activity requested by an applicant or potential applicant.\" The other big executive order targets theNuclear Regulatory Commission(NRC), which approves license designs. The order blames this on how the NRC is structured: \"The NRC charges applicants by the hour to process license applications, with prolonged timelines that maximize fees while throttling nuclear power development.\" It also criticizes the commission's regulations as being based on the idea that there is no safe level of exposure to radiation, though it provides no evidence that the idea is wrong. This is said to result in regulations that attempt to lower exposures below those caused by a natural environment. The order attempts to accelerate the approval process enough to ensure that the US goes from 100 GW of generating capacity to 400 GW by 2050. This is largely done by setting hard time limits on the approval process through consultations with DOGE, including a limit of 18 months for approval of new nuclear plants. It also calls for the adoption of \"science-based radiation limits,\" claiming that flaws with existing limits had been discussed earlier—even though the earlier discussion made no mention of scientific flaws. In keeping with plans for mass production of modular reactors, the order also calls for a single certification process for these designs, focusing solely on site differences once the general reactor design is accepted as safe. Overall, there are some reasonable ideas scattered throughout the executive orders (though whether their implementation ends up being reasonable is questionable, especially given DOGE's involvement). But the majority of them are based on the idea that regulation is the primary reason for nuclear energy's atrophy in the US. The reality is that an underdeveloped supply chain and unfavorable economics are far larger factors. It's difficult to justify investing in a plant that might take a decade to start selling power when the up-front costs of solar are far smaller, and it can start producing power while still under construction. The most likely way to see a nuclear resurgence in the US is for the government to pay for the plants itself. There's a small bit of that here, in the call for the DOE to fund the construction of experimental reactors at third-party sites. But it's not enough to significantly shift the trajectory of US nuclear power. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "NPR sues Trump over blocked funding, says it may have to shutter newsrooms",
    "article_text": "Trump move \"is textbook retaliation and viewpoint-based discrimination,\" NPR says. National Public Radio sued President Trump and his administration today over Trump's move toblock fundingfor public broadcasting. NPR said Trump acted illegally, and that losing federal funding could force it to shut newsrooms and dramatically scale back news coverage. On May 1, Trump issued anexecutive ordertitled, \"Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Biased Media,\" in which he ordered the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and all US agencies to cease federal funding for NPR and PBS. The White House had previouslyallegedthat NPR and PBS \"spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news.'\" NPR'slawsuitin US District Court for the District of Columbia asked the court to declare Trump's executive order and all actions to implement it unconstitutional. NPR's lawsuit said that Trump \"has no authority under the Constitution to take such action. On the contrary, the power of the purse is reserved to Congress, and the President has no inherent authority to override Congress's will on domestic spending decisions. By unilaterally imposing restrictions and conditions on funds in contravention of Congress, the Order violates the Separation of Powers and the Spending Clause of the Constitution.\" Trump violated the First Amendment, the lawsuit said. \"The Order is textbook retaliation and viewpoint-based discrimination in violation of the First Amendment, and it interferes with NPR's and the Local Member Stations' freedom of expressive association and editorial discretion,\" NPR wrote. \"By basing its directives on the content and perceived viewpoints expressed in NPR's programming, the Order puts NPR on notice that, if it is ever to receive federal funding again, it must adapt its journalistic and editorial choices to suit the government's preferences,\" the lawsuit also said. NPR was joined in the lawsuit by three Colorado-based stations that receive federal funding. Trump's executive order said that public radio and television stations may not use federal funds to buy NPR and PBS programming. Besides Trump, the defendants named in the lawsuit include the Office of Management and Budget, the Treasury Department, the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), and the CPB. The lawsuit seeks orders preventing the NEA and CPB from withholding funding based on the executive order. NPR and the local stations \"bring this action to challenge an Executive Order that violates the expressed will of Congress and the First Amendment's bedrock guarantees of freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of association, and also threatens the existence of a public radio system that millions of Americans across the country rely on for vital news and information,\" the lawsuit said. Congress appropriated $535 million in general funding for the CPB in fiscal years 2025, 2026, and 2027, the lawsuit said. \"NPR is funded primarily through sponsorships, donations from individuals and private entities, membership and licensing fees from local public radio stations, direct funding from the Corporation, and direct funding from other government grants, including grants awarded by the NEA,\" the lawsuit said. NPR said the loss of federal funding and fees from stations that would otherwise acquire programming from NPR \"would be catastrophic\" to the organization. NPR receives about 31 percent of its operating revenue through membership fees and licensing fees from local stations \"and additional millions of dollars from CPB to support NPR's coverage of particular issue areas, such as the ongoing war in Ukraine,\" the lawsuit said. The loss of funding could force NPR \"to shutter or downsize collaborative newsrooms and rural reporting initiatives,\" and \"eliminate or scale back critical national and international coverage that serves the entire public radio system and is not replicable at scale on the local level,\" the lawsuit said. The NEA terminated a grant award to NPR one day after Trump's executive order, the lawsuit said. \"This termination confirms that NEA is complying with the Order and has rendered NPR ineligible to apply for grants going forward,\" the lawsuit said. One legal problem with the executive order, according to NPR, is that it \"purports to require the Corporation to prohibit local stations from using CPB grants to acquire NPR's programming, notwithstanding a statutory requirement that stations must use 'restricted' funds to acquire or produce programming that is distributed nationally and serves the needs of national audiences.\" Local stations would be forced \"to redirect those funds to acquire different national programming—in contravention of their own editorial choices—and to take additional, non-federal funds out of their budgets to continue acquiring NPR's programming,\" the lawsuit said.

    "title": "Cops arrest third suspect accused of brutally torturing man for bitcoin riches",
    "article_text": "So-called \"wrench attacks\" are more common as bitcoin's value increases, reports say. Police have arrested a third suspect linked to one of the most extreme bitcoin-related kidnapping and torture cases in the United States, The New York Timesreported. The arrest came after an Italian man, Michael Valentino Teofrasto Carturan, escaped a luxury Manhattan townhouse after three weeks of alleged imprisonment. Running to a traffic agent for help, he later told police that he was tortured by colleagues for his bitcoin password, \"bound with electrical cords and whipped with a gun,\" his feet submerged in water while a Taser gun sent jolts through his body, the NYT reported. At times he feared for his life—allegedly once held suspended from the ledge of the fifth-story building—but he seemingly never gave up his password, a resistance that only prompted more extreme violence. Police raided the townhouse and found photos depicting the torture, as well as \"several guns, a ballistic vest, and broken furniture,\" the NYT reported. Two butlers onsite agreed to be interviewed. Cops soon after arrested two suspects—John Woeltz, 37, and Beatrice Folchi, 24—but were still seeking an \"unapprehended male,\" the NYT previouslyreported. Folchi was released after her prosecution was deferred, but Woeltz was held without bail after being charged with assault, kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment, and criminal possession of a gun, the NYT reported. On Tuesday morning, 33-year-old William Duplessie surrendered to police after days of negotiations, Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch told the NYT. Like Woeltz, he faces charges of kidnapping and false imprisonment, Tisch confirmed. According to Carturan, he met Woeltz through a crypto hedge fund in New York, but they quickly had a falling out over money, prompting Carturan to return home to Italy. But Woeltz apparently convinced Carturan to come back to New York, inviting him to the townhouse, where Carturan alleged he was immediately assaulted by Woeltz and Duplessie. Stealing his electronic devices, they hoped to swipe millions in bitcoin, Carturan alleged, by torturing him and threatening to do the same to his family. As police mount their case against Woeltz and Duplessie, several outlets report that these so-called \"wrench attacks\"—where bad actors physically attack cryptocurrency holders as brutally as possible to get access to their wallets—are increasingly common globally. As cryptocurrency holders fear online hacks, a growing trend of storing wallet keys on physical devices that cannot be hacked is likely driving the assaults, experts suggest. Asbitcoin's value has recently hit record highs, it has only further incentivized the thefts. Sometimes criminals locate targets through data breaches targeting cryptocurrency exchanges, the WSJ noted. Earlier this month, Ars notedat least five crypto-related abductions, some involving severed fingers, over a few months in France, as well as cases where family members were targeted. Some cases appear to be related, The Wall Street Journalreported, including a Florida man suspected of leading a criminal ring intent on robbing cryptocurrency riches through a string of home invasions across multiple states. Some criminals are so bold as to attempt assaults using toy guns, the WSJ noted. Duplessie \"has connections to Switzerland and Miami,\" the NYT reported, but not much else is known about his involvement. Woeltz was apparently well-known in certain US crypto circles. He once served as managing director of Silicon River Capital, an investment fund focused on blockchain technology. And currently, he is an advisor to a Kentucky state office of technology working group, helping lawmakers \"use block chain technology to protect natural gas pipelines, telecommunications and other infrastructure,\" the NYT reported.

    "title": "After the LA fires, scientists study the toxic hazards left behind",
    "article_text": "Researchers are studying the long-term effects on air, water, soils and surfaces of properties that didn’t burn. This article originally appeared onInside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy, and the environment. Sign up for their newsletterhere. PASADENA, Calif.—Nicole Byrne watched anxiously from across the small kitchen in her home as Parham Azimi, a Harvard University researcher, lined up sample bottles next to the running tap. As his phone timer chimed, indicating the water pipes had been flushed for the required five minutes, Azimi began filling collection bottles and packing them to be mailed to a lab in San Diego later that day. Byrne knew it would take weeks to get results back for most of the samples, but she was finally one step closer to answers. Although her home is nearly two miles from Altadena, one of two communities devastated by the wildfires that broke out in Los Angeles on January 7, the rented bungalow on Loma Vista Street in Pasadena was located downwind of the burn zone. Byrne, a therapist and mother of two preschoolers, and her husband, Jonathan Hull, a Ph.D. chemist, knew “too much for comfort” about toxic environmental exposure, said Byrne, “but without a good way to get answers.” Azimi was there gathering water samples as part of an unprecedented academic collaboration led by health, environmental, data, and wildfire risk assessment researchers at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, the University of California, Davis, and the University of Texas at Austin. With support from the Spiegel Family Fund, the universities formed the LA Fire Health Study Consortium in late January after the fires killed 29 people, destroyed more than 16,000 structures, primarily in Altadena and Pacific Palisades, and exposed millions to particulate matter, gases, chemicals, heavy metals, asbestos, PFAS, microplastics and other toxic pollutants. The consortium pledged a 10-year study but also committed to providing Los Angeles with health information in real time, which became critically important after the US Army Corps of Engineers said in early February that it wouldn’t conduct soil sampling after the fires. Azimi was among scientists studying toxic harms in the burn zone to 50 undamaged homes’ soil, air, drinking water and dust. Others would perform mobile air and surface water testing, monitor firefighters’ health, assess combustible “fuel stocks”—everything from trees and brush to homes, vehicles, fencing, decks and especially anything plastic, in urban and woodland areas—and employ a computer model to estimate how much smoke entered 14 million homes in Southern California. Joseph Allen, director of the Harvard Healthy Buildings Program at the Chan School and a consortium leader, said university scientists immediately descended on LA even before funding for the consortium emerged. “In these national emergencies, I think all of us in this field feel compelled to do what we can to help,” he said. Chris Olivares Martinez, an aquatic pollution researcher down Interstate 5 at the University of California Irvine who also became part of the 50-home study, hopes the consortium will serve as a model for academic institutions to build a more collaborative framework for scientific research. “These disasters are happening so quickly, and they wreak havoc in so many domains,” he said. Azimi, working in Nicole Byrne’s Pasadena kitchen, labeled and packed his last water sample for shipping back to Harvard. Then he carefully removed two sets of indicator strips from a test kit and dunked them in and out of the final specimen container for 20 seconds before moving on to run a second set of test strips under the tap for another 20 seconds. When Byrne asked how long the family would have to wait to start getting results back, she was startled when Azimi said the first two of the several hundred water quality tests would be ready in less than a minute. “The H2S was basically zero, which we’ve seen in lots of homes,” a good sign, said Azimi, referring to a test of hydrogen sulfide that’s intended to detect bacteria of fecal origin. But among the houses tested so far, Byrne’s had among the highest levels of both free and total chlorine, which typically come from water treatment efforts aimed at disinfecting organic carbon, ash and sediment deposited by the fires. Although the news was bad—the level was above the 4 parts per million threshold set by the Environmental Protection Agency—Azimi had provided Byrne with her first bit of knowledge to keep her family safe. As an indoor air quality researcher, Azimi, 37, never could have predicted he would be responsible for water sampling here in Los Angeles when he took a research position at the Harvard Healthy Buildings Program back in 2019. At the time, Azimi’s research was focused on infectious disease transmission models, and he had every expectation it would remain in the lab. But then, just months after starting at Harvard, news broke of a measles outbreak spreading in Brooklyn. “‘Hey, Parham, just stop everything, clear your table and just focus on measles outbreaks in schools,’” he recalled Joe Allen, head of the Healthy Buildings Program, telling him. “So that was my first response to a crisis, and then quickly after that, COVID happened.” Azimi was still a little sheepish thinking back on the media circus that ensued in July 2020 when his team published the first credible mathematical model illustrating that COVID-19 was airborne based on data from the Diamond Princess cruise. “Then it was in the New York Times and suddenly it was everywhere,” said Azimi. And so he has spent the last six years searching for answers in the wake of disasters—after COVID came Hurricane Ida, then Hurricane Ian and then the Lahaina wildfire on Maui. “All of a sudden, all of these crises happened, and they were all related to indoor air quality,” Azimi said. “It’s kind of defined my research.” He’s been accompanied throughout these travels by his wife, 37-year-old Iranian-American engineer Zahra Keshavarz, who also works in the Harvard Healthy Buildings Program indoor air quality lab. The couple met as second-year university students in Iran, and have been together ever since, even making it through a five-year long distance relationship when Azimi left Iran in 2012 to pursue his Ph.D. at the Illinois Institute of Technology. The couple were married in 2017, when Keshavarz joined Azimi in Chicago, where he had accepted a two-year postdoctoral position. Keshavarz spent the next two years working as an indoor air quality consultant at an environmental services company in Chicago. Her experience both testing and analyzing indoor air quality would prove invaluable as she transitioned to the Harvard team. In January 2022, Azimi and Keshavarz got a National Science Foundation (NSF) Rapid Response Research grant to inspect the mold growth after flooding and hurricanes, less than six months after Hurricane Ida hit New Orleans and then made its way north before deluging Philadelphia, New Jersey and New York City with massive rainfall. Azimi and Keshavarz did their testing a few months after the hurricane, “so everything was open and dry and clean,” Azimi said. “But in that project, our research focus was on the longer terms of the impacts of these hurricanes. We wanted to show the homes that were affected, even a few months after, still have mold problems.” In total, the couple visited and took samples at 60 homes, spending three weeks in New Orleans and another two in New York and New Jersey. The winter of 2022-23 saw the couple on the road again, this time in Florida, a few months behind the devastation of Hurricane Ian. With their NSF grant funding expanded by 20 percent, they were able to add an additional 60 test sites in Miami, Orlando and Fort Lauderdale to see the lingering effects of mold growth in Florida’s tropical climate. Though always cautious, Keshavarz was extra careful during this field excursion, using even higher levels of personal protective equipment than the situation would normally require: she was pregnant with their first child, a daughter they named Alyssa. Their baby wasn’t even three months old in August 2023 when wildfire swept through Lahaina, devastating the picturesque Maui town and killing more than 100 residents, making it the deadliest wildfire in modern U.S. history. Over the course of the next four months, Keshavarz and Azimi juggled their roles as exhausted new parents and scientists whose research hinged on timely response in a crisis. The couple arrived in Maui on Jan. 1, 2024, along with several trunks of equipment and their 6-month-old daughter. Keshavarz’s parents came along to care for their infant granddaughter when Azimi and Keshavarz were in the field. The fires were still burning in Altadena and Pacific Palisades when the Spiegel Family Fund invited Allen and Azimi to LA on January 11 to discuss the funding and logistics of the consortium, which was formally announced January 30. When Harvard’s Chan School issued the press release, an environmental chemistry postdoc was giving Azimi a crash course in water sampling at the utility sink in the garage of his Boston home. The couple left 18 hours later for LA, arriving on January 31, the day the fires were finally contained. The consortium’s cross-institutional and interdisciplinary design meant Azimi and Keshavarz would have to take soil, air, water, residue, and ash samples at any of the 50 houses enrolled in the environmental exposure study on undamaged houses in the vicinity of the burn zone. At times they were responsible for sampling for as many as six different labs at four separate universities around the country. Some required multiple types of samples, such as both ash and water, or multiple samples of the same kind collected in different ways or kept in different containers. Altogether, each house required dozens of samples, each taken following the exact methodology required by the lab it would be sent to, which would in turn be subjected to hundreds of tests. Three weeks into their work, the consortium released its first public data brief, announcing that particulate matter air pollution in Altadena and the Palisades was generally within EPA limits but could vary significantly based on the time of day, direction of the wind, and other atmospheric conditions. Olivares, the UC Irvine water pollution researcher who often worked side by side with Azimi gathering samples in homes, said in early March that he had been finding much lower levels of benzene and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) than he had expected—and feared—based on the levels found after the 2018 Camp Fire that destroyed Paradise, California. This is partially thanks to the hard-won lessons in Paradise, where residents complained for months about the foul odor of the tap water before the water company finally agreed to test and found toxic levels of benzene throughout the water system, Olivares said. In both the Palisades and Altadena, as soon as the fires were contained, the water companies spent a full week flushing the water lines in an effort to prevent any contaminants from the fires from settling on the bottom of pipes or penetrating into chemically permeable PVC, Olivares said. Only after a full week of intensely flushing the system did the water companies then begin testing at hydrants throughout the burn zone. But the preliminary results weren’t all so positive. In its second data brief on March 5, the consortium reported that indoor air quality in homes that suffered fire damage can be diminished for weeks. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) inside damaged homes were four to five times higher than levels outside, and spikes in VOCs and particle pollution could result from cleaning and other indoor activity. In mid-March, the consortium reported in its third data brief that during the fires, particulate matter (PM) air pollution was elevated in homes that were located more than two miles from the burn area. The scientists recommended monitoring indoor air quality, wearing masks and using air filters. Driving down E. Mendocino Street in Altadena on April 1, Azimi and Keshavarz saw scant visual evidence of the conflagration that came tearing down from Eaton Canyon in January. They parked their rented Volkswagen Atlas in front of Timothy Bartlett and Tamara Mnoian’s house but struggled to introduce themselves over the deafening clang of heavy machinery as the Army Corps of Engineers worked to clear burned lots a block and a half away. Bartlett and Mnoian’s home was nestled deep in the burn zone but through a stroke of luck remained standing. The two-story Spanish-style home from the 1920s sits at the edge of a bubble of more than 50 homes that were unburned by the flames that encircled their West Altadena neighborhood. Bartlett, a film editor in his late 40s, has spent the last four years making the house at the corner of Mendocino and Catherine the perfect home for himself and Mnoian. Late last fall, the couple welcomed a daughter. Now, in the midst of juggling busy careers and life as new parents, they are having to contend with a highly contaminated house and prolonged displacement to protect themselves. Bartlett is especially concerned about the exposure risks for their daughter. Before she was born, he spent much of his more than 20-year career in Hollywood alternating between high-paying reality TV editing jobs and science-focused documentaries. “I’d work the [reality TV] job until I had enough of a cushion that I could say yes the next time someone told me, ‘Look, I have this project. There’s no money, but it means something.’” Since his daughter’s birth, Bartlett has been prioritizing the relative stability of his reality TV editing jobs, especially since the Eaton Fire has thrown yet another layer of chaos into the mix. Keshavarz understood his desire for stability. She and Azimi were counting down the days until they could go home to Boston. The family changed hotels six times during their stay in LA, alternating between Santa Monica and Pasadena so they would always be close to one set of test sites. As Azimi set up the air sampler that would run inside the Bartlett-Mnoian home for the next week, Keshavarz took a turn in the cramped back seat of the Atlas with Alyssa. Squished between boxes of equipment for the field research team and Alyssa’s car seat, Keshavarz tried to entice her daughter with fruit snacks and goldfish crackers. Emma Landskroner pulled up to the house on Mendocino just as Azimi and Keshavarz were tucking the last box of water samples into the large cooler in the SUV’s overstuffed trunk. The couple stripped off respirators and tucked soiled boot covers and gloves into sealed bags to be tossed out later. They had to dash off to the post office before it closed to get the water samples they had taken that day to both the San Diego and Harvard labs by the next morning. The trip out of the burn zone also meant Alyssa would have a few minutes to run around outside without risking exposure. As Azimi and Keshavarz drove off, Landskroner made her way over to introduce herself to Bartlett and Mnoian. Landskroner, 26, a Ph.D candidate at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, works in the lab of Candice Tsai, whose nanoparticle research relies on the use of a sampler she invented that must run for a full week to collect reliable results. For Landskroner, exposure science is personal. When, despite no family history of the disease, Landskroner’s father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in her senior year of college, it motivated her to look more deeply at a future in public health and preventive medicine research. Between working on experiments for her dissertation and the other research Landskroner does as part of the Tsai Lab, she barely got six hours of sleep a night even before the LA fires forced the evacuation of UCLA. Since the fires, she calls it a win when she gets four hours a night. Landskroner does a good job of hiding her exhaustion, the only sign a quickly stifled yawn as she zips up her Bruins hoodie. Tall and athletic with her thick dark hair pulled up in a high ponytail to avoid snagging it on the respirator straps, she offered a quick yet warm smile as she double-checked her mask before heading into the house. “People deserve to know what they are being exposed to, and I have the tools to help them find out,” she said. “We saw after 9/11, even those who weren’t immediately exposed during the building collapse, but months after, the people who just lived in the area during the cleanup, there was heightened cancer mortality among them… Now there’s some interesting studies that everything we’re seeing here is likely comparable to the same particulates and exposures that happened during the World Trade Center.” Bartlett and Mnoian are similarly serious about the health implications not just for themselves, but for their infant daughter should they return to the house on Mendocino Street. The couple still doesn’t have a timeline for returning home. They finally got an appointment with an adjuster on their insurance company’s approved vendor list earlier the day Landskroner visited. They still had no idea of how big a gap there would be between what their insurance offered, and the actual price to have their property fully remediated. In the meantime they hoped the consortium could provide some answers, if not about the cleanup, then at least about just how toxic their home was in the wake of the fires. Landskroner finished setting up the device for measuring nanoparticles, and let the couple know Azimi and Keshavarz would be back to collect the equipment in a week. Early in April, the consortium released its fifth databrief, which explained that air pollution levels remained higher indoors than outdoors in the days and weeks after the fires, likely due to smoke absorbed by porous surfaces like drywall and soft goods. Scientists recommended that residents run high efficiency particulate air filters and activated charcoal air purifiers before reoccupying fire-affected residences. “Why wouldn’t a university in Boston try to help out when LA has a crisis?” asked Allen, of the Chan School, regarding Harvard’s involvement in the consortium. “Certainly, we know when Boston has a crisis, our colleagues around the country help us. When New York has a crisis, everyone mobilizes to help New York. If Texas has a crisis, we all mobilize to help Texas.” “I’m in the field of public health,” he added. “That’s everybody everywhere. So I think it’s natural that we run towards people who need help.” To Azimi, it is no surprise that a disaster this strange and on this scale in one of the major cultural capitals of the United States sparked such a sprawling and diverse scientific collaboration. Of course everyone felt called to take part. “LA is the second-largest city in the United States, and this affected millions of people,” said Azimi, who arrived back in Boston with his wife and daughter on April 15. “More recently, we are getting urban fires. And unfortunately, we saw two large ones back to back in the same city.” The true test of the collaboration will be if it can continue, and if future, more predictable disasters like hurricanes, can generate the same kind of scientific momentum. “The first thing we have to do is put aside our egos and say, ‘No, we are still vulnerable to nature and the power of nature, and we have to consider it seriously,’” Azimi said. “I already have seen this in academia; having all these teams sharing data and resources gives you credibility.” Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Musi says evidence shows Apple conspired with music industry on App Store ban",
    "article_text": "Both Musi and Apple seek sanctions as fight over App Store removal intensifies. For millions of music fans, the most controversial app ban of the past year was not thebrief TikTok outagebut the ongoing delisting of Musi from Apple's App Store. Those users are holding out hope that Musi can defeat Apple in court and soon be reinstated. However, rather than coming to any sort of resolution, that court fight has intensified over the past month, with both sides now seeking sanctions, TorrentFreakreported. Musi is a free app that lets users stream music from YouTube without interruptions, only playing ads when the app is initially opened. It was removed from the App Store in September 2024 after a YouTube complaint, but it maintains adeeply loyal fan basewho swear it's better than alternatives like Spotify. Those fans who still have the app installed on their iPhones can continue to use the service, but if they lose access to the app (by updating their phones) or are first-time users, it is currently unavailable for download, to the dismay of many fans who complain dailyon Reddit. For Musi, the App Store removal came as an existential threat, prompting a lawsuit after Musi's attempts to work out the dispute with Apple outside of court failed. The music-streaming app has alleged that the Apple ban did not come at YouTube's request but at the request of Apple's apparent music industry friends who allegedly asked Apple to find a way to get the app removed—prompting Apple to push YouTube to re-open a supposedly resolved complaint. In acourt filing, Apple claimed that this \"conspiracy theory,\" as well as other \"baseless\" claims, were \"false and misleading allegations\" warranting sanctions. \"Discovery thoroughly disproved Musi’s baseless conspiracy theory that Apple schemed to eliminate the Musi app from the App Store to benefit 'friends' in the music industry,\" Apple argued. But Musi fired back over the weekend,callingApple's motion for sanctions \"frivolous\" and demanding sanctions be ordered instead against Apple for allegedly abusing the sanctions rule as a \"tactic of intimidation and harassment.\" Musi noted that Apple's requested sanctions against Musi \"are not appropriate if there is even 'some credible evidence,'\" then included internal emails and references to testimony from Apple's own employees that seemingly met this low bar. Most likely, this part of the dispute will not be settled until July 30, when a hearing is scheduled on the motions for sanctions. Apple is seemingly hoping that the court will agree that Musi's complaint misrepresents the facts and is so misleading that the complaint must be struck entirely, perhaps cutting out the heart of Musi's argument. However, Musi pointed out that Apple previously sought sanctions and withdrew that fight, allegedly recognizing that its bid for sanctions was \"baseless.\" To convince the court that this second bid is \"equally frivolous,\" Musi shared receipts, attaching internal communications from Apple employees that Apple allegedly worked hard to keep out of the courtroom. Apple has maintained that Musi's allegations regarding a music industry conspiracy are baseless, repeatedly noting that Apple can remove any app for any reason. But Musi suggested the evidence shows that Apple needed a reason to ban Musi after music industry stakeholders allegedly requested the removal and \"cooked up\" a YouTube complaint to serve as the basis. Ars could not immediately reach Apple or Jennifer Golinveaux, Musi's lawyer, for comment on the sanctions battle. But in aseparate filing, Golinveaux noted that Apple sent \"thousands of pages of documents\" to Musi, but those did not include any documents from key Apple employees that later had to be compelled. It was those employees whose communications allegedly show the \"backchannel scheme\" that Apple is accused of taking part in. Perhaps most notably, among those court-ordered productions were emails involving Elizabeth Miles. An Apple senior legal director, Miles was \"significantly involved in Apple’s discussions, outside of Apple’s normal app dispute process, with both Sony Music\" and the National Music Publishers Association \"about the Musi app,\" Golinveaux said. Miles, TorrentFreak noted, received an email in April 2024 from a Sony Music Entertainment executive who was asking for Apple's help to \"identify a path forward\" and \"have the Musi app removed from the Apple app store.\" A month later, Miles scheduled a call with the Sony executive, and then four days later, another Apple lawyer requested a meeting to be set up, supposedly with YouTube, which happened within a week, Musi said evidence showed. Apple also tried to block depositions from \"two key Apple witnesses\" who could explain what happened next, Golinveaux said. Violet Evan-Karimian was Apple’s in-house counsel who was flagged \"as the employee responsible for the decision to remove the Musi app,\" Golinveaux said. And Arun Singh was Apple’s relationship manager with YouTube who was \"responsible for arranging\" a \"call between Apple and YouTube about the Musi app\" shortly after Miles' back-and-forth with music publishers. Singh testified that YouTube's liaison confirmed that YouTube was unaware of the supposedly open complaint against Musi. Apparently, YouTube never received any of Apple's emails warning that the 2023 complaint would be marked resolved if YouTube never responded. But while Musi argues that meant the complaint was closed at the time that Singh reached out, Apple claims that the complaint was never resolved, and YouTube was eager to pursue it once Apple reached out. While Musi claims that none of these particular details matter much, it also suggested that the idea that YouTube wouldn't get communications from the App Store seemed so far-fetched that the court should consider if such a scenario was even feasible. \"Apple’s claim that the reason YouTube did not respond is because it supposedly was not receiving Apple’s emails is neither here nor there,\" Musi argued. \"The assertion that YouTube was not receiving those emails is highly dubious.\" Musi has alleged that Apple knows that this was not a typical protocol for removing apps from the App Store but instead the result of music publishers pressuring Apple to get rid of an app they didn't like. Miles—who continued contacting music publishers who eventually sent a letter supporting the ban—admitted as much in an email to Sony, describing the removal as a \"complex process,\" while confirming the deed was done, Musi alleged. It's unclear which side the court will find more persuasive when it comes to ordering sanctions, but Apple is painting Musi as the shady one in the fight. Not only was the app the subject of several other complaints, Apple claimed, but also Musi once \"impersonated a representative\" from Universal Music Group \"to regain access to the App Store,\" Apple alleged. To Musi critics, TorrentFreak noted, Musi seems \"parasitic,\" basing its business on streaming music off YouTube without itself paying artists. For Musi fans wondering if the app will ever return to the App Store, the end to this court fight likely isn't coming any time soon. Should Apple lose its bid for sanctions and be forced to face Musi's most recently amended complaint, the jury trial won't start until January 2026. In the meantime,Musi's supportremains active on Reddit, doggedly trying to help users who suddenly lose access as the fight drags on.

    "title": "The problem with The Last of Us season 2 is that it’s too faithful an adaptation",
    "article_text": "A short second season ends with a literal bang and a figurative whimper. Season 2 of HBO'sThe Last of Uswrapped up on Sunday night, and Ars' Kyle Orland (who's played the games) and Andrew Cunningham (who hasn't)are back to talk about the finale like they've talked about every other episode this season. While these recaps don't delve into every single plot point of the episode, there are obviouslyheavy spoilerscontained within, so go watch the episode first if you want to go in fresh. Kyle: Coming back from last week's Joel flashback, it took me a second to remember what was actually going on in \"The Present\" ofThe Last of Usas we enter the season 2 finale. Ellie marvels at how easy it was to torture a hated enemy even though the result was just two words indicating Abby's supposed location: \"whale\" and \"wheel.\" I don't think Ellie's turn to \"the dark side\" is unearned, exactly. But I do think that this single-minded, revenge-obsessed version of Ellie is a lot less interesting than the character we grew to love in season 1. We went into this season in a sort of adolescent family drama, and we are leaving it in post-apocalypticBreaking Bad. Andrew: To compare it toBreaking Badimplies some kind of gradual, nuanced transformation has taken place, where my problem with the season so far has been mostly the opposite thing. Everyone's motivations here make sense and are consistent, to some extent, with who we know these characters to be. Ellie is rash and impulsive; Dina is lovestruck; Jesse is loyal and selfless. It's just that trading the first season's story (an unlikely pairing navigates the breadth of a post-apocalyptic America, driven by the promise of a cure) for the second season's story (Ellie's revenge fantasy) is a huge downgrade! And I say this as someone who has been slightly warmer on the season overall than you have. They killed the most interesting character and, with him, the story's most interesting dynamic. Whatever followed that was probably always going to be a letdown, and I'm sure you can attest to that as a game-player who has already experienced a version of all of this. Kyle: Yes, I soured on the second game for pretty much the same reasons. But I also feel the show has been more artlessly blunt with some of its character moments. Like the way Jesse finds out about Dina's pregnancy, and then similarly declares that he \"can't die\" because he's going to be a father. It felt like an AI trained on the TV Tropes website was writing some of these scenes... Andrew: Listen, normally I'm all for blaming AI, but to blame AI for this one is to imply that lowest-common-denominator TV storytelling hasn't existed for as long as the medium has. Everyone is just performing the most-predictable version of their respective character archetypes. It's an expensive show with a talented cast and an interesting riff on the zombie apocalypse idea, so at a baseline it remains watchable. But I suppose that's damning with faint praise. Kyle: Yeah I didn't mean a literal AI. I meant that as a sick burn on the human writers. Andrew: I am trying to think of things to say to stop this from just being a litany of complaints, but unfortunately complaints are a lot of what I've got about this episode. I liked the visuals of Ellie's nighttime sojourn to the abandoned Ferris wheel. I feel like there is a slightly more interesting TV show happening off to the side of this one, about the conflict between the militarized WLF types and the cultists. But as far as Ellie has been concerned so far, these factions mostly exist to chase the other faction off at the last minute, saving Ellie's bacon again. Kyle: And to set up contrived philosophical discussions. Like when Jesse makes the perfectly reasonable decision not to mount a doomed attempt to save a cultist when they're outnumbered by WLF members. Then, later, Ellie twists that into Jesse chickening out because the guy \"wasn't a member of your community.\" No... I'm pretty sure the 6-to-2 odds had at least as much to do with it. But Ellie needs to turn the conversation back to how Joel represents \"my community... beaten to death.\" It's not subtle... Andrew: Yeah I found that moment frustrating because Ellie is here in direct contravention of what her community decided! And itisher community, as a group of people who have looked out for her and provided for her for years, whether she wants to admit that or not. She only uses this idea of \"community\" with Joel selectively, as a cudgel, so she can do what she already wants to do. By letting her have the last word on it, the show tacitly endorses her read of the situation, and it's a variety of vigilante justice that TV audiences have been primed to sympathize with, but man it just falls flat for me. Kyle: I was also perplexed by Ellie's brief shipwreck storyline, which led to her being put in a noose by angry cultists. Then she gets saved just seconds from death by a deus ex machina problem in \"The Village\" that requires the cultists to immediately put her execution on hold and run away. And after all that she just... hops in a boat and goes off to the next completely unrelated bit of the story. I suppose they're probably setting things up to provide more context for that scene in the next season, but in the context of this episode as it stands it was just a baffling way to use up 10 minutes or so. Andrew: Yes I am assuming all the time spent setting up these cultists is going to pay off somehow, eventually, but it hasn't happened yet. The episode's other Big Emotional Moment comes when Ellie catches up with a couple of members of Abby's crew (I imagine a Hells Angels-style leather jacket, emblazoned with ABBY'S CREW on the back) and ends up killing them both, including a heavily pregnant woman whose dying breaths are spent trying to talk Ellie into cutting her baby out of her. There's some kind of lesson here, about the ultimate futility of revenge, about the sins of the parents, about what perpetuating the cycle of violence ultimately gets you. We'll see if Ellie ends up absorbing any of this in the end. In both her response to the underground torture scene and here, Ellie seems continually shocked that her quest for vengeance might involve any kind of collateral damage to anyone other than Abby. Kyle: Yes, this bit is culled from the game, but there she just discovers the unborn baby after both of Abby's companions are already dead. The whole \"cut my baby out of me before I die\" thing was seemingly crafted to make this just that much more emotionally scarring for Ellie. But as you said, she doesn't really get to spend any time absorbing any of that, because we're moving right on to the next plot point. I understand how and why we don't get to have 23 episode seasons of TV shows anymore, but it feels like some of the 17 side stories they introduce in this episode (and many more throughout this season) could have stood to have some more time to breathe. Andrew: I was astounded—astounded! That this was ourseason finale, because it feels like such a transitional piece-moving episode, and because we're onlyseven episodes in. I get that we are stretching one game into two seasons here, but the nine-episode first season was already short, and then this one's even shorter. Can we just agree to return to 13-episode seasons, please? Anyway, if your main complaint about the Seattle section of the show has been \"too much wheel spinning,\" this episode's big, dramatic cliffhanger is bad news for you. Every day Ellie has spent in Seattle has gotten some bigMajora's Mask-esque \"DAY ONE, DAY TWO, etc\" subtitle, and now we know why. The beginning of next season is going to show us the events of these three days—but from Abby's perspective! I guess I caused this by saying \"what if Abby were a more fully formed antagonist\" to my monkey's paw at the start of the season. But I can't say that this has me on the edge of my seat about season 3, this little slip of a teaser at the end of an episode that I didn't know was the season finale until after the fact. Kyle: Yes, this structure also apes the second game, which switches to Abby's backstory halfway through (though there's no \"season break\" in the middle there). The dramatic reveal of Abby's community being housed in a football stadium is one of the most memorable moments of the game and was a rare highlight of this episode, I felt. Before that, though, we get the inevitable and deadly confrontation between Ellie/Jesse/Tommy and Abby. After seeing it in the show, I had to go back and rewatch how it plays out in the game because something just felt off in the translation. Sure enough, the TV show production added Ellie screaming \"no no no\" andthe sound of a gunshotbefore that dramatic cut to black and transition to Abby's earlier POV. As usual, it feels like the show has a need to just crank up the drama at every turn in an effort to make sure people tune in next week (or next season). Andrew: Let's return to that divide between me as a show-watcher and you as a game-player as we wrap up. I find myself with more gripes than praise here at the end of the season. There are still a lot of things I like here—like I said, the fictional universe is compelling enough to keep it watchable, and for all my complaints about Ellie the character, Bella Ramsey as a performer is doing the best work they can with sort of underwhelming material (predictably, some corners of the Internet have decided to harangue Ramsey relentlessly, partly because they're a non-binary person who has decided to exist in public). But my impression is that my biggest problems with this season, from the killing of Joel to the single-minded vengeance arc, are all downstream of story decisions made years ago during the development ofThe Last of Us Part 2. Normally the complaint with an adaptation is that the show or film's creators are ruining the story somehow by being insufficiently faithful to the source material and losing something in the process. But it feels like the show's problems are mostly inherited from the game—in other words, that the show is beingtoofaithful to underwhelming source material. Is this a fair assessment, or am I missing something? Kyle: I'd say that the structural problems of the show are mostly derived from the game's decision to transition from \"buddy adventure\" to \"revenge saga\" as we've discussed ad nauseam. But a lot of the nitty-gritty problems of this season—stuff like pacing, flow, character development, etc.—actually come off a little worse because of decisions to add or change things for the show. After season 1, I was hopeful that some light-touch changes could help redeem a game that I did not enjoy much. Instead, I think they somehow made it worse. Andrew: Oops! Well, there’s always next season. Maybe all of our complaints will be substantively addressed and then some. The only thing we can say for sure is: We haven’t seen the last ofThe Last of Us. Kyle: In the end, the realLast of Uswas all the people we killed along the way. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "article_text": "Probe into lack of age verification targets Pornhub, Stripchat, XNXX, XVideos. European regulators have opened formal proceedings into Pornhub and three other adult platforms for suspected violations of the Digital Services Act (DSA), the European Commissionannouncedyesterday. Pornhub, Stripchat, XNXX, and XVideos are accused of failing to prevent minors from accessing adult content. \"The Commission preliminarily found that the platforms do not comply with putting in place appropriate and proportionate measures to ensure a high level of privacy, safety and security for minors, in particular with age verification tools to safeguard minors from adult content,\" the EC said. The regulatory body said preventing minors from accessing adult content with age verification tools is needed to prevent \"negative effects on the rights of the child\" and \"the mental and physical well-being of users.\" The EC's preliminary finding is based on risk assessment and audit reports sent by the companies and their replies to the EC's requests for information. \"Protecting young users online is one of the key enforcement priorities under the DSA,\" the EC said. \"Online platforms must ensure that the rights and best interests of children are central to the design and functioning of their services. If proven, failure to comply with these requirements would constitute infringements of the DSA.\" DSA violations can be punished with fines of up to 6 percent of total worldwide annual turnover. The opening of formal proceedings means the commission will investigate further and could \"take further enforcement steps, such as adopting interim measures and non-compliance decisions,\" the EC's announcement said. The commission said it could also \"accept commitments made by Pornhub, Stripchat, XNXX and XVideos to remedy the issues raised in the proceedings.\" In a statement provided to Ars, Pornhub owner Aylo said the company is \"aware of the European Commission's investigation\" and is \"fully committed to ensuring the safety of minors online. Our sites are fully RTA compliant as rated by the Association of Sites Advocating Child Protection (ASACP), and are strictly reserved for those of legal age only.\" The ASACP is a nonprofit that isfundedlargely by adult industry companies. It offers a Restricted To Adults (RTA)labelfor \"any website that wishes to clearly and effectively label itself as being inappropriate for viewing by minors.\" The label is supposed to make it easier for filtering software to block porn websites. In the US, numerous states passed laws requiring age verification on porn websites. Pornhub and other platforms responded to the state laws by blocking access to their sites in those states. Pornhub's websitesaysit blocks access in US states with age verification laws because any effective method of verifying users' ages \"requires them to submit some form of personally identifiable information ('PII), like a driver's license.\" This also \"creates a substantial risk for identity theft\" and \"opens the door for the risk of data breaches,\" Pornhub says. Pornhub has said it is willing to use a device-based system that would \"identify users at the source: by their device, or account on the device, and allow access to age-restricted materials and websites based on that identification.\" This kind of system would mean that users are only \"verified once, through their operating system, not on each age-restricted site,\" Pornhub says on its website. \"We will always comply with the law, but we hope that governments around the world will implement laws that protect the safety and security of users,\" Aylo said in its statement today. \"We believe that the real solution for protecting minors and adults alike is to verify users' ages at the point of access—the users' devices—and for websites to deny or permit access to age-restricted materials based on that verification.\" We contacted Stripchat, XNXX, and XVideos about the EU investigation and will update this article if we get any response. XNXX and XVideos have the same owner. European regulators are pushing for use of an age-verification app that they say will be available this summer. The EC said it \"is developing a white label age-verification app, intended to bridge the gap until theEU Digital Walletbecomes available by the end of 2026. The app, based on the same technology as the EU Digital Wallet, can be implemented by the Member States and then used by online service providers to verify if the user is over 18 without revealing further identity information, thus fully respecting their privacy. The app will be available by summer 2025.\" The four adult sites being investigated were previously designated by the EC as Very Large Online Platforms, meaning they had 45 million average monthly users in the EU. Stripchat has since fallen below that threshold. An assessment by the EC \"concluded that Stripchat's number of average monthly active recipients in the EU had been lower than the relevant threshold for an uninterrupted period of one year,\" the EC said. \"Stripchat's obligations as a Very Large Online Platform will cease to apply four months from its de-designation. General obligations, including the obligation to ensure a high level of protection of minors on its service, will continue to apply to Stripchat.\" Smaller adult sites are being eyed by regulators in individual European countries. The commission said that member states \"are taking a coordinated action against smaller pornographic platforms\" that \"fall under the supervision of the respective nationalDigital Services Coordinators (DSCs)of the Member State where they are established.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "RFK Jr. revokes COVID shot recommendations for kids, during pregnancy",
    "article_text": "Kennedy's move may make it harder for kids and pregnant people to get vaccinated. Anti-vaccine advocate and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has unilaterally revoked federal recommendations for healthy children and pregnant people to get COVID-19 booster shots. The abrupt change, announced on social media, could make it yet more difficult, if not impossible, for healthy children and pregnant people to have access to the seasonal vaccines, which have proven safe and effective at protecting both of those groups from severe illness. In a regulatory meeting last week, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention epidemiologist Ruth Link-Gelles presented 2023–2024data showing that COVID-19 boosters effectively protected childrenand teens from needing urgent or emergency care due to COVID-19 (slide 36). In children 9 months to 4 years old in that season, the boosters provided 52 percent added effectiveness over background immunity from past vaccination and illness. The boosters were 64 percent effective in kids ages 5 to 17. Likewise, theAdvisory Committee on Immunization Practices(ACIP) and health experts have firmly recommended COVID-19 vaccination for pregnant people. Even leaders of the Food and Drug Administration under Kennedy have identified pregnancy as a medical condition that increases the risk of severe COVID-19. Last week, FDA leaders announceda framework to restrict COVID-19 booster accessonly to people 65 and older and those with medical conditions that increase risks—the FDA's list of those medical conditions includes \"pregnancy and recent pregnancy.\" Vaccination during pregnancy also protects newborns. A2022 studypublished in the New England Journal of Medicine found that COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy \"reduced risk of hospitalization for COVID-19, including for critical illness, among infants younger than 6 months of age.\" Nevertheless, in the video posted on social media Tuesday, Kennedy announced that he \"couldn't be more pleased\" that \"as of today\" the COVID-19 vaccine has been removed from the CDC's recommended immunization schedule for healthy children and pregnant women. He falsely claimed that there was a \"lack of any clinical data\" to support the use of booster shots. In the video, Kennedy was flanked by Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health, and Marty Makary, the Food and Drug Administration commissioner. Makary, who listed pregnancy as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness just last week, said in the video that there's no evidence for use in healthy children. Bhattacharya chimed in to say Kennedy's announcement is \"common sense and it's good science.\" \"We're now one step closer to realizing President Trump's promise to make America healthy again,\" Kennedy concludes. Kennedy's move, like the FDA's last week, is unprecedented in bypassing the transparent, evidence-based process for setting vaccination recommendations. The CDC sets this guidance and relies on in-depth input from its advisory committee of independent vaccine experts, ACIP. ACIP meets periodically in all-day meetings to publicly review detailed data on vaccine safety and effectiveness, hear from various stakeholders—vaccine makers, clinicians, patients, scientists, and federal regulators—and discuss recommendations before holding votes on what they think the CDC should do. The CDC typically adopts ACIP's recommendations. ACIP has not recommended any such change. Its next meeting is scheduled for June 25–27, when it may discuss COVID-19 vaccines for this season. After Kennedy made the announcement, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) releaseda statementfrom President Steven Fleischman, saying that “ACOG is concerned about and extremely disappointed\" by the move. \"As ob-gyns who treat patients every day, we have seen firsthand how dangerous COVID-19 infection can be during pregnancy and for newborns who depend on maternal antibodies from the vaccine for protection, Fleischman said. \"[T]he science has not changed. It is very clear that COVID-19 infection during pregnancy can be catastrophic and lead to major disability, and it can cause devastating consequences for families. The COVID-19 vaccine is safe during pregnancy, and vaccination can protect our patients and their infants after birth.\" Fleischman ended by saying that ACOG is worried that fewer of their patients will get vaccinated and that those who want to get vaccinated will not have access or insurance coverage due to the announcement. \"And as ob-gyns, we are very concerned about the potential deterioration of vaccine confidence in the future,\" he concluded. This post has been updated to include the response from ACOG. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Falcon 9 sonic booms can feel more like seismic waves",
    "article_text": "Trajectories, wind shear, temperature gradients, topography, and weather can affect how a sonic boom spreads. TheVandenberg Space Force Basein Santa Barbara, California, serves military space launch missions as well as launches for NASA and commercial entities like SpaceX. But how do all those launches affect residents living along the Central Coast? People might marvel at the spectacular visual display, but as launch activity at the base has ramped up, so havethe noise complaints, particularly about the sonic booms produced by Falcon 9 launches, which can reach as far south as Ventura County. The booms rattle windows, frighten pets, and have raised concerns about threats to the structural integrity of private homes. There have been rockets launching from Vandenberg for decades, so why are the Falcon 9 launches of such concern? \"Because of the Starlink satellites, the orbital mechanics for where they're trying to place these in orbit is bringing [the trajectories] closer to the coast,\" said Brigham Young University'sKent Gee, who described his research into sonic boom effects on neighboring communities ina press briefingata meetingof the Acoustical Society of America in New Orleans. And the launches are occurring much more frequently, from two to three launches per year in the 1980s to between five and seven launches each month today. There were 46 Falcon 9 launches out of the Vandenberg base in 2024 alone, per Gee. Gee joined a project called ECOBOOM (Environmental and Community Observation of Sonic Booms) to study the factors that can impact just how jarring those sonic booms might be, conducted jointly by BYU and California State University, Bakersfield, with cooperation from the Space Force. \"Space Force is interested in this because they feel a sense of stewardship,\" said Gee. \"These rockets from SpaceX and other providers are launched from the base for a variety of missions and they want to understand the effects both on and off base, trying to understand how they can complete the mission while minimizing [negative] impacts.\" Gee and his cohorts monitored 132 separate sonic booms last summer, relying on data gathered via a network of 25 or so acoustic monitoring stations located along 500 square miles, including the beaches of Isla Vista and further inland to the hills of Ojai. \"The measurements were made in parks, people's backyards, parking lots, wastewater plants, and all sorts of different locations,\" said Gee. There has been a great deal of research on supersonic aircraft, but the sonic booms produced by rockets like the Falcon 9 are acoustically distinct, according to Gee. For instance, most sonic booms have two shock waves, but the Falcon 9 booster produces a boom with three shocks as it descends through the atmosphere after launch. Gee co-authoreda paperearlier this year analyzing the acoustic signatures of three Falcon 9 flyback sonic booms. While the first and third shocks were what one might typically expect, the second central shock \"is formed by a combination of the grid fins and the lower portions of the booster, including the folded landing legs,\" Gee and BYU colleague Mark C. Anderson wrote. \"These lower portions of the booster produce a rarefaction wave that tends to migrate toward the back of the shock system while the grid fins produce a shock wave that tends to migrate toward the front of the shock system.\" Those shock waves merge, and their relative strengths determine where this second shock appears in the full sonic boom acoustic signature. Sonic booms from rockets are also lower frequency, with peaks of less than 1 Hz—below the range of human hearing. The result is less of a \"boom\" and more of a \"bang,\" according to Gee, that can last a few seconds, compared to milliseconds for a typical acoustic wave. It's more akin to a seismic wave, particularly if one is indoors when it hits. \"Sometimes you get a very low amplitude rumble, but it comes on suddenly, and it's there for a few seconds and disappears,\" he said. It's also one reason why the sonic booms can travel so far afield of the Vandenberg base. Could the similarities confuse California residents who might mistake a sonic boom for an earthquake? Perhaps, at least until residents learn otherwise. \"Since we're often setting up in people's backyard, they text us the results of what they heard,\" said Gee. \"It's fantastic citizen science. They'll tell us the difference is that the walls shake but the floors don't. They're starting to be able to tell the difference between an earthquake or a sonic boom from a launch.\" A rocket's trajectory also plays an important role. \"Everyone sees the same thing, but what you hear depends on where you're at and the rocket's path or trajectory,\" said Gee, adding that even the same flight path can nonetheless produce markedly different noise levels. \"There's a focal region in Ventura, Oxnard, and Camarillo where the booms are more impactful,\" he said. \"Where that focus occurs changes from launch to launch, even for the same trajectory.\" That points to meteorology also being a factor: Certain times of year could potentially have more impact than others as weather conditions shift, with wind shears, temperature gradients, and topography, for instance, potentially affecting the propagation of sonic booms. In short, \"If you can change your trajectory even a little under the right meteorological conditions, you can have a big impact on the sonic booms in this region of the country,\" said Gee. And it's only the beginning of the project; the team is still gathering data. \"No two launches look the same right now,\" said Gee. \"It's like trying to catch lightning.\" As our understanding improves, he sees the conversation shifting to more subjective social questions, possibly leading to the development of science-based local regulations, such as noise ordinances, to address any negative launch impacts. The next step is to model sonic booms under different weather conditions, which will be challenging due to coastal California's microclimates. \"If you've ever driven along the California coast, the weather changes dramatically,\" said Gee. \"You go from complete fog at Vandenberg to complete sun in Ventura County just 60 miles from the base.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "OnePlus is the latest smartphone maker to go all-in with AI",
    "article_text": "OnePlus has been slower than most to implement mobile AI, but that's changing. OnePlus thrives on trends—if other smartphone makers are doing something, you can bet OnePlus is going to have a take. The company recently confirmed it's ditching the storied alert slider in favor of an Apple-like shortcut button called the Plus Key, and that's not the only trend it'll chase with its latest phones. OnePlus has also announced an expanded collection of AI features for translation, photography, screen capture, and more. OnePlus isn't breaking new ground here, but it is cherry-picking some of the more useful AI features we've seen on other phones. The OnePlus approach covers most of the established AI use cases. There will be AI VoiceScribe, a feature that records and summarizes calls in popular messaging and video chat apps. Similarly, AI Call Assistant will record and summarize phone calls, a bit likeGoogle's Pixel phones. However, these two features are India-only for now. Globally, OnePlus users will get AI Translation, which pulls together text, voice, camera, and screen translation into a single AI-powered app. AI Search, meanwhile, allows you to search for content on your phone and in OnePlus system apps in a \"conversational\" way. That suggests to us it's basically another chatbot on your phone, like Motorola's Ask and Search feature, which wedidn't love. OnePlus also promises some AI smarts in the camera. AI Reframe will analyze what's in your viewfinder and suggest different framing options. AI Best Face 2.0 (which will roll out later this summer) will analyze and correct things like closed eyes or \"suboptimal expressions.\" This sounds like a OnePlus version of Google's Best Take, but we're not complaining—that's a great feature. The OnePlus can work with group shots of up to 20 people, and you can even feed it photos taken on other phones to fix everyone's face. Core to OnePlus' approach is a feature called AI Plus Mind, which is integrated with the Plus Key. It allows you to capture content on your screen and save it to an AI-curated \"Mind Space.\" Again, OnePlus appears to be taking a page from Google's playbook with its own version of the Screenshots app. The OnePlus feature can allegedly extract useful information, like calendar appointments, so you don't have to add them to your agenda manually. A future update will also add automatic categorization of content in Mind Space. The company says it's using a hybrid approach to processing, which keeps sensitive data on your phone and only reaches out to the cloud when more power is needed. The specifics of the OnePlus system are still vague. Samsung includes a toggle to disable cloud processing, but Google just does what it thinks is right behind the scenes. We sure would like it if OnePlus borrowed from Samsung here. OnePlus is following Samsung's lead in at least one way. When Samsung launched theGalaxy S25 series, it included the first example of Gemini working across apps outside of Google's Pixel phones. Now, OnePlus will follow suit. As part of the OnePlus AI rollout, Gemini will gain the ability to interact with OnePlus apps like Notes and Clock. Many of these new OnePlus AI features will debut on the company's new OnePlus 13s, a variant of the China-only OnePlus 13T. However, the US and Europe are again being left out of the fun, with the 13s launching exclusively in India. Future OP devices will also be adopting the Plus Key, offering similar quick access to these AI features. Existing devices in the OnePlus 13 family will also get an update enabling most of these AI features. So even if you don't buy a new phone, you're getting more AI. Wipe that suboptimal expression off your face—don't you know it's the AI era now? Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "After Mr. Deepfakes shut down forever, one creator could face a $450K fine",
    "article_text": "Australia's online safety regulator asks for severe fine to combat flood of AI porn. A man who made global headlines after he continued sharing deepfake porn in defiance of an Australian court order is now facing one of the biggest fines ever threatened over the artificial intelligence-fueled abuse. Australia's eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, has recommended a fine between $400,000 and $450,000, The Guardianreported, suggesting that it's warranted to deter other repeat offenders. Fifty-three-year-old Anthony Rotondo, who divides his time between the Philippines and Australia, was ordered to take down AI-generated sexualized images of high-profile Australian women that Rotondo posted on the now-defunct Mr. Deepfakes site. Earlier this month, thatcontroversial site shut down foreverafter \"a critical service provider\" terminated the service \"permanently,\" but there hasn't been much news of what happened to the creators who uploaded tens of thousands of videos, attracting more than 1.5 billion views. However, in a sign that more consequences may be coming, just this weekend, Denmarksought to extradite a Canadian pharmacist, David Do, who is suspected of playing a key role in operating Mr. Deepfakes. If convicted, Do could face up to six months in prison under Danish defamation laws and potentially additional charges elsewhere. Rotondo is one of the first known Mr. Deepfakes creators, as verified by police. Instead of promptly removing the images, Rotondo was sanctioned $25,000 in December 2023 for defying that court order while continuing to target more victims in the days after he received it—allegedly including minors attending an Australian private school. While the names of his victims are supposed to be kept confidential, he also forwarded the court order to 49 email addresses, including to media outlets, which identified some of the victims. That email had another deepfake attached, The Guardian noted. Australia reformed its lawsto criminalize such deepfakes after Rotondo's arrest, which followed an Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) investigation into \"an anonymous online creator\" targeting seven Australian public figures online. He may avoid the maximum six-year prison sentence under those reforms but has since been charged with five counts of obscene publications and exhibitions, as well as one count of obscene publication and exhibition of a child under 16 years, ABC reported. In court, Rotondo \"did not show any remorse or contrition for his conduct,\" Justice Roger Derrington said at the sanctions hearing, ABCreported. He apparently thought that the Australian order could not be enforced because he was a resident of the Philippines. \"Get an arrest warrant if you think you are right,\" Rotondo reportedly told officials prior to the sanctions hearing, the Brisbane Timesreported. Later, in front of the judge, he unsuccessfully argued that he didn't intend to out his victims by email. He claimed he didn't know the court order was attached to the email or that it contained his victims' names, The Guardian reported. \"The email I received had more than 80 pages of writing,\" Rotondo said. \"I didn't read all the pages. I just forwarded the email.\" Eventually, Rotondo gave police his passwords to delete the images posted on Mr. Deepfakes. But the judge noted that Rotondo appeared resistant to removing deepfakes and continued creating an unknown number of deepfakes—which may include further charges from Queensland police that he possibly targeted \"a number\" of facilities and businesses on the day he allegedly hit the high school. He perhaps was motivated to leave the images online, as toxic Mr. Deepfakes uploaders could earn as much as $1,500 for convincing non-consensual deepfakes of public figures. \"The history of the matter suggests that, were he still at liberty and perhaps in another country, he would not have been so accommodating,\" Derrington said. Governments globally are grappling with a stark rise in non-consensual deepfake porn, with an ever-widening lens that targets not just the people who create and share images or the sites that host and sell them, but also the social media platforms that don't catch and delete the harmful content. Earlier this month, theUS passed a lawthreatening heavy fines and prison time for platforms that fail to remove the images when they're reported. Under that law, theTake It Down Act, Wiredreportedthat platforms risk roughly $50,000 in penalties per violation if deepfakes aren't removed within 48 hours of receiving a report. In Australia, Inman Grant wants to find a way to end the \"lingering and incalculable devastation\" that she said predominantly female victims must endure because it's \"shockingly\" free and easy to use \"thousands of open-source AI apps\" to make deepfake porn. Because Rotondo seems to represent the kind of unapologetic repeat deepfaker who digs his heels in to defend his AI-generated fake sex images, Inman Grant asked for the maximum penalties on Monday. The eSafety commission's spokesperson told The Guardian that the request \"reflected the seriousness of the breaches\" and \"the significant impacts on the women targeted.\" \"The penalty will deter others from engaging in such harmful conduct,\" the spokesperson said.

    "title": "F1 in Monaco: No one has ever gone faster than that",
    "article_text": "The least-sensible F1 race of the year is also the most glamorous. The principality of Monaco is perhaps the least suitable place on the Formula 1 calendar to hold a Grand Prix. A pirate cove turned tax haven nestled between France and Italy at the foot of the Alps-Maritimes, it has also been home to Grand Prix racing since 1929, predating the actual Formula 1 world championship by two decades. The track is short, tight, and perhaps best described as riding a bicycle around your living room. It doesn’t even race well, for the barrier-lined streets are too narrow for the too-big, too-heavy cars of the 21st century. And yet, it’s F1’s crown jewel. Despite the location's many drawbacks, there’s something magical about racing in Monaco that almost defies explanation. The real magic happens on Saturday, when the drivers compete against each other to set the fastest lap. With overtaking as difficult as it is here, qualifying is everything, determining the order everyone lines up in, and more than likely, finishes. Coverage of the Monaco Grand Prix is now filmed in vivid 4K, and it has never looked better. I’m a big fan of the static top-down camera that’s like a real-time Apple TV screensaver. Although native-Monegasque Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc tried to temper expectations for the weekend, the Ferraris were in a good place in Monaco. With no fast corners, the team could run the car low to the ground without risking a penalty, and this year's car excels at low-speed corners, of which Monaco has plenty. A 10th of a second separated comfortably being in Q2 from being relegated to the last couple of rows in the grid, and a very long Sunday. Mercedes' new teenage protegé, Kimi Antonelli, failed to progress from Q1, spinning in the swimming pool chicane. Unlike Michael Schumacher in 2006, Antonelli didn't do it on purpose, but he did bring out a red flag. His teammate George Russell similarly brought a halt to Q2 when he coasted a third of the way around the circuit before coming to a stop in the middle of the tunnel, requiring marshals to push him all the way down to turn 10. The gaps at the front were much bigger for Q3, and the lap times much quicker. Three drivers broke the existing track record set by Lewis Hamilton during qualifying in 2021, with McLaren's Lando Norris the fastest at 1:09.954—the fastest time ever for this configuration of the circuit. In order to try to spice up the race this year, the sport's organizers mandated that every driver perform two tire-changing pit stops during the race. This opened up a lot of potential strategies, but in the end, no one went for the “stop twice early in quick succession” that was so talked about by the pundits in the lead-up to the race. On lap 2, a virtual safety car opened up early stops for people at the back half of the grid, but with the current supersized cars, there was very little interesting action during the race. Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso was set to score his best result of the year with a sixth place, but his engine blew on lap 39. Teams that had both cars running together on track could use the second car to hold up everyone behind and give their teammate a hassle-free pit stop, but none of the teams able to employ this strategy were set to score points. Lewis Hamilton managed to make up a couple of places, but most everyone finished where they started. The race was dominated by pole-sitter Norris, although Verstappen took the lead for much of the last third of the race, and only by dint of not having made his second pit stop. Hoping for a red flag or safety car that would give him that stop for free, Verstappen was left unsatisfied and had to come in under green flag conditions for a tire change just before the end, leaving him in fourth place. McLaren's Oscar Piastri took third, looking a little behind Norris all weekend. Leclerc took second, with Norris the victor. Next week, Barcelona!

    "article_text": "Walt Disney Pictures‘ live-actionLilo & StitchÂopened over Memorial Day weekend. While it’s making massive numbers for the studio, fans of the original film are shocked by the enormous changes to the animated film in itsadaptation. There’s minor stuff likePleakley’s distance from drag, but the film’s human version of the character still very much fancies femme wear anyways. There’s also anger at the omission of Gantu, the Galactic Federation’s strongman, who you could argue felt like a random third act villain in the overstuffed animated feature’s ending (famously, the 2002 movie underwent major changes mid-production, since itsoriginal ending took place on a hijacked plane). What’s more, the culture has shifted a lot in the past few decades. So it makes sense that the new movie makes some alterations, including offering a more grounded take on the story. In particular, the ending is stirring up heated discourse on the internet regarding Nani’s (Sydney Agudong) custody of her little sister Lilo (Maia Kealoha). In the 2002 film, Nani overcomes her social worker, former CIA agent Cobra Bubbles (Ving Rhames in the original, Courtney B. Vance in the live action film), in his attempts to get Lilo taken away from her; he ultimately relents after family is placed under the protection of the interstellar Galactic Federation. That’s not at all what happens in the remake. Here, Nani hands over guardianship to their grandmotherly neighbor Tutu (Amy Hill), who throughout the film watches over the sisters as they try to have a parent and child dynamic, so Nani can leave home and attend college. Nani, who is implied to be just out of high school, really struggles to keep her little family afloat in the new film, especially after Stitch crash-lands into their lives.Tutu, with the help of their case worker Mrs. Kekoa (Tia Carrere, who voiced Nani in the animated film, playing a new character separated entirely from Vance’s version of Bubbles, who remains a CIA agent), facilitates a way for the girls to stay sisters and yet both still have a childhood. And in Nani’s case, that means the opportunity to leave her sister in safe hands while she follows her own goals, and presumably better provide for Lilo and Stitch in the future.Â This recontextualization of the story’s themes drive this change, and not everyone is happy about it. The significant thread that ties everything together in both films is the exploration of “Ohana,” the Hawaiian word for “family,” and emphasizes that “no one gets left behind or forgotten.” The originalÂLilo & Stitch, placed in a broader context of Hawaii’s cultural relationship with the United States and colonial underpinnings between the two nations (touched on in both the original and the remake when Nani sings “Aloha Oe” to her sister, a traditional song often interpreted as lamentation of the loss of Hawaii’s sovereignty under American annexation), has often been considered as critiquing U.S. interests in Hawaii andÂ  the historical legacy of colonialism’s separation of families. And so, a lot of the criticism of the new ending argues that Nani has seemingly giving up her sister to the system, in order to follow her own desires to go to college, betrays the idea of Ohana that’s is championed by the original film. Instead, the live action film comes at this struggle by centering Nani being forced to grow up beyond her years in order to look after Lilo. In the original film, Nani is presented as older than she is in the live-action film (the fact that she is Lilo’s guardian suggests that she’s at least 18, although it’s never explicitly stated), something that always struck me as a commentary on girls having to be treated as more traditionally motherly upon reaching a certain age, pushed into preconceived expectations and roles even in their youths. While Nani’s story is more explicitly about her struggle to balance caring for Lilo with the mania compounded by Stitch’s arrival, the story of young women, especially women of color, being forced by circumstance to grow up too quickly no doubt resonates with the broad audience a film likeLilo & Stitchhas. As a mother now, I can look back at the 2002 film and see that Nani was still a kid herself, and prioritizesher sister over her own potential dreams and aspirations. She leaves herself behind to be her little sister’s guardian after they lost their parents, especially because that version of Nani and Lilo didn’t have a village to look out for them. Speaking toCinemaBlend, producer Jonathan Eirich shared that Chris Kekaniokalani Bright, who co-scripted the 2025 film, had some insight into how the animated version’s lack of a community around Nani and Lilo didn’t sit right. “Something [Chris] said early on, he was like, âI don’t think in Hawaiâi, if these two sisters had just lost their parents, I don’t think they would be as isolated.â [Knowing] the community of Hawaii there would be support for them.â So, we sort of had this notion of this neighbor character, Tutu, that is actually there for them earlier in the story.” Community functioning as an extension of family becomes a new reinterpretation of Ohana in the live-action film. Instead of the case worker being Bubbles, trying to foil Nani’s attempts at keeping Lilo (and his ex-CIA background once more explicitly tying him into the U.S.-Hawaii relationship as cultural context) in the animated feature, in the new film the case worker is now a fellow native Hawaiian character who encourages Nani to see if she can make the transition work. It really approaches this idea in a broader sense of Hawaiian culture, where we’re repeatedly reminded that Nani’s âkuleana,â or responsibility, is to give Lilo the best possible future. In that context, you really feel for Nani as a girl struggling to keep her family afloat while grieving her parents. And this is before Stitch arrives in the picture, which really steers the focus to the sisters needing their childhood reclaimed as they have adventures with their new “dog.” But no matter how the changes to the original were going to be handled, a backlash toLilo & Stitchwould’ve been inevitable regardless, given the broad cynicism towards Disney’s live-action remakes in recent years regardless of their box office successes. Nani doesn’t give up her sister to strangers in a foster system, as many who might not have seen the movie claim. Tutu and Mrs. Kekoa help them navigate toward a solution where they’re still together and with their found family. She sees that she can lean on her extended family that’s always been there, while also getting a chance to experience early adulthood without sacrificing herself or her sister. Hill herself recently expounded on that idea of found family within the concept of Ohana, prior to the blowback. “It’s not just the family, it’s now the extended family. And I’m part of that extended family. I’m not blood related to them. I live next door. I knew the parents. I knew the kids since they were little. And I just feel so close to them. And it just is, of course, a natural progression to feel like I want to take care of them and also be a little nosy about things. Cause isn’t that what family is?” she said in an interview posted onStage. It makes sense for Tutu to play the role of guardian to not just Lilo, but Nani too, in supporting her pursuit of higher education and rediscovering her love of surfing. The movie even provides a more fantastical solution to the issue of Nani leaving her sister and Hawaii behind, which is set up earlier in the film. Remember that portal gun Jumba uses to get to various spots where Stitch was sighted? In the end, it’s revealed that Nani now has it, which means she can come home home after school and still be very much present in Lilo’s life. It sure beats sleeping in a dorm room when you can easily transport to your room at home, and it still keeps the sisters togetherâa best of both worlds that allows the remake to have its own take on similar themes to the animated original.

    "title": "Your Phone’s Next Big Innovation Is… a Dedicated AI Button?",
    "article_text": "I love buttons.I like them in cars(sorry, touchscreens), I like them in my games (not sorry, iPad touchscreen controls), andIloveÂthem on my phones. I’m apparently not alone in that love for phone buttons, and more and more phone makers are taking note. Even Apple, for all of its contributions to the world of touchscreens, is hopping on that tangible train, adopting the Action Button, its programmable key for launching basically anything you want, and theCamera Control, which controls your camera (duh), including shutter, launching the camera app, etc. But as much as I love buttons on my phone, there is one button I’ve yet to fully come around to, and it’s seemingly slated to be the next big pushable thing on your phoneâI’m talking about the trendy new “AI button.” AI buttons are real, physical, tactile keys that do exactly what they sound likeâthey trigger AI features. More and more phones in recent months have been adopting them, too. There’s Nothing’s “Essential Key,” which is a button on the side of the company’s phones (Nothinganditscheaper CMF phones like the Phone 2 Pro) that can look at what you’re doing on your device and take certain actions. For example, if you’re looking at tickets for a show, you could smash the Essential Key and then tell your phone to remind you to buy tickets at a later date/time. Similarly, Motorola and itshigh-end Razr Ultra flip-style foldableincludes an “AI Key” that triggers a host of AI features like “next move,” which can automatically open apps or provide suggestions based on what you’re doing on your phone at the time. It can also activate AI features like “look and talk,” which combines Moto AI with a voice assistant to help you use your phone hands-free when you’re in “tent mode.” And the dedicated button party doesn’t stop there. Just this week, OnePlus announced its 13S phone, which does away with the company’s signature Alert Slider switch in favor of the Plus Key button. In OnePlus’s defense, the Plus Key is similarly all-purpose and programmable like Apple’s Action Button but seems to also be geared heavily towards activating AI Plus Mind, a feature that’s very similar to Nothing’s Essential Space. Smarter than ever. The all-new OnePlus AI- intelligently yours, coming to the#OnePlus13s June 5th, 12 noon.

AI is the Next Big Thing, according to *checks notes* everyone who makes gadgets right now, so of course that ethos is going to inform hardware as well as software. On the other hand, there’s kind of a big problem with the whole AI button craze, and that’s that a lot of people just aren’t really using AI enough to justify a whole-ass button yet. Recentpolling from CNETsuggests that the overwhelming number of people (73% of iPhone users and 87% of Samsung users, to be exact) whocanÂuse AI on their devices say that they think the features add little to no value to their general phone experience. Contrast that sentiment with the fact that phone makers think AI features are important enough to stand among the ranks of (and this is the truth) the power/lock button. And that’s not the only downside to the AI button. There’s also the fact that this new crop of buttons may actually be an insidious billboard for both AI and AI subscriptions.According to Android Authority,which did a teardown of the Essential Space app in March, plans for monetization may be on the horizon for Nothing. While the company has given no official indication that it intends to turn Essential Space into a money-making machine, according to the teardown, the company’s AI app may not come cheap if and when that moment arrives. The teardown suggests that Nothing could charge as much as $120 to use Essential Space, though it’s unclear if that’s an annual subscription or a one-time fee. I love physical buttons as much as the next nerd, but when you’re dealing with the limitations of the physical world and the need for practicality that goes along with it, I’m not sure that AI quite rises to the occasion yet. Maybe that will change, and Apple Intelligence will soon warrant its coveted spot next to the Camera Control, but for now, I’m guessing most of your AI button presses might be the result of an accident while trying to do something truly useful, like locking your phone.

    "title": "Trump’s EPA Plans to Ditch Emission Limits on Power Plants",
    "article_text": "The United States was making solid progress on decarbonizing its energy sector. Time to hit rewind on that. According to areport from the New York Times, the Environmental Protection Agency under the Trump administration has drafted a plan that would eliminate all caps on greenhouse gas emissions from coal and gas-fired power plants. The proposal, which comes under the leadership of new EPA chief, andlongtime climate change skeptic, Lee Zeldin suggests that the emissions generated by power plants from burning fossil fuels âdo not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution”âa statement that seems to imply the existence of good pollution, but that’s a whole other thing. Per the Times, the agency’s repeal would apply to all greenhouse gas emissions standards that are currently applied to fossil fuel-fired power plants. That would effectively undo much of the work of the Biden administration to clean up the energy sector, including rolling back requirements for coal plants to capture carbon pollution before it leaves its smokestacks and store it, and rules that require gas plants to use newer technologies that produce fewer emissions. âWe are seeking to ensure that the agency follows the rule of law while providing all Americans with access to reliable and affordable energy,â Zeldin said in a statement to the Times. The US power sector continues to be one of the country’s largest sources of greenhouse gasâsecond overall, just behind the transportation industryâand is responsible for one-quarter of all carbon emissions. Under the Biden administration’s standards, new power plants were significantly cleaner than the existing infrastructure. According to a report fromCleanview, 96% of new power plants built in 2024 were carbon-free.Per the EPAduring the Biden era, its standards required existing coal-fired and new natural gas-fired power plants to control 90% of their carbon pollution, finding ways to capture or offset the emissions. Those requirements could go away entirely under Trump, opening up the possibility of more dirty-burning power plants getting built without any efforts to mitigate the potential harm. Even if the objection of Trump’s EPA is that it doesn’t believe fossil fuel emissions contribute to climate change, there are still plenty of adverse effects of dirty-burning fuels that are real and tangible. Astudy published in 2023found that the pollution produced by coal-fired power plants likely resulted in as many as 460,000 excess deaths, the result largely of air-based pollution that is generated by burning coal. So forget the long-term destruction that will result from the planet getting hotterâpeople are dying because of these plants right now. coalelectricityEnvironmental RegulationsEPAnatural gaspower plantsTrump administration Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "The History of Omega, the Beginning and the End of the Time Lords",
    "article_text": "If we thought allÂDoctor Whowas going to build its upcoming finale around was the return of one classic villain from its historyin the Rani, “Wish World” told usto think againin its final moments, as it invoked the name of an all-time terror in the history of the Time Lords: the dread Omega, not seen in the show properly in over 40 years. But Omega’s history is, fitting for a key player in the origins of the Time Lords themselves, paradoxically much old and yet also much more recent than that. A solar engineer and a prominent figure in early Gallifreyan societyâand, as later audio stories would reveal, a close confidant and schoolfriend of Rassilon, another key player in the foundation of the Time LordsâOmega first appeared inDoctor Who‘sfirst anniversary special, “The Three Doctors,” in late 1972. There it was revealed that it was Omega’s research that unlocked the key to time travel that would radically overhaul Gallifreyan society and create the Time Lords as we’d come to know them. Deploying a powerful relic known as the Hand of Omega, Omega made a star go supernova before harnessing its energies to fuel the first acts of controlled temporal manipulation. But while the Hand of Omega, and the research it bore, would be recovered by Gallifrey, Omega himself was seemingly lost in the destruction. Revered as a hero and made legend by his people as they used the Hand to become lords of Time, Omega had actually survived his experiment, flung into a black hole and deposited into a universe of pure antimatter. Not knowing that his people thought he was dead, Omega grew bitter as his acceptance at not being rescued turned to fury that he had been abandoned in his moment of triumph by the Gallifreyans. In time, Omega sought his own way out of the antimatter universe, experimenting on his power to manipulate it and even create his own lifeâat a cost that he failed to realize, as his own physical body broke down into nothingness. By the time the Time Lords tasked the First, Second, and Third Doctors with attempting to stop Omega from destroying the universe in his attempts to acquire more energy to fuel his escape, all that sustained Omega’s form was the original suit that he wore during his experiments with the Hand. After battling with the Third Doctor in an attempt to trade places in exile with him, Omega was left in the antimatter universe as it was seemingly destroyed. But his “death” had not stopped diehard followers of his own arising on Gallifrey, creating a legion of cultists that swore to bring one of Time Lord society’s foundational forces back to reality. In the 1983 serial “Arc of Infinity,” a member of Gallifrey’s High Council, Hedin, secretly plotted to steal the Doctor’s biological data to create a new physical form for Omega’s will to inhabit. Although the plan was foiled, Omega managed to briefly escape his antimatter universe and emerge on Earth, only to find his form destabilizing until he was imprisoned in the antimatter universe for good… again. It would take Omega almost 40 years to return toÂDoctor Whoon-screen… technically speaking. Because while Omega’s history as the creator of Gallifreyan time travel hasn’t changed, his broader part in the creation of Time Lord society on aÂbiologicallevel did in Chris Chibnall’s re-working of the Doctor’s origins in the2020 episode “The Timeless Child”, in which Omega makes a brief, uncredited appearance in flashbacks alongside Rassilon and Tecteun. Although the character is never explicitly named onscreen, theofficially released production scriptfor the episode names two Time Lord figures seen alongside Tecteun as to be assumed as Omega and Rassilon, making them aware of the true origins of Time Lord society as we come to know it in that story. As established in “The Timeless Child”, Tecteun was the scientist who found, and then successfully exploited, the genetic material of the titular childâthe mysterious being who would eventually become the Doctorâto give themselves the ability to regenerate their physical form upon mortal injury. In “The Timeless Child”‘s brief explanation of Gallifrey’s history, Omega’s discovery of time travel occurs during a golden age of advancement for the Shobogans, the native peoples of Gallifrey, during the construction of the Citadel and even before Tecteun decides to offer up the genetic inheritance of regeneration to the Citadel’s denizens, formally renaming their society as that of the Time Lords. But Omega is still considered a foundational member of this triumvirate that makes the Time Lords, even if, presumably, his loss in experimenting with the Hand of Omega now comes at a point separated from his discovery of time travel. Interestingly, what little we got to seeâor rather hear about, Omega is namechecked but left pointedly offscreenâof Omega in “Wish World” keeps vague about where exactly he has been kept since we last saw him. The Rani describes Omega has having been kept in an “underverse,” access to which required a fracture in reality itself, rather than the black holes and matter/antimatter that were previously established in Omega’s prior appearances. Whether or not the underverse is intended to be the same reality that Omega was trapped in in those original stories, or somewhere else he was potentially sent to after those events, remains to be seen. But that detail aside, Omega’s potential return to reality is largely irrelevant next to what the Rani intends to use him for: the resurrection of the Time Lords from their latest extinction. Again, just how remains to be seen, but ifÂDoctor Whodoes once again bring the Time Lords back for a third timeâafter their apparent destruction during theLast Great Time War, undone during the events of “The Day of the Doctor,” and then the Master’s eradication of his own people a few years later. As far asweknow, while Gallifrey the planet still exists in some form, unlike its prior fate in the Time War, the Time Lords themselves, save for the Rani, the Doctor, and the Master were seemingly all exterminated. Just how Omega’s power could restore the Time Lords,Âagain, remains to be seen. But with the revelation of the Timeless Child, and the Doctor’s understanding of their connection to Gallifrey, Omega is now even more important to the foundations of the Time Lords than he already was with the invention of time travelâ”Wish World” even describes him asthefirst Time Lord, and creator of their society. If he really is the key to their returnâor a continuation of their absence fromDoctor Who‘s current mythologyâwe’ll find out once and for all as the current season ofWhocomes to its end in “The Reality War” this weekend, on May 31.

    "title": "Roborock Saros Z70 Review: This Robovac’s Robotic Arm Is a Swing and a Miss",
    "article_text": "Coming out ofCES 2025, there wasnât a single product that generated more buzz thanRoborockâs Saros Z70 robot vacuum and mop, aka the one with the robotic arm. Anybody whoâs used a modern robovac knows you need to tidy up before the robot can go in and take care of the little bits. The Saros Z70 promised to change that. With a robotic arm that emerges from the top of the vacuum, itâs supposed to move pieces of garbage into a box and sort your loose slippers over into a dedicated zone. Unfortunately, not only does it fail to do that nearly every time, but it takes a step backward in its cleaning abilities, too. Not great, especially when weâre talking about the most expensive robovac on the market ($2,600), by a lot. At its core, the Saros Z70 is very similar to theSaros 10andSaros 10R, the latter of which is currently our highest-rated robot vacuum. It boasts a whopping 22,000 Pa of suction power, which puts it at the top of robovacs. It has dual spinning mop pads (one of which can extend away from its body to get right up against walls), which can automatically detach and reattach in the base, depending on whether theyâre needed. Thereâs a sweeper arm that extends off the side of it to get into corners. The Saros Z70 can vault itself over thresholds up to 4 centimeters (1.58 inches) tall. The base has two large water tanks, a small tank for floor cleaning liquid, and a disposable bag where all the dust and debris get collected. The mop pads are washed with 80-degree Celsius water (176 degrees Fahrenheit) and dried with hot air. Like the 10R, the Z70 doesnât have a 360-degree LIDAR turret on top, but it does have LIDAR beaming out from the front, in addition to cameras and other sensors. Roborock Saros Z70 Putting a robotic arm inside a robovac is great idea, but the Roborock Saros Z70 comes up short in execution. Maybe version 2.0 will work properly. Pros Cons But of course, the main point of differentiation between the Z70 and any other robovac weâve seen is the arm, which Roborock calls the OmniGrip. When the robot encounters an object that it recognizes as something it can clear, it announces, âSorting item,â and then a plastic panel on top opens up, and an articulating arm with a pincer pops out. The arm is then supposed to grab the object and sort it. The Saros Z70 comes with a small cardboard box with QR codes printed on all sides of it. You set the location of that box inside of a companion app, and the robovac is supposed to carry small items (like balls of paper or socks) over to the box and drop them in. If the Saros Z70 detects a slipper, itâs supposed to pick it up and bring it to a footwear zone that you designated in the app. Currently, itâs limited to recognizing slippers, socks, and balls of paper, but Roborock says it will be adding to those capabilities in future updates. Youâll notice I said âsupposed toâ a couple of times. Thatâs intentional. Unfortunately, the Saros Z70âs performance was absolutely abysmal when it came to doing its special tricks. It actually did a fairly good job recognizing and picking up balls of paper (though it often failed to see them on my patterned rug), and in the odd cases that it missed, it would make a second attempt and grab it. The problem is in the sorting. I ran more than 40 tests with paper balls and the occasional sock, and it only managed to put a ball of paper into the sorting box once. Once! I worked with Roborock on this, experimented with different box placements, placed the zone in the app differently, and remapped my entire apartment. It was going so badly that Roborock sent me a replacement unit just to make sure that there was nothing wrong with mine. Nope. Each time, the robot would pick up a ball of paper, take it somewhere near the box, and drop it on the floor, usually within 18 inches of the box. It would look right at the box, then turn at the last minute and drop it on the floor. It was maddening. Performance with slippers was even worse. In most of my tests, even though I could see in the app that the Z70 correctly identified them as slippers/footwear, the robovac would just bump into them and nudge them around. A few times, the arm would emerge and it would pick up the slipper, but then it would look around for a second and put the slipper right back down where it was. I tried it with three types of slippers and a shoe on both hardwood floors and carpet, and it had a zero-percent success rate. This is tremendously disappointing. It seems that Roborock is aware of these issues and has already issued a statement about fixes planned for June and July firmware updates, but I can only review this product as Iâm testing it, and unfortunately, my reservations about the Z70 extend beyond the arm (no pun intended). One of the key differences between the Z70 and previous Roborocks that we have loved is a new vacuum brush design. Units like the Saros 10R, Saros 10, and Qrevo Curv all feature a roller brush thatâs split in two in the middle, and the system did exceptionally well at picking up debris large and small, as well as remaining tangle-free even when dealing with long hair. The Saros Z70 has a brush that is just one single roller with a smaller diameter, Iâm guessing to make more room for the arm that lives in the robotâs body. Unfortunately, the new brush simply doesnât work as well. In my Snack Gauntlet Test (patent pending!), it was more prone to crushing Goldfish Crackers and Cheerios and leaving crumbs behind, whereas the previous units slurped them up with little difficulty. It did even worse with pistachio shells. While thatâs a tougher challenge, the units with the split brush design still managed to choke them down. With the Z70, they just got pinned between the brush and the floor, preventing the roller from spinning at all. It just dragged them around and made a horrible sound until I came and rescued it. I also found that the Z70âs mops were more prone to dripping and streaking than previous Roborocks I tested. The Saros Z70 also appears to have more difficulty with navigation than previous Roborocks weâve tested. It often takes slow, inexplicable routes. One time, I used the voice command (which works with Google Home, Alexa, and Apple Home, but also has its own mic and works independently), âHello Rocky, clean the kitchen,â and it only cleaned the front two-thirds of my kitchen. When I used the app to have it try again, it also only cleaned the front part. This is after it had no issue cleaning my kitchen more than a dozen times over the last two weeks. I had to command it to clean a special zone at the back, and even then, it didnât get nearly as close to the corner or the edges of the wall as itâs supposed to. The Z70 was also pretty hit and miss when it came to avoiding power cords. This is personal preference, but I think the dock is a bit more of an eyesore than it was on the Qrevo Curv or Saros 10 (though itâs effectively the same as the 10R). The water tanks at the top arenât covered, and itâs just a bit more visually obtrusive. Iâve also noticed that the Z70 tends to bump into and grind along walls a bit more, which has created some white marks on its front bumpers where paint has rubbed off onto itâI donât love that. The Z70 is supposed to have âIntelligent Dirt Detection,â which will cause it to go back and re-clean an area that it senses as particularly dirty, but I never saw this happen, and it often left messes in its wake, then returned to the base declaring itself finished. There is a first-person view remote control mode, which you can use to manually pick items up and move them around, which is fun, but ultimately it feels like a novelty. Itâs so slow that itâs not something youâd ever really use when youâre home. The real nail in the coffin here is the price. The Z70 was set to debut at $2,000 dollars, which would already make it the most expensive robovac on the planet. But between the initial announcement and the actual availability,Trumpâs tariffs hit, and boy did they hit hard. As a response, Roborock raised the price of the Saros Z70 to a staggering $2,600. That is a full thousand dollars more expensive than the Saros 10R, and it doesnât do basic cleaning as thoroughly based on my tests. I have a hunch that the engineering team spent so much time trying to get the OmniGrip working that it didnât have the resources dedicated to make sure it got the fundamentals right. If it sounds like Iâm disappointed, itâs only because Iâm really, really disappointed. Robovacs are suffering from sameness. Theyâre all practically clones of each other these days, so I was excited to see something so different finally come through. The Saros Z70 was a huge swing, and I love it when companies do that, especially when it could represent a lot of added convenience for the consumer. Unfortunately, Roborockâs first attempt is a swing and a miss. Thereâs potential there if the bot really can improve via software updates, and I hope that it does (though I still have concerns about the new roller brush), but as it is right now, I can only say that the Saros Z70 massively underdelivers on its promises.

    "title": "How ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’ Pulled Off That Surprising Finale Reunion",
    "article_text": "If you’ve been following io9’s coverage ofThe Handmaid’s Taleseason six, you might have caught our list of five thingsviewers needed to rememberabout season five. There was a long gap between seasons, and quite a few high-stakes plot threads to keep track of. One of the items on that list was the departure of fan-favorite character, whose absence was explained away in the season five premiere. We wondered if perhaps that person might return in season six, and, well… Yes! Alexis Bledel’s Emily, fearless fighter and noted salted caramel ice cream fan, did indeed show up for some closure in “The Handmaid’s Tale,” the series finale episode. In season five, we learned she’d left her wife and sonâafter a hard-fought escape to safetyâto return to Gilead and keep fighting. It was an abrupt end for a character who’d been so important as both a friend to June (Elisabeth Moss) as well as to the plot ofThe Handmaid’s Taleas a whole; it’s because of Emily that we learned about Mayday. She’s the reason why Bradley Whitford’s Commander Lawrence entered the story. Her experiences also illuminated the bleak life for exiles in the Colonies, as well as the genital mutilation forced upon women who refused to obey Gilead’s draconian laws. Though the character’s absence was due to Bledel choosing to leave the series, it was tempting to imagine Emily would soon pop up again. But she was MIA throughout season five and all of season six until the very end. In interviews with the Hollywood Reporter,Bledelas well asMoss and show creator Bruce Millerdiscussed how they planned her cameo. “We were both thrilled that it might work out,” Miller told THR. “I think she was really excited when we talked. The only thing that was hard was the logistics to get her up for the time we needed … It was wonderful to see her and [Moss] get right back into it after all that time.” Moss added, “She wanted to do it from the beginning. She didnât need convincing at all. My first official scene on day one [on set] was with Alexis. So it meant a lot to get to work with her again.” In a separate interview with THR, Bledel said returning toThe Handmaid’s Talewas “an immediate yes” because “it felt right to bring closure to Emilyâs journey and offer the audience a sense of completion … I hope viewers take away to keep hope alive when things seem impossible. Even if it seems like seeds you plant couldnât possibly grow, plant seeds of hope anyway. You never know; they might find a way.” The Handmaid’s Talefinale is now streaming on Hulu.

    "title": "AI Cheating Is So Out of Hand In America’s Schools That the Blue Books Are Coming Back",
    "article_text": "It’s no secret that AI iswrecking America’s educational system. With easy access to apps like ChatGPTâwhich can answer any question and also write full-fledged essays for youâhigh school and college students have begun to cheat their way through life, content to let an algorithm do the thinking, and the test-taking, for them. It’s no surprise, then, that some educators have gone analog, in an effort to stem the tide of anti-intellectualism sweeping the nation. The Wall Street Journal recentlydid some diggingand has discovered that sales of blue books have been climbing over the past year. Citing data from a number of large public universities, the newspaper notes that bulk purchases of the booklets have grown by leaps and bounds since ChatGPT’s launch in late 2022: Sales of blue books this school year were up more than 30% at Texas A&M University and nearly 50% at the University of Florida. The improbable growth was even more impressive at the University of California, Berkeley. Over the past two academic years, blue-book sales at the Cal Student Store were up 80%. Demand for blue books is suddenly booming again because they help solve a problem that didnât exist on campuses until now. Surely those of us who came of age before the current one remember the blue book as an unfortunate staple of the pre-digital educational experience. I can certainly remember filling out my fair share of them in college, and I also remember them being no walk in the park. As a student, you’re often given a very short amount of time to frantically scrawl an “analytical” essay inside of one as a means of demonstrating to your professor your “mastery” over a particular subject. I remember the pages being too small, the ruled lines being too large, and the general experience of using the dreaded booklets to be no fun. Now, however, as AItears through America’s elite educational system, lobotomizing tomorrow’s young leaders as it goes, could it be that blue books have been refashioned from a villain of the pre-AI age to a hero for our algorithmically-poisoned times? More and more, it seems like they’re the dark knight that America’s illiterate masses needs. The Journal notes that Roaring Spring Paper Products, the family-owned paper company that produces a majority of the blue books that are sold on college campuses, admits that the new AI era has ironically been good for its business. Yet while the return of blue books may be a step in the right direction, they surely aren’t a fix-all for the broad variety of ills caused by students’ AI-use. Philip D. Bunn, an assistant professor at the Covenant College in Georgia, recentlywrote on his blogthat the traditional essay (which, until ChatGPT came along, was a great indicator of a student’s intellectual capacity and was very difficult to fake unless you went to the trouble of hiring a ghostwriter) cannot be replaced by the in-class essay. Bunn writes that “the process of writing a paper outside of class cannot simply be replicated in a blue book exam, and something serious is lost if we give up entirely on the traditional essay, whether those essays are more analytic, argumentative, or research-based.” Indeed, if the return of pen and paper is a promising sign, America’s educators aren’t out of the woods yetânot even close. Arecent surveyfound that 89% of college students had admitted to using ChatGPT to complete a homework assignment. AI-detection tools designed to spot cheating alsoroutinely fail. Increasingly, America’s youth seem to view their educations as a high-stakes video game to be algorithmically juked. In short, more drastic measures (like the formulation of new laws and regulations around AI use) may need to be taken if the onset of America’s aggressive stupidification is to be halted.

    "title": "South Africa Doesn’t Think Starlink’s Plans Are So Slick",
    "article_text": "The Trump administration has reportedlyused its tariff negotiations to pressure countriesinto fast-tracking deals with Elon Musk’s satellite internet service Starlink. South Africa does not appear willing to play the game. According to a report from Bloomberg, lawmakers are calling bullshit on Starlink’s attempts to bypass the nation’s laws that require companies to have 30% Black ownership to operate within its borders. Last week, a member of South Africa’s second-largest governing partyproposeda rule change that would allow companies like Starlink to get an exemption to South Africa’s economic-empowerment laws. Under the proposal, a company could offer an “equity equivalent,” including investment in the nation’s information and communication technology sector. Such alternatives already exist for the automotive industry in the nation to account for multinational companies that want to do business in South Africa but can’t directly sell off a share of ownership to meet South Africa’s standards. But other members of the South African government aren’t willing to give in that easily. The African National Congress, the country’s largest governing party, criticized the plan for “leaving an opportunity for international players to come through the back door” and usurp the country’s own companies working in the space. Sixolisa Gcilishe, a member of the Economic Freedom Fighters party, likewise took issue with the proposal and insisted, âWe are not going to accept a situation where our laws are going to be rewritten in Washington,âper Bloomberg. The proposal came as Starlink was looking to enter South Africa’s internet market and wasmade in advanceof South African President Cyril Ramaphosa’s visit with Donald Trump, as an attempt to ease tensions between the two nations while they work through trade negotiations. Those tensions stem in large part from the Trump administration’s insistence that the South African government is seizing the land of white farmers andcommitting genocide against its white population, a claim that isnot remotely true. Nonetheless, the Trump administration haswelcomed dozens of white South Africansas “refugees.” Musk, notably a white South African, has attacked his home country on multiple occasions for what he calls “racist ownership laws.” He also claimed during arecent interview with Bloombergthat the reason Starlink can’t operate in South Africa is because he is not Black, which is alsonot an accurate description of the nation’s laws. Musk has gotten used to getting his way with Starlink, in part because the Trump administration has reportedly been using tariff negotiations togrease the wheels around the world for the company. In the months since the tariffs were announced, Starlink has gotten fast-tracked in a number of nations as Trump officials have encouraged them to do deals with American internet companies. It probably irks Musk quite a bit that South Africa is one country that won’t just roll over for him.

    "title": "Venus Harbors Secret Asteroids That Could Threaten Earth, Study Warns",
    "article_text": "Twenty years ago, Congress gave NASA a directive: find 90% of the near-Earth asteroids that could potentially harm our little world. Since then, astronomers have made major progress tracking down the rocky space debris, but a new study suggests thereâs a population of asteroids lurking around Venus that could pose a problem. These so-called “Venus co-orbitals” share a similar path around the Sun withour neighbor planetbut arenât harmless tagalongs. According to a paper under review for the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics, andcurrently hostedon arXiv, a yet-undetected group of the asteroids could pose a threat to Earth. Potentially hazardous asteroids (or PHAs) are those larger than 460 feet (140 meters) across that come within 0.05 astronomical units (4.6 million miles, 7.5 million kilometers) of Earth’s orbit. Valerio Carruba, a researcher at the University of SÃ£o Paulo, led the research. Carruba’s team suspects there are more than the 20 known co-orbital asteroids of Venus, though they may be even harder to detect. “Current ground-based observations are constrained by periodic observing windows and solar elongation limitations, though the Rubin Observatory may detect some of these objects during favorable configurations,” the team wrote in the paper. “Space missions based on Venusâ orbits may be instrumental in detecting Venusâ co-orbitals.” These asteroids also have what scientists call a âLyapunov timeâ of about 150 yearsâmeaning their orbits become chaotic and unpredictable beyond that time horizon, which is very soon in cosmic timescales. To figure out if they pose a threat, the researchers created digital clones of the asteroids and ran orbital simulations spanning 36,000 years. The team wrote in the paper that “there is a sizable population of potential co-orbitals at lower eccentricity capable of numerous close encountersâand perhaps collisionsâwith Earth.” But these co-orbital asteroids are often hidden by the Sunâs glare and are therefore only visible during narrow observation windows. The upcomingVera Rubin Observatory, expected to begin operations in July 2025, may help catch some of them. But even Rubinâsexceptionally powerful camerawonât be enough to catch the whole population. The authors posited that a space-based observatory may be the best way to spot any yet-unobserved asteroids near Venus, either with a constellation design or a single spacecraft. With even small asteroids capable of releasingcity-flattening energyon impact, finding these elusive Venus co-orbitals isnât just academicâit could bevital to planetary defense. congressNASANear-Earth objectpotentially hazardous asteroidsvenus Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "The Coolest Thing You Can Do at Disneyland for Its 70th Anniversary",
    "article_text": "If there are two things Disney fans love, it’sexclusive merchandiseandinteractive games. So, when news broke of an eventthat combined the two for the70th anniversary celebration of Disneyland, I knew the first chance I had, I was going to try it. Disneyland in Anaheim, California,just began its year-long70th anniversary celebration andone of the many, many, fun new thingsyou can do at the park is unlock it with a Key to Disneyland. The journey starts with a purchase (don’t they all?) of a $60 plastic key that measures about a foot and a half long (seen above). Just on its own, this is a cool item to display or play with, depending on your age. But this key goes well beyond that. With the key, you are then tasked with unlocking nine sections of the park. You can do this over the course of a single day, a few trips, whatever you’d like. So you go to each placeâMain Street USA, Adventureland, New Orleans Square, Bayou Country, Tomorrowland,Star WarsGalaxy’s Edge, Frontierland, Mickey’s Toontown, and Fantasylandâand find a special unlock station which looks roughly like this. Half the fun of the event is trying to find these stations, which, at times, are pretty well hidden. Of course, this event has been going on for about a week as of publication, so all the locations are out there (and I’ll detail them below in case you want a helping hand) but I appreciated how some are easier to find than others. Each is also themed to the land it unlocks, so they’re all very weird and fun. Once you find the keyhole, you power up your key and insert it. This triggers a unique event at each station, each of which has different lights, music, and even some physical things such as bubbles or projections. You will also notice that each station reveals a new light on your key (which you can see in both photos above). It makes each discovery and unlock a fun little event, worthy of a photo or video. And around the park you go, finding the stations, and unlocking all nine lights, each of which reveals a new lighting scheme and music for your key, which then carries over and you can play later. With each unlock, you get a nice little sense of accomplishment. A small, unique gratification that you are on this adventure around the park and making progress. It’s small, it’s kind of pointless, but it’s enjoyable. Especially when you it’s the icing on the cake that you’re at the Happiest Place on Earth. Once you unlock all nine lights, you bring the fully unlocked key back to the front of the park for the final station. This is the best part. There, and only after you’ve visited all the other stations, you get a special little event. Plus, a special compartment on the back of your key opens up and reveals a unique, mystery Disneyland anniversary pin. Also, the key will now play audio of Walt Disney’s speech at the opening of Disneyland. There are nine pins in total, one for each land you unlocked.Â  And, if you don’t like the one you get, you can try and trade it with pin traders around the park. My wife and I got the Haunted Mansion pin but here are all nine,courtesy of an eBay listing. At this point, you’re probably thinking, “So are you just paying $60 for a light-up piece of plastic and a tiny, random pin you may not like?” Yes, you are. And, as mentioned, it’s not really a challenge to find the unlock stations because there are often long lines at each. But there’s still a certain Disney magic in walking around this incredible park, thinking about its history, all the changes that have happened over the years, and then getting a fun little reward at the end. You aren’t only bringing home the memories, you have a few cool trinkets too. The Key to Disneyland will be on sale through the entire 70th anniversary, which runs from now through next summer. So there is no rush whatsoever.Â  You can read more about iton the official siteÂ and, if you are in need of some assistance, here’s a guide to each station.

    "title": "‘The Handmaid’s Tale’ Ended the Only Way It Could: With an Open Ending",
    "article_text": "The Handmaid’s Taleended its run this week with an episode titled “The Handmaid’s Tale,” bringing June (Elisabeth Moss) full circle while also allowing Hulu to leave the door wide open forThe Testaments,the upcoming seriesbased on Margaret Atwood’s 2019 sequel to her 1985 novel. Emotional punctuation took priority over narrative closure, which felt like the best and only choice. After last week’s big revolutionary booms, including the airplane bomb that wiped outall of Boston’s most powerful leaders, Gilead has fallenâin Boston, at least.The Handmaid’s Talehas shown us glimpses of other parts of this changed country (notably season four’s visit to Chicago), but it’s temping to forget there’s more to the fight than just the characters we have become well familiar with. “The Handmaid’s Tale” makes it clear there’s still a long way to go; the rest of what was once America requires liberation, and Luke (O-T Fagbenle), Moira (Samira Wiley), and Tuello (Sam Jaeger), among others, plan to keep moving full speed ahead. Other characters face a different sort of uncertain future. Serena (Yvonna Strahovski) is once again a woman without a country; she obviously can’t remain in Gilead, and Canada and the EU are non-options. She and Noah head to a UN refugee camp, lives still very much in limbo, though Serena has two important things giving her strength: she’s a mother, and at long last she has June’s sincere forgiveness. Battered but unbroken, Janine (Madeline Brewer) finally escapes from Gilead for good. Rather incredibly, she’s also reunited with her daughter, thanks to the newly widowed (again) Naomi (Ever Carradine), who apparently had some good in her after all. Naomi and Aunt Lydia (Ann Dowd) remain in Gilead; Lydia, at least, will play a key role inThe Testaments, which explains why we don’t see too much of her in the finale. And though we get a pretty juicy moment of fan service in the return of Emily (Alexis Bledel), a much-loved character who abruptly left the show after season fourâand we also see the arrival of June’s mother (Cherry Jones) and young daughter, who’ve been in Alaska throughout season sixâ”The Handmaid’s Tale” puts its focus squarely on June. She does a little mourning for Nick (Max Minghella), and while she and Luke don’t exactly break up, there’s a respectful understanding between them that they’re on different paths moving forward. But they do still share one big missing piece: Hannah. InThe Handmaid’s Tale‘s first season, we saw Hannah ripped away from her parents as they tried to flee Gilead’s child-hungry regime. As June endured rape and torture as a handmaid, her motivation to survive was getting her daughter backâsomething that also propelled her to stay in Gilead, as well as return there repeatedly, putting her own safety at great risk. It’s been Hannah all along, so it’s not surprising when June makes it clear to everyoneâincluding her own weary motherâthat rescue is still her top priority, along with staying in battle mode until Gilead is completely, fully dismantled: “I’m not safe, and neither are you. And they are never going to stop coming for us.” But there’s some narrative roadblocking here, since Hannah is a character inThe Testaments. Though we get a key update (she’s moved with her adoptive parents from Colorado to Washington, DC, meaning she’s geographically closer at least), that longed-for reunion is not in the cards. Instead,The Handmaid’s Talefinds a way for June to work through her grief and spread her message of fierceness and hope. Her mother and Luke both separately suggest that she should write down her experiences, leading to the meta last scene that sees June return to the bombed-out remains of the Waterford mansion, back to the room where she was confined as a handmaid, and start to dictate her thoughts. In “The Handmaid’s Tale,”The Handmaids Talethe show transforms intoThe Handmaid’s Talethe book. It’s a poignant and effective way to bring closure to this part of the storyâas the fight, we’re left to imagine, will continue to rage on. You can watch all six seasons ofThe Handmaid’s Taleon Hulu. There’s no premiere date set yet forThe Testaments. Want more io9 news?

    "article_text": "By now, everyone on Earth is aware that ex-Apple Chief Design Officer Jony Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altmanhave the biggest bromance going on, and they couldn’t keep the secret to themselves anymore. Nobody outside of OpenAI and io, Jony’s AI startup that the ChatGPT maker acquired for $6.5 billion, really knows what their AI device (or family of AI-powered devices) looks like or how it works. We haveguesses and hints from people supposedly in the know, but nothing concrete has surfaced. What we’re certain of is that Ive thinks thecurrent batch of AI gadgetsâHumane’s now-dead Ai PinandRabbit’s R1âare “very poor products.” Sir Alu-mini-um Ive might be right, or maybe he’ll eat his words.

On X, Rabbit sharedwhat is presumably an all-new UI for the R1 featuring a card-based design. It reminds me a lot of the Wallet app on iPhone. The new interface is more colorful and better surfaces many of the new features that Rabbit has added over the past year. As somebody who has kept up with the updates and uses the R1 regularly (when it’s not dead from idling), I’m digging how Rabbit is leaning into the more whimsical and fun UI. Rabbit founder and CEO, Jesse Lyu, told me post-R1 launch that the device is supposed to be a“Tamagotchi-PokÃ©dex-walkie-talkie” device. I’d say it’s getting closer to that. The addition of the “r-cade,” a digital gashapon-like way to gamify interactions with the R1 in exchange for “carrots” that can be used to redeem accessories for your Rabbit AI chatbot, already made it more toy-like. This new coat of paint seems to really drive that point homeâit’s an AI gadget, but it’s not that serious. It’s not killing phones, and it’s not going to bring about some revolution to how we use computers. But it is at least a fun little AI gadget that could act as a gateway to more AI and agentic applications. the future looks brightpic.twitter.com/OgkJF8dXps — rabbit inc. (@rabbit_hmi)May 22, 2025 The only sticking point, however, may still be the $199 price. Yes, the R1 doesn’t come with a subscription fee like the Humane Ai Pin did, and it’s now even available to buy from Amazon, but $199 may be just a bit too much for a toy, especially in this economy. Rabbit has not said whether it plans to release an updated R1 with faster hardware. I think it needs to, unless there’s some serious software optimization happening with the new UI. One of the most annoying aspects of using the R1 is that it doesn’t feel responsive enough. The current R1 UI lags when using the scroll wheel, and selecting and navigating the menu system is more cumbersome than it should be. It’s hard to say whether the blame falls on the mechanical wheel or the fact that the device uses a really weak MediaTek Helio P35 chip with 4GB of RAM. I’m really hoping the new UI makes using the AI gadget literally smoother. Not everyone will agree with me, but I remain bullish on AI gadgets like the R1. They’re nicheâand sure, I could use my phone to fire up ChatGPT, Gemini, or Perplexityâbut I also like fun, toy-like gadgets. I love to root for an underdog that’s working with small design and engineering teams. I also find it admirable that despite Jony Ive dumping on the R1,Lyu, doesn’t seem butthurt. He still reveres Ive as his “hero” and says that he welcomes all competition, “whether it’s from big companies or startups.” ChatGPT and Gemini very much destroy the R1, but my phone is nowhere near as fun to use. The same way I enjoy fiddling withTeenage Engineering’s Pocket Operatorsinstead of tapping on a MIDI phone app to make music, orusing an instant camera like the Polaroid Flip. My phone can do all of these things, but my phone also doesn’t give a damn about sucking me down endless TikTok rabbitholes.

    "title": "North Dakota Joins Growing League of States Requiring Age Verification for Porn",
    "article_text": "Moral panic laws have popped up across the United States in the 2025 legislative season.Â  Recently, North Dakota joined the growing league of states requiring age verification for porn. But critics warn that North Dakota’s regulations, which won’t go into effect until August 1, are another shining example of First Amendment violations. Last month, North Dakota Governor Kelly Armstrong (R) signedSenate Bill 2380andHouse Bill 1561which both introduced age verification requirements for websites containing a “substantial portion” of “sexual material harmful to a minor on the internet”. These sites must use “reasonable” methods, like a digitized identification card or having someone submit a government-issued ID. If a website fails to comply with age verification or deletes data, it can be held liable for damages. What counts as porn is wide under the new regulations. Obviously, actual depictions of sexual intercourse, masturbation, etc, are covered. However, the bill also extends to simulated or animated acts, and it includes depiction of pubic hair, genitals, and the nipple of a female breast, specifically. Beyond that, North Dakota’s legislation is aimed at material that “lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value” and that which the “average individual applying contemporary community standards” would consider as appealing to the “prurient interest”. According to the Age Verification Providers Association,over twenty stateshave passed age verification laws to access pornography.Â  Recently, a woman from Kansas used her state’s law tosue multiple porn websitesafter her teenage son watched porn on her old laptop. Of North Dakota’s regulations, Rep. Steve Swiontek (R), chief sponsor of HB 1561,said, “The thought was there should be some requirement and expectations that these adult’ entertainment sites who are getting paid for this…that they should be mandated and required to verify age. I think we have a moral obligation for these kids.” Per the North Dakota Monitor, Swiontek noted that the state’s laws are modeled after legislation thatUtah passed in 2023. In addition, legislators passedSenate Concurrent Resolution 4017, which requests that the Legislative Management Committee “consider studying the detrimental impacts of pornography.” The version of SB 2380 and HB 1561 that North Dakota’s legislators passed is toned down from its introduction. Originally, the bill required “covered manufacturers” (which included device manufacturers and app stores) to “determine or estimate the age of the primary user upon activation of a device”. At the time, Rose Feliciano, executive director of TechNet,saidthat the bill’s requirements were “vague, cumbersome, and ineffective.” The toned down regulations still raise significant First Amendment concerns, though.Â As NetChoice’s director of state and federal affairs, Amy Bos,wrote,“While states may (and should) protect minors, states lack, as Justice Scalia memorably put it, ‘a free-floating power to restrict the ideas to which children may be exposed.'” She added that age verification places barriers on “constitutionally protected speech” that “cannot survive judicial review.” Per Bos,Â laws in California, Utah, Ohio, Arkansas, and Mississippi “have recently failed to withstand legal scrutiny.” In addition, Texas’ HB 1181, which is similar to North Dakota’s new regulations, is nowat the center of a Supreme Court case. Bos warned, “Implementing such a measure in North Dakota would likely meet the same fate and lead to costly legal challenges without providing any real benefit to the state’s residents.” Age verification bills are also a privacy nightmare. Although North Dakota’s regulation requires all data collected for age verification to be deleted, companies often hold onto data they shouldn’t, and age verification companies still gethacked. Besides, age verification generallyisn’t effectiveat blocking access to content. But as the Electronic Frontier Foundation tracked, these laws havespiraled far beyond“protecting minors from porn”. For example, states have introduced age verification requirements for skincare, dating apps, and diet pills. EFF cautioned, “While the intent to protect children makes sense, the unintended consequence is a massive erosion of privacy, security, and free expression online for everyone.” age verificationPorn Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

The litigation claims the porn sites failed to institute legally mandated age-verification mechanisms. Rolling Stone writes that Billy Long's X account has a porn problem. Similar laws nationwide are being challenged and blocked by federal courts over potential First Amendment violations. The U.S. and Canada are fighting over the future of their economies. In that environment, all things are possible. A similar bill was blocked by a federal judge last year over First Amendment concerns.

    "title": "Telescope Upgrade Reveals Sun’s ‘Coronal Rain’ in Unprecedented Detail",
    "article_text": "The Sunâs outer atmosphereâthe coronaâis the piping hot outer limit of our star, and is usually hidden from view except during rare total eclipses. Now, scientists have gotten their clearest look ever at this mysterious region, thanks to a new adaptive optics system that scrubs away atmospheric blur, revealing fine views of the wispy plasma on the star’s surface. Researchers from the National Solar Observatory and New Jersey Institute of Technology unveiled the system today, along with dazzling new images and videos of the Sunâs corona. The findings,publishedin Nature Astronomy, show fine-scale structures in solar prominences, short-lived plasma jets called spicules, and even coronal rain: cooling plasma that falls back to the solar surface along the star’s magnetic field lines. The team’s imaging breakthrough hinges on a technology called coronal adaptive optics. Installed on the 5.25-foot (1.6-meter) Goode Solar Telescope in California, the new systemânicknamed âConaââadjusts a mirror 2,200 times per second to correct for distortions caused by the churn of Earthâs atmosphere. The remarkable technology counterbalances any would-be wobble in the telescope, thereby producing particularly sharp images of the corona. “This technological advancement is a game-changer,” said Dirk Schmidt, an adaptive optics scientist at NSO and the studyâs lead author, in an observatoryrelease. âThere is a lot to discover when you boost your resolution by a factor of 10.” Until now, solar telescopes have used adaptive optics mainly to study the Sunâs surface, the release stated. Observing the fainter corona has remained a challenge, with coronal features blurred to scales of 621 miles (1,000 kilometers)âa limit that’s existed for 80 years. But Cona now resolves features down to just 39 miles (63 km), the theoretical limit of the Goode telescope. Among the new footage captured by the team are shots of a twisting solar prominence reshaping in real time, spicules flickering on the surface, and fine, hair-like strands of coronal rain narrower than 12.5 miles (20 km). When you consider how far the Sun is from Earth, how faint the corona is relative to the rest of the star, and how much of Earth’s turbulent atmosphere the team had to cut through and correct for, the sharpness of the images is a triumph. âThis transformative technology, which is likely to be adopted at observatories world-wide, is poised to reshape ground-based solar astronomy,â said study co-author Philip Goode, a physicist at NJIT-CSTR, in the same release. âWith coronal adaptive optics now in operation, this marks the beginning of a new era in solar physics, promising many more discoveries in the years and decades to come.â The observations offer crucial data for unraveling enduring solar mysteriesâlike why the corona is millions of degrees hotter than the solar surface. The team plans to bring the coronal adaptive optics technology to the 13-foot (4-meter) Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope in HawaiÊ»iâpotentially revealing even smaller details of the Sun’s atmosphere. heliophysicsSolar phenomenastarsthe Sun Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Trump Media to Buy $2.5 Billion in Crypto to Create ‘Bitcoin Treasury’",
    "article_text": "Trump Media & Technology Group, the company that owns President Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform, announced plans Tuesday to buy about $2.5 billion in cryptocurrencies to create what it calls a “bitcoin treasury.”The company plans to raise the money by selling $1.5 billion in common stock and $1 billion in convertible debt to 50 investors, according to a press release. The news, first reported by theFinancial Timesas $3 billion before Trump Media issued a press release, comes after President Donald Trump held a dinner for some of the largest investors in his own cryptocurrency, $TRUMP, dubbed a “memecoin,” because it has no practical uses beyond speculation. Trump spent just 20 minutes at the dinner, according toseveral reportsand disappointed attendees. Crypto.com and Anchorage Digital will actually hold the bitcoin for Trump Media, according to a press release. Trump Media has already launched a finance company called Truth.Fi in February and will offer an ETF that’s supposed to be an alternative to so-called “woke” investing, asBloomberg Newshas put it. “We view Bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom, and now Trump Media will hold cryptocurrency as a crucial part of our assets,” Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said in a statement filled with the type of buzzwords and right-wing grievance the crypto industry is known for. “Our first acquisition of a crown jewel asset, this investment will help defend our Company against harassment and discrimination by financial institutions, which plague many Americans and U.S. firms, and will create synergies for subscription payments, a utility token, and other planned transactions across Truth Social and Truth+,” Nunes continued. Truth+ is the company’s new video streaming channel filled with low-rent, far-right content. But pivoting to crypto makes a lot of sense now that Trump is again the most powerful person in the country.“It’s a big step forward in the Company’s plans to evolve into a holding company by acquiring additional profit-generating, crown jewel assets consistent with America First principles,” Nunes concluded. Trump’s cryptocurrency endeavors are widely considered to be the most corrupt actions of any sitting American president of the modern era. The president makes money in transaction fees whenever his coin is bought and sold, and the crypto has contributed billions of dollars to his family’s net worth, according toCBS News. Trump’s crypto dinner last week was attended by Justin Sun, a 34-year-old crypto billionaire who was under investigation by the SEC until Trump took office in January. Sun, who was born in China and is currently based in Hong Kong, was reportedlynervous to travelto the U.S. during President Joe Biden’s tenure over concerns he’d be arrested on SEC allegations he manipulated the market for his TRON cryptocurrency. A guest list for the dinner was never released, but theNew York Timeswas able to figure out the identities of other attendees, including OAN media personality Caitlin Sinclair and former NBA star Lamar Odom, along with a host of other people from the world of crypto. Trump was previously skeptical of cryptocurrencies but had an about-face during the 2024 presidential campaign when he fully embraced the world of fake money. Members of the Trump regime are expected to speak at a crypto conference in Las Vegas this week alongside President Trump’s family members. Vice President JD Vance and “crypto czar” David Sacks are slated to attend with the president’s sons Don. Jr. and Eric Trump. The price of bitcoin was mostly steady on the news of Trump Media’s plans, holding at around $109,287, according to CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin’s price is hovering around its all-time high, which was first eclipsed last week before some modest pullback in the price. Trump’s cryptocurrency $TRUMP ticked up about 1% to $12.77 on Tuesday. Trump’s coin is down considerably since it reached an all-time high of about $75, on Jan. 19, the day before Trump was inaugurated for a second time. Trump Media’s stock price (TMTG) plunged 10% on Tuesday morning. CryptoCryptocurrenciesCryptocurrencyDonald TrumpJustin SunSEC Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "DC and Marvel Are Smashing Together Batman and Deadpool",
    "article_text": "It will probablynever happen on the big screenbut in the comic book shops, Marvel and DC are ready to team up once again.The two biggestcomic book companies just announced thattwo of their most popularcharacters, Batman and Deadpool, are going to show down across splash pages later this year. Entertainment Weeklybroke the news of the crossover, which will mainly consist of two separate one-shot comics. On the Marvel side, Zeb Wells (Deadpool and Wolverine) is writingDeadpool/Batmanwith art and cover by Greg Capullo (Wolverine: Revenge) which will be out September 17. Over at DC, Grant Morrison (All Star Superman) is writingBatman/Deadpoolwith art by Dan Mora (Batman/Superman), which will be out in November. The Marvel comic will tell a story about Wade Wilson being hired to do a job in Gotham City, which doesn’t sit well with Batman. DC wouldn’t say what its story would be about, but both revealed in addition to these one shots, there will be some “backup adventures” with other “exciting Marvel and DC character match-ups.” All of that, however, is being kept under wraps, as is another set of crossovers coming in 2026. âI don’t do many comics these days but there was no way I could turn down the chance to work with Dan Mora again, one of my all-time favorite artistic collaboratorsâand definitely no way I could turn down Batman and Deadpool!â Grant Morrison said in a statement to EW. âExpect 4th wall-busting mayhem, owls, blood, blades, and at least one giant typewriter!â “After writingAmazing Spider-Manfor 60 issues, I told Marvel I needed a break,” Wells said. “Marvel told me I could do that or I could write a comic starring Deadpool and Batman with the best Batman artist of our generation. I no longer needed a break. In Batman we’ve found someone who has even less time for Deadpool’s antics than Wolverine, but a city-wide threat from the Joker makes strange bedfellows (literally, if Deadpool had his way). It’s been a blast letting Deadpool loose in Gotham City and watching what happens.” For those wondering, this is not the first time Marvel and DC have teamed up for something like this, it’s just been over 20 years Previous crossovers and seen Spider-Man and Superman together, as well as the Justice League and Avengers. Jim Lee, the iconic artist turned CCO and Publisher at DC, explained why it’s taken so long to do it again. “It happens kind of once every generation of readers,” Lee said. I’ll leave you to draw your own conclusions as to why. The timing has to be right in that you don’t want to do these too often. You want them to feel special. It is sort of finding that right moment for both companies to come together because it is complex. There’s a lot more coordination, collaboration, approvals that have to be done. And, obviously, from the business side, you’re sharing revenue, but it’s going to be a big deal. So you want the story, creatively, to warrant the hype of it all.” Here are the two covers of the comics and you canread more over at EW. Are you excited to check these out?

PC Gamer's Lauren Morton saidAll Will Fallis nearly all of her videogamethingsstuffed into a single package: It's a building game, it's a survival game, and it's a physics game. And in just under two weeks, it will also be a game that's in open beta, so you'll finally be able to see for yourself what it's got going on. What it's got going on from a narrative angle is the end of the world: The oceans are rising, humanity is dying, and you, the leader of a small group of survivors on a rusty boat, are given the job of saving a small chunk of what's left by building a ramshackle city on one of the few small chunks of remaining land. The problem—aside from the whole \"humanity on the verge of extinction\" thing, I mean—is that this isn't SimCity, where you can slam down buildings on a happily flat Earth and call it a day. The nature of the drowned world in which you're trapped means you'll be building vertically as well as horizontally, and it all looks, well, prettydelicate. TheSteam pagesays \"you're essentially playing Jenga with human lives at stake,\" which is nicely illustrative and also a reminder that people—tiny, digital people—will be living in whatever sort of city you build, or dying in it as the case may be. The good news is that shoddy construction standards won't be solely responsible for the untimely deaths of your citizens—you'll also have the opportunity toget Frostpunk on their assesnow and then. And in the end, we're probably all doomed anyway:\"Each colony you build will deal with unique challenges, foundation layouts, circumstances and random events—like storms, mysterious structures emerging from the ocean, political coups, unexpected newcomers, food shortages, and more. Learn from your mistakes, unlock new locations on the global map, and embark on the next dangerous adventure once the inevitable calamity comes to destroy the city.\" Ah well, I'm sure we'll all do our best nonetheless. All Will Fall doesn't have a release date yet but it's set to come out sometime in 2025. The open beta will begin on June 9 as part of the upcomingSteam Next Fest, and will run until June 16.

Unfortunately, even as crossplay becomes a standard elsewhere, Nightreign's missing out. Its heroes might be battling a malevolent force that threatens to unmake all of creation, but even they can't cross the boundaries separating multiplayer platforms. If you're playing on PC, your Xbox and PlayStation comrades will have to fight alone. Sure seems like a multiplayer-focused game should have crossplay in 2025, huh? But no, Elden Ring Nightreign doesn't have crossplay,FromSoftware has confirmed. When matchmaking for an expedition in Nightreign, you'll only get partied up with other PC players. There's no in-game friends list for adding console players, and you won't be able to join password-locked parties hosted by Xbox or PlayStation users. Nightreign does have cross-regionmatchmaking, meaning you can freely party up with players on other continents. Personally speaking, it's been years since I'd wondered whether I'd be able to play with people in other regions, but I'd certainly rather have it than not. You can also disable cross-region matchmaking if you're particularly concerned about ping and connection stability, but this will likely only be an issue if you or a friend on the other side of the globe have dicey internet connections.

    "title": "Battlefront 2's huge Steam resurgence isn't a mystery when you realize it's just really good",
    "article_text": "By leaving Battlefront 2 alone, EA inadvertently created the perfect storm for a comeback. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Star warriors of all shapes and creeds rejoice: Battlefront 2 (2017) is finally getting the love it deserves. The 8-year-old FPS is enjoying a resurgence the likes of which it's never seen—on Steam, Battlefront 2 broke its concurrent player record multiple times over the weekend, topping out at over 18,600. That comfortably ranks Battlefront 2 among the most played games on Steam at the moment (it's also back in the top sellers list despite not going on sale). More impressive is that Steam is likely only a fraction of its total PC players, considering over19 million people claimed a free copyfrom the Epic Games Store back in 2021. Chances are, you remember DICE's Battlefront 2 as one ofEA's most legendary blunders. It's inarguably one of the games that helped poison public opinion against an onslaught of loot boxes, sparked by its progression system that revolved entirely around random chance. The feedback was so universally negative that EA ripped its premium currency out of the game pre-launch, and spent the next year reworking progression around XP and making those loot boxes free. The game's enjoyed a modest community ever since, though a recent assault by hackersmade it completely unplayable for a while. So why do people suddenly care about Battlefront 2 again? The boost from Andor's recent finale is undoubtedly a factor as folks look to glom onto anything vaguely Cassian Andor-shaped: Andor himself never made it into Battlefront 2, but the Battle of Scarif as depicted in Rogue One film sure did. Then there's the renewed fervor for a Battlefront 3, somewhat accelerated by Andor actor Muhannad Ben Amor's recent Instagram storysharing his 469-hour playtimein Battlefront 2, a game he \"grew up with.\" But I reckon this latest surge of enthusiasm has a much simpler explanation: Have you played Battlefront 2 recently? Because it'sreally good. Booting it up for the first time since that controversial launch, Battlefront 2 finally plays like the throwback class shooter that we envisioned in our heads when DICE brought it back. It's got tons of ridiculously pretty maps, great gunplay (DICE knows how to make shooters, go figure), a great mix of playable heroes and villains spanning every era of Star Wars, and that reworked progression lets you unlock class upgrades just by playing. And that free copy that millions of people claimed on the Epic Store? It includeseverything, including all cosmetics. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. EA inadvertently created the perfect storm for a Battlefront 2 resurgence by ripping out all the stuff that sucked and leaving it alone. Judging by my lobbies full of level 2 accounts, there are tons of new players who either skipped Battlefront 2 or weren't old enough to play it in 2017. That's all the better, because in 2025, a new player booting up Battlefront 2 is greeted with a feature-complete casual FPS unmarred by battle passes, pop-up ads, or hideous crossover skins. It's also fair to say that some of us are ready to enjoy Battlefront 2 in a way we weren't at the time. Even if Battlefront 2 had launched inoffensively, I know that 2017 me was too busy grinding ranked in Rainbow Six Siege or Overwatch to pay attention to a casual Star Wars shooter that cost $60. I was live-service pilled—enamored with hyper-competitive games that wanted me to obsess over them. Nowadays, I'm just looking for simple fun with friends. Maybe I'm not the only one? If you're looking to join the fun and missed the Epic giveaway from 2021, Battlefront 2 is also included in the basic level of PC Game Pass. But honestly,$40 for the Steam versionis a fair deal.

    "title": "Persona 5: The Phantom X is a solid RPG, but even adding gacha can't hide the fact that Persona 5's been stretched awfully thin over the last 9 years",
    "article_text": "The Phantom X is more Persona—which isn't great if you're a bit Persona-fatigued. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In the roughly eight or so years since Persona 5 made its international debut, there has been no shortage of Persona 5-related spin-offs. Even barring the influence it's had on the genre at large, numerous games, adaptations, and crossovers have expanded the world of the Phantom Thieves. It's important context to have when talking aboutPersona 5: The Phantom X, a mobile and PC game developed by Perfect World subsidiary Black Wings Games Studio launching on June 26. I got to sit down with a build of Persona 5: The Phantom X, experiencing the introduction and a good chunk of the opening section of the game, including its first Palace. A good spin-off shouldn't just rekindle feelings of Persona 5 but add something new to the mix; like Persona 5 Tactica which took combat to the grid, and Dancing In Starlight which went straight for the dancefloor. My takeaway from Persona 5: The Phantom X is that it's a perfectly solid RPG with all the trappings you'd expect of a mobile, gacha-fueled affair. But it's also leaning deep into the well of Persona 5 nostalgia, and I'm not sure if that will pay off for everyone. The introduction plays out much the same as Persona 5; you're Joker, leaping across the chandeliers, escaping the big casino heist. Then, suddenly, a new character appears and fights with Joker. They defeat the Persona 5 lead, and right as a gunshot rings out, the hero wakes up in their bed, confused and disoriented. From there, it's a few familiar but remixed beats. The strange Metaverse app pops up on your phone and won't go away, several characters with defined portraits and party member aura pop up around you, and an animal mascot (an owl this time, rather than a cat) becomes your guide through the dangers of the Metaverse and, ultimately, stealing the Treasure of someone's palace. After playing the introductory section, we jumped forward to the end of a Palace, where our assembled party was ready to send the calling card for a misogynistic former baseball star who'd been harassing women. Under the codenames Wonder, Cattle, and Closer, plus a party with a couple additional, seemingly story-unrelated members, we went in. All of it felt like Persona 5, and not necessarily in a bad way. The dungeons still have all the decor and exploration you'd hope for, characters have quite a bit of flair, and there's a good mix of lighthearted gags and serious subject matter. Battles are turn-based affairs that play just like Persona, right down to the \"1 More\" mechanic that lets you tag in a party member for a follow-up after hitting a weakness, and All-Out Attacks when you've downed all enemies. Running around the Palace or out on the streets of the real world, it all felt like Persona 5. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. There are also layers of what you would expect from an RPG with gacha systems. You can roll for new characters, feed materials and lower-rank resources into bolstering your chosen party, and there's no shortage of menus to sift through and bespoke progression items to hoover up across activities. I never ran into an energy system, if there is one, but otherwise, it had all the trappings of other gacha-utilizing games I've played. In that way, it did make me take note of just how far these games have come. My first gacha-driven games were essentially menus and screens with barebones battles, driven largely by the Sisyphean climb for higher numbers. Gacha games nowadays look incredible, though. Those like Honkai: Star Rail,Genshin Impact, and Wuthering Waves have incredible presentation, and in that same vein, once you've scrubbed away the additional icons and menus on-screen, Persona 5: The Phantom X looks and feels like Persona 5. One of the biggest draws for me so far is the proposition of an alt-universe. The context becomes important, though. Because if The Phantom X is largely rekindling good feelings I have towards Persona 5, what can it do to differentiate itself from that? In my first hour, I was enjoying the sights and sounds of P-Studio's Tokyo again; while there is some new music, The Phantom X also reuses many of the familiar beats that underpinned so much of Persona 5. It's got a similar look, familiar characters, and the same narrative drive: high-school student with a busy social life during the day, heart-stealing Phantom Thief by night. This is potentially a huge boon for The Phantom X. A brand-new role-playing game that looks, sounds, and plays like a Persona could connect with fans, especially if it's playing off the established story of Persona 5 in interesting ways. One of the biggest draws for me so far is the proposition of an alt-universe, and the ways in which that could change or remix major story events that I would have expected. Due to its gacha nature, though, its RPG systems are also centered squarely in the conventions of the genre. That means saving up some resources, rolling for some characters, and being greeted with \"buy it now\" limited-time real-money bundles after wrapping a major story moment. In a world with no Persona 6 on the horizon yet, that notion can be appealing. We also live in a world with numerous Persona 5 spin-offs, not to mention additional Persona games like Reload, or even games heavily inspired by Persona. The silver bullet may ultimately be the characters, which are often front-and-center in a gacha game, and that's no different here. Already, we got to see crossovers with the main Persona 5 cast, and with teases for more on the way plus some high production value on the super attacks (dubbed Highlights), I could see players getting attached to chasing individual characters. Even the main cast we were introduced to was fairly compelling. Wonder, the main hero, is essentially your standard Wild Card-using Persona protagonist. But Cattle, the owl companion, uses some tonfa and a mech, and Closer is a baseball star with some flashy electric attacks. I also got to see an Ice user with a cool stacking mechanic, and a support character who dropped different beats to amplify the party. Once combat gets going, it certainly feels like I'm back in Persona 5. There are building blocks here that could make Persona 5: The Phantom X interesting for those who simply crave more Persona. They'll need to stomach some of the realities of playing a gacha game, but once combat gets going, it certainly feels like I'm back in Persona 5. For those a bit fatigued though, with myself among that number, I'm wary to say The Phantom X could steal any new hearts. There's no looming pressure from the calendar, sense of urgency, or really any of the narrative rails that gave Persona 5 momentum. Without a moving, driving force behind it, the sheer glut ofstufffeels less like a rollercoaster and more like an overwhelming wall. There are social links, side quests, and even just NPCs littered about that you can talk to, but they all exist within a world structured around making numbers go up with associated price tags or time investments. From what I've played, The Phantom X feels like more Persona, for all the good and ill that entails. If this is Persona's big swing at the gacha business, it's certainly got the aesthetic right. The sights, sounds, gameplay, everything is all tuned to Persona standards. We'll find out on June 26 whetherThe Phantom Xbecomes another treasure or not.

    "article_text": "Finding the right level of brutality is a tricky business. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We're just two days away from the launch ofElden RingNightreign. FromSoft sickos around the world might be eagerly awaiting their chance to wade into a new style of soulslike punishment, but it sounds like the studio itself will be busy polishing the experimental spinoff until the last possible moment. In an interview withGamesRadar, Nightreign director Junya Ishizaki said he's both \"very excited\" and \"a little nervous\" as the launch date approaches. Considering he's about to release an unconventional rework of one of the most beloved games in the last decade, I'm surprised he's only \"a little\" anxious, but it explains why Ishizaki said the Nightreign team is \"continually tweaking and balancing\" things as the clock ticks down. \"We really try to tweak things until the last minute,\" Ishizaki said. \"We're busy fine-tuning, getting the most out of any single session. We want players to feel happy and comfortable in each session, so we're really trying to get that player comfort and that play feel just really fine-tuned until the very end.\" Balance and player comfort is already a tricky enough proposition for punishing games like Elden Ring, but it's not surprising that Nightreign might demand an even more delicate hand. If you find yourself banging your head against a troublesome boss in a traditional FromSoft Soulslike, you can always grind out a few levels. And if you fail your next attempt, all you lose is the time it takes to walk back to the boss room. In Nightreign, however, those failures have higher stakes. If your squad wipes during a boss fight, that's your entire run tanked—along with any cool build you might've assembled along the way. With that kind of all-or-nothing structure, potential frustrations like the battle royale-style circle and unlucky drops could make for a lot of misery. It's reassuring, then, that the studio is conscious of how narrow its error margins are. According to Ishizaki, that attention is paying off, because he's \"still finding it very fun to this day.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "More than 60% of Capcom's digital game sales last year were on PC",
    "article_text": "Remember the days when Capcom didn't really play with PC? A lot has changed. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If you've been with us for a while, you may recall that it was kind of a big deal when Capcom announced thatMonster Hunter World was coming to PC. (Alas, poorDauntless.) We had to wait a little longer for it than our console pals, but when it finally showed up it turned out to bea big hit—and suddenly Capcom was all about gaming on PC, saying in 2021 that it wanted PC to be itsmain platform in the future, with a target of 50% of its sales on PC by 2022, or maybe 2023. Capcom may have been underestimating the potential for PC sales growth in those estimates, as it turns out. We already know the company posted itseighth consecutive year of record profitsin its most recent fiscal report, driven by the ongoing success ofMonster Hunter Wilds, but an interesting detail that went buried amidst all the numbers is just how much of a role PC sales played in that success: As noted byTweaktown, fully 60% of Capcom's digital game sales in the company's fiscal year—and more than 54% of total game sales, including physical—belong to PC. PC has been moving steadily upward in terms of its importance to Capcom in recent years, but this is a significant surge. In the company's previous fiscal year, for instance, PC game sales account for a little over 52% of its digital game sales, and 47% of its total sales. But the real tale of the tape is in actual unit numbers: Console digital unit sales slipped slightly, from 19.7 million in FY2023 to 18.5 million in FY2024—but PC unit sales jumped from 21.6 million units in FY23 to 28.2 million in FY24. That's a big jump, without an equivalent erosion on the console side—it's down, but nowhere near as much—and to my admittedly-not-an-analyst eye, it points to a market that's been rather dramatically under-served by Capcom's focus, until recent years, on consoles. Dauntless, whose name I invoked earlier, is probably as emblematic of that as any individual game out there: Its reveal in late 2016 grabbed eyeballs in large part because it was theMonster Hunter on PC we'd all been waiting for, anddespite some shortcomingsit was a hit for the same reason—until the real deal came along tosteal its thunder. And it wasn't a fluke: Despite performance problems that have saddled it with a \"mixed\" user rating, more than half of Monster Hunter Wilds' sales in February 2025 wereon Steam. So it's good news for Capcom, and good new for PC gamers, too—with performance like that, we can beprettyconfident that PC versions of Capcom games will arrive side-by-side with console releases. Now if someone could just get that message toTake-Two boss Strauss Zelnick, we'd be all set. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "Tracking who's on the hook next, or doing the hooking. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Every time I think I've mastered a handful of new perks and patch changes, anotherDead by Daylightupdate gets me right in the gut with more Survivor-Killer combos. The horror hall of fame showdown typically introduces two Killers and four Survivors every year, along with its usual events and chapter progression. Even with a regular formula to follow, Behaviour Interactive keeps us all on our toes in ways big and small by introducing everything from refreshedDead by Daylight codesto new licensed terrors. The only problem is that information lives all over, scattered between livestreams, blogs, and Reddit. Keeping track of the kill list gets messy, so I'm rounding everything up for our collective sanity. A year for Dead by Daylight, as defined by Behaviour's roadmaps, begins in June and ends in May. The game launched in June 2016, and it's kept a regular release schedule for most chapters and characters since. Dead by Daylight just concluded Year 9; Year 10 begins in June 2025. April 2-Tokyo Ghoul (Killer: The Ghoul)May 6- Steady Pulse (Survivor: Orela Rose)June- FNAF (Killer: The Animatronic, Map: Security Room)July- 2 Survivors (Licensed)September- 1 Killer, 1 SurvivorNovember- 1 Killer, 2 Survivors (Licensed) Typically, a new chapter introduces both a Killer and a Survivor, but sometimes it's just a Killer. Character packs or half chapters make up the difference by adding another new Survivor or two. The format gets confusing, so I prefer looking at the 2025 big picture by covering two roadmaps. Dead by Daylight's next update is a licensed crossover with Five Nights at Freddy's, adding a new map and Killer to the asymmetrical horror showdown with Chapter 36 in June. The DBD Year 10 roadmap includes five new chapters, two of which add original characters, while the other three chapters are licensed. The July update welcomes two crossover Survivors we still don't officially know. Then, in September, Behavior adds more original content with another Survivor and Killer. Teasing the update's influences during itsPAX East 2025 panel, Justin Brown, product director on Dead by Daylight, revealed the end-of-summer update has its roots in \"asian horror folklore,\" and promised it'll be \"one of the most gruesome chapters ever released.\" The next Dead by Daylight Killer is Springtrap from Five Nights at Freddy's, though he'll go by The Animatronic in The Fog. Springtrap will be voiced by Matthew Lillard, and he'll also receive a Legendary cosmetic based on the FNAF movie's Yellow Rabbit costume. Springtrap's kit includes a throwable axe, so sort of like Huntress but a bit more limited. Perk-wise, he's an awfully mean endgame monster throughHaywire, revoking that sense of relief I felt any time I heard the exit door siren. There's alsoPhantom Fear, which causes Survivors to scream anytime they see Springtrap, andHelp Wanted'snasty ability to compromise generator repairs. While we don't know their identities, Dead by Daylight will add two new Survivors in a July update. Fan theories onr/deadbydaylightquickly spotted greyed out letters in the Year 10 roadmap that spelled out \"The Ones Who Live\". It's a phrase used in The Walking Dead, and even the title of another AMC spin-off series, so I agree with the general fan consensus—the next Survivors are probably Rick and Michonne.

    "article_text": "The formerly Private Division games are now published by 2K. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Four months after they were unceremoniously delisted, Roll7's stylish skate games Rollerdrome and OlliOlli World are both back on Steam. Rollerdrome and OlliOlli World wereremoved from Steamin February, a move we assumed at the time was the result of the Private Division drama at Take-Two Interactive: After some extendedcuteness and difficultyfollowing May 2024 reports that Roll7 and the Private Division publishing label were being closed, Take-Two finally confirmed in November 2024 that Roll7, along with Kerbal Space Program 2 studio Intercept Games, had been closed, and that Private Division wassold off. The sale of Private Division included \"substantially all of Private Division's live and unreleased titles,\" Take-Two said at the time. But it turns out the sale did not include OlliOlli World or Rollerdrome, as both have returned to Steam and are now listed as being published by 2K, a subsidiary of Take-Two. The delisting of both games seems a little odd in that light. It makes sense, I suppose, if you're transferring ownership from one company to another—lawyers have to do what they do and all that—but Private Division and 2K are both Take-Two companies. Why remove them from sale for nearly four solid months if you're just going to smash 'em back up under a different name? This I do not know—\"business stuff\" is probably at the root of it somehow—but it's not a mistake or misprint: 2K confirmed that neitherRollerdromenorOlliOlli Worldwere included in the Private Division sale, and that it is now the publisher of both games. Neither OlliOlli World nor Rollerdrome were major sales successes, but both are excellent: OlliOlli World earned an87% review scoreas an \"unmissable skate 'em up\" in 2022, while Rollerdrome drew an even more impressive94% scorethe same year.

There's a kid with a lightsaber at the top, the tagline \"beyond the unknown\" as well as \"May the Force be with you\", links to various other Star Wars resources, and for some reason Master Yoda is recommending Star Wars Battlefront 2, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed 2, Lego Star Wars 2, and Star Wars the Clone Wars: Republic Heroes. \"Like these games, you will\" runs the text alongside. This site,unearthed by security researcher Ciro Santilliandfirst reported on by 404Media's Joseph Cox, is one of hundreds created by the CIA from around 2010, and part of a network that was used to covertly communicate with CIA assets abroad. These sites were first discovered by the Iranian authorities, and may be linked to the killing of various CIA sources in Chinaover the period 2010-2012. Santilli's research throws up much more than starwarsweb.net. The majority of the sites Santilli has identified as being in this network seem to be news sites, with a smattering focused on areas like sports, music and gaming. Among the gaming urls involved are havenofgamerz.com, hitpointgaming.com, activegaminginfo.com, myonlinegamesource.com, and kings-game.net. To take the first example, havenofgamerz.com can again be viewedon the Wayback Machine. Promising \"the latest game reviews, previews and videos\", it claims \"nobody knows games and gamers like the Haven of Gamerz\", features a sidebar of (legitimate) gaming outlets, and a few categories for reviews, trailers and previews. It's not going to be giving IGN any sleepless nights but, at a glance, does look like a generic gaming site. Santilli says that the languages used across these sites suggest they were targeting users in Germany, France, Spain, and Brazil. \"It reveals a much larger number of websites,\" says Santilli. \"It gives a broader understanding of the CIA's interests at the time, including more specific democracies which may have been targeted which were not previously mentioned and also a statistical understanding of how much importance they were giving to different zones at the time, and unsurprisingly, the Middle East comes on top.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The role of the websites was first brought to prominence by aYahoo News report in November 2018, which detailed the \"catastrophic\" compromise of the CIA's internet communications network. A quote from that article: \"According to the former intelligence official, once the Iranian double agent showed Iranian intelligence the website used to communicate with his or her CIA handlers, they began to scour the internet for websites with similar digital signifiers or components—eventually hitting on the right string of advanced search terms to locate other secret CIA websites. From there, Iranian intelligence tracked who was visiting these sites, and from where, and began to unravel the wider CIA network.\" This was what would ultimately lead to the deaths of CIA sources, primarily in China in 2011 and 2012. This investigation was followed-up by a Reuters report in 2022,America's Throwaway Spies, which went into further detail on how individual CIA agents were exposed by the Iranians, and included the incredible revelation that the IP addresses for the CIA's sites were sequential, meaning that once one was identified it was easy to find others that likely belonged to the same network. Reuters identified two of the sites and described seven more examples, which was the starting point for Santilli's research. Using data like the IP addresses and domains, Santilli has identified several hundred domains that he believes were part of the CIA's network. \"We're now about 15 years past when these websites were being actively used, yet new information continues to drip out year after year,\" cybersecurity researcher Zach Edwards told 404 Media. \"The simplest way to put it—yes, the CIA absolutely had a Star Wars fan website with a secretly embedded communication system—and while I can’t account for everything included in the research from [Santilli], his findings seem very sound \"This whole episode is a reminder that developers make mistakes, and sometimes it takes years for someone to find those mistakes. But this is also not just your average 'developer mistake' type of scenario.\" Santilli says it's good \"to have more content for people to look at, much like a museum. It's just cool to be able to go to the Wayback Machine and be able to see a relic spy gadget 'live' in all its glory.\" Gamers do love a good conspiracy theory, but there appears little doubt that back in 2010 the CIA was operating and maintaining a network that included many gaming and nerd culture sites. It's undeniably weird to think about a cartoon Yoda being used in espionage, or some CIA spook using a front to say they \"know games and gamers\", and even more unsettling that these were some small part of an intelligence failure that undoubtedly led to dozens of deaths. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Rich is a games journalist with 15 years' experience, beginning his career on Edge magazine before working for a wide range of outlets, including Ars Technica, Eurogamer, GamesRadar+, Gamespot, the Guardian, IGN, the New Statesman, Polygon, and Vice.

    "title": "Pump noise, what pump noise? Asetek's new liquid cooler pump is so quiet 'it's on a level where you can't hear it'",
    "article_text": "And it's still good for CPUs up to 400 W, apparently. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We've come a long way with liquid coolers. The first generation was known for being loud and at risk of causing a puddle in your PC. While the latter is a slightly unfair reading of the upcoming tech at the time—a leak was uncommon and my ancient Corsair H100i is still going strong—the first part isn't. Older liquid coolers make a lot of noise, and a big part of that was the peculiar and noticeable whine of the pump running at full speed. Newer AIO coolers are much quieter, but there's a brand new technology on the horizon that hopes to do away with pump noise for good. It's called 'Ingrid' and it's the new platform by the makers of the original liquid cooler, Asetek. Asetek isn't a known brand for liquid coolers per se. That's due to it selling its designs to other companies to use in theirs. MSI, Fractal,Asus, Tryx, Phanteks, NZXT, and Corsair have all used Asetek's designs at some point or another. Some have since opted for in-house designs or other companies' tech, but Asetek remains in use everywhere, more or less. Ingrid is the next-generation of liquid cooler from Asetek. It is designed to offer a \"reduced acoustic footprint\" while retaining thermal performance good enough to keep a modern CPU chilly. It's said to be able to handle a CPU load up to 400 W, which is plenty for any gaming chip and then some headroom for overclocking—though it's not intended to beat its existing 8th Gen platform for temperatures. No, it's rather intended to keep the noise down. It's on a level where you can't hear it. You can expect Ingrid to show up under a few brand names, Antec definitely among them. The company had a new Ingrid-powered liquid cooler prototype on display atComputex 2025, and that's also where I caught up with Asetek to chat all things Ingrid.\"It's getting more and more difficult actually to get more thermal performance, because the curve is more or less at the top,\" Thomas Ditlev, VP global R&D at Asetek, says. \"I think the business for quite a while has been about thermal performance. Then it turned into bling bling. The more lights, the more LCD screens you could get. I think the next big thing is noise. Maybe trying to design, not the noise, but the sound, and turning it into instead of having a low noise, then maybe a specific noise.\" With Ingrid, Asetek claims to have built its \"best acoustic performance to date. Going one further than that, Henrik Lindskou-Mouritsen, VP and CSO at Asetek, tells me: \"It's on a level where you can't hear it.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"When it's installed, you can always hear the fans, you can't do much about them,\" Ditlev says. \"But with good thermal performance and really low noise pumps, and then you can dial down the fans, and get it close to noiseless.\"This noiseless claim is one I'm keen to try out for myself. I headed straight to Antec's booth to see its new Ingrid-powered cooler, the first of its kind. The showfloor of Computex is not an ideal acoustic testing lab, however, as it is made up of thousands of people talking, filming, and blasting music. So I actually didn't hear a thing, though not in a way that matters. I did carry out the classic 'is it on?' test of holding the tubes connecting the pump and radiator to feel for the gentle buzz of an operational pump, and there was no such buzz. I asked someone at Antec if it was actually on, and they also couldn't confirm, but noted it was a prototype, so maybe not. I put my ear up to the pump and nothing, nada, but it was really loud on the busiest showfloor I've seen in years. So, my impromptu test failed, but I'd really need to get this thing isolated from noise to give Asetek's claims a run for their money anyways.Ditlev and Lindskou-Mouritsen tell me Ingrid works by actually loosening up some of the tolerances that it had put in place for previous coolers, such as the performance-driven Gen8 platform. \"It's a lot of small things. But in general, we are loosening some of the tolerances prior we had. Basically, from our time in data center, everything needs to optimise for more efficiency. So, less power consumption was better. Now it's okay to have slightly higher power consumption. We can loosen up some of the tolerances and have a little more space in the rotating parts, so it makes it extremely low noise.\" The impact of these changes on cost should be fairly minimal as well. That's not only because widening tolerances generally makes things easier, but I'm told that Asetek has been working on this concept, or others like it, for a long time. I think we more or less reached close to the optimum on the pump side. \"So the added cost is limited,\" Ditlev says. \"I would say, R&D-wise, it's also based on the fact that this is what our R&D guys have been doing for many years. You know the old one [liquid cooler pump] was invented by us. So there is a lot of real estate for engineers that have been playing around with these crazy ideas for a long time, and now they actually had the chance to try to materialize with these ideas. So that's the good thing. We have a lot of people that have been in the company for quite some time, and they know everything about noise or thermal performance. We just allow them to play a bit.\" There will be three different tiers of Asetek Ingrid cooler: value, mainstream, and premium. You won't necessarily see this when you go to buy a liquid cooler, as it's more for added flexibility for the brands buying Asetek's cooler, but it does mean there will be options to choose from. There are other improvements with Ingrid, as noted by Asetek, including an easy installation process with around three steps, reduced vibrations, greener credentials thanks to a lessened need for rare Earth elements, and planned support for future CPUs. There are also ways to move the inlet and outlet pipes around for specific B2B solutions, but once I see the letters 'B2B', I fall into a deep slumber, so enough of that. According to Antec, the Vortex View using an Ingrid pump has a 50,000-hour lifespan. I've had a look around, and while most manufacturers don't state the exact lifespan for other Asetek pumps on their product pages, Fractal says its Celsius line-up also manages a 50,000-hour rated lifespan, as does itsLumen line-up. The difference being Celsius is, as far as I know, made by Asetek, and Lumen isn't. Presumably, that means Ingrid is on par with previous and competitor models for rated reliability, but no better. Since I had two liquid cooler execs in front of me, I was also keen to hear about where liquid coolers go next. We've apparently hit a performance wall, after all, and now we're onto near-noiseless coolers. So what's next? Where can we go from here? \"I think for many years the entire industry has been focusing on the pump, the coldplate,\" Ditlev says. \"We then could do a better radiator—somehow, not sure how, but for sure, we are looking into more. Also coming in are a lot of interesting new liquids. And I think that's where we'll see the next giant leap. That will be on radiators or thermal interface liquid. I think we more or less reached close to the optimum on the pump side.\" Something beyond the mixture of distilled water and additives, such as glycol and biocides, that currently runs through our loops could be the next change, then. An upgrade for the humble radiator seems a tougher proposition, but there's always the option for thicker radiators as standard to help buff up cooling ability. We've seen some employ these on AIO coolers already, such as theHyte Thicc Q60. Catch up withComputex 2025:We're stalking the halls of Taiwan's biggest tech show once again to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to offer. Or just stick a screen on your liquid cooler and call it a day. That does appear to be the default response from many manufacturers to the question: 'How do you plan to update your liquid cooler for 2025?'. Even the Antec has stuck a screen on its Ingrid-based Vortex View. Yet maybe there's more actual value to gamers headed our way under the big screens and bright lights. Noctua is teaming up with Asetek for itsfirst-ever liquid cooler, but this is built around the performance-focused Gen8 platform. It's designed to be super-quiet as well. That'll be a fun comparison with Ingrid once we've got our hands on both. And of course I'd like to test against the usual suspects of thebest liquid coolers, some of which are not based on Asetek designs, including the best around, theArctic Liquid Freezer III, which is also set for an upgrade with the new Arctic Liquid Freezer Pro I also caught a glimpse of at Computex. That's likely going to be the AIO cooler to beat in 2025. But one thing's for sure, I want to listen to that Antec cooler without Computex going on all around me first.

    "article_text": "I guess you do kill a lot of people in daylight. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Two months in,Assassin's Creed Shadowscontinues to trundle along quietly in the videogame background, presumably quite pleased with itself for pulling in a bunch of players and making such good use of its delays thatUbisoft now wants to delaya whole bunch of other stuff. The game's1.0.5 patchreleased today, bringing a new quest, some tweaks 'n' fixes, and—for reasons I am still turning over in my mind—a crossover with Dead By Daylight (and Balatro). First up, the quest is called Thrown to the Dogs, and will task you with aiding \"a loyal dog avenge his late master\" in some sort of rollocking tale that will—here's the crucial bit—unlock anewdog to plonk down somewhere in your hideout. This is what videogames are about, my friends. Another thing videogames are about: hot brand collabos. AC Shadows is getting a Dead By Daylight-themed event, described thusly: \"As villagers begin to disappear, Naoe becomes suspicious of the strange presence attacking the local people of Harima. To succeed, you will need to master unique mechanics and confront a formidable otherworldly threat.\" Also, there's DBD-themed gubbins available in the AC store now, which I confess I regularly forget exists and will endeavour to keep forgetting in future. If DBD isn't your style, there's a new Balatro-themed trinket that Ubi isn't telling you how to get, only that you'll have to figure it out. Patch 1.0.5 also marks another step forward inAC Shadows' roadmap, bringing with it a buffet of parkour improvements like back and side-ejects that favour \"foot landings over hand landings,\" a new toggle that stops you from ceasing to sprint when you go into parkour mode, and—most importantly—a straight-up vertical jump. That one will let you jump straight up if you're under some kind of overhang, because I bet they'd invented jumping by 1579. I've enjoyed my time with AC Shadows—as did our own Morgan Park in hisAC Shadows review—but I admit I've fallen off it a bit as the months have gone on. Just like Valhalla, I can't help but feel likeUbisofthas just madetoo much gamefor me to ever get around to finishing. But who knows?

    "article_text": "Cache was already in the Workshop, but now looks set for the competitive map pool. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Cache co-creator Shawn \"FMPONE\" Snelling has announced that Valve has bought the map outright, following its addition to the CS2 Workshop in early March, and a mention in the background of the game's latest update. Responding to player Aqua saying \"this pretty much confirms that Valve bought Cache,\" FMPONE confirmed the news: \"Thank you for playing Cache,\"said FMPONE on X. \"Thank you to Sal Garozzo for allowing me to work on his original creation for so many years. Thank you to Counter-Strike for being Counter-Strike!\" Sal Garozzo, who goes by the handle Volcano, is the original creator of Cache and, in a nice full-circle moment, is the co-lead on Riot's CS2 competitor Valorant. FMPONE went on to give a little more detail on the purchase. \"Out of respect for the development team I withheld comment,\" said FMPONE, \"but they reached out to buy it on day 1 of [the recent Workshop] release. It was a great honor and I don't want anyone to think we hesitated for one moment. \"Valve previously offered to buy the map one other time, around 2013-2015 (can't remember). They gave the option to keep it in our own hands and ride out the Operations, or let them buy it. At that time we rode out the Operations because we had total confidence in the map's popularity.\" In response to a player expressing gratitude that the map would now permanently be a part of Counter-Strike, FMPONE said he \"agreed completely\" and \"the map is in great hands now.\" One more query relates to a piece of graffiti, which was removed in the CS2 version, celebrating s1mple's absurd no-scope double AWP kill on Cache during ESL One Cologne in 2016: it's not in the current Workshop version, but FMPONE confirmed that \"Valve has the rights to this art now as well.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Cache first released in 2014, and was a part of CS:GO's competitive map pool until 2019 (it was last played competitively at IEM Katowice 2019). CS2 arrived with enhanced and reworked versions of many classic maps, but Cache was left to FMPONE: who certainly delivered, because the Workshop version is gorgeous and great to play. Valve is likely to have its own fiddle with this, but I wouldn't expect huge changes to what's already in the Workshop. As for Valve, the official Counter-Strike account simply responded to FMPONE's confirmation with anemoji of a handshake. Cache has been a fan favourite ever since it appeared on the scene, initially as a custom CS:GO map and then in a reworked and Valve-sanctioned version. It'll clearly find its way into the competitive pool soon, and Valve has added another chapter to Counter-Strike's long and proud history of community development. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Rich is a games journalist with 15 years' experience, beginning his career on Edge magazine before working for a wide range of outlets, including Ars Technica, Eurogamer, GamesRadar+, Gamespot, the Guardian, IGN, the New Statesman, Polygon, and Vice.

    "title": "'Brevity should be more of a virtue': Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's devs are happy they made an 'intense and short' 30-60 hours of RPG",
    "article_text": "Short and sweet. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is, as far as JRPGs go, relatively short. Not too short, mind—if you want to throw yourself into its endgame challenges, you'll be spending about 60 hours, and there's always New Game+ if you want to do the whole thing over again. Given Sandfall Interactive's team size (around 30, not counting contractors and the like) one might wonder if that was a problem of budget. Not so, says Sandfall Interactive's portfolio director Matthew Handrahan in a recent interview withGamesIndustry.biz. As a matter of fact, it was their intention from the very start. \"One of the things that's great about Expedition 33 is it really respects the player's time. It gives them plenty to do, and it gives them plenty of satisfaction, but it isn't arbitrarily 500 hours of gameplay. It's impactful because it's scoped correctly … It doesn't have any sense of bloat or extraneous things that are put there just to make it larger and larger and larger.\" As a matter of fact, he reckons more games ought to be trimmed down a tad, stating that \"Brevity should be more of a virtue in gaming. Something can be better by being shorter—something that's being discussed in film at the moment. Every film seems to be two and a half hours long, and I think most people are like, 'Can they all be a bit shorter, please? Because we have other things to do with our lives'.\" Hear hear. While part of this is entirely my problem—I am subscribed to two MMOs, because I hate having both free timeandmoney—I can't help but relate. Too many games are arriving at too fast a pace, all of them vying for your time, attention, and devotion. If it weren't my job to stay looped-in, I'd absolutely hunker down in my comfort zones and go nowhere else. The studio's CCO and producer, François Meurisse, also toes this line. \"From the beginning, we wanted to do an intense and short experience,\" he says, before relating to the 'too many games' thing: \"As a player, there are so many great games out there that I want to experience, [and] what's important to me is the level of excitement and fun I get from a game, rather than how long it is.\" Meurisse isn't convinced length should really enter the equation at all. \"The value that players get from games does not align systematically with the length of the game. For example, one of my favourite games of all time is Inside, which lasts about two hours.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. While I wouldn't dismiss that out of hand, as I'm sure Meurisse is aware (given his team priced Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 at a reasonable $50/£42) price does change things. Especially in a AAA industry that'sstaring down the barrel of $80 games. Sure, it's all about the experience, but most folks only have so much money to spend—and they wanna get the bang out of their buck. As far as ol' 33 goes, though? Mission thoroughly accomplished. At around 60 hours' playtime, that's about seventy pence per hour of entertainment on my end, so there's no complaints here. Well.

    "title": "Aureole – Wings of Hope is a high-speed, nifty platformer where you wrangle a supersonic, physics-based ring to eventually thwart a jacked devil",
    "article_text": "Ring around the foe-sies. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Platformers are a tricky thing to iterate on. Given they're one of the older genres in the medium, and there are only so many ways to play with the idea of 'jump over platforms, sometimes fast'—it can be hard to come up with something that feels fresh.Aureole - Wings of Hope, by Team Stargazers, has succeeded, given it feels nifty and unique as hell. Or heaven, I guess, since it sees you playing angels who are really into ring-tossing. The story is straightforward and charming enough. The Heaven Kingdom's been getting lax with its security, something that's been taken advantage of by a very buff devil with nipple-tape and a coterie of similar bad guys. You play as Ramila, a slacker angel, and Ryleth, a soldier who got wrecked during the initial invasion and turned into an aureole—a special kind of ring housing Ryleth's soul. It's this ring you'll be tossing around levels, cursing the laws of physics as you try to dash and bounce towards a high score. Mercifully, you can control the ring. You have a directional double-jump that can send it in a direction, and then course-correct you in mid-air, as well as a slam to bring you quickly to the ground and a charge-able dash that serves as a way to break—or send you shooting off at mach heaven directly left or right. Given the ring itself has its own physics, it can bounce off walls, clip ledges, and shoot up curved inclines like they're half-pipes. In fact, the level geometry itself is your only obstacle between you and an elusive gold medal—and it's deeply satisfying to pull off a speedy run. This produces a feeling not unlike playing the game's clear inspiration, Sonic the Hedgehog, except Sonic's on ice skates and he's wearing a suit made out of rubber. That description sounds terrible, but in practice, thanks to your additional aerial options? It's a ton of fun to wrangle. If you're into technical, speedrunning platformers, then there's a ton to like here. Even though I'm just starting out, I already have a lot to consider. Your charged dash can either slam you right into a wall or send you sailing over half the level, based on your height when you use it. Your ground-pound can combo into it, allowing you to hop over chasms—but it also has a little bounce of its own, letting you essentially triple-jump your way through tighter corners.

Here are the two things I know about PlayStation lead systems architect Mark Cerny: Well, today we can add a third entry to that list: he is better than me at Balatro. Per a recent post on X, \"The Everything App\" (viaGamesRadar), Cerny has joined the highest echelon of humanity—the 0.1% of players who have gotten a platinum trophy in the game on PlayStation. After seven months and hundreds of hours, proud to join the 0.1% of players that have achieved Platinum on Balatro! Kudos to @LocalThunk for the incredibly deep gameplay pic.twitter.com/vMYmOytmzkMay 24, 2025 If you're not hip to the console lingo, that means he got every possible achievement. He's slapped a gold sticker on every Joker, won with every deck on gold stake difficulty, completed every challenge run, and, well, done everything. He's done everything. His accomplishment got a shoutout from an official PlayStation brand account, which feels a bit like that picture of Obama giving a medal to Obama, but hey, heisa member of an elite few. This is Cerny's first (announced) platinum sincethe one he got in Neon Whitea year ago. I imagine he's busy designing the next PlayStation and Knack 3 and whatever else it is that people with important job titles do all day. Actually, maybe what they do all day is play loads of videogames. Cerny's not the only console exec out there bragging about his cheevos. Xbox boss Phil Spencer somehow managed to nab a100% completion rate in Vampire Survivorswhile at least notionally handling the biggest videogame acquisition in history. I'm beginning to feel like I've been hornswoggled; these guys are just goofing off with videogames all day! Someone needs to either whip them into shape or get me a seat on this gravy train.

    "title": "F1 25 review",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Wonderfully authentic, but it's too familiar, cumbersome with a pad, and the career management is unusually tedious. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. Sebastian Vettel once said over the radio: \"We have to remember these days because there's no guarantee they will last forever.\" There's an odd feeling of that here, and not only due to F1's stablemate WRC being 'paused' by EA. Rather, 2016's genius revamp of the career mode was arguably perfected in 2018 and here in 2025 it's come as far as it's likely to. And, like Vettel in his racing years following that quote, while F1 25 is obviously still great, uncharacteristic errors are starting to creep in. What is it?The 17th annual edition of Codemasters' official F1 game, if you count the Wii/PSP one.Release dateMay 30, 2025Expect to pay$60/£50DeveloperCodemastersPublisherElectronic ArtsReviewed onRTX 2070, 16GB RAM, Intel i7 10th GenSteam DeckUnsupportedLinkOfficial site Let's be clear: We're still looking at another high quality, gobsmackingly authentic racing game, but the returns are diminishing to the point it's no longer easy to recommend—even with the welcome, concluding instalment of Braking Point. Sorely absent last year, the third entry in the fictional story mode has been worth the wait in many ways, adding greater depth and drama to its returning cast of characters. Seeing drippy Aiden Jackson go from rookie to title challenger in 6 seasons has been a genuinely organic transformation and we now have his team mate California Mayer fighting for the title too. It's a shame a fictional female F1 driver is challenging for the fictional title before any real female has even made it onto the modern F1 grid. Still, from a dramatic perspective, Braking Point 3 does a great job of developing its best character: Devon Butler. The 9-hour story isn't quite worth the RRP on its own, but it's a compelling addition to the game, now offering the player much more managerial input between progressing the story. It makes you wonder how 'Braking Point' could have fared as a full-price, standalone game comprising the three entries in the style of TOCA Race Driver and its superlative first sequel. Naturally, when the characters are spouting recorded lines of dialogue there's only so much player-instigated variation that can be accommodated in the game code, so you do end up with some disappointing shortfalls. For instance, one scenario clearly intends for you to finish lower than hoped, while a secondary managerial objective requires you to win. So if you complete the latter objective and win the race, Aiden's still moping about because of his penalty, saying: \"A few missed opportunities, like today for example\". No real driver would dwell on it if they still won, and it does pull you out of the action. But that only goes to show how well everything else is delivered. From the incessantly ringing phone full of carefully interwoven sub-plots through to the way you can then take the Konnorsport team through into the My Team mode after finishing the story, it's amazing how well this entirely fictional saga fits into the F1 world. Particularly noteworthy is the email system whereby staff you promoted will message you, eagerly highlighting personal accomplishments as if trying to win your approval. It's so very human and you start to feel like you're managing an actual team, which is a first for the series despite similar systems being present in previous games. It really adds to your emotional investment. It is a bit jarring to see Max Verstappen popping up, interested in signing for this yellow-liveried team but, sure thing, why not? If Max asks to sign, you say 'yes!' You can turn off all the fictional and fantasy content—which can include having the legendary Ayrton Senna available in the driver market—if you prefer. But if you do, you'll be left with scant little else to convince you this is better than the previous six years of career mode. The greater emphasis on R&D is laborious, with part research, fabrication and deployment annoyingly split across three separate screens. More pleasingly, facility upgrades and department morale levels work in tandem with the sentiment of your fans. Do well in inter-team rivalries and you can win fan support, bolstering your negotiating powers in sponsorship deals and driver signings. If anything, there's a little too much emphasis on the logistical side, as playing the game really does become a job. In Braking Point 3, at one point you are so overwhelmed with managing the team and emotional turmoil, you might start to wonder where the fun is. It genuinely feels like work, instead of being a recreational way to realise your childhood dream of being a racing car driver. So let's put the heavy stuff to one side and focus on that core driving experience. After the furore surrounding last year's handling model, pad control is unfortunately the worst it's been in over a decade. It's important to have some degree of steering input dampening at high speed because no racing driver would see-saw at the wheel on full lock while going down hangar straight, which is what you'd essentially be doing when you waggled the analogue stick left and right. Trouble is, this woolliness is now too heavy handed, resulting in alarmingly spongy, cumbersome steering when you're trying to correct oversteer on the exit of a fast corner. Inexplicably, any kind of traction control assistance exacerbates this effect. You want to snap the car straight with a flick, but instead your correction veers you off the road, the car unwilling to turn like it's a laden shopping trolley. The driving in general feels heavier than usual and seems to need you to brake more in order to get round corners that used to be easy. Turn 4 at Bahrain has always been tricky, but navigating it is so laboured here it just doesn't feel right. It's better with a steering wheel where you get 1:1 movement with the front wheels, but pad control has always been so good in the F1 series that this noticeably feels changed for the worse. There are a few uncharacteristic bugs, too, like odd or incorrect radio messages, uneven engine sound audio mixes and subtitle text that sometimes contains spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. It feels harsh to criticise the game for what it doesn't do perfectly when so much of it is so astonishingly well constructed, weaving as it does all of the various influences into a cohesive and expansive campaign. But while the game frequently points out what's objectively new, subjectively it feels all too familiar. New features like some tracks being available in reverse and some LIDAR-mapped courses being authentic to actual race weekends are all well and good, but they don't improve the gameplay. If this is your first F1 rodeo, you'll be in heaven, but for anyone else, it's underwhelming. There is a third pillar besides Braking Point and career, however, and it shouldn't be overlooked as it offers a meaty and satisfying online-integrated experience: F1 World. This again offers a quickplay series of events based around loot and upgrading your bespoke F1 car. It's largely unchanged from its '23 debut but does nevertheless offer an appealing and enjoyable side mode, especially if you're low on time or attention span. The game is far stronger for its inclusion, even if the emotes you can win are absurd. So the 'three games in one' I championed two years ago are evident here, only two of them aren't as enjoyable as before, and the other feels mostly unchanged. Tech-wise, you get modern bells and whistles like path traced lighting, which does look very nice, but is restricted to graphics cards higher than an Nvidia 2070. That graphics card will still provide a playable but comparatively low frame rate with standard ray tracing enabled at 1080p, and will even give you a very smooth experience on Ultra settings with ray tracing disabled at the same resolution, but it's interesting to note the early RTX series is starting to become outdated. Played on a newer card, however, the path traced lighting and newly rendered tracks look sublime. There are a few uncharacteristic choppy moments, particularly at Spa Francorchamps, but with so many variables it's hard to point to exactly why that is. Still, for the most part it is well optimised and looks incredible when running smoothly, and scandalously pretty at 8K60. Sadly, despite the commendable upgrades, F1 25 feels like fundamentally the same game for arguably the 7th year in a row. Combining F1 World, Braking Point's return and career mode, it's very,verysimilar to F1 23, only not as fresh or as enjoyable as that game felt on release. It's not practical or even possible to keep rebuilding a game this big from the ground up year after year, that's understandable, but when so much familiar content is being repackaged as a full-priced iteration, it feels like a more radical change is needed soon. Most tellingly, last year's F1 24 felt like an 'off year' as it didn't have Braking Point in it, but—for the first time ever—even this 'on year' feels stale. Wonderfully authentic, but it's too familiar, cumbersome with a pad, and the career management is unusually tedious.

    "title": "Cities: Skylines 2 can't catch a break, as the long-awaited Bridges and Ports expansion is delayed again",
    "article_text": "Initially due in 2024, it's been pushed back again until late 2025. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Cities: Skylines 2's had a rough ride since it launched in 2023. There's no denying that Colossal Order has made some substantial improvements to the wonky launch build in the nearly two years since it arrived, but it feels like the team is constantly juggling a variety of issues. In the original post-launch roadmap, which went up to the second quarter of 2024, one asset pack and one expansion were teased. The asset pack, Beach Properties, launched as expected in early 2024, but it wasso threadbare and poorly receivedthat Colossal Order and publisher Paradoxissued an apology a month later, doled out refunds and gave it to everyone for free. The first expansion, Bridges & Ports, was expected to appear within a few months of Beach Properties, but that never happened. In September 2024, the team announced that it wasdelaying the expansionso it could improve the base game. It eventually got a release window of the second quarter of 2025. So around now. Well, that won't be happening either. \"We've spent the last five months working hard on the Bridges & Ports DLC, and towards our upcoming expected release,\" Colossal Order explained over on theCities: Skylines 2 forumtoday. \"After reviewing the content ourselves and sharing it with our early access group, we've received consistent feedback: the bridges are super exciting, and the port works well, but there are aspects of the expansion that are not as polished as they could be.\" With that in mind, the expansion has been pushed back. \"In the meantime, we're assessing feedback from our early access group and mapping out what we want to improve when the expansion launches—which we are now expecting in Q4 of this year.\" This does feel a bit inconsistent, though, and the lack of specifics has given me pause. \"Polish\" is increasingly used as a catch-all term, when it technically suggests that only very minor changes are needed. It's hard to imagine an experienced developer needing four to six months to polish an expansion. Colossal Order also mentions that it wants to \"add more depth\", which, again, doesn't feel like a simple polish. And the part about \"mapping out what we want to improve\" suggests that the issues aren't clear cut at all. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. All that said, a delay sounds like a good idea. Cities: Skylines 2's problems started because Colossal Order and Paradox released it far, far too early. It was badly optimised, full of bugs and fundamental features did not work as intended. Players felt like they'd bought into a beta, and while in this age of early access launches that's pretty common, Cities: Skylines 2 was sold as a finished game. I'm still hopeful that Cities: Skylines 2 will turn into the game I was hoping for. The asset editor will certainly help with that, unlocking so many more possibilities for modders—which was critical to the first game's success.But that still seems like a long way off. The good news is that the free update that was expected to launch alongside the expansion is still coming soon. It will arrive on June 11, \"with a bit of content that gives a slight sneak peek of what is to come in the expansion\". Fraser is the UK online editor and has actually met The Internet in person.

    "title": "CDPR didn't put harsh themes in Cyberpunk 2077 or The Witcher 3 'for the sake of edginess', but because 'you're probably not making art' if the devs are never challenged",
    "article_text": "\"We do heavy things if we have something meaningful to say.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's not exactly news that Cyberpunk 2077 and The Witcher 3 both grapple with heavy-hitting themes—but there are a few stand-out moments that can really crawl under your skin. For me, just about all of ol' 2077 was a bit of an existential nightmare, though it was one I was thoroughly enthralled by. Speaking to our friends atGamesRadarabout theBloody Baronand Sinnerman questlines—which cover themes of miscarriage and domestic abuse in The Witcher 3, and crucifixion in Cyberpunk 2077, respectively—senior quest designer Philipp Weber says that no-one in the studio takes grappling with such themes lightly. Weber insists thatCD ProjektRed doesn't \"do heavy things for the sake of edginess … We do heavy things if we have something meaningful to say, and then we also dare to go there.\" He also adds that \"the Bloody Baron, for us, really is the benchmark\". In regards to Sinnerman, Weber freely admits that there were \"people in the studio who had problems with it,\" though he argues that's part of the point: \"I would say that if you never have that discussion, you're probably not making art, if there's never a question of 'maybe we actually have to be brave, dive deeper'. Maybe there's something that could also touch people the wrong way. Are we ready to do that? And I think those are discussions that we have to this day, but I think it's important to have them, because otherwise you're never able to do something like this.\" It's an interesting line to walk. I'm personally not sure if I'd want every single game I play to be made by devs pushing themselves to dance around cultural lines in the sand and harsh themes—sometimes you just want to play a silly little shooter and see a number go up, and not everything has to be an R-rated miseryfest. All artforms have their escapist fantasies and their challenging texts. But even when I think of the memorable pieces of art from my childhood, it was often memorable because it did brush close to some of those lines. Avatar: The Last Airbender wouldn't be half the show it was if it shied away from Firelord Ozai's abuse of Zuko, or Aang's rage at the air temple's destruction, or the fact there is no war in Ba Sing Se—and that was a show made for kids. Conversely, games that do shed their harsher elements tend to have lesser stories for it.Dragon Age: The Veilguard's story suffered, in part, because it was thoroughly sanitised and felt more likeThe Avengersthan anything else. I rarely felt challenged by the story so much as I was served it on a silver platter, with a shot of Gaviscon to wash it all down with. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. I suppose it's all anchored in what you're trying to do. At the very least, I can agree with Weber that if you never have hard conversations, you're probably missing some sort of trick. And it's hard to argue with the results, given how tremendously impactful The Witcher 3 has been on the whole of gaming culture. There's a reason we threw a whole feast of interviews during its10th birthday last week.

    "title": "Dragon Age creator says EA execs thought BioWare fans would eat whatever slop they were given since 'the nerds in the cave would always show up for an RPG, because it was an RPG'",
    "article_text": "Which worked out very well. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Peter Mandelson, the oleaginous right-hand of Tony Blair's Labour Party in the late '90s, once remarked to a colleague that the party had no need to focus on its traditional voter base, and could safely dedicate itself to chasing more affluent, middle-class, conservative voters. After all, said Mandelson, its base had \"nowhere else to go\". Don't worry, I promise we'll get to Dragon Age. 14 years of Conservative Party rule later and you might think that kind of reasoning has been proven bankrupt, but only if you underestimate the powerful minds of the world's corporate executive class. It's not quite as consequential as the direction of British politics, but it turns out that EA had its own version of that thought process when it came to running BioWare in the 2010s: a notion that RPG fans would gobble up whatever you chucked their way so long as you could plausibly call it an RPG. Instead, they thought, BioWare should focus on making games that appeal to people whodon'tusually play RPGs. So says David Gaider, creator of the Dragon Age setting and BioWare veteran, in a recent chat withGamesRadar. Per Gaider, EA bosses used to refer to RPG stalwarts as living \"in the cave.\" That'd be the nerd cave, you see, where the nerds lived. \"You made an RPG and the nerds in the cave would always show up for an RPG, because it was an RPG.\" With EA bosses convinced that the nerd cave would spill out its denizens to any game with BioWare on the box, their philosophy became that \"You didn't have to try and appeal to them. You had to worry about the people who weren't in the cave, which was the audience we actually wanted, which was much larger.\" Which is how you ended up with the decidedly more \"action-y and slick\" cinematic focus of games like Mass Effect 2, 3, and Andromeda, as well as Dragon Age 2 and Inquisition (and, hey, probably Veilguard too). Gone were the crunchy stats and behind-the-scenes dicerolls from BioWare of yore—this was the era of spectacle. And, to be fair to the execs for just a second,someof those games were bangers. BioWare did thread the needle on at least a few of them. But Gaider wasn't thrilled as things were increasingly pushed in that direction and away from BioWare's roots. \"I was always trying to push it to our traditional mechanics,\" he says, \"and that wasn't very welcome in the EA sphere.\" Gaider left BioWare in 2016, first heading to Beamdog (of Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition fame) and then to his own studio at Summerfall, currently working on an \"unholy roguelite deckbuilder\". That meant he dodged the release of what might be the ultimate expression of EA's action-obsessed executive philosophy:Anthem, which was not a good game. Not even the nerd cave turned out for that one.

    "title": "A fabric-covered PC case was not on my Computex 2025 bingo card but I'm surprisingly into it",
    "article_text": "Tryx is pushing the boat out with its new products this year. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A fabric-covered PC case would usually spell disaster and yet I'm all over Tryx's new chassis. It's called the Tryx Flova and it's covered head-to-toe in a breathable fabric. Breathable being the key word there. The front panel of the Flova is actually coated in the stuff, which means any fans you might have sat behind it are going to be pulling air through it. That's likely to cause some degradation to performance—even a fine dust filter will impact airflow—but Tryx has thought of an alternative. The Flova comes with a cross-flow fan that is mounted to the side of the tempered glass side panel and pulls in air from the length of the vent. This works in conjunction with the fans behind the fabric, so if airflow was any issue through that breathable fabric, it shouldn't be a dealbreaker. That cross-flow fan sounds pretty interesting anyways, just as a thing to use in other applications, though I wonder if it's slightly less reliable or louder than a traditional fan design. There's also fabric along the power supply shroud, which also surrounds the front panel IO. That's in an odd place, floating on the side panel, but it could work with the PC sat atop of your desk, rather than under it. This case comes in black, white, and pink. Or at least those are the colours Tryx had ready to show off at the show. An important detail for the pink case, and the thing that makes it look especially good, is the full pink motherboard tray, mounts, IO covers and even storage cages on the rear. On all three case colours there appear to be colour-matched wooden feet, too. A lighter finish for the white and pink cases and a darker one for the black. That's a nice detail. I don't have much more to share on this case right now, such as price or availability. Tryx has little more available bar a few basic details in its provided information.

It's called Arcvision and it has a curved screen built into its side panel. The AMOLED screen looks pretty familiar; it looks a match for the one loaded onto theTryx Panorama 360 liquid cooler, but it might be slightly easier to spot it on the outside of the Arcvision than inside a case through a tempered glass side panel. At least, it might be better for monitoring stats on a PC case, whereas a cooler mount is better suited to just showing off. Tryx suggests the curved tempered glass on the Arcvision is a great complement to a Panorama cooler, meaning it thinks you should just go with screens on both. The display on the Arcvision is an optional extra. You can also swap it for one of a few different panels. Once again, there's not a great deal of information available as to when we'll get our hands on the Arcvision, but presumably we'll see Tryx launching everything at its booth within the next 12 months or so. We should hear more about Arcvision, Flova, and fishtank-style Luca and airflow-optimised Luca Air cases in the near future, so keep an eye out for that.

    "article_text": "And yes, I'm including RGB on my hit list. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I'm a staunch defender of the dull, the drab, the plain, the 'oh yeah, I didn't notice that.' And nothing has reminded me of my proclivity towards all things seemingly mundane than Computex 2025 and all the resultant ooh-ing and aah-ing over extravagant tech. I know, I know, tech shows aresupposedto be gaudy and extravagant, and they are just so every year, but these consumerist fever dream pills never get easier to swallow. In fact, as I get older, it gets more difficult. What am I talking about? Everything from AIO shelves for displaying figurines, a million-and-one screens attached to things that don't need them—giant CPU cooler screens, cases withbuilt-in screens, bendy cooler screens thatmove around for seemingly no reason—and just about as many convoluted PC case designs. Now look, I'm not denying there's something impressive about aPalico PC case with an RTX 5070 Ti built into its sword, but it's impressive in the same way that lifelike wax sculptures of people are: They're eye-catching and quite the creative feat, but you won't catch me slapping one down in the home office. And that's just thegoodPC cases. Don't get me started on the likes of thosecoffee cup-shaped monstrosities. Sometimes I feel like a lot of time could be saved by just pulling aside designers early on and asking,Why? Listen, I'm not judging. Everyone's tastes are different, and I'm not saying I'm right—but I am right. It didn't take me long to find some things I do like the look of at this year's Computex, though. Upon discoveringNoctua has created its own PC case, I had my boring equivalent of a normal human being's excitement: 'Ooh, a Noctua case for an all-Noctua build. I hope it's very plain and brown.' Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. I wasn't disappointed. It would look great under my plain and brown (but very stylish!) desk. Noctua gets it, y'see. I also did find something shiny that I could get behind, this being thePNY Iron Core series of RTX 50-series graphics cards. But that's primarily thanks to the underside of the design being very plain—just a flat, shiny surface, not too much going on other than the RGB arrow, which I suppose I can put up with if I must. I wasn't free from having my nostalgia muscles massaged, either.Silverstone's new retro PC casegot me longing for a time long past… but that's hardly the same as an endorsement of a design on its own terms, is it? And anyway, it's abeige, '90s themed PC case—the whole point is it's kind of plain. It's not all minimalist designs that got me almost-but-not-quite riled up this year, either. No, I was pleasantly surprised to find my favourite design improvements to be on the most boring component of them all: the power supply. Catch up withComputex 2025:We're on the ground at Taiwan's biggest tech show to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to show. The first of these was aPSU with thermal sensorsthat can help shut off overheating GPU power cables, which will be an extra level of security for high-end RTX 50-series graphics card owners. But if that isn't quite exciting enough for you, we also saw aPSU with a power connector that swivels, allowing you to orient the entire power supply in different directions inside your case for more versatile cable management. Who needs anything more than that? Not I, that's who. Admittedly I am someone who is currently sitting with aFractal Design Define R4under their desk—a veritably plain slab of a chassis. So no surprises there. But come on, would youreallytake a side-panel LCD over a twizzly PSU connector? Oh, you would… Well, I stand by it anyway. The only real debate occurs for me when I see something likeHyte's latest bubbly case. It's kind of minimalistic, but equally… strange. Good job Hyte, you got me. I can't fit this one into my neat and tidy dichotomy. Bubbly cases aside, I think my black-and-white thinking holds pretty firm across the other products we saw this year. Now choose your side—the right one, or the wrong one—and prepare for Computex 2026. Jacob got his hands on a gaming PC for the first time when he was about 12 years old.

    "title": "I've seen every PC case that Computex has to offer and this new Havn chassis is my top pick thanks to its abnormally large fans, front grille and airflow optimisation",
    "article_text": "I've seen heaps of new cases at Computex this past week but one PC case left a strong impression: Havn's BF 360. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. This year's Computex tech show in Taipei was filled with new and lavishly designed PC cases. Some big, some small, some in the shape of cats with swords from popular videogames. Yet one stood out to me more than most, and that's the Havn BF 360. Available in black and white, Havn has stuck with a design not that dissimilar to theHavn HS 420, which was the brand's first case and our pick for thebest PC caseright now. That's a good start, with the BF 360 retaining a lot of what I liked about the bigger model: chunky cable management channels, and room for plenty of fans. Big ones. On that last point, there's room inside the BF 360 for case fans up to 180 mm in size. Havn will sell this case with or without fans, but the former might be the way to go, as you'll be getting a set of two of Havn's own H Series 180 mm fans and a 140 mm fan in the rear. These are all of Havn's own design, and the largest, the 180 mm fan, is 40 mm thick. Havn says that makes for the longest fluid dynamic bearing in the biz, which aids in stability and durability, but all I can say after having held one at Computex is that it's a real chunky lad. You can fit four of these 180 mm fans in the BF 360: two in the front, two in the top. Or various configurations of smaller fans, including space for two 360 mm radiators. Those front fans should generate heaps of airflow and relatively low RPMs versus smaller units, with the BF 360 design aiding airflow with a sloped PSU shroud. It slopes towards the front of the case, which allows for air from the lower of the two front fans to be scooped up and thrown right at your graphics card. There's reportedly been quite a bit of trial and error to nail the correct shape of this well and here's hoping all that makes for a cool-running PC at the end of the day. \"So it basically directs all of the airflow to the GPU,\" says Steven Levitt from Pro Gamers Group, the company that created Havn. \"We've noticed other cases using this sort of method that's a bit similar, but we've tested this against all of the high airflow cases on the market, and we're number one for CPU and GPU performance. That's in our own testing. It's a bit biased, obviously, coming from us, but we've done a lot of work to really try and try and make this amazing.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Catch up withComputex 2025:We're stalking the halls of Taiwan's biggest tech show once again to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to offer. I do have one minor complaint about the design of this case: the backside panel is a bit boring, compared to the Havn HS 420. I prefer the striped look which the HS 420 offers, to allow air to travel through fans or a radiator mounted to the side of the motherboard. It feels like a distinctly Havn appearance, one notably lacking from the bland, flat panel on the BF 360. I suppose something has to give on this presumably more affordable case. Underneath sits a single fan controller, one fewer than the HS 420, though the BF 360 is a lot smaller and doesn't need the coverage quite as much. There's also room for HDD and SSDs in the back. I asked Havn for a price estimate and I was told it's aiming for under the HS 420, but that it's still determining the actual cost. A ballpark figure has it only marginally cheaper at around the £200 mark, but it might not end up that way, we'll have to wait and see. There is one more case at Computex with large front fans. Tryx's Luca Air has two 200 mm fans loaded into the front, which are only slightly thinner than Havn's 180 mm fans at 38 mm. So maybe these sorts of large fans will become a bit of a trend in coming years. Jacob earned his first byline writing for his own tech blog.

    "title": "After 4 years, Final Fantasy 14 finally has a new exploration zone in the Occult Crescent—and even if I'd have liked one sooner, I can't wait to get stuck in",
    "article_text": "You're as beautiful as the day I lost you. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. For grumpy old Final Fantasy 14 enjoyers like myself who won't stop banging on about how the gamedoesn't have midcore content—good news! The game has midcore content now, and we can finally shut up until patch 8.0. Released inPatch 7.25today, the Occult Crescent, a new Bozja-style exploration zone, is now open to the public. In case you're unfamiliar with what these are, an exploration zone (officially dubbed a \"field operation\") is a piece of large-scale world content, typically accompanied with its own levelling system. You enter them solo, but will be passively thrown into large boss fights and FATEs with other players. In terms of difficulty, they're often in a sweet spot: You'll absolutely die if you aren't paying attention, but you won't wipe the entire group if you do. Because of their relative lack of required organisation, but emphasis on personal responsibility, exploration zones are the most midcore of midcore content that FF14 gets, taking the world quest model of a game like WoW and fleshing it out into its own proper progression system—with a few zone-specific grinds to keep you invested. The Occult Crescent is no different. As the patch notes explain, you'll be able to grind EXP for both your \"knowledge level\" and your \"phantom jobs\" while inside the zone. Knowledge level is your overall power—letting you deal more damage to enemies of higher levels—whereas phantom jobs are their own separate system, giving you access to new abilities and passive effects. These phantom jobs seem to be the core crux of the zone—we already know we're getting chemist, ranger, berserker, geomancer, samurai, bard, freelancer, cannoneer, monk, oracle, thief, time mage, and knight. But the patch notes state that there'll be more available either through purchasing them, or via critical engagements (boss FATEs you can get pulled into on occasion). One neat element is that, apparently, maxing out a phantom job will give you \"the Phantom Mastery status, which grants increased damage dealt and other helpful effects, and remains active even should you change to another phantom job.\" In other words, if you want to reach bonkers levels of power while in The Occult Crescent, you're incentivised to max out every job you can. Once your knowledge level is 20, you'll also be able to tackle The Forked Tower—an up-to 48 person raid that's accessed via offering something called a sanguine cipher at a special reliquary. Given how busy the zone is bound to be at launch, you'll probably be vying for a spot—you can offer more ciphers for a better chance at entry, and fortunately, if you aren't picked to go dungeon delving, your ciphers will be returned to you. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. There are other side-activities, as well, including treasure hunts at the behest of little goblin pots—but this all sounds like a jolly good time. My only gripe is that it's taken this long for us to get something like this from ol' Square Enix. Four years, in fact—nearly five. Bozja, the last field operation, came out during Shadowbringers in October 2020. Square Enix skipped over the content type for Endwalker, electing to add variant dungeons instead which, while fun, were also one-and-done gauntlets you could knock out in about eight hours. I had a great time with them, sure, but if you're playing an MMO? You gotta grease the wheels with a little grind. Due to a combination of Dawntrail's sluggish release schedule and weird prioritisation of raid tiers and extreme fights, The Occult Crescent—the most accessible and longest-lasting type of content the expansion will have to offer, bar none—has taken nearly a full year to arrive after the expansion's release. Why? I couldn't tell you. On the plus side, this is a great expansion for something like this to arrive in. Square Enix has been popping off with itsfight design recently, and despite my complaints about how long it's taken, I can't wait to get stuck in.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Saberis part of the Fate/Stay Night collaboration happening in version 3.4 ofHonkai: Star Rail. Unfortunately, you can't claim her for free like Archer. Yeah, I'm pretty bummed about that too. Sorry Saber, looks like it's over before your banner even begins—I have a Sunday rerun to save for. To make her the best she can be, you'll need to collect all ofSaber's Ascension materialsandTrace materialsfirst. Make sure you take a nosy atSaber's kitandEidolonstoo, to see if her playstyle sounds worth some extrabannerpulls or not. Keep in mind that all information on this page is sourced from beta leaks found onhoneyhunterworldandhakush, so stats and skill descriptions are almost guaranteed to change before Saber's actual release. Don't worry,this page will be updated right up until Saber's release in version 3.4, so keep checking back if you want a clearer picture of what her final kit will look like. Saber's ascension materials in Star Rail are: You need to take on the 'Shape of Gloam' Stagnant Shadow boss to collect A Glass of the Besotted Era. Whereas killing Antimatter Legion enemies, taking on certain Golden Calyxes, and collecting the right assignment rewards are the best ways to get Thief’s Instinct, Usurper’s Scheme, and Conqueror’s Will. You can also take advantage of the Omni-Synthesizer to exchange other materials to get what you need to ascend Saber instead. This is a good way to save Trailblaze Power and fuel if you've just finished a recent farming spree, or have a lot of extra materials rattling about your inventory. Saber's trace materials in a Star Rail are: This is the total you need to bring all of Saber's traces to their max levels. So you don't actually have to farm this much if you're not interested in maxing out her skills and passive boosts. As for the materials not mentioned in the section above: Destroyer’s Final Road is obtained from the 'Supply Zone' Echo of War, and farming the 'Scalegorge Waterscape' Bud of Destruction (Crimson Calyx) is the best way to get Borisin Teeth, Lupitoxin Sawteeth, and Moon Rage Fang. Again, you can use the Omni-Synthesizer to exchange other things to get these trace materials, but you can't use the Omni-Synthesizer to get Tracks of Destiny. These are obtained by taking part in events, the Simulated Universe, spending your currencies at the Embers Exchange and Starlight Exchange shops, and levelling up the battle pass. Saber is a five-star Wind attacker of the Destruction path. A little rude to introduce her at the same time that Blade—another five-star Wind attacker of the Destruction path—is getting a buff. Here's hoping it's a good buff that can keep up with Saber's kit! That said, not all characters of the same path or element play the same, so to help you understand how she works, here'sSaber's kit: The percentages above are calculated from Saber's level one skills. To break Saber's kit down into its simplest terms: more Core Resonances equals more damage. You accumulate Core Resonances by using Saber's enhanced basic attack, skill, technique, when entering battle, and when an ally uses their ultimate. So Saber benefits from being on teams with allies who use their ultimate a lot, as they not only give her more Core Resonances when activating an ultimate, they also increase her personal damage. Also, remember that after you use Saber's ultimate, her next attack is fixed as being 'Release, the Golden Scepter', essentially enhancing it into a skill that you don't have to use skill points on. There's a few things you have to balance with Saber's energy regeneration and timing as well, but as she can store energy past her maximum amount, taking advantage of these additional buffs shouldn't be as hard as it initially seems. If you've got a fat stack of Stellar Jade burning a hole in your virtual pockets, then getting Eidolons by pulling multiple copies of Saber on her Banner is something you might want to consider. However, for the average player, I'd advise against going for Eidolons, as your pulls are often better spent on getting a character's weapon, or saving them for another character.

Phainon is a five-star Physical attacker of the Destruction path. Not all characters of the same path play the same, however, and Phainon is particularly unique with his fancy two-form gameplay. So to help you understand how he works, here'sPhainon's kit: The percentages above are calculated from Phainon's level one skills. Okay, so what does that wall of text actually mean? Basically, Phainon has a regular form, and an enhanced 'Transformation' form. Apart from the three bonus abilities, anything without 'enhanced' in its name above is what Phainon's bog standard kit looks like before you use his ultimate, and anything with 'enhanced' is what Phainon's kit changes into after you use his ultimate. As his enhanced skills send Phainon into god mode damage territory, your goal while playing him is to activate Phainon's ultimate as often as possible to stay in his enhanced form. Unlike most ultimates, however, you don't use energy to activate it. Instead, you need to reach twelve points of 'Coreflame'. Coreflame is accumulated by using Phainon's skill, when Phainon is the target of an ally or an enemy's ability, and—once you unlock his second and third bonus abilities—when Phainon receives energy regeneration ability effects provided by teammates, and when his Transformation state ends. If you've got a fat stack of Stellar Jade burning a hole in your virtual pockets, then getting Eidolons by pulling multiple copies of Phainon on his Banner is something you might want to consider. However, for the average player, I'd advise against going for Eidolons, as your pulls are often better spent on getting a character's weapon, or on another character entirely.

    "article_text": "“I am proud to be among the first CEOs to use an avatar in an earnings call,” When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. With AI being on the lips of almost every CEO, it makes some sort of poetic sense that the lips of every CEO may soon be AI. In a recent earnings call, Zoom CEO Eric Yuan, used his AI avatar to address those tuned in. The avatar replaced the usual camera footage of Yuan talking to a webcam, with a slightly surreal generated video of, well exactly that. The result is a fairly realistic looking version of Yuan matched to his voice to deliver the earnings report in his stead.“I am proud to be among the first CEOs to use an avatar in an earnings call,” says the slightly off face of Yuan that almost looks like the eyes were stuck on. “It is just one example of how Zoom is pushing the boundaries of communication and collaboration. At the same time, we know trust and security are essential. We take AI-generated content seriously and have built in strong safeguards to prevent misuse, protect user identity, and ensure avatars are used responsibly.” You can get a look at the videohere, and Yuan shows up at just over the two-and-a-half minute mark. TechCrunchnotes Yuan isn't the first CEO to use an AI generated avatar like this, as we've seen Klarna CEO also show up in avatar form to address investors. This could be the new trend in AI generated CEOs, or at least that's what Zoom is hoping for. It marks the start of a roll out for Zooms new custom AI avatar feature which should start showing up in an update this week. In the case of this earings call, Yuan's avatar was shown via Zoom Clips, the company’s asynchronous video creation tool, but it looks like the company is hoping to make it an even easier process for everyone to access. The goal here is for users to have the ability to create a sort of digital twin to use during Zoom calls or for presentations. But after watching the CEO's example, I'm not really sure they're quite there yet. It still hits slightly in the uncanny valley, and really seems to ushering in a dystopian feelingworkplace where no one is real. It also brings up questions of who owns these images and their mannerisms, along with what kind of power consumption is ultimately required.

    "title": "MSI shows off new weirdly flat PinSafe Design motherboards at Computex, possibly saving lives",
    "article_text": "\"In my day, motherboards felt like metal stubble\" \"Yes, ok grandma, back to bed\". When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. MSI's first AMD chipset MPOWER motherboard, the B850MPOWER, is also set to be a first in a new design for MSI boards. Instead of the usual prickly solder points on the back of a board, MSI has rolled out a new flat design. It's been dubbed the ‘PinSafe Design’ and is said to help “avoid injury caused by sharp pins during the assembly process.” In other words, MSI has got rid of a bunch of little pricks. Tom's Hardwarespotted the new castrated boards being shown off at this year's Computex alongside the otherunusual delights at the MSI boothThey describe the new boards as looking like an improvement on soldering techniques, creating a smoother surface instead of that prickly texture we're used to. It feels like an odd improvement to make, given I've never really heard anyone complain about spiky boards, but still an improvement none-the-less. While MSI claims this will help PC builders avoid injury, I'm kinda curious as to who they're talking about. I don't know if I've been exceptionally lucky with my time around PCBs but I don't think I've ever come close to cutting myself on one of these things. I do remember getting one stuck to my clothes thanks to all those soldered little grabbers, but never under my skin. Still, less risk is always good and it likely saves MSI on the soldering budget there as well. Assuming these aren't just filed down afterwards and it's actually a technique improvement, these pins likely use less solder up than the old spiky ones. It may seem like a tiny amount, but when you're manufacturing millions of boards it all adds up.MSI also claims these new PinSafe Design boards have greater system stability and ESD protection. Notably the manufacturer doesn't give any numbers or percentages to back this up, and I'm guessing those are pretty close to cactus. Tom's notes that the new design will probably help with foreign objects becoming stuck, and thinking back to my motherboarded jumper, they're probably right. I'd say you'll see more benefits in terms of a cleanly case than anything else touted here. The MPOWER boards are generally aimed at those who like to tinker, and I'd wager getting rid of the spikes will make getting into the case and moving things around easier than it once was. Even if only a little. The B850MPOWER looks like only the first to rock this design, so we should see plenty of other PinSafe boards come to market soon. On the one hand, I'm keen to see what all the fuss is about with these smooth-backed boards. On the other, I think I'm going to miss that prickly texture that just feels like I'm handling PC components. If you've ever cut yourself on a PCB, I suppose this is your lucky day to a new, safer PC building existence.

    "title": "Moza releases replica Essenza SCV12 wheel, giving us poors a chance at going hands on with a Lamborghini",
    "article_text": "The wheel debuted at the Dallas Dreamhack in a killer sounding sim. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Our favourite makers of affordable racing rig hardware are teaming up with one of the least affordable car manufacturers for a very slick looking wheel collab. TheMoza Racing x Automobili Lamborghini Squadra Corse SCV12sim racing wheel debuted at the Dallas DreamHack convention this week, treating attendees to a first look at this piece of kit. The wheel is the second collaboration betweenMozaand Automobili Lamborghini, and is based off the track-only hypercar. A bit like the last collab these two did which was based off the limited edition Lamborghini Essenza SCV12. The DreamHack setup paired the new wheel with the Moza R16 Direct Drive Wheelbase and mBooster active pedals, to get the most realistic experience out of the collaboration. We've been super impressed with Moza's budget racing solutions, but this configuration is definitely using some of the brand's pricer tech,like the R16 Wheelbase starting at $639 USD at the moment thanks to sales.The R16 Direct Drive Wheelbase, is the second fanciest the brand currently offers and is currently 20% off. It features 16 Nm of direct drive torque, as well as a 21-bit magnetic encoder. This is supported by a high-performance slanted pole servo motor and the body is said to be made of aviation-grade aluminum. All of this hardware is combined with what Moza calls the NexGen 4.0 force feedback algorithm, to deliver as realistic a sim experience as possible. ThemBooster active pedalsare also no slouch. It comes in two different configurations but I'm guessing they went all out with the set with the $999 USD CRP2 throttle for this experience. Regardless, these pedals are packing dual 200KG load cell sensors with a 21-bit high-resolution magnetic encoder. They sport a high-torque density motor to power it all, and the G-force feedback. Plus, you can make customisations with the Moza Pit House software to dial in your driving style. This makes for a much pricier setup than theMoza R5 Bundlethat impressed us with it's formidable nature despite budget price.That bundle is also 27%off at the moment, starting at $435. The Revuelto replica sim racing wheel is touted as a faithful recreation of the steering wheel out of Lamborghini's V12 machine. So even though we're not expecting it to be as cheap as some of the gear we've enjoyed from Moza, it's probably the most affordable way most of us will ever put our hands on the wheel of a Lambo. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. There's no word on the cost of the wheel as it's not quite available for sale, yet.

    "article_text": "The new Dyson Cool CF1 delivers everything I want from a fan When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The originalDysonCool was the world's first bladeless fan, and the catalyst for many of the brand's aircare explorations to come. Now, 16 years later, the brand has released multiple new products in this area, with increasingly advanced features, but the Dyson Cool hasn't seen an upgrade. Until now. The next-gen model – called the Dyson Cool CF1 – has the same powerful airflow and sleek, bladeless design, but adds some helpful features and usability tweaks to bring it in line with the rest of thebest fanson the market. It's not as big or splashy as some of the brand's other launches, but it delivers exactly what I want from a tabletop fan. So what's new? Firstly, you have more customization options to play with. The oscillation settings have been extended – you can now choose between 15, 40 and 70 degrees of oscillation (or no oscillation at all) – and you've now got 10 fan speeds to play with, too. Dyson has added a Night mode, which automatically dims the displays and adjusts fan speed, for cooling that'll help you drop off, rather than being distracting. It combines with a new sleep timer that shuts off the fan when you're (hopefully) happily away in the land of nod. There's also an LCD screen, which shows at a glance what mode you're in and which airflow setting you're using. Elsewhere, there's still an energy-efficient, brushless DC motor, and it uses Dyson's patented 'Air Multiplier' technology, which can apparently amplify the air around it by up to 13 times. As with all the Dyson fans, there are no blades, which means smooth and even airflow, and a design that's safer and far easier to keep clean. (You won't be able to use it to make yourself sound like a robot, though.) There are no air purification (or heating, or humidifying) functions, as appear on otherDyson fans in the wider range. The Dyson Cool FC1 is focused entirely on efficient personal cooling. \"The original bladeless fan revolutionized the way we think about airflow, combining cutting-edge engineering with sleek, safe, and efficient design,\" says Logan Thomson, Dyson Design Engineer. \"This latest iteration builds on those core benefits by introducing modern upgrades like intelligent features, including sleep mode, to meet the demands of today’s customers.” Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The Dyson Cool CF1 comes with a list price of £249.99. It goes on sale in the UK on 28 May 2025, at Dyson Demo stores or online atDyson.co.uk.

    "title": "Sam Altman's newest venture has built a robot to decide if you're human",
    "article_text": "The Orb Mini will scan your irises and evaluate your humanity When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Staring into a small metal orb and hearing it confirm your humanity is a scene from many a dystopian science fiction story. It's also an idea thatOpenAICEO Sam Altman thinks should be implemented in real life. That's the idea behind biometric identity startup Tools for Humanity's World system. World, formerly known as Worldcoin, is rolling out a portable iris scanner called the Orb Mini in the U.S. to carry out that directive in a way the company claims will benefit people. The Orb Mini looks like something between a futuristic smartphone camera and aBlack Mirrorprop. The device scans your iris to confirm your humanity, creating a unique “World ID,” a blockchain-stored identity token that says, “this person is real and has irises to prove it.” Sam Altman and company claim a lack of trust is one of the most urgent crises of the modern internet. Unspoken is Altman and OpenAI's contribution to a world where AI can generate books, deepfake voices, and even realistically awful dating profiles with ease. Tools for Humanity is betting that the next evolution of the internet will require biometric proof that you’re actually a person, not just a particularly well-programmed AI model. But it’s not just tech theatrics. Tools for Humanity has lined up some big-name partners to help bring the Orb Mini to everyone. Visa is working with World on a debit card connected to the World App, while Match Group is testing the technology in Japan to verify that the people you see on your dating app are both human and adult. Gaming hardware brandRazeris also exploring how to use World IDs to weed out bots from multiplayer sessions. After scanning your eye, Orb will provide you with a cryptographic identity to use for shopping, flirting, and gaming with other humans. The company plans to roll out 7,500 Orb Mini devices across the U.S. by the end of the year. You’ll find them at pop-ups, partner company locations, and anywhere else they can get a kiosk to scan your face. The Orb Mini is designed to be portable, so it could go anywhere people with eyes go. Of course, a company collecting and storing biometric data from millions of people sounds problematic. That's because it is unless there are a lot of foolproof security systems for storing and accessing the data. Tools for Humanity says it has all that covered with anonymized data, as well as not storing iris images and other privacy-centered features. Still asking people to trust you with their eyeballs may be a big swing. But, as AI-generated content floods social media and scams get more sophisticated, the appeal of ensuring you're interacting with actual humans is understandable. A verified human internet is a nice idea, but there are a lot of questions about what it means to have to prove you’re real in a world where realism is becoming suspiciously easy to fake. Trusting that someone is human is tough online; trusting a company to always keep your identity safe is even tougher. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

    "title": "Here's the thing Apple gets right about platforms that Samsung would be smart to copy",
    "article_text": "The power of one When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I spend most of my time using an excellentiPhone 16 Pro Max, which means I get to live most of my existence using the expertly tailorediOS 18experience. Sometimes, though, I use the equally fantasticSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, a flagship phone now runningAndroid 15andOneUI 7. In many ways, the S25 Ultra is equal to the iPhone; the platforms tend to look and work in more or less similar ways. There is, though, one significant way in which they differ and, to be honest, I'm tired of it. As you may be aware, unless you own aGoogle Pixel Phone, you're unlikely to get a pure Android experience. Third-party partners, such as OnePlus, Motorola, andSamsung, customize their skins for the platform. For some, that's the beauty of Android: it can be many things to many people, and in the case of Samsung, this expresses itself in the form of OneUI. It's a lovely platform that now offers things such as deeply integratedSamsung Galaxy AI, Samsung Health, and the lively Now Brief Widget, which offers information and chatty aphorisms like, \"The day rolls on.\" Where the experience is less grand, though, is in duplication. For every app where Google and Android ostensibly have you covered, think, Photos, Contacts, and Chrome; Samsung's OneUI has a duplicate. Some, like Internet and Contacts, are easy to ignore. Others, like \"Gallery,\" are less so because they include core features like Generative AI image editing. Some, likeSketch to Image, which allows you to scribble on a photo to add elements like a photo-realistic bird flying or a dog sitting next to you, are fun if not full of utility. But Gallery pales in comparison toGoogle Photos' powerful search capabilities. When I need to find an image, I will always go there. There's also Google's criticalPlay Store, but it doesn't have all the Samsung Apps you need – that would be the \"Galaxy Store.\" I've learned to live with most of this duplication, but the other day I stumbled into a bit of doppleganger mess that tested my patience. In the hours before an industry event, I received an email on my iPhone with a link to add the invite to my digital wallet. I clicked on the link, thinking it would openAppleWallets, but I was thrust into a Google login. It was then that I realized the link was for Google Wallet. Everyone's Wallet app icon looks alike because there's really only one visual metaphor for a wallet: a stacked group of credit cards. I picked up the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, opened the email, and selected the Google Wallet icon. That's when I discovered, to my surprise, that Google Wallet is not pre-installed. I installed it and then signed in to my Google account. I then used the global Google search on my S25 ultra to find the Wallet app, and I got three results: Note how Samsung's Wallet appears first; that's no accident. Someone not paying attention might open that link first and then search in vain for the invite or plane ticket they just added. On an iPhone, this would never happen. You get one utility app, though, you can certainly add more if you choose. But that should be the default: Core platform apps only, and not ones that align only with your specific brand. I get that Samsung wants to build an ecosystem, but as a member of the Android family, it should accept that it will never own that ecosystem. There will always be this duplication problem, unless Samsung stops trying to copy these apps and lets Google and Android take the wheel. After all, are we buying Samsung Galaxy phones for OneUI apps or, ultimately, for that hardware experience, including things like the cameras and a lovely, nearly bezel-free screen? I know that Samsung is quite proud of its flavor of AI, but to be honest, I don't think it can keep up with the OpenAIs and Googles of the world. As it stands, the best bits of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra AI experiencearefrom Google (Gemini). For some, my perspective is the opposite of what they want. They love choice, and the fact that all Android Phones are subtly or frustratingly different somehow pleases them. That the Photos, Internet, or Wallet apps are different on every platform is, they think, an exciting plus. Sure, you keep thinking that. I, on the other hand, will dream of the OneUI update that is paper-thin and combines all the fundamental and best bits of Android while only adding features Google wouldn't do otherwise. It is ironic that Samsung calls its platform \"OneUI\" when in fact the experience is the combination of two UIs living under one flagship roof. It's still too crowded a space, and I would like Samsung to kick a few duplicate tenants out. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

A benchmark spotted on the web by tipster@yabhishekhd(viaGSMArena), matching the model number of Project Moohan, has revealed details that point towards the very capable Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 being the processor inside. We already knew the device would run a chipset made by Qualcomm, but now we have a big clue about the specific model. The Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 was announced early in 2024, and haspreviously been linkedto the Google and Samsung headset.

    "title": "Aluminum and the iPhone 17 Air sounds like a poor recipe for clumsy people like me",
    "article_text": "It could be toodle-oo to titanium When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. At first, I wasn’t sold on the idea of titanium being used in phone chassis, dismissing it as a bit of a marketing gimmick rather than a truly useful feature. But then I spent time with theiPhone 15 Pro Max,Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra,and then their successors, theiPhone 16 Pro MaxandGalaxy S25 Ultra, made me a titanium convert My 180-degree turn in opinion about titaniumstems from my habit of not using cases for flagship phones, as part of my appreciation for slick industrial design. This doesn't mix with an inherent clumsiness and bad luck that often sees these expensive phones take a plunge towards hard floors and surfaces in one way or another. Those with a stainless steel chassis would tend to chip, dent, and scratch, but the aforementioned titanium-sporting phones benefit hugely from the toughness of the metal and basically shrug off the accidental battering I give them. So it’s my hope that more phones, including the likely upcomingSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7make use of titanium. However, despite its toughness and relative lightness, the rumorediPhone 17 Airwill eschew titanium for an aluminium frame, all with the idea of maximising thinness and lightness. We’ve heard this rumor a few times, with the latest tip coming from the Korean-languageyeux112‘s blog. The blog, which supposedly has insider or supply chain information, claims aluminum will be used for the frame of the iPhone 17 Air, as toughness takes a back seat in favour of lightness. Having recently been at a wedding, I’m all for thinner and lighter phones that can help me avoid unwanted bulges in my suit (stop laughing at the back). But I don’t want this to come at the expense of toughness, so the idea of aluminum in the iPhone 17 Air has me raising a wary eyebrow. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. I also rather like the heft of iPhones; there’s just something reassuringly solid and premium with theolder Pro models and their stainless steel chassis. I’ve since embraced titanium for the larger Max phones as the lighter weight makes the larger phones easier to handle one-handed. But much lighter would run the risk of making these flagshipApplephones feel potentially cheaper than their list prices. That being said, Apple can still be innovative from time to time, and I’d not be surprised if the Cupertino crew is working on some form of alloy or design that’ll thread the line between a super-light and thin phone and one that’ll not be ruined by the odd fall. We’ve seen Apple do that with its Ceramic Shield glass, so perhaps we could see the advent of ‘Aluminium Armor’ with the iPhone 17 Air; time will tell, and it'll likely be at a SeptemberApple event.

    "title": "Cisco security flaw exploited to build botnet of thousands of devices",
    "article_text": "It's the second botnet built using the same flaw When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A high-severity vulnerability plaguing old Ciscoroutersis being used to build a malicious, global botnet, experts have warned. Cybersecurity researchers Sekoia published an in-depth report on the threat actor - dubbed ViciousTrap - which is using a vulnerability tracked as CVE-2023-20118, to target Cisco Small Business RV016, RV042, RV042G, RV082, RV320, and RV325 Routers. This flaw, found in the web-based management interface, allows an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device, made possible due to improper validation of user input within incoming HTTP packets. Unfortunately, Cisco won’t be patching the bug since the affected devices are past their end-of-life date,WNE Securityreported. The vulnerability allowed ViciousTrap to execute ashell scriptnamed NetGhost, “which redirects incoming traffic from specific ports of the compromised router to a honeypot-like infrastructure under the attacker's control allowing them to intercept network flows,” Sekoia explained. So far, almost 5,300 devices, found in 84 countries around the world, were assimilated into the botnet. The majority of the victims are located in - Macau (850). This is not the first time Sekoia is ringing the alarm on CVE-2023-20118. In late February 2025,TechRadar ProreportedSekoia was warning about a botnet named PolarEdge, using the same vulnerability to target a range of devices from Cisco, ASUS, QNAP, and Synology. At the time, roughly 2,000 devices were said to have been affected. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! For ViciousTrap’s work, all exploitation attempts came from a single IP address, the researchers further discovered, stating that the attacks started in March 2025. It was also said the threat actors repurposed an undocumented web shell previously used in PolarEdge attacks. Although these things are always difficult to confirm, Sekoia believes the attackers are Chinese in origin.

    "title": "TCL says its new flagship mini-LED TV is its brightest one yet, but there’s another feature I’m more excited about",
    "article_text": "TCL's new flagship TV goes ultra-wide When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Today,TCLannounced pricing and availability for its new QM8K series mini-LED TVs. The latest models replace last year’s flagshipTCL QM851G, one of thebest TVsTechRadar tested in 2024, and provide “up to 35% more dimming zones and up to 65% higher peak brightness” than the mid-rangeTCL QM7Kseries, according to the company. The new TVs will be sold in 65- to 98-inch screen sizes, with the 65- and 85-inch models available now, and the 75- and 98-inch models arriving next month. Pricing for the QM8K series is as follows: A key feature of the QM8K series is TCL’s new CrystGlow WHVA Panel with ZeroBorder. This new panel design boasts an anti-reflective coating to reduce screen glare along with an ultra-wide viewing angle that TCL claims “virtually eliminates color shift, with a 40% wider color viewing angle” than last year’s QM851G series. ZeroBorder refers to the vanishingly narrow 3-4mm width between the TV’s edge and the display in the QM8K series, a design feature that TCL achieved using a one-piece aerospace-grade aluminum alloy mold and anodized ceramic film to stabilize the display panel. Another QM8K feature is TCL’s Halo Control System. This uses a new “Super High Energy” LED chip, along with a “Super Condensed” micro lens, 23-bit backlight controller, and a Dynamic Light Algorithm to enhance color accuracy and reduce mini-LED backlight “halo” artifacts. Helping in this regard is the increased number of backlight local dimming zones in the QM8K series, with up to 3,500 in the 98-inch model. TCL QM8K series TVs have a 144Hz native refresh rate and FreeSync Premium Pro for gaming. They support both Dolby Vision and HDR10+high dynamic rangeformats and feature Audio by Bang & Olufsen, with upfiring drivers in the TV to deliver Dolby Atmos and DTS Virtual:X sound. Google TV is used in the QM8K series as a smart TV platform, and it features an enhanced GUI, hands-free voice control, and an Art Mode with AI Art. QM8K series TVs also feature a built-inATSC 3.0 tunerfor NextGen TV broadcasts. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. One of the biggest weaknesses of mini-LED and regular LED TVs is off-axis uniformity. This essentially means that both picture contrast and colors shift when viewing the TV from off-center seats, so that a viewer seated anywhere other than directly in front of the screen will experience reduced picture quality. When I reviewed the TCL QM851G, I found its picture quality to be fantastic overall, with one main exception: off-axis uniformity. To quote from the review, the QM851G’s “colors and contrast were both diminished when viewing from far off-center seats.” This was the key reason I gave it a 4.5 instead of a 5-star rating for picture quality, and it was the one point that held it back from getting a full endorsement as a recommended TV for sports viewing. Thebest OLED TVsdon’t suffer from the same off-axis uniformity issue, and some of thebest mini-LED TVsalso implement features to expand the viewing angle. TCL’s specs for the QM8K indicate that it will have a 40% wider viewing angle, so I’m hopeful this new model will provide a vast improvement when it comes to off-center viewing. TechRadar will soon be reviewing the TCL QM8K, so we’ll have more to say about the matter very shortly.

    "article_text": "Microsoft prepares to secure the quantum future When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Quantum computers currently only exist within specialized laboratories - but it’s generally understood this will not be the case for long, and the technology could soon be introduced into a number of different industries like finance, cybersecurity, and even medicine. The evolution in quantum computing presents new challenges for cybersecurity teams, with the tech theorized to have the potential to break encryption and “disrupt contemporary cryptographic algorithms,”Microsoft has warned. To tackle this,Microsoftis introducing a “significant milestone” in the post-quantum cryptography (PQC) journey by making PQC capabilities available for Windows Insiders, Canary Channel Build 27852 and higher, and Linux, SymCrypt-OpenSSL version 1.9.0. Save up to 68% on identity theft protection for TechRadar readers! TechRadar editors praise Aura's upfront pricing and simplicity. Aura also includes a password manager, VPN, and antivirus to make its security solution an even more compelling deal. Preferred partner (What does this mean?) This means that customers will be able to begin experimenting with PQC “within their operational environments”. For Windows, Microsoft is bringing ML-KEM and ML-DSA for Windows Insiders through updates to the Cryptography API: Next Generation (CNG) libraries as well as the Certificate and Cryptographic messaging functions. This aims to help developers prepare for “harvest now, decrypt later” attacks. The changes correspond withNIST standardised algorithms, but will be continuously developed and updated to meet new requirements. New changes have also been introduced to Linux, with updates for programmers to use OpenSSL’s API surface powered by SymCrypt cryptographic operations. Version 1.9.0 will enable developers to play around with TLS hybrid key exchange to prepare for future threats. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! “PQC algorithms are relatively new, and it is prudent not to consider the initial generation of PQC algorithms as the definitive solution but rather view this as an evolving field,” Microsoft explains. “This underscores the importance of \"Crypto Agility\" which involves designing solutions to be more resilient to the use of different algorithms and/or upgradable to use future algorithms as the PQ standards evolve.” Researchers believe thatquantum computing could be the ‘biggest security threat of all time’and able to break even the toughest existing encryptions - so updates to security will be much needed for software firms as the tech develops.

    "article_text": "It's the classic WhatsApp experience, but bigger When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Meta is known for offering many apps, but not many of them support the iPad. That is changing now, though, at least for one that makes messaging and voice calls across the globe a breeze. That’s right –WhatsAppis now full-sized on the iPad as the most recent build that hitApple’s App Store brings support for Apple's tablet. It’s been a long time coming, andWhatsAppis even beating Instagram to the punch. While the release notes for the latest build, 25.16.81, don’t mention anything special, this fresh piece of code does enable support for the iPad. Once you’ve updated, it’ll stretch and fill the screen appropriately on an entry-level iPad, theiPad mini, or both sizes of theiPad ProoriPad Air. You'll be able to respond to messages, share your iPadOS screen on a call, and video chat with up to 32 other folks. WhatsApp even releaseda blog postdetailing the anticipated arrival. It’s still the classic messaging experience that WhatsApp has offered, but there is one key change from the iPhone version. WhatsApp now features a two-column layout, allowing you to view contacts' names and group chats on the left and the messages for the selected chat on the right. So, it's quite similar to how Apple’s own Messages app utilizes the larger screen real estate. Perhaps even better news for iPad fans, the team at Meta has baked in support for multitasking on the iPad. This way, you can split the screen to have WhatsApp on one side or have it be the floating third app. That should make it easier to respond to messages and keep an eye on larger group chats. The app also works with the Magic Keyboard and the Apple Pencil, allowing you to use the latter to scribble a message and send it within WhatsApp. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Now, a WhatsApp app for iPad has been rumored for quite some time, but the anticipation built up earlier this week when theapp responded to a post on X (formerly Twitter)with a set of looking eyes. Less than a day later, the app is here, and it has us wondering what Meta might drop on the iPad next. Arguably, Instagram is another app within Meta's wheelhouse that iPad users want support for, so WhatsApp gaining support hopefully shows that it's also in the works. The WhatsApp team also promises that this is just the start of its journey on iPad, and is looking forward to feedback from users. Jacob Krol is the US Managing Editor, News for TechRadar.

    "article_text": "ProtectEU keeps raising concerns among the tech industry When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The EU plan to create a legal backdoor into encrypted communications keeps raising concerns. This time, 89 signatories coming from the tech industry – including civil society organizations, some of thebest VPNand email providers, and cybersecurity experts – are warning against the privacy and security dangers of the Technology Roadmap on encryption included in theProtectEUstrategy. In ajoint letterpublished on Monday, May 26, 2025, experts are now urging the European Commission to \"reframe its approach\" and protect strong encryption practices. \"While we recognize the importance of elevating security efforts during moments of increased geopolitical instability, we are concerned by the framing of the technology roadmap,\" experts wrote. Encryption, the scrambling of data into an unreadable form to prevent unwanted access, is the backbone of how services like Signal, WhatsApp, andProton Mailwork. Yet, law enforcement has long argued that this technology is an obstacle to criminal investigations. As cyberattack incidents keep rising worldwide, though, even government bodies, like the FBI and CISA in the US, have started to encourage citizens toswicth to end-to-end encrypted servicesto fight back these threats. The European Commission itselfpreviously acknowledgedencryption as needed to protect the integrity of cyberspace, too. This is why, for the signatories, who include the likes of Proton,Surfshark,Tuta Mail, Mozilla, and Element, alongside leading cryptographers and digital rights groups, this technology remains a \"key cybersecurity tool\" that cannot be compromised. \"Undermining encryption weakens the very foundation of secure communications and systems, leaving individuals, businesses, and public institutions more vulnerable to attacks,\" they wrote. 🔒 𝐄𝐧𝐜𝐫𝐲𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐈𝐬 𝐍𝐨𝐧-𝐍𝐞𝐠𝐨𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞 🔒Together with ~90 orgs & individuals, we've sent an open letter to the EU Commission to uphold strong encryption.No government can change the laws of math.Read the open letter ⤵️https://t.co/pdyoSEjoCH pic.twitter.com/CdP1WYjpyZMay 26, 2025 TechRadar needs you!We want to know what you think about the world of VPNs.

To take part, click the link below:https://futurenet.questionpro.eu/tr-vpn ProtectEU comes as the first step in theEU Commission's planto bolster the security of the European bloc in the years to come. While we don't know much at the time of writing, we do know the strategy includes finding a technical way to createencryption backdoorsinto software. That's exactly what most worries the tech benches. They wrote: \"We are deeply concerned by the Commission’s continued focus on identifying ways to weaken or circumvent encryption. This undermines its own security objectives under the ProtectEU strategy.\" The European Commission has already tried to weaken encryption with its proposal to scan all citizens' communications to halt the spread of child sexual material, in fact. Deemed by critics asChat Control, the bill has been failing to attract the needed majority since 2022. Along the way, the European Court of Human Rights even ruled \"illegal break encryption,\" a hard blow for the supporters of client-side scanning technologies to monitor encrypted communications. While messaging apps and email providers are set to be the main target of lawmakers, an EU expert group explicitly recently referred toVPN services as \"key challenges\"to the investigative work of law enforcement agencies for the very first time, alongside encrypted devices, apps, and new communications operators. Now, experts believe that what lawmakers aim to do under the ProtectEU strategy will lead to the same security, human rights, and accountability issues. They then urge to reframe the Technology Roadmap on Encryption by taking into consideration also the industry concerns, not only those of law enforcement. \"Any future roadmap that aspires to be credible and balanced must consider the feasibility of any potential technological capabilities and their societal, technical, and legal impact,\" they conclude. This is the second time digital rights and tech experts have gotten together to call on the European Commissionnot to undermine encryptionwith the new ProtectEU plan since April 1, 2025, the day the plan was first unveiled. Also on that occasion, experts urged lawmakers to make them an active part of the process.

    "title": "Nikon says its cameras are about to get pricier thanks to a 'necessary price adjustment' – here's when it starts",
    "article_text": "Photography is about to get (even more) expensive, it seems When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Nikon is officially joining the list of camera manufacturers who are raising camera prices in response to, you guessed it, the US tariffs. In a short post on theNikon US press site, the camera giant said that \"due to the recent tariffs\" it was planning a \"necessary price adjustment for products\". This will apparently take effect from June 23, making it a potentially good time to pick up that Nikon camera you've been eyeing. We don't yet know which cameras (or lenses) will be affected, but that should become clear in the next few weeks. Nikon offered a small crumb of comfort by stating that it will be \"carefully monitoring any tariff developments and may adjust pricing as necessary to reflect the evolving market conditions\". That could mean an adjustment in the wrong direction if the trade wars continue to heat up, but hopefully the price changes won't be as damaging as the ones we've already seen from other manufacturers. TheDJI Osmo Pocket 3, for example, has jumped from its $500 launch priceto $800, and has remained at that level despite a 90-day truce on China's tariffs that have temporarily reduced the rate on US imports down to 10%. Nikon is far from alone in announcing tariff-related price hikes, though not all of them have come into effect just yet. Canongave us asimilar warning earlier this monthby stating in its quarterly earnings call that it had \"notified major dealers that we will raise prices and are in the process of estimating the timing and amount of the increase\". Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. This means we're in a strange waiting period where camera fans are bracing themselves for price rises, without knowing exactly which models will be hit and how they might affect existing stock that's in the US already (in theory, the latter shouldn't be hit by tariff-related price rises on imports). As spotted bySony Alpha Rumors,Sonyhas seemingly already raised prices on its China-made cameras and lenses, which include theSony RX100 VIIand a number of lenses including theFE 70-200mm F4 Macro G OSS II(which has seen an 18% price jump). But we don't yet know if these prices are a temporary reaction to the current tariffs or a more permanent hike. Fujifilm, meanwhile, was recently forced to pause pre-orders on cameras including the X100VI, GFX100RF and X-M5 (black version), while the newFujifilm X halfhas a high price in the US compared to other regions ($849, compared to £699 / AU$1,349 in the UK and Australia). It's clearly a tumultuous time for cameras and lenses – and while panic-buying is never a wise option, if could be worth pulling the trigger soon if you're in the US and have been considering buying new from Nikon or Canon.

    "title": "Apple’s AI smart home hub could launch this year, here are 4 things to expect",
    "article_text": "The Apple smart home takes shape When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If you’ve been following recentApplenews, you might have heard the rumor that the company is working on a home hub that would look something like a cross between aHomePodand aniPad. Given Apple’s pedigree, it has the potential to become one of thebest smart home devicesaround, and it now looks like the device could launch as soon as the end of 2025. That’s according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, who claimed in hisPower On newsletterthat we could get our hands on this product “by the end of this year at the earliest” (although that’s not yet set in stone). It could mark Apple’s attempt to both dominate the smart home and make further inroads into artificial intelligence (AI) – something it hopes itsApple Intelligenceplatform will be a key part of. Interested in this device? We’ve heard a few things about it already, and it's certainly shaping up to be an eye-catching addition to Apple’s product roster. That’s due in part to the fact that Apple is allegedly working on an entirely newoperating systemfor the product, potentially namedhomeOS, that is based on tvOS and will prominently feature Siri and Apple Intelligence. Secondly, the key focal point of the so-called HomePad will be its display. Here, rumors have pointed to a 7-inch screen with a thick bezel, with a front-facing camera mounted on the top edge. The latter will reflect an emphasis on using the device forvideo calling. The third point is that Apple apps will, of course, be supported. And finally, you can expect some features from other apps, such as the iPhone’sStandBy dashboard. The focus, though, will remain on controlling your connected smart home devices. Apple has never really embraced the smart home to the extent that some rivals have. Sure, you can control connected products usingHomeKitand the Home app, butthese have their problems. Beyond that, there’s also a surprising lack of Apple-branded hardware in this space. That could all change in the next year or two. But the smart home isn’t Apple’s real target here – it’s artificial intelligence. AI is a huge, booming market right now, and Apple has already fallen behind due to itswell-documented struggleswith its Apple Intelligence platform, with a host of promised features delayed and missing altogether. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Like many tech firms, Apple wants to get its AI into as many customers’ homes as possible, so launching a smart home hub makes a lot of sense in this regard: it gives Apple another way to appeal to customers who might not be convinced by Apple Intelligence so far. This isn’t the only smart home product that rumors claim Apple is working on, though. The company also has something up its sleeve that would comprisea screen on the end of a robotic arm, allowing it to be moved around at will.

    "title": "The new Harry, Hermione and Ron have finally apparated for HBO's Harry Potter TV series",
    "article_text": "No, you won't have heard of them, but here they are When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. HBO' forthcomingHarry PotterTV show(it'll also be streaming onHBO Max), has finally found the crucial part of its cast,having already signed up a combination of Hollywood and British names for its adults cast. Harry, Hermione, and Ron have all been cast – and as you'd expect for young kids, they're pretty unknown names. Dominic McLaughlin will play Harry Potter, and is somehow already a veteran of the 'kid attends mysterious school for those with special skills' genre, having played a part in the BBC TV seriesGifted, which was about kids with superpowers. Arabella Stanton plays Hermione Granger, and also isn't new to acting, having played Matilda in the wonderfulMatilda the Musicalin London's West End. She followed that up with a role inStarlight Expresson stage. Lastly, Alastair Stout will portray Ron Weasley, and is notable among the three for having the name most like a character in the Harry Potter books. He seems to have the least acting experience of the three, but has appeared in a potato commercial, which also somehow feels very appropriate for a character like Ron. HBO's TV adaptation isscheduled to begin filming sometime in mid-2025, so they'll have to get stuck into their textbooks ASAP to be ready to go. It's expected that the early books will take up a season each, too, so it'll be interesting to see if HBO pumps out a new season annually to ensure that this intrepid trio don't age out of the teenage roles they'll soon grow into. By the time we get the fourth book/season, we might find that things need to be split across two parts. We'll see, but thebest streaming servicesloveto split seasons, so you have to assume it'll be the case here. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The kids will join John Lithgow as Hogwarts' headteacher Albus Dumbledore, Paapa Essiedu as Severus Snape, Nick Frost as Rubeus Hagrid, Janet McTeer as Minerva McGonagall, Paul Whitehouse as Argus Filch, and Luke Thallon as Quirinus Quirell. There's a huge swathe of roles not cast yet, of course (at least, not officially), ranging from the likes of the Weasley siblings through to Neville Longbottom – but, perhaps the biggest missing role is Draco Malfoy. We don't know exactly when the show will air yet, but it's planned to arrive in 2026. Time will tell if it winds up making it onto ourbest Max showslist.

    "title": "OnePlus' new Plus Key gives users a hardware link to AI, replacing the fan-favorite Alert Slider",
    "article_text": "It’s not often we see a new hardware button When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. OnePlus has announced OnePlus AI, and while the Chinese company’s vision for mobile artificial intelligence comes mainly via new software, the list of changes includes an update to one of the brand’s most iconic hardware features. The new Plus Key is a physical button that replaces the three-stage Alert Slider. The button can be customized in settings to activate one of several features, like opening the camera or starting a live translation. The new hardware feature will make its debut with the OnePlus 13s, a China-only model previously known as theOnePlus 13 Miniin online rumor circles. OnePlus has confirmed the Plus Key will come to all OnePlus smartphones rolling out this year – at a minimum we’d expect this to include the rumored OnePlus 14 and OnePlus 14R, which based on prior releases we'd expect to launch in China at the end of 2025 for global launch in 2026. Though note that OnePlus might skip the number 14 and call this the OnePlus 15 series instead. By default, the Plus Key activates the newAI Plus Mind capture system, which saves a screenshot, plus an AI summary of the on-screen information, in the new AI Plus Mind app. It’s this, alongside the timing of this hardware announcement, that illustrates OnePlus’ vision of the Plus Key as a part of the company’s AI strategy. At the official OnePlus AI reveal event, I spoke with Arthur Lam, director of OxygenOS and AI strategy at OnePlus, about how the Plus Key and AI Plus Mind work together. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. “The thought process behind it was we wanted to bring AI that can empower you to do different things. And I think one of the biggest things was we live in this digital age where we have a lot of fragmented memories across multiple places” said Lam. “We believe that this is not a software-only solution,” Lam continued, “it's a hardware-software solution; that makes it uniquely OnePlus.” When OnePlus announced the end of the Alert Slider,I wrote that I’d always found it to be a useful and charismatic addition to the brand’s handsets. However, even with the Alert Slider’s fan-favorite status, Lam tells me the company is confident that it’s time for an update. “People ask us, ‘after using the Alert Slider for a decade, why are you changing it?’ Because now is the time, because it's connected with your AI Plus Mind.” “It makes sense for us to make changes. Even though we've been there for the last decade, and many of the users love it, we think it's time for us to evolve it to the next generation.” There’s more to OnePlus AI than just the Plus Key and AI Plus Mind – upcoming features include AI Translation, an AI Reframe tool for cropping photos, and AI VoiceScribe, which automatically transcribes phone calls. With that said, the Plus Key is the most fully-fledged AI hardware feature we’ve seen on a smartphone so far – this AI-first approach could help OnePlus to differentiate the Plus Key from the iPhone's Action Button, which clearly served as inspiration. It's also telling that OnePlus is willing to cut a well-loved feature like the Alert Slider for the AI-focused Plus Key. This suggests that OnePlus AI could be a major priority for the brand going forwards. Personally, I'm a fan of the Alert Slider, but I think AI Plus Mind is a great idea, and a good enough feature to make the Plus Key seem novel and genuinely useful.

    "article_text": "A popular crypto wallet is being spoofed When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Cybercriminals are targeting cryptocurrency owners withAppleMac devices using a highly sophisticated piece of malware which hides in plain sight and aims to steal their seed phrases. A ‘seed phrase’ is a 12 or 24-word combination that allows anyone to load an existing wallet into a new device and gain access to all of the funds inside. In a new report, security researchers Moonlock said there are currently four active campaigns distributing a fake Ledger Live app spoofing an official offering which allows users to send, manage, and track their crypto portfolio. The campaign has allegedly been active since August 2024, and although the report doesn’t discuss how the victims end up downloading the fake Ledger Live app, it does detail how it works: It replaces the existing, legitimate app, and then during the login process displays a fake error message. The “critical error” can only be remedied by submitting the 24-word seed phrase which then immediately gets relayed to the attackers. “This isn’t just a theft. It’s a high-stakes effort to outsmart one of the most trusted tools in the crypto world,” Moonlock explains. “And the thieves are not backing down.” “Users should take the news as a clear signal to stay alert,” the researchers concluded, urging users to be wary of phishing emails, to never share their seed phrases with anyone, and to only download cryptocurrency wallet apps from legitimate sources.

    "title": "EU state calls for Schengen ban on Russians",
    "article_text": "Latvian Foreign Minister Baiba Braze has called on EU member states to stop issuing Schengen tourist visas to Russian citizens, claiming they pose a threat to the bloc’s internal security. Since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022, the EU has fully suspended its visa facilitation agreement with Russia and imposed travel restrictions. Latvia, along with Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, Finland, and the Czech Republic, has banned tourist visas for Russian citizens. Norway, which shares a land border with Russia and is not an EU member state, has also closed its border for Russian tourists and other ‘non-essential’ visitors. “Latvia calls on the EU countries to halt visa issuance for Russian citizens,”Braze posted on X on Sunday, citing security concerns. She noted that the number of Schengen visas issued to Russian passport holders surged by 25% last year compared to 2023. According to the Schengen Barometer tracker, the figure surpassed 500,000 in total, despite sanctions targeting Russian applicants. Italy led in visa applications received and emerged as the primary destination for Russian tourists within the Schengen Area, data showed. Braze’s calls echo those by the country’s interior minister, Rihards Kozlovskis, who said in March it was the EU’s“moral duty”to impose an outright visa ban on Russian tourists. Kozlovskis claimed the EU“must admit”that it is“in a hybrid war”with Russia and urged the bloc to“seriously recognize the threat”that Russian tourists allegedly pose to the EU’s internal security. Riga has adopted an increasingly hardline stance against Moscow since the Ukraine conflict escalated, announcing sweeping travel restrictions for Russian nationals, including barring Russian-registered vehicles from entering the country. Along with neighboring Estonia and Lithuania, Latvia has also exhibited hostility to its ethnic Russian minority, which currently comprises around 25% of the country’s population. In addition to spending more than 1% of its entire GDP on weapons for Ukraine, Latvia has begun to deport thousands of Russians who refused to take or failed a mandatory Latvian language test. It has also destroyed Soviet-era World War II monuments, as well as arrested dozens of people for celebrating the Soviet Union’s victory over Nazi Germany. Earlier this month, Latvia’s military intelligence service issued public guidelines on how to identify potential Russian spies and saboteurs. Traits such as“sloppy appearance”and“insufficient hygiene”were listed as possible signs of a reconnaissance-sabotage group member.",

    "title": "Putin ‘playing with fire’ – Trump",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has suggested that his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin is“playing with fire,”without elaborating on what exactly he means. In recent days, Trump has increasingly criticized the Kremlin over what he perceives as a lack of progress in peace negotiations between Moscow and Kiev. Last week, Trump and Putin held a telephone conversation during which they discussed the prospects of a peaceful resolution to the Ukraine conflict. Both leaders characterized the call as productive. In a post on his Truth Social platform on Tuesday, Trump claimed that“if it weren’t for me, lots of really bad things would have already happened to Russia, and I mean REALLY BAD.” The US president added that Putin is“playing with fire!” Later in the day, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce emphasized that Trump’s remark was not a sign of the US president’s“frustration,”but that he is just being“transparent about his opinion.” “I think this is what Russia should take seriously; Americans certainly do,”she added. Bruce further emphasized that Washington continues to favor“direct talks between Russia and Ukraine.” Meanwhile, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, in response to Trump's latest remark, said on X that he only knows“of one REALLY BAD thing — WWIII.” “I hope Trump understands this!”the official, who currently serves as deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, added.In a post on Sunday, Trump also criticized Moscow’s actions in Ukraine, claiming that the Russian president had“gone absolutely CRAZY”and alleging that he had targeted the neighboring country with recent strikes“for no reason whatsoever.” However, Trump also stated that Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky“is doing his Country no favors by talking the way he does.” Moscow has stressed that it was carrying out strikes on Ukrainian military-linked installations in response to Kiev’s attempts to launch drone raids on civilian facilities in Russia. Over the past week alone, Russian air defenses have downed 1,465 Ukrainian drones over areas outside the active conflict zone, the Defense Ministry in Moscow said on Tuesday. According to the military,“the Kiev regime, supported by certain European countries, has taken a number of provocative steps aimed at disrupting the negotiation process.”There has been a considerable increase in Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory, involving drones as well as Western-made missiles since the start of May, it added. Russian forces retaliated with high-precision missile and drone strikes aimed“exclusively at Ukraine’s military and defense industrial facilities,”the ministry said. On Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov chalked Trump’s harsh rhetoric up to“emotional overload”experienced by the US president in light of the very complicated peace talks between Russia and Ukraine that have gotten underway.",

    "title": "EU state sues Belarus for €200mn",
    "article_text": "Lithuania is seeking over €200 million ($227 million) in damages from Belarus over a migrant crisis that Vilnius says was deliberately orchestrated by Minsk, local news agency BNS has reported. The crisis began in 2021, when Belarus emerged as a major transit route for migrants from the Middle East attempting to reach the EU. While Poland was most heavily affected, the flow also impacted Latvia and Lithuania. Minsk has denied any involvement in facilitating illegal crossings and has accused EU states of mistreating asylum seekers. According to the outlet’s report on Monday, citing Lithuania’s Ministry of Justice, the claim stems from a case filed last week with the International Court of Justice (ICJ), in which Lithuania accused Belarus of having breached international obligations by failing to secure the shared border. “The Republic of Lithuania’s complaint states that the country will seek reparations, and (…) the preliminary estimated damage exceeds €200 million,”the ministry told BNS, noting that the figure reflects spending by domestic authorities between 2021 and 2023 and may be revised. Expenses cited in the complaint include the construction of physical barriers, upgrades to surveillance systems, and the deployment of an“unprecedented”number of personnel to the border. In 2021, Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland declared states of emergency and announced plans to build barriers. Warsaw is now reportedly considering joining Lithuania’s case. Lithuania’s border guards have blocked 23,600 illegal entry attempts since the start of the crisis, according to BNS. A 2022 Amnesty International reportaccusedLithuania of employing racially biased and unlawful tactics against migrants from Africa and the Middle East. Brussels turned a blind eye to the violations, the report said. Tensions between Belarus and the EU escalated after the country’s 2020 presidential election and subsequent mass protests over what the opposition claimed was widespread fraud. Minsk rejected the allegations, insisting that the unrest was instigated by the US and its European“satellites,”as well as neighboring Ukraine. The EU has accused Belarus of engineering the migrant influx by arranging flights from countries such as Iraq and Syria and channeling migrants to the border in retaliation for Western sanctions. Minsk has accused the bloc of waging a“hybrid war”by supporting exiled opposition figures and banned media outlets.",

    "title": "EU sanctions against Russia don’t work – Bild",
    "article_text": "The EU’s sanctions against Russia are not working, German tabloid Bild has reported, citing substantial energy export revenues that Moscow has continued to rake in despite Western attempts to curb them. The Russian economy has continued to grow despite sweeping economic restrictions on Moscow imposed following the escalation of the the Ukraine conflict in 2022, including bans on seaborne oil shipments, financial and aviation-related restrictions, as well as the freezing of about $300 billion in Russian reserves. In an analysis piece on Tuesday, Bild described the latest, 17th package of EU sanctions against Moscow as“just a drop in the ocean,”when compared with the projected €233 billion ($253 billion) that Russia is expected to gross from energy and raw material exports this year. According to the publication, the EU is the fourth largest importer of Russian energy, behind only China, India, and Türkiye, with the bloc reportedly on track to shell out more than €20 billion for Russian oil, gas and uranium in 2025. The EU has moved to reduce its energy dependence on Russia, once its largest supplier, since February 2022. However expensive alternatives to Russian oil and gas have meant that private households and industry giants across the bloc have borne the brunt of higher energy prices – Germany’s automotive and chemical industries among them. The bloc’s latest round of sanctions introduced earlier this month target a so-called“shadow fleet”of vessels operating outside of Western insurance frameworks which Brussels claims is being used by Russia to evade G7-led efforts to enforce a price cap on its crude oil exports. Several EU countries have opposed the bloc's sanctions on Russia, with Hungary and Slovakia the most vocal among them. Last week, Italian-Russian Chamber of Commerce President Vincenzo Trani urged Rome to consider lifting sanctions against Moscow, saying that they are harming Italy’s economy. On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed the growth of the Russian economy over the past two years despite“rather difficult conditions.” He noted the country's economy has risen to fourth place globally by purchasing power parity (PPP) – an analysis metric that compares economic productivity and living standards between countries by adjusting for differences in the cost of goods and services – behind only China, the US, and India.",

    "article_text": "US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent requested the omission of“explicit language”on lowering the price cap for Russian oil from the joint statement of G7 finance ministers last week, the Financial Times has reported, citing officials briefed on the meeting. During the gathering in the Canadian town of Banff, rotating chair Canada reportedly proposed including clear wording on tightening the oil price restrictions. The move was backed by France, Germany, Italy, the UK, and the EU. However, it was dropped at the request of Bessent, the FT claimed on Tuesday. The final communiqué pledged only to“continue to explore all possible options, including options to maximize pressure such as further ramping up sanctions”if no ceasefire in the Ukraine conflict is reached. Brussels is currently drafting its 18th sanctions package against Russia since the escalation of hostilities in 2022. The European Commission has reportedly proposed reducing the current $60 per-barrel cap on Russian crude to $45 – a change that would require unanimous EU approval and coordination with G7 partners. The New York Times reported on Monday that US President Donald Trump is reluctant to tighten sanctions against Russia after holding a phone call with President Vladimir Putin last week. Meanwhile, the paper claimed, citing sources, that Trump is considering a complete withdrawal from the Ukraine peace process due to a lack of progress. According to Axios, the US president told European leaders that he believes“Putin wants a deal”and that diplomacy remains possible. Kiev and its European backers have called for additional restrictions after Moscow rejected a Ukrainian demand for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire earlier this month, an idea viewed in Russia as an attempt by Kiev to gain a military advantage. Russian officials are currently working on a peace framework that could set the stage for an eventual halt to the fighting. Russia has repeatedly dismissed EU sanctions as ineffective and illegal. Following the announcement of the bloc’s 17th package last week, Russian state defense conglomerate Rostec condemned the bloc as“a champion of meaningless measures.”",

    "article_text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin will visit China to attend events marking the 80th anniversary of its victory over Imperial Japan in World War II, Security Council Secretary Sergey Shoigu has said. Shoigu made the announcement on Tuesday during talks in Moscow with Chen Wenqing, the head of the Chinese Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission. Chen is visiting Russia for the 13th International Meeting of High Representatives for Security Issues, a three-day forum running through May 29, which has drawn delegations from more than 100 countries. “The Russian president will pay a return visit to China in September…”Shoigu said. China officially commemorates the defeat of Imperial Japan each year on September 3, marking Tokyo’s surrender in 1945 and the end of World War II in Asia. Shoigu’s announcement follows Chinese President Xi Jinping’s state visit to Moscow earlier this month, where he joined other world leaders for the May 9th Victory Day celebrations marking the Soviet Union’s defeat of Nazi Germany. During the talks with his Chinese counterpart, Putin emphasized that both Russia and China remain committed to preserving historical truth and remembering the wartime sacrifices of their nations. “The Soviet Union gave 27 million lives, laid them on the altar of the Fatherland and on the altar of Victory. And 37 million lives were lost in China’s war for its freedom and independence. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, this victory was achieved,”Putin said, stressiing the sacrifices“should never be forgotten.” The two leaders held wide-ranging discussions and signed multiple agreements aimed at expanding bilateral cooperation. The sides also issued a joint declaration on global strategic stability. Chinese Foreign Ministry described Xi’s visit to Moscow as“a complete success.”",

    "title": "Germany risks becoming a target for Russia – for the first time since Hitler",
    "article_text": "Chancellor Friedrich Merz, from Germany’s mainstream CDU/CSU conservatives, has caused a stir. This time with statements about German weapons in Ukraine. Or to be precise, how exactly Kiev’s troops may use weapons provided by Berlin. Speaking at a public forum organized by a major German TV station,Merz declared that there are no range limitsanymore on how far the Ukrainian military can shoot German weapons into Russia. Merz’s statements managed to be both sensational (sort of) and a muddle. He implied that they mark a change, but by now his Social Democrat coalition partnersand even Merz himselfare saying the opposite: That he wasn’t telling us anything new. It seems Merz has been improvising without thinking things through. In that case, no biggie. That’s just the way he is: Not as dissimilar from the American impulse monster Donald Trump as the dour chancellor from orderly Germany may wish to imagine. Moreover, the weapons – the MARS II system and the Panzerhaubitze 2000 – that Ukraine currently has from Germany only have modest ranges (84 and 56 kilometers). Removing political limits on them is largely militarily irrelevant. But what if Merz has been more devious? That is an interpretation popular with those German politicians who want to drag Germany even deeper into the great Western proxy war against Russia via Ukraine. For his fellow conservative – and head of the Defense Committee of the German parliament – Thomas Roewekamp, Merz’s explicit ‘no’ to any range restrictions for German weaponsis meant to prepare the ground for delivering the powerful Taurus cruise missile to Kiev. According to Roewekamp, under Merz’s predecessor, Olaf Scholz, the Taurus’ longrange of over 500 kilometerswas used as an argument against handing it over to Ukraine. By that logic, dropping range limits means facilitating the Taurus transfer, long the wet dream of German bellicist politicians, as well as somevery high-ranking officers. Unsurprisingly, Germany’s militaristic camouflage Greens have already renewed their habitual calls for further escalation by delivering the Taurus to Kiev. The great risks of this step are well known, but large parts of Germany’s elite seem to be in denial about them: Not only can the Taurus strike deep into Russia – or at least try, against Russia’s air defenses – and even hit Moscow, it is also a fact –as the head of the German air force admittedwhen feeling unobserved – that the Ukrainian military cannot handle the Taurus on its own. The complexity of its guidance, programming, and launching require that Germans will play a direct role in its use against Russia. Therefore, even if firedfromUkraine, a Taurus would also be firedbyGermany. Moscow – whether it intercepts the missile or not – will then have little choice but to consider Germany not ‘merely’ an important proxy force behind Ukraine, but a direct opponent. Russia would, simply put, be at war with Germany. A major Russian defense expert has already appeared on Russia’s most popular political show – 60 Minutes – arguing that in this case, Moscow should, at a minimum, conduct a limited, non-nuclear but certainly painful missile strike against the Taurus production facilities in Germany. Delivering the Taurus to Kiev has always been an awful idea, especially because even German officershave long acknowledgedthat it cannot even make a decisive difference in Ukraine’s favor. All the Tauruscando is help a desperate Ukrainian regime escalate the war to a higher level by involving NATO member Germany directly. That is certainly a Kamikaze option that the most reckless hawks in NATO-EU Europe would welcome, insane as it would be. So why has Merz sent this odd signal now? Is he one of those hawks? Does he want a direct war with Russia? Probably not, at least not too soon. For Merz is obsessed with the idea of massively remilitarizing Germany, precisely because he argues – and probably even believes – that it is far too weak right now. At the same time, he knows that this re-armament – with the explicit aim of providing Germany with the strongest army, at least in conventional terms,“in Europe”(let’s not dwell on his clearly politicized notion of ‘Europe’) – will take years. If, that is, it should ever succeed. Merz claimed that his statement was the proper response to a wave of Russian drone and missile attacks last weekend. The German politicians who support the chancellor’s latest sally agree with this claim and depict these Russian attacks not only as large-scale, which they wereand as Russia’s Defense Ministry has publicly recognized, but also as targeting civilians, which they clearly were not. Yet the evidence contradicts both charges: First, it is obvious that Moscow was not aiming at civilians. How do we know that? No, you do not have to take Russia’s word for it. Instead, treat the question empirically and consider the following figures,reported not by Russian media, but by the important and reliable Ukrainian news site Strana.ua: Over the last weekend, beginning Friday night and ending Sunday night, Russia launched a total of 92 missiles and over 900 drones at Ukraine. The Ukrainian military admits almost 30 direct hits on unspecified locations. Since Ukraine has a policy of not disclosing military losses while maximally exploiting civilian losses for information war purposes, we can assume that these locations were military or military-production sites, preciselyas Russia has claimed. In addition, according to the Ukrainian Air Force andGerman mainstream media, during Monday night, Russia launched 60 drones at Ukraine. What about civilian losses during these attacks then? Let’s be clear: Every human life is precious, every death terrible, and every injury deplorable. Yet proportions do matter. For the Russian weekend attacks, we find the following Ukrainian and Western (again, not Russian) figures about civilian losses: As of Saturday,the BBC reported“at least 13 people”killed and“56 civilians”injured in all of Ukraine. According to Strana.ua, Russian air attacks during Sunday night left16 dead, including three children, (a total of 12 deathsaccording to the Washington Post); Monday night –ten cases of injuries. These figures aren’t perfectly clear. When the number of those killed, for instance, is reported as simply ‘people’ (not specifically ‘civilians’), it makes sense to assume that this does refer to civilians (because, again, Ukraine follows a policy of not disclosing military losses). There are some discrepancies; there may be overlaps. On the other hand, unlike in the case of Israel’s genocidal bombardment of Gaza – a textbook case of actually targeting civilians – we do know that there is no significant difference between the numbers we see and the actual numbers of victims. For Gaza, all figures we currently have are certain to be substantial undercounts. The crucial point is as clear as can be: The figures from Ukraine do not constitute the footprint of attacks targeting civilians – especially if these attacks involved almost 100 missiles and nearly 1,000 drones. Indeed, these figures are not even evidence of Russian indifference to civilian losses. If anything, tragic as they are, they show that Russia must have taken care to avoid civilian ‘collateral damage’. In Ukraine, this may be a painful fact to acknowledge – in the West, a politically inconvenient one – but any other reading of the available statistics makes little sense. It is not only Friedrich Merz, but also Donald Trump who urgently needs to get real about the above.Trump has postedthat“a lot of people”are being killed. If he means Ukrainian officers and soldiers, then we simply don’t know. In any case, that is not a crime in war. And Americans have certainly never shown the slightest hesitation to kill combatants in spades (or civilians, for that matter). If Trump means civilians – as his phrase“in cities”may imply – then he is simply wrong. One is one too many, as always, but if the US president wants to see what ‘a lot of’ killed civilians look like, again, he should look at Israel’s deliberate slaughter of the Palestinians. A slaughter he is supporting, aiding, and abetting no less than his predecessor, Joe Biden. But back to Merz. There he is, making an escalating statement that seems to make an important difference, but then does not. Or will it, in the end? And his main reason for making it – or at least the main reason he has shared with us – is simply nonsense based on disinformation. What can we make of all that, except that Bismarck this is not? Not even Helmut Kohl or Angela Merkel, really. Maybe this is supposed to be an exercise in ‘strategic ambiguity’, a silly Frenchhabit recently proudly claimed by German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius? If so, Berlin needs to become much more discerning about the Parisian fashions it imports.",

    "title": "EU adopts €150 billion defense debt plan",
    "article_text": "The Council of the European Union has formally endorsed a plan to fund military buildup efforts across the bloc through a €150 billion ($170 billion) borrowing mechanism. The initiative comes after Washington announced it would ramp down its involvement in Europe’s defense. The financing arrangement will allow the European Commission to raise funds for military purposes without direct European Parliament approval. It was finalized last week and received formal backing from foreign and European affairs ministers on Tuesday. Hungary reportedly abstained from the vote. Originally proposed in March, the Security Action for Europe (SAFE) initiative was presented as a way to reduce reliance on US weaponry and a response to what Brussels claims to be a threat from Russia. Moscow has repeatedly denied any aggressive intent, accusing EU leaders of“irresponsibly stoking fears”to justify increased military expenditures. Several member states have already unveiled plans to expand their military capabilities under the SAFE framework while others have reportedly been considering using the program to provide additional arms assistance to Kiev. Under the rules of the agreement, at least 65% of a military project’s value must originate from EU countries or select partners such as the United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan, and Ukraine in order to qualify for funding. Efforts to boost European military production and procurement comes as US President Donald Trump has urged European NATO members to take the matter of defense into their own hands and increase military spending. Trump has threatened to pull American protection from countries that fail to pay up. The German newspaper Handelsblatt has also recently claimed that Washington is planning to announce a reduction of its US military presence in Europe in the“coming months.”The potential scale of such a pullout is unclear. Meanwhile, Moscow has condemned the EU’s new debt initiative as a continuation of the bloc’s hostile policies and increasing militarization. Russian officials have said that the EU’s military spending hikes amount to an“incitement of war on the European continent”and are evidence that the economic bloc has“has degraded into an openly militarized entity.”",

    "title": "Germany threatens EU states with loss of funding",
    "article_text": "Germany would consider supporting a suspension of EU funding to Slovakia and Hungary if the countries continue to oppose the bloc's sanctions policy against Russia, Chancellor Friedrich Merz has warned. Bratislava and Budapest have also taken a critical stance towards Western policies regarding the Ukraine conflict. On Monday, the German chancellor lifted Kiev’s restrictions on firing long-range German weapons deep inside Russia, a move the Kremlin has described as a“serious escalation.” Referring to Hungary and Slovakia, Merz warned that EU member states violating the rule of law could face infringement proceedings, adding that“withdrawing European funds is always an option…If it is necessary, then we will deal with it.” Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban have repeatedly criticized EU leaders and argued that the West’s military and financial backing of Kiev only prolonged the conflict, without yielding any progress. Fico survived an assassination attempt in May 2024, when he was shot at close range by a pro-Ukraine activist. ”We will not be able to avoid this conflict with Hungary and Slovakia if we continue on this course,”Merz said.“We cannot allow the decisions of the entire EU to depend on a small minority. And there could certainly be clearer words and possibly also harder conflicts.” Fico rejected Germany’s threat to cut funding, calling it unacceptable and a breach of the bloc’s democratic values. ”If someone wants to push a policy where only one opinion is allowed, that’s the end of democracy in Europe,”Fico told reporters on Tuesday during a visit to Armenia. Slovakia took what Fico calls a“constructive”and pragmatic approach towards Russia since he came to power in 2023. Under his leadership, Bratislava has cut military assistance to Kiev and pledged to veto any new EU sanctions that could harm Slovakia's economy. Fico has visited Moscow twice since December to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, drawing criticism from both the EU and NATO. “Europe needs Russia, and Russia needs Europe,”he said in a video message last week, reflecting on his visit to Moscow earlier this month.",

    "article_text": "The Hungarian authorities have denied permission for an LGBTQ parade in Budapest, invoking for the first time recent legislation that seeks to protect children from malignant influence. In a statement on Monday, Budapest police shot down a request for a pro-LGBTQ event planned for this weekend and supported by five human rights groups, including Amnesty International Hungary. They cited a recent amendment that prioritizes the right of children to“adequate physical, mental, and moral development”over other freedoms. The authorities were acting based on a law adopted in March, which prohibits pride events and authorizes the use of facial recognition technology to identify participants, with potential fines of up to $500. In April, the Hungarian parliament also passed a constitutional amendment recognizing only two genders – male and female – while defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman. The legislation was supported by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, an ardent critic of“woke policies.”While advocating for the law banning LGBTQ pride events, Orban said it is necessary to protect minors from“the international gender network”and“harmful agendas”promoted by bureaucrats in Brussels. In response to the ban, 17 EU countries released a joint declaration saying they“are highly alarmed by these developments which run contrary to the fundamental values of human dignity, freedom, equality and respect for human rights,”while urging Hungary to revise the legislation. EurActiv reported on Monday that the office of EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen privately recommended that commissioners not attend the much larger Pride march scheduled for late June in Budapest, so as not to“provoke”Hungary. The EU Commission has dismissed the report, saying von der Leyen“stands firmly for a true Union of Equality.”",

    "article_text": "Former Romanian presidential candidate Calin Georgescu has stated that he will be withdrawing from politics, following the victory of a pro-EU candidate in a presidential election rerun from which he was banned, earlier this month. Georgescu, a former UN official, ran as an independent in Romania’s November 2024 presidential election, campaigning on national sovereignty, criticism of Bucharest’s involvement in NATO and the EU, and opposition to continued military aid for Ukraine. Having won the initial round of voting, his victory was annulled by the country’s Constitutional Court, citing“irregularities”in his campaign along with intelligence reports alleging Russian interference—claims Moscow has denied. The election was rerun on May 18 without Georgescu on the ballot. In a video address published on Monday, Georgescu stated that he has chosen to become a“passive observer of public and social life”and to end his“active involvement in the political process, considering that this stage of the sovereignist movement has ended from my point of view.” He also stated that he would not join or lead any political party or attempt to hold“any position in the Romanian state in the current situation.”Instead, Georgescu said he will focus his attention and energy on his family. Georgescu left open the possibility of returning to public life, if he sees that“the rights of those who have chosen differently are being violated or injustices and abuses arise.” Romania’s electoral authorities banned Georgescu from taking part in this month’s rerun - a decision that was also upheld by the Constitutional Court, citing alleged violations of campaign finance rules and national security concerns. He was replaced on the ballot by Euroskeptic candidate George Simion - the leader of the Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) party. Simion lost in the second round of voting to Bucharest Mayor and EU supporter Nicusor Dan. The right-wing candidate has since refused to recognize the results, citing a“coordinated international interference”campaign. Moscow has described Romania’s latest election as“strange, at the very least,”noting that Dan did not secure victory until Georgescu - the frontrunner - was disqualified. Telegram founder Pavel Durov also claimed last week that Nicolas Lerner, the head of French foreign intelligence, personally urged him to censor conservative voices on the platform ahead of the Romanian election.",

    "article_text": "Greenland is weighing the possibility of inviting Chinese investment to develop its mining sector in light of tensions with the US and limited engagement with the EU, the island’s business and mineral resources minister, Naaja Nathanielsen, told the Financial Times on Tuesday. An autonomous territory of Denmark, Greenland holds vast but hard-to-exploit reserves of minerals such as gold and copper. Foreign capital is essential for developing the resources, yet recent geopolitical tensions have made it difficult to secure reliable partnerships. “We are trying to figure out what the new world order looks like,”Nathanielsen said, adding that Greenland was“having a difficult time finding [its] footing”in evolving relationships with its Western allies. The Arctic island signed a memorandum of understanding with the US on mineral development during President Donald Trump’s first term. However, according to Nathanielsen, it’s coming to an end. The government in Nuuk had tried, unsuccessfully, to renew it during the administration of former US President Joe Biden. Following Trump’s return to office in January, Greenland hoped to revive discussions of renewing the memorandum. Instead, the US president talked about purchasing the island and refused to rule out using military force to assert US sovereignty over it. Nathanielsen called such statements“disrespectful and distasteful,”adding that Greenland“has no wish to be American.” China has shown interest in the Arctic’s mineral wealth, including oil, gas, and minerals. It has invested in Russian energy projects and has expressed interest in Greenland's mining sector. No Chinese companies, however, are currently operating active mines in Greenland, although one firm holds a minority stake in an inactive project. According to Nathanielsen, Chinese investors might be holding back because they don’t want“to provoke anything.” “In those terms, Chinese investment is of course problematic, but so, to some extent, is American,”she said. Greenland would prefer closer cooperation with the EU, which aligns more closely with its environmental priorities, the minister said. However, the bloc’s engagement has been slow, with only one project, led by a Danish-French consortium, currently in development. The mine is expected to begin operations within five years. At present, Greenland has two functioning mines: one for gold, operated by the Icelandic-Canadian firm Amaroq Minerals, and another for anorthosite, a light-colored industrial rock, managed by a subsidiary of Canada’s Hudson Resources.",

    "article_text": "Türkiye is willing to host another round of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan has said. The diplomat added that his country sees the facilitation of peace as a national responsibility. Russia and Ukraine resumed direct talks earlier this month, marking a shift for Kiev, which abandoned diplomatic efforts in 2022 in favor of seeking a military victory. Speaking at a joint press conference in Moscow alongside Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Tuesday, Fidan reiterated Ankara’s readiness to serve as a mediator. ”We consider securing global peace our duty. Our president, Mr. [Recep Tayyip] Erdogan, has been strongly calling on the world community to seek peace since the start of the war,”Fidan said. The minister noted that on Monday he met with Vladimir Medinsky, the head of Russia’s negotiating delegation in Istanbul, as part of his official visit to Moscow. Fidan also said he had an opportunity to discuss bilateral relations with President Vladimir Putin. Lavrov praised Turkish hospitality, calling Istanbul“a very nice place,”and said he would personally prefer that the next round of peace talks be held there. Ukraine returned to the negotiating table following pressure from US President Donald Trump, who is attempting to mediate a truce between the two countries. Kiev and its European backers had demanded that Moscow agree to a 30-day unconditional ceasefire before any talks. The initial round of negotiations took place in Istanbul on May 16 and led to the largest prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine since the conflict intensified in 2022. Russian officials say they are drafting a roadmap that includes a conditional ceasefire designed to support further dialogue. Moscow has opposed Kiev’s proposal for a pause in hostilities, arguing it would allow Ukraine to regroup militarily. Trump had previously floated the idea of holding the second round of talks at the Vatican, but Russia expressed reservations. Lavrov remarked that the Catholic center would not serve as a neutral venue for negotiations between two predominantly Orthodox Christian nations. Moscow has accused the Ukrainian government of targeting Orthodox Christians in its broader campaign to suppress Russian culture.",

    "title": "NATO chief fears Trump-Zelensky conflict could derail summit – NYT",
    "article_text": "NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte fears that tensions between US President Donald Trump and Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky could undermine the bloc’s upcoming summit in the Netherlands, The New York Times reported on Monday. Citing European officials and diplomats, the outlet has said that Rutte has sought to keep the meeting“short and sweet”to avoid renewed public rifts over Ukraine’s bid to join the military bloc. The NATO summit, set for June 24–25 in The Hague, is expected to focus on accelerating militarization and Ukraine’s possible membership. According to the New York Times, Rutte and most European members support Kiev’s participation in the meeting. Russia has repeatedly called Ukraine’s NATO bid a red line and the main cause of the conflict. Trump’s reluctance to continue US support for Ukraine and his refusal to back its NATO bid have reportedly cast uncertainty over the meeting’s agenda. The US leader has repeatedly argued that Kiev should never have been considered for membership, admitting that it was one of the key triggers of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. Trump engaged in a heated exchange with Zelensky during a meeting at the White House in February, where he accused the Ukrainian leader of“gambling with World War III”by refusing to seek peace with Moscow. According to the NYT, Rutte now seeks to avoid“open disunity over Ukraine”by shortening the summit and minimizing discussion of controversial topics. While Zelensky is expected to attend, officials cited by the NYT have said he might not be invited to the main opening dinner. US Ambassador to NATO, Matthew Whitaker, has also stated that while Zelensky is expected to be at The Hague during the summit, his capacity is something the US is still“discussing.” The Italian agency ANSA has also reported that Washington is opposed inviting Vladimir Zelensky to the summit. This year’s event will not include a NATO-Ukraine Council session, NATO officials also told the NYT. Instead, leaders are only expected to meet briefly on the second day of the summit to ratify updated military spending targets. Concerns over Trump’s potential to derail the upcoming NATO summit come as the US president has reversed policies adopted by former US administrations and sought to rebuild contacts with Moscow. Last week, he held his third phone call in recent months with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which both leaders described the conversation as positive.",

    "title": "German officials reveal major change to Russia sanctions enforcement – media",
    "article_text": "EU officials in charge of enforcing Russia sanctions have lamented a major disconnection with Washington, following US President Donald Trump’s change in policy towards Moscow. According to a report by Süddeutsche Zeitung citing an internal document from Germany’s Foreign Office, the US and EU have failed to reach an agreement on efforts to counter circumvention of restrictions. Experts have warned the EU/US divide could spell an end to the Russia sanctions regime altogether. According to the document, the EU’s sanctions envoy David O’Sullivan lamented the lack of unity between Brussels and Washington towards anti-Russia restrictions, during a bloc Foreign Affairs Council meeting last week. Since the Ukraine conflict escalated in 2022, the US and EU have imposed sweeping sanctions to isolate Russia, including bans on seaborne oil, asset freezes, and restrictions targeting the country’s economy, trade, and defense sectors. Recent efforts have focused on alleged sanctions evasion, citing purported attempts by Russia to acquire weapons components through third parties using a so-called“shadow fleet,”a Western term for tankers operating outside recognised insurance systems. The EU has been pushing for additional measures to prevent vessels from operating, including by sanctioning Russia’s trade partners, such as China. According to the report, however, the US does not support Brussels’ moves: O’Sullivan at the meeting reportedly acknowledged a total breakdown in coordination with Washington on measures targeting Russia. “There is no more joint outreach,”he reportedly admitted, adding that G7 cooperation has also“lost momentum.” US President Donald Trump has threatened tougher sanctions on Russia if negotiations to end the Ukraine conflict fail, without naming any concrete proposals. He has repeatedly noted that he looks forward to boosting trade and economic cooperation with Russia once the conflict is over. Officials cited in the report believe he is looking to restore business ties sooner rather than later. A recent Bloombergreportciting EU sources also claimed the US has become“unresponsive”in working groups focused on sanctions enforcement. The next EU sanctions package is expected to target Russia’s energy and banking sectors, the report notes, but its approval is now uncertain. Hungary, which has repeatedly opposed sanctions, is reportedly blocking key elements of the proposal. Washington’s fading support has further cast doubt on its passage. German MEP Sergey Lagodinsky told Süddeutsche Zeitung that a full US withdrawal from the sanctions regime would likely bring the entire system to a halt.“The problem is that the US has been the de facto driving force behind the sanctions,”he said. Moscow has repeatedly denounced Western sanctions as illegal and ineffective, arguing they have failed to destabilize the Russian economy and have instead backfired on the countries that imposed them.",

    "article_text": "US Senator Lindsey Graham has claimed that his plan to hit Russia's trade partners with 500% tariffs would help President Donald Trump push Moscow towards a peace deal with Ukraine. At the same time, this would rebuild America’s reputation after the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan under Joe Biden, Graham said. Graham, a longtime foreign policy hawk and Trump ally, is backing legislation that would impose a 500% tariff on countries that buy Russian energy, uranium, and other raw materials – measures aimed chiefly at India and China. The senator linked the situation to Afghanistan in an op-ed published by the Wall Street Journal on Monday, described as“a message”to Russian President Vladimir Putin. “America’s shameful withdrawal from Afghanistan didn’t merely damage our reputation; it set in motion aggression across the world,”the South Carolina Republican wrote.“If the US continues to lead decisively on bringing the Russia-Ukraine war to an end, that could change. Mr. Trump can restore our reputation – and end the bloodbath.” Biden’s handling of the 2021 exit from Afghanistan, which included the swift collapse of American-trained local forces and the Taliban’s return to power in Kabul, has remained a frequent line of attack from Republicans. Critics have warned that Trump could make a similar blunder as he seeks to mediate an agreement between Moscow and Kiev. The president has claimed that the Ukraine conflict would not have broken out had he been in office instead of Biden. Graham’s commentary responded to a recent editorial from the Wall Street Journal’s board, which urged Trump not to distance himself from the conflict. ”It’s pure fantasy to imagine that Mr. Trump can ‘walk away’ and let Mr. Putin win without damaging consequences,”the newspaper wrote, accusing Trump of“acting like the war is someone else’s problem.” Kiev and its European backers have called for additional sanctions after Moscow rejected a Ukrainian demand for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire – an idea viewed in Russia as an attempt by Kiev to gain unilateral military advantage. Russian officials are currently working on a peace framework that could set the stage for an eventual halt in fighting.",

    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump’s plans for a new“Golden Dome”anti-ballistic missile defense system will fuel a nuclear arms race, North Korea has said. Unveiled by Trump last week, the initiative would provide a multilayered shield against long-range threats to the US. Some interceptor weapons would be deployed in space, and the system would reportedly include the capacity to strike launch sites before a missile is fired. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated the project could cost more than $542 billion over a 20-year period. North Korea reiterated its objections in a memorandum released by the Foreign Ministry’s Institute for American Studies, describing the Golden Dome as an inherently offensive system and a“malignant factor”fueling a global strategic arms race. The findings were reported by state media on Tuesday. The memorandum accused Washington of attempting to militarize space, meaning nations not aligned with the US would be forced to pursue symmetrical nuclear capabilities as their only means of self-defense. It also warned that US“satellite states,”including South Korea and Japan, could be drawn into American military strategy and serve as“cannon fodder”in future conflicts. The project is“a typical product of ‘America first’, the height of self-righteousness, arrogance, high-handed and arbitrary practice, and is an outer space nuclear war scenario supporting the US strategy for uni-polar domination,”the state-run Korean Central News Agency said. Last week, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said all nations have the sovereign right to develop means of countering perceived threats, when asked specifically about the Golden Dome. However, Moscow has consistently opposed the militarization of space and actions it views as destabilizing to the global strategic balance. President Vladimir Putin, speaking at his annual press conference last December, underscored Russia’s efforts to ensure that its nuclear-capable weapons could defeat all possible countermeasures. He argued that decades of American investment in anti-ballistic missile infrastructure“cost a lot to taxpayers and contribute little to the security for their country.”",

    "title": "Trump could exit Ukraine talks – NYT",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump is considering a complete withdrawal from the Ukraine peace process due to a lack of progress, the New York Times reported on Monday, citing sources. The US leader, however, is reportedly reluctant to tighten sanctions against Russia. Trump appeared to express the sentiment following a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week as he spoke with several European leaders, the NYT reported. During the conversation, Trump shared his impression that“Putin thought he was winning the war and would press his advantage,”according to officials briefed on the matter. They also reportedly indicated that Trump“made it clear he had no intention on putting pressure, much less harsh economic sanctions, on Russia.” “He said, essentially, ‘I’m out,’”an NYT source claimed. At the same time, the paper would not say whether Trump, who has been skeptical of US aid to Ukraine and has yet to approve new assistance packages, might be willing to continue military support for Kiev. Trump, who has described the Ukraine conflict as“Europe’s war,”was shocked by Moscow’s unwillingness to change its key terms of resolving the crisis, according to the NYT. Russia has insisted that any sustainable peace must include guarantees of Ukraine’s neutrality, its demilitarization, denazification, and recognition of the new territorial reality on the ground. A separate Wall Street Journal report also claimed that Trump is increasingly frustrated with the peace process and may abandon it entirely if current efforts fail. The paper suggested that the US leader is eyeing new sanctions against Russia, although no final decision has been made. The reports come after Trump claimed that Putin“has gone absolutely CRAZY,”rebuking Moscow for firing“missiles and drones… into cities in Ukraine for no reason whatsoever.” Moscow said its recent strikes targeting Ukrainian military-related facilities were retaliation for a significant increase in Kiev’s drone raids into Russia. Russian officials reported near-daily interceptions of over 100 Ukrainian UAVs, suggesting that the strikes are meant to derail the peace process. Responding to Trump’s remarks, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted that the start of the negotiation process is a“very important moment which is fraught with emotional overload”on all sides. He also stressed that Putin makes decisions“required for the security of our country,”while praising the efforts of the Trump administration to broker an end to the conflict.",

    "title": "The Best Summer Wedding Suit 2025: 9 Options for Every Vibe",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. The best summer wedding suit will save you a world of headache. Think about it: Peak wedding season is a (*Ric Flair voice*) fit’-wearin’, wallet-drainin’, party-hoppin’ time of year—and the fact that it takes place during the sweltering stretch between June and August doesn't help. Which means the suit you save for job interviews and Valentine’s Day dinners won't cut it. That’s why we strongly recommend you invest in a suit like the below, tailored from breathable, featherweight fabrics with little to no lining, and neutral enough to handle a summer’s worth of weddings and the fit mashups that go with them—fromaloha shirtstovintage polosto good ol’ fashionedbutton-downs and ties—so they’ll never see you in the same thing twice. Oh, yeah, and did we mention a whole lot of 'em clock in at well under $1,000? Park that saved dough at the post-reception bar. Buck Mason Buck Mason Buck Mason Materials:7.7 oz. Italian cotton twill |Fit:Straight Don’t let Buck Mason’s everyman prices (or West Coast roots) fool you—these days, the upstart brand is fast evolving into one of the premier remixers of de-fussed blue-blooded style. Take, for example, its Graduate suit, an Ivy-inspired joint with enough bells and whistles to make even the most judicious menswear nerd swoon, all at a price that wallops dingier department-store fare. To less keen eyes, it might look like a souped-up riff ona dusty khaki number. To the real heads, though, it’s a lightweight, soft-shouldered, patch-pocketed, hook-vented American icon in the making. Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Materials:53% Cotton, 37% Linen, 10% Lyocell |Fit:Classic Yes, Abercrombie & Fitch, the mall brand best known for cargo shorts and plumes of Fierce cologne, makes suits. Not only that, they’re impressive. Dubbed the A&F Collins suit, it features swanky ‘80s-style details like a double breasted front, peak lapels, and 2x2 button closure matched with a classic-fit silhouette. Basically, if there was a 2025 remake ofWall Street, Gordon Gekko, would be wearing this. For under $300, the Moose did take some shortcuts. Namely, the adulterated linen fabric and a number of nerdy finer details. But that’s to be expected for the price tag. Unless you’ve got half your weekends booked with weddings, we wouldn’t worry about it. We saidit would dominate wedding seasonand we’re stand by those words. Because for the price, the design, and the fit, it’s just math. Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Materials:100% Italian linen |Fit:Relaxed Our budget and overall picks are unquestionably great options, but if you’ve got the bread and a desire to look sharper than the knife that’s cutting that wedding cake, Todd Snyder is where we’d point you. We’ve been head over heels with the menswear maestro’s Wythe suit, a rakishly relaxed suit that feels like a blend of Armani and Miles Davis. The tailoring is soft but with enough structure in the shoulder to still feel like a suit and not a shirt. The fabric is a breezy and luxurious Italian linen and comes in a deep, almost black, shade of charcoal brown—a great colorway that can translate beyond weddings and into the office. We love a creamy white suit for summer, but you won’t get much wear out of ‘em as you might think. And if you’re going to spend the dough on a nice suit—a really nice suit—you may as well get one that has range. Banana Republic Banana Republic Banana Republic Banana Republic Materials:100% wool from Vitale Barberis Canonico |Fit:Tailored slim Yes! Youcanwear wool in the summer. There are plenty of tropical wool suits on the market, but for the price, forget the rest and peel over to Banana Republic. The grown-up sibling to The Gap has it figured out with lightweight, loose-weave Italian tropical wool from the renowned Vitale Barbaris Canonico mill. It has as much texture and character as a heavy tweed, but at a featherlight weight and AC-like breathability. As for fit, it’s cut with a classic, slightly trim silhouette, wide-ish notch lapels, and natural shoulders. The best part? You won’t have to worry about this suit getting wrinkled like with linen or cotton. And what’s more is you don’thaveto wear this in the summer. Tropical wool is great for the warmer months, sure, but you can easily rock it in spring and even the fall. When things start to get nippy, make sure you switch your suits over to the heavier stuff. Stòffa Stòffa Stòffa Stòffa Materials:100% linen |Fit:Relaxed Someday soon, your richest friend will humbly request your presence in the South of France, and you will need a suit—or, at least, a suit-esque set—to match the vibe of the occasion. Needless to say, the suit in question shouldn’t be your trusty 9-to-5 standby: it should be breezy, casual, and unlike any other two-piece in your rotation. In other words, it should feel a lot like Stòffa’s pajamas-adjacent washed linen set, which will make you look like you just jumped off the PJ, not out of bed. It’s a little boxy andverydrapey, thanks to a drawstring waist and a sleazy camp collar that leaves little to the imagination, but that’s fine (it’s France, after all). What were you going to do—rock the same blue suityou wear to work? We thought so. J.Crew J.Crew J.Crew J.Crew If the wedding you’re attending is projected to be a real scorcher and the dress code is casual enough, you might get to show off a little leg. It’s fairly uncommon to see a suit jacket paired with tailoredshorts, and even less common to see one that looks as good as J.Crew’s does. It’s got an indulgently roomy silhouette that’ll let the breeze blow right through with perfectly-proportioned shorts that reach to the natural waist. But don’t let that description fool you, this suit can be almost as dressy as a supremely tailored tux if you play it right (all you need is a good white or tobacco-brown linen shirt and clean loafers). Polo Ralph Lauren Polo Ralph Lauren Polo Ralph Lauren Polo Ralph Lauren When you think of a beautiful, softly tailored suit, the kind with an ease and panache you’d find only in heady, idyllic foreign films, you probably aren’t thinking of Ralph Lauren. But the all-American Ralph makes some of the most debonair suiting this side of the Atlantic while looking right at home on the Italian coast (even if your summer wedding is in San Antonio, Texas). This all-linen suit has got natural, lightly padded shoulders, a subtly structured chest, and an airy unlined construction. Finished with killer details like pickstitching at the lapels and corozo-like buttons, this is the next-best thing to actually flying to Italy for a custom suit. Spier & Mackay Spier & Mackay Seersucker, for all its Southernness and Kentucky Derby associations, actually has origins in India. Usually made of a lightweight cotton, the fabric is woven in a way that produces a characteristically wavy surface which resists sticking to the wearer’s skin and adds airflow. It’s become a symbol of southern dress, sure, but if you don’t want to look like you’re getting ready to bet on horses or for Sunday church, we suggest avoiding the blue and white stripe versions. Instead opt for a solid colorway like this one from Spier & Mackay. Made of a high-quality, lightweight English seersucker, it features a ton of menswear-y details like a 3-roll-2 button closure, Milanese button holes, ultra soft shoulders, and plenty more. In other words, this is the perfect suit for that destination wedding in Sicily (or for just stunting at the courthouse). Drake's SSENSE Drake's SSENSE Read enough guides to occasion-specific tailoring, and you’ll encounter no shortage of pithy, alliterative soundbites extolling any given suit’s versatility, “from point A to point B” and back again. The boardroom to the bar; the trail to the taco stand; the dais to the dance floor—you get the picture. The notion is a little hackneyed at this point, but we understand the impulse—and are just as eager to help you find a suit you can wear on your pal's big day and to work the following Monday. Enter the Drake’s Games suit, which combines the best traits of your chillest blazer and trustiest chore coat. Crafted from a cunning navy cotton-linen blend, the jacket features two hefty flap pockets, one regular-sized patch pocket, and a ventless back, which gives it a boxier, more casual shape designed for solo wear. Pair it with the matching, chino-adjacent pants and you’ve got a suit you can rock to your mountain-dwelling bestie's forestry affair or to a classic chapel ceremony—even if the AC hasn't been operational since the place opened. Style is subjective, we know—that’s the fun of it. But we’re serious about helping our audience get dressed. Whether it’s thebest white sneakers, theflyest affordable suits, or the need-to-knowmenswear drops of the week, GQ Recommends’ perspective is built on years of hands-on experience, an insider awareness of what’s in and what’s next, and a mission to find the best version of everything out there, at every price point. Our staffers aren’t able to try on every single piece of clothing you read about on GQ.com (fashion moves fast these days), but we have an intimate knowledge of each brand’s strengths and know the hallmarks of quality clothing—from materials and sourcing, to craftsmanship, to sustainability efforts that aren’t just greenwashing. GQ Recommends heavily emphasizes our own editorial experience with those brands, how they make their clothes, and how those clothes have been reviewed by customers. Bottom line: GQ wouldn’t tell you to wear it if we wouldn’t. We make every effort to cast as wide of a net as possible, with an eye on identifying the best options across three key categories:quality,fit, andprice. To kick off the process, we enlist the GQ Recommends braintrust to vote on our contenders. Some of the folks involved have worked in retail, slinging clothes to the masses; others have toiled for small-batch menswear labels; all spend way too much time thinking about what hangs in their closets. We lean on that collective experience to guide our search, culling a mix of household names, indie favorites, and the artisanal imprints on the bleeding-edge of the genre. Then we narrow down the assortment to the picks that scored the highest across quality, fit, and price. Across the majority of our buying guides, our team boasts firsthand experience with the bulk of our selects, but a handful are totally new to us. So after several months of intense debate, we tally the votes, collate the anecdotal evidence, and emerge with a list of what we believe to be the absolute best of the category right now, from the tried-and-true stalwarts to the modern disruptors, the affordable beaters to the wildly expensive (but wildly worth-it) designer riffs. Whatever your preferences, whatever your style, there's bound to be a superlative version on this list for you. (Read more about GQ's testing processhere.)",

    "title": "Timothée Chalamet Went Full Jack Nicholson in Indiana",
    "article_text": "If you thought—even for a moment!—that Timothée Chalametwouldn’ttrek to Indianapolis to watch his beloved Knicks beat the Pacers in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals, thenyou haven’t been paying attention. Indeed, the Oscar nominee, who seems to have put his professional schedule on hold for the duration of the Knicks’ 2025 postseason run, spent at least one night of his Memorial Day weekend in the Midwest doing the same thing he’s done for many nights over the last two months: sitting courtside at a professional basketball game while outfitted ina conspicuous ensemble, sipping an ice-cold beverage from a plastic cup, and screaming his head off for the Knickerbockers. It helped that his team won by a hair on Sunday evening, but by that point, Chalamet had already garnered admiration for his latest playoffs-themed fashion statement. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. For the fourth game in a row, Timmy wore custom clothing from the Los Angeles brandChrome Hearts; this time, a logo-striped button-up shirt with electric-blue trousers embroidered with the label’s gothic-cross emblem. (In February, the brand notably made Timmya full baby-pink lookfor the Berlin premiere of his Bob Dylan biopic,A Complete Unknown.) The label has produced a number of one-off pieces—including a pair of Timberland boots embroidered with blue-and-orange crosses—for Chalamet to wear courtside in recent weeks, as the actor follows in the Jordan-shaped footprints ofSpike Lee, the most emphatically dressed Knicks fan of all time. In Indiana, Chalamet accessorized, inhis usual high-low fashion, with Oakley wraparound sunglasses with reddish polarized lenses, box-fresh whiteBapestas, and a gold Panthère de Cartier necklace. (The actor is an ambassador for the luxury jeweler.) “Timothée Chalamet is progressively turning into Jack Nicholson with every passing Knicks playoff game,” wentone viral post on X, echoing a chorus of onlookers who saw the actor’s louche sunglasses and swept-back ’do and connected the dots to fellow Hollywood basketball obsessive Nicholson’smemorable courtside styleas a longtime Lakers fan. He looked, perhaps more than ever, like a movie star. Others saw Timmy’s sporty wraparound shades, fluffy hair, and full-throated enthusiasm and raised comparisons to two other Midwestern-born legends: the much-memed professional bowler Pete Weber (“Who do you think you are? I am!”) and the much-memed TV chef Guy Fieri. Elsewhere on X, writer Ernest Wilkins offered succinct praise for Chalamet’s wild-style playoffs participation. “Cold Take: This is the exact point of being rich and famous,”Wilkins wrote. “If you had the $ and clout, why WOULDNT you trail your team like the Grateful Dead for the first meaningful playoff series of your lifetime like young Timotheeeee here.” Anyways, let’s check back here tonight for Game 4.",

    "title": "15 Best Swim Trunks for Men 2025: Tested by GQ",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. These days, the best swim trunks for men are more than just, well,swimtrunks—they’re justreally good shortsthat happen to know how to do the backstroke. From the fit to the fabric to the details, the swim shorts in this guide pair seamlessly with the rest of your wardrobe, and won't look a hair out of place whether you're hanging at home, heading out for a hike, or hitting the corner store down the street. And if the opportunity comes to take a dip in your buddy's pool, or spend the weekend at the sun-drenched locale of your choice? You'll be perfectly dressed and ready to go. So with all that in mind, here are the absolute finest multi-purpose, next-generation, and yes, all-around best men's swimming trunks to buy right now—all tested and reviewed byGQeditors. Bather Bather There’s a reason why Bather tops this guide every summer. For years the Toronto-based label has peddled the platonic ideal of a swim short, cut with an optimal inseam and in a silhouette that flatters every body type. It features a silky-soft mesh lining that’s comfortable and protective—and it’s made from 100% recycled quick-dry nylon that performs well in the water and won’t look out of place if you’re wearing it a few miles from the beach. In our testing, Bather trunks hold up like a champ through beach days, workouts, weekend hangs, and heavy wash cycles. They all pass the quick-dry test. “I only brought one pair of swim trunks with me on a recent trip, and I know swim trunks are supposed to dry fast, but damn, these were bone-dry faster than I could hop into the pool again,” saysGQassociate commerce editor Tyler Chin. He also loves the fit and that the inseam offers just enough thigh action without veering X-rated. The shorts also come in dozens of solid colors and wild patterns—from plain Jane navy and white to trippy florals—so it’s damn-near impossible not to find one that works for you. Patagonia Huckberry Patagonia If any one pair was responsible for launching the swimwear-as-shorts movement, it’d bePatagonia Baggies. For close to 40 years, they’ve been the signature warm-weather bottoms of hardcore mountaineers, deep sea fishers, camper van lifers, dedicated Deadheads, and backyard-grilling dads the world over. More recently—as the fashion world has gravitated toward practical, outdoorsy gear—they’ve also been adopted as the summer uniform for a certain strain of stylish young fella. It’s easy to see the appeal across all those demographics: they’re tough but lightweight, laidback but presentable, affordable as hell, trend-proof in fit and form and function. I've collected over 10 different colorways dating back a decade since I got my first pair (which naturally was black), and they've become an absolute essential for travel because of their sheer versatility. It's no wonder you'll spot these equally around town than you will around the pool. Birdwell Birdwell When it comes to board shorts, none may be more time-tested thanBirdwell. Since 1961, the brand's original two-ply, triple-stitched design is still as handsome, practical, and impossible to wear out as ever. But this year, the brand's newly redesigned 808 board short, which has all the anti-chafe trappings of the original model, but with a four-way stretch material, is our new favorite. While some purists will prefer the stiffness of the 300 and 310 models, the 808 is simply just more comfortable, and therefore a little more versatile for everyday life. It also helps they're available in the same bevy of classically tinged colorways. Whichever model you choose, if you're after some serious throwback, hang-ten, shaka-hand energy, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better pair of drawstring waist boardies than those from Birdwell. Sunspel Sunspel If you don’t think swim trunks have the sartorial range to be worn when there’s no water in sight, Sunspel’s Tailored Swim Short will make you a believer. The luxury British label’s classic trunk has a tailored fit with an adjustable waist and the same convenient pockets and zip fly as any regular short. Perhaps the best part is that the quick-dry fabric is made of all recycled material, the majority from upcycled marine plastic. “To call these trunks ‘rad’—orposh, in the parlance of our friends across the pond—is true, but it’s also woefully inadequate,” says GQ senior commerce editor Avidan Grossman. “I’m going to level with you: I’ve got zero ass to speak of and hips daintier than a ballet flat, and these flutter around my thighs with Baryshnikov-like grace.” Don’t let their tony pedigree fool you, either. Over the course of a year, Grossman has worn Sunspel’s swim shorts into the ground, with easy, breezy striped shirts andfisherman sandals—but also threadbarewhite teesand thrashed Vans. “I hate the beach,” Grossman adds. “These might be the only valid reason to go.” Stone Island Mr. Porter Fabric:|Sizes:| Liner:Mesh liner We’ve tested our fair share of luxury swim trunks, and while we still stand by our past picks, which include handsome shorts fromFrescobol CariocaandOrlebar Brown, we are quite taken by the quiet flex that comes with sporting Stone Island’s Nylon Metal Swim Shorts. Everything about these shorts—in terms of colors, design, silhouette, and fabric—is subtle. But a closer inspection reveals a highly considered swim trunk cut from quick-dry recycled nylon fabric with an unmistakable iridescent crinkle texture. GQcommerce writer Gerald Ortiz, who believes many swim trunks suffer from garish colors and patterns, appreciates that Stone Island takes “the more difficult route of stripping away the extraneous details and focuses on materials.” The fabric is solid,” he says, “but far from boring thanks to the luxe feel and the mesmerizing metallic sheen.” Outerknown Outerknown The headline of Outerknown’s Apex trunk is right in its name: It was developed and tested by 11-time world surfing champ Kelly Slater. But you don’t have to be a wave enthusiast to appreciate the fact that the stretchy performance fabric is made from 100% post-consumer waste. Given that these linerless shorts are designed with water sports in mind, you also get stitch-free seams to reduce unnecessary chafing that would happen otherwise. “I didn’t do any extreme water sports in these, but I could see why a surfer would love them—they’re quite stretchy and don’t restrict your movement,” Chin says. He also adds that he prefers a shorter inseam on his swim trunks, but the overall look is perfectly fine. Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder's pull-on surf short—like many things Todd Snyder—is a luxe upgrade on a classic. In this case, the brand has upgraded the the regular board short or “baggie.” It's ideal for sweltering vacations, thanks to its quick-drying, lightweight Portuguese seersucker that also feels incredibly nice to run your hands over. Never one to scrimp on the details, Todd Snyder has also included an elastic drawstring waist, fine mesh liner, a self-draining back pocket, and a key holder to help you keep your car or room key secure even while hitting the surf. These 5-inch shorts hit around the mid-thigh, but Todd also makes them in alonger 7-inch. CDLP CDLP CDLP’s slinky skivvies are a mainstay ofour underwear coveragefor a many a sexy reason. In the case of the Swedish label’s signature swim shorts, those flourishes take the form of a planet-friendly Econyl satin twill fabric and daringly short inseam. Ten Thousand Ten Thousand A comfortable minimal waistband and compression liner, and bonded hems make this short one of the best performance trunks on the market. Available in a 5-inch or 6.5-inch inseam, it seamlessly transitions between water and land, which is all you can really ask for. Wellen Huckberry One for the comfort-heads, Wellen's supportive boxer brief-like lining is one of the softest we've tested. Coupled with the brand's 4-way stretch fabric, and you've got yourself a short that will never chafe, twist, or rub. Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Color and pattern options abound with Abercrombie's seersucker swim trunk, which also features a comfortable mesh compression liner. This swim short falls on the relaxed side, with an inseam that clocks in at seven inches. Outlier Outlier Outlier’s New Way Shorts can truly do it all, and look good while doing it. These boxy, relaxed shorts are the epitome of a hybrid short, with drawstrings and a lightweight breathable fabric that’ll dry quickly. If you're looking for a longer inseam, Outlier also offers theNew Way Seven Fives. Buck Mason Buck Mason If you're looking for tailored option, we like this offering from Buck Mason, which has all the trappings of vacation-ready short—a zipper fly, button closure, and an adjustable waistband—but also ready for a splash at a moment's notice. Ripa Ripa Huckberry We have the good people of Milan to thank for Ripa Ripa, the Italian label that’s responsible for some of our favorite vacation-ready swim shorts. These run on svelte European sizing, so consider sizing up. Vuori Vuori Vuori's status continues to rise, simply because very few guys who try their affordable, premium-feeling, fast-drying swim shorts ever look back.

    "title": "11 Best Hair Growth Serums of 2025 to Help Sprout New Roots",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. It can feel scary to seeyour hair fall outor yourhairline recede, hence your search for the best hair growth serums. You’re probably familiar with brands like Rogaine, which has an active ingredient known as minoxidil. Minoxidil (which helps to prevent the miniaturization of hair follicles) andfinasteride(which helps to block DHT, an ingredient that causes hair loss) are presently the gold standards when it comes to hair loss, according toDr. Macrene Alexiades, a New York City board-certified dermatologist. As is a treatment called PRP or “platelet-rich plasmas” injections where your blood is taken, spun in a centrifuge to obtain the plasma, and then injected back into the scalp. “I've obtained the best results forhair growthin my patients by implementing a comprehensive plan of oral supplementation, topical prescriptions including minoxidil and finasteride, and injections with platelet-rich plasma [or PRP] for ideal outcomes,” explains Alexiades. “As for serums, outside of topical minoxidil, finasteride or herbal equivalents such as saw palmetto, there are several serums where the jury is still out!” Below, she shares the best serums with growth-stimulating ingredients that might help stop hair thinning and even aid in regrowth. Hims Hims Key ingredients: MinoxidilPrice per ounce: $7.50 For years,Himshas become the go-to brand for those looking for a solution to their thinning hair. Why? Because it's cheaper than a flight to Turkey, and the stuff actually works. Our own Adam Hurly has tested Hims products for years, so much so that he's needed to recruit others to try out the products because his hair's already started growing back thicker and fuller. This affordable over-the-counter serum utilizes minoxidil, a popular vasodilator, to help hair grow back more densely, giving the appearance of a fuller head of hair. No, it won't actually help you regrow hair that's since been lost to time and genetics, but the strands you do have left will be doing more of the heavy lifting to give you a better-looking head of hair. Hair Thickness Maximizer Amazon Key ingredients: Saw palmetto, peppermint and cedarwood essential oilsPrice per ounce: $14.00 Not only is saw palmetto a natural ingredient, but it’s also fairly cost-effective compared to amped-up actives. While it's not going to give you the most marked hair growth on the market, Alexiades saysthat studies have indicatedthat it can help with hair loss, as something of an “herbal equivalent” to minoxidil or finasteride. The formula of this hair oil combines pumpkin seed, moringa, and flaxseed oils to promote overall hair health and to nourish strands that could be dry, damaged, or frizzy. Finally, peppermint and cedarwood essential oils provide both a soothing sensation on a stressed-out scalp and a nice scent to this serum. Ro Ro Key ingredients: Finasteride, minoxidil, tretinoinPrice per ounce: N/A Somehow the fine mist of this spray is super relaxing—and that’s partially because the brand has perfectly portioned each spritz to deliver the exact dose of the product you need. In addition to minoxidil, it contains tretinoin, which you might recognize from prescription retinol formulas. Because it helps to stimulate cell turnover,studies have shownthat it purportedly makes it easier for the scalp to effectively absorb the minoxidil and finasteride. This entire bottle will last you for up to one month, and it’s recommended that you use it on a daily basis. Rogaine Amazon Key ingredients: MinoxidilPrice per ounce: $8.50 This is probably the most recognizable brand for hair loss, and that’s because of the popularity of the brand's oral medications. That said, the serum is incredibly cost-effective because each order comes with a six-month supply of serum-style dropper bottles. It contains minoxidil, which works to stimulate follicle hair growth. While this is the only active ingredient, it has been clinically proven to be one of the most important. It also contains alcohol, which can be drying—especially if your scalp is experiencing any irritation. Cécred Ulta Key ingredients: Biopeptide-5, bioactive keratin fermentPrice per ounce: $8.50 Beyoncé's line of hair care products, Cécred, already had a huge following, and that was before someone online claimed that the brand's hair drops basically helped him to regrow a full head of hair. Whether you believe its results or not, we do think these drops are jam-packed with goodies that can potentially lead to a fuller-looking head of hair. This non-greasy serum uses five key peptides to give hair looking fuller and healthier, boosting scalp help to create and foster a better environment for hair growth. Existing strands get stronger and fuller, so they're less prone to breakage and falling out, while your noggin overall just smells good. (We're in the process of doing some long-term testing, so stay tuned for more here.) OneSkin OneSkin Key ingredients: OS-01 peptide, ginseng extract, fisetinPrice per ounce: $40.59 According to OneSkin, as you age, some cells enter a stage of senescence, thereby turning into senescent cells. These cells start to trigger premature aging, which can result in signs like thinning hair. This scalp serum is meant to prevent the accumulation of those senescent cells to encourage better, thicker hair growth, thereby reducing the appearance of aging—at least at the hair level. The serum does this by using a special peptide, as well as good-for-your-hair ingredients like the antioxidants fisetin, sunflower sprout extract, and rice bran water. Vegamour Amazon Key ingredients: GROActive+ Complex (brand’s proprietary complex), Spanish microalgea, plant stem cellsPrice per ounce: $78.00 While the price of this product can seem like a bit much, you only use a dropperful at a day so it will last longer than one month even if you use it daily as the brand recommends. This formula is not only intended to curb shedding, it’s also made with scalp hydration and hair density in mind. To help maintain a healthy scalp, Spanish microalgae serves as a prebiotic hydrator that will help build up the skin barrier. Finally, plant stem cells provide a protein-rich boost to the roots that help anchor and strengthen them. Briogeo Amazon Key ingredients: Caffeine, green coffee oil, biotin, copper peptidesPrice per ounce: $38.00 Often, curly hair types tend to be drier because the hair strand is like a spiral staircase rather than a straight shoot for the oil to travel down. Because of this hair can break and this breakage can lead to it looking sparser than it should When that happens, you'll want to stimulate the follicles to help hair grow. The formula also contains biotin, which naturally supports elasticity and strength while coating each strand to provide a thicker overall look. The copper peptides in the formula work to promote the production of collagen, which will definitely help the hair grow stronger over time. The caffeine and green coffee oil in the formula work hand-in-hand to stimulate the scalp, leaving each strand healthier overall. IGK Amazon Key ingredients: Biotin, peptides, pumpkin seed oilPrice per ounce: $21.00 While the biotin in this serum will help your hair look thicker, especially over time, this serum should be used more for the appearance of thicker hair versus actually promoting new growth. That said, peptides, which are included in this formula,have been foundto improve hair re-growth as well in a number of studies. This serum is great for fine hair not only because of the biotin, but also because of hair health-promoting ingredients like pumpkin seed oil, which nourishes hair and makes it both shinier and stronger. The brand recommends using it every night for best results, and to spray it on your most thin areas while holding the bottle 10 inches away from the scalp. From there, massage it into the scalp for several minutes before allowing it to dry. The Nue Co. Amazon Key ingredients: Redensyl, probiotics, rosemary oil, clary sage oil, and peppermint oilPrice per ounce: $14.00 This formula contains redensyl, which has been found to be effective in hair regrowth inclinical studies. While supporting new growth, it has also been found to protect existing hair follicles. In addition to this ingredient, the serum contains rosemary, which is great for stimulating blood flow. Blood flow is also a key component when it comes to supporting new hair growth. Probiotics come in to help out with overall scalp wellness, whichmany expertsbelieve could be one of the main keys to keeping hair healthy overall. The probiotics will also help with moisture retention and reduce the overall appearance of scalp dryness or dandruff. Living Proof Amazon Key ingredients: Antioxidants, amino acids, peptidesPrice per ounce: $38.00 Why not combat grays while you’re working on re-growth? This serum combines antioxidants and amino acids to create a blend that they’ve found has the ability to reduce both the appearance and the re-growth of gray hairs. They’ve lumped all of their density-promoting ingredients into a proprietary complex—the exact ingredients of which they don’t list out. That said, they do include amaranth peptides on their ingredient list, and these have been shown to potentially improve the diameter of each individual hair fiber over time. It comes in a serum-style dropper, and the brand recommends applying three droppers full of the stuff daily. They then recommend massaging it in and giving it some time to dry. All of their results were found after 90 days of usage. According to Dr. Hardik Doshi, a board-certified plastic surgeon who specializes in hair restoration atAmple Hair, there are plenty of over-the-counter (OTC) ingredients that are great for combating thinning hair. “OTC options like minoxidil-based topicals and ketoconazole shampoos enhance blood flow and scalp health, while nutritional supplements with biotin, vitamin D and iron support overall hair health,” says Doshi. “Prescription medications like finasteride for men inhibit DHT that’s linked to hair thinning, and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy, which is injecting concentrated platelets into the scalp, is an emerging option for stimulation.” Of course, he recommends consulting with a healthcare professional, especially if you plan on taking oral and topical treatments. “Consulting with a healthcare professional is crucial before starting any treatment, and adopting a holistic approach with a healthy lifestyle, proper nutrition, and stress management can complement topical and oral treatments for overall hair health,” he says. In our effort to try every single hair care product worth your time, we've subjected our domes to quite a few goops and serums to find the best recommendations for you. Some of these products have been personally vetted by us or people we know, while others were recommended by dermatologists who offered their wisdom to help find the best hair growth serums for most people. How do I use a hair growth serum? Noticing early signs of baldness? While Alexiades is adamant that people see a dermatologist to help them with their hair retention regimen, she also stresses the importance of proper application in order to achieve the best results. She also recommends applying the serums to \u0000“a clean dry scalp and not right before bed so it does not stain your pillowcase.” Here’s how to add a hair growth serum to your hair care routine. Do hair growth serums work? The best hair growth serums tend to include two ingredients, and it’s important to understand why doctors are prone to recommending both of them: finasteride and minoxidil. For minoxidil, it works to prolong the anagen phase of each individual hair follicle. This is the phase when hair follicles are actively producing new growth. Finasteride on the other hand, works by blocking a hormone called dihydrotestosterone, which is more commonly referred to as DHT. This hormone works to stop hair growth on the scalp. This is why you see so many formulations that pair minoxidil and finesteride (both of which are FDA approved) together—they work hand-in-hand to stop DHT production and to stimulate growth. Keep in mind that healthy hair growth will take some time, so don’t expect to instant or immediate effects. Plus, not all hair growth products actually work, which is why we enlisted the aid of experts to get their opinions on things that couldpotentiallywork. Incorporate these hair care products into your routine and over time, and we hope you’ll find healthier hair at the end of the road. When should someone expect to see results when using a hair growth product? According to double board-certified dermatologistDr. Saami Khalifian, it can take up to six months for hair to start growing back. “Hair growth is not instant,” he says. “It takes 3 to 6 months to start seeing changes, and full results can take up to a year. Hair grows in cycles, so patience and consistency are key.” What causes hair thinning? “Hair loss is driven by several key factors,” Khalifian says. “Genetics play the biggest role, with androgenetic alopecia (male or female pattern hair loss) being the most common cause. Hormones, particularly DHT, can shrink hair follicles over time, leading to gradual thinning. Chronic stress can trigger telogen effluvium, a condition where more hairs enter the shedding phase. Nutritional deficiencies, such as low iron, vitamin D, or protein, can also slow hair growth.”",

    "title": "9 Best Down Comforters of 2025 That Wrap You Up in Coziness",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. For top-tiersleep, we get down with the best down comforters, and here’s why: They’re insanely comfortable, plush, insulating yet breathable, and flat-out luxe. We’re talking the kind ofblanketthat makes you want to plop on yourbedat night and hit snooze when youralarmgoes off. It’s the ultimate cloud-like topper after you've snagged the rightpillow,sheets, andmattress. But before we dive in, let’s break down what “down” actually means. You know how feathers keep ducks and geese warm in the winter? Same principle here. Those soft under-feathers trap heat while staying light and fluffy, so your body stays cozy without overheating. Since this cozy goodness comes from feathery friends, it’s even more important to choose a quality brand—like Scandia Home, Brooklinen, or Parachute Home. Look for aResponsible Down Standard(RDS) certification orDownmarkcertification, which means it features quality fill and is ethically sourced (you’ll find that on all the picks in this roundup). If you’re not into feathers, down-alternative comforters are a quality option (and often vegans and good for many allergy-prone individuals). Along with the craft, because down comforters are also generally long-lasting, they come with a high sticker price (cue the jump scare). Don’t worry, though, we’ve got options to fit a range of budgets. Quince Quince Sizes:Twin, Full, Queen, King, Cal KingFill:white downWeight options:Lightweight, all-season, ultraWarranty:365-day return policyCare:Spot clean recommended, dry clean if needed This direct-to-consumer brand has made a name for itself by offering quality essentials (think clothes, furniture, home goods) at prices that won’t make you do a double take. Luckily for those chasing better sleep (and better bedding), that includes its down comforters. At only $200, it checks all the boxes: Responsibly Sourced Down-certified white down, 650 fill power, baffle box construction for even distribution, and corner loops to keep your duvet cover in place. With all that, the price is practically unheard of, but that’s the perk of cutting out the middleman. Brooklinen Brooklinen Sizes:Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, Cal KingFill:Goose downWeight options:Lightweight, all-season, ultra-warmWarranty:Optional returns within 365 days, plus extended one-year warrantyCare:Spot clean recommend You’ve probably come across Brooklinen while browsing the bedding section in department stores. We’ve kept their all-season comforter on the list because it consistently delivers on quality, comfort (warm without overheating), and has earned thousands of high-praise reviews. Made with 100-percent Canadian down, it’s available in all sizes: lightweight, all-season, and ultra-warm, ranging from 650 to 750 fill power. It has a big fluff factor and doesn’t bunch thanks to its baffle box construction. The only caveats is its more in the mid-range price point (a bit on the steeper end) and it’s not machine-washable. Scandia Home Scandia Home Sizes:Twin, queen, kingFill:Goose downWeight options:Ultra light, light, medium, ultraWarranty:Limited lifetime warrantyCare:Professional dry clean With Scandia Home, you get what you pay for (in the best way). I would know—I’ve used their comforters for years, and mine hasn’t let up. No feather leaks, no clumping, just even loft that feels as good as the day I got it. Yes, the sticker price is steep, but there’s a limited lifetime warranty and the craftsmanship speaks for itself. This bestselling comforter is packed with 600-fill-power European white down that’s Responsible Down Standard-certified, meaning it meets the highest ethical standards when sourcing from feathery friends. A crisp, 300-thread-count cotton cambric shell keeps it breathable, while double hand-stitched edging ensures durability. Available in three sizes and three weights, it’s the kind of investment that’ll give you that luxury hotel feel. Feathered Friends Feathered Friends Sizes:Twin, Full, Queen, King, Cal KingFill:Goose downWeight options:Summer, light, medium, ArcticWarranty:Limited lifetime warrantyCare:Machine-washable If you’re investing in a down comforter, go straight to the pros. This one takes it up a notch (and the loft), packing in ethically sourced, 850-plus fill power European white goose down. The higher fill power makes it extra insulating on frosty nights, amplified with a weight level like Arctic. “I used to switch between a hot and thick comforter during the winter and a light sheet during the summer, and I pretty immediately realized this was the only one I was gonna need year-round,” Joel Pavelski,GQ's global director of content strategy, says. The tightly woven cambric cotton shell keeps everything in place, while double-stitched piped edging and corner loops mean no annoying duvet shifting. “The distribution of the goose down is really spectacularly even, doesn't clump, even after washing the thing, which is pretty remarkable for a down comforter,” Pavelski says. “It's also just seriously cozy—feels like you just arrived in a nice hotel without the crisp, over-bleached feel of a nice hotel comforter.” Hypoallergenic and built to last, this is peak bedding performance. The Company Store The Company Store Sizes:Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, Cal KingFill:Duck downWeight options:Light, Medium, Extra, UltraWarranty:Lifetime guaranteeCare:Machine-washable Most down comforters stick to classic white, but The Company Store shakes things up with over 10 color options (think deep charcoal, rich merlot, and soft sage). It’s filled with 500-fill-power RDS-certified duck down, which keeps it in a more accessible price range without sacrificing comfort. While goose down tends to be loftier and more insulating, duck down still delivers plenty of warmth and softness, making this a solid pick for everyday use. It’s not the ultra-plush, high-fill luxury of top-tier options, but for a guest room, kid’s room, or just a reliable, well-made comforter, it more than holds its own. Plus, it comes in four different warmth levels, is backed by a lifetime guarantee, and clocks in at under $400. A smart, customizable pick from a brand that knows its bedding. Saatva Saatva Sizes:Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, Cal KingFill:Alternative fibers and natural lyocell fillWeight options:There’s a separate lightweight versionWarranty:1-year limited warrantyCare:Machine-washable Don’t overlook a down-alternative comforter, especially when it’s done right. They can be just as cozy, breathable, and generally lighter on the wallet. Saatva is known for its top-tier percale (a long-staple cotton that’s cool and soft to the touch), which is why it’s a regular on our “best of” lists (see: best sheets). The percale cotton shell keeps things breathable, while the blend of down-alternative fibers and moisture-wicking lyocell fill keeps you warm throughout the night. It’s hypoallergenic, thanks to its lack of real feathers, and its box quilting ensures the fill stays evenly spread. Bonus points for being machine-washable. Corner loops also make it easy to hook up to a duvet cover (if that’s your thing). Parachute Parachute Sizes:Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, Cal KingFill:European white down and feather fibersWeight options:Midweight, lightweightWarranty:5-year warrantyCare:Dry clean or machine wash cold A big name in luxury bedding, Parachute Home is the go-to for top-tier linens, pillows, and all things sleep. This down duvet insert (meaning itdoesneed a cover) is stuffed with RDS-certified 750-fill power European white down. It’s lofty and warm without weighing you down or trapping too much heat. The sateen shell is soft and smooth, and the baffle box construction keeps the fill evenly spread. Double-stitched seams add extra durability, which makes the steep price feel more justified. Puredown Puredown Amazon Sizes:Twin, Full, Queen, King, Oversized KingFill:Goose downWeight options:All-season, winterWarranty:30-night risk free trialCare:Dry clean only We can’t knock the convenience of the online juggernaut, especially when it stocks legit finds like this Puredown comforter. Packed with ethically sourced goose down, 800 fill power, and a buttery-soft 700 thread count cotton shell, it’s designed for peak coziness. The pinch-pleat detailing adds a little flair, while baffle box construction and corner tabs keep everything in place. There’s two color options (white and a charcoal-like grey) and a heavier weight option that’ll keep you nice and snug in the winter. The fluffy feel and high loft makes it feel like being tucked into a cloud (seriously, though). When you get the package on your doorstep, just give it a quick fluff or a low-temp tumble in the dryer for 10 minutes to let it fully expand. Buffy Buffy Sizes:Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, Cal KingFill:recycled plastic fillWeight options:NoneWarranty:Two-year protection plan, 50-night free returnsCare:Machine-wash cold You can rest easy under this comforter for two reasons: It’s cozy and good for the planet. True to the Buffy brand, this comforter is filled with down-alternative made from recycled plastic bottles—and yet, it still manages to deliver that signature fluff factor. High-end comforters can easily hit $300 or more, making this a standout, budget-friendly option. It’s hypoallergenic, machine-washable, and solid for all seasons. The 300-thread-count sateen weave lyocell shell absorbs moisture faster than cotton (great for those who run hot). All in all, it’s a win for both your bed and the environment. What’s the difference between a comforter and a duvet? It’s understandable why you’d get them confused, since they’re both thick, fluffy blankets. A duvet insert—which is what we’re referring to when we’re talking about a “duvet”—is intended to be used with a separate duvet cover, which you can wash separately and swap. A comforter is one-piece operation, where the cover's sewn on. They come in plenty of colors, prints, and patterns. But the whole all-in-one situations makes cleaning a true comforter that much harder, especially if the one you buy is spot-treat- or dry-clean-only. How long do down comforters last? If you're treating it right, the shelf life of a down comforter should last about 10 years or longer. Sometimes bedding companies will offer limited warranties to cover certain types of repairs, but make sure you check out the care tag for instructions. Breathability: A lot of people sleep hot, so you'll want to find a comforter that offers some sort of breathability so you're not trapping your body heat all night. Some people justneedto stay under the covers no matter how hot it may be, so having a breathable comforter will mean they don't wake up in a pool of their own sweat. Construction: Look for a comforter that has box stitching. which keeps the fill (down or a synthetic down) from just falling to the bottom of the comforter—but there are two types of box stitching. Nicer duvets use a baffle box construction, in which strips of fabric separate the chambers that hold the fill. This keeps the fill more evenly distributed (a.k.a., fluffy). Cheaper versions use sewn-through construction, where each chamber's edges are stitched together directly. They tend to be less fluffy, and likely won't last as long. Comfort: The best down comforters will feel soft and give you a cozy sleep at night whether it's hot, cold, or somewhere in-between. You'll probably want to find a comforter that has a satisfying fluffiness, something that feels good to be swaddled by for (hopefully) eight good hours of sleep. That, of course, will have to do with loft or fill, which will also dictate how warm or insulating your comforter will be. Finding the best down comforters or duvets takes some dedication and a whole lot of lounging. For starters, we picked brands we trust, ones that have earned their reputation in the sleep world with quality, solid certifications (especially when it comes to down), and high praise among consumers. We sifted through countless reviews and weighed all the factors: price, loft, fill power, cover material, overall feel, care (machine-washable or dry clean only), and warranty policies. After narrowing down our options, we put several to the ultimate test in the lab (a.k.a., our homes). Over the years, we curled up, napped, and flopped around, keeping detailed notes on what worked and what didn’t. This time around, we also added new comforters to the mix that deserve the hype. All of this to find the comforter or duvet that’ll keep you cozy, comfy, and ready for some serious shut-eye.",

    "article_text": "The bromance is officially underway. Just weeks after it was revealed that two of Hollywood’s buzziest leading men—Austin ButlerandJeremy Allen White—would be facing off inan upcoming A24 movie calledEnemies, the costars were spotted taking in a Cubs game together in Chicago, where the film is being produced. And as is their wont, both stars hit the Wrigley Field stands in complementary ensembles of well-worn, low-key staples. Butler, a knownworkwear aficionado, wore a sun-fadedchore coatover a cleanwhite teeandbeat-up khakis. White, meanwhile, rocked a fittedpolo shirttucked into some vintagejeans. All the soft tones of blue and tan worked a charm together. But the true key toboththeir fits were the truly excellent caps they sported up top. Neither actor opted toroot, root, root for the home teamwith their headwear. Instead, White threw on the same totally shredded New York Mets cap he’s been wearing for years (including inthis very magazine)—a testament to the joy of finding a signature item that works for you and then wearing it into the ground. Butler’s hat was less roughed up, but even more covetable: a rare vintage number from the Texas construction firm Capco Steel, complete with a throwback six-panel silhouette and rope detailing across the brim. Both caps felt perfectly dialed to their wearers’ understated looks. And with summer officially underway, it’s a good reminder that now—when having a little shade and sun protection at the ready is more important than ever—is the ideal time toget your hat game down pat. They don’t all have to be battered like White’s or niche like Butler’s, but the last thing you want is to get caught out in a hat that looks too unnaturally new or simply out of sync with the rest of your fit. And if your favorite cap happens to be in sync with yournew BFF’sfavorite cap? Well, that’s one hell of a bonus. This story originally appeared onBritish GQ.",

    "title": "Adam Friedland Could Be the Millennial Jon Stewart. But Does He Want That?",
    "article_text": "Only seconds into the podcast, Adam Friedland shat himself. It seeped through his white linen pants onto his red camping chair, leaving a “little puddle of diarrhea,” per cohostStavros Halkias, who spent the first minute after this happened guffawing like a hobgoblin. It’s a classic moment. But it’s not even the most ridiculous thing ever to happen onCum Town,Friedland and Halkias’s weekly podcast with Nick Mullen, which amassed a serious cult fanbase over the six years it ran. For a moment, they became superstars within the edgy progressive cohort known as the “dirtbag left,” though the boys on the pod seemed much more intrigued by penis jokes than politics. For a certain subset of nerds who love puerile slacker humor,Cum Townwas a parasocial obsession and the peak of comedy forever. “I don’t think we realized it, but I think it was the funniest podcast,” Friedland chuckles now, his glasses bobbing a little as he talks. We’re in the Flatiron studio where he’s been filmingThe Adam Friedland Show,a spiritual successor toCum Townwhose second season premieres this week. Wearing a Yankees cap, a greenish flannel, and denim, he proudly walks me through the floor. There’s a recording studio and a hallway that leads to an office and a second room that’ll feature in season two, packed with what appear to be old transistor radios and chunky TV sets from the ’60s. I ask if they’re authentic and he looks at me like I’m a moron. WhereCum Townwas “three late-20s—and then early-30s—men behaving like 11-year-olds,” as Friedland puts it,TAFStakes itself more seriously. It’s a flip of the talk show format, where Friedland provokes star guests likeJulian CasablancasandNeil deGrasse Tyson. The set is a re-creation of talk show legend Dick Cavett’s studio, with lush blue walls and leather seats. But instead of bulletins with notes about the Vietnam War,TAFS’s office wall has a corkboard festooned with the faces of the Nelk Boys, the massively popular YouTube prankstersbeloved by Donald Trump. Friedland is about to interview Nelk member Steiny, and he’s just come off a four-day research bender spent constructing FBI-style psychological profiles of the frat-bro influencers. He speaks about an in-video feud between Steiny and SteveWillDoIt like it was the Cuban Missile Crisis. Friedland has matched wits with plenty of content clowns like Steiny, but he’s also applied his wry approach to interviews with more sincere heads, such as the writer-activist Norman Finkelstein. That context collapse often produces the show’s funniest interactions, and he’s doing it more in season two, with guests like California Rep. Ro Khanna and the ex-congressman and prolific disgraced sexterAnthony Weiner, who’s staging a political comeback. After Trump won over Zoomers by working the podcast circuit, and liberals yearned for a “Joe Rogan of the Left,” Friedland suddenly found himself fielding interview offers from politicos willing to try anything in order to connect. While the show rarely veers explicitly into serious politics—substantive discussions are always undercut by Friedland doing a bit—the 38-year-old host has an innate knack for disarming even the most buttoned-up guests. So Friedland is now at a crossroads. Once a comic who set the internet ablaze because he called Chelsea Clinton ugly, he’s becoming the friedJon Stewartof his generation, someone who can meaningfully influence disaffected young people if he wants to. Friedland, a two-timeBernievoter and longtime progressive, was always into politics. He worked for his local congresswoman in high school, and vividly remembers her melting down on the day George W. Bush got reelected as president in 2004. He says he was bullied and called “gay” for liking politics: “In seventh grade I cried at school ’cause [Bush] stole the election.” In high school, he claims he staged a walkout in protest of the Iraq War, but only two women left with him. “People were like, ‘Losers!’” he recalls with a slight quiver. “Of course the goth girls are gonna walk out for the Iraq War. They don’t believe in anything.” Friedland mostly grew up in Las Vegas, but spent a couple of formative years in Cape Town, where his parents are from. There, he learned how to swim and worshiped Nelson Mandela. His family moved to the States because his father, an architect, faced mandatory conscription into the apartheid-era South African army, which had a role in the Angolan Civil War. Friedland thinks it’s utterly ridiculous that his countrymanElon Muskhas so much power now. “He drives me insane. How is there a South African guy in charge of America?” At George Washington University, Friedland initially wanted to go into politics, until he met the people who were actually running for office and found their personalities repellent. He started doing stand-up across the DC circuit, which is where he met Mullen and Halkias. His passion for the craft leaps out when he lists favorite shows and comedians. These include the Black stand-up ofDef Comedy JamandComicView, white Americans likeConan O’Brienand Stephen Colbert, and a whole bunch of Brits. He name-checks Ali G,Brass Eye, Alan Partridge,The Day Today, Chris Morris, and Armando Ianucci, the man behindVeepand its UK precursor, the foul-mouthed political comedyThe Thick of It.“Four naan, Jeremy,”he chirps when I mentionPeep Show.He theorizes that Brits are so good at bleak satire because of how they’ve been imperialistically cuckolded—a nation of “weird, pasty white guys” who used to own the world, now confined to their sad “gray island.” As Friedland tells it, the genesis ofCum Townsounds more like an accident than anything thought-out. The trio never prepared or rehearsed lines; they just shot the shit for an hour in Mullen’s living room. Friedland didn’t know podcasts could be profitable, and describes the experience of telling his dad about it as akin to a coming-out conversation: “He’s like, ‘What is the Cum Boys?’ I was like, ‘Dad, you know that project I told you I’ve been working on? This is what it is. It’s really good.’ And he was like, ‘Do you think a woman will ever marry a Cum Boy?’” O, ye of little faith—the Boys’ charismatic banter became a massive hit, eventually racking up so many Patreon subscribers that they were making over $100,000 a month. At the time, Friedland says they thought they “suuuucked.” He speaks about the podcast almost as if he blacked out for six years, with little memory of jokes or bits because he never listened back to the recordings. Only recently has he revisited the pod by watching some of the fan-madeCum Towncompilations on YouTube, which is one of the big reasons it reached so far, with diehards basically doing free clip-farm PR for them. The pod’s fan base is feverish, full of young men whose personalities were shaped by listening to the show every week as if it were appointment TV. On YouTube, people have made popular animations to go along with bits, such as the boys pretending to beMafia members with Down syndromeand imaginingJoe Biden as a Twitch streamer. The Reddit is a clown fiesta of ironic insanity, where the regulars include aguy who saysa monthlong cocaine-and-Ritalin binge pushed him to make an illegalCum Townmashup album that horrified his family. There are also normal posts where people share their favorite lines, including one person who coded anentire directorywhere people can search for their favoriteCum TownandTAFSbits. But the magic couldn’t last forever, andCum Towndissolved in 2022. Halkias, who had just released a comedy special and had been on the road for two years, had become exhausted and quit the show. So Mullen and Friedland launchedTAFSin 2022 partly as a joke, thinking it would be funny to make the self-deprecating nebbish guy the star of the show. They were initially clueless. Friedland says they didn’t know how cameras worked; he typedjournalisminto Google search to learn the basics of interviewing. But then, gradually, the jape became a job, a real one, something he took seriously and worked hard at. “I really could waste a day back in the pod days. I could crack three movies. Girlfriend comes home from work, tell her that I actually had a hard day too,” he says. “[TAFS] was genuinely maybe the first time I was like, ‘I’m going to try as hard as I can on something.’ Because it’s scary, right? It’s really scary to try. But what you find is that it’s way better to be trying and working hard than lazy.” Friedland puts a shit-ton of effort into the show now, scripting little skits that air before each conversation, including agenuinely artfulTaxi Driverparodythat played before his Paul Schrader interview. The team is small, and even smaller now that Mullen’s left the show to work on other projects. Friedland previously employed a young man who likedTravis Scottand woreChrome Heartsas a professional clip farmer—someone who posts highlights to social media—but has since let him go. Now it’s just him and a couple of writers and camera operators; for heavier-lift interviews, he preps with podcaster and journalist Noah Kulwin. His new fiancée, Maia Lafortezza, doesn’t work on the show but came in halfway through our interview with her friend, the writer Honor Levy. Lafortezza is armed with a massive bouquet of French tulips; there’s no vase or container big enough, so she puts them in a recycling bin. After she leaves, Friedland turns to me and says, “Did that seem contrived? If I did that, that’d be so psychotic.” In the bigger picture, Friedland andTAFSare still underground. His biggest claim to fame so far might be facilitating a conversation whereMatty Healy laughed at a racist jokeabout Ice Spice, which sparked national news headlines and made Swifties send Friedland death threats. He’s notorious in the local New York “edgelord” comedy space—friends with people likeAnoraactress Ivy Wolk and Peter Vack—and seems unconcerned with higher-level fame. But his profile is steadily rising as he reels in increasingly revered guests to the show. This season, in addition to the politicians, he sat down withSex and the City’s Sarah Jessica Parker, and former NBA playerBlake Griffin. He interviewed the music critic Anthony Fantano, whom he thinks he pissed off. “I got really mad at him. I was just like, ‘You can’t talk about the lyrics only. It’s about thesoul.’ I really went boomer mode on him.” He talks about interviewing like he’s solving a puzzle—there are specific juicy, substantive points he wants to reach with certain guests, but he often isn’t sure how to get there conversationally, so he has to subtly manipulate the discussion in that direction. For instance, when he interviewedChris Cuomo, the news anchor’s team told Friedland that he couldn’t ask about Cuomo’s lawsuit with CNN or his controversy-embroiled brother, Andrew. “So that was a cool project, ’cause you have a limit, so it’s like, ‘How do I broach those things? Even though I’m being told [no], ’cause I’m a bad boy. How do I break them rules?’ So you bring up the political family, and ‘Your dad’s the governor,’ and those things naturally come up.” But he’s not really trying tobreak news; he thinks comedy is ruined when you insert politics, aiming for “claps” instead of laughs. So when Cuomostarts opening upabout how his daughter resonates with the “empowerment principle” of Dua Lipa’s music, Friedland fucks up the vibe by murmuring that he’d let the singer “shit in my mouth if she wants to.” (He insists the show doesn’t have a scatological bent, but it’s definitely a motif.) A year after his interview with Cuomo—with whom Friedland might have had the most conversational rapport out of all his guests— they remain in touch. “We’re boys still. We text. Sometimes I harass him. When Biden hadn’t dropped out, I was like, ‘What the fuck is going on?’” I got to see Friedland’s problem-solving in action a week later when he interviewed Nelk crony Steiny. When I enter the studio on a lovely mid-May afternoon, everyone is buzzing. Producers are trying to rig a Happy Dad, Nelk’s seltzer brand, onto the rafters so they can pull it down like a freestyle mic. Friedland tells me he loves Dave Blunts’s voice and that he DM’d the rapper to ask him to make a cameo in his Sarah Jessica Parker interview for the hell of it. The team prepared more than usual for this one, thinking it would be cool if they took a B-tier Nelk Boy and went Nardwuar on his ass. I watch as Friedland switches on in live time, from chill prep mode to his signature look of cross-legged and quizzical (his physical comedy, the way he makes himself look bookish, is underrated). Friedland had spoken with Steiny’s sister, a longtime “Cum Girl,” and was ready to startle him with an insane amount of lore, like how he apparently lied to girls that he was an all-American quarterback named “Tommy Smith” and went to yo-yo summer camp. Halfway through, Friedland surprise-calls Steiny’s dad, one of the top defense attorneys in the US, and asks what he makes of his son associating with “people who are ushering in a new era of fascism.” Friedland opens up to Steiny’s dad, revealing that he lost his mother, and Steiny immediately interjects that he lost his mom too, for eight months (because he loves Trump). The convo started awkwardly, and Steiny clearly wondered if he was being set up, but Friedland disarmed him easily. He belittled himself to make his guest comfortable, then subtly poked with a scalpel, digging him into questions about facilitating Trump’s rise and whether Steiny, a Jewish man, regretted doing a show with Candace Owens. The entire time, Steiny sat there slumped over, wrapped in a hoodie, cracking Happy Dad after Happy Dad. During the recording, I couldn’t tell if Friedland was actually enjoying his company (he said the guests he expects to dislike, he usually ends up liking the most). But after Steiny dipped, it was pretty clear that everyone thought he was a schmuck, a prick who said unconscionable things. Friedland described the experience as a “schizophrenic episode” and says that he entered a “fugue state” at the end. Getting to turn the tables on Friedland, someone who plays with his guests like they’re cat toys, was a funny experience. He’s forthcoming but obviously not going to fall into any traps; he’s not a cold media-trained ghoul, but he’s not going to accidentally divulge anything he doesn’t want to. When I ask him about his ex-girlfriend Dasha Nekrasova, the cult cohost of the Red Scare podcast, who blew up as“Sailor Socialism”and now full-sends Trump, he rambles much like Steiny did when Friedland asked him something that made him uncomfortable. “I don’t know. It’s, people, people are, the phone is broken, people. I don’t know about Dasha. People are right-wing now? It blows my mind that people are right-wing now. I’ll say that…. I think [Red Scare’s influence on culture] is overstated.” Friedland seems allergic to pretense, the kind of guy who lets things glide off him and doesn’t want to be put on a pedestal for his ideas. When I ask him about music, since he used to run a DIY venue, he tells me about a particular subgenre he's been into lately, then asks for it to be taken off the record. In a roundabout way, he explains that he grew up abhorring the notion of hipsterdom, of trying to be cool by flexing esoteric taste. “I have a real aversion to it in adulthood: ‘Here’s this Swedish seven-inch that three people have heard.’ It’s just repulsive.” This leaks over into the way he talks about his own work. He says comedians think they’re geniuses like Noam Chomsky or Pablo Picasso nowadays, when they’re actually just “content creators.” He speaks about his show’s aims broadly—to entertain, to make people laugh and feel good, to be a remedy for a political and digital landscape that has “broken people’s brains.” “This is the most demoralized I’ve ever seen people,” he says. “Everyone’s just bummed out. In the ’90s, dude, when I was growing up, we were like, ‘This is the best year ever. And next year’s gonna be the best year ever.’ It was incredible. People were buying Hummers.” You could mistake the way he talks about his show for apolitical, irony-poisoned pussyfooting, but it’s really just a desire not to be didactic or sanctimonious. Friedland’s friend Brace Belden, a host of the leftist podcast TrueAnon, whose previous claims to fame include a voluntary tour of duty with a Kurdish militia during the Syrian civil war, tells me over the phone that Friedland does indeed have political convictions. While some might call him “the rudest person on Earth,” Belden says warmly, he’s actually “a great role model for people who have grown up in a pretty tough society, with either genetic or intellectual disabilities, that see somebody who resembles them on TV.” Belden doesn’t think Friedland would travel overseas to join a revolutionary socialist militia the way he did, but that that’s mostly because Friedland is smarter. “Despite his demeanor and general attitude, he does believe in things.” Belden met Friedland five or six years ago; he says they both dated Nekrasova at points. They now hang out a couple of times a week, sometimes at the Russian & Turkish Baths on Men’s Only night, which is known to be tactile and welcoming. Belden says he (and sometimes 20 other friends) receive constant unsolicited calls from Friedland, who loves talking on the phone. “It’s sort of one long, slow, humiliating experience as opposed to a sudden acute one,” Belden says of their friendship. “Every time we’ve hung out it’s basically been the equivalent of a guy shitting his pants a little bit. It’s getting full. He’s gotta wear those giant officer pants they wore in the 1910s now.” The last time they hung out, Belden went over to Friedland’s home in Brooklyn's Fort Greene neighborhood, where Friedland bragged about hisBob Dylanbootleg collection. Belden speaks about the show like it provides a borderline therapeutic or rehabilitative service for celebrities gone “spiritually or career-wise” awry. “It could be,” he suggests, “that Adam is so empty that your soul has to not only fill the vessel that contains it but part of his as well.” His pal was mostly just taking the piss, but it’s true that Friedland humanizes his guests. His goal is to create a platform that lets a demi-celeb like Chet Hanks—who mostly gets treated like a clown by other comics—show he’s a normal person. Or in Cuomo’s case, to make the “meathead Italian CNN guy” seem like just aguy.The internet, Friedland says, ”doesn’t make people feel that way, typically. It’s nice if you’ve registered that [humanizing], that makes me feel really good.” At worst, you could say he’s normwashing evil dudes like Steiny, but it feels more like he’s revealing their vapidity. Inspiring or unsavory as the guests are, his interviews catch them in a doofy yet vulnerable light. Unlike the many new-gen influencers who glaze Trump or treat their guests like a means for metrics, Friedland seems to possess morals that come from a life spent in leftist spaces, a kindness lurking beneath the abrasive surface. “I think Adam’s heart is mostly in the right place,” Belden says earnestly. “He works on this motherfucker more than most YouTubers do.” In the wake of Trump’s reelection, people have been scurrying to form a new left-liberal media ecosystem, from the sitting governor of California’s podcast,This Is Gavin Newsom,toDoomscrollhost Joshua Citarella, who featured Friedland in an episode and wrote apost openly declaringhis desire to build a new left-wing pipeline built on class consciousness. While Friedland would never make his aims so explicit—he’s too anti-scold for that—it’s easy to imagineTAFSbecoming a node in this hypothetical network. Who knows what will happen over the next few years: Maybe the pivot to pod will fail spectacularly, or maybe today’s emerging YouTube hosts will decide every future election. For now, he’s geeked thatTAFSis even a thing. His dad is finally impressed by his efforts, and no longer worries about his son living as a Cum Boy. He gets to troll celebrities for a career. “I’m the luckiest dickhead in the world,” he says, grinning. PRODUCTION CREDITS:Photographed byBobby DohertyGrooming byMelissa DeZarateat A-Frame Agency",

    "title": "HBO's Harry Potter Cast Is Coming Together. Here's Everything We Know",
    "article_text": "The newHarry Pottercast is taking shape, thirteen years after the final installment of the original film series. That's right—it's been almost a decade and a half sinceThe Deathly Hallows Pt. II, which is a pretty long time to go without a reboot for a franchise as huge asHarry Potter, not least in the age of rapacious IP exploitation. Yeah, sure, theFantastic Beastsmovies scratched an itch for the wannabe wizards of the world, and the triple-A video gameHogwarts Legacyprovided a veritable Floo Network for millions of Potterheads. But neither holds a magically floating candle to the O.G. films, right? So now comes an HBO TV series adapting the originalHarry Potternovels, which is expected to be epic in length, rolling out overthe course of a decade(or more). The film series made stars ofDaniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson andRupert Grint, and introduced a new generation of fans to beloved British and Irish character actors like Alan Rickman, Michael Gambon,Gary Oldman, Robbie Coltrane, and Imelda Staunton. There’s little doubt, then, that HBO’sHarry Potteris the hottest casting target for British talent this side ofGame of Thrones, even if enthusiasm for the project has been dampened byPottercreatorJ.K. Rowling's ongoing social-media crusade against trans rights. (HBO head Casey Bloys has described Rowling as “fairly involved” with the series’ development, while noting that her presence hasn't put anyone off signing up, perIndieWire.) Nevertheless, all involved have a formidable challenge on their hands. Can they live up to the beloved character portrayals that gave the movies their magic? We should know a year or so from now — the series is set to begin shooting this year with an anticipated debut on HBO Max in 2026. The latest big news for theHarry Pottercast? HBO have officially revealed the three child actors who'll be playing Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger. Casting is well underway, then. But who should get the wands, robes, and magic motorbike? For this exercise, think ofGQas the sorting hat, as we pick through the most eligible British actors to join HBO’s new Potterverse. HBO has announced the three child actors who'll take on the iconic roles of Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley in the upcoming series. As expected, all three actors are screen newcomers: Dominic McLaughlin will play Harry Potter, Arabella Stanton will be Hermione Granger, and Alastair Stout will take on the role of Ron Weasley. When we say “newcomers,\" we mean it—of the three, McLaughlin is the only one with an IMDb page (which aside fromPotter, lists only one other acting credit, in an upcoming Sky original movie about an ill-tempered pumpkin farmer.) “After an extraordinary search led by casting directors Lucy Bevan and Emily Brockmann, we are delighted to announce we have found our Harry, Hermione, and Ron,\" showrunner Francesca Gardiner and director Mark Mylod said in a statement. \"The talent of these three unique actors is wonderful to behold, and we cannot wait for the world to witness their magic together onscreen. We would like to thank all the tens of thousands of children who auditioned. It's been a real pleasure to discover the plethora of young talent out there.” Actor/comedian Nick Frost, a mainstay of Edgar Wright'sCornetto Trilogy, is confirmed for Hagrid. It's the perfect marriage of role and actor, as far as we're concerned: Hogwarts' very own BFG will allow Frost to play a less immediately comic part than we'd usually associate him with, while his own comedic instincts will surely bring out Hagrid's funnier side. At one point,Ted Lasso's Brett Goldstein was reportedly up for the role—which would have been a very different direction indeed. Nevertheless, HBO have confirmed that it'll be Frost on the magic motorbike. John Lithgow. Following months of speculation, HBO finally confirmed in mid-April that it'll be veteran actor John Lithgow as Dumbledore. Casting an American inPotter's second biggest role might come with its own dose of controversy for British fans, but lay down the torches for a moment. Nailing the British accent is nothing to an actor of Lithgow's caliber (recall his turn as Winston Churchill inThe Crown), and perhaps it's only fair that an American should take the role of one of modern fiction's most famous Englishmen for once, given how Britain's acting exports disproportionately dominate the small screen across the Atlantic. Besides which, Lithgow's many Emmys and Oscar nominations speak for themselves. Janet McTeer. It'll be Janet McTeer ofAlbert Nobbs,OzarkandThe Menuas McGonagall, the Hogwarts matriarch played by the late, great Maggie Smith in the films. Smith is another tough example to live up to, but McTeer certainly has the talent and look. HBO's confirmation came in mid-April after months of speculation; names previously circulated for the role included Sharon Horgan (ofBad Sisters). Paapa Essiedu. I May Destroy YouandThe Lazarus Project's Paapa Essiedu has been officially announced as the next Snape. His star has rapidly risen in recent years, with roles inGangs of London, Saoirse Ronan's filmThe Outrun, and a standout turn inBlack Mirrorserving to cement his screen bonafides. Expect hisHarry Potterpart to shoot him into the A-list stratosphere—andwe have no doubthe'll match up to the might of Alan Rickman. Screen newcomer Luke Thallon, the 29-year-old actor fresh off his acclaimed run as Hamlet for the Royal Shakespeare Company, has been cast as Professor Quirrell. Notably, it's his first major screen credit; could we see him take the reigns as Voldemort later down the line, too? Another astute casting comes in the form of British comedy legend Paul Whitehouse as Filch. TheFast Showstar might be a surprising pick for Filch, Hogwart's ill-tempered muggle cleaner, but maybe that's the point—HBO appears to be leaning into comedy with thisHarry Pottercast, and Whitehouse might help file off Filch's rough edges. Take this one with a real pinch of salt, but theDaily Mailreportsthat O.G. Draco actor Tom Felton is the only actor from the original film cast being considered by HBO and J.K. Rowling for involvement in the reboot series. While the article notes long-standing fan interest in seeing Felton return as Draco's father Lucius, who was portrayed byJason Isaacsin the movies, the author suggests that “this is unlikely,” because “the showrunners want to use him in other ways.” TheMail's source is quoted as saying that, rather than being part of the primary cast, Felton could be deployed in a number of ways behind the scenes. “There has even been talk of getting him involved in creating behind-the-scenes content for HBO which could form part of a documentary about the making of the TV show,” the source said. How else could he appear?Fans on Redditsuggest that he could make for a good narrator, for one, and don't write off a background appearance. Cillian Murphy. You need a serpentine, slippery fellow for He Who Must Not Be Named—the sort of actor whose very presence can feel terrifying. (It also helps if you can picture them taking on the look of Munch’s The Scream after a few hours of prosthetics and make-up.) The obvious pick, if his recent Oscar win hasn’t taken him out of the running, would beCillian Murphy, whose sharp, spooky angularity just feelsrightfor old Vold. In April, Warner Bros TV head Channing Dungey told Deadline “I have no comment, no comment, no comment” when asked if Murphy was in the running for Dumbledore, an answer that only stoked this fire. She did say that they were “still weighing a couple of different options there,” however. For a younger pick, we'd suggest the HBOPotterbosses look no further thanStranger Things’Jamie Campbell Bower, whose villainous Vecna is as gross and spine-chillingly malignant as you’d ever want Voldemort to be. He did play the young version of another evil wizard, Grindelwald, in thePotterfilm universe. But does that really matter? Kit Harington. He's unhinged, erratic, and just a little bit disheveled—but, crucially, kind of endearing. The Sirius Black formula is a tough one to crack. Do you go the Gary Oldman route and recruit an actor you can reliably expect to perform to the back of the hall, or go for someone who will offer a subtler approach to Black's inner turmoil? Either way,Kit Haringtonwould be our first choice: he's a range-y performer who fits the age profile, can play to both Black's light and shade, and he just seems like he'd be a cool godfather. A word here, too, for fellowGame of ThronesalumnusRichard Madden, who carries many of the same qualities, though we'd expect a more introspective version of Black from him. Some fringe shouts could beBenedict Cumberbatch, although he's on the upper end of the likely age range. And could fellow MCU actorTom Hiddlestoninject Black with a little of Loki's mania? He certainly seems the right fit from the A-list Hollywood crop—and it's worth noting that, at 43, he's around the same age as Oldman when he shotPrisoner of Azkaban, give or take a few years. Mia Goth. The way that we imagine Bellatrix is so specific to Helena Bonham Carter that it'll be an uphill battle for anyone who is called upon to bring their own interpretation to the role—but such is the case for most of this cast. To our mind, the standout nominee would beMia Goth, the scream queen whose turn in 2022'sPearlwas considered Oscar-worthy enough for commentators to question why another performance in a horror film had been snubbed after she missed out on a nomination. Her knack for playing women on the edge would serve Bellatrix well. Phoebe Waller-Bridge. One of the hottest casting rumors around HBO'sPotterproject is thatPhoebe Waller-Bridgehas been offered the role of Harry's pompous Aunt Petunia, played by Irish acting legend Fiona Shaw in the original film series. (This tip also comes from the insiderDanielRPK.) At 39, Waller-Bridge is about the right age, and it should also be said that she has a similar look to Shaw. Plus, there was always a campy humor to Petunia—almost drag-like with her rich red lipstick, Marge Simpson pearls and cartoonish Thatcher scowl—that you could see theFleabagcreator tapping into with great success. But who might be her Vernon? Give it toMatt Berry, who would surely make the most delicious opera out of line reads like “No post on Sundays—ha!” This post originally appeared inBritish GQ.",

    "title": "How They Pulled Off Those Stunts in Mission: Impossible—Final Reckoning",
    "article_text": "When it comestime to start a newMission: Impossiblemovie, the first thing that happens is Tom Cruise, the star of the franchise, and Christopher McQuarrie, its longtime writer-director, sit down together and they ask each other:What do you want to do?The answer is inevitably: something difficult and dangerous. Years ago, when Cruise and McQuarrie were beginning to sketch out the plot of 2018’sMission: Impossible—Fallout,Cruise proposed a helicopter chase: his character in the films, Ethan Hunt, pursuing a bad guy, played by Henry Cavill, while both of them were aloft. As a rule, inMission: Impossible,stunts are real: meaning they are performed by the actual actors involved, at least when possible, and when they are being done by Tom Cruise, that means all the time. “He’s the only actor in the world who is actually going to do everything,” Fraser Taggart, the series’s director of photography, told me. In theMission: Impossiblefranchise alone, Cruise has climbed the shiny glass sides of the Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building; hung from the side of an A400 military transport plane as it took off; and ridden an actual motorcycle off the edge of an actual Norwegian cliff. He has a commercial pilot license. He is one of 36 people in history to be named an honorary US naval aviator. He can parachute and BASE jump and free dive. But one issue with this particular idea forFalloutwas that Cruise, at the time, was not trained as a helicopter pilot. So Cruise and McQuarrie made inquiries, and they were told that at eight hours a day, seven days a week, it would take three months to get Cruise up to speed. Cruise asked: What about the other 16 hours in a day? A month and a half later, he was ready to fly. The second problem with the idea was that it was so perilous that most countries wouldn’t allowMission: Impossibleto try it within their borders. This is the next conversation McQuarrie and Cruise have. “You’ve got to figure out: Where in the world are we going to shoot this?” McQuarrie said recently. “Well, we’re going to go (a) where Bond isn’t. And (b) whereFast and Furiousisn’t. And (c) whereMissionhas never been. That Venn diagram says: Here’s where you’re shooting. Provided the State Department even allows you to go there.” With the helicopters, McQuarrie and Cruise tried India first, but “when we told them what we were going to do,” McQuarrie said, “they were like, That’s not happening here.” Finally, they found a friendly government in New Zealand, which said, according to McQuarrie: “Shoot it away from population, and just know if you fly in this glacier and anything happens, there’s no one that can come and get you. You’ll be there forever. They’re going to fly over it and drop a plaque.” With the location secured, McQuarrie and Cruise got to work. In the sequence they’d planned, Hunt is pursuing a turncoat named Walker, played by Cavill, who is holding the detonator to two nuclear bombs. To film the chase, McQuarrie and his cameraman followed Cruise in a second helicopter. Once in the air, the production followed a strict fuel countdown, meaning they only had so much time in the sky, but the shot was tricky to get right. McQuarrie, over the radio, would give Cruise direction:left pedal, right pedal,until Cruise had flown himself into the frame. “Tom is lining up the helicopter in a camera he can’t see,” McQuarrie recalled. “And I said, ‘That’s your mark. Maintain it.’ The reason it’s always in the frame is because Tom Cruise is both flying the helicopter, looking over his shoulder so the camera can see him, and acting. He’s doing all of that at the same time.” McQuarrie and Cruise on the set ofThe Final Reckoning. Simon Pegg, who plays Benji Dunn, a member of the IMF, or Impossible Mission Force, in the series, told me he often feels “a sense of quiet dread” when the production is away attempting one of these sequences. For this one, Pegg said, “I remember when we said goodbye and Tom was going off to do all this stuff with Henry, I said, ‘See you in London. Or maybe not.’ ” McQuarrie and Cruise have now been working together for nearly two decades, beginning with 2008’sValkyrie,which McQuarrie wrote and produced, and Cruise starred in. Their partnership has become one of the most productive and lucrative in Hollywood history. And at its center isMission,as everyone involved calls it—a franchise unlike any other. Based on the TV series from the 1960s, the basic ingredients are almost camp: Each time out, Ethan needs a mission, which will be relayed via a self-destructing device. At some point, someone will wear a latex mask of a face that is not their own. The plots will be baroque; the exposition will come in 40-foot waves. And yet in its sheer scale, its locations, its dedication to practical effects, and most of all its star,Missionis unmatched. Since McQuarrie came aboard—first as an uncredited screenwriter on the 2011Mission: ImpossibleinstallmentGhost Protocol—the series has also distinguished itself as the rare action franchise about, for lack of a better word, adults. One unofficial rule ofMissionis that Ethan Hunt can’twantto do any of the insane things he has to do (ride a motorcycle off a cliff, hang off the side of a plane in midair, etc.), because what normal, mature person would? The primary emotions Hunt seems to feel are guilt, grief, and fear. Just like the rest of us. McQuarrie on set. To these movies, McQuarrie brings a unique and singular skill set: screenwriter (he won an Oscar, at age 26, for the second Hollywood film he ever wrote,The Usual Suspects), producer, star-handler, director, fixer, stuntman. The producer Jerry Bruckheimer, who worked with McQuarrie onTop Gun: Maverick,told me: “When you look at the town, there are maybe 10 really gifted writers, and maybe 10 really gifted directors, that you can rely on to make something that the audience is going to love.” McQuarrie is on both lists. And though he tries not to talk about it much, he is also on a third list, as the guy you call when your movie, or your script, isn’t working but the train has left the station and the film is already in production. Sometimes he is credited for this work—as onEdge of TomorroworTop Gun: Maverick—and sometimes, as onWorld War Z,orRogue One,he is not, which suits him fine. For the one sequence inFalloutwith the helicopters—a scene that would ultimately run around 12 minutes in the film—they shot about 80 hours of footage,Mission’s editor, Eddie Hamilton, told me.Eighty hours.While director and actor hovered in the air. In a canyon where if something went wrong, there would be no escape. “If you want to know why I’m working for Tom for 18 years and other people aren’t,” McQuarrie said, “lots of directors will do that once. They don’teverwant to fucking do that again.” One day recently,McQuarrie was at home in London, where he lives in a two-story apartment near Hyde Park, racing to finish the latest and possibly last installment of the franchise,Mission: Impossible—The Final Reckoning.(McQuarrie and Cruise both remain coy about whether this is, in fact, the finalMissionfilm.) It was a warm, quiet Saturday, and McQuarrie and Hamilton, his editor, were ensconced in an editing bay on the second floor of the apartment, working through the latest version of the iconicThis message will self-destructbrief that more or less begins eachMissionmovie. McQuarrie, who is called McQ by his friends, has an emphatic gray sweep of hair, clear-framed glasses, and the distinct and easily legible features of an iPhone emoji. He gestured at the scene on the monitors in front of him and Hamilton. “It’s a giant exposition dump,” he said. “And it’s always excruciating because information is the death of emotion.”Missionmovies tend to be dense with plot that even the films’ creators don’t expect the viewer to fully retain. “I’m acutely aware of what I think you are and are not listening to,” McQuarrie told me. “I actually don’t rely on you to pay full attention. I kind of rely on you to drift in and out and get key things.” McQuarrie began as a screenwriter: worshipful and intensely protective of the words on the page. But in time, and “as I started to understand my job as a director more, I started to understand, you got to let go of the word,” he said.Missionis made for massive global audiences. “Tom and I are talking all the time about the fact that every word you write is a word someone has to read in some part of the world. And that when they’re reading the subtitles, they’re actually not seeing the image. So my images have to tell the story and the words become music.” McQuarrie had Hamilton cue up the sequence from the beginning and play it for me. “Good evening, Ethan,” intoned Angela Bassett, who plays the president of the United States in the film. Cruise silently watched a monitor as Bassett laid out his character’s history, where Hunt was now, and the stakes of his latest mission. Montages of destruction, nuclear warheads, scenes from pastMissions played on the screen. “We’re motivating cuts based on specific words,” McQuarrie explained. “So even if you’ve tuned out, when you hearsacrifice,you might tune in for key words.” The studio, Paramount, had recently screenedMission: Impossible—The Final Reckoningfor a test audience in Paramus, New Jersey, a location chosen as a literal and cultural midpoint between London and Los Angeles. McQuarrie—unlike many directors, who fear getting feedback that might lead to the studio mandating changes to their film—loves a test screening. “Filmmakers are terrified,” he said, “and rightly so, because not all filmmakers have control of their movie.” But Cruise, who is also the lead producer on theMission: Impossiblefranchise, has final cut. So they welcome the information, which they are then able to respond to as they see fit. In this case, audiences had been slightly confused by the mission brief, and so McQuarrie and Hamilton were trying to slow it down and leave them with the desired impression. McQuarrie and Cruise on the set ofDead Reckoning. After McQuarrie played the sequence once for me, he turned and asked: “What did you take from what you just watched?” I stammered out what I understood: “Artificial intelligence is trying to use nuclear stockpiles to destroy—” McQuarrie gently cut me off. “Thanks. That’s all I need you to retain.” Hamilton cued the scene again and they began going frame by frame, trying to make sure that the images were doing what they could not rely on the words to do. At one point, on a close-up of Cruise, McQuarrie asked Hamilton to pause the scene. “I don’t feel like he’s listening,” McQuarrie said, studying Cruise’s face. “I feel like he’s drifting.” Hamilton, on another monitor, called up more footage from the scene. “So here now we enter the library of Tom Cruise’s reactions,” McQuarrie said. When this was originally shot, McQuarrie said, Cruise was listening to something else entirely. “It was completely different,” he said. “What we’ll do is, the camera will just drift and Tom will just interact with the camera. And he’ll give you this library of options because he knows full well it’s probably all going to get rewritten.” Missionscripts are notorious for changing. “Tom likes to feel the film evolve, rather than have a set script and a schedule locked in,” Pegg told me. “It’s a very meta experience,” Erik Jendresen, who cowrote the last two, said. “Because as the screenwriter, me and Tom and Chris, we’re like the IMF team. We’re working under a ticking clock. The stakes couldn’t be any higher. And you’re needing to pivot constantly.” McQuarrie is sensitive to the impression this can leave. “We are not making it up as we go along,” he said. “But we are constantly pushing ourselves to make it better, to make it more immersive, more resonant, more engaging. We don’t trust that just because somebody says these lines on a piece of paper that you’re going to feel those things.” But a lot can change in the pursuit of a feeling. One of the first things McQuarrie did when he joined the franchise, mid-production, onGhost Protocol,was rewrite the entire backstory of a character named William Brandt, played by Jeremy Renner. The actor, who had already shot many of his scenes, was initially furious, according to McQuarrie. “Renner was saying, ‘I’m going to free-fall.’ He said to me, ‘But wait, I’ve been playing this whole other character.’ And I said, ‘But I watched all your dailies and all the emotions are the same. What motivated you in that scene doesn’t matter. The emotions you’re communicating are what matters.’ ” Actors get used to it, McQuarrie said, but the learning curve can be harsh. “Once you start to see the results—Vanessa Kirby onFallout,Rebecca Ferguson onRogue Nation,they were all new to the process, and they were all in some way quite understandably destabilized,” McQuarrie said. “But then they see the beginning, middle, and an end. So when they come back for another movie, by the time Vanessa came back forDead Reckoning,everything changed one day; we had an idea, we rewrote the scene that morning, and I said, ‘Look, I’m sorry, but you’ve got this big thing now.’ And she goes, ‘It’sMission.I totally get it.’ ” Hayley Atwell, who joined the franchise onDead Reckoning,told me that the “ever-changing, ever-expanding challenges” of doing things this way used the same muscles that she’d built, not in other movies, but in live theater. Because of the constantly evolving nature of theMissionscripts, they usually shoot exposition in places they can return to—and not, for instance, on the top of a mountain. “Anytime you have big information scenes, anytime you have exposition, plot, you put them in small rooms, cars, phone booth, you put ’em into a place that you can easily repeat and go back to,” McQuarrie said, “because you’re always going to be changing the plot to accommodate the emotion, rather than the other way around.” In the edit bay at McQuarrie’s home, Cruise’s face filled the screen in mid close-up, eyes darting, brow furrowing, head bobbing. Cruise is famous onMissionsets for knowing exactly where the frame is: He can indicate the top and bottom of a shot from 30 feet away. “See these very subtle movements he gives,” McQuarrie said. “He’s not doing a big thing. He knows the focal length of that lens and how much it picks up.” When a new actor joins theMission: Impossiblefranchise, one of the first things McQuarrie does is sit them down and talk to them about lenses. “Now, when I’m directing Hayley Atwell,” McQuarrie said, “I don’t say, ‘I want your character to feel this, that, and the other thing.’ I point to the lens and say: ‘It’s a 75-millimeter.’ ” Hamilton and McQuarrie started the scene again from the top. A few minutes later, McQuarrie’s phone rang and the lettersTCappeared on the screen. “I’ll be back,\u0000” he said. BeforeMission: Impossible,before Tom Cruise, before he won a screenwriting Oscar at 26, McQuarrie was a security guard at a movie theater. “That was my film school,” he said. “I spent four years watching the audience. They were my focus group.” McQuarrie grew up in New Jersey and went to high school with the actor Ethan Hawke, the director Bryan Singer, and the musician James Murphy, of LCD Soundsystem. Because of this, a career in the arts never seemed all that far-fetched. “Bryan was always making movies. James was always making music. When Ethan got cast inExplorers,I was 14, Bryan was 16. James was 12. That made it real—that made it something that could happen. And frankly, it was more real to me than going to college.” It was Singer who gave McQuarrie his first break in Hollywood when he commissioned McQuarrie to write what would become Singer’s first film,Public Access,in 1993. At the time, McQuarrie, who never did go to college, was doing odd jobs.Public Accessscreened at the Sundance Film Festival, and won a prize there, but the film never found a distributor. Then McQuarrie came back to Singer with an idea of his own, for a movie calledThe Usual Suspects,a film told primarily through the interrogation of a small-time criminal named Verbal Kint, played by Kevin Spacey, whose increasingly convoluted tale turns out to be—unbeknownst to his interrogator and the audience—an elaborate fiction. McQuarrie wrote the first draft ofThe Usual Suspectsin two weeks. The movie has an unorthodox structure; the film opens on the ending of the B-plot, about a group of criminals who are forced together to do a job, and then basically plays in reverse to hide the ending of the A-plot, the true identity of Verbal Kint, which is revealed in the film’s final frames. The end is the beginning is the end. “Suspectsis pure structure, pure dialogue,” McQuarrie said. “It’s pure screenplay.Suspectsis the rare example of a screenplay that is both readable and shootable. It’s also a script everyone in Hollywood passed on.Everyone.And it’s quite a fluke that the movie ever got made.” There is an aphorism McQuarrie is fond of: “Writing is pushing a boulder up a mountain. Directing is running down the mountain with the boulder rolling after you.” In the decade after winning the best original screenplay Oscar forThe Usual Suspects,he did a lot of pushing. “I thought the Oscar represented power that I could now make something that I wanted to make,” McQuarrie told me. “That wasn’t true. What it meant was I could get paid more money to write the moviestheywanted. Nobody wanted my movies.” McQuarrie had big ambitions and scripts of his own. But what he was actually doing was either joining ailing productions to help fix their scripts, or working in studio development, meaning he was being brought in to come up with ideas and treatments for projects conceived of by executives at various studios and production companies. In practice, very little of it ever saw the light of day. “I spent 10 years writing movies that were never going to get made,” McQuarrie said, “to finance the development of my scripts, which no one would ever make.” McQuarrie first joinedMission: Impossibleas an uncredited writer on 2011’sGhost Protocol. In 2000, frustrated with his inability to make something of his own, McQuarrie wrote another crime film,The Way of the Gun,with plans to direct it, with Ryan Phillipe andSuspectsactor Benicio Del Toro as his two leads.The Way of the Gun—about two bumbling criminals who abduct a surrogate mother and hold her and her unborn child for ransom—was deliberately antagonistic: It broke all the rules that McQuarrie had been forced to follow about sympathetic characters, about plot development, and about taking care of the audience, and when it came out, audiences summarily rejected it. “I directed an eight-and-a-half-million-dollar movie that I didn’t want to make,” McQuarrie said. “But it was my only opportunity. And I made it with both middle fingers extended, and the movie didn’t work, and the business said, ‘Thanks very much, that was your shot.’ And I was in director jail, and that’s where I remained for 12 years.” While in director jail, McQuarrie worked on many movies, and was fired off of many movies. Screenwriting is a brutal business. “Writers, consciously or unconsciously, we are held in contempt,” McQuarrie said. “The movie can’t happen without us, but we are not why a movie happens. We’re not stars, we’re not directors. We’re the nerd at the party and we have the car. You’re not getting home without us. That breeds a kind of resentment.” McQuarrie even went so far as to quit the business at one point. But he was also developing a reputation as a troubleshooter and a fixer. (McQuarrie was once asked to write a script about the making of the Transcontinental Railroad, but for cheap, meaning, somehow, it would need to be shot inside, without showing all that much of the actual railroad—“And I figured out how to do it.”) McQuarrie, Pegg told me, “thrives with a problem. I think McQ loves a crisis more than he loves a blank page.” What McQuarrie saw during his years in the wilderness were men and women—screenwriters, directors, producers—under duress, making unwise decisions, particularly on movies on the scale ofMission: Impossible.“A lot of these big tentpole movies,” McQuarrie told me, “how they work is you take a director who’s only made smaller films but has had success, and somebody does the math that says, ‘Hey, that person made a $5 million movie that made $50 million, now let’s give them $200 and they’ll make a billion.’ That’s actually not how it works. Because that person is leaping from an independent mindset into a massive commercial mindset without having had any education of the kind of movie they have to make at that number.” McQuarrie began to notice patterns. Mistakes that were made, over and over again. Studios soon recognized this particular talent. Once, McQuarrie told me, in his capacity as a movie ER doctor, he was parachuted in on two separate films in distress, on which two totally different filmmakers both had anApocalypse Nowposter in their office. “And I said, ‘Let me tell you how to makeApocalypse Now.Let me help you because it’s so simple. First, makeThe Godfather,then makeThe Conversation,then makeThe Godfather Part II.Then take all of your personal capital and all of your professional capital and gamble that and your marriage and the life of your leading man and your sanity on a movie about a war that nobody wants to remember. And then spend years shooting it and put it in cinemas and no one will come and it will take decades before people recognize what it is. That’s how you makeApocalypse.Now let me tell you something: You’re not makingApocalypse Now.’ ” What McQuarrie would try to do instead was identify whatever the filmmaker had done that was unique to the genre or the franchise they were working on. Something that was their signature. And he would say, “ ‘That’s your stamp. Now you’ve got to make a billion dollars. Come with me if you want to live.’ And in both cases the directors did not listen. And in both cases the films were taken away from them. Other filmmakers came in and finished those films.” McQuarrie didn’t blame the directors. He blamed the system. “The problem is that they were given an opportunity, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” McQuarrie said, “before anybody sat down and educated them and said, ‘Listen, before you do this, here’s the reality of making movies like this. Are you sure you want to do it?’ And that’s what doesn’t happen. There’s not a system that educates those people.’ ” McQuarrie knows this because hewasone of those people. What changed that fact—and what got McQuarrie out of director jail and development hell—was Tom Cruise. McQuarrie and Cruise met in 2006, as Cruise was circling the lead role inValkyrie,a movie about the failed assassination of Hitler that McQuarrie had written with the hope of being able to direct it. But Hollywood can be unforgiving. Singer, McQuarrie’s old classmate and collaborator, was also interested in directing the film, and so Singer—a more proven and financially successful filmmaker—became the director instead. (Singer has been accused of sexual assault in multiple lawsuits that were either settled or dismissed, and has maintained his innocence. He hasn’t directed a film since 2018. “My relationship with Bryan is pretty complex,” McQuarrie told me.) Cruise, according to McQuarrie, had two stipulations regardingValkyrie.The first was that they spend more money on the film. “He said, ‘Guys, you’re blowing up the 10th Panzer division in the first 10 minutes of your movie; you need more money.’ And I said, ‘What’s the compromise?’ And Tom said, ‘There is no compromise. We’re making this movie. We’re going to make it for the widest audience possible. We’re going to make the most emotional version of this movie that we can.’ ” The second stipulation was that McQuarrie, whom Cruise was growing to like and trust, joinValkyrieas a producer—a job he’d never done before. McQuarrie said yes anyway. “I went to work every day fully expecting to be fired,” he told me. He and Cruise are still working together 18 years later. “And it’s very important to point out that in betweenThe Usual Suspectsin ’95 andValkyriein 2006, a stack of movies this high, projects that I was called into rewrite, movies that never got made, not one piece of wisdom or applicable knowledge ever came from anyone in any of those meetings, ever,” McQuarrie said. “The truth of the matter is, other than what I brought to storytelling when I wroteThe Usual Suspects,everything I learned about movies I learned by making movies with Tom.” AfterValkyrie,McQuarrie’s career was reborn. Suddenly, he was being brought on to write or help fix movies that were actually being produced:Edge of Tomorrow, World War Z, The Tourist, Rogue One, Top Gun: Maverick.In 2012, he directed Cruise inJack Reacher;three years later, on the heels of doing the uncredited rewrite onMission: Impossible—Ghost Protocol,McQuarrie became the director of 2015’sMission: Impossible—Rogue Nation,after Cruise called the head of the studio and said that’s who he wanted in the chair. Jerry Bruckheimer told me the secret to McQuarrie’s success in the latter half of his career was simple: “It’s because he loves it. He loves entertaining audiences. He loves big movies. You’ve got to love it. You bring in certain writers who want to write a big movie but don’t really care about it, you know, or understand what it is. They’re guessing.” McQuarrie is not guessing. In London, over dinner,I asked McQuarrie to walk me through the making of a single stunt in the newestMission: Impossiblefilm. InFinal Reckoningthere is a sequence in which Cruise hangs from the side of a biplane, before leaping onto a second biplane, all in midair. An image from this scene is on the poster; pieces of it are in the film’s trailer. (This is the core of theMissionappeal: The thing the filmmakers care about most is the thing audiences care about most too. The movie is the marketing; the marketing is the movie.) The practice of going out onto the wing of a flying airplane is called wing walking, and that is who Cruise went to first: some wing walkers. “They said, ‘What do you want to do?’ ” McQuarrie told me. “And Tom said, ‘I want to be between the wings of the plane holding on to the tension wires, and I want to be in zero G between the wings.’ And wing walkers who do this for living said, ‘That will never happen. You can never do that.’ And Tom said, ‘All right, well, thank you very much for your time.’ ” And he and McQuarrie went and found some different wing walkers. During the reporting of this article, I heard stories like this a lot. (Okay, one more: During the shooting ofFallout, McQuarrie told me, Cruise broke his ankle. “A doctor, a sports specialist, said to Tom, ‘It will be six months before you can walk. It’ll be nine months before you can run, if you ever run again.’ And Tom’s response was, ‘I don’t have time for that. I’ve got six weeks.’ And six weeks later, he was climbing Pulpit Rock on a shattered talus bone.”) If you’re wondering what Cruise has to say about all this, so was I. In time, I was invited to ask him a few questions via email.What makesMission: Impossible…Mission: Impossible?,I wrote to him.Is it the process? The protagonist? The controlled chaos of the production? The stunts? The locations? The scale?“Dear Zach,” Cruise wrote back. “I don’t quite know how to answer this. Maybe it is all of these things and more.” Mary Boulding,Mission’s first assistant director, told me Cruise has a saying on set: “Don’t be careful. Be competent.” So what the production did next, for the biplane sequence, was start building the stunt, piece by piece. They started with: Just get Cruise out on the wing. How far out could he get? How many G’s could he take once he was out there? “Now there’s a moment,” McQuarrie said, “where Tom’s laying across a cable and the plane goes into positive G’s, which means your whole body is being forced earthward. He’s laying on top of a cable, which means his organs are being pushed past either side of the cable. And if you go too far, the cable’s just going to cut you in half.” It was at this point that I asked McQuarrie where his heart and mind typically were while shooting sequences like this one. During the A400 stunt, years ago, McQuarrie would sometimes black out from the stress as they waited to attempt it, he said. “If you want the summary, you’re the frog in the pan of water,” he told me. “You don’t realize the water’s boiling until you’re in it and it’s boiling. At which point you better figure out how to survive in boiling water or somebody’s going to be eating your legs and you develop a very thick skin.” They decided to shoot the biplane sequence in South Africa, just after the rainy season there, because the land would be abundantly green. That also meant it was cold. “If the temperature changes two degrees Celsius, Tom will be hypothermic after 12 minutes on the wing,” McQuarrie said. Cruise had no radio in his ear. So he and McQuarrie, who shot the sequence from a helicopter that hovered so close to the plane that McQuarrie could read Cruise’s airspeed in the cockpit, devised a set of hand signals. “The wind is hitting him not only at the speed that the plane is flying but the wind coming off the propeller. It’s hitting him at well over a hundred-plus miles an hour.” At that speed, air is actually hard to breathe. “There were times when Tom would have to lay down on the wing to rest between takes,” McQuarrie said. “You can’t tell if he’s conscious or not. And unless Tom pats the top of his head”—their hand signal for stop —“it’s like, keep rolling.” Cruise’s plane was also flying frighteningly low, McQuarrie said. “A plane flying at altitude, safely, is the most boring thing imaginable. You watchTop Gun: Maverick,the reason why we’re flying in that canyon, the reason whyStar Warsflies in that canyon—planes are only cool when they’re flying low. No matter how fast they’re flying. Now inTop Gun,they were flying, at times, 50, 60 feet off the deck. When you’re in a biplane that can’t go Mach 2, you’ve got to go lower. The margin of error is zero. The power on these planes, they’re at full throttle, which means if there’s a downdraft or a thermal, there is no more oomph to get up. You go down and that’s it. I’m directly behind it. He goes down, I go down. Our crew goes down.” In this way, over the years, McQuarrie has become kind of a stuntman too. Where Cruise goes, McQuarrie goes. Even in midair. “There is not enough room in this article for me to fully communicate and give justice to all of the things that Christopher McQuarrie is, does, and has done,” Cruise told me. Despite the danger, McQuarrie seems to love the chaos of the life he’s fallen into. The bad luck, the broken bones, the close calls. “It’s weird how the content of these things mirrors the making of them,” Jendresen, the screenwriter, told me. McQuarrie encouraged me to rewatch the last scene ofMission: Impossible—Fallout,which they’d shot on film. Cruise’s Ethan Hunt, after his helicopter ordeal, awakens to find all his friends around his hospital bed. His whole body is in pain. “Don’t make me laugh,” he says, and then there is a flash of light, and the screen goes dark. Cue theMissiontheme. But that flash was not planned, McQuarrie told me. What you’re seeing is the most basic accident you can see on a film set. “There is nothing moreMission,” McQuarrie said, grinning, “than the camera rolling out of film on the last shot.” Zach BaronisGQ’s senior special projects editor.

If you livein New York or California, you might not know that a war on porn is underway. Porn seemsas ubiquitous as ever, and almost too easy to consume—millions of videos are just a swipe or a click away. But in approximately half the country, you can’t access Pornhub, the most popular adult platform. The Canadian company has pulled out of Florida, Virginia, Texas, and 14 other states in recent years, after laws passed there requiring viewers to show government identification before entering. The purported intention of these laws is to stop minors from viewing porn, but it’s unlikely they’re entirely working. Forty-five percent of teenagers know how to hide their location using a VPN, and you can still find porn of every conceivable genre on Reddit. Even if you live in a blue state, you have probably sensed a simmeringbacklashagainst porn. It’s a disparate movement that doesn’t adhere to conventional political lines. Anti-porn sentiment permeates the manosphere, where people like Jordan Peterson argue that it’s a barrier to healthy intimacy—something that many feminists agree with. In interviews,Gracie AbramsandBillie Eilishhave described regretting their youthful exposure to porn. Porn has been blamed for themale lonelinessepidemic,misogyny in pop culture, and thedecline in the global fertility rate. Gen Z hasexpressed distaste for sex scenes in movies and on television. “Things have gotten really anti-sex over the past decade or so,” says Maia Raymer, senior editor of the smut magazineDirty.“On the right, we’ve seen the rise of Christian nationalism. On the left, the woke era put a lot of fear in people” by “patrolling and policing” their desires. This sex-averse cultural climate is a point of inspiration for porn performer Siri Dahl. On a recentOnlyFanslivestream, Dahl dressed up as a Puritan woman—complete with a bonnet and a scarlet letterAon her black dress—and slowly became “corrupted” over the course of the stream, for tips from her fans. She labeled a carnival wheel with different scenarios to act out (like “the devil possesses your butt”). Each spin raised the stakes until her dress came off and she stood in lingerie. “It was a very fun show,” she tells me. “My fans really loved it, and it was so goofy.” But shortly after Dahl saved the footage to her account’s archive, OnlyFans removed it without warning. It happens—online sex workers frequently struggle to stay one step ahead of the fickle whims of platform censors. Porn sites answer to their payment processors, who answer to credit card companies that seek to limit their liability, resulting in rules that seem increasingly arbitrary and unreasonable to creators. The OnlyFans support team wrote to Dahl that she’d violated their terms of service. “I wonder if the AI watching the video was algorithmically saying,This is blasphemous,” Dahl says. “Am I offending the Puritans, a religious group that hasn't even been around for hundreds of years?” (\u0000\u0000“All content on the platform is subject to human-led, technology assisted moderation,” a representative for OnlyFans wrote toGQin an email. “We monitor for hateful content, including material that incites religious hatred.”) OnlyFans also called her clip “illegal content,” a designation typically reserved for material depicting non-consenting parties and minors. Age-gating websites is more burdensome than throwing a brown paper bag over a copy ofPenthouseat the gas station. Lighthearted, vaguely religious erotic cosplay is not illegal in the United States—it’s constitutionally protected free speech. But a Supreme Court ruling expected in June,Free Speech Coalition, Inc. vs. Paxton,stands to enlarge the grounds on which speech can be restricted. The case arose in Texas, where an adult industry trade group sued over age-verification laws. It says these laws represent government overreach, and should be subject to rigorous judicial scrutiny. According to precedent, if the state has a compelling interest in keeping porn away from minors, it must use the “least restrictive” means possible when limiting access for adults. The proponents of age-gating laws describe them as the common sense, digital equivalent of checking IDs at the liquor store, but the adult industry argues that the surveillance and privacy risks of sharing personal data online makes things murkier. Age-gating is costly for websites, they point out, and invasive enough to deter adult users. It’s more burdensome than throwing a brown paper bag over a copy ofPenthouseat the gas station. Age-gating lawshave broad, bipartisan appeal. But they aren’t the end game of the anti-porn movement. Project 2025 co-author and former director of the Office of Management and Budget Russell Vought reportedly celebrated the age-gate laws at the center of the Supreme Court decision. The goal, he said in a hidden-camera recordingpublished by the Intercept, is to hold porn platforms liable when children wrongfully access porn, effectively putting them out of business. Hecalledthe laws a “back door” route to “a national ban on pornography.” Oklahoma has already introduceda billthat would imprison people for possession of all sexually explicit material, with one exception—sexting between married couples, as God intended. And if age-gate laws are upheld, the implications could reach much further than free tube sites like Pornhub. The decision could enable the government to restrict any speech they believe is “harmful to minors,” a mutable, subjective judgment. (They’ll know it when they see it). The ACLU worries that sites that host R-rated movies, sex education materials, and LGBTQ content could be imperiled—along with the people who make and share these things. Project 2025 describesits next steps as follows: “The people who produce and distribute [pornography] should be imprisoned. Educators and public librarians who purvey it should be classed as registered sex offenders. And telecommunications and technology firms that facilitate its spread should be shuttered.” In order to understandthe roots of the anti-porn backlash, you have to appreciate​​ that, for a few brief years, it felt like porn had entered a second golden age. The old,Boogie Nights–style studio model of production—which concentrated control of the industry among a handful of ethically questionable owners—was waning. So too was the era of stolen content, when pirated porn got pumped out on tube sites before the people in it could get paid. A generation of cam girls discovered they didn’t need to move to the San Fernando Valley or sleep with directors to make money in porn; they didn’t necessarily have to sleep with anyone. They could stream solo content from their bedrooms, at their convenience, and on their own terms. The big porn sites got safer too: In 2020, Pornhubblocked uploads from unverified users, responding toNew York Timesreports that the platform was vulnerable to child sexual abuse material and other illegal content. The OnlyFans model was well-suited to the isolating days of COVID lockdowns, whencreators formed lucrative, parasocial bonds with their fans in the DMs. “The majority of adult content happens independently,” says Jessica Van Meir, the cofounder of MintStars, an adult content and payment platform, “and the workers can choose what they’re comfortable doing.” (While OnlyFans takes a cut of creator earnings, newer sites like MintStars don’t.) Some performers, especially those who fled academia or the creative industries due to diminishing wages, entered the industry with a sharp, fully-formed political consciousness, eager to assert their agency and labor rights. This era of indie porn is decidedly DIY—anyone with a smartphone and an internet connection can participate. The hyper-glam Hollywood aesthetic that reigned supreme in the 1990s and early 2000s has given way to the “girl next door” with tattoos. Eventually, indie porn broke containment. With no internal discovery system on OnlyFans, creators set up shop on dating apps, Reddit, TikTok, and elsewhere to market their work. Few users welcomed this influx; one male acquaintance told me he found it “predatory.” When real sex workers showed up alongside a deluge of bots, slop, and spam, it felt like evidence of the overallworsening of digital experiences, the so-called enshittification of the internet. Commentary about extreme performers like Lily Phillips and Bonnie Blue seems to rise to the top of the X algorithm, giving the impression that their particular brand of shock value entertainment represents pornography as a whole, and setting the stage for a full-blown moral panic. At the same time, the idea of porn addiction—a theory largely advanced by faith-based groups, anddisputed by mainstream psychologists—has settled into conventional wisdom. You might have heard something along the lines of,Porn fries our dopamine receptors, orPorn triggers the same neural reward pathways as meth and coke. But this is purely speculative. To prove something like that, “you would need a study where someone is both administered methamphetamine and shown pornography,” says Dr. Nicole Prause, a neuroscientist who researches sexual behavior. “That study doesn’t exist, and I don't think it ever will.” “If someone is saying, I have a problem, then that problem is real. But there's not a conversation happening like that on the left. The only people reaching out to them are anti-sex or anti-woman.” The existing research on porn’s impact iscontradictory. For people religiously or morally opposed to pornography, its use does seem to have negative impacts, by triggering a sense of shame. But porn is also “associated with increased sexual and relationship satisfaction when you have an existing partner and they're aware of your use,” Prause explains. She sees porn-addiction treatment, “NoFap” coaches, and companies likeCovenant Eyes(the app that House Speaker Mike Johnsonsaid he uses to monitor his teenage son’s porn habits) as “big business” rather than good science. “It’s a money grab,” she says. Some experts say the anti-porn backlash can be understood as a proxy for discomfort with our increasingly depersonalized online lives. “People are drawn to porn-addiction narratives because they know something doesn't feel quite right about existing in alienated social worlds,” says Dr. Heather Berg, a professor of labor and gender studies at UCLA. “Tech capital has invaded our most intimate spaces.” Berg has also observed “a growing dissatisfaction with sex positivity” among her students. For men and women who came of age during the #MeToo era, it’s not a big leap to associate sex with harm more than with pleasure. But if a young man is feeling bad about his porn or masturbation habits, and looking for answers online, he is unlikely to be welcomed by liberals or progressives offering help. “If someone is saying, I have a problem, then that problem is real,” Raymer says, but “there's not a conversation happening like that on the left. The only people reaching out to them are anti-sex or anti-woman.” It might seem counterintuitive that a backlash against porn arrived just when the industry started becoming safer and allowing for greater performer autonomy. But according to Mike Stabile, director of Public Policy for the Free Speech Coalition, the rise of independent creators has not been embraced by everyone. “A decade ago, young men didn't pay for porn, and suddenly the power has shifted, and now there’s a sort of subservient relationship,” Stabile explains. “Women across all sectors of society are finding they're able to monetize their sexuality.” Men feel conflicted about paying for porn, he says, and manosphere influencers like Andrew Tate push the idea that “that porn turns alpha males into betas.” Women, too, report resenting their partners’ interactions with OnlyFans models, especially whenthey become secretive and costly. We were more comfortable with porn, it seems, when its production felt further removed from us as consumers, when it seemed like the performers couldn’t talk back, make their own rules, or set their own prices. Perhaps we preferred the days when it was less plausible that an ex-girlfriend, sister, or daughter might dabble in cam work or sell nudes between jobs. “Sentiment towards online nudie girls went from fond-neutral to outright hostile” in recent years, the sex worker, data scientist, and Substacker who goes byAella has written. She says that apps and websites have cracked down on creator profiles; her account on OkCupid was deleted after 10 years, even though she never used it to sell anything. Most sex workers have a story like this. “The mood behind the scenes is grim,” says Chloe Corrupt, an AVN-nominated adult performer and director. “Social media posts are getting half the engagement and twice the hateful replies.” With a two-front waron porn underway, adult industry workers find themselves asking: Who will defend porn? It’s something most people consume in private while condemning in public. Siri Dahl suspects that “a lot of guys would be genuinely upset if porn was made illegal, but they wouldn't ever stand up to say that, because they don't want to be called a simp.” Free speech warriors have plenty of other fights to take on. And Democrats routinely vote for legislationthat curtails sexual expression. While Chloe Corrupt acknowledges “a coordinated effort from the far right” behind the pressures on adult content, she also blames the industry “for largely fighting these battles in court, without engaging with the broader court of public opinion.” All of the adult industry professionals I spoke with agreed that minors shouldn’t have unfettered access to porn, but none of them think blocking the more above-ground sites will help. “In Florida, you can’t go to Pornhub. But I just went on Google image search and saw a wide, gaping asshole,” jokes Cheri DeVille, a performer who brands herself as “the internet’s stepmom.” Her tone turns serious. In sending users away from “legal, compliant, ethical sites with paperwork and enthusiastic consent from the models,” she says, these laws might drive traffic to platforms that don’t “play ball with American law,” which are more likely to contain content produced without model releases or labor protections for performers—like revenge porn, pirated footage, deepfakes, and child sexual abuse material. “We agree with the spirit of the law,” says Alex Kekesi, head of community and brand for Aylo, Porhhub’s parent company, “but people who want to consume porn aren’t just going to stop looking at it overnight because one site that they like isn’t available in their area. They're going to go to another platform.”New researchon the impact of age-gating supports these claims. In the states that have mandated it, traffic to compliant websites—those requiring IDs—decreased by 51%, but searches for VPNs increased by 23.6%, and traffic to noncompliant websites increased by 48.1%. Adult content is now produced by a larger and more diverse group of people than ever before, and their work spans the outer limits of the human erotic imagination. The migration away from legitimate sites is already impacting performers. Some who saw their income plummet after age-verification laws took effect have turned to in-person sex work, which poses greater risks than porn because it remains criminalized almost everywhere in the US. “Many of us have been taking on clients that we would otherwise say no to, in the name of filling the gap left by lagging sales,” Chloe Corrupt says. Others are pivoting to forms of media less likely to come under attack. Siri Dahl launched a podcast and recently recorded her first video essay for YouTube. Even if you don’t personally consume or approve of pornography, Kekesi says, you should be worried “about having to show government ID to access something online [which is] constitutionally protected. That should feel uncomfortable to sit with.” The battle for freedom of expression has always been fought over sexually explicit material, from Henry Miller’sTropic of Cancerto Larry Flynt’sHustler.To argue that the newer technology of porn on smartphones poses an unprecedented type of harm “is really a dodge,” says First Amendment attorney Robert Corn-Revere, who filed a brief with the court on behalf of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE). “The problem is conceptual, not technological…and it’s not a solution for the government to fill the role of the parent.” Plus, as First Amendment experts point out, censorship tends to expand to encompass more than its original target. In this round of the porn wars,school library books, andPride merchandisehave already been removed in some areas, with the justification that they’re “harmful to minors.” Vera Eidelman, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU, says the larger question is how much power we want to give the government “to silence speech that it doesn't like.” Still, there are few voices today willing to defend porn for its own sake. When we suggest that protecting the good speech (erotic literature, sexual health and LGBTQ material) means begrudgingly accepting the distasteful speech (people having sex on camera)—do we fall into a trap of respectability? Porn’s critics tend to imagine that hard-core scenes of violent sex between dominant men and submissive women represent the industry as a whole. But in its current form, porn is much weirder than that. It includes things like Aella’s work as a nude mime, and the photo set in which she’s kidnapped by garden gnomes. It encompasses newer genres likepolitically themed humiliation,financial domination, mythical beast role-play, and erotic hypnosis. Adult content is now produced by a larger and more diverse group of people than ever before, and their work spans the outer limits of the human erotic imagination. When we view porn through the narrow lens of morality rather than the expansive lens of human expression, we ignore its anarchic and artistic possibilities. “Who do you think is making this stuff?” asks Lorelei Lee, a longtime porn performer and sex worker’s rights activist. “It's everybody who got an art school degree and doesn't have access to the Whitney or whatever.”",

    "title": "Turns Out That RFK Jr.’s Plan to Make America Healthy Again Doesn’t Include Most Pregnant Women or Children",
    "article_text": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr.announced Tuesday that the Department of Health and Human Services will no longer recommend that “healthy” pregnant women and children receive the COVID vaccine, despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently advising that all Americans six months and older receive the updated vaccine, and warning that pregnancy puts people at risk of becoming seriously ill from the virus, as well as suffering serious pregnancy complications. In a sub-60-second video posted on X, Kennedy—who hassaidhis brain was partially eaten by a worm that crawled inside and died—smiles while declaring he “couldn’t be more pleased to announce that as of today the COVID vaccine for healthy children and healthy pregnant women has been removed from the CDC-recommended immunization schedule.” He adds: “We’re now one step closer to realizing President Trump’s promise to make America healthy again.” This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. National Institutes of Health directorJay Bhattacharya,who also appears in the video, as does Food and Drug Administration commissionerMartin Makary,calls the decision “common sense” and “good science.” Makary claims, “There’s no evidence healthy kids need it today, and most countries have stopped recommending it for children.” AsThe Washington Postnotes, “the social media post did not offer a detailed explanation about the move.”Georges C. Benjamin,the executive director of the American Public Health Association, told the outlet he was unaware of any data supporting Kennedy and Co.’s claims. “Are they making this decision without going to any of their advisory committees?” Benjamin said. “Show us the evidence, the studies that have been done.… I don’t know of any.” In fact, the CDC has previously said pregnant people are at higher risk of becoming very ill from COVID and are at an increased risk of pregnancy complications—including stillbirth. Last year, a study from the Cleveland Clinic, published inThe EMBO Journal,showedthat “mild and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections can trigger immune responses in a pregnant individual that may cause serious inflammatory responses in the developing fetus.” Receiving the vaccine during pregnancy alsoprovides protectionfor newborn babies, who are at high risk of developing serious complications. “It’s really concerning,”Sean O’Leary,MD, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Committee on Infectious Diseases,told NPR. “I think it’s going to be confusing not only for parents but also for public health professionals and medical professionals as well. This takes away choice.”Steven J. Fleischman,MD, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said in a statement, “As ob-gyns who treat patients every day, we have seen firsthand how dangerous COVID infection can be during pregnancy and for newborns who depend on maternal antibodies from the vaccine for protection. The science has not changed. It is very clear that COVID infection during pregnancy can be catastrophic and lead to major disability.\" Currently, the CDC websitestatesthat COVID vaccination for children “is safe,” that “getting vaccinated helps protect children against COVID-19,“ and that “children who have already had COVID-19 should still get vaccinated.” Last year, a studypublishedinJAMAconcluded that its “analysis of 3,913,063 cases suggest reduced pediatric SARS-CoV-2 transmission following immunization,” and that “these results support the use of COVID-19 vaccines to reduce COVID-19 incidence and hospitalization in pediatric populations.” Kennedy is, of course, alongtime anti-vaxxerwho has falselyclaimedthe COVID vaccine was the “deadliest vaccine ever made.” He onceinvolved himselfin a vaccine controversy in Samoa and traveled to the country to amplify local anti-vaccine advocates, months before a deadly measles outbreak killed 83 people on the island nation. Earlier this month, amidst a measles outbreak in the US, heorderedfederal agencies to find new treatments for the disease, despite the vaccine being wildly effective.

    "title": "Which Cannes 2025 Standout Will Make It All the Way to the 2026 Oscars?",
    "article_text": "The 78th Cannes Film Festival came to a close on May 24, capping off an 11-day celebration of international film—complete withan hours-long, city-wide power outageleading up to the awards ceremony. But the show did indeed go on, and a handful of filmsreceived the festival circuit’s highest honorsin front of a black-tie-clad crowd. The Palme d’Or went toJafar Panahi’sIt Was Just an Accident,another sharp look at life in contemporary Iran from the lauded guerilla director—who has often run afoul of his government, at great risk to his own life and liberty. At the post-ceremony press conference, jury presidentJuliette Binochesaid that Panahi’s film “springs from a feeling of resistance, survival, which is absolutely necessary today.” Panahi’s was not the only political film recognized by the jury—which included American actorsJeremy StrongandHalle Berry,among others. They awarded best actress to first-time performerNadia Mellitifor her work inHafsia Herzi’sThe Little Sister, a look at the Parisian daughter of Algerian immigrants who is struggling against the strictures of her home culture and a dawning realization about her sexuality. Meanwhile,Wagner Mourawon best actor forThe Secret Agent,Kleber Mendonça Filho’sstrange, expansive period pieceabout a turbulent time in Brazil’s history. The jury was clearly high on that film, also awarding Filho best director. (It’s become somewhat rare for a film to win more than one award at Cannes.) Melliti’s win was predicted by some on the ground at the festival, while others thought thatJennifer Lawrence’sblistering turninLynne Ramsay’sDie, My Lovewould emerge victorious. But this was not the Americans’ year on the Croisette; they left entirely empty-handed. With Cannes done, we must now turn to the future—as is our solemn duty every year—and wonder just what this all might mean for the Oscars. On this week’s episode ofLittle Gold Men,our hosts discuss many of those possibilities. Is Lawrence’s campaign dinged by a Cannes loss? Not necessarily. The bigger question might be whether this year’s crop of competitors will continue the Cannes-to-Oscars success rate seen, in unprecedented fashion, in 2023 and 2024. In each of those years, three Cannes competition films were nominated for best picture. And the Palme d’Or winner has been nominated for best picture four times since 2019, winning twice forParasiteandAnora. It Was Just an Accidentwill certainly have strong support from the international branch of the Academy—and seems a shoo-in for an international-feature nomination—but no Iranian film has ever been nominated in best picture. That could all change this year, but could take some serious stumping on the part of the film’s distributor, the now six-time Palme-predicting Cannes juggernaut Neon. Another viable contender is Norway’sSentimental Value,alush family dramafromJoachim Trier,whoseThe Worst Person in the Worldwas nominated for two Oscars in 2021. That film’s campaign will be aided by the Stateside star power ofStellan Skarsgård—hot off the success of Disney+’sAndor—and could get a mild profile boost from supporting playerElle Fanning. The other strong possibility isRichard Linklater’sNouvelle Vague,a sprightly and winsome bit of historical fiction chronicling the making of Jean-Luc Godard’s seminal New Wave filmBreathless.WhileNouvelleVaguedidn’t pick up any trophies at Cannes (though we hear Binoche was gaga for it), Netflix acquired the film out of the festival and is sure to give it a big push in the fall, including replays at big September festivals. Think of the film—black-and-white, nostalgic for the film industry of the past—as this year’sThe Artist.Only without any of the bad Weinstein Company associations.

    "title": "Macron Insists Wife Shove Was Just Them Being Sexy and French, You Provincial Hacks",
    "article_text": "EmmanuelandBrigitte Macronwhipped the internet and conservative media into a frenzy over the weekend, when video circulated showing the latter aggressively shoving the former’s face just before they stepped off a plane in Vietnam. Were they in the midst of a domestic dispute? Does the French first lady regularly manhandle her husband when she’s seemingly unaware that cameras are rolling? Is their marriage in trouble? According to the French president, none of the above. Instead, what people saw was merely part of their standard repartee, which he doesn’t expect prudes like you to understand. On Monday, Macronsaidhe and his wife were simply “bickering and, rather, joking around,” saying that’s something “we often do.” Speaking to TMZ, a French officialcalledthe interaction “a moment when the president and his wife were relaxing one last time before the start of the trip by having a laugh. It was a moment of closeness.” Maybe in your unsophisticated circles this sort of thing is uncommon, but for the Macrons, it’s their thing; if there weren’t state business to attend to, perhaps it would have led to throes of passion and a shared cigarette. Commenting on the reaction to the footage, Macron said, “I’m surprised by it. It turns into some kind of global catastrophe where people are even coming up with theories to explain it. It’s nonsense.” He added that conspiracy theories about the footage were part of a disinformation campaign started by “crazy people.” Nearly three weeks ago,a videofeaturing Macron, German chancellorFriedrich Merz,and British prime ministerKeir Starmershowed a tissue on the table they were sitting around, leading to wild claims that it was a “bag of cocaine.” In response, Macron’s officesaidin a statement: “When European unity becomes inconvenient, disinformation goes so far as to make a simple tissue look like drugs. This fake news is being spread by France’s enemies, both abroad and at home. We must remain vigilant against manipulation.” A right-wing French commentator told Europe 1 that the video of the Macrons indicated “there may be domestic violence against men” and that the French president “cannot even command respect from his wife when there are cameras in front of him.” In his remarks to reporters, Macron also referred toa videoof a recent handshake between him and Turkish presidentRecep TayyipErdoğan,which he said was another source of disinformation against him. “It’s been three weeks—if you look at the international agenda of the president of the French Republic, from Kyiv to Tirana to Hanoi, there are people who have watched the videos and believe that I shared a bag of cocaine, that I had a ‘mano a mano’ with a Turkish president, and that right now I’m having a fight with my wife. None of this is true,” he told reporters. “So everyone needs to calm down and focus on the real news.” The Macrons, whometwhen Emmanuel was 15 and Brigitte was 39—and a teacher at his school—are hardly the first duo to be captured on camera in an exchange that left people wondering about the state of their relationship. In 2014,Beyoncéwasseenwatching her sister,Solange Knowles,kick and hitJay-Zin an elevator following a Met Gala after-party. A few years later, first ladyMelania Trumpappeared toslapher husband’s hand away as he tried to hold hers after disembarking from Air Force One in Tel Aviv. She eventuallysharedin her memoir that the red carpet that had been laid out for the couple, Israeli prime ministerBenjamin Netanyahu,and his wife,Sara,“simply could not accommodate all four of us abreast,” claiming that interpretations to the contrary were the work of the media and “gossipmongers.” The UnsinkableKathy Bates Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years.

    "article_text": "Napoleon Bonaparte is back in the spotlight. The emperor, who is a silver screen staple in his own right thanks to filmmakers like Abel Gance andRidley Scott, continues to fascinate a community passionate about the Empire era. Now this leader whose equal parts warring and romantic career profoundly altered the balance of power in Europe is once again front of mind for the public though he has remained a fixture forPierre-Jean Chalençon, a collector made popular for appearing onVos Objets Ont Une HistoireandAffaire Conclue. On June 25,Chalençon's extensive Imperial collection will be auctioned by Sotheby's. According to Sotheby's Director of European Furniture and Decorative Arts, “Chalençon's collection reflects some four decades of passionate collecting, study, research and instinctive connoisseurship. It presents an extraordinary synthesis of Napoleonic history, combining great historical symbols with intimate relics.” Among these relics, we spotted some particularly noteworthy objects, such as Napoleon and Josephine's marriage certificate (estimated at $34,000 to $56,000), the Empress's dressing table (estimated at $226,000 to $453,000), or if a bidder would prefer a throne outright, they'll have the option for around $453,000. While one of the stars of this sale may be Napoleon's portable bed—which he loved so much he took it everywhere with him—it's a ring that is worth some consideration. The gold and diamond signet ring presented by Napoleon to Monsieur Hans de Bruyère. The gold and diamond signet ring presented by Napoleon to Monsieur Hans de Bruyère. This signet ring, stamped with a capital N surmounted by a crown, was presented to Monsieur Hans de Bruyère, commander of the Nijmegen mounted honor guard, during Napoleon's visit to the former kingdom of Holland in the autumn of 1811. Made of gold and diamonds, it was crafted in the workshops of Marc-Etienne Nitot, which later became Chaumet. The price of this treasure? According to the experts at Sotheby's, it is between $226,679 and $340,018, but could go for much higher.

    "title": "Meghan Markle’s As Ever Is Getting a Restock, But You’ll Have to Wait for New Products",
    "article_text": "On Tuesday,Meghan Marklereleased the final episode of her eight-episode podcast series,Confessions of a Female Founder,which ended with a spiritual and emotional interview with Spanx founderSara Blakely.This week marks the end of her recent press run, which began whenMeghan rejoined Instagramand dropped the trailer for her Netflix series,With Love, Meghan,in January, but her relaunch as an entrepreneur is just getting started. A source close to the duchess toldVanity Fairthat products for her As Ever brand will be restocked on her website soon. For the last two months, the company’s website has shown its product range, including raspberry preserves, crepe and cookie mix, and flower sprinkles,all of which sold out in less than an hour in April. In recent weeks, Meghan has teased a few big announcements on the As Ever Instagram page, and her Netflix show,With Love, Meghan,is due to air its second season this fall. Still,Fast Companyreports that the company likely won’t expand its range of products until early next year. In an interview with the magazine, the duchess said she plans to take a step back and analyze the data from the brand's launch. “I want to really focus on the hospitality angle of As Ever, but as we take the learnings, we can understand what the customer’s needs are seasonally,” she told the magazine, adding that she will continue to be motivated by the love of her own home. “Everything comes from being rooted in the love story of your home and garden, and then you can imagine different verticals coming out of that.” The duchess said that she is still working on product development with Netflix’s Consumer Products Group. “We are on calls daily, working through product development, SKUs, and inventory,” she said. “We have a field trip tomorrow to look at different manufacturers and suppliers as we expand the brand.” The company was launched as a tie-in to the show, but she added that she intentionally gave it a different name. “The brand is in the same universe at the show, but they’re not the same.” Her current trademark application doesn’t include any intention for clothing under the name—perhaps due to another fashion brand’s association with the As Ever name—but Meghan is already an investor in other women-owned companies. She also hasa ShopMy page, where she posts affiliate links to the outfits and accessories she wears in her social media posts. In theFast Companyinterview, the duchess hinted at future plans in the arena. “The category of fashion is something I will explore at a later date,” she said, “because I do think that’s an interesting space for me.” The UnsinkableKathy Bates Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years.

    "title": "So, Who's Leaving 'Saturday Night Live' This Fall?",
    "article_text": "Saturday Night Live’ssplashy 50th season has officially come to an end, which means it will likely be the end of the road for some ofSNL’smost beloved cast members. The jam-packed season unfolded during a presidential election and includeda livestreamed concert at Radio City,as well asthe star-studdedSNL50eventthat saw celebrities and former cast members returning to studio 8H. While no cast members have officially announced their departure since the season finale ofSNL,hosted byScarlett Johannsonon May 17,it wouldn’t be a shock if some major names decided to leaveLorne Michaels’slate-night sketch show after this momentous year. Especially given whatKenan ThompsonrecentlytoldPage Six.SNL’s longest-running cast member described the ending of season 50 as “bittersweet” and delicately hinted that the cast may look a bit different whenSNLreturns in the fall. “Especially this year,” he said, “it feels like there’s maybe, possibly, a lot of change next year. You want everyone to stay forever, knowing that people may be making decisions this summer…it’s always like you want your kids to stay young.” The show’s cast is arguably somewhat due for a shake-up. Most of its current members—12 repertory players and 5 featured players—have been with the show since season 49. Ahead of season 50, the show only cut three people—full-time cast memberPunkie Johnsonas well as featured playersMolly KearneyandChloe Troast—and replaced them with three newbies:Jane Wickline,Emil Wakim, andAshley Padilla. So, now that season 50 is all said and done, which of the 17 current cast members might be packing up their wigs and joke books? Here are a few theories. After this year’s season finale, the internet was abuzz with rumors that Yang would leave the show. TheSNLstandout seemed conspicuously emotional during the cast goodbyes as the credits rolled. In an interview withEntertainment Weekly,Yang said he “was just processing that being one of the last ‘last nights’ that I would have, and that is a huge thing.” But when asked directly, he wouldn’t say whether he will return for season 51 or not. Yang has been performing onSNLfor six seasons, and began as a writer even earlier, in 2018. Those familiar with the inner workings ofSNLknow that Michaels allegedly locks each member of his cast into seven-year contracts before giving them the chance to renegotiate or walk away. At six seasons as a cast member and one as a writer, Yang is bumping up against that seven-year mark. And he may have a seven-year itch as well. Yang is one of the busiest cast members outside of Studio 8H: He’s got a bustling film career, with major roles inThe Wedding Banquetand theWickedfilms. He’s also one half of the iHeartRadio Award-winning podcastLas Culturistas,which Yang hosts with his best friend,Matt Rogers. The podcast is so popular that its affiliated award show, “The Culture Awards,” is airing live on Bravo this August. Yang hasspoken at lengthabout the toll his many professional obligations have taken on his health, saying he went through a “rough patch” and “bad bouts of depersonalization” during his tenure onSNL. On the brighter side, Yang has earned four acting Emmy nominations for his work on the show—making him the only current cast member to earn an individual nod—and has more than his fair share of iconic sketches under his belt. (We all remember where we were when theTitanic icebergdropped.) Having basically hit the seven-year mark and made an indelible mark on the program, it might be time for him to spread his wings and fly away. Yang has apparently at least considered the prospect. “SNL, it’s just this moving, living, breathing thing,”he toldPeople.“Especially after the 50th, I’m seeing what life after the show is like and how beautiful it is, and how so many people, no matter how long they were at the show, are just with their families and loving their lives and not letting the years take away any of that experience for them. And then withSNL…new people come in and you do have to sort of make way for them and to grow and to keep elevating themselves. That inevitably requires me to sort of hang it up at some point—but I don’t know what the vision is yet.” The reigning queen of impressions, Fineman has been getting laughs asTimothée Chalamet,Jennifer Coolidge,Drew Barrymore,and many others in Studio 8H for six seasons. But while she’s certainly made an impression onSNL, according to afew setsofexpert calculations,Fineman has recently gotten less screen time than otherSNLvets. (PerVariety,the five with the most screen time this season were Bowen Yang,Andrew Dismukes,Sarah Sherman, Colin Jost,andEgo Nwodim). Part of this could be blamed on Fineman coming down with COVID as a result ofSNL 50,and having to miss a week of taping. But that doesn’t explain her not appearing on the show’s more recentWalton Gogginsepisode. Are Fineman and her many public personas ready to walk out the door? Like Yang, with whom she joined the cast in 2019, Fineman has also found work outside the confines of NBC. She recently starred as a stripper in the Hulu movieSummer of 69,and has a role in theFreakier Fridaysequel, starringLindsay Lohan, whom she just interviewed forElle. Fineman is also set to star inLove Language, a rom-com fromJoey Power,and pickleball comedyThe Dink. And who could forget (and, honestly, who could blame her) for making a foray into prestige cinema withFrancis Ford Coppola’sMegalopolis. This winter, Fineman also starred in the Broadway showAll InwithSNLalumniJohn MulaneyandAidy Bryant. There’s been no indication that Fineman is ready to leave. She’s also on year six of seven on her contract, so it makes sense that she’d stick around at least one final year to see it through. But while her female compatriots like Sherman and Nwodim seem to be hitting their stride atSNL, it does feel like Fineman—who popped early and often due to her zinger impressions—may be setting her sights elsewhere. Nah. He’s a lifer. Mikey Day, who has been yukking it up onSaturday Night Livefor nine seasons, could also be a lifer. Day actually joined SNL as a writer in 2013, making his officialSNLtenure 12 seasons long. While he may not be the most recognizable name onSNL, he’s certainly a reliable addition to every sketch, whether he’s playing the straight man orLord Gaga. He’s also worked outside ofSNL, hosting the popular Netflix game showIs It Cake?(the answer will often surprise you.) But whenDeadlineasked Day if he was returning forSNLseason 51, he replied, “Who knows what the future will bring?” It’s cryptic, but not exactly cause to ring the alarm. Day is also very close with currentSNLhead writerStreeter Seidell.Together, they’ve cowritten memorable sketches likeTom Hanks’sDavid S. Pumpkins sketch andNate Bargatze’sWashington’s Dream sketch. As long as Seidell is running the show, all signs point to the pair maintaining their fruitful collaboration. Case in point: Almost a decade into his tenure as a cast member, Day still finds ways to surprise and delight on the show. His recent one-joke “Weekend Update” bit,“A Guy Who Just Walked Into a Spider Web on Trump’s Tariffs”was a season highlight, and even got a special shoutout from his buddy Seidell. “Shit like this is why I love writing with@mikeyfuntime,”Seidell posted on X. “He will give 100% to even the stupidest idea and turn it into gold. And he’s not afraid to try something new like a super short one-joke update just for fun. I had no idea he could fall that fast, with no padding, that fast.” Yeah—we have a feeling Day will stick around for season 51. After dutifully servingSNLfor 20 years, Jost has become emblematic ofSaturday Night Live. He started as a writer in 2005, working his way up to head writer and “Weekend Update” cohost withMichael Che, where he’s been sitting pretty since 2014—making him the longest-serving anchor in the history of the segment. You can’t say he hasn’t had a great run onSNL. But maybe Jost is ready to bow out of the race. In his 2020 memoir,A Very Punchable Face, Jost wrote that heconsidered leavingSNLsometime after the 2020 election. Clearly, that didn’t happen. Five years later, another presidential cycle has come and gone, and Jost is still sitting behind the same “Weekend Update” desk. Leaving after season 50 would be poetic in some ways, especially considering the fact that his wife, movie star Scarlett Johannson, hosted the season finale. Jost even ran out to kiss Johansson and hand her a bouquet of roses during the episode’s bows, a cute way to simultaneously congratulate your wife and say goodbye to your job of two decades. The real question is what Jost would leaveSNLtodo. Beyond hostingPop Culture Jeopardy!on Prime Video, Jost’s on-camera work has been mostly sequestered toSNL. He hasn’t made the leap to movies or sitcom television, like his “Weekend Update” forerunnersTina FeyandAmy Poehler. There’s always the possibility of hosting a late-night television show, likeSeth MeyersorJimmy Fallon,but those opportunities are becoming increasingly rare. (CBS just cancelled its late-night comedy offering,After Midnight).SNLis a plum gig, and Jost is clearly beloved there. Why leave? If anything, it seems Jost might stay—as a prime candidate for taking over the reins from Lorne Michaels, should he ever decide to retire. While he’s not a shoe-in (Tina Fey is also still living and breathing and resides in New York), you’d have to imagine that Jost is on the long list, if not short list. Perhaps that’s an argument for sticking around: Stay until the bitter end, and you just might geta kiss from Daddy. One person who seemingly does not care about receiving the kiss from Daddy: Jost’s “Weekend Update” co-anchor, Michael Che. In the stand-up sets he performs between seasons, Che hasrepeatedly saidthat he’s leavingSaturday NightLive—only to pop up behind the desk as the “Weekend Update” co-anchor time and time again. So, is Che the boy who cried wolf? Or will season 50 really be the end for him? Time will tell. Che definitely has aspirations beyond the confines of Studio 8H. He starred in and produced a sketch series for HBO,That Damn Michael Che,that lasted for two seasons; perhaps there’s more where that came from. Or maybe he wants to do comedy in a less constrictive environment. Last year, Che received a fair amount of blowback for an off-color joke he made about Jost’s Oscar-nominated wife thatshe did not appreciate.(He apologized to Johanssonduring the season finale, though). Never one to shy away fromhis critics on social media,Che has routinely blasted his haters and those who don’t vibe with his specific brand of no-holds-barred humor. He’s made it work onSNLsince 2014, but he might be ready to strike out on his own again. The longest-serving current female cast member atSNL, Gardner is queen of the “Weekend Update” guest appearance and proven herself to be an asset in any sketch over the course of her eight seasons on the show. But being a dependable utility player can also take its toll. In arecent interviewwithCraig Fergusonon his podcastJoy, Gardner said that after almost a decade atSNL, things have gotten “a little tough” for her as of late. “I will say the only thing that I’ve started to feel a little bit is just sketch fatigue, or idea fatigue,” she said. “At this point, after doing Groundlings andSNLfor so long, I’m, like, ‘I’ve written a lot of sketches.’” Gardner stars on the Apple TV+ seriesShrinkingand has also been popping up in more and more commercials (who could forget herHomes.com ad withDan Levy?). She has arguably made it toCecily Strongstatus as a recognizableSNLvet who now has the face recognition (if not the name recognition) to sow her wild oats elsewhere. According toDeadline, she was recently in talks to star in an NBC pilot. (Although even when those get picked up, they don’t always take off—justask Kenan Thompson.) Ahead of the season 50 finale, Gardner posted a sweet but slightly cryptic caption about a trip to upstate NY some of theSNLwriters and cast took. “My heart is so full being with this vibrant family of mine,\" she said. “The things we do remind me of the fun of the past. The things we experience together keep me present and watching each person be their authentic self makes me so hopeful for the future.” But what does Gardner’s future hold? Only hertarot card readerknows for sure. Look: Lorne’s 80.SNLis 50. Back in 2021, Michaels toldCBS Mornings’Gayle Kingthat SNL’s 50th anniversary would be a “really good time to leave.” It would make perfect sense for Lorne to say sayonara after this epic season of the little sketch show he brought into this world a half century ago. But Lorne isn’t in the business of making sense—he’s in the business of making comedy.This past September,he said he had “no immediate plan” to step down, and that “as long as I can keep doing it, I’ll keep doing it.” There we have it. Whoever wants to runSNLnext will have to pry it out of Lorne Michaels’s cold, dead, Canadian hands. The UnsinkableKathy Bates Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years.

    "title": "What Trump Really Wants from Tim Cook",
    "article_text": "Donald Trumpwas still arecently canned reality starand an underdog candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 when he first started picking on Apple. \"We're going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries,” hesaid in a speechat Liberty University. But that promise never panned out. Not during Trump 1.0. Not during the Biden years. Now, nearly a decade later, and despite all evidence that American-made iPhones would be unfeasibly, disastrously costly, Trump is at it again. In a post on Truth Social on Friday,Trump threatenedto saddle the Cupertino tech giant with 25 percent tariffs if it fails to manufacture iPhones in the U.S. “I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” he wrote. It was an about face from the administration’spreviously announced planto specifically exempt smartphones and electronic devices from so-called “reciprocal” tariffs on goods from China, a deal that Apple CEOTim Cookreceivedno small amount of credit for negotiating. Trump’s renewed threat came afterCook reportedly rebuffedthe White House's invitation to join the president on his Middle East trip. It also followed shortly after theFinancial Timesreported that Apple’s manufacturing contractor,Foxconn, is preparingto spend $1.5 billion to build a new plant in India, which will supply components to Apple. While its supply chain is still inextricably tied to China,Apple has reportedlybeen shifting assembly of a growing number of iPhones to India in an effort to bypass the escalating U.S.-China trade war and the on-again-off-again tariffs that have come with it. Apple simultaneously announcedit would invest $500 billion in the United States in the next four years. But apart from a commitment to manufacture servers in Houston and chips in Arizona, the announcement was light on details about what, exactly, that outpouring of cash will be spent on. Most glaringly, it made no mention of American-made iPhones—and with good reason. At leastone analyst has estimatedthat shifting manufacturing to the U.S. could drive up the cost of an iPhone to $3,500. But neither Apple's India workaround nor its vague promises to the U.S. have been sufficient. To Trump, it’s the American-made iPhone that has always been the apotheosis of making America great again. It would not just be a display of the country’s old school industrial strength applied to the most ubiquitous technology of today, it would also be a show of force, exhibiting Trump’s power over one of the most powerful companies in the world and the foreign countries that rely on its business. The good news for Apple, and for Americans who want to be able to afford iPhones, is that Trump’s thirst for credit can cut both ways. True to his reality show roots, history suggests Trump is always more focused on the fanfare of an announcement than on the follow through. Recall the ill-fated Foxconn factory in Wisconsin thatTrump hailed in 2018as the “eighth wonder of the world.” By the time itofficially fell apartleaving atrail of vacant buildingsin its wake, Trump was long gone, and whenhe returned to campaignin the swing state in 2024, it was as if the whole thing had never happened. Or remember the time in November 2019 when Cook took Trump on a tour of a Texas plant where an Apple contractor had been making MacBook Pros since 2013. Afterward,Trump announcedon Twitter that he had just “opened a major Apple Manufacturing plant in Texas that will bring high paying jobs back to America.” Apple let him have it, and it was among the moments that led to Trump's chummy relationship with Cook—or as he called himTim Apple— during his first term. Or think back to January, when OpenAI’sSam Altman, Oracle’sLarry Ellison, and Softbank’sMasayoshi Sonjoined Trumpat the White House to announce Stargate, a $100 billion AI venture that was already in the works long before Trump’s election. “We wouldn’t be able to do this without you, Mr. President,” Altman said at the time. Apple helped write this playbook, and it would be wise to put it into action now. That may entail, asDealbookhas suggested, unveiling a plan for iPhones that are “assembled in America.” That could leave the lion’s share of the company’s overseas supply chain intact. Such a compromise would hardly hinder China, whereApple has investedeye-watering sums of money to establish its manufacturing base. But it could give Trump a decent photo op, which, if history serves, may be all he really wants. The UnsinkableKathy Bates Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years.

    "title": "Joan Baez Thinks Timothée Chalamet Was “Too Clean” to Play Bob Dylan",
    "article_text": "The question, alas, comes right away. “I was hoping the first question would not even have his name,” laughsJoan Baez.Though the folk music icon has fought many battles, perhaps the longest has been her fight against being labeledBob Dylan’s ex. “I understand you can’t help it,” Baez continues. “I know I can’t. Once in my life, I had an interview that was just me. It was a German guy, and he gave a whole interview, and he never brought up the name. When we were finished, I said,hallelujah.” Now, 60 years after her relationship with Dylan—legendary, turbulent, artistically powerful—Baez is used to being asked about him. Not by Dylan himself, though. Last year Dylan gave his seal of approval toA Complete Unknown,a biopicstarringTimothée Chalametas Dylan andMonica Barbaroas Baez. Both got Oscar nominations for their performances. “I had an interview withRolling Stonethe other day, and they said, ‘Did Bob reach out to you [about the movie]?’ And I said, ‘You’ve been working atRolling Stonelong enough to know the answer to that question,’” Baez says. “He doesn’t reach out to anybody. But I reached out to Monica, and to, I never remember his name, the one who played Pete Seeger.” (That would beEdward Norton.) “We had a long conversation.” Would it be possible for her to reach out to Dylan herself? Baez’s answer is short: “No.” The now 84-year-old Baez moves slowly and smiles widely, the usual thousand bangles clanging on her wrists. The voice that sang “We Shall Overcome,” amid tear gas and marches on the bridges of Alabama, arrived in Milan recently to present her new book of poems and prose,When You See My Mother, Ask Her to Dance,before visiting the Milanesiana to have a dialogue withSandro Veronesi. Though her legendary vibrato is still powerful—she shares it at one point, singing a few lines fromJanis Ian’s “One in a Million”—Baez is done with live performance. “I don’t want to tour anymore,” she says. “Too tiring. The tour bus, the transfers—I can’t do it anymore. But writing? Writing is still a way to endure.” And to remember the past.A Complete Unknown,Baez says, is “not a documentary, it’s a movie. Some of it’s beautiful. The music was beautiful, and some of the acting. “I think she did a good job,” she adds, referring to Barbaro. “I thinkhedid a very good job. What’s his name? Chalamet. He just needed—he was too clean, probably.” Baez’s new book includes a poem dedicated to Jimi Hendrix—“I didn’t know him well”—and a focus on her own childhood. “Early in my life, drawing gave me my own identity and was soothing to me. And then it was early childhood trauma. It was abuse, sexual abuse, physical abuse. So all of my life, I had phobias, and I had troubles and anxiety, and I didn’t understand why. But I had good therapists. They helped me function, but the deep problems were still there.” Writing, then, provides her a different kind of therapy. Childhood is referenced in the book’s title. Baez also speaks of her father, physicist Albert Baez, who refused to work on the Manhattan Project for religious reasons. His influence led Baez to embrace civil disobedience. “I was raised Quaker,” she says. “It’s the only religion that seriously does not go to war. Everybody says ‘you shouldn’t kill anybody’—then they strap on the guns and they go and fight. And the Quakers really won’t do that. They say you can accept suffering, but you can’t inflict suffering.” It’s a viewpoint she wishes more people in power shared. When asked whether she anticipatedDonald Trump’s being elected president a second time, Baez replies, “No. But no matter what, nobody could have realized, nobody could write it. Nobody could dream it. What we have now is so fast and so destructive. We just can’t let it destroy the heart and the art.” “It’s impossible to imagine,” she continues. “It’s still impossible. Every day when you get up, something more disgusting has happened than the day before. And that’s really the best word. It’s disgusting, and it’s cruel. And the point of it is cruelty. The point of it’s to hurt people. The point of it is sadism.” What about music? Can it still change things? Maybe. But Baez thinks we desperately need a new anthem. “The strongest anthem ever was ‘We Shall Overcome.’ Everybody could sing it. And it gave us a feeling that we were together, and we were powerful.” Others have tried writing songs that have equal power, she says; some are even pretty good. But Baez also thinks “we will never have that 10-year period again of all of that talent,” which flourished in the 1960s. In the meantime, Baez writes poetry. And has crashed her newly bought Tesla. “Yes, I did,” she says to laughter. “God was speaking to me, because I got this car—literally, I was trying it out. I drove for 45 minutes, I drove home—boom:I backed into a big tree and it was destroyed.” Perhaps it was a sign. Original story inVFItaly.",

    "title": "The Still Vital—and Still Complicated—Legacy of Susan Brownmiller",
    "article_text": "I met Susan Brownmiller, the feminist pioneer, while researching a project about 1960s groups like New York Radical Women and Redstockings. We had both worked at theVillage Voice—she two decades before me—and Brownmiller welcomed me into her Greenwich Village aerie like I was a long lost niece, regaling me with tales of yore. There was her time spent in the civil rights movement as a summer volunteer in Mississippi, her illegal abortions and abortion protests, the disruptive occupation ofLadies Home Journalas a throwdown to a male-dominated media, the first rape speakout, which led to her groundbreaking, controversial 1975 bookAgainst Our Will: Men, Women and Rape. She talked about how the women’s liberationists faced opposition not just from the establishment but from macho progressive activists who ought to have been their allies. “Radical men didn't like the idea of women splitting off into their own groups,” she recalled with a sly grin. “Who was going to run the mimeograph machines? Or get the coffee?” When I heard she had died this week at the age of 90, I immediately pulled up the YouTubevideoof her 1970 appearance onThe Dick Cavett Show, in which she and fellowVoicewriter Sally Kempton took downPlayboyfounder Hugh Hefner with a perfect mixture of chutzpah and disdain. Clad in a no-nonsense beige pantsuit, Brownmiller announced, “Hugh Hefner is my enemy.” The 44-year-old publisher sat just a few feet away, suavely puffing on his pipe, doing his best to look unruffled. “The role you have selected for women is degrading,” Brownmiller said coolly of the Playboy bunnies with their cottontail rears and the cheesecake models in the magazine, “because you choose to see women as sex objects, not as full human beings.” Hefner tried to smooth the waters and meet Women’s Lib halfway, while standing up for vive le difference. “I’m more in sympathy than the girls realize,” Hefner assured the audience. “Women,” Brownmiller retorted, correcting Hefner’s use of the word “girls.” “Women. I am 35.” And she turned it right back on the aging swinger, asking sharply: “Do you want to be called aboy?” At a moment when many gains of the women’s movement are being reversed at warpspeed—when ever more draconian abortion laws means that abraindead womanin Georgia is being kept on life support until her fetus is viable, when the White House is aggressivelyerasingwomen’s achievements from the public record and attacking programs to increase workplace equality—the changes that Brownmiller fought for now seem miraculous. Brownmiller grew up in Brooklyn, the child of a lower-middle class Jewish family. A college dropout, she changed her name from Warhaftig to Brownmiller because she hoped to break into the theater. When the stage life didn’t pan out, she switched her sights to magazines but realized while working atNewsweekthat in the mainstream media, women writers like her wouldn’t be allowed to rise past researcher. So she became a freelance journalist, writing for places like theVoice. In fall 1968, she heard about a New York Radical Women meeting. That was the name of the group behind the disruption of the Miss America Pageant, most famous for a symbolic protest in which the female protesters hurled cosmetics in a trash can and—so the legend goes—burned their bras. That never actually happened, but the myth of the lingerie inferno went viral—a fictitious spark that ignited real outbreaks of women’s liberation across the world, while setting off alarm bells throughout the straight world. When Brownmiller arrived at the meeting for her first consciousness raising session a few months after the pageant, the room was packed. The topic was having children. As soon as her turn came around, Brownmiller found herself blurting out details of the three illegal abortions she’d had—one just six months before, in Puerto Rico. She had thought she was in control, but tears welled up in her eyes as she told the women she felt lucky to be alive. “I had never said this out loud before,” Brownmiller recalled. “That was the moment that I knew this women's movement was real.” She threw herself into the maelstrom and soon was testifying about her abortions as part of a massive class action abortion-relatedlawsuit—a precursor to Roe V Wade organized by activist lawyer Flo Kennedy. Kennedy saw the suit as not just “a legal action” but “an attempt to educate the public” about the need for abortion to be legalized. Brownmiller did just that. She talked about a doctor who wanted to experiment on her with a new method, asking her to sign blank pieces of paper that would absolve him of guilt in case the abortion went awry. At the start of 1970, women’s liberation remained a curiosity to most Americans. By the year’s end, the effects of the movement had seeped into every area of modern life. One of the most dramatic uprisings of the year unfolded within the media itself. Spurred by the impact of the Miss America protests, Brownmiller and a group called Media Women decided to stage a sit-in at theLadies’ Home Journal, a bastion of the counter-revolution since 1891, sedating its 14 million female readers with monthly columns like “Can This Marriage Be Saved?” On the morning of March 18, 1970, dozens of women’s liberation activists, dressed in office-appropriate dresses and heels, swarmed the inner sanctum of editor-in-chief John Mack Carter, laying siege for eleven hours. “Behave like ladies,” pleaded Lenore Hershey, Carter’s genteel deputy and gatekeeper. Instead, the invaders passed around a box of Carter’s cigars and smoked them. They hung a banner out the editor’s window proclaiming it THE WOMEN’S LIBERATED JOURNAL. NBC News captured the scene on tape, as dozens of women confronted Carter. “Do you women recognize one leader?” a magazine staffer asked, hoping for a less chaotic negotiation. “No!” the protesters shouted joyfully. Prior to the office invasion, Brownmiller and her comrades had compiled a list of demands to present to the magazine. Most major women’s periodical mastheads were still dominated by men, so they called for Carter, along with other top editors and staff writers, to be replaced by women. They also pressed for a daycare center for employees and the hiring of Black women at all levels. (At the time there were precisely zero on the staff). Their most audacious goal was to not just occupy the offices for a day, but to take over an entire issue of the magazine. Article ideas included \"How to Get An Abortion\" and “How To Have An Orgasm”—both verboten topics in the demure women’s magazines of the era. They even mocked up a magazine cover featuring a pregnant woman holding up a sign that read, “UNPAID LABOR.” Carter ultimately agreed to give them an 8-page magazine supplement that would be written and edited collectively. Among those working on the special section were Media Women member Nora Ephron, then a writer at theNew York Post. “[A]lternatingly fascinating, horrifying, and hilarious,” is how Ephron later described the fractious experience. After the sit-in, however,Ladies Homes Journalinstituted significant changes. Carter re-focused the existing “Power of a Woman” section to cover women’s liberation happenings and added a new monthly “Working Woman” column. And a few years later, Hershey took his place as editor in chief. Yet some felt disappointed by how few concessions they’d won from the magazine, and the underground newspaperRATaccused Brownmiller and her fellow journalists of using the action for personal gain, suggesting that they’d turned a guerrilla action into a job interview. Late in 1970, Brownmiller’s consciousness raising group began discussing the topic of rape. “Rape isn’t a feminist issue,” she insisted. Having never been assaulted herself, Brownmiller initially couldn’t see how any sensible woman could end up in such a situation. But her perspective changed completely as she listened to fellow members’ stories, and she decided to help the group plan a “rape speakout.” On a chilly January afternoon in a Hells Kitchen church, 30 women stood up to testify to an array of ordeals. The perpetrators ranged from trusted intimates (psychiatrists, husbands, boyfriends) to total strangers. The group followed the speakout a few months later with a full-scale “Rape Conference” featuring workshops and talks devoted to the law, social policy, medical issues, incest, and self-defense. Brownmiller attended on crutches: she’d sprained her ankle by kicking a guy on the street who pinched her while she was handing out conference flyers. Propelled by the momentum of the conference, Brownmiller launched herself into researching what would become the first major feminist study of rape,Against Our Will.“A nuts‐and‐bolts program for dragging rape laws into the 20th century” saidThe New York Times. It led toTimemagazine honoring Brownmiller as one of its twelve Women of the Year in 1975. But the book was also rightly critiqued by scholars like bell hooks and Angela Davis for its blindspots regarding race. While acknowledgingAgainst Our Willas a “pioneering scholarly contribution to the contemporary literature of rape,” Davis condemned it as a text “pervaded with racist ideas.” In a passage on Emmett Till, the Black teenager lynched in 1955 for whistling at a white woman in a Mississippi grocery store, Brownmiller described the boy’s whistle as a “deliberate insult just short of physical assault,” suggesting that black and white men alike see women as the white man’s property. Davis noted that in Brownmiller’s rendering, Till comes off looking “almost as guilty as his white racist murderers.” An unabashed and imperfect feminist heroine, Brownmiller continued to stir up controversy by making comments late in life that sounded like victim-blaming. “Culture may tell you, ‘You can drink as much as men,’ but you can’t….,” Brownmiller toldThe Cutin 2015. “The slut marches bothered me, too, when they said you can wear whatever you want. Well sure, but you look like a hooker. They say, ‘That doesn’t matter,’ but it matters to the man who wants to rape.” Throughout her career, some of Brownmiller’s fellow feminists resented her high profile status. Even as she was writingAgainst Our Will, Brownmiller recalls one of her cohorts asking her, “Why do you have to put yournameon your book? These ideas belong to the movement.” Which is why she brought her friend Sally Kempton onThe Dick Cavett Showwith her. When Cavett asked them if they rejected men, Brownmiller told him that she was more optimistic about the possibility of men changing than separatist feminists. Still, she said thoughtfully, “We think there’s going to be a struggle, and we don’t think that men are going to give up their power and privilege easily.” Brownmiller lived long enough to understand that in a war there can be setbacks, that ground gained can be reconquered, and that the struggle is still just beginning.

I know this will not only help me be more supportive of myself, but it will help my community support me effectively.\" Vesterberg, 30, is an art historian and often lectures in public. She also organizes events for brands including Tiffany & Co, something that by her own admission may seem unthinkable for a woman with autism to do. \"However, my doctor explained to me that many autistic women learn to mask or camouflage their differences, consciously mimicking social norms so effectively that others miss the signs. She told me that nearly 80% of autistic women remain undiagnosed at age 18. I write this in the hope that I can contribute to promoting a change in that statistic.\" Vesterberg concludes her article by thanking her family for the support she has received, particularly her husband, financier and collectorTimothy Vesterberg,whom she married five years ago at St. James's Chapel Royal, one of the palaces of the British royal family.

    "title": "Queen Camilla's Latest Rewear Nods to Meghan Markle and Prince Harry",
    "article_text": "King Charles IIIandQueen Camillahavearrived in Canada on an official and historic visit, not least because it is the first time they have flown to the country since ascending the throne in 2022. On Tuesday, Charles, who is Canada’s official head of state, will deliver a speech from the throne and formally open Parliament. This marks two important milestones, as a British monarch has not delivered “the speech from the throne” since 1977 and for 68 years no sovereign had opened a session of Parliament. It all comes with a new prime minister,Mark Carney, and in the wake of PresidentDonald Trump's suggestion Canada be the \"51st state\" of the United States. Trump has a special affection for the British royal family—saveMeghan MarkleandPrince Harry—with two visits to the U.K. planned in less than a year, one state visit and one semi-private visit. It may be that the presence of the royals in Canada will make him rethink his Canadian ambitions. King Charles III and Queen Camilla arriving at Macdonald-Cartier International Airport in Ottawa, Canada, May 26, 2025. For the occasion, Camilla wore a brooch alongside diamond and pearl earrings and a gold pendant engraved with the initials of her grandchildren: all of which elevated her pale pink coat-dress designed by Anna Valentine and complemented by Chanel shoes. She'd donned the dress for the May 2018 royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and this rewear could be a nod to the royal couple asthe Sussexes recently celebrated their seventh wedding anniversary. Doria Ragland, Prince Charles, Prince of Wales and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall after the wedding of Prince Harry and Ms. Meghan Markle at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle on May 19, 2018 in Windsor, England. Of the ensemble, her maple leaf brooch, the national symbol of Canada also catches the eye. The brooch if one that King George VI gave to his wife, Queen Elizabeth, to mark her first royal tour of Canada in the spring of 1939, a few months before the outbreak of World War II.The jewelryfirm Asprey made it in diamonds set in platinum in the late 1930s and the king acquired it for his wife who, judging by the number of times she wore it, was enthusiastic about the present. The brooch became something of a national symbol for Elizabeth during the conflict. She wore it, for example, when Eleanor Roosevelt visited London in October 1942, and many more times, including the day she received the Order of Canada at 100 years old. The King and Queen with Diana Fox Carney, Whit Fraser, Mark Carney, Mary Simon during the tree planting ceremony at the Governor of Canada's residence, Rideau Hall. The Queen Mother lent the brooch to her daughter, Elizabeth II. The first time, for her first trip to Canada, still as a princess, in 1951. In 2017, she retrieved it for a visit to Canada House in London for the 150th anniversary of Canadian Confederation when Elizabeth II was celebrating her Sapphire Jubilee. She received a gift that day: a snowflake-shaped sapphire and diamond brooch designed to accompany the diamond maple leaf. Elizabeth II would inherit the pin after her mother' s death in 2002, and, like her, wore it frequently, around the world. She also lent the brooch to both Camilla and Kate who took it to Canada on her first tour of the country in 2016 with Prince William. Upon Elizabeth II's death, the brooch, part of her jewelry collection, became part of her inheritance. Camilla borrowed it from her mother-in-law for her first visit to Canada as Duchess of Cornwall in 2009. The first time she wore it as consort was in 2024, posing for an official portrait as Queen of Canada.

    "title": "HBO’s Harry Potter TV Series: Everything We Know",
    "article_text": "The sorting hat ceremony for the three main roles in HBO’s upcomingHarry Potterserieshas been completed. On Tuesday, May 27, the networkannouncedthat the series has cast relative newcomersDominic McLaughlinas Harry Potter,Arabella Stantonas Hermione Granger, andAlastair Stoutas Ron Weasley. “After an extraordinary search led by casting directorsLucy BevanandEmily Brockmann, we are delighted to announce we have found our Harry, Hermione, and Ron,” series showrunner and executive producerFrancesca Gardiner,and fellow EPMark Mylod,who also directs multiple episodes, said in a joint statement. “The talent of these three unique actors is wonderful to behold, and we cannot wait for the world to witness their magic together onscreen.” While this marks Stout’s first major onscreen project, McLaughlin has two other upcoming screen projects—Gifted, a BBC action-adventure series about Scottish teens with superpowers, andGrow, a Sky comedy film co-starringBridgerton’sGolda Rosheuvel,Ted Lasso’sJeremy Swift, and his futureHarry Potterco-starNick Frost. Meanwhile, at only nine years old, Stanton made her West End debut playing the titular role of Matilda inMatilda: The Musical—a performance you cansee a bit of here. Last fall, HBO launched an open casting call for the main trio of young wizards—Harry, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger—that receivedover 30,000 submissions.“We would like to thank all the tens of thousands of children who auditioned,” Gardiner and Mylod continued. “It's been a real pleasure to discover the plethora of young talent out there.” HBO is describing the show as a “faithful adaptation” of the best-selling book series byJ.K. Rowling, which spawned eight hit films between 2001 and 2011, as well as a spin-off franchise,Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,and an ongoing Broadway play,Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.“Exploring every corner of the wizarding world, each season will bringHarry Potterand its incredible adventures to new and existing audiences,” the official series description continues. Despite hercontroversialremarks about trans people,Rowling will serve as an executive producer on the new project and is expected tocollaborate with Gardinerto adapt her books for TV. Ahead, everything we know about the upcomingHarry Potterseries—from who else is in the cast to what Warner Bros. has said about Rowling’s involvement. In mid-April, it wasannouncedthat, aspreviously reported,thatJohn Lithgow, who starred in recent best-picture nomineeConclaveand won an Emmy for playing Winston Churchill onThe Crown, has been cast as Albus Dumbledore, headmaster of Hogwarts. The role was previously played by Irish actor Richard Harris, who died in 2002 after appearing in the first twoHarry Potterfilms and was replaced by Michael Gambon, who laterdied in 2023.Lithgowconfirmed his castingback in February: “It came as a total surprise to me,” the 79-year-old actor said at the time. “I just got the phone call up at the Sundance Film Festival for yet another film, and it was not an easy decision because it’s going to define me for the last chapter of my life, I’m afraid.” Janet McTeer, a two-time Oscar-nominated actor, will play no-nonsense transfiguration professor Minerva McGonagall, who was previously portrayed bythe late Maggie Smith.Paapa Essiedu, who earned an Emmy nomination for HBO’sI May Destroy Youhas been cast as enigmatic potions professor Severus Snape, a role originated by Alan Rickman, who died in 2016. AndShaun of the Deadstar Nick Frost rounds out the series-regular cast as beloved groundskeeper Rubeus Hagrid, played by Robbie Coltrane in the original movies beforehis 2022 death. Tapped for recurring roles in the series are West End theater actorLuke Thallonas defense against the dark arts professor Quirinus Quirrell (played byIan Hartin the films) and Welsh comedianPaul Whitehouseas Hogwarts caretaker Argus Filch (previously played byDavid Bradley). “We’re delighted to have such extraordinary talent on board, and we can’t wait to see them bring these beloved characters to new life,” Gardiner and Mylod said in a statement. So far,Daniel Radcliffeis the only main actor who has declared hewon’t returnas The Boy Who Lived in this iteration. “It seems to me that they are wanting to make a fresh series,” the actor toldEntertainment Tonightback in 2023, “which it feels like it’d be distracting to have old, haggard Harry also entering from stage left.” While Radcliffe is “certainly not seeking” a role in the show, he’s “very supportive” of those who will be passed the wizarding wand. “I wish particularly, obviously, the kids nothing but the best,” he said, adding, “I hope I get to meet them one day, I guess, and be, like, ‘Are you okay? How’s it going?’” Radcliffe’s reticence to board the new series may be partly owed to his now severed relationship withHarry Potterauthor J.K. Rowling. The actor has beenpublicly criticalof Rowling since hercontroversial remarks about trans peoplein 2020. “I’ve met so many queer and trans kids and young people who had a huge amount of identification with Potter,” he said in aninterview with IndieWire.“Seeing them hurt on that day, I was, like, I wanted them to know that not everybody in the franchise felt that way.” Rupert Grint,andEmma Watson,who played Ron and Hermione in the original films, have alsospoken out against Rowling,leading the author to make veiled jabs years later. Last month, sheseemingly addressed the tensionsbetween herself and that trio on social media in a response to a post that asked: “What actor/actress instantly ruins a movie for you?”Rowling wrote: “Three guesses. Sorry, but that was irresistible,” adding three laughing emojis. When plans for the new series wereunveiledin April 2023, Rowling said in a statement: “Max’s commitment to preserving the integrity of my books is important to me, and I’m looking forward to being part of this new adaptation which will allow for a degree of depth and detail only afforded by a long-form television series.” HBO CEOCasey Bloyswaved off Rowling’s off-screen reputation during the official announcement of the series. “That’s a very online conversation, very nuanced and complicated, and not something we’re going to get into,” he said. “Our priority is what’s onscreen. Obviously, the Harry Potter story is incredibly affirmative and positive and about love and self-acceptance.” Last November, Bloysconfirmedthat Rowling remained “fairly involved.” “I imagine she’ll have opinions on casting,” he added. “It hasn’t affected the casting or hiring of writers or production staff or anything, so we haven’t felt any impact from that.” An official release date has yet to be conjured, but the series isexpectedto begin filming this summer. Whileinitial reportssaid that each of the seven main books would be adapted into a season of the show, Bloyshas saidthat he envisions the project running “for 10 consecutive years.” That extended timeline is “why it’s been such a hard decision,” says Lithgow, who would be well in his octogenarian years at the show’s conclusion. “I’ll be about 87 years old at the wrap party. But I’ve said yes.” This post will be updated. The UnsinkableKathy Bates Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years.

    "title": "Ted Bundy, Charles Manson, and Gary Ridgway Once Breathed the Same Poisoned Air. Did It Make Them Killers?",
    "article_text": "The Pacific Northwest is known for five things: lumber, aircraft, tech, coffee, and crime. Weyerhaeuser, Boeing, Microsoft, Starbucks, and serial killers. Every decade, the headlines. “Why Are There So Many Serial Killers in the Northwest?” There is no answer. There are just numbers. Per capita, Alaska is number one in the country, Washington five, Oregon six. “America’s killing fields,” it has been called, the home of the stranger, the lone wolf, the neighbor who’s a little too quiet. For some it’s a hobby. For others, a career. They have their own brands, but they’re all different. The Want‑Ad Killer, the Boxcar Killer, the Lust Killer, the Phantom Sniper, the Hillside Strangler, the Lewiston Valley Killer, the I‑5 Killer, the Coin Shop Killer, the Dismemberment Murders, the Index Killer, the Happy Face Killer, the Eastside Killer, the Werewolf Butcher of Spokane. The Beast of British Columbia. The Green River Killer. Weirdly, many of them are born in the same period, shortly before, during, or after World War II. Amateur cartographer, I draw lines, making maps tied to timelines, maps of rural roads and kill sites and body dumps. Some of the maps are in my mind. I always consider the location of the scene of the crime. In a chaotic world, maps make sense. There are people who have gurus or crystals or graven images. I have maps. They tell a story. They make connections. Here’s one of my maps: It’s August of 1961. I’m seven months old. There are three males who live in what you might call the neighborhood, within a circle whose center is Tacoma. Their names are Charles Manson, Ted Bundy, and Gary Ridgway. What are the odds? In 1961, Manson is twenty-­six, serving a ten-­year sentence in the federal prison on McNeil Island for forging a United States Treasury check. McNeil Island lies in Puget Sound, off the city of Tacoma. Across the Sound, eight miles from Manson, Ted Bundy is fourteen, living at 658 North Skyline Drive, next to the approach to the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. Gary Ridgway is twelve, residing north of Tacoma at 4404 South 175th Street, near SeaTac Airport, an address then considered to be in Seattle. Eight years later, on August 9, 1969, Manson, gathering his followers, will urge them to murder everyone at 10050 Cielo Drive in Benedict Canyon on a night that will become a byword for inconceivable and random violence. The following night, they will kill Rosemary and Leno LaBianca. Sometime in the 1970s or early 1980s, Gary Ridgway will begin killing women he picks up near the airport, blocks from where he grew up. He strangles prostitutes, runaways, and teenage girls. Dozens of them. At first he dumps their bodies in rivers, their hair rippling in the stream flow. Until 2001, when he’s apprehended, he will be known to the public only as the Green River Killer. But in the early morning hours of August 31, 1961, the one who gets the ball rolling—the prodigy, the polymath, the boy wonder—is Ted Bundy. That night, rain lashes the windows, and I’m a baby in a basket, teething, seething, rubbing my hair off on a fuzzy yellow blanket. That night, during a thunderstorm, in a neighborhood he knows only too well, Ted Bundy climbs through the living room window of a family named Burr. He used to live right around the corner. He has friends who know the Burrs. He finds Ann Marie, who is eight, wearing a blue-­and-­white flowered nightie, two religious medals, and a bracelet invoking the protection of Saint Christopher. Pied Piper of Tacoma, he spirits her out the front door. She is never seen again. Now let’s look at the map. If you take a ruler and lay it down in 1961 and connect the dots between Charles Manson, Ted Bundy, and Gary Ridgway, you can practically draw a straight line. Is it chance? Is there a connection? Well, that’s the question. ‘Murderland’ by Caroline Fraser Penguin Random House Tacoma is famous for one thing: its smell. If Seattle is considered a remote backwater in the 1950s—and it is—then Tacoma, poor sister to the south, is even more remote, more philistine, beneath contempt. Tacoma is Seattle’s industrial flunky, the also‐ran, the perennial embarrassment. Its setting once bore the rich grandeur of the Northwest, framed by mountains, royal robes of evergreens trailing into the placid harbor of Commencement Bay. Before white men arrived, it was a natural oasis, but Tacoma’s forefathers took that charm and threw it away with both hands. In 1873, having commissioned a design by Frederick Law Olmsted laying out the town in a series of curvilinear terraces beautified with seven parks, city planners reacted with “a bemused blend of boosterism and dismay.” During a recession, they rejected Olmsted’s vision. Instead, the town on Commencement Bay, considered one of the five best natural harbors in the world, chooses industry at every turn, buoyed by a brief boom associated with the building out of the Northern Pacific Railway, battening on the smoke and stench of wood pulp and paper‐mills, lumberyards, oil refineries, chemical plants, rendering plants, sewage tanks, and smelters. Soon their waste and effluent and slag heaps 33N are strewn beside the bay and across the Tacoma tidal flats like offal dropped from a raptor’s nest. Fifty‐three industrial plants are invited to squat there, in the center of the city, and the smell of decomposition and putrefaction and acidification, a stew of sulfur, chlorine, lye, and ammonia, suffuses the air. The staggering odor is called, as early as 1901, “the aroma of Tacoma.” Year after year, lead is flying out of the American Smelting and Refining Company's Tacoma smokestack, part of the industrial process of turning raw ores into metal. What is lead? It is a poison, second in toxicity only to arsenic. It is a chemical element bearing the atomic number 82 and the symbol Pb, from the Latin plumbum. In its solid phase, it is a shiny gunmetal gray, excruciatingly heavy. It 33N burns with a white flame. It’s resistant to corrosion. It never disappears. It enters the world in many ways, including but not limited to “oil‐processing activities, agrochemicals, paint, smelting, mining, refining, informal recycling of lead, cosmetics, peeling window and door frames, jewelry, toys, ceramics, pottery, plumbing materials and alloys, water from old pipes, vinyl mini‐blinds, stained glass, lead‐glazed dishes, firearms with lead bullets, batteries, radiators for cars and trucks, and some colors of ink.” Lead is a vampire. Invite it in and it will drink your blood and live forever. It tastes sweet. Chemically, it resembles calcium and is taken up rapidly in the bodies of children as their bones are forming. In ancient Rome, where winemakers boiled their grapes in great vats lined with lead for added sweetness, the diets of Nero and Caligula were rich in lead.62 In Tacoma, decade after decade, it rises out of the smokestack, dust drifting and settling where it may—north, south, east, and west. The unwitting populace breathes it, eats it, drinks it, and becomes it. When Louise and her son Ted Nelson arrive in Tacoma, they stay with her uncle John Cowell, three years her elder. John and Louise lived and played together as children. John is the social climber of the Cowell family. During World War II, he was seriously injured in a stateside training accident, preventing him from serving overseas. He recovered in time to earn bachelor’s and master’s degrees in music at Yale, marrying an heiress and encountering such musical stars as Leonard Bernstein and Paul Hindemith. In 1948 he accepted a position he felt was beneath him, at the School of Music of the College of Puget Sound, in Tacoma. In his memoir he’ll write: The Seattle‐Tacoma region was admittedly in the “minor leagues” musically, compared with the New York orbit we were so at home in. But it came to allow me to develop naturally as a composer and performer with freedom from the anxieties of the “big time” New York pressures. That tinge of self‐satisfaction, pride in a former “New York orbit,” will thoroughly impress young Teddy, and his status as poor relation will be impressed upon him by his cousin, the Cowells’ young son John, six months Ted’s elder. The Cowells live at 1514 North Alder Street in Tacoma, a modest two‐story frame house just across the street from the college campus. Louise and Ted eventually move to a place in Browns Point, a nub of land on the far side of Commencement Bay, directly across from Ruston and the smelter. He is four, he is five, and the smokestack is filling the air with redolent particulates while he hunts for frogs in the local swamps. “I was somewhat of a champion frog catcher,” he’ll later say. “I was a frog man. Prided myself on my ability to spot that pair of bulging eyes, which would bob just above the surface of a murky pond.” While Teddy is marinating in Browns Point, Louise finds an office job as a secretary and dips her toe in the dating pool, attending a First Methodist Church social. There she meets another displaced soul struggling to make his way in the city, Johnnie Culpepper Bundy, an orphan from a backwoods North Carolina farm, one of a family of ten. Before Johnnie was a teen, his mother died and his father followed, drowning himself in the Pasquotank River in 1934, at the age of forty‐eight. In the 1940s, Johnnie did what dirt‐poor orphans from North Carolina usually did: he joined the Navy. After the war, he washed up out west, adrift in the turbid waters of Tacoma. Johnnie met Louise in 1951 and fastened upon her like a limpet. They married within months, on May 19, 1951, and Teddy stuck his hand in the wedding cake. Teddy doesn’t like his new stepfather, who has a dorky Nash Rambler, a clown car, and works as a cook at the Fort Lewis military hospital, south of town. Nonetheless, Johnnie adopts the boy, who, in his larval stage, morphs into Ted Bundy. Teddy notes that Johnnie is passive, with little to say, deferring to Louise. Teddy prefers his uncle John, who drives foreign cars. He wants to be adopted by John Cowell and leave his mother behind; he wants to live with Roy Rogers and have his own pony; he wears a cowboy hat and a sweater appliquéd with bucking broncos, every button buttoned. In 1953, Teddy’s seventh year of life, 630 tons of arsenic and a couple hundred tons of lead pour out of the Ruston stack.66 No one knows it yet, but that’s more airborne arsenic than anywhere else in the country. It’s one of the largest sources of arsenic emissions in the world. That same year, the Bundys move to the Skyline neighborhood, all of them packed into a tiny cracker box of a house beside State Highway 16, which feeds traffic onto the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. The bridge has been rebuilt and painted with lead‐based paint. Over the coming years, Louise has first one child, then another and another. Displaced by Bundy babies, Teddy joins the Boy Scouts and bicycles all over Tacoma, skimming through back alleys like a common tern, hovering outside windows, picking through garbage. He gets teased because of a mild speech impediment. At scout camp, he can’t get the hang of what the other kids are doing, can’t tie the knots right, can’t shoot the gun straight, and can’t win the races. He gets angry and likes to scare people. His elementary teachers note “boisterous” and “immature” behavior. He is ten, he is eleven. He has a paper route and a pocketknife and slashes the seats of an expensive convertible. He hits a fellow scout over the head with a stick from behind. He is found undressed in a tent with a scoutmaster. He runs up behind girls and pulls their pants down and likes to build “tiger traps” in the woods with his friends—pits covered with vegetation that hide sharpened sticks poking up from the bottom. He never lives farther than five miles from the smokestack. Skyline is a new development. The city’s population is burgeoning as tens of thousands of postwar hopefuls are drawn by jobs in the railyards, mills, and smelters. South of the bridge, as old‐growth forest is clear‐cut, Skyline is bulldozed out of the “cut‐over stump land,” as the smelter manager puts it, and carved into minuscule lots.73 The manager tries to convince the city fathers not to turn Skyline into a human warren. The proposed suburban development, he warns, is just four miles south of the Ruston smelter. It lies, he says, “in the heart of our smoke stream” and is “our area of greatest fumigation.” He knows that people will complain about the smell, for starters. And they do. But it’s not just the smell. For decades, nothing grows reliably, not trees, not the Douglas firs that spring up everywhere else like grass, not shrubs, not roses, not lawns. Gardens fail; crops die; bees die. Strange spots appear on the laundry, hung to dry on the line. Small farmers sue. Every few years, the smelter “blows out” the smokestack, an expectorant form of industrial housecleaning, causing “arsenic showers.” When the smelter coughs, white ash falls all across town, snow made of lead and arsenic. Cats and dogs walk in it and try to lick it off their paws and collapse and die. It is known that smelter officials will pay a few dollars to replace them. Children have trouble breathing. They develop coughs and rashes and asthma. These are the diseases that can be seen. The diseases that cannot be seen are different. These diseases constitute a category called the “late effects of lead poisoning on mental development,” caused by infants breathing leaden air or chewing little flakes of lead paint off walls or the slats of their cribs or inhaling invisible particles out of the air or off windowsills or the steps to their homes. The late effects include “cruel, unreliable, impulsive behavior” and “extreme unpredictability” and have been documented since at least the 1920s, when a physician wrote, with alarm, that children were living “in a lead world.” There’s lead in the air, in soil, in paint, in pipes, in water, toys, food, and milk, but there are no federal standards governing lead levels in products, in the environment, or in the blood or bones of children. The late effects of lead poisoning on children’s moods and behavior stem from “gross evidence of cerebral damage.” These children act out. They are said to be “crazy‐like.” They are irritable, nervous, inattentive, slow to learn. They have short attention spans. Sometimes they scream and bang their heads. Sometimes they set fires. Sometimes they wet the bed. They have dreams “bordering on hallucinations.” One boy, at six, sticks a fork into another boy’s face, steals pencils and pens, and sets his apartment on fire twice. Lead can be seen in X‐rays—deposited on the margins of children’s long bones or in opaque flakes of paint in their intestines—or in a blue‐tinged “lead line” in their gums. Lead can be measured in human blood in micrograms per deciliter. (A deciliter is a little less than half a cup.) In a child, blood lead levels of 125 micrograms per deciliter can cause acute swelling of the brain (encephalopathy) and death; over 80, kidney failure; over 60, stomach spasms; over 20, anemia and neuropathy. Levels around 10 may be responsible for the loss of nine or ten IQ points. There is no safe level of lead in the body, especially for children. Industry and its spokesmen are quick to blame poor parenting for kids who eat paint, but it’s not that simple. A major culprit emerges: leaded gas. Leaded gas fumes drift through the Skyline neighborhood of Tacoma, where the Bundy family is perched right beside Highway 16, the busy roadway yards from their home, but it’s nothing compared with the fumes and particulates from the Ruston smokestack. Much of Tacoma, with a population approaching 150,000, will record high lead levels in neighborhood soils, but the Bundy family lives near a string of astonishingly high measurements of 280, 340, and 620 parts per million. 91 Lead occurs naturally in soil at trace levels of no more than fifteen to forty parts per million. In June 1961, Charlie Manson, a pimp, a thief, a violator of the Mann Act (transporting prostitutes across state lines), and a disciple of Dale Carnegie, is transferred to the federal penitentiary on McNeil Island, across from South Tacoma in the nether reaches of Puget Sound. Born to a fifteen‐year‐old girl, he has spent his first years in a mining town in West Virginia, product of broken homes, reform schools, and institutions. He never knew his father. Now twenty‐six, he spends his days at McNeil sitting in a five‐tier cellblock listening to the radio and studying Scientology and learning to play the guitar and writing songs and breathing the air from the Ruston smokestack. McNeil Island is proudly self‐sustaining. Prisoners drink water from a well, grow crops, and tend a dairy herd, producing most of the food they eat. During his five years on the island, virtually everything Manson eats and drinks comes out of the earth, where particulates from the Ruston plume have been drifting down to the ground since 1890. He’ll live on McNeil Island longer than he’s lived in any place in his life. Later studies on McNeil find lead in soil ranging from a low of nineteen parts per million to a high of a 190. Helter smelter. A few miles north of Tacoma, young Gary Ridgway is also growing up in the plume. Before settling there, his itinerant family has moved all over the Intermountain West, and his older brother fondly recalls playing with Gary “in the slag pile from a copper mine” in Idaho. The Ridgways live two miles east of the Seattle‐Tacoma International Airport (SeaTac). That area, in addition to the Ruston plume, suffers powerful secondary exposures, trapped as it is between two of the most heavily traveled north–south routes in the region, Pacific Highway South (old Highway 99) and Interstate 5. The prevailing wind blows inland from the west, sweeping highway and jet fuel fumes across the neighborhood. Airplanes are flying on leaded gas. There is no lead limit for aircraft, but most mixes contain around three grams of lead per gallon, higher than the 1.10 grams in gasoline sold for cars and trucks. In 1960, annual lead emissions from the Tacoma smokestack are estimated at 226 tons. In the summer of 1961, Gary is twelve and wets the bed. He is said to be “slow” and is held back a grade. “I wasn’t learning good enough,” he’ll later say. His mother, who has a habit of going about scantily clad and sunbathing nude in the backyard, scrubs his genitals to punish him for bedwetting, and he finds himself beset by hallucinatory fantasies, simultaneously dreaming of having sex with his mother and of slitting her throat with a kitchen knife. His father drives buses but works part time in a mortuary and relishes telling his family about a co‐worker who has sex with corpses. On August 31, 1961, the number one hit song in America is “Wooden Heart,” a song recorded the previous year by Elvis Presley, adapted from a German folk song. It has a pronounced oompah rhythm, accompanied by accordion. Elvis sings some of it in the original German, some in English, begging his lover to treat him good, because “I’m not made of wood / And I don’t have a wooden heart.” For Pinocchio, for any puppet yearning to be a real boy, it is the perfect anthem. In the heart of our smoke stream, Teddy is the boy with a wooden heart, a leaden heart, who goes out before dawn, working his paper route on his bicycle, escaping the house where his mother is heavily pregnant with the fourth Bundy baby. He rides and rides and ends up at the Burr house, just around the corner from where he used to live. He has lately been prone to violent daydreams and night visions of an extreme sexual nature, fantasies and nocturnal emissions, strangulation married to ejaculation. He has seen exciting things in the true crime detective magazines at the drugstore, in the pornography in other peoples’ trash, and perhaps in his grandfather’s potting shed, long ago. But seeing is not believing. He wants to act it out. He is fourteen. He rides and rides in the dark night of August 31, peering into windows. The Burrs’ living room window is cracked open, to allow the TV antenna to snake outside. He drags a little bench over to the window and stands on it, pushing the sash up, leaving a footprint on the bench and another in a flowerbed beside the basement door, the imprint of a teenager’s tennis shoe. The Burrs live on North 14th Street, around the corner from where his uncle John once lived. Next door to the Burrs’ Tudor bungalow is old Mrs. Gustafson’s orchard, a maze of apple trees and raspberry bushes, frequented by neighborhood children. That summer, the street is upended by sewer construction: down the block yawn thirty‐foot‐deep trenches full of mud and rainwater. The Burr family is troubled that night. Eight‐year‐old Ann is sharing a bedroom with three‐year‐old Mary, who has a cast on her arm after falling off a playground slide. Mary keeps waking up because it is warm and humid. A half an inch of rain is falling. For the past few nights, Ann’s parents have thought they heard someone prowling in the yard. In the middle of the night, Mary starts crying: the skin under her cast is itching. Ann takes Mary to their mother, Bev. Bev shushes them and sends them back to bed. Their cocker spaniel Barney barks and barks, but Bev thinks that it’s the wind and the rain. It’s not the wind and the rain. It’s more than likely Ted Bundy, the paperboy, leaning in the living room window, asking Ann to open the front door, offering a combination of whispered persuasion or temptation or promises or threats that will never be known. Ann idolizes teenage boys and has a crush on one, calling him “lover boy.” She’s pals with a girl named Sandi Holt. Sandi’s older brother Doug is Ted’s best friend. She leaves the door ajar as she goes, and her mother will find it standing open in the morning. Ted leads her into Mrs. Gustafson’s orchard and, although no one will ever confirm exactly what happens there, he may well rape her and strangle her and throw her body like a rag into a pool of water at the bottom of a construction trench. Later he will deny it but admit that, the summer he was fourteen, “something happened.” It was something “autoerotic,” he will say, something that involved an eight‐year‐old girl. Oh, and one other thing. She’s still down there.

    "title": "Lindsay Lohan Is Moving On From the Netflix Rom-Com: “I Can’t Do Movies Like These Forever”",
    "article_text": "After reachingteen stardomin the 2000s,Lindsay Lohanspent some time away from mainstream Hollywood, making her return with a trio of Netflix romantic comedies:2022’sFalling for Christmasand2024’sIrish WishandOur Little Secret.In a newEllecover story, Lohan shared that she was “manifesting” her comeback during the pandemic: “I was like, I want to work with Netflix. I kept writing it in my journal and saying it. And then that’s what happened. I was like, Oh, it’d be nice to do three films with them, and then see where that goes.” But while the 38-year-old actor always wants to front films “that make people happy and bring people together,” she is finally through with Netflix romantic comedies, at least for the moment. “I love making movies for that reason—for people to escape and find something that they can take into their own life and realize everything’s going to be okay,” Lohan told the publication. “But with Netflix, I was like, Okay, now we need to be thinking about other stuff. I can’t do movies like these forever.” Next up, Lohan stars inFreakier Friday—out August 8—a sequel to 2003’sFreaky Fridaythat reunites her with costarJamie Lee Curtis.“There’s not a lot bringing me to the movie theaters personally right now. [Freakier Friday] is a feel-good movie, which is what I want to give people,” said Lohan, who also relished getting to share the experience with her husband, financierBader Shammas,and her son,Luai.“I mean, it’s the most important thing—my husband, my son, and me. It’s all about balance and, as I said, routine,” she toldSaturday Night Live’sChloe Finemanin theElleinterview. “Especially when you have a kid, routine is the most important thing. And whatever their routine is, I’ve got to live by that.” Lohan said she’s now ready to switch up her day-to-day bywelcoming a second child. “Once you have one kid, you’re like, Oh, my kid needs a kid to play with. I’m like, He needs a friend…. Also, I don’t know if it’s selfish—but I’m like, I need more than one kid to take care of me when I’m older.” Speaking of aging, Lohan also revealed that she’s developing her own beauty line and shared some of her own secrets to looking fresh-faced—from drinking lemon juice and using daily eye patches to undergoing skin care treatments likeMorpheus8(Lohan only tried it once) and injections: “Everyone does Botox.” As for the next phase of her career, Lohan will be starring in a Hulu adaptation ofSophie Stava’s debut novel,Count My Lies,Ellereports, and has some ideas for what might follow. “I would love to find a dark comedylikeMean Girls.That kind of meaty, good, funny movie—a smart comedy. Not a rom-com, just a straightforward funny movie,” she said. “I’d love to work with some dream directors. MaybeQuentin Tarantino.Also, I’d love to work withJulianne Moore—I don’t know why I’ve never played her daughter. Maybe now I’d be her younger sister. I’d also love to work withRobert De NiroandAl Pacino.Maybe somethingSopranos-y, since I am Italian.” The UnsinkableKathy Bates Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years.

    "title": "The Billionaire Behind Wes Anderson’s Films: Who Is Steven Rales?",
    "article_text": "Afterscreening at the Cannes Film Festival,The Phoenician Schemearrives in theaters on Friday—the latest film byWes Anderson.As usual, the Oscar winner has assembled an outstanding ensemble cast that includesBenicio del Toro,Mia Threapleton, Michael Cera, Riz Ahmed, Tom Hanks, Bryan Cranston, Mathieu Amalric, Jeffrey Wright,andScarlett Johansson,among others. This marks Anderson’s fourth feature film in the last seven years, followingIsle of Dogs, The French Dispatch,andAsteroid City,as well as a group of shorter Roald Dahl adaptations that screenedcollectively on NetflixasThe Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Three More.It’s a prolific output, particularly at a time when idiosyncratic creators like Anderson can have difficulty securing financing and distribution. Anderson’s films tend to cost around $25 million or $30 million each, and tend to gross around double that—or slightly less. (Asteroid Citysurpassed $53 million at the worldwide box office, andThe French Dispatchearned $46 million, according toBox Office Mojo.) Anderson’s projects are generally financially viable, though his track record includes both major hits (the nearly $173 million–grossingGrand Budapest Hotel) and some resounding failures (Fantastic Mr. Fox,which earned acclaim but did not reach $60 million with a budget of $40 million). But unlike some other creators, Anderson will likely keep getting opportunities to make solidly mid-budget films regardless of how they perform at the box office—thanks to his association withSteven Rales,one of the richest independent film investors in the world. Rales has a net worth of $7.6 billion,according toForbes,and is ranked 468th inBloomberg’s index of billionaires. Others with big fortunes also invest in independent films, such asJeff Bezos,who does so indirectly through Amazon MGM Studios. But Rales’s case is exceptional because he alsoworks as a produceron the films he helps finance. Anderson, Jason Schwartzman, Rales and Bill Murray. Rales has financed all of Anderson’s films since 2007’sThe DarjeelingLimited,and has been a full-fledged producer on each one since 2012’sMoonrise Kingdom.He supervises and manages the projects, and is present during their shoots. When Anderson finally won an Oscar last year—best short film forThe Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar—Rales, as the project’s executive producer, won the award as well. But neither was present at the Dolby Theatre because they were filmingThe Phoenician Schemein Europe at the time. “Unfortunately, Steven and I are in Germany, and we start shooting our new movie early tomorrow morning. So I did not actually receive the award [in person],” Anderson explainedvia a statement. Who is Steven Rales, and how did he amass his great wealth? Born in 1951 in Bethesda, Maryland, he is the son of a wealthy businessman. In the late 1970s, he left his father’s real estate business and founded a new conglomerate with his brother,Mitchell:Danaher(originally called Equity Group Holdings). Through it, they have acquired and founded several companies in various sectors; currently, they are especially focused on science and technology as applied to health. Over time, Rales has diversified his investments. He has put more than $525 million into the NBA, specifically into the Indiana Pacers, a team in which he has a 20% stake (and which is a strong candidate for a ring this year; right now it’s competing in the Eastern Conference finals against the New York Knicks). Rales’s adventure in film began in 2006 when he founded Indian Paintbrush, a production company that finances independent (and generally risky) films. In addition to backing Anderson’s work, he has stood behind the Duplass brothers’Jeff, Who Lives at Home;Jason ReitmanandDiablo Cody’sYoung Adult;andSopranoscreatorDavid Chase’s feature debut,Not Fade Away,among others. His most successful and award-winning project so far, besidesThe Grand Budapest Hotel,has been last year’sConclave. Rales has not stopped there. Through Indian Paintbrush, last year heacquired Criterion, the benchmark for restoring, preserving, and releasing classic and contemporary films of great artistic value. The acquisition also involved Criterion’s sister distributor, Janus Films, which for almost 70 years has been bringing the North American public closer to the work of great international masters such as Michelangelo Antonioni, Sergei Eisenstein, Ingmar Bergman, Federico Fellini, and Akira Kurosawa. Lately, the company has supported that work by distributing films such asDrive My Carand the Latvian animated marvelFlow—which, along withConclave,helped Rales touched more Oscar gold this year. Rales is arousing increasing curiosity in the industry:The Hollywood Reporterdevotedan extensive profileto him last February. Though the trade tried to gain access to him, for the moment, Rales refuses to grant interviews or speak publicly about his role as producer. Instead, his great beneficiary, Wes Anderson, spoke on his behalf in a statement toTHR:“Over the years, Steven has become more and more and more crucial to me and my own filmmaking process on a day-to-day basis. On the set (and before and after),” he said. “He understands from long and wide experience how to manage and guide a team on a large scale, and he always thinks very long-term, which is rare and valuable. He’s with me from the start—and when there’s a problem, he solves it.” Original story inVFSpain.",

    "title": "Jessica Biel Kills Again in ‘The Better Sister’",
    "article_text": "Jessica Bielhas alreadystabbed a man to deathfor mysterious reasons and (allegedly)murdered her neighbor. In her latest TV series, she’s playing another troubled woman: a high-profile media executive who may or may not have killed her husband. “When you line ’em up like that, it’s like, Okay, what is wrong with you? What is your problem?’” says Biel with a slight smirk. But the reality is that the actor isfinallygetting a chance to dig into interesting, challenging roles, playing women who are harboring secrets and turmoil beneath their pristine surfaces. Her latest project,The Better Sister,an adaptation of a popular 2019 novel, centers on Biel’s Chloe—who lives a seemingly perfect life with her lawyer husband and her son. But after the husband (Corey Stoll) is brutally murdered in their home, Chloe’s estranged sister (Elizabeth Banks) comes to town, and their long-hidden family secrets bubble to the surface. Hitting Prime Video on May 29,The Better Sisteris a gripping mystery built around Biel’s performance as a woman who appears perfectly poised, before Biel slowly peels back her layers. “I just felt interested in this complicated woman who had this past she wanted to hide, and had all these big secrets,” she tellsVanity Fair.“I’m curious about humans who make really weird choices in moments of chaos, and in moments of extreme violence.” Biel, who first broke out on the TV series7th Heaven,spent decades on the big screen, appearing in films likeThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Illusionist,andTotal Recall.But her latest chapter has been her most interesting, as she and her production company have helped produce gripping whodunnit television shows including 2019’sLimetown,2021’sCruel Summer,and 2022’sCandy(starring Biel as one of her many murderers). These small-screen dramas have allowed Biel to reveal her many colors and stand at the center of a story—an opportunity she’s been waiting for her whole career. “For so long, I really didn’t have the opportunity to play any parts like this. I was not really getting those chances,” she says. “So I think I was just making up for some lost time.” Biel was just 14 when she was cast in the TV series7th Heaven.She starred on the wholesome drama about a Protestant minister, his wife, and their seven kids as sweet eldest daughter Mary Camden. After the fourth season (and aslight scandalwhen she did a racy photoshoot forGearmagazine), Biel ended up leaving the show early to attend Tufts University in Massachusetts, appearing only occasionally on the hit show for the remainder of its 11-season run. Still, Biel appeared in 134 episodes of7th Heavenaltogether—spending many of her teen years making the show. Maybe that’s why, for years, she thought she’d never return to TV. “When I was coming up in this business, you were either a television actor or a film actor, you very rarely did a crossover,” she says. Biel saysFriendsstarJennifer Anistonwas one of the few examples of an actor who successfully bounced between the big and small screen. “She was my idol,” says Biel. “I was like, Oh my God, if only I could do this the way she’s doing it.” After she headlined the 2003 remake ofThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre,Hollywood suddenly saw Biel in a new light. “I jumped into a whole genre different than anything you’d ever seen me do before, and I feel like that was probably what got people to stop thinking about me as just a kid who was on TV,” she says. For years afterward, she focused on her movie career, doing big-budget projects like 2004’sBlade: TrinitywithWesley Snipes;ensemble comedies like 2010’sValentine’s Dayand 2011’sNew Year’s Eve;and independent films like 2013’sThe Truth About Emanuel and 2016’sA Kind of Murder.“I was like, I’m never going back to television, ever. I’m never doing that,” she says. Then her business partnerMichelle Purpleasked Biel to consider the streaming world. New platforms had opened up new opportunities; she wanted their production company, Iron Ocean, to consider developing stories for television. “I literally was like, ‘You are out of your mind. I’m never going back to television. I told you that,’” Biel remembers saying. But Biel eventually changed her tune. She and Purple began developingThe Sinner,an anthology named forPetra Hammesfahr’s 1999 novel, which inspired the first season. That initial season series starredBill Pullmanas a detective trying to figure out why a woman (Biel) had stabbed a man to death in broad daylight. The USA Network show debuted to critical acclaim and strong ratings, and earned Biel nominations at the Golden Globes and Emmys. The network renewed the show for three more seasons, and finally put some momentum behind Biel’s production company. “I was super nervous about it. I was like, I hope this doesn’t end my career,” she says. “It was just new, how we were experiencing television was so different from what I knew growing up.” Biel next developed the seriesLimetown,in which she played a journalist investigating the disappearance of 300 people from a facility in Tennessee. The show, which also starredStanley Tucci,was gripping and interesting; unfortunately, it was also hosted on the short-lived streaming platform Facebook Watch. “Literally while we were editing the show, they called us and they were like, ‘Yeah, so, we’re not doing scripted content anymore,’” says Biel. “So it didn’t get any marketing, and just disappeared.” Her production company found better success with its followups, including Freeform'sCruel Summer—a mystery series about a girl's disappearance in the 90s – andCandy—a miniseries in which Biel starred as the infamous Candy Montgomery, who was accused of killing the neighbor who had an affair with Candy’s husband. “I changed as an artist. I just was like, ‘I'm not going to do things that I'm not interested in and I'm going to fight for the things that I really care about,’” she says. She cares aboutThe Better Sister, especially because she can relate to her character Chloe in an unexpected way. Chloe is a high-profile media figure who’s often covered in the press and stalked by paparazzi. But Biel has been in that spotlight for much longer than Chloe has. “I understand presenting an image. That's part of my job on some level. At least, it used to be when I was younger. That's what we were taught to do,” she says. “You have this outward image, and you need to maintain that image. Nobody wants to hear about your personal life, and nobody wants to know all those gross yucky details of how you're not this thing—so keep your mouth shut.” Biel says it’s different now than it was in the 90s when she rose to fame. Celebrities can be more open (and seemingly authentic) on social media. Still, she—and her husband,Justin Timberlake—can find the task challenging. “I know how to present in a certain way, and then be able to be a very different person home alone by myself,” she says. As the mother of two boys, Biel also easily related to Chloe’s desire to protect her son. “Being a mom, [I already had] that protective feeling that you would literally almost do anything that you had to do to assure that your kids are going to be safe,” she says. “So that was easy. That was already there for me.” She bonded quickly withMaxwell Acee Donovan, who plays Chloe's teenage son Ethan on the show, particularly since they're both originally from Boulder, Colorado. \"He's just got this openness about him. He's a really raw talent, I think,” she says. The Better Sisterwill keep audiences on the edge of their seats as they try to understand Chloe’s choices—both in her past and her present. But Biel was able to find empathy for her character. “That's really where it starts. I get why she's making these really bad decisions. I get it. I don't necessarily like it, but I have compassion for her. And once you get to that place, then the door's wide open.” It’s also wide open for Biel. She’s found a niche starring and producing these twisty mystery thrillers: “I just needed to get a little wiser and not care so much about what everyone else thought—what my industry thought about me—and just be like, ‘Whatever. I'm going to do my own thing,” she says. Still, it may be time to turn the page and see what other sandboxes she can play in. “I just love psychological drama thriller. It's just so fun as an artist to mess around,” she says. “I feel like I'm maybe creatively inspired to try something else. But I think I'll always just love this space.” The UnsinkableKathy Bates Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years.

    "title": "Outlander Prequel Blood of My Blood Unveils Two More Epic Love Stories",
    "article_text": "It was just another day in theOutlandercasting office when a young Scot namedJamie Roywalked through the door. He was auditioning for the rather unremarkable role of Militia Man Number Two on the hit Starz series’ seventh season. The part got cut prior to final casting. So Roy tried out for another character a few months later, but didn’t book the gig. “I was really gutted because I thought this was going to be my break,” Roy tellsVanity Fair. But theOutlanderproducers had far bigger plans for Roy. They were quietly developingOutlander: Blood of My Blood,a prequel about the parents ofCaitríona Balfe’s Claire Beauchamp—a World War II nurse transported back to mid-18th-century Scotland—andSam Heughan’s Jamie Fraser, the Highlander she falls for aftertraveling through time. As soon as they met Roy, the resemblance was clear: “We were like, ‘God, that guy looks a lot like Sam Heughan. That’s so crazy. Oh, do we save him [for the prequel]? But why are we saving him for something that we don’t even know is going to go?’” says executive producerMaril Davis,who has been onOutlandersince its 2014 debut. “I would’ve felt bad if the prequel hadn’t come. But we did decide to save him.” So, in what he calls “a wee bit” of an upgrade, Roy graduated from unnamed soldier to leading man. He stars onBlood of My Bloodas Brian Fraser, Jamie’s future father—who, like his son, has no interest in courting until he meets the right woman: Ellen Mackenzie (Pennyworth’sHarriet Slater), the headstrong eldest daughter of a rival clan. Although pursued by many a suitor, Ellen is too busy grieving her father (Peter Mullan) and navigating aSuccession-esque battle between her brothers Colum (Seamus McLean Ross) and Dougal (Sam Retford) to contemplate marriage. But Ellen’s familial loyalty is tested by her immediate attraction to Brian. Centuries later, Claire Beauchamp’s parents, Henry (Jeremy Irvine,who played a youngPierce BrosnaninMamma Mia! Here We Go Again) and Julia Moriston (Star WarsandMission: ImpossiblealumHermione Corfield) are facing their own set of odds. While fighting on the frontlines during World War I, Henry sends a letter from the battlefield that finds its way to Julia, who covertly responds to the correspondence while working at a postal censorship office. Though separated by thousands of miles, their love blooms. Premiering August 8 on Starz,Outlander: Blood of My Bloodretains much of the original show’s creative team, including executive producers Davis andRonald D. Moore,and showrunnerMatthew B. Roberts. Diana Gabaldon,author of the books that spawned the initial show, is also involved as a writer. But the new series isn’t inspired by any novels—which Davis sees as an opportunity. “With prequels, the challenge is you know exactly where you’re ending. But we have a lot of freedom in figuring out how to get there,” she says. “We don’t have a book series on this one, so we’re definitely not going to have that debate necessarily of, ‘Oh, this was in the book this way, but the show’s doing it a different way.’ But sometimes it’s nice to have the blueprint.” Another hurdle: The originalOutlanderisn’t over yet. The sweeping period romance has run for seven seasons, with an eighth and final chapter still to come. Viewers don’t need to be totally caught up with its parent series to appreciateBlood of My Blood,but Easter eggs abound for those who are in the loop. See, for instance, the character of Murtagh Fitzgibbons Fraser, played on the original series byDuncan LaCroix.Here, he’s Brian’s best friend, who once harbored an unrequited crush on Ellen. OnBlood of My Blood, he’s jolly and upbeat—a big change for those who know that he’ll descend into darkness by the timeOutlanderunfolds. “Murtagh became the way he was because something happened to make him closed down, very cynical,” says Davis. “That was why it was so exciting when we castRory [Alexander],because he has such a twinkle in his eye. Like, ‘Oh, it’s fresh-faced Murtagh.’ It’s not-had-his-heart-broken, full-of-optimism Murtagh. And we get the ‘fun,’ in quotes, of seeing how he got that way.” There is no official release date for the final season ofOutlander,nor do we know yet how its 10-episode prequel might be merged into the first show’s time-traveling plot. “I don’t have a lot of say in when these things air. I’m sure some fans wish the mothership would finish before [the new series],” says Davis. “But the last season ofOutlanderwouldn’t have been ready to launch this early. There will be a lot of sadness with it ending. To have something else that will be completely different, but still scratch anOutlanderitch, is helpful. Also, selfishly, I want to celebrate the end ofOutlanderon its own—and the longer we go without airing, the more it stays alive for me.” At first, Davis assumed a potential prequel series would center solely on Jamie’s parents. But showrunner Matthew B. Roberts wanted to integrate Claire’s parents—who, asOutlanderviewers and readers know, will get in a fateful car accident while on holiday in the Scottish Highlands when their daughter is only a young girl. Following parallel love stories made perfect sense to Davis. “Outlanderisn’t just about Jamie—it’s about JamieandClaire.” Dividing the narrative between two couples has proved equal parts liberating and challenging. “You’re not killing your actors as much as we probably killed Caitríona and Sam in the first seasons,” Davis tellsVF.“But on the other hand, it’s more difficult because you want to make sure both stories are unique. I feel like we’ve succeeded in doing that. They’re both very, very passionate love stories, but in a completely different way.” Like her costar, Hermione Corfield auditioned for a role onOutlanderyears before she was tapped to play Claire’s mother, Julia. “We’ve used a lot of crew members on bothOutlanderandBOB,and a lot of people did double takes whenever Hermione or Jamie would step on set because they did look so much like their predecessors,” says Davis. The typically blonde Corfield had never noticed a likeness to Balfe until she dyed her hair dark. “That’s when people started to go, ‘Oh wow, that is actually quite similar,’” Corfield says. “I’ve had a few people say we have the same mannerisms. I’m deeply flattered.” Little is known about Julia and Henry in theOutlanderuniverse, which was freeing for Corfield. “She has similarities to Claire, but her own personality and desires and dreams,” says the British actor. “London’s being bombed every day, and you don’t know what’s going to happen. She’s lost her parents in a similar way to Claire. So she’s a fiercely independent woman. There is a resilience and a need for survival that I found really interesting. She has to become harder in that harsh reality….I came to understand what she was capable of.” There is a top-secret twist to Claire and Henry’s love story, but it’s safe to say that much of their courtship is a long-distance one—which makes any scene with Corfield and Jeremy Irvine in the same room feel utterly electric. “When they are separated, the audience hopefully remembers that palpable attraction and that fun and joy,” she says—“why they long for each other to this degree.” Corfield and Irvine met on a 2016 film, remaining friends until they were cast as love interests nearly a decade later. “We make each other laugh a lot. I would describe it as a sibling-y relationship where we’re quite rude to each other,” she says. “So there’s already that chemistry. Knowing each other made all of the intimate stuff so easy and straightforward and comfortable, which is all you can really ask for.” Joining the world ofOutlander,a franchise famous for itssteamy, kilt-ripping love scenes, requires leads to get both emotionally and literally naked. Jamie Roy credits both his leading lady and the show’sintimacy coordinator,Vanessa Coffey,with fostering a safe space around the show’s sex scenes. “I trust Harriet with everything. And when you have that trust, you can let your guard down and be vulnerable,” he says. “It was definitely an experience, wearing all the intimacy stuff, likethe pouchesand everything. But once you’ve done a few takes, it does feel normal.” Roy still remembers his meet-cute with Slater. “We had a chemistry read in the most awkward of situations. It was on a bank holiday in Scotland. Everybody was off”—even series directorJamie Payne,who Zoomed in to watch the actors read lines in a largely vacant studio. “Beforehand, I’d met with some actors that were fantastic, but I couldn’t find that spark for any of them. I thought I was doing something wrong,” says Roy. Then Slater entered the picture. “When I met her, something shifted. I was like, ‘Oh,thisis what I’ve been missing.’ It was the only time that I’d ever read that scene the way that I did, and it was really special. I remember getting to the taxi after, and I text casting: ‘That’s the one, right?’” When Roy got his third shot at booking anOutlandershow, he tried to keep Sam Heughan’s voice out of his head. “My gut was to stay away from it and just do my own thing. Because when I got the audition, there was something about it that just spoke to me,” he says. “I remember thinking to myself, This is you in a nutshell. Then after the fact, Jamie Payne, the director of the first few episodes, said that Sam and I had so many similarities in the way that we were as people. So when people watch it, they’ll think, ‘Oh yeah, he’s picked that up from Sam,’ or whatever. But that’s just a happy coincidence.” Here are a few more coincidences: Roy’s actual middle name is Brian. And, strangely enough, “Jamie Roy” is a pseudonym that Jamie Fraser uses onOutlander. At a certain point, even Roy got wary of all the comparisons. That changed when he and Heughan met for coffee midway through filmingOutlander: Blood of My Blood.“We just clicked—talked about work for, I don’t know, five, ten minutes, and then started chatting about random stuff just as two bros would do,” says Roy. “And he’s still being so supportive to this day. Any time anything’s released, artwork or posters or trailers, he’s always one of the first people to text me: ‘Dude, it looks so cool. Congrats. Can’t wait to see it.’ And that means a lot.” Caitríona Balfe and Hermione Corfield also met for drinks while shooting their respective shows in Glasgow. As Roy prepares for his life to change, he’s happy to share the pressures of leading a beloved franchise. “We all have four very distinct personalities. I like to think of it as a little circle: Each of us is a quadrant, and we fit together perfectly,” he says. “So there’s no butting heads. I always say the best things in life are the best until they’re shared, and then they’re even better.” How much better could things be, really? “I was born and raised in Scotland, and I moved to America to make it. Then you move back for your big break—and you’re living five minutes away from where you went to school,” Roy says with a shake of his head. “There was something so poetic about that. It was like a full-circle moment of the child going away to become a man, and coming back with all the lessons he’s learned. Whether I’m a man, or still a little boy, I don’t know.” It seemsOutlanderhas taught him something about the elasticity of time, an idea central to the franchise’s characters—past, present, and future.

We’ve just begun an hour-long guided tour through 130 years of filmmaking, and whether or not Bates is the kind of person to shout about it, she’s been a meaningful part of that history. She won the best-actress Oscar forMiseryin 1991, when she was 42 years old, and has since starred in multiple other films that won Oscars and been nominated for another three herself across three different decades. Mementos from her projects are scattered in the museum’s collection, which gives us an excuse to wander around like any other movie lovers. Bates marvels at a snippet ofAn American in Paris:“I want to watch that again when I get home.” She urges strangers passing by to listen in to our guide: “Hang out and hear what she has to say!” And she’s rendered speechless by footage from a range of 1920s films that have been painstakingly restored to their original colors for the first time ever. She sits through the whole reel as if having a spiritual experience. This is the world that Bates grew up in awe of and eventually made her home. The Memphis native is the youngest of three girls and was raised by parents much older than those of her peers. (Her father, an engineer, was born in 1900.) Bates moved to New York at 21 during a bitterly cold winter to try to make a living as an actor and established herself as a Broadway powerhouse before moving to Hollywood. Fifty-some years later, she’s a living legend in LA, warmly smiling at those who recognize her in passing. We enter the museum’s spacious David Geffen Theater. Bates spent nine years on the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’s Board of Governors, starting in the late ’90s, and still tries to watch all the Oscar nominees. She peppers our guide with questions about the theater’s projection quality and what kinds of movies get shown here during the week. She listens keenly for answers. She’s not interested in a one-sided conversation. As we exit the room, she pulls me aside and whispers, “I want to make sure we have time totalk.” Downstairs at Fanny’s, the museum’s restaurant, Bates settles on her lunch order. “I want a burger,” she tells me. “Oh God, that just looks so good. I haven’t had a burger in so long.” The server approaches and she asks for hers medium rare with everything on it, plus grilled onions, and french fries on the side—extra crispy. “And what is your name, sir?” Bates asks the server. “Joe,” he replies, fully aware of who’s asking. “I’m Kathy, and this is David.” Joe lights up at the friendliness. He tells Bates that, just a few days prior, he was so excited when she won a Critics Choice Award that he posted a picture of her accepting the trophy on his Instagram. He sent it to his partner and everything. “We loveMatlock,” he says. It’s Bates’s turn to light up: “Isn’t it fun?” Courtesy ofMatlock,Bates is in the midst of a career renaissance. Just before signing on to the CBS series at the top of 2023, she felt “invisible,” maybe even done acting. Opportunities were dwindling. She wondered if she should sell her house and leave LA. Just before COVID hit, she’d been cast in what would have been her first Broadway show in nearly 40 years: Sarah Ruhl’sBecky Nurse of Salem.Scott Rudin was producing the project, but it fell apart because of his reported feud with Ruhl’s agent. “I took a fucking meeting with Scott for this when Joni Mitchell wanted me to come to her 75th-birthday party,” Bates says later. “I wish I’d gone to Joni’s because here I was withthisguy.” The play may have been her last chance to return to where she made her name as an actor, and it vanished: “The reaction that I had was a physical devastation. And to this day, Scott Rudin has never gotten in touch.” (Rudin announced that he would “step back from active participation” in Broadway productions a few years later after widespread allegations of workplace bullying and mistreatment.) Like many, Bates felt isolated by the pandemic. A difficult experience on a movie she won’t name, from a few years ago, didn’t help matters either. Then came theMatlockpilot, written byJane the Virgincreator Jennie Snyder Urman and (very) loosely based on the original legal procedural starring Andy Griffith. Bates didn’t think much of it at first. The episode introduced veteran lawyer Madeline “Matty” Matlock as she charmed her way into an associate position at a cutthroat firm. She got put on a case, learned the new ropes, and eventually helped her team eke out a victory. Bates had done plenty of network TV before. She knew this formula. But then, those last few pages—and that twist! The pilot ends by revealing that Matty is actually Madeline Kingston, a wealthy retiree who’s infiltrated the firm to bring it down: She believes that one of its lawyers protected a pharmaceutical company instead of getting dangerous opioids off the market—opioids that caused her daughter’s death. The series has evolved into a hell of a showcase for Bates as she weaves between the two identities: righteous, grieving crusader and sweet, maternal colleague. The actor, long known for her tremendous range, gets to run the gamut. “All of her characters have that soft heart, that place you can enter—and then she can flip them,” Snyder Urman says. Executive producer Eric Christian Olsen tells me via email, “You can feel her rip the oxygen out of the room and everything goes dead still—like right before a storm, rippling with electricity.” Matlockwas a major hit right out of the gate and now averages 16 million viewers an episode. Naturally, it earned a swift renewal. Around the premiere, Bates toldTheNew York TimesthatMatlockwould be her “last dance”—which resulted in an outpouring of public affection: “I was like, ‘Y’all, where were you when I was sitting on the couch by myself?’ ” Bates says with a booming cackle. While she has walked back the notion of retirement, she tells me: “I have a feeling this is going to be the last thing I do. I hope we run a good while—I really do.” If it does turn out to be her swan song, the show has given Bates one last glorious awards run. The Critics Choice Awards are known as a pivotal stopover for movies during Oscar season, so it’s odd for a “best actress in a drama series” win to be the highlight. But as Bates took the stage, the starry crowd—filled with her collaborators across the years, from Colin Farrell (2001’sAmerican Outlaws) to Nicole Kidman (last year’sA Family Affair)—rose for a rousing standing ovation. “She’s one of the greats,” Kidman tells me later. “I love her resilience and what she represents. Her story is extraordinary.” The warm industry embrace took days for Bates to process. “It’s the affirmation of a career that hasn’t always been up here with the A-team going to Ibiza or whatever, you know?” she says as our food arrives. “It hasn’t been a straight trajectory.” FANS FEARED BATES MIGHT RETIRE AFTERMATLOCK,WHICH INSPIRED ANOUTPOURING OF PUBLIC AFFECTION:“I WAS LIKE, ’Y’ALL, WHERE WERE YOU WHEN I WASSITTING ON THE COUCH BY MYSELF?’ ” She pauses and looks down. “I don’t know how I’m going to get my mouth around it.” I tilt my head in confusion, before realizing she’s talking about her burger, not her award. “Okay,” she says. “Here I go.” I feel our conversation is like my career,” Bates says between bites after a brief silence. “My niece, Linda, calls it ‘getting lost in the right direction.’ ” By the time she madeMisery,Bates had already earned a Tony nomination for her work on Broadway, but it was as the maniacally cheerful, then maniacally violent nurse Annie Wilkes that she became a thrillingly unconventional Hollywood lead. “I was in my prime,” she says. “I was in my 40s by then, and I felt totally in command—and powerful.” She also navigated a prickly dynamic with her costar, James Caan (who died in 2022). He clashed with Bates over her stringent stage-trained methods, like preferring extensive rehearsals. “Jimmy—God rest him—was going through his own shit, and he’d apologized for it and we were cool [before he died],” Bates says. “I was at his memorial service and his assistant said something really lovely: ‘Jimmy told me before he died that he wished that you guys had gotten to know each other better.’ ” Bates ruled theawards circuitforMiseryand then waited for another great role. And waited. “It was like a desert,” she says. “There was quite a while where I didn’t know what was going to happen next.” One reason why was dismayingly obvious: She didn’t look like other movie stars. During one of her first interviews forMisery—which is to say, one of her first interviews for any film—a journalist said to Bates, “You’re not Michelle Pfeiffer.” Around this same time, the late Garry Marshall declined to cast her in his film adaptation ofFrankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune,despite the fact that she’d originated the stage role to great acclaim. “He couldn’t make the leap that people would see me onscreen kissing someone,” Bates says. “Me actually kissing a man onscreen—that would not be romantic.” How did she react to hearing that? “Well, I’ve always had that,” she says with a shrug. Years after leaving her native Tennessee, Bates learned that her father had told her hometown acting teacher, “You know, she’s not conventionally attractive.” In one of her favorite post-Miseryroles—she’d rather not name the movie—she filmed a meaningful, rare romantic kissing scene that was cut from the final edit. That one still stings. The year afterMisery,Bates promoted the adventure epicAt Play in the Fields of the Lord,in which she and Aidan Quinn played spouses. She recalls a British journalist asking Quinn, right in front of her: “You’re a leading man. Is it believable that you and Kathy would be married?” Bates felt crushed; she could guess the premise of the article to come. “I went upstairs, I locked the door, and I cried like a kindergartner,” she says. A producer encouraged her to toughen up, but she needed some time to herself. “I wanted to get on a plane. They said, ‘Actually, Ms. Bates, there’s one leaving right now.’ I said, ‘Great. Get me on it.’ I got on Virgin Air. Sat down. Picked up a magazine. It’s aboutFrankie and Johnny.” Bates erupts in laughter. There was glamorous Michelle Pfeiffer, cast in the part that Bates had been denied. Onscreen, Bates built up an unusual filmography as an adored star who rarely played the lead. Oscar nominee Alfre Woodard met her in the ’80s New York theater scene, and they bonded over how to navigate their industry’s narrow-mindedness. “Both of us were looked at as the friend, the neighbor next door, the crazy one—the action away from the center of the frame, which always had a wilting, de-nourished white girl in the middle of it, honestly,” she says. Woodard observed Bates cultivating a dedicated fan base despite regular rejection from Hollywood. Her success “is not because of a production company, a studio, a director—it is those people that see her and just go,Ah.They identify something in her,” Woodard says. “They’re touched by something in her. She is beloved by regular people everywhere.” “I don’t feel comfy,”Bates says now of working in Hollywood, even having lost 100 pounds within the last seven or so years. “I never felt that I belonged, but that’s okay. I see them sail away in their gowns….” Later, she leans in with a mischievous grin. “So now? It’s sweet revenge. Oh, Miss Beauty Queen, you had a career up until your 40s and you can’t work? Too bad!” Bates grimaces at the comment. It came out harsher than intended. But the Bates emerging in this moment, an hour into lunch, is liberated—boisterous and warm, proud and profane. “I’ll think, Oh, you shouldn’t say this; oh, you shouldn’t say that,” she says. “But then I say, ‘Fuck it—I’m 76. Can’t I justsayit?’ ” And when Bates saysfuck,trust: She’s letting you in. The more she sprinkles the word into our back-and-forth, the more liberated she appears. It’s a regular presence on her sets too. “Often when she saw me approaching with direction between takes, she’d say, ‘What? What, you fucker,what?’ ” Alexander Payne, who directed Bates to an Oscar nod for 2002’sAbout Schmidt,tells me in an email. “I’d keep my comments as concise as possible and watch her processing them like a finely tuned machine. Then I’d watch in wonder as my small directions rippled through the next take.” About Schmidtremains the project where Bates was most literally naked onscreen. She played the eccentric and free-spirited Roberta, who at one point makes a pass at Jack Nicholson’s eponymous grump in her hot tub. Bates and Payne had severallong conversationsabout how to shoot it. “He was talking about getting a merkin; I was overweight, so I didn’t want to do that,” Bates says. “My tits were really big, and it was a problem because my tits kept floating to the surface. That was a difficult moment: Sitting in the tub with Jack, he’s talking about how he had done some Japanese painting of a gorilla that he was giving to somebody. He was talking about Churchill. All these things. And I had a cosmopolitan, or maybe two—I had to relax.” But Bates committed—and always collaborated with an intense, invigorating focus. “I remember her calling me one evening to ask whether she could alter the prepositiontotoon,” Payne says. “I glanced at the script and saw, to my horror, that she’d found a typo.” This echoes Snyder Urman’s experience with Bates onMatlock:“She comes into the edit after I do my cut and watches and gives me ideas. If there’s a false note in a script, she’s going to find it.” Bates found her first great post-Miseryrole in another Stephen King adaptation, Taylor Hackford’s decades-spanningDolores Claiborne(1995), giving one of her deepest, most haunting performances as a woman accused of murder. She credits her success in the movie in part to the movement coach, dialect coach, and star hair-and-makeup team that were hired as she requested. “It’s like veterinary medicine—each part is a different animal,” Bates says. “You’ve got to figure out where the tail is, where the heart is, all that stuff.” In the late ’90s, colleagues increasingly took note of Bates’s sharp filmmaking instincts. Bates received her second Oscar nomination for 1998’sPrimary Colors,the Clinton campaign–inspired political drama, and she helped director Mike Nichols in choreographing a complex scene involving the results of a bombshell paternity test.InTitanic,meanwhile, Bates portrayed the “unsinkable” socialite Molly Brown, who at one point encourages Kate Winslet’s Rose to join her elitist mother, Ruth (Frances Fisher), on a lifeboat to safety, leaving behind some less fortunate—effectively doomed—passengers. Rose is reluctant, though, and ultimately stays behind. Working out how to approach the scene, Winslet turned to Bates. “Kate came over to me and she said, ‘Can you just give me an idea of this?’ and I said, ‘Give me a minute,’ ” Bates says. “When I came back from thinking, I said, ‘This is the first and last time she’s going to see her family for who they really are.’ ” Around this time, Bates got into directing and received an Emmy nomination for helming the 1999 A&E biopicDash and Lilly.She also served as one of the primary directors on the early seasons of the sprawling family sagaSix Feet Under.Bates may have been on the precipice of a great career behind the camera, but it stalled after her diagnosis of ovarian cancer in 2003. “It just changed everything. Something broke. I stopped that whole year,” she says. “Then I needed to make money, and I couldn’t make money directing. You don’t get paid the same.” She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2012, just after the cancellation of her short-lived legal dramaHarry’s Law,and underwent a double mastectomy. The silver lining of that scary period for Bates: “Ten pounds were gone. Five each, you know?” She now seems healthier than ever. It’s been about 20 years since Bates’s last credit as director, but she aims to helm an upcoming episode ofMatlock’s second season and is already intricately involved in the making of the show. “In my private time, I call her the Energizer Bunny—I literally have never seen anything like it,” says Sam Anderson, who plays her husband on the show. He first met Bates in an acting class 40 years ago and remembers her as a “sieve,” taking in every bit of knowledge and using whatever she could to sharpen her craft. Now, as an executive producer and number one on the call sheet, she still does—while also advocating for every other creative on set. “She tells directors, ‘Don’t let me be good—have the gumption to challenge me to be great, because I want to be great,’ ” says Skye P. Marshall, who plays Bates’s colleague onMatlock.“I can imagine directors coming in for one episode, how scary that could potentially be: giving Kathy Bates an adjustment. But she goes into it wanting to consistently be a student, to learn and be pushed.” Bates sums up herMatlockgig simply. “I’m doing everything I was trained to do,” she says. We’ve now crossed the two-hour mark of our interview. “It’s not that I hit every note exactly right, but I get to try. And I keep trying, and I keep trying.” It’s pouring outside now, and Bates’s niece, Linda, has been waiting patiently to take her home. We agree to pick things up on Zoom a week later. When we reconvene, Bates logs on from her couch with a list. “I started to fret about some things that we had talked about,” she says. She’s worried about how she discussed the way her appearance was treated in Hollywood: “It’s embarrassing.” Linda’s dog climbs on her head as she reconsiders. “But I think that’s fine. I can be embarrassed about it.” She mentions some other details she’d rather keep private, before smirking. “Is this weird, somebody telling you what to write and what not to write?” Strangely, it’s not. This is the person I’ve come to know: thorough, sensitive, magnificently conversational. “PEOPLE IDENTIFY SOMETHING IN HER,”SAYS ALFRE WOODARD. “THEY’RE TOUCHED BY SOMETHING IN HER. SHE ISBELOVED BY REGULAR PEOPLE EVERYWHERE.” One topic Bates is comfortable exploring: She lives with depression and has spent her life better understanding her mental health. “It used to be anathema—I needed help when I was a teenager, and it wasn’t talked about,” she says. She questions what she wants to say on the record. “I want to be really careful because I love my mother. We had difficult times growing up. It was not her fault.” Bates’s father attempted suicide in his early 80s, just before Bates began playing her breakthrough stage role, as a suicidal divorcée, in Broadway’s’night, Mother.That overlap was tough on Bates. There are times, too, when her depression comes on strong. “It’s always there underneath…almost like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde—you can feel really good and then there are times when you get swept under,” she says. “I don’t want to get out of bed. I don’t want to see anybody. I don’t want to talk to anybody. All of my closest people know when it’s happening—they back away.” I ask if there’s anything else Bates hopes to clarify before we wrap. “I wanted to talk about how difficult it is to talk about what I do,” she says. “It’s what I’ve spent my life doing, and I don’t know how to talk about it.” She pauses, and after a time, decides to stop worrying about how this piece will be received. “People are going to think what they think, right?” she says. One thing I can promise is that Bates’s inner life helps her go where she goes onscreen. It’s at least partly why she can terrify us inMisery,break our hearts inPrimary Colors,find that jagged human comedy inAbout Schmidt,and so on. Everything she does is inside her.

    "article_text": "Combination of Western and Chinese medicine relieves pain of knee osteoarthritis amid long queues for joint replacement surgery Hong Kong’s public hospitals are offering more patients with a degenerative knee condition an extra treatment option combining Western and Chinese medicine to relieve pain and slow down deterioration amid a long queue for joint replacement surgery. The Hospital Authority said the pilot scheme targeting knee osteoarthritis, which was launched in May last year, was its first integrated Chinese-Western medicine outpatient service and had been expanded to Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern, Queen Elizabeth, United Christian and Yan Chai hospitals. Dr Wun Yiu-chung, chairman of the authority’s Coordinating Committee in Orthopaedics and Traumatology, said that with an ageing population in Hong Kong, knee osteoarthritis was one of the most common orthopaedic conditions and such cases had been on the rise. “As the disease will become more common, it will be a huge challenge for the healthcare system. Thus, our goal is to maintain and improve the quality of life for the elderly,” said Wun, who is also the chief of service in orthopaedics and traumatology for hospitals in the New Territories West area. “There are many successful and valuable experiences in mainland China by using the concepts of step-up therapy and chronic disease management to help patients with knee osteoarthritis at different levels. We established the integrated service after learning from these valuable experiences.”",

Wang Haibo, director of the China Organ Transplant Response System (COTRS), told the Post on the sidelines of the Hospital Authority Convention on Tuesday that it would take time to revise laws on the mainland to spur the establishment of the mechanism. “There is a legal hurdle for that,” Wang said. “We have the HIV regulation, which bans [the transfer of] organs across the border. “Organ, blood and tissue … cannot [be transferred] across the border.” COTRS is a national system which allocates organs for transplants throughout the country. Wang said that the specific law that stymied the development of the cross-border mechanism was related to controls to prevent the spread of HIV.",
