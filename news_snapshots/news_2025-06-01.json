    "article_text": "Alison Eastwood told Fox News Digital she is \"very thankful\" her father chose to raise her outside of Hollywood. Clint Eastwooddeclared that he has no intention of slowing down as he marks his 95th birthday. In a recent interview with theAustrian newspaper Kurier,the legendary actor and director, who turned 95 on Saturday, revealed that he is in pre-production on a new movie, dispelling rumors that 2024's \"Juror #2\" would be his final film. \"There’s no reason why a man can’t get better with age,\" he explained. \"And I have much more experience today. Sure, there are directors who lose their touch at a certain age, but I’m not one of them.\" Clint Eastwood is celebrating his 95th birthday.(Kevin Winter/Getty Images for AFI) Eastwood launched his acting career in 1954 when he secured a contract with Universal Pictures. He initially struggled to land roles and took on minor parts in movies, including 1955's \"Tarantula\" and \"Revenge of the Creature\" before Universal terminated his contract in 1955. CLINT EASTWOOD'S DAUGHTER SAYS 'VERY STRICT' DAD HAD THIS PIECE OF ADVICE GROWING UP The actor landed his breakthrough role when he was cast as Rowdy Yates in the popular TV western \"Rawhide,\" which aired from 1959 to 1965. Eastwood also found international stardom during the 1960s when he played The Man with No Name — a fearless gunfighter whose stoicism masked his brutality. The character appeared in director Sergio Leone's Italian westerns, popularly known as \"spaghetti westerns,\" and included 1964's \"A Fistful of Dollars\"; 1965's \"For a Few Dollars More,\" and 1966's \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.\" In 1967, the three films were released in the United States and became box office hits, establishing Eastwood as a bankableHollywood star. Eastwood won two Oscars for \"Unforgiven.\"(Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.) While continuing to star in Westerns including \"The Outlaw Josey Wales\" and \"Pale Rider,\" Eastwood made his directorial debut in 1971 when he helmed the critically acclaimed movie \"Play Misty For Me.\" That same year, Eastwood starred aspolice inspectorHarry Callahan in the action-thriller \"Dirty Harry.\" The movie was a critical and commercial success and spawned four sequels. Eastwood received two Academy Awards in 1992, after directing and producing the classic Western \"Unforgiven.\" \"I'm going to work while I can still learn something or until I'm really senile.\" In 1995, Eastwood co-starred with Meryl Streep in the hit romantic drama \"The Bridges of Madison County,\" based on the novel of the same name. The role marked a departure from his usual tough-guy roles and showcased his versatility as an actor. The California native found further success with the critical and commercial hits \"Mystic River\" (2003), \"Million Dollar Baby\" (2004) and \"Letters From Iwo Jima\" (2006). At age 74, Eastwood became the oldest person ever to win the Academy Award for Best Director for \"Million Dollar Baby,\" which also earned an Oscar for Best Picture. A few of Eastwood's other acclaimed movies include \"Gran Torino\" (2008) \"Invictus\" (2009), \"J. Edgar\" (2011), \"American Sniper\" (2014), \"Sully\" (2016), \"The Mule\" (2018),\"Richard Jewell\" (2019)and \"Cry Macho\" (2021). Eastwood has shown range in front of the camera, starring in the \"Dirty Harry\" series in the '70s.(Dirty Harry) While speaking with Kurier, Eastwood reflected on the secret behind his drive. \"I always knew that you can get further with a positive attitude to life than with a negative one,\" he said. \"You shouldn't see the glass as half empty. And I had that feeling when I was 25, as an aspiring actor who was contemptuously told by numerous producers that I was a failure. I even heard a little voice inside me back then that said you could do it.\" LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

My philosophy is: do something new or stay at home.\" Eastwood said he is in pre-production on a new movie.(Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images for CinemaCon) Eastwood, who has been married twice and has had several long-term partners, is father to eight children including daughter Laurie, 69, daughter Kimber, 60, son Kyle, 57,daughter Alison, 53, son Scott, 39, daughter Kathryn, 37, daughter Francesca, 31, and daughter Morgan, 28.

At a certain point, I have always been older than my wives, but I feel just as young as them, at least mentally.\" \"And physically I'm still doing well, so hopefully no one will have to worry about me in this regard for a long time,\" he added. Eastwood plans to keep working \"while I can still learn something or until I'm really senile.\"(REUTERS) Eastwood also explained why he believes he has continued to find success after a careerspanning seven decades. \"I didn't repeat myself, I didn't always make the same kind of film, I always tried something new,\" he said. \"A new genre, a different role.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"As an actor, I was still under contract with a studio, was in the old system and was therefore forced to learn something new every year,\" he added. \"And that's why I'm going to work while I can still learn something or until I'm really senile.\" Ashley Hume is an entertainment writer for Fox News Digital.

    "title": "George Wendt’s mistaken jabs at John Boehner link 'Cheers' and Ohio politics",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on senators pushing for changes to the House-passed spending bill as it moves to the Senate for debate. There was no mistake when the beloved but forlorn accountant Norm Peterson chugged his way into the fictional TV bar \"Cheers.\" \"Norm!!!\" hollered the regulars in unison, ranging from mail carrier Cliff Clavin to \"Mayday\" Sam Malone, the former Major League pitcher-turned barkeep. If only formerHouse Speaker John Boehner,R-Ohio, or late Rep. Buz Lukens, R-Ohio, had been as recognizable to George Wendt, the actor who played Norm on the sitcom. REMEMBERING REP. CHARLIE RANGEL — AND A VOICEMAIL I'LL NEVER FORGET Wendt died last week atage 76. The portly, everyman, \"Willy Loman\" character Wendt created was one of the most iconic in the history of comedic television. Wendt’s portrayal of Norm earned him six consecutive Emmy nominations for Best Supporting Actor in a primetime series. But during Boehner’s first racefor Congressin 1990, Wendt inadvertently manufactured a bizarre and permanent connection to the future Speaker of the House. In 1989, Lukens represented Ohio’s 8th Congressional District. But WSYX-TV inColumbus, Ohio, secretly recorded Lukens at a McDonald’s speaking with the mother of a teenage girl. Lukens talked to the woman about getting her a government job. He hoped to keep her quiet about his sexual activities with her daughter. During Boehner’s first race for Congress in 1990, Wendt inadvertently manufactured a bizarre and permanent connection to the future Speaker of the House.(Reuters/Yuri Gripas) Lukens denied any wrongdoing in public. He was charged and later convicted of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. The House Ethics Committee launched an investigation. But Lukens declined to step aside. That teed up a three-way Republican primary between Lukens, the former congressman who represented the district, the late Rep. Tom Kindness, R-Ohio, and Boehner. Boehner was a state legislator at the time. The scandal embroiling Lukens created a rare opportunity to head to Washington. As strange as it seems now, Boehner was the least-known of the three Republican candidates in what turned out to be a brutal primary. But Boehner’s innate political acumen shone through – decades before he would ascend to the Speaker’s suite. Despite the scandal, Lukens remained popular in the district. He had served as the congressman decades earlier and returned to the House when Kindness ran unsuccessfully for the Senate against late-Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, in 1986. So with the Lukens scandal, Kindness wanted his job back. And Boehner hoped to capitalize on the opportunity. BY DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT: BATTLES TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' WILL FACE IN THE SENATE Can you top a name like that? \"Congressman Kindness.\" No wonder it was such a challenge for the upstart, future Speaker with the unpronounceable, Teutonic surname. But Boehner won. And even though he felled Lukens and Kindness, it was not a done deal that Boehner would win the general election. Boehner ran against Democrat Greg Jolivette, the mayor of Hamilton, Ohio, the biggest city in the 8th Congressional District. Jolivette was best known for changing the name of \"Hamilton,\" to \"Hamilton!\" in the 1980s. He also ran Jolly’s Drive-Ins in Hamilton. Imagine 1970s hamburger joints where you can order from your car, bedecked in orange. But we’re talking about \"Cheers\" here. Not \"Happy Days.\" Wendt was at the height of his popularity during the summer of 1990 as Boehner and Jolivette barreled toward a general election faceoff. So Wendt appeared on late-night TV on \"The Arsenio Hall Show.\" Look him up, kids. Hall’s syndicated show was never going to beat NBC’s \"The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson\" in the ratings. But the program scored major headlines in 1992, when future President Bill Clinton played saxophone on the show in an effort to appeal to a younger demographic, which gravitated to Hall rather than Carson. Wendt’s portrayal of Norm earned him six consecutive Emmy nominations for Best Supporting Actor in a primetime series.(Herb Ball/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty Images ) Clinton’s appearance was a seminal moment inAmerican politicsand may have helped him win the election. Certainly the most important political event on Hall’s show. Wendt’s appearance proved to be the second-most important. Jolivette was Wendt’s brother-in-law. He periodically parachuted into Ohio’s 8th District to campaign for Jolivette and against Boehner. So Hall asked him about Wendt’s political involvement and Jolivette. Wendt proceeded to essentially libel Boehner on the air. Wendt never mentioned Boehner by name. But Wendt mixed up Lukens and his sex scandal with Boehner. On national TV, no less. \"The guy he’s running against had some problems a while back,\" said Wendt, referring to Jolivette's opponent, but mixing Boehner up with Lukens. \"The guy from the 8th District had some convictions, some felony or a misdemeanor or something. So I think it’s time for a change. One thing’s for sure, I know, Greg’s not going tobe a criminal.\" TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' FACES CRUCIAL HOURS AS JOHNSON COURTS FREEDOM CAUCUS Hall is an Ohio native. But he was apparently not versed in the Lukens scandal – even though it was a national story and commanded daily headlines. He didn’t inquire further or correct Wendt. After all, this was a late-night comedy and variety show. Not \"Meet the Press.\" A publicist for Hall blamed the issue entirely on Wendt, saying the host has no control over \"what (guests are) going to say.\" Things then turned nasty when Boehner’s team put out a statement. \"We, like a lot of viewers, are confused about the conversation last night. We don’t know if they were talking about Congressman Lukens’ problems or perhaps the theft complaint filed with the Hamilton (Ohio) Police against Greg Jolivette,\" said the Boehner campaign. American comedian and talk show host Arsenio Hall poses for a portrait sitting in his chair in Los Angeles, circa 1991.(Bonnie Schiffman/Getty Images) Jolivette’s campaign argued this was an old allegation and it wasn’t true. They then demanded that Boehner fire Barry Jackson, Boehner’s campaign manager. Jackson called the episode \"cheap gutter politics.\" Boehner himself pinned the case of mistaken identity on Wendt. He believed the actor should have been more responsible for what he said on national TV. Boehner didn’t fire Jackson. Jackson worked with Boehner for years and later served as his chief of staff when he became House speaker. Wendt’s gaffe was not fatal for Boehner. Even though there were nearly as many Democrats as Republicans registered in the 8th District in those days, it had elected Republicans for years. And Boehner vanquished Jolivette 61-39 percent in the general election. The rest is history for Boehner. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fast-forward to today. Boehner tookto Xafter the actor’s death. The former Speaker explained how Wendt was the brother-in-law of his opponent and \"went on a late-night TV show and said some tough things.\" Boehner said that Wendt was \"confusing me with someone else. He called later to apologize and we had a great conversation. Raising a glass tonight to the man America will always remember as Norm.\" Or, as they might say on the show, \"Cheers.\" Chad Pergram currently serves as a senior congressional correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC).

    "article_text": "Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., joins 'Fox News Sunday' to discuss the future of President Donald Trump's 'Big, Beautiful Bill' as the GOP works through budget cuts. PresidentDonald Trumpon Saturday warned Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., he would be \"playing right into the hands of the Democrats\" if he votes against Trump's \"Big, Beautiful Bill.\" \"IfSenator Rand Paulvotes against our Great, Big, Beautiful Bill, he is voting for, along with the Radical Left Democrats, a 68% Tax Increase and, perhaps even more importantly, a first time ever default on U.S. Debt,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social Saturday afternoon. \"Rand will be playing right into the hands of the Democrats, and the GREAT people of Kentucky will never forgive him! The GROWTH we are experiencing, plus some cost cutting later on, will solve ALL problems. America will be greater than ever before!\" Paul told \"Fox News Sunday\"last weekend he supports the tax and spending cuts in the bill, which he still slammed as \"wimpy and anemic, but I still would support the bill, even with wimpy and anemic cuts if they weren’t going to explode the debt. The problem is the math doesn't add up. They’re going to explode the debt by, the House says, $4 trillion. The Senate’s actually been talking about exploding the debt $5 trillion.\" INSIDE THE LATE-NIGHT DRAMA THAT LED TO TRUMP'S TAX BILL PASSING BY 1 VOTE President Donald Trump on Saturday warned Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., he would be \"playing right into the hands of the Democrats\" if he votes against the president's \"Big, Beautiful Bill.\"(Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images; Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) The bill narrowly passed the House May 22 and will soon be voted on in the Senate, where Republicans can only afford to lose three votes. Others, like Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., have also expressed concerns about the bill. TRUMP SLAMS REPUBLICAN ‘GRANDSTANDERS’ OPPOSING BUDGET BILL, PREDICTS MASSIVE US TAX INCREASES IF IT FAILS Last weekend, Trump told reporters he was open to changes in the bill. \"I want the Senate and the senators to make the changes they want,\" he said. \"It will go back to the House, and we’ll see if we can get them. In some cases, the changes may be something I’d agree with, to be honest.\" Along with tax cuts, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act also includes stricter requirements for accessing Medicaid, changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) program and no taxes on overtime or tips. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., talks with reporters in the U.S. Capitol after the House passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act May 22.(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) Democrats have slammed the Medicaid reform section of the bill, mentioning possible cuts as a driving issue ahead of competitive midterm elections in 2026. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), a nonpartisan analyst for the U.S. Congress,estimates that 8.6 million peoplein the United States will lose health insurance by 2034 through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act's Medicaid reform. \"The Democrats have been focusing on this specific line of attack that 13.7 million Americans are going to lose their health care, and that's just blatantly false,\" Rep. Erin Houchin, R-Ind., told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview this week. House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Republicans celebrated passing Trump's \"Big, Beautiful Bill\" earlier this month.(Getty Images) \"Five million of those people are receiving a tax credit under the Affordable Care Act that was passed by the Democrats with a sunset date that was implemented by the Democrats. We're simply allowing the sunset date to expire as the Democrats originally intended,\" Houchin said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP CBO estimates that 13.7 million Americans will lose coverage by 2034, which also includes the 5 million Americans who were already about to lose coverage.

    "article_text": "Hudson Institute senior fellow Michael Doran analyzes U.S. foreign relations under the Trump administration on 'Life, Liberty and Levin.' TheWhite Houseon Saturday said it is in Iran’s \"best interest to accept\" its proposal on a nuclear deal following a report from the International Atomic Energy Agency saying the country is swiftly increasing its stockpile of near weapons-grade enriched uranium. \"President Trump has made it clear that Iran can never obtain a nuclear bomb,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \"Special Envoy [Steve] Witkoff has sent a detailed and acceptable proposal to the Iranian regime, and it’s in their best interest to accept it. Out of respect for the ongoing deal, the administration will not comment on details of the proposal to the media.\" The IAEA’s reportsaid Iranhad increased its stockpile to 900.8 pounds of uranium enriched by up to 60% as of May 17, a nearly 50% increase since the agency’s last report in February, which put the stockpile at 605.8 pounds. The report said Iran is \"the only non-nuclear-weapon state to produce such material,\" which is a \"serious concern.\" IRAN CONDEMNS AUSTRIA OVER REPORT ON ADVANCED NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM The White House on Saturday said it is in Iran’s \"best interest to accept\" its proposal on a nuclear deal after a report from the International Atomic Energy Agency said the country is increasing its stockpile of near weapons-grade enriched uranium.(Getty Images) The IAEAadded that just 92 pounds of 60% enriched uranium is enough to produce an atomic bomb if it is enriched to 90%. Iran maintains that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but U.S. intelligence agencies say the country has \"undertaken activities that better position it to produce anuclear device, if it chooses to do so.\" Iran’s Foreign Ministry and the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran said in a joint statement that the report was based on \"unreliable and differing information sources,\" claiming that it was biased and unprofessional. The statement added, \"The Islamic Republic of Iran expresses its disappointment about the report, which was prepared by imposing pressure on the agency for political purposes, and expresses its obvious objection about its content.\" Atomic Energy Organization of Iran spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Kazem Gharibabadi and International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi in front of the gate of the Fordow nuclear enrichment plant in Fordow near the city of Qom last November.(Atomic Energy Organization of Iran/AFP via Getty Images) On Thursday, Iran Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi wrote on X that he was unsure a U.S.-Iran nuclear deal could be imminently reached. \"Iran is sincere about a diplomatic solution that will serve the interests of all sides. But getting there requires an agreement that will fully terminate all sanctions and uphold Iran's nuclear rights — including enrichment,\" he wrote. IRAN FOREIGN MINISTER VOWS NUCLEAR ENRICHMENT WILL CONTINUE 'WITH OR WITHOUT A DEAL' Oman Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi presented the Trump administration’s first formal proposal in Tehran Saturday, which calls for Iran to cease all uranium enrichment and for a regional consortium that includes Iran, Saudi Arabia and other Arab states and the U.S. for producing nuclear power, TheNew York Times reported, citing people familiar with the document. An Iranian newspaper addresses the U.S.-Iran nuclear deal.(Alborz Irani/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office also put out a rare statement on a Saturday about the IAEA’s report, calling it \"grave.\" \"The agency presents a stark picture that serves as a clear warning sign: Despite countless warnings by the international community, Iran is totally determined to complete its nuclear weapons program,\" Netanyahu’s office said. \"The report strongly reinforces what Israel has been saying for years — the purpose of Iran’s nuclear program is not peaceful. This is evident from the alarming scope of Iran’s uranium enrichment activity. Such a level of enrichment exists only in countries actively pursuing nuclear weapons and has no civilian justification whatsoever. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"The report clearly indicates that Iran remains in non-compliance of its fundamental commitments and obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and continues to withhold cooperation from IAEA inspectors. The international community must act now to stop Iran.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

    "title": "Defence review to send 'message to Moscow' – Healey",
    "article_text": "The defence review will send a \"message to Moscow\" about Britain's \"readiness to fight if required\", Defence Secretary John Healey has told the BBC. He was speaking as the government announced it would spend £1.5bn on at least six new defence factories and create 1,800 jobs across the UK. The strategic defence review, to be published on Monday, is expected to conclude the UK faces a \"new era of threat\" and will warn of the \"immediate and pressing\" danger posed by Russia and other countries, including China. John Healey told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg the review would set out \"big new investments in our national security\" and send a strong signal to hostile states. The Conservatives said they welcomed investment in new munitions but shadow defence secretary James Cartlidge called for \"greater ambition for the pace and scale of rearmament our armed forces require\". On a visit to a factory in Stevenage, where Storm Shadow missiles are assembled, Healey said the government would support the procurement up to 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons. The new funding will see UK munitions spending hit £6bn during this parliament, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said. Healey told the BBC: \"Six billion over the next five years in factories like this which allow us not just to produce the munitions that equip our forces for the future but to create the jobs in every part of the UK -  1,800 new jobs in every nation of the United Kingdom.\" He added: \"This is a message to Moscow as well. This is Britain standing behind making our Armed Forces stronger but making our industrial base stronger, and this is part of our readiness to fight if required, but the strength in which to deter those fights in the future.\" The war in Ukraine has highlighted serious deficiencies in the West's ability to produce weapons and munitions, and senior British military officers have long warned about the UK's depleted stockpiles. As part of its defence review, the government said it would build new factories to make key munitions and explosives to have an \"always on\" munitions production capacity that could be scaled up quickly. Long-range weapons including drones and missiles would be procured over several years. Ministers said the extra investment - which came after Healy said that UK defence spending would rise to 3% of GDP by 2034 at the latest - would strengthen the armed forces and boost British jobs. Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: \"A strong economy needs a strong national defence, and investing in weaponry and munitions and backing nearly 2,000 jobs across Britain in doing so is proof the two go hand-in-hand. \"We are delivering both security for working people in an uncertain world and good jobs, putting more money in people's pockets.\" In a statement, Healey said the UK's defence industry would become an \"engine for economic growth\" and \"boost skilled jobs in every nation and region\". \"The hard-fought lessons from [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's illegal invasion of Ukraine show a military is only as strong as the industry that stands behind them,\" he added. \"We are strengthening the UK's industrial base to better deter our adversaries and make the UK secure at home and strong abroad.\" The Tories, however, said it was hard to believe Labour was prepared for \"always on\" munitions production when procurement had been \"largely switched off for the past year\". \"We welcome investment in new munitions factories, but we don't know when they will be ready, only that these orders should have been placed months ago,\" Cartlidge added. \"Rachel Reeves has deliberately used the SDR to put an effective freeze on new orders for the kit our military needs,\" he said. Senior Western military chiefs have long been warning the UK would quickly run out of ammunition in the event of a war. In 2021, the former head of the US Army in Europe, Gen Ben Hodges, told MPs in a simulated wargame most of the British Army's inventory was exhausted after just eight days. The former head of the British Army, Gen Sir Patrick Sanders, has also been calling for the UK to boost weapons production. He recently said the Army's diminished stocks of artillery rounds and missiles \"would put hairs on the back of your neck\". The UK has now significantly increased production of artillery shells. New contracts have been signed to produce more complex weapons, such as next generation light anti-tank weapons (NLAW) and long-range Storm Shadow (also known as Scalp) cruise missiles. Both have been supplied to Ukraine but production rates have, in the past, been slow. Exact numbers are not made public. With the war in Ukraine, global demand for explosives and propellants has also been high. The UK has often had to source materials from abroad.

Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, the comedian described how he had used running, reading and breathing exercises to help centre himself, after previously having suicidal thoughts. \"Recognising it is half the battle,\" he told host Lauren Laverne. \"So sometimes I just go through a dark period and I know that I've got to do something about it.\" The broadcaster also said he often felt conflicted about how much of his own mental health journey to share publicly, noting: \"You’ve got to be careful because it's triggering [for other people]. \"The way that I try and tackle that is to talk about it, I'm trying to normalise feeling like that, not that it is normal, but I'm trying to destigmatise it to make the conversation normal,\" he said. \"You would talk about physical illness openly, ideally you would talk about [mental health] openly, and you'd express all those things, but you do also have to be mindful of the fact that people may have been affected by that. \"And then if I suddenly say I had thoughts about taking my own life and somebody's lost someone through that or they've had those moments themselves, you have to be sensitive to that. \"You don't always get it right,\" he reflected, \"but I think the rewards outweigh the risks.\" The 47-year-old also said he had learned it was important to make time for activities which he knew would make him feel better. \"One of the things I've noticed when it comes to mental health, is you do stuff that works, and it's proven to work for you personally, and then for some reason you just stop doing it,\" he said. \"You go, 'Oh, it's really good if I spend some time reflecting, or if I run, or do a bit of reading, or some breathing exercises, that makes me feel better'. \"'Oh, I've done that every day for a week, I'm really feeling better, shall I just stop? Yeah!'\" he laughed. \"And then a few weeks later, wonder why I feel much worse than I did.\" The presenter, who first got into comedy in the early 2010s, picked tracks from the likes of Kanye West, Eminem and Huey Lewis and the News for Desert Island Discs, which is broadcast on Sunday. Ranganathan, who hosts a weekend show on BBC Radio 2, also spoke about how his family had moved to the UK from Sri Lanka in 1970, before he was born eight years later. \"My dad was a bit of a tornado, he came over to England and he'd been so used to the Sri Lankan way of life,\" he recalled. \"He was like a kid in a candy store, people were drinking and going out and he just threw himself into British life, wholly and completely. \"And there's a strong argument he should've implemented more boundaries than he did,\" Ranganathan laughed. \"He was the life and soul of the party.\" The comedian said one of his biggest regrets \"is not having enough empathy or understanding\" of the situation his mother, Shanthi, faced when she moved to the UK aged 19. \"The difference between her experience and my dad's,\" Ranganathan said, \"is my dad was going off to work, where you're immediately thrust into social connections and situations and you're making friends just by dint of that being your lifestyle.\" In contrast, he said: \"My mum is at home and going to the shops and doing whatever, but thinking about it now, that's a 19-year-old girl who had kids in a foreign country. I don't say this lightly, my mum is one of my heroes.\" He recalled that, when he was 12, his father \"had fallen into financial trouble, he'd lost his job and he was trying to make money in his sort of Sri Lankan Del Boy way, and it wasn't working out and couldn't keep up the mortgage repayments on their house\". His father was later arrested and imprisoned for two years for fraud, when Romesh was still a teenager. Ranganathan said he has always struggled with his mental health, but had a particularly challenging time as a teenager, when he was doing his A-levels and his dad was in prison. His father died in 2011. \"I've been through in my life a number of periods of suicide ideation,\" Ranganathan said, but added: \"As I speak now, this is running close to one of the best places I've ever been in my life mentally.\" Migraines are one of the most complex neurological disorders. What is the science behind the latest hack? Retailers will no longer be able to sell single-use vapes as new laws come into force across the UK.

    "title": "Briton accused of plot to export US military tech",
    "article_text": "A British man has been indicted in the US for allegedly trying to smuggle \"sensitive American military technology\" to China, including missiles, air defence radar and drones. John Miller, 63, and a Chinese man, Cui Guanghai, are wanted by the FBI on charges relating to conspiracy to commit interstate stalking and conspiracy, smuggling and violations of the Arms Control Act. Mr Miller, a permanent US resident, and Mr Cui, 43, were both arrested in Serbia. They remain there and could now face extradition to the US. The Foreign Office has confirmed it is providing consular assistance to a British national following his arrest in April and it is \"in touch with the local authorities and his family\". Court documents suggest the two men discussed ways of exporting a device that could be used for encryption and decryption. They are alleged to have paid a $10,000 (£7,430) deposit for the equipment. Mr Miller and Mr Cui are also accused of trying to \"harass\" an anti-Chinese government protester, which included installing a tracking device on their car and slashing their tires. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche accused the pair of a \"blatant assault\" on US national security and its democratic values. He added: \"This Justice Department will not tolerate foreign repression on US soil, nor will we allow hostile nations to infiltrate or exploit our defence systems.\" If found guilty, Mr Miller could face up to 20 years in prison for violation of the Arms Export Control Act, and 10 years for smuggling. Court documents detail how the men allegedly solicited the procurement of US defence articles, including missiles, air defence radar, drones and cryptographic devices for unlawful export to China. Mr Cui and Mr Miller are said to have discussed with two individuals - identified as \"Individual 5\" and \"Individual 6\" in court documents - how to export a cryptographic device from the US to China. Items the men allegedly discussed using to smuggle the technology include small electronics, a blender and a motor starter. The indictment also alleges the pair enlisted two individuals in the US to carry out a plot that would have prevented a victim from protesting against Chinese President Xi Jinping's attendance at the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit held in Los Angeles in November 2023. Mr Miller and Mr Cui were unaware that those two individuals - identified in court documents as \"Individual 1\" and \"Individual 2\" - were acting at the direction of the FBI. \"The indictment alleges that Chinese foreign actors targeted a victim in our nation because he criticised the Chinese government and its president,\" said US Attorney Bill Essayli for the Central District of California. \"My office will continue to use all legal methods available to hold accountable foreign nationals engaging in criminal activity on our soil.\" A similar scheme allegedly played out in the spring of 2025, when the alleged victim announced in a public video feed that he planned to unveil two new artistic statues that depicted Xi and his wife. Mr Cui and Mr Miller paid two other individuals - identified in court documents as \"Individual 3\" and \"Individual 4\" - to try and dissuade the alleged victim from sharing his online display of statues. Those individuals were paid $36,000 (£26,745), but the indictment notes that those two people were also affiliated with and acting at the direction of the FBI. The two men remain in Serbia and the US is co-ordinating with Serbian officials regarding their pending extraditions. \"An indictment is merely an allegation,\" the US Attorney's Office of the Central District of California said in a statement. \"All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.\" At least six new factories will be built and up to 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons will be procured. It comes after the UN nuclear watchdog warned Iran has stepped up its production of enriched uranium. Ryan Coogler presented his smash-hit Sinners in Clarksdale, Mississippi, which served as inspiration for his genre-defying movie. The US defence secretary called on Asian countries to boost spending and work with the US to deter war. The US president's ramped-up threats are seen by many as an attempt to reshape a stronghold of the left. Could he succeed?",

    "title": "People say coke and fries are helping their migraines - but there's a twist",
    "article_text": "It's a condition that affects more than 10 million people in the UK. It can change futures, end careers, and shrink worlds. So when a hack comes along that says it can \"cure\", or at the very least fend off a migraine, people will try it. While there are medical treatments, there is no cure. Prescription medication can be very effective - but it doesn't always work. For many people there is no simple solution. Some discover their own ways of managing the debilitating pain: sitting in a hot bath while wearing an ice pack and drinking a smoothie, blasting the side of their face with a hairdryer. But now a new hack has suddenly gone viral - the McMigraine Meal. A simple offering of a full-fat coke and a portion of salty fries seems to be doing the trick for hundreds who've been extolling its virtues on TikTok. If there is any science behind these hacks - what do they do to the body? Nick Cook from Oxfordshire carries \"a wallet full of drugs\" around in case of a migraine attack. He will \"try anything\" to make the pain go away, he says. \"When you live with the condition, and you're working a five-day week and you need to carry on, you'll give anything a go.\" At its worst the pain around Nick's eye socket can feel like his eyeball is getting crushed. He says it's the caffeine and sugar in coke that helps him. \"If I catch it soon it enough it can sometimes work, when my vision goes fuzzy and I can feel one coming on.\" He stresses that drinking coke doesn't replace his amitriptyline tablets - the daily pain medication he takes to try to prevent migraines - but it does sometimes help him \"last until the end of the day\". For Kayleigh Webster, a 27-year-old who has had chronic migraines all her life, it's the salt on the chips that might slow down a migraine attack. \"It can help,\" she says cautiously, \"but it's certainly not a cure. \"Migraine is a complex neurological condition - and it can't be cured by a bit of caffeine, salt and sugar in a fast food meal.\" Kayleigh's tried cocktails of different medications, putting her feet in hot water, a flannel at the back of the head, acupuncture, cupping - but they've had little effect. One of the few treatments that has given her relief is medical Botox - having dozens of injections in her head, face and neck. It's still not clear how Botox works for migraine, but it's believed to block powerful pain signals being released from the nerves. A migraine - which can last days - is very different to a headache, which tend to be short-lived and can be treated more easily with painkillers like paracetamol. Migraines can cause head pain, neck pain, numbness, blurred vision, and even affect speech and movement. Skulls dating back to 3,000 BC show ancient Egyptians even had trouble with migraines - but despite that long history, their exact cause is still unknown. It's thought pain receptors in the blood vessels and nerve tissue around the brain misfire - sending incorrect signals that something is wrong. But we don't know why some people have an oversensitive nervous system - and why it reacts to some things and not others. Experts say there's not enough research into why only some people - around one in seven - are affected, or what can actually help. Dr Kay Kennis, a GP who specialises in migraines, says while there are elements of the McMigraine meal that can help stave off an attack, these aren't innate to \"a McDonald's\". \"The caffeine in the coke can act as a nerve disruptor, it is a substance that affects nerve activity. For some, that disturbance works in a positive way,\" Dr Kennis says. \"There are some painkillers that people take for migraines that have caffeine - and some do respond well to that - but we don't fully know why.\" But she warns against using caffeinated fizzy drinks like coke as a way of regularly managing migraines. \"Too much caffeine can be a trigger too - and you can end up in a worse situation in the long run,\" Dr Kennis says. Other ingredients in a fast food meal, like the salt on the chips, can affect nerve activity, she explains, but adds the effects of sodium on migraines have not been tested. She also warns that not only is fast food often ultra-processed and not conducive to a healthy diet, it can contain high levels of Tyramine, a natural compound commonly found in many foods, which can actually cause severe migraines. For Eloise Underwood none of the quick fixes on social media work. The chronic migraine sufferer has been looking for a \"magic cocktail\" for seven years - she's seen people recommend putting feet in scorching water (not recommended by experts and potentially dangerous); drinking hot coffee (caffeine can be a trigger); or various vibrating devices which have had little effect. \"There are so many videos online that take advantage of the desperation we all feel,\" Eloise explains. She's left several jobs - often due to lighting and noise in an office environment triggering migraines. She recently stopped working as an interior designer and has now launched a business pressing and framing wedding flowers from her home. She wears loop ear buds to reduce the sharpness of the sounds around her, and limits her social life. \"People think a migraine is just a headache - that's just one symptom of it,\" Eloise says. \"For me, a migraine is a whole body experience… \"Migraines have completely made my life smaller.\" Prof Peter Goadsby, a neurologist at the NIHR-King's Clinical Research Facility, says research is beginning to produce positive results after years of underfunding. His latest studyshows medications known as gepants could block a group of pain receptorsin the lead-up to a migraine attack, cutting off the pain before it starts. \"Any new treatment is a glimmer of hope,\" Eloise says. \"They do say that nothing will work for everyone - but something will work for someone.\" Lifestyle changes can also make a difference, Prof Goadsby explains. It might be boring, he says, but basically - \"be careful of your brain\". \"You want to have regularity, avoid the highs and lows. If you can feel the warning signs - yawning, sleepiness, mood change, passing more urine and even craving salt and sugar - listen to your body. \"Listen to your body - don't listen to TikTok, that's my advice.\" Nick has been doing exactly that. He might reach for the odd coke and salty fries, but he's moulded his whole life in order to manage his migraines. \"I don't drink, I wear sunglasses even if it's cloudy,\" he says. \"I don't go wild. When me and my partner go away, half the stuff we take is to help us manage our migraines. On a recent stag-do weekend, Nick noticed the difference between his and his friends' lives. \"They were up all night drinking to the early hours,\" Nick says. \"I turned up with my own pillow, apples, bananas, Weetabix, and any snacks I would need to keep me going, because hunger can be a major trigger. \"I'm in bed by midnight - but my mates know me, and that's OK, because this is how I have to live my life.\" The comedian says he hopes to destigmatise mental health issues by being open about his own experiences. Retailers will no longer be able to sell single-use vapes as new laws come into force across the UK. Jessica Morgan-Helliwell admits she would rather meet her mates for a pastry than a pint. The business hopes to add to the £400,000 that has already been collected. Seed oils like canola and sunflower oil have attracted controversial claims about harmful effects in recent times.

    "title": "IFS says tough public spending choices unavoidable",
    "article_text": "Tough choices are \"unavoidable\" as the government finalises spending plans for areas ranging from the NHS and defence, to schools and the criminal justice system, a think tank has warned. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the level of spending on health would dictate whether cuts were made to \"unprotected\" areas – those outside the NHS, defence and schools. While funding increased sharply in 2024 for transport, net zero, hospitals, schools and prisons, it would no longer increase year on year, given the government's commitments, the IFS said. The government said the Spending Review on 11 June would \"scrutinise every single pound the government spends\". The review will outline day-to-day departmental budgets over the next three years and investment budgets over the next four. Whitehall insidershave told the BBCthey expect it will be \"ugly\", and that ministers have been fighting over winning small amounts of cash for their respective departments. There are concerns that plans such as increasing police numbers in a bid to halve violence against women and girls may not be allocated enough cash. There are also discussions over continued funding for capping bus fares. Chancellor Rachel Reeves stance on ruling out borrowing more money and not raising taxes again has led to strong speculation spending cuts will be made. The Conservatives say Reeves is only left with these seemingly \"impossible choices\" because she \"chose to push borrowing and spending to the limit\". \"They have pushed up the cost of living, unemployment is rising, growth is stalling,\" shadow chancellor Mel Stride said. \"And yet Rachel Reeves still clings to her tax-and-spend dogma like it's the 1970s.\" The IFS said the government had \"front-loaded\" its spending over the course of the parliament term in the first couple of years, which meant spending would slow down. \"The consequences of this decision must be confronted,\" the IFS warned. When it comes to daily spending on public services, the think tank suggested a \"huge amount depends on the generosity\" of cash handed to the NHS - which accounts for 39% of day-to-day departmental spending - as well as defence. NHS spending is planned to be £202bn in 2025-2026, the IFS said, which could pull funding from other areas as the government prioritises reducing patient waiting times and improving access to dental care. \"Increasing health funding at anything like the historical average rate would mean imposing real-terms cuts on other 'unprotected' departments,\" the think tank said. It said this would prove challenging, especially given the government's ambitions to improve the criminal justice system and to deal with prison overcrowding. The IFS added the level of health spending was \"in some sense, the central trade-off for the Spending Review\" and one that would only become starker if defence spending was increased further or faster than currently planned. Bee Boileau, a research economist at IFS, said the Treasury faced \"some unavoidably tough choices\". \"After turning on the spending taps last autumn, the flow of additional funding is now set to slow to more of a trickle,\" she said. The government has committed to increasing spending on the army and its estates, and announced it would cut the foreign aid budget toincrease military spending to 2.5%of national income by 2027. \"Giving more to defence means, all else equal, bigger cuts to something else,\" the IFS said. In October,Reeves changed a self-imposed debt rule, freeing up billions for her to spend on long-term projects such as roads and energy infrastructure, but the IFS warned \"not everything can be a priority for further increases\". It said questions remained about \"whether the trade-offs will be confronted rather than wished away\". To continue to improve public services under tight restraints, the IFS suggested the government could improve productivity, thereby allowing it to deliver the same, or better services within lower budgets. But that would be a challenge.The ONS reported in 2024that productivity in public services is currently below pre-Covid pandemic levels. A government spokesperson said it was \"delivering what matters for working people – cutting hospital waiting lists, getting control of our borders and tackling the cost of living\". The IFS warned choosing to cut public sector pay has led to strikes in the recent past, so keeping pay flat would \"pose serious challenges\". It concluded that cuts to public services would not be impossible to make, but would be challenging and require \"ruthless prioritisation\". Cash Access UK wants to convert an \"underused office\" away from Crowthorne Baptist Church itself. The number of new vehicles made in the UK was the lowest figure for April - outside the pandemic - since 1952. The government says its overhaul of retirement savings will boost growth and pension pots. Tiffany Bramley was rejected for a loan to re-start her business after missing payments when her daughter died. In its annual health-check for the UK economy, the IMF predicted growth of 1.2%, a marginal upgrade to its previous forecast.",

    "article_text": "At least seven people have died after a highway bridge collapsed on to railway tracks in Russia close to the Ukraine border, according to emergency services. The bridge in Bryansk brought down several heavy trucks on to a moving passenger train as it collapsed late on Saturday night, with 31 people also reportedly injured. The Russian Emergencies Ministry said fire and rescue units were attempting to find people who had been travelling on the train. In a statement posted to Telegram, Moscow Railway alleged the bridge had collapsed \"as a result of illegal interference in transport operations\". Hours later on Sunday morning, a second bridge also collapsed along the Trosna-Kalinovka highway in the Kursk region, according to Alexander Khinshtein, the acting governor of Kursk Oblast. A freight train had been travelling over the bridge at the time, he said, adding that part of the train had fallen onto the road below. The train caught fire, Khinshtein said, and a driver suffered injuries to his legs. Pictures online from the first incident in Bryansk showed mangled carriages and passengers helping each other climb out of the wreckage in the dark. Local governor Alexander Bogomaz said on Telegram there were \"seven fatalities\" and two people - including a child - were \"seriously injured\". All injured passengers have been taken to medical facilities in the Bryansk region, he added. Moscow's interregional transport prosecutor's office said an investigation had been launched. Authorities said the train's locomotive and several cars derailed when the road bridge fell on to it. Additional emergency workers, as well as rescue equipment and light towers for carrying out work at night have been sent to the area, according to Russian news agency Tass. The train was going from the town of Klimovo to Moscow and was in the Vygonichsky district when the collapse happened, officials said. Passengers were evacuated and guided to a meeting point at a nearby station, Moscow Railway said, adding: \"They will be able to continue their journey on a specially formed reserve train\" travelling from Bryansk to Moscow. The incident took place about 100km (62 miles) from the Ukraine border.",

    "title": "These women helped bring down a president - now they say they feel invisible",
    "article_text": "An Byunghui was in the middle of a video game on the night of 3 December when she learned that the South Korean president had declared martial law. She couldn't quite believe it - until the internet blew up with the evidence. The shock announcement from then-president Yoon Suk Yeol, the now-famous shots of soldiers breaking down the windows of the National Assembly and MPs scaling the walls to force their way into the building so they could vote the motion down. Within hours, thousands had spurred into protest, especially young women. And Byunghui joined them, travelling hundreds of miles from Daegu in the south-east to the capital Seoul. They turned up not just because Yoon's decision had alarmed and angered them, but to protest against a president who insisted South Korea was free of sexism - despite the deep discrimination and flashes of violence that said otherwise. They returned week after week as the investigation into Yoon's abuse of power went on - and they rejoiced when he was impeached after four dramatic months. And yet, with the country set to elect a new president on 3 June, those very women say they feel invisible again. The two main candidates have been largely silent about equality for women. A polarising subject, it had helped Yoon into power in 2022 as he vowed to defend men who felt sidelined in a world that they saw as too feminist. And a third candidate, who is popular among young men for his anti-feminist stance, has been making headlines. For many young South Korean women, this new name on the ballot symbolises a new fight. \"So many of us felt like we were trying to make the world a better place by attending the [anti-Yoon] rallies,\" the 24-year-old college student says. \"But now, I wonder if anything has really improved… I can't shake the feeling that they're trying to erase women's voices.\" When Byunghui arrived at the protests, she was struck by the atmosphere. The bitter December cold didn't stop tens of thousands of women from gathering. Huddling inside hooded jackets or under umbrellas, waving lightsticks and banners, singing hopeful K-pop numbers, they demanded Yoon's ouster. \"Most of those around me were young women, we were singing 'Into the World' by Girls' Generation,\" Byunghui says. Into the World, a hit from 2007 by one of K-pop's biggest acts, became an anthem of sorts in the anti-Yoon rallies. Women had marched to the same song nearly a decade ago in anti-corruption protests that ended another president's career. \"The lyrics - about not giving up on this world and dreaming of a new world,\" Byunghui says, \"just overwhelmed me. I felt so close to everyone\". There are no official estimates of how many of the protesters were young women. Approximately one in three were in their 20s or 30s, according to research by local news outlet Chosun Daily. An analysis by BBC Korean found that women in their 20s were the largest demographic at one rally in December, where there were 200,000 of them - almost 18% of those in attendance. In comparison, there were just over 3% of men in their 20s at that rally. The protests galvanised women in a country where discrimination, sexual harassment and even violence against them has long been pervasive, and the gender pay gap - at 31% - is the widest among rich nations. Like in so many other places, plummeting birth rates in South Korea too have upped the pressure on young women to marry and have children, with politicians often encouraging them to play their part in a patriarchal society. \"I felt like all the frustration that has built up inside me just burst forth,\" says 23-year-old Kim Saeyeon . \"I believe that's why so many young women turned up. They wanted to express all that dissatisfaction.\" For 26-year-old Lee Jinha, it was the desire to see Yoon go: \"I tried to go every week. It wasn't easy. It was incredibly cold, super crowded, my legs hurt and I had a lot of work to do… but it was truly out of a sense of responsibility.\" That is not surprising, according to Go Min-hee, associate professor of political science at Ewha Women's University, who says Yoon had the reputation of being \"anti-feminist\" and had \"made it clear he was not going to support policies for young women\". There were protests on the other side too, backing Yoon and his martial law order. Throughout, many young South Korean men have supported Yoon, who positioned himself as a champion of theirs, mirroring their grievances in his presidential campaign in 2022. These men consider themselves victims of \"reverse discrimination\", saying they feel marginalised by policies that favour young women. One that is often cited is the mandatory 18 months they must spend in the military, which they believe puts them at a severe disadvantage compared to women. They label as \"man haters\" those women who call themselves feminists. And they have been at the heart of a fierce online backlash against calls for greater gender equality. These groups have long existed, mostly out of the public eye. But over the years they moved closer to the mainstream as their traction online grew, especially under Yoon. It was them that Yoon appealed to in his campaign pledges, vowing to abolish the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, saying it focused too much on women's rights. And he consistently denied systemic gender inequality existed in South Korea, which ranks near the bottom on the issue among developed countries. But his message hit home. A survey by a local newspaper the year before he was elected had found that 79% of young men in their 20s felt \"seriously discriminated against\" because of their gender. \"In the last presidential election, gender conflict was mobilised by Yoon's party,\" says Kim Eun-ju, director of the Center for Korean Women and Politics. \"They actively strengthened the anti-feminist tendencies of some young men in their 20s.\" During Yoon's term, she says, government departments or publicly-funded organisations with the word \"women\" in their title largely disappeared or dropped the reference altogether. The impact has been polarising. It alienated young women who saw this as a rollback of hard-won rights, even as it fuelled the backlash against feminism. Byunghui saw this up-close back home in Daegu. She says anti-Yoon protests were overwhelmingly female. The few men who came were usually older. Young men, she adds, even secondary school students, would often drive past the protests she attended cursing and swearing at them. She says some men even threatened to drive into the crowd. \"I wondered if they would have acted this way had the protest been led by young men?\" With Yoon gone, his People Power Party (PPP) is in disarray and still reeling from his fall. And this is the first time in 18 years that there is no woman among the seven candidates runnning for president. \"It's shocking,\" Jinha says, \"that there's no-one\". In the last election, there were two women among 14 presidential candidates. The PPP's Kim Moon-soo is trailing frontrunner Lee Jae-myung, from the main opposition Democratic Party (DP). But young women tell the BBC they have been disappointed by 61-year-old Lee. \"It's only after criticism that that there were no policies targeting women that the DP began adding a few,\" Saeyeon says. \"I wish they could have drawn a blueprint for improving structural discrimination.\" When he was asked at the start of his campaign about policies targeting gender inequality, Lee responded: \"Why do you keep dividing men and women? They are all Koreans.\" After drawing critcism, the DP acknowledged that women still \"faced structural discrimination in many areas\". And it pledged to tackle inequality for women with more resources at every level. During his presidential bid in 2022, Lee was more vocal about the prejudice South Korean women encounter, seeking their votes in the wake ofhigh-profile sexual harassment scandalsin his party. He had promised to put women in top positions in the government and appointed a woman as co-chair of the DP's emergency committee. \"It's evident that the DP is focusing significantly less on young women than they did in the [2022] presidential election,\" Ms Kim says. Prof Go believes it's because Lee \"lost by a very narrow margin\" back then. So this time, he is \"casting the widest net possible\" for votes. \"And embracing feminist issues is not a good strategy for that.\" That stings for young women like Saeyeon, especially after the role they played in the protests calling for Yoon's impeachment: \"Our voices don't seem to be reflected in the [campaign] pledges at all. I feel a bit abandoned.\" The ruling party's Kim Moon-soo, who served in Yoon's cabinet as labour minister, has emphasised raising birth rates by offering more financial support to parents. But many women say rising costs are not the only obstacle. And that most politicians don't address the deeper inequalities - which make it hard to balance a career and family - that are making so many women reconsider the usual choices. The Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, which Yoon had wanted to shut down, has also re-emerged as a sticking point. Lee has vowed to strengthen the ministry, while Kim says he will replace it with a Ministry of Future Youth and Family. The ministry already focuses on family services, education and welfare for children. Just under 7% of its total funding, which is about 0.2% of the government's annual budget, goes towards improving equality for women. But Prof Go says the ministry was \"politicised by Yoon and has since been weaponised\". \"The ministry itself is not huge but it's symbolic… abolishing it would show that gender equality is unimportant.\" It's also the target of a third candidate, 40-year-old Lee Jun-seok, a former leader of Yoon's party, who has since launched his own Reform Party. Although trailing Kim in polls, Lee Jun-seok has been especially popular with many young men for his anti-feminist views. Earlier this week, he drew swift outrage after a presidential debate in which he said: \"If someone says they want to stick chopsticks in women's genitals or some place like that, is that misogyny?\" He said the \"someone\" was frontunner Lee Jae-myung's son, who he claimed made the comment online, an allegation which the Lee camp has sidestepped, apologising for other controversial posts. But watching Lee Jun-seok say that on live TV \"was genuinely terrifying,\" Byunghui says. \"I had the scary thought that this might boost incel communities.\" Saeyeon describes \"anger and even despair\" sinking the \"hopes I had for politics, which weren't that great to begin with\". She believes his popularity \"among certain sections of young men is one of the \"significant repercussions\" of South Korea \"long neglecting structural discrimination\" against women. The only candidate to address the issue, 61-year-old Kwon Young-gook, didn't fare well in early polling. \"I'm still deliberating whether to vote for Lee Jae-myung or Kwon Young-gook,\" Saeyeon says. While Kwon represents her concerns, she says it's smart to shore up the votes for Lee because she is \"much more afraid of the next election, and the one after that\". She is thinking about Lee Jun-seok, who some analysts believe could eat into the votes of a beleagured PPP, while appealing to Yoon's base: \"He is in the spotlight and as the youngest candidate, he could have a long career ahead.\" That is all the more reason to keep speaking out, Byunghui says. \"It's like there is dust on the wall. If you don't know it's there, you can walk by, but once you see it, it sticks with you.\" It's the same for Jinha who says things can \"never go back to how they were before Yoon declared martial law\". That was a time when politics felt inaccessible, but now, Jinha adds, it \"feels like something that affects me and is important to my life\". She says she won't give up because she wants to be free of \"things like discrimination at work… and live my life in peace\". \"People see young women as weak and immature but we will grow up - and then the world will change again.\" The neighbouring countries have long been embroiled in a war of information. But has there been a recent shift in who has the ‘upper hand’? After months of political turmoil, we asked people in Seoul if they plan to vote in the upcoming election. A political implosion turned controversial politician Lee Jae-myung into a presidential favourite. The vote comes after the impeachment and removal of former president Yoon Suk Yeol. Hundreds made damning allegations of fraud, kidnapping and trafficking about an overseas adoption programme.",

    "title": "Met Office sees greater chance of hot summer and heatwaves",
    "article_text": "The UK is more likely to experience a hotter-than-normal summer with an increased chance for heatwaves, according to the Met Office. In its most recent three month outlook, it has predicted that meteorological summer - which runs from 1 June to 31 August - is twice as likely to be hotter than normal in 2025. The prediction follows an unprecedented spring which was the sunniest, as well as one of the driest and warmest, on record. Sunny skies in May meant daytime temperatures were largely above the seasonal average Seasonal, or long-range forecasts look at the expected general weather patterns over a three month period and are run by most major weather agencies separately to the detailed daily forecasts. Due to the time frames and model resolution involved they are not able to tell if it will rain on a particular day or place in say seven weeks' time, but offer insights into how temperature, rainfall and wind strengths may compare to conditions normally expected over the entire period. These sorts of forecasts are helpful planning tools for government, local authorities and businesses. Having looked at forecasts from a number of different global forecast centres there appears to be one common message, that the UK is likely to experience a summer that is \"hotter than normal\", with theMet Office saying there is more than double the normal chance of this.,external Forecast temperature anomalies across the world for the northern hemisphere summer shows most areas are likely to see a warmer than normal season This may not come as a huge surprise as it is very much in line with previous summers. In fact the last time the UK experienced one that could be classed as \"cool\" was back in 2015. This does not necessarily mean that we will experience hot weather or heatwaves this summer, only that the risk of them occurring, and the health and infrastructure impacts they bring is greater. Variations within the summer period are still likely too. So what is set to drive the expected warmth? With no strong signal for any particular weather pattern evident, the Met Office says that the warming is being largely brought about by human-induced climate change. On a more local level, the ongoingmarine heatwavein the seas around the UK may also help to boost the temperatures. The added warmth and moisture they may bring could potentially lead to more intense summer storms. A simple guide to climate change Four ways climate change worsens extreme weather River and reservoir levels dropped across the UK during spring following a lack of rain Low reservoir levels and reduced river flows have become commonplace across the UK due to a spring deficient in rain. Many water companies will be hoping for a wet summer to redress the balance and help avoid the need to introduce restrictions to water usage in the months ahead. However, the seasonal forecasts are a lot less clear in how much rain we are likely to get. Most point to near-average rainfall for the UK as a whole, with the Met Office hinting at the possibility it will be wetter than average, especially in the first half of June. Agencies such as the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and DTN, the BBC's data suppliers, side more towards a slightly drier than normal season overall. Drought declared across north-west England Why are parts of the North more at risk of drought? Record low rivers prompt drought experts meeting Whatever the eventual outcome for the UK as a whole the often showery nature of summer rain means there can still be huge variations from one week to the next and from one region to another. A marked example of this was in 2021 when some parts of southern England had around double their normal summer rainfall while much of western Scotland had barely half. A consequence of a potentially hotter summer is that when rain does occur it will be more intense, in line with climate scientists' predictions, and potentially have bigger localised impacts. Met Office seasonal forecasts also look at the probability of wind strengths across the season. At the moment there is no strong signal one way or another to whether it will be a windy season or not. This may indicate that the likelihood of deep low pressure systems regularly crossing the UK is low. An active Atlantic hurricane season is forecastbut it remains to be seen what impact that will have on us, especially later in the summer when decaying tropical storms can come closer to our shores.

    "title": "Parties jockey for power in Hamilton  by-election",
    "article_text": "The famous Hamilton Park Racecourse lies on the edge of town, just beyond the boundary of the Holyrood constituency where voters are set to elect a new MSP. Its presence is a useful reminder that few places in Scotland are as familiar with runners and riders, favourites and outsiders. The current political race in this former coal mining heartland of west central Scotland will decide who represents Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse in the Scottish Parliament following the death of the SNP's Christina McKelvie. It also has wider significance. It is the largest test of voter opinion in Scotland since the UK general election in which Labour heavily defeated the SNP. It is also the first real opportunity to see if Reform UK's recent successes in England can give them what they call a \"tartan bounce\". The outcome will help shape the political narrative in Scotland ahead of the national Holyrood election next May. While Hamilton has its place in the history of horse racing, it has also earned iconic status when it comes to jockeying for political power. It was here that Winnie Ewing made her stunning by-election breakthrough for the SNP in 1967. It was this town that gave the former NATO secretary general Lord Robertson his start at Westminster in 1978. It was the people of Hamilton South who elected Labour's Tom McCabe as the first MSP in 1999. Driving around what is now the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse constituency, you would be forgiven for thinking the 2025 contest was a two horse race between the SNP and Reform UK. That's only because these are the parties dominating billboard advertising. This observation takes no account of the intensive door knocking, direct mailing and social media campaigning that's been going on for weeks. The SNP leader John Swinneyhas certainly acknowledged a third, red rosette-wearing horse in this race. My sense is that his comment came as something of a relief to Scottish Labour, who came second last time and expect to be regarded as the principal challenger to the SNP, who are defending the seat. Labour could certainly do with a win here. Having swept to power at Westminster last summer, Sir Keir Starmer's party quickly lost popularity with decisions like cutting winter fuel payments for pensioners. Even though changes to that policy have been promised, they will come too late for this by-election. The damage to Scottish Labour seems to have been done. The SNP tends to have a double digit lead over Labour in national opinion polls, with support for pro-UK parties heavily fragmented since the rise of Reform. That means that with around a third of the vote, the SNP can still be winners because Reform UK is principally drawing support away from the Conservatives and Labour. The arithmetic already takes into account a series of SNP controversies over independence strategy, gender self-identification, a police investigation into party finances, leadership changes and the collapse of a power-sharing deal with the Greens. These are challenging conditions for Scottish Labour to regain power at Holyrood after nearly two decades in the wilderness. That is the national picture suggested by a relatively limited number of opinion polls. This election is for a single constituency for which no formal polling has been published. In other words, there is plenty of room for surprise, especially if voters stay at home and turnout is low. At the start of this by-election campaign, a Labour source told me they would have a chance if the focus was on the SNP's record in government - on issues like long waits for NHS treatment. The same source said that if the vote became a referendum on Labour's first months in power at Westminster they would be in big trouble. Labour insiders now say they have identified enough potential support to win in Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse if (and it could be a big if) they can mobilise voters to turn out. By contrast, SNP campaigners say they are \"ahead\" while acknowledging that the buzz around Reform UK following their successes in English local and mayoral elections throws in an \"unknown\" factor. This is a contest that nobody wanted and there appears to be little enthusiasm for the political choice on offer. A senior figure in the SNP told me they had found voters angry with Labour but far from impressed with the SNP. Many of the locals who stopped to chat with me in the centre of Hamilton were thoroughly fed up with politicians of all stripes. Elizabeth O'Donohue seemed to speak for many when she said: \"I think they're all as bad as each other.\" Des McDonagh, who has voted SNP in the past and tried Labour in 2024, said he was now \"totally dismayed with the options available\". Nicole Copland accused politicians of making \"false promises\" to reduce the cost of living and said that when she votes \"things don't really change\". Rising household bills, access to healthcare, taxes on small businesses and revitalising town centres are all issues that have come up in this campaign. The public frustration with established parties is palpable and this is where Reform UK has spotted an opportunity. They have no track record of election, never mind government, at any level in Scotland. Their key figures are councillors who have defected from the Scottish Conservatives. The party is now targeting Labour voters with their UK leader Nigel Farage arguing for the threshold at which working people begin paying tax to be raised to £20,000. He wants tighter controls on immigration and the asylum system to help pay for this change. Across parties in Scotland, there is an acknowledgement that immigration is being raised by voters more than in the past. That is a policy area controlled by Westminster rather than Holyrood but that does not prevent discussion. In this campaign, Reform UK has claimed that the Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar would \"prioritise the Pakistani community\". That is the interpretation Reform has placed on a speech Mr Sarwar gave in 2022 at an event celebrating 75 years of Pakistan's independence - despite him not actually using those words in the clips they have chosen to promote on social media. They have beenaccused of racismby the SNP, Labour and the Greens, with the Liberal Democrats attacking Reform UK for \"scummy tactics\". The Conservatives under the leadership of Russell Findlay have largely kept out of the row. Bydoubling down on this claimNigel Farage attracted fresh ire from Holyrood politicians, amplifying what appears to be an attempt to motivate voters for whom immigration is a concern. I saw examples of support for Reform in this constituency and also heard voters express disgust at the party's rhetoric. Reform's minimum ambition here is to finish third and push the Conservatives into fourth place - a potential outcome for which the Scottish Tories appear to be braced. Pundits, pollsters and political journalists will analyse the results carefully for insights into voter behaviour with less than a year until every Holyrood seat comes up for grabs. If the SNP hold on, that would compound the sense that although the party is far less popular than it has been, John Swinney could still be first minister after next year's Holyrood vote. If Labour take the seat, that would confound those who have come to believe that Anas Sarwar and his team will struggle to build sufficient support to be competitive in that contest. Anything other than an SNP or Labour win in Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse would be a huge political upset. That doesn't mean that whatever happens in this by-election will be replicated in the national election. They are not the same thing and voting patterns vary across the country. In the Hamilton area, candidates and boundaries change over time but this corner of Scotland's post-industrial centre is a consistent source of political intrigue. That remains the case as voters prepare for their next moment in the political spotlight. There are a total of10 candidates contesting this by-electionon Thursday 5 June. They are: A judge will be asked to decide whether the trial of the man accused of building the bomb can be delayed until next April.

    "title": "'Our love is frowned upon, but we push through': Navigating religion and relationships",
    "article_text": "It was love at first sight for Adarsh Ramchurn. \"I couldn't control it,\" he says of his flourishing affection for Nav Sangha. But their relationship is \"frowned upon\" by some in their communities, they say, as Adarsh is Hindu and Nav is Sikh. They've been an item for three years and say they receive hateful comments on social media when posting about their life together. They are also abused because Adarsh, 24, has a darker skin tone than Nav,a form of prejudice known as colourism. \"We push through it,\" says Nav, 22. \"There are also people who are very supportive and that are in similar situations.\" Data compiled by YouGov in January suggests 45% of 18 to 24-year-olds in the UK believe there is a God, or believe there are Gods. The next highest figure, 36%, is for the over-65s. BBC News spoke to Nav and Adarsh as well as a Christian from Married At First Sight (MAFS), a Muslim from The Only Way is Essex  (Towie), and a former Jehovah's Witness for theSex After documentary series. During a discussion between the participants, Nav was asked what the hardest bit about being a Sikh was. \"Probably getting the backlash of being with a Hindu,\" she said. She and Ardash knew their interfaith relationship could be an issue for their parents, so spoke to them early. \"I know it's different for every family, there can be difficult dynamics,\" says Adarsh. \"But if you can have the open discussion [about] dating outside of your religion… I'd always say [you should].\" Something Adarsh's parents were quick to ask him about was marriage. The couple say, if they were to wed, they would probably do a Sikh and a Hindu ceremony. \"If we have kids, I feel like it's important that they learn about both religions and faiths,\" Nav adds. Adarsh agrees and says he's \"looking forward to it\". Junaid Ahmed's parents were not as accommodating. His fear of being rejected by them took hold at a young age. Junaid  knew being gay contravened the Islamic beliefs he and his family shared. \"When I did finally come out [aged 18], I did expect the worst and… [it] did happen,\" he tells us. \"They threw me out; they disowned me.\" He says he doesn't blame his parents for ostracising him. \"I genuinely don't - it's made me the person I am today.\" Junaid, now aged 26 and a star of Towie, says he often gets abuse online from other Muslims because he is open about his sexual orientation, but \"that [has] never changed my relationship with God\". He says he is grateful for his religious upbringing and still prays everyday. Like Junaid, Martin Riley - who was brought up a Jehovah's Witness - was also ostracised by his family. However, in his case, it was because a few years ago he was expelled from his religion completely,in a process called disfellowshipping. For Riley, as he is known to his friends, this meant being shunned by other members of his congregation - including close friends and family. His first marriage, which lasted 20 years, had broken down a few months before he was expelled. He was a particularly strong believer and, while dating after he was expelled, he abided by the rule of not having sex before marriage. It was only when Riley began dating the woman who is now his wife, that he began seriously considering whether he wanted to continue adhering to the religion that he'd been part of for 40 years. His wife is not a Jehovah's Witness. \"I realised that I did not want to have a future that didn't include her, whether that meant returning to the religion or not.\" After having sex with her for the first time, which he describes as being, \"like in the movies\", he recalls: \"I was actually surprised by how guiltless I felt about the whole thing.\" Riley, 48, now considers himself an atheist. Looking back at his expulsion from the religion aged 42, he says: \"It was devastating for me, at the time. Now I think it is probably one of the best things to ever happen to me.\" Unlike Riley, Sacha Jones did not grow up devoutly religious, but was baptised as a Christian last year after finding her faith. She has vowed to remain abstinent until she marries. \"I haven't slept with anyone since my baptism,\" she says. \"So I'm fresh in the eyes of the Lord!\" Sacha, 30, also says the culture around dating today makes it difficult to form a  long-term relationship. Last year she participated in MAFS, but split up with her partner following the show. \"It's the absolute trenches out here in the dating world… it's difficult to trust a man anyway, but then to trust someone that doesn't fear God as well?\" She says she doesn't miss sex as much as she might do because she isn't dating anyone at the moment. She believes the wait will be worth it - once she's married. \"I no longer lack purpose or peace,\" says Sacha, who isn't the \"party animal\" she once was.  \"I'm happier than I've ever been.\" The treatment will be offered to those most at risk from August after a record number of cases.

    "title": "The Mississippi town behind the box office hit Sinners",
    "article_text": "When Edna Nicole Luckett sings the Blues on the stage at Red's, her voice, deep and soulful, echoes against the walls. The juke joint in Clarksdale, Mississippi is one of the last of its kind in the region, a landmark for a bygone era of American music. \"I was raised in Delta dirt, sunshine and flatland that goes on for miles and miles,\" she sings, as people nod their heads and stomp their feet to the beat. Ms Luckett, like many who were raised in the Mississippi Delta, grew up listening to locally-crafted Blues music and singing in her church choir. It's experiences like hers - and places like Red's - that are getting a fresh moment to shine with the box office success of Ryan Coogler's film Sinners. The genre-defying film has earned more than $300 million (£22 million) globally, against a $90m (£67m) budget, and attracted the world's attention to a historic small town. For the those who live there - and especially those who still sing the Blues - the spotlight is welcome, in no small part because of Coogler's careful respect for their history. \"I'm protective of how the Mississippi Delta is represented,\" Ms Luckett said. Clarksdale was the place where blues legends like Sam Cooke, Johnny Lee Hooker and Muddy Waters got their start, but its significance was mostly known to music lovers. Like other small towns in the US south, Clarksdale has faced struggles. The town, home to 14,000 people, lost its only movie theatre in 2003.  That meant that residents couldn't even watch Sinners in their hometown - until now. After a local appeal, Mr Coogler agreed to bring the film to town for six free showings this past week. The charge was led by Tyler Yarbrough, a Clarksdale native, who wrote a public letter to the director after seeing the movie in a nearby town. Set in 1932, Sinners tells the story of twin brothers, both played by Michael B Jordan, who return home to Clarksdale after World War One. Combining elements of musicals, horror and period drama, the movie fuses vampire lore with meticulous historic research about that time and place in America. \"Beneath the horror and fantasy, your film captures the soul of this place: our history, our struggles, our genius, our joy, our community,\" Mr Yarbrough wrote. He told the BBC he was moved to see this place represented with careful detail. \"It was time traveling back to 1930's in Clarksdale, in our town, so this is the lives of my great grandma,\" he said. \"The history from the farms to the juke joints was on full display.\" Mr Coogler, who also made Black Panther and Creed, said it was his Uncle James, a Mississippi native who loved Delta Blues, who helped inspire the film. Although the movie was ultimately filmed in Louisiana, he visited Clarksdale to do extensive research. \"I never got to come here until working on this script,\" Mr Coogler told a crowd of 1,500 on Thursday. \"It blew my mind — I got to meet musicians, I got to meet community members. It really changed me just to come here and do the research.\" While some remnants of the town depicted in the film remain, like many towns in America, its storefronts have been emptied and modernised - though it still enjoys tourist interest for its history. Odes to some of Clarksdale's blues legends, like Robert Johnson, are colourfully painted onto the sides of buildings, reminding people of the history of the streets where they walk. One of those streets used to be home to Delta Blues Alley Cafe, a blues joint owned by Jecorry Miller that burned to the ground last month. Mr Miller wants people to have a better understanding of the history that lives on the streets on Clarksdale and the movie is a way to grasp that. \"The movie itself is going to be great for the town - we get nine times the population of our city that comes to visit the city every year, now it could be ten or 11 times the population that visits Clarksdale,\" Mr Miller said. \"People being here spending their dollars is a great thing for us.\" And local residents said the attention is all the more welcome because they see themselves and their culture in the film. At the Thursday screening, longtime Clarksdale residents relished the details. Ms Luckett, the Blues singer, was listening to make sure the characters' dialect sounded right. She watched to see if the land in the backdrop of the film was as flat and green as it is in real life. \"It was,\" she said with a smile. John Miller and Chinese man Cui Guanghai are in custody in Serbia facing a US extradition request.

    "title": "US sends nuclear deal proposal to Iran",
    "article_text": "The US has sent Iran a proposal for a nuclear deal between Tehran and Washington, the White House confirmed on Saturday. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said he had been presented with \"elements of a US deal\" by his Omani counterpart Badr Albusaidi during a short visit to the Iranian capital. It comes aftera report by the UN nuclear watchdog saidIran had further stepped up its production of enriched uranium, a key component in the making of nuclear weapons. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Saturday it was in Tehran's \"best interest to accept\" the deal, adding: \"President Trump has made it clear that Iran can never obtain a nuclear bomb\". Leavitt said a \"detailed and acceptable\" proposal had been sent to Iran by US President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff. The US proposal \"will be appropriately responded to in line with the principles, national interests and rights of the people of Iran\", Araghchi wrote on X. The precise details of the deal are not yet clear. The proposal follows a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) - seen by the BBC - which found Iran now possesses over 400kg of uranium enriched to 60% purity - close to the 90% purity required for weapons-grade uranium. This is well above the level of purity sufficient for civilian nuclear power and research purposes. It is enough for about 10 nuclear weapons if further refined, making Iran the only non nuclear-armed state producing uranium at this level. The report paves the way for the US, Britain, France and Germany to push for the IAEA's board of governors to find Iran in violation of its non-proliferation obligations. Iran insists its programme is peaceful. On Saturday, Iranian state media described the IAEA report as \"politically motivated\" containing \"baseless accusations\". Iran has said it will \"implement appropriate measures\" in response to any effort to take action against Tehran at the IAEA governors' meeting. The US has long sought to limit Iran's nuclear capacity. Talks between the two powers mediated by Oman have been under way since April. Both sides have expressed optimism during the course of the talks but remain divided over key issues - chief among them, whether Iran can continue enrichment under any future agreement. Despite the ongoing negotiations between Tehran and Washington, the IAEA report offered no indication that Iran has slowed its nuclear enrichment efforts. Iran has produced highly enriched uranium at a rate equivalent to roughly one nuclear weapon per month over the past three months, the IAEA report found. US officials estimate that, if Iran chooses to make a weapon, it could produce weapons-grade material in less than two weeks and potentially build a bomb within months. Iran has long denied it is attempting to develop nuclear weapons. However, the IAEA said it could not confirm whether this was still the case because Iran refuses to grant access to senior inspectors and has not answered longstanding questions about its nuclear history. Trump is seeking a new nuclear agreement with Tehran after pulling the US out of a previous nuclear agreement between Iran and six world powers in 2018. This nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA, was signed in 2015 by Iran and the US, China, France, Russia, Germany and the UK. The JCPOA sought to limit and monitor Iran's nuclear programme in return for lifting sanctions that had been placed on the regime in 2010 over suspicions that its nuclear programme was being used to develop a bomb. But Donald Trump withdrew from the deal during his first term in office, claiming JCPOA was a \"bad deal\" because it was not permanent and did not address Iran's ballistic missile programme, amongst other things. Trump then re-imposed US sanctions as part of a \"maximum pressure\" campaign to compel Iran to negotiate a new and expanded agreement. In the intervening years, Tehran has steadily overstepped the 2015 agreement's limits on its nuclear programme, designed to make it harder to develop an atomic bomb. Trump has previously threatened to bomb Iran's nuclear facilities if diplomacy fails to achieve a deal. John Miller and Chinese man Cui Guanghai are in custody in Serbia facing a US extradition request. Ryan Coogler presented his smash-hit Sinners in Clarksdale, Mississippi, which served as inspiration for his genre-defying movie.

    "title": "‘We’ll determine our defence policy’: Albanese responds to US push for huge rise in spending as it stokes China fears",
    "article_text": "Anthony Albanese has responded to the United States’ calls for a huge rise in defence spending amid fears about China, while hitting back at Donald Trump’s move to double tariffs on steel and aluminium. On Saturday Pete Hegsethurged US allies in the region, including Australia, to “share the burden” and lift defence spending to 5% of GDP, warning that “Beijing is credibly preparing to potentially use military force to alter the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific”. “There’s no reason to sugar coat it,” he said. “The threatChinaposes is real, and it could be imminent.” Albanese said Australia had already committed to additional investment in defence and would “determine our defence policy”. “We’ll determine our defence policy, we’ve invested, just across [the next four years], an additional $10bn in defence,” the prime minister said on Sunday. “What we’ll do is continue to invest in our capability but also our relationships in the region. “Our position in regards to Taiwan is very clear, has been for a long time – a bipartisan position to support the status quo.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Australia is on track to lift defence spending to 2.4% of GDP by 2033-34, up from the approximately 2% it is on now. The Pentagon undersecretary Elbridge Colby has previously told a US Senate hearing that the US wanted Australia to reach a 3% defence spending threshold. On Sunday, Australia’sdefence minister, Richard Marlessaid the issue of defence spending was a conversation he was “totally up for”, noting Hegseth had raised it in talks. The head of China’s delegation at the conference dismissed Hegseth’s warnings as “groundless accusations” and “nothing more than attempts to provoke trouble, incite division and stir up confrontation to destabilise the Asia-Pacific region”,according to Associated Press. Marles noted that China had developed the single biggest increase in military capability by any country since WWII, and that it had occurred “without strategic reassurance” and “without a clear strategic intent”. The tussle comes as Donald Trumpannounced he would double steel and aluminium import tariffsworldwide from 25% to 50% from 4 June to “further secure” his country’s domestic industry. Albanese reiterated on Sunday that the president’s decision was an “an act of economic self-harm” and “inappropriate” for US consumers. The trade minister, Don Farrell, saidAustralia would “convince” the USto exempt Australia from the universal tariffs. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion “We’re going to coolly and calmly argue our case for the removal of these tariffs,” he said. The energy minister, Chris Bowen, told ABC’s Insiders on Sunday “all options” would be considered, including a World Trade Organization dispute, but the first step would be discussions with the US. Trump had saidhe would give “great consideration”to an exemption for Australia from steel and aluminium tariffs in February but ultimately decided against any exemptions. Albanese is expected to meet Trump in person for the first time since both leaders were re-elected on the sidelines of the G7 leaders’ summit in Canada this month. The shadow finance minister, James Paterson, said the US decision was “harmful” to its relationship with Australia and that the prime minister needed to “robustly defend” Australia’s interests. “[Albanese] should lay out the case to the president both why these tariffs are unwise and unjustified, generally, but particularly why they’re unjustified when it comes to Australia, a country with which the United States has a trade surplus,” he told Sky News on Sunday. Australia exports relatively little steel to the US. About 2.5% of US aluminium imports by volume come from Australia, but this is less than 10% of Australia’s total exports of the metal. The National party leader,David Littleproud, said Albanese should convince Trump of the seriousness of the decision and to return to “rules-based order of trade”. “We have a compelling case, to have a carve-out, even if you take away the insanity of these tariffs as a whole because of our relationship andthe cheque we just dropped for submarines with the United States,” he told Weekend Today.",

    "title": "‘Gut punch’: top shark expert quits Queensland advisory panel after LNP expands cull program",
    "article_text": "One of Australia’s leading shark researchers has resigned from his position of almost eight years advising theQueenslandshark control program, as members of that scientific working group say they were “shocked” and sidelined by the state government’s decision to expand the lethal control of sharks. Announcing an$88m shark management plan overhaulwhich would see shark nets and baited drum lines designed to kill target shark species rolled out at more beaches, and existing drum lines used more intensely, the primary industries minister, Tony Perrett, claimed this week that the Liberal National party’s strategy was backed by research. “I have said time and time again; the best science must inform our actions when it comes to Fisheries,” Perrett said on Sunday. But the expansion of the state’s shark cull was slammed by conservation groups such as Australian Marine Conservation Society as an “outdated” and “unscientific” approach that “does nothing to improve beach safety”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Amid the noisy backlash this week, marine science professor Colin Simpfendorfer quietly handed in his resignation from the scientific working group to Perrett. Simpfendorfer had been a member of the advisory body since its inception in 2017 and is regarded as one of the country’s foremost shark experts, having served asthe co-chair of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Species Survival Commission’s (IUCN SSC) shark specialist group. He declined to comment. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, however, several members of the working group said they advised against the expansion of lethal control and were not informed of the LNPs plans to do so until days before they were announced. “Everyone was shocked and everyone was pretty upset that there wasn’t consultation,” one working group member said. “We were told there was something coming and it was postponed and postponed and postponed. We kind of had the feeling that it was going to be bad … but it was a gut punch.” AMCS shark scientist and campaigner Dr Leonardo Guida said Simpfendorfer was “unequivocally” Australia’s most renowned and respected shark scientist. “I don’t think anyone would dispute the fact that Colin is, not just Australia’s best and most respected and well known shark scientist but, even globally, he is up there at the top,” he said. Guida said he would like to sincerely thank Simpfendorfer for his expertise and service in the “undoubtedly very challenging role” of providing scientific advice to “what is essentially a state sanctioned marine cull of sharks”. “As to what his resignation says, only a matter of days after Queensland’s announcement to extend the shark cull, my interpretation of that would be that the Queensland government has made a decision that is no longer in line with scientific advice and recommendation,” Guida said. “That this is a clear departure from scientific advice itself”. Several sources said that in its nearly eight years the working group had been successful in getting “more science into decision making” around shark management in Queensland and in moving from lethal to non-lethal shark control – but that Sunday’s announcement marked a “philosophical” shift from the top. Some attributed the shift to pressure from commercial and recreational anglers who reportincreasingly having fish taken from their lines by sharks. Many scientists agree this behaviour – known asshark depredation– is on the rise in many places around the world, though none spoken to for this article believe that a shark cull will have any impact on depredation rates, nor improve the safety of swimmers. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion Others said the decision was partly a reaction to a number of recent shark bites in Queensland, including that which killed17-year-old surf life saver Charlize Zmudawhile swimming at a Bribie Island beach in February, and that which killedyouth pastor Luke Walford, who was spear fishing in the Keppel Bay Islands last December. Bribie Island has baited drum lines, while the Keppel islands do not. Shark scientist and Emmy award-winning underwater cinematographer Richard Fitzpatrick, who has been on the scientific working group since its inception, says media reporting around fatal shark incidents may also have contributed to the expansion of lethal shark control measures. “Media hysteria in Australia is one of the biggest problems with the whole shark issue,” he said “Imagine if it were reported at the same level we do with car fatalities”. Fitzpatrick said the expansion of lethal shark measures had “definitely” made him consider his position on the working group, but said that, ultimately, working with the government had allowed scientists to pursue much-needed research into shark tracking and movement. Included in the government’s shark control plan, he said, was a survey of shark populations which would be “essential”, would “not be cheap” and “must be done properly”. “We haven’t had a stock assessment done on the target species in Queensland properly ever,” he said. “Getting that done is absolutely critical now”. “At the end of the day our approach is to do the best research possible.” Whether that research informs decision making or not, however, is a minister’s prerogative. The primary industries minister said he stood by his comments the shark control plan was backed by science in the wake of Simpfendorfer’s resignation. “The Crisafulli Government makes no apology for reaffirming the purpose of the Shark Control Management Plan 2025-2029 Plan to prioritise the safety of people above all else,” Perrett said. The minister said research showed anda recent KPMG reportconfirmed that “traditional methods (nets and drum lines) are still the most effective way of protecting swimmers”. “Until the new technology is scientifically proven as effective at protecting beach goers as traditional methods, we will continue to invest in what keeps Queenslanders and our beaches safe,” he said. The Queensland premier, David Crisafulli, defended his government’s policy on Sunday – but didn’t answer a question about whether the shark control program scientific working group had advised against it. He said Queensland’s shark program – including drum lines – had proven effective for half a century. “There is a way that we can continue to use new technology to make sure that we can strike a balance, but … for the sake of our tourism industry, for the sake of everyday Queenslanders, we have to make sure that we keep bolstering those defences,” he said.",

    "title": "This elusive possum was thought to be extinct outside Victoria. Now ecologists have made an ‘amazing’ discovery",
    "article_text": "A critically endangered possum species thought to be isolated to Victoria has been found in aNew South Walesalpine national park. Previously thought to be extinct in the state, aleadbeater’s possumhas been found in Kosciuszko national park, at least 250km away from the nearest sighting in Victoria. A trawl through millions of photos found seven images of the tiny creature over a 10-second span, with the Healesville Sanctuary and the Australian National University confirming the NSW environment department’s find. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The leadbeater’s possum, Victoria’s faunal emblem, has big eyes and a bushy tail. It relies on dense, damp areas in old-growth forest and nests in hollows that take more than 150 years to form. Dr Fred Ford, a senior threatened species officer at the NSW Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water, said it was “amazing to see that distinctive bushy tail waving among the rows of images on the screen”. “It jumped right out at me,” he said. “This discovery highlights that you have to be out there looking at the world to find these rare species. “You might not be specifically looking for what you find, but the more you look, particularly using modern techniques such as remote cameras and environmental DNA, the more chance you have to find them.” NSW Environment Minister Penny Sharpe labelled the find “extraordinary”. “For ecologists to spot a needle in a haystack of millions of images speaks to their commitment to the conservation cause and demonstrates that NSW government threatened species officers are doing some of the most incredible work,” she said. “This special find in Kosciuszko National Park once again highlights why the government is taking action to remove invasive species to protect Australia’s only mainland alpine region, which spans the NSW and Victorian border.” A recent survey foundthe national park’s brumby populationhad been drastically culled via aerial shooting, which Sharpe said was important in providing the right conditions for native species. Ecologists will review past surveys of Kosciuszko to see if more of the critically endangered possums can be spotted, along with putting in new cameras to help look for them. Leadbeater’s possums, known as “forest fairies” for their elusiveness, were thought to be extinct when they were rediscovered near Marysville in 1961. Fewer than 40 of the lowland subspecies exist today in a tract of the Yellingbo Forest, east of Melbourne, after most of its habitat was lost to logging and development.",

    "title": "Poland goes to the polls in second round of close-fought presidential election",
    "article_text": "Polls have opened inPolandfor the second round of the presidential election, with the two candidates offering radically different visions for the country locked in a dead heat. The race pits thepro-European Warsaw mayor, Rafał Trzaskowski, backed by Donald Tusk’s politically-diverse governing coalition, against the historian and former amateur boxer Karol Nawrocki, endorsed by the populist-right Law and Justice (PiS) party that governed the country between 2015 and 2023. While the role of the Polish president is largely ceremonial, it carries some influence over foreign and defence policy and a critical power to veto new legislation. This can only be overturned with a majority of three-fifths in parliament, which the current government does not have. At stake is whether Tusk’s government will be able to make progress on its electoral promises on the rule of law and social issues, including abortion and LGBTQ rights, after 18 months of difficult cohabitation with the opposition president, Andrzej Duda. A Nawrocki win would prolong the current deadlock, making it difficult for the government to pass any major reforms before the 2027 parliamentary election. “Tusk knows the stakes and that if Nawrocki wins, he’s got a lame-duck administration for the next couple of years. And it will be worse than with Duda as Nawrocki will come in fresh, with a new mandate from what effectively turned into a referendum on the government,” Prof Aleks Szczerbiak, who teaches east and central European politics at the University of Sussex, said. In the final days of the campaign, both candidates soughtto court voters of candidates knocked out in the first roundand mobilise their supporters, with analysts stressing that less than 200,000 votes could decide the outcome of the race. Polls showed the difference between the two candidates to be within the margin of error, making it the closest election in Poland’s post-1989 history. “The outcome is impossible to predict – there are too many moving parts, and even the slightest change on the day could tip the balance,” Ben Stanley, an associate professor at SWPS University in Warsaw, said. On Friday night, the country went into electoral silence, which forbids further campaigning and new polls. This left voters with little more than 24 hours to reflect on a brutal and polarising campaign. Trzaskowski, the Oxford-educated Warsaw mayor since 2018 who previously held ministerial posts and served in the European parliament, sought to project himself as a safe pair of hands to work with the government on implementing progressive reforms. However, his campaign faced difficulties because of close links to the unpopular Tusk government. He also had to defend himself against suggestions he is out-of-touch and elitist, and against allegations about foreign funding for online advertising promoting his candidacy. In turn, Nawrocki is new to politics. Since 2021, he has led the Institute of National Remembrance, a state research institute with public prosecution powers investigating historical crimes against Poland. Formally an independent but endorsed by PiS, he offers a new face to the party which is burdened by the polarising legacy of its eight years in power. He received public support from the US president,Donald Trump, and members of his administration, as well as the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán. But his campaign was beset with allegations of impropriety related to his past, including questions over his acquisition of an apartment from an older man and his admission that he took part in an organised fight between 140 football hooligans in his youth. A win for Nawrocki could alsoalter Poland’s supportive position toward Ukraine. He repeatedly spoke about the difficult history between the two nations and declared his opposition to Ukrainian membership in Nato. The polls will close at 9pm local time (8pm BST), with exit polls to follow. However, the race is expected to be too close to call, with the focus shifting to late polls and official results dripping in overnight.",

    "title": "Far right weaponising LGBTQ+ rights in Europe to sow division, campaigners say",
    "article_text": "Far-right politicians in Europe are weaponising LGBTQ+ rights and sowing divisions that are sending hate crimes soaring, campaigners have said as communities prepare to mark Pride month. For years, countries inEuropewere among those at the forefront of advancing rights, making steady progress on issues such as marriage equality, said Katrin Hugendubel of ILGA-Europe, an umbrella organisation that works with more than 700 groups across Europe and central Asia. In recent years, however, there has been a sharp reversal. “Not only is there a real non-advancement in legal protection, but laws are actually being taken away,” said Hugendubel. “And what we see is that, more and more, laws are being designed not to protect the fundamental rights of people nor to address any genuine societal needs, but purely to marginalise the community.” Examples span Europe. InHungaryandSlovakia,populist governments have sought to enshrine two genders in the constitution, a promise echoed by the far-right Austrian partythat wonthe most votes in the last election. In at least 10 European countries,includingItaly, Bulgaria and Romania, attempts have been made to introduce legislation barring LGBTQ+ topics from schools. This week, the Council of Europesaidtransphobic hate speech was rife in many European countries, with references to protecting children against “gender ideology” becoming what it described as a “recurring trend”. Earlier this year, Hungarybecame the firstcountry in the EU to ban events involving the LGBTQ+ community, in alegal changethat was codified just as Budapest Pride was preparing to mark its 30th year. Politicians themselves have used parliament, political rallies and media interviews to take aim at the community, fuelling anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment and normalising discrimination across the continent. The impacts had been wide-reaching, Hugendubel said. “It’s leading to more hate online and offline, and that’s leading to increasing violence.” A2024 surveyof more than 100,000 LGBTIQ people in 30 European countries found that reports of violence and harassment had reached new highs, with 14% of respondents saying they had been physically or sexually attacked in the five years prior to the survey. One in three said they had faced violence repeatedly. The findings highlighted how bullying, harassment and violence remained constant threats, said Sirpa Rautio, the director of the EU’s Fundamental Rights Agency, which carried out the survey. “Being openly LGBTIQ in Europe should not be a struggle,” Rautiosaid in a statement. While the rollback of rights has been most intense in central and eastern Europe, where rightwing politicians are gaining power, violence is rising across the continent, with countries includingFrance,Germany,BelgiumandSpainall reporting surges. Sign up toThis is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion Suicide rates has also risen amid the growing climate of discrimination, Hugendubel said, particularly in the trans community. “This kind of ongoing war that’s being waged against trans people is hitting very vulnerable young people who are trying to work out their gender identity, trying to find their space in society. The relentless hostility can have devastating effects on mental health, including increased risks of suicide,” she said. “It’s often forgotten, but that’s part of the story of the rise in hate as well.” She described the erosion of LGBTQ+ rights as a “canary in the mine”, as the same far-right governments go on to extend their attacks to academics, journalists and artists and undermine fair elections. “The community has been weaponised,” she said. “You’re scapegoating a community and you use that to create an us-against-them narrative to bind you to your own voters and build alliances that safeguard your own power.” The trans community had borne the brunt of this tactic as politicians seized on the fact that many people knew little about the community or trans rights, Hugendubel said. “It was an easy entry point to sow fear among people, to sow division,” she said. “So in that sense, it was a real instrumentalisation. You kind of take the weakest link and enter there to sow fears, to sow misinformation that then goes into broader attacks against the community, but also against human rights standards.” What had emerged was an “existential threat” for democracy, one that had made it imperative for the EU to take action to address the violation of fundamental rights, she said. In recent days, pressure has been growing on the EU to address the Hungarian government’s Pride ban, with 17 countriescalling on Brusselsto use all the legal tools at its disposal if Hungary does not revise the measures. So far, however, there has beenlittle responsefrom the upper echelons of the EU. As organisations across Europe geared up to markPride, all of this was weighing heavily on many, she said. “We’ve always said that Pride is a protest. In many countries with LGBTI rights advancing, Pride has luckily turned into a big celebration and a celebration of diversity in the community, which it should be as well.” But its roots in protest could not be forgotten, she said, particularly at a time when communities were grappling with scapegoating, hate speech and surging violence. “In the end, limiting Pride is not just limiting the visibility of LGBTI rights. It’s really limiting the freedom of assembly that every citizen has,” she said. “And I think this Pride season will be a stark reminder of that.” In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

    "title": "Arm prison officers against violent and terrorist inmates, says Tories’ Jenrick",
    "article_text": "TheConservativeshave called for some prison officers to have access to firearms to counter “out of control” Islamist gangs and violent prisoners. The shadow justice secretary,Robert Jenrick, said specialist teams should be armed with Tasers, stun grenades, and in some circumstances lethal weapons. He also called for high-collar stab vests to be provided to frontline officers right away, citing the threat from inmates after recent attacks on prison officers. “Islamist gangs and violent prisoners in our jails are out of control. It’s a national security emergency, but the government is dithering,” he said in the Telegraph. “If they don’t act soon, there is a very real risk that a prison officer is kidnapped or murdered in the line of duty, or that a terrorist attack is directed from inside prison.” Jenrick said he had commissioned Ian Acheson, a former prison governor, to carry out a rapid review. “We have to stop pussy-footing around Islamist extremists and violent offenders in jails,”Jenrick wrote. “That means arming specialist prison officer teams with Tasers and stun grenades, as well as giving them access to lethal weapons in exceptional circumstances. “If prison governors can’t easily keep terrorist influencers and radicalising inmates apart from the mainstream prisoners they target, then we don’t control our prisons – they do. We must take back control and restore order by giving officers the powers and protection they need.” It come after attacks by high-profile inmates. TheManchester Arena plotter Hashem Abeditargeted prison staff with boiling oil and homemade weapons in a planned ambush last month. The Southport killer Axel Rudakubana allegedly attacked a prison officer with boiling water at HMP Belmarsh this month. The justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has ordered a snap review into whether stab vests should be used more routinely, and a trial that will give specialised officers dealing with serious incidents Tasers is due to be launched in the summer. Officers already have access to batons and Pava spray, a synthetic form of pepper spray, in men’s prisons in the public sector. A Ministry of Justice source said the government has a “zero-tolerance approach” to violence and extremism in prisons. “The last government added just 500 cells to our prison estate, and left our jails in total crisis. In 14 years they closed 1,600 cells in the high-security estate, staff assaults soared, and experienced officers left in droves. Now the arsonists are pretending to be firefighters. “This government is cleaning up the mess the last government left behind. We are building new prisons, with 2,400 new cells opened since we took office. And we take a zero-tolerance approach to violence and extremism inside.”",

    "article_text": "A passenger train has derailed in Russia, killing at least seven people and injuring 30 others, after colliding with a bridge that collapsed because of what local officials described as “illegal interference”. The incident took place late on Saturday in Russia’s Bryansk region, which borders Ukraine. “Unfortunately, there are seven fatalities,” Bryansk Governor Alexander Bogomaz said in a post on Telegram. “Thirty victims, including two children, were taken to medical facilities in the Bryansk Region,” Bogomaz said, adding that two were in serious condition. The driver of the train was among those killed, according to Russian news agencies. Rosavtodor, Russia’s federal road transportation agency, said the destroyed bridge passed above the railway tracks where the train was travelling. The railway vehicle – which was going from the town of Klimov to the Russian capital, Moscow – veered off the tracks when it collided with the collapsed bridge near the village of Vygonichi, according to the RIA news agency. The area lies some 100km (62 miles) from Russia’s border with Ukraine. Rescuers were searching for passengers trapped inside the damaged train, while emergency accommodation was set up at a school in Vygonichi, RIA reported. Moscow Railway, in a post on Telegram, said the bridge had collapsed “as a result of an illegal interference in the operation of transport”. It did not elaborate further. Russia’s Baza Telegram channel, which often publishes information from sources in the security services and law enforcement, reported, without providing evidence, that according to preliminary information, the bridge was blown up. Explosions havederailed multiple trains, most of them freight trains, in Russian regions near Ukraine as fighting between Russia and Ukraine continues. There was no immediate comment from Ukraine. Two hours after the bridge collapse was reported, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said that Ukraine’s air defence units were trying to repel a Russian air attack on the Ukrainian capital. Earlier on Saturday, Russian drone and missile attacks killed at least two people in Ukraine,officials said. Since the start of Russia’s invasion three years ago, there have been continued cross-border shelling, drone strikes and covert raids from Ukraine into Russia’s Bryansk, Kursk and Belgorod regions, which border Ukraine. United States President Donald Trump has urged Moscow and Kyiv to work together on a deal to end the war, and Russia has proposed a second round of face-to-face talks with Ukrainian officials next week in Istanbul. Ukraine is yet to commit to attending the talks on Monday, saying it first needs to see Russian proposals, while a leading US senator warned Moscow it would be “hit hard” by new US sanctions.",

    "article_text": "Jared Isaacman’s nomination to lead NASA was reportedly pulled over previous political donations to Democrats. Jared Isaacman’s nomination to lead NASA was reportedly pulled over previous political donations to Democrats. byRichard Lawler Just one day after Elon Musk’spublic departure from his role as a White House employee, the Trump Administration pulled itsnomination of Musk ally Jared Isaacmanto become the new NASA Administrator. First reported earlier on Saturday bySemafor, citing anonymous sources, the move has been confirmed by White House spokesperson Liz Huston. TheNew York Timesreports, based on three unnamed sources, that Trump “told associates he intended to yank Mr. Isaacman’s nomination after learning that he had donated to prominent Democrats,” including Arizona Senator Mark Kelly. Isaacman, the billionaire founder and CEO of a payments company, Shift4, haspurchased several spaceflightsfrom Musk’s SpaceX. He flew on the Inspiration4 mission in 2021, and again last yearon Polaris Dawn, completing the first commercial spacewalk. As noted bySpace.com, the White House also released anin-depth version of its NASA budget requestfor 2026 on Friday, proposing to cut its funding by nearly one-quarter, from $24.8 billion to $18.8 billion, with funding for science programs dropping by 47 percent. In a statement released Friday,The Planetary Societycalled the budget justification “an extinction-level event for the space agency’s most productive, successful, and broadly supported activity: science,” that “wastes billions in prior taxpayer investment and slams the brakes on future exploration.” Now, without Isaacman in place,Ars Technicaquotes an unnamed former senior NASA leader who said the request is “just a going-out-of-business mode.” In a statement emailed to media outlets includingNBC, Huston wrote, “It’s essential that the next leader of NASA is in complete alignment with President Trump’s America First agenda and a replacement will be announced directly by President Trump soon.” Despite being unable to confirm to the Senate whether Musk had been a part of his job interview, he had appeared set for an approval vote to replace former Florida Senator Bill Nelson. According to theNYT, Isaacman was informed of the decision on Friday and declined to comment when reached by phone.

    "title": "Kansas woman convicted of double murder after three trials",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 31, 2025 / 11:04 PM EDT/ CBS News Dana Chandler has spent decades maintaining her innocence against allegations she was responsible for the 2002 murders of her ex-husband, Mike Sisco, and his girlfriend, Karen Harkness. In 2025, Chandler took on her own defense, representing herself in the third trial the state brought against her for the murders. DANA CHANDLER (in court, closing): My liberty, my freedom is hanging in the balance. Hailey Seel is Dana Chandler and Mike Sisco's daughter. She and other Sisco and Harkness family members have spent decades grieving, searching for answers and for justice.\"I want to understand what happened and why. And — and — and actually know the truth of what happened,\" she tells \"48 Hours\" contributor Jim Axelrod. \"48 Hours\" first started covering the murders in 2008 and spoke with individuals involved several times over the years. Hailey Seel: It's hard to swallow and it's hard to believe. It's insane. (crying) For Hailey, it all started on July 7, 2002. She learned her father and Harkness had been killed in Harkness' Topeka, Kansas, home. Hailey Seel: I immediately just saw a bunch of tape around the house and police. … And my grandma's sitting in there and she just told me that they had been shot. The night before the murders, Sisco and Harkness enjoyed an evening at a casino about an hour outside of Topeka. Surveillance footage shows them leaving about 1:30 a.m. They then stopped to get coffee – the last time video captured Harkness alive. Harold Worswick(2008): They were extremely happy, you could just see that. Harkness' father, Harold Worswick. Harold Worswick:Everything they did was for each other. The day after Sisco and Harkness' night out, a family get-together had been planned at Harkness' house. Relatives thought the couple might be announcing they were engaged. Harold Worswick: And I rang the doorbell and knocked on the glass and couldn't raise anybody. I thought, \"This is strange.\" Worswick, who has since died, recalled that he entered Harkness' home that afternoon through an open sliding door, didn't see any sign of Karen or Mike Sisco, so he headed downstairs to the bedroom. Harold Worswick: Just as I got to the foot of the stairs, I could see Karen. … And I said, \"Oh, Christ.\" I knew she was dead. And then I found Mike on the outside of the bed. Worswick would then call 911. HAROLD WORSWICK (to 911): I just located my daughter and she's downstairs and she's dead … Det. Richard Volle:I got a radio call just after two o'clock on July 7th, 2002. Richard Volle, now retired, was the Topeka Police Department's lead detective on the case. Det. Richard Volle:It was a report of two dead bodies in a basement. Five bullets had struck Harkness, 53, including in her back and buttocks. Sisco, 47, suffered between five and seven gunshot wounds. The couple had been in bed. The rest of the house appeared undisturbed. Investigators found more than $1,000 in cash, a Rolex watch and other jewelry left behind. Robbery was quickly ruled out. To understand who might want Harkness and Sisco dead, police turned to their families for information. Det. Richard Volle: What we're left with is an emotional killing. It's an emotional execution. Sisco, a salesperson for a welding company, and Harkness, who worked in the hospitality industry, were both previously married and now divorced. The well-liked couple had been dating about four years. Harkness' children, Chad and Erin, were in their 20s at the time of the murders. Chad Harkness:It was a surprise to everybody that this would happen to somebody like her. Erin Sutton:My mom was an amazing woman. … She, she didn't have enemies. … And I remember telling her on several occasions that if I could be half the mom that she was to me, then I would be the best mom in the world. Sisco had custody of his two children, Hailey, then, 17, and Dustin, 15. Dustin Sisco:My dad was really my life growing up … He was really my hero. Hailey's relationship with her dad was more complicated. Hailey Seel: I wasn't happy with my dad. I wasn't happy with my mom. I wasn't happy at my school. By Hailey's own admission, she was a difficult teen. Hailey Seel: My dad gave me an ultimatum: \"Either you follow my rules or you move out.\" She chose to live with her then-boyfriend, Chris. Hailey Seel: And I moved in with Chris and then my dad was killed. That defiance made Hailey and Chris of interest to police. They were polygraphed and questioned. DET. VOLLE: I'm just curious, is everything all right with your dad and everything? HAILEY SEEL: Uh, yeah. … We weren't really getting along for a little while. Authorities said their alibis checked out. As did the alibis of Harkness' daughter, Erin, and her husband, Jeff Sutton. Harkness' son Chad was also questioned. Chad Harkness: I was hooked up to a polygraph machine and asked if I had murdered my mother or in any way participated in the murder of my mother. Police concluded none of them were involved. But family members thought they knew who was responsible: Mike Sisco's ex-wife, Dana Chandler. Cathy Boots:She just — she never fit in. Cathy Boots, Mike Sisco's sister, watched Chandler and Sisco's relationship deteriorate. After 15 years of marriage, the couple went through a bitter divorce, finalized in 1998. Sisco's relatives say Chandler had a drinking problem and she sporadically stalked Sisco during and after the divorce, with frequent calls and bizarre visits. Cathy Boots: The kids were upstairs in their room. … And we heard a noise and there she was … in the middle of the night … jumping on a trampoline in the backyard of Mike's home. Mark Boots is Mike Sisco's brother-in-law. Mark Boots:  I think she became obsessed with the fact that Mike was moving on with his life. …  And then when Karen entered the picture, that's when things really started, I think, escalating. Mike Sisco kept track of some of the incidents from 1998 in a day planner, writing: JULY 28: … Dana stalking neighborhood at 8:30, caught her she left. ... NOVEMBER 12: Dana came in house while I was at Karens from 7:00 to 11:00 went thrus stuff … Mark Boots: She was willing to travel great distances to show up back in his life. According to the Boots, the last time Chandler showed up at Mike Sisco's home was in the spring of 2002, several months before the murders. Cathy Boots said Mike told her Chandler went there to talk about moving back in. Cathy Boots: She said, \"The kids are getting older. … They're having different issues with themselves now. They need both parents. I think I should move back in and we should parent together.\" Mark Boots: All this harassment and stalking had come to the point that Mike told me that he and Karen now feared for their lives. Mark Boots says Mike Sisco made that clear to him on a fishing trip, nine days before the murders. Mark Boots: He turned to me and said, \"Mark, you're gonna wake up and find me dead.  And I want you to know who did it, Dana Chandler.\" But Chandler lived eight hours away in Denver and there was no sign that she had been in Harkness' house in Topeka the night of the murders. Det. Richard Volle: The victims were doing absolutely nothing and may not have seen it coming at all. Investigators were trying to determine who would gun down Mike Sisco and Karen Harkness as they lay in bed. Detective Richard Volle called Sisco's ex-wife, Dana Chandler, to inform her of Mike's murder. DET. RICHARD VOLLE (phone call to Chandler): Your husband was found shot to death today, this afternoon. Your ex-husband, I'm sorry … Can you tell me when the last time was that you talked to him? Chandler, Volle says, did not ask many questions and did not seem concerned. Chandler would later say she was very upset on that call. But only Volle's side of their conversation was recorded, due to a technical error, he said, on his part. The next evening, Chandler called the Topeka Police Department, leaving a message on a different officer's voicemail: DANA CHANDLER (phone call to police): Hi, my name is Dana Chandler and I got a very disturbing phone call last night. Someone had said that my ex-husband had been killed, and I'm just calling to — to see if that's true or not … Chandler would later explain her call was simply seeking confirmation. Given the personal nature of the murders, no signs of a burglary, and those stories about a messy divorce and stalking, Chandler became the main suspect. Volle decided to talk with Chandler in person, recording this audio, four days after the murders: DET. RICHARD VOLLE ( interview audio 2002): Tell me about what happened on the 6th. DANA CHANDLER: I got up, I had my morning coffee. But again, there was an issue with the recording. In most of the rest of the conversation, Chandler is difficult to hear. Volle recounted what he said she told him. Det. Richard Volle: She said she'd been at home, Saturday morning, that's July 6th … and then made a couple of errand stops. Chandler said she bought cigarettes, snacks, and a car cigarette lighter at several stores around Denver and then got gas. But Volle says she failed to mention one purchase he saw on a credit card receipt. Det. Richard Volle: She'd bought two five-gallon gas cans, as well. Volle wondered why she didn't tell him and why she would even need gas cans, unless she had been planning a trip, perhaps to Kansas, and didn't want to stop for gas along the way. According to Volle, Chandler had also said, after running those errands, she went home to her Denver apartment. Det. Richard Volle: Didn't have any visitors. No contact with anybody. And the next day got up and went for a drive in the mountains at ten o'clock in the morning. But Volle couldn't verify that Chandler was in her apartment the night of the murders, nor that she took a drive in the mountains the next day. Volle said the area Chandler described driving through would have meant she'd have to pass Rocky Mountain National Park surveillance cameras. Those cameras were checked. Volle said there was no sign of her car. Det. Richard Volle: The particular person that I had view that tape looked at every frame slowly. … She was never there. Investigators also reviewed Chandler's cellphone records. They said that while she tended to use her cellphone frequently, she, oddly, had no activity around the time of the murders. Det. Richard Volle: What we found was there was a 27-hour window where her phone wasn't used. Still, there was no DNA, no fingerprints, or other forensic evidence to tie Chandler to the killings. The gun used in the murders hadn't been found, though investigators learned the bullets were from an Israeli weapons manufacturer. And Chandler would go on to say she didn't even own a gun. But family members remained convinced that Chandler was responsible for the murders. They say they pushed to have a meeting with then-DA Robert Hecht. Tim Sisco is Mike Sisco's brother. Tim Sisco: I specifically went into this meeting wanting to know if he would pursue a circumstantial case. … And the answer was, \"Without that murder weapon, we don't have enough hard evidence to move this forward.\" The Sisco and Harkness families grew increasingly frustrated and decided to take action — looking for more information about Chandler's possible involvement in the murders. Cathy Boots: I put her picture up everywhere. \"Have you seen this person?\" Several months after the murders, having more questions than answers, Mike Sisco's sister Cathy Boots said she and their mom Carol Sisco went searching for clues, even lifting up manhole covers and looking in rest stop bathrooms for the gun used in the murders. Cathy Boots: We thought, you know, maybe she threw the gun somewhere. … So I would stand on a toilet and try and push a tile up. They found nothing, but Hailey Seel, Chandler, and Mike Sisco's daughter, was also working the case. Hailey Seel:I felt the need to do something. I didn't wanna just sit back with my hands tied and helpless. In 2005, three years after the murders, Hailey began secretly recording conversations with her mother, trying to learn what happened to her dad and Harkness. HAILEY SEEL (recorded phone call): … I think that the only way I can really move on with a relationship with you is if we can get it, you know, if you can just tell me yourself that you did it. … DANA CHANDLER: Well, number one, I didn't do it and number one I, number two, I don't know what happened Hailey. … One thing Hailey asked about was why her mother had no cellphone activity for 27 hours around the time of the murders. HAILEY SEEL (recorded phone call): Why did it have no calls and was at home the whole time? You knew it could be traced. DANA CHANDLER: I was in the mountains; I didn't have a signal. Chandler insisted she had nothing to do with the murders, but did say she had violent thoughts about Mike Sisco. DANA CHANDLER (recorded conversation): I said I could kill him. You ever think about killing him? HAILEY SEEL No, but — DANA CHANDLER: I did. HAILEY SEEL: But — DANA CHANDLER: Honestly, I can say I did. The official investigation, though, seemed stalled, so authorities asked Vernon Geberth, a homicide and forensic consultant and former New York City Police Department detective, to review case files. In 2007, nearly five years after the murders, he issued a report concluding \"… Dana Chandler is the one and only person who had the motive, means and opportunity to commit these murders.\" It was Geberth who brought the case to the attention of \"48 Hours.\" In 2009, \"48 Hours\" aired its first report on the murders —and tried to talk with Chandler. HAROLD DOW | \"48 Hours\" correspondent: Did you know anything about the death of Michael and Karen? DANA CHANDLER: I have no idea what happened to Mike and Karen. \"48 Hours\" ended the episode asking viewers to contact police if they had any information. Again, the case seemed to be going nowhere. But two years later, a new DA, Chad Taylor, decided he was willing to take a chance with the evidence they had. He chose to move the case forward and arrest Chandler. With \"48 Hours\" cameras rolling, law enforcement, zeroed in on Chandler in Oklahoma, where she was staying at the time. Taylor didn't just help plan the arrest, but went on it, with a gun at the ready. And on July 24, 2011, Chandler was in custody, charged with the murders of Mike Sisco and Karen Harkness. Hailey SeelI'd hit a point where I didn't know … if justice would ever … be served. For Hailey Seel who was convinced her mother killed her father, Dana Chandler's arrest was nearly a decade in the making. Hailey SeelIt was such a feeling that I – I — it was unbelievable. She was determined to get justice as she prepared to face Dana Chandler in court. Hailey Seel: I've made it this far. … I can do anything. In March 2012, Chandler went on trial. Jacqie Spradling, then-chief deputy DA, began by referring to those conversations Hailey Seel had taped years earlier with her mother. JACQIE SPRADLING (in court): \"I could kill him. I thought about killing him.\" These are the words of this defendant about her ex-husband Mike Sisco. In her opening statement, Spradling suggested a possible motive for murder. JACQIE SPRADLING (in court) Two days before the homicides, the defendant called Mike. Mike at this time told the defendant, in that five-minute phone call, that he and Karen were going to be married. But there is no recording of that call. MARK BENNETT (in court) It's easy to make allegations. It's difficult to prove those allegations. And in his opening, defense attorney Mark Bennett argued the case against Chandler was all speculation. MARK BENNETT (in court): There is no evidence that places Dana Chandler in or near the Harkness residence on July 6th or 7th, 2002. But to authorities, there was the question about exactly where Chandler was during that time. Volle says she told him she was home Saturday, the night of the murders and then drove through the mountains the next day. But Chandler's business acquaintance Jeff Bailey, testified Chandler told him something different — that she slept in her car in the mountains the Saturday night of the murders. JEFF BAILEY (in court): She told me that the story she was giving me was the truth. And the story that she'd given to the law enforcements was not the truth. And prosecutors told the jury Chandler did not use her cellphone for 27 hours the weekend of the murders. Remember, Hailey Seel accused her mother of trying to avoid being tracked. Volle found another instance when Chandler didn't use her phone a month before the murders. DET. RICHARD VOLLE (in court): There were no calls registered. There were some calls came to the phone, but none were picked up.And prosecutors say that's important, because during that time — a month before the murders — was Chandler's dry run for the killings. They called her friend Ann Carrender to the stand. Carrender says Dana told her she had driven to Topeka. ANN CARRENDER (in court): She had— gone to Mike's house— through the window. Um, nobody was home. … JACQIE SPRADLING: What else did she tell you? ANN CARRENDER: That she had gone — and sat outside Karen's house. Spradling says Chandler was obsessed with Mike Sisco and presented evidence that in the six months leading up to the murders, she called Mike Sisco and Karen Harkness more than 600 times. The defense argued Chandler was calling to talk to her kids, but Hailey Seel remembered her mother's calls differently. JACQIE SPRADLING (in court): What was the thing that she talked to you the most about? HAILEY SEEL:  She talked about my dad a lot. And – I — I re — I really feel like she was — was really just obsessed — with him. An FBI analyst testified Chandler often called late at night, and frequently made repeated calls in a short time period, including a month before the murders. ALICE CASEY (in court): On June 3rd, she made 17 calls in 18 minutes. Both of Chandler's children testified for the prosecution, saying that their mother also had a history of stalking their father. DUSTIN SISCO (in court): She took me and my sister with her to go spy on my dad. … And so we were in the car and she told us, you know, we're just going to be her little helpers. HAILEY SEEL (in court): She asked if I would go — go up to the house with her. And we did. And she was looking in all the windows. And she told me to look in the windows. And – JACQIE SPRADLING: Did you? HAILEY SISCO: I did. … JACQIE SPRADLING: What was it that she was looking at in there? HAILEY SEEL: I think that she — was — was thinking there was — a lady in there with my dad. Hailey also testified about those recordings she made talking with her mother. During one of them, Chandler, who attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, gave an explanation as to why she bought those gas cans. DANA CHANDLER (audio recording): I ran into a girl that had run out of gas at an AA meeting and so I went and got gas for her. She asked me for money and we don't give people money at AA … Prosecutor Spradling told the jury that she believed Chandler used those two five-gallon gas cans to have enough gas so she would not have to stop and potentially be seen near the crime scene. But Chandler's attorney argued there was no proof she was ever in Topeka during the time of the murders. MARK BENNETT (in court): Did you or … any other members of the Topeka Police Department … ever find an eyewitness that put — the defendant, Dana Chandler, in Topeka, Kansas on either July 6 or July 7, 2002? DET. RICHARD VOLLE: No. The closest law enforcement was able to come was at a gas station in WaKeeney, Kansas, nearly halfway between Denver and Topeka.ClerkPatty Williams wasn't sure, but she thought she might have seen Chandler the night of the murders. Jacqie Spradling: Patty was shown a picture of the defendant … Patty indicated that she was 70 percent sure that that was the woman who had been there. But by the time Chandler went on trial, Patty Williams had died. A different worker from the gas station testified about seeing a black car that looked similar to the one Chandler drove that day. But she said it might have had license plates from Virginia. When it was the defense's turn, Bennett pointed out there was no proof Chandler was ever there. MARK BENNETT (in court): Wasn't any receipt from WaKeeney, was there? DET. RICHARD VOLLE: No. And Bennett questioned whether Volle investigated other suspects, like two men with criminal records who had stolen checks from Mike Sisco and cashed one after the murders. MARK BENNETT (in court): That didn't make 'em a suspect? DET. RICHARD VOLLE: No, because the check wasn't taken from Karen Harkness' house where the murders occurred. The check was actually taken from Mike Sisco's house where the murders did not occur. And one of the men was in jail when the murders occurred. In closing arguments, Bennett reiterated there was no forensic evidence linking Chandler to the crime. MARK BENNETT (in court): All this time, they've been trying to put her in Kansas when this happened. And for nine-and-a-half years, they've come up dry. Spradling reminded the jury of Chandler's stalking behavior— and tried to make sure they knew just how scared Mike Sisco was of Chandler. She said Mike Sisco had gotten a protection from abuse order against Chandler. JACQIE SPRADLING (in court):So, he got a court order saying she has to stay away. The protection from abuse order did not stop the defendant, though. After two weeks of testimony, it took the jury 83 minutes to reach a verdict: guilty of first-degree murder. Hailey Seel: I feel better in the sense that my dad's killer is paying for their actions … I don't feel better that my mom is capable of killing my dad. When it was time for sentencing, Hailey Seel asked that her mom receive the maximum sentence. HAILEY SEEL (in court:) We each have a deep scar on our souls from what this monster has done. But Chandler would also get a chance to speak.DANA CHANDLER (in court): But most importantly, I deny that I murdered Mike or Karen. I am innocent. I did not murder Mike or Karen. Chandler was sentenced to life in prison. But soon that verdict would be called into question. Hailey Seel:A lot of my mind has been focused on her getting away with killing my Dad, and … just drags me down. For years, Hailey Seel's thoughts were consumed with proving her mother killed her father, Mike Sisco, and Karen Harkness. With Dana Chandler in prison, Hailey was relieved she could concentrate on other things. But her relief was tinged with pain. Hailey Seel:I wanna focus on my future and what I want to do with my life. … I wanna be everything my mom wasn't. (cries) But Hailey's focus would turn again to the case. Chandler almost immediately began filing motions as she worked to appeal her conviction. She and her attorneys cited, among other things, the actions of prosecutor Jacqie Spradling. In particular, statements Spradling made at trial about that protection from abuse order. JACQIE SPRADLING (in court): Mike got a protection from abuse, a court order. He applied and said, \"Hey, judge, please order this woman to stay away from me.\" And the judge agreed. Stacey Schlimmer: And that is just a blatant misstatement. Stacey Schlimmer, one of Chandler's appeal attorneys, was never able to find a protection from abuse order. Stacey Schlimmer: I went through the whole case. I went and looked for every possible order I could find. And there wasn't one that she was referring to. In 2018, Schlimmer argued that Spradling's actions constituted prosecutorial misconduct. STACEY SCHLIMMER (arguing before Kansas Supreme Court): I — I think that Ms. Chandler never had an opportunity at a fair trial from the get-go. Schlimmer contended the case against Chandler should be thrown out. The court agreed. Stacey Schlimmer: The Kansas Supreme Court held that … it's so bad that we're going to go ahead and overturn her conviction. Other issues about statements Spradling made at trial also came up, including describing a route Chandler took between Kansas and Denver when there was no evidence that she drove that way. JACQIE SPRADLING (in court): She drove directly up to Nebraska. And after she gets on Nebraska she turns around and goes home. Stacey Schlimmer: They just kinda hypothesized, \"Well, she must have went up and went over from Nebraska.\" There was no evidence of that at all. Schlimmer also contended the state did not have enough evidence to prove Dana Chandler's guilt. Stacey Schlimmer: We argued insufficiency of evidence as an issue for appeal … Jim Axelrod: Meaning you don't think prosecutors had enough to make a legitimate case? Stacey Schlimmer: Jurors didn't have enough evidence before them if you took out all the evidence that should've never been presented or told to them incorrectly. The Kansas Supreme Court described Spradling's actions as, \"intolerable acts of deception.\" Andshe was disbarred. \"48 Hours\" reached out to Spradling, but did not receive a response. Stacey Schlimmer: When a case gets reversed, like a case like this, we essentially have an innocent woman who's been convicted of crime because of the prosecutor. Or we have a family that has now a reversed conviction that has to go through the system again. Jim Axelrod: Either way, there's an injustice. Stacey Schlimmer: Right. So … that conduct is gonna affect someone. The Kansas Supreme Court did decide, though, there was sufficient evidence to retry Chandler if the district attorney chose to. Hailey Seel:When I found out that the Kansas Supreme Court overturned the verdict … it was very shocking. … What does this mean? Will the DA's office retry her? … Jim Axelrod: Were you angry with the prosecutor who was cited for misconduct? Hailey Seel: I've never been angry with her. … I think it was an innocent mistake. Chad Harkness, Karen Harkness' son, takes a different view of Spradling's actions. Chad Harkness: Had Jacqie not made those comments, we wouldn't be sitting here today. This — this would be over. … Now … all these years later, we're still having to, you know, live through this again. And it — it's just — it's not right. It's not fair. The decision whether to retry Chandler was now in the hands of Shawnee County's new DA, Mike Kagay. Mike Kagay:We analyzed every aspect of the case. And ultimately, we came to the conclusion that we believed justice demanded that we move forward, and we pursue another trial. Pursuing that would take years. Chandler remained incarcerated. She, and her defense lawyers, argued she should be set free, and fought against having another trial. Jim Axelrod: What were those years like? Hailey Seel: Unbelievable. For Hailey, the delays seemed endless. Chandler and her lawyers filed nearly 400 motions, including ones requesting a change of judge, to retain an investigator, for her bond to be reduced, and to disqualify the Shawnee County District Attorney's Office. And through it all, she fired several of her lawyers. Hailey Seel: She went through seven lawyers in that time, uh, between representing herself. There were also dozens of hearings, including one where Hailey was called to testify – and Chandler did the questioning. Hailey Seel: She took me on the stand for at least 45 minutes … and she directly questioned me. Jim Axelrod: What was that like? Hailey Seel: It was the most awful thing I've ever … I mean, the — the suspect in the killing of my dad is now having the power to question me on the stand and talk to me. … Jim Axelrod: Not just the suspect in the killing of your dad, your own mother. Hailey Seel: Yeah, yeah. I mean, It – it — it was awful. But Hailey was willing to take whatever steps necessary to ensure her mother would stand trial again for the murders. Hailey Seel: If she could bring out something to prove where she was, to say she didn't do it, prove she didn't do it — that's not just for me, that's for her and her own freedom. But she can't, and she hasn't. Mike Kagay: Two innocent people were murdered in our community. That demands justice. Although Dana Chandler's conviction had been overturned, prosecutors were determined to retry her for the murders of Mike Sisco and Karen Harkness. By 2021, the organization,Miracle of Innocence, got involved, advocating for Chandler. Darryl Burton: Dana Chandler was someone who, we believed in her innocence. … When we looked at the case, the facts was just … nothing connected this lady to the crime. Darryl Burton is the co-founder of Miracle of Innocence. He's someone who was wrongfully imprisoned and had his murder conviction reversed. He says, before sending someone to prison, the case needs to be more convincing than the one made against Chandler. Darryl Burton: There's no evidence … no fingerprints, no DNA, no confession, no weapon, no witnesses, nothing. … When it comes to, you know, these kinds of crimes of murder, you just got to have more than that. Chandler and her attorneys also raised other issues as they tried to get the case dismissed. Some allegations related to the 2009 \"48 Hours\" broadcast. Chandler falsely accused law enforcement of forming \"a partnership with '48 Hours' to film an episode aimed at convincing the public that Ms. Chandler murdered Mike Sisco and Karen Harkness.\" Jim Axelrod: What do you make of the idea that, if \"48 Hours\" had not reported, starting in 2009, on this case, that Dana Chandler would never have been arrested or tried? Stacey Schlimmer: I don't think it was \"48 Hours\" (laughs). 2009 is a lot different than when they arrested her. They arrested her three or four years — three years later.I think the family was what kept it going. They believe that Ms. Chandler did this. … It was the new prosecutor, and it was the family probably saying, \"Hey, we need justice done in this.\" But Stacey Schlimmer, Chandler's former appeal attorney, does take issue with the handling of the 2011 arrest and the show of force. Jim Axelrod: You've seen Dana Chandler's arrest many times. Stacey Schlimmer: Right. Jim Axelrod: And it bothers you. Stacey Schlimmer: It bothers me a lot. \"48 Hours,\" as well as The Topeka Capital-Journal, were given advance notice of the arrest by the office of then-DA Chad Taylor. Jim Axelrod: Are you bothered by law enforcement …  or are you bothered by the fact that there were cameras there? Stacey Schlimmer: I'm bothered by the prosecutor. I'm bothered by the district attorney showing up at an arrest and having that arrest filmed. … Jim Axelrod: So they wanted video of law enforcement with their guns out? Stacey Schlimmer: I think they wanted then the public to see that. … That to me was it seemed like such a production for a case. … that prosecutor should never have done that. Ultimately, the various arguments Dana Chandler's team made to dismiss the case were unsuccessful. Chandler's new trial was scheduled for the summer of 2022. Before the trial began, \"48 Hours\" again tried to speak with Chandler. She said she would only agree to an interview if CBS paid her million-dollar bond. We declined. Chad Harkness: Never thought we'd be sitting here again and getting ready to start a — a retrial on this … it's just mind blowing. Chad Harkness, Karen Harkness' son, was relieved the DA's office decided to retry Chandler, but was concerned about going through this yet another time. Chad Harkness: Just — us kids having to relive this again and … It just it makes me sick. Hailey, too, was not looking forward to another trial. But said testifying again could give her some control of the situation. Hailey Seel:  If I can … realize my power. … And it gives me courage to go forward because I know the truth … The truth is that … she murdered them. The passage of time has left Hailey with so much loss — loss she holds her mother responsible for. And, as a mom herself, having married her high school boyfriend Chris Seel, Hailey's feelings are even more complicated. Jim Axelrod: When you think of your mom, do you think mother, or do you think Dana? Hailey Seel: I think Dana, yeah. She's Dana to me. Actually, mom is — is a — an ucky word to me, to the point where I don't even like my kids to call me mom. I don't like mom. Mom is a — a very hurtful person (cries). No matter the name, Dana Chandler is someone her daughter will have to face again in court — and  someone who will eventually tell her side of the story. DANA CHANDLER (in court): Let's start by stating my name.My name is Dana Chandler. I as everyone know, have been accused of double homicide and I am innocent. In the summer of 2022, Dana Chandler was on trial for the second time for the murders of Mike Sisco and Karen Harkness. As in her first trial, the defense focused on all that was lacking in the case against Chandler. TOM BATH (in court): There is no evidence that she was in the Harkness residence, no evidence she was in Topeka. There's no evidence she was in the state of Kansas. Defense attorney Tom Bath insisted Chandler was in Colorado at the time of the murders, more than 500 miles away, and faulted investigators for zeroing in on her. TOM BATH (in court): Everything they looked at, everything they examined … excluded Dana. The lack of physical evidence was acknowledged by Shawnee County Deputy District Attorney Charles Kitt. CHARLES KITT (in court): Science is not going to solve this case. This case is not based on DNA. Instead, the state focused on evidence such as Chandler's hatred of her ex-husband and his girlfriend. CHARLES KITT (in court): This case is based on jealousy, rage and obsession. Prosecutors presented evidence they say showed that obsession—including records of more than 600 phone calls Chandler made to Harkness and Sisco in the six months before the murders. And they introduced witnesses who said Harkness and Sisco told them some of those calls were menacing. Kim Warrender was Harkness' coworker. KIM WARRENDER (in court): She said she had been up all-night receiving phone calls from Dana. … CHARLES KITT: She told you she was afraid? KIM WARRENDER: Very afraid. Erin Sutton also testified that her mother, Karen Harkness, was scared of Chandler. She spoke about messages she said she heard that Chandler left on her mother's phone. ERIN SUTTON (in court): She would call my mom horrible names. CHARLES KITT: And, like, what kind of names would she call her? ERIN SUTTON: She would call her a whore. In addition to testimony about calls Chandler made, there was also attention paid to when there was no call activity on her phone– specifically during 27 hours the weekend of the murders. Authorities believed Chandler's phone was turned off so it could not be traced as she traveled to Kansas. But the defense suggested it could have just been spotty cellphone service in Colorado. Prosecutors told the jury about a purchase Chandler made the day before the murders but failed to mention to investigators. Kitt asked Richard Volle, the lead detective on the case, about the purchase. CHARLES KITT (in court): Can you tell us what that is? DET. RICHARD VOLLE (holding the receipt): This is an Auto Zone receipt … It shows the purch — first two purchases were five dollar or five-gallon gas cans. Authorities wondered why Chandler didn't tell them about the gas cans, and why she would need gas cans unless she was planning a trip — perhaps to Kansas — and did not want to stop for gas along the way. And there was the issue of Chandler's alibi — according to Detective Volle, a changing, unconfirmable one. One witness testified that Chandler said she was in the mountains in Colorado at the time of the murders, but Volle testified Chandler told him she was at home in her Denver apartment. DET. RICHARD VOLLE (in court): She said she'd stayed at her house, had no guests or phone calls and then she turned in about 9'o clock. A friend of Chandler's testified about something authorities thought might have been a dry run for the murders. She said about a month before the killings, Chandler called and told her about a trip she made to Sisco's and Harkness's homes . ANN HAMMER (in court): She told me that she knew nobody was in the house and that she went into Mike's home through the window. After that, she did go to, um, his girlfriend's house and sat outside her house, waiting for them to come home. But they didn't show up … CHARLES KITT: Did she tell you what she did when she — got into Mike's house? ANN HAMMER: She wanted to see what it looked like on the inside. But Chandler's attorney questioned the reliability of her testimony, pointing out she may have gotten some dates wrong regarding calls with Chandler. ANN HAMMER (in court): It must not have been a Monday. TOM BATH: But 20 years ago, you said it was a Monday. Right? ANN HAMMER: Sure. Testimony about Chandler's behavior also came from Cathy Boots, Mike Sisco's sister. She described an incident several years before the murders, that she said she witnessed while staying at Mike's house. CATHY BOOTS (in court): We went to bed that night and I woke up in the early morning hours … to a noise out in the backyard. And we had left the back porch lights on. And I looked out through the blinds and Dana was jumping on the trampoline out back. And Mike Sisco's brother-in-law, Mark Boots, recounted a disturbing conversation he said he had with Mike nine days before the murders. MARK BOOTS (in court): Mike told me that the patterns of harassment had increased and that he feared for he and Karen's lives. Mike Sisco and Dana Chandler's daughter, Hailey Seel, was going to be in the uncomfortable position of testifying against her mother. Hailey Seel: I was absolutely still nervous — and scared. …  Being up there, it causes conflict. As Hailey Seel reflected back on testifying against her mother, Dana Chandler, she recalled the stress she was under. As a prosecution witness, Seel was asked to describe some of her mother's behavior—behavior Seel said she found obsessive. CHARLES KITT (in court): Was there a time where you were asked to spy on your dad? HAILEY SEEL: Yeah. Seel recounted an incident, after her parents split up, when she said, Chandler drove her and her brother to Sisco's home, and they all sat in the car to watch the house. HAILEY SEEL (in court): She said, \"Come on. We need to watch your dad. And you can be my little helpers.\" … She had me go with her to the house after so long. And — um, and she wanted to look in the windows. CHARLES KITT: Did she look in the windows? HAILEY SEEL: Yeah. We both looked in the windows. And she said, \"Did you see that? Did you see that?\" And I said, \"No. I didn't see anything.\" It was episodes like that which led Seel, early on, to think her mother could be responsible for the murders. Hailey Seel: I always suspected she had something to do with it because of the history of her harassment, stalking, hatred, talking bad about them to us all the time. Seel testified about some of the ways her mother expressed that dislike of her father — like the demeaning ways Chandler referred to him in emails and online chats — including ones where Chandler referred to Sisco as \"it\" — sent when Seel was 14 years old. CHARLES KITT (in court, pointing at email): And does she call him manipulative and deceiving? HAILEY SEEL:  Yes. CHARLES KITT: And then calls him a rapist. HAILEY SEEL: Yeah. … CHARLES KITT And just a couple of lines down, \"I hate his guts.\" HAILEY SEEL: Yeah. CHARLES KITT: Are those things your mother typed to you? HAILEY SEEL: Yes. HAILEY SEEL (recording to Dana Chandler): Nobody can say that they — that you were in Colorado that weekend? Also played in court, were those conservations Hailey secretly recorded with her mom as she tried to learn more about Chandler's possible involvement in the murders. Jim Axelrod:  In all the conversations you had with her over the days, weeks, months, even years after this happened, she never told you something … that made you think, well, at least my mom didn't do it? Hailey Seel: No. Every time I talked to her, I felt more and more confident that she definitely had something to do with it. And perhaps most telling to Hailey was a conversation, played in court, where Chandler said she had thought about killing Mike Sisco. DANA CHANDLER (recording): …. you ever think about killing him? HAILEY SEEL: No, but — DANA CHANDLER: I did. In one of those discussions, Hailey asked her mother about why she bought those two gas cans — which authorities thought could have been used to help drive roundtrip from Denver to Topeka without stopping in Kansas for fuel. Chandler, who'd been a problem drinker, explained she bought them for someone else—a woman she met at AA. DANA CHANDLER (recording, played in court): … She asked me for money and we don't give people money at AA. I said, \"I'll go buy you some gas …\" The prosecutor asked Hailey if she was able to learn anything more about that woman from Chandler. CHARLES KITT (in court): She wouldn't tell you who that person was? HAILEY SEEL: No. She didn't. But Chandler's defense team argued those recorded conversations proved nothing about the murders. And regarding the two gas cans, it maintained that the 10 extra gallons the cans could hold would not have been enough for Chandler to drive roundtrip from Denver to Topeka without still needing to stop for fuel. The defense accused authorities of tunnel vision — including not looking more thoroughly at other suspects. And her lawyers said Chandler never owned a .9mm gun — the type of weapon used in the murders, which was never found. What was found, were unusual bullets made in Israel. AMY COODY (in court): Israel Military Industries, that's the manufacturer. Chandler's attorney questioned a firearms examiner who had worked for the Kansas Bureau of Investigation about those bullets. TOM BATH (in court): Is that a bullet, ammunition you typically see? AMY COODY: Actually, we had not seen that before. And so it was a little bit unusual to us. The prosecution, though, explained there were places one could buy those bullets. CHARLES KITT (in court): Could that ammo have been brought into Kansas and sold at a gun show? AMY COODY: Yes, sir. CHARLES KITT: Could have been exchanged by individuals? AMY COODY: Yes, sir. There were other parts of the investigation that the defense argued supported its case. There was forensic work it said eliminated Chandler. Unidentified fingerprints found at the house did not match Chandler. None of Chandler's DNA was found at the murder scene, nor were any fibers found from her clothing, or any of her hair. KAREN THIESSEN (in court): I did not find any … hairs that were consistent with the sample coming from Ms. Chandler. TOM BATH (in court): In 20 years, the state had no evidence, no evidence whatsoever that placed Dana Chandler in Karen Harkness' home, in the city of Topeka, or in the state of Kansas. After three weeks of testimony, that lack of physical evidence would be the defense's theme in its closing argument. TOM BATH (in court): Each and every time they tested something, it excluded Dana. CHARLES KITT (in court): From the beginning, I told you this case is about obsession, jealousy, rage. The state focused on Chandler's behavior — her calls, emails, and her own family's testimony against her. CHARLES KITT (in court): The defendant clearly hated Karen and Mike, words from her own mouth and her own fingers typing those messages. TOM BATH (in court): A lot of evidence about Dana's bad behavior. That's true. … That's not evidence. …  They have not proven this case beyond a reasonable doubt. On Aug. 25, 2022, the case went to the jury, and Hailey was waiting for a verdict. Hailey Seel: I've really tried to trust the process … cause I knew I didn't have any control over it. So it was gonna be what it was gonna be. But the wait to find out what that verdict would be was a long one. The case in the second trial of Dana Chandler for the murders of Mike Sisco and Karen Harkness went to the jury on Aug. 25, 2022. That day came and went, as did several more. Hailey Seel: After about four days ... I started to get nervous and think, wow, this actually could not come back in a guilty verdict and I started to think of that possibility. … And so … I prayed and I just trusted that, if she did get away with this that … life would have to go on, right? After six days of deliberating, Chandler would learn her fate. JUDGE CHERYL RIOS (in court): I understand that the jury is unable to reach a unanimous verdict at this time, is that correct? FOREPERSON: That's correct. The jury informed the judgethey were deadlocked. There were seven votes to convict and five to acquit. Ben Alford: We did what we could with what we had. Ben Alford and Carrie Kimes were two members of the jury who voted to find Chandler not guilty. Carrie Kimes:I never saw actual evidence that — Dana Chandler was ever in the Harkness home. …  I can't send somebody to spend the rest of their life in prison if you can't even prove she left Colorado that weekend. Ben Alford: Everything that was tested for DNA proved inconclusive. … And that's pretty remarkable. But for juror Randy Edwards, the state's depiction of Chandler's behavior was persuasive evidence. Randy Edwards: She was beyond upset. She was obsessed. He also found those conversations Seel recorded with her mother to be convincing and voted to convict. Randy Edwards: When I was able to comprehend that Dana said that she had thought of killing Mike, that was probably the — the piece that pushed me beyond any question of reasonable doubt anymore. Mike Kagay: There was a split verdict, but the majority of the jury was in favor of a conviction and that was meaningful. DA Mike Kagay decided to retry Dana Chandler. Her lawyers convinced the court to reduce her bond, which allowed her to be released with supervision as she awaited the next trial. JUDGE CHERYL RIOS (in court): The court is going to direct that … she have GPS monitoring. After spending more than a decade incarcerated,Chandler celebrated her freedomwith Darryl Burton and Miracle of Innocence. Darryl Burton: Anybody who's getting outta prison after you've been in prison for any length of time, it is, it's a joyous occasion. … You're happy that someone's been released and, you know, also feel like, well, maybe it's a good chance that, you know, we can, you know, mount a defense, and get her totally acquitted. As a condition of her release, Chandler was not allowed to contact her children. Still, Hailey worried about her safety. She is married to Chris Seel, her high school boyfriend, and is a mother of three. Hailey Seel: I'm scared to death that she's going to hurt me, or she's going to affect my kids in some way. Hailey's fear only grew when Chandler made a post to her Facebook page. Chandler complained about her treatment at trial, calling it a kangaroo court. And in the background, she showed images of Hailey's children. Hailey says Chandler somehow learned which church she attended and downloaded a livestream of a service to create the photos. Hailey Seel: It was chilling and it was disturbing. … I feel like it was a direct message to me. Jim Axelrod: And what was the message? Hailey Seel: Intimidation. … I don't care about your boundaries. Her belief that her mother committed the murders remains unwavering, and she says, disturbing. Hailey Seel:She's my mom but … if you're my mom, why would you do that to my dad? … For your kids' sake, maybe that would be a reason not to do it. … Being a mother now, I have a new perspective. … It becomes even more unreal now. Also unreal to Hailey — thoughts of a third trial. Jim Axelrod: What are your expectations for yet again another trial Hailey Seel: This time, I am not as confident. For trial number three, jurors would be from Pottawatomie County, Kansas. The defense requested a change of venue, and the judge agreed, citing excessive media coverage. It would take place in Westmoreland, a smaller, more rural area, 60 miles away from the last setting in Topeka. CHARLES KITT (in court): July 7th, 2002 was going to be a good day. Mike Sisco and Karen Harkness had been in a relationship for a few years. The trial got underway with opening statements on Feb. 7, 2025. CHARLES KITT (in court): One name just kept coming up, Dana Chandler. Charles Kitt was back retrying the case, joined by prosecutor Dan Dunbar. Judge Cheryl Rios again presided. And in a last-minute change, on the morning of opening statements, Chandler dismissed her defense attorneys. And Chandler decided the best person to represent her was herself. DANA CHANDLER (In court): I am innocent. I did not kill Mike and Karen. DANA CHANDLER (in court): I think this case is a character assassination. In February 2025, Dana Chandler was on trial for the third time for the murders of Mike Sisco and Karen Harkness. But this time, she was representing herself. Mike Kagay: She was exercising her constitutional right. … It was an unknown. It was certainly unexpected. One thing that was the same as in the previous trials: Hailey Seel testifying. Hailey was asked again by the prosecution about her mother's inappropriate behavior. DAN DUNBAR (in court): What sort of things would she say about Karen? HAILEY SEEL: She called her a homewrecker. Um, a slut, very bad names. Prosecutors were also interested in an incident when Chandler drove Hailey and her brother to drop them off at Harkness' house. HAILEY SEEL (in court): We waited there for a really long time in the car… And then my dad and Karen got there, and my mom got out and yelled at them and just was very angry with my dad. … DAN DUNBAR: Hailey, I don't have any further questions, thank you. When it was time to be cross-examined, Hailey knew it would now be her mother doing the questioning. Nt sd Dana \" Hello Ms. Seel.\" Hailey Seel: I really went up there — with like my game face on, you know. I — I knew it was war. I knew it wasn't going to be a — a nice, a cordial, a thoughtful — you're the victim, this was your dad and I'm so sorry place that she'd be coming from. Chandler challenged Hailey about her description of that drop-off at Harkness' home. Chandler said it was Hailey's father, Mike Sisco, who was behaving badly, not her. DANA CHANDLER (in court): When your dad and Karen drove up, your dad stormed over to the car. HAILEY SEEL: Oh, no. No, he did not. DANA CHANDLER: And he started banging on the window. HAILEY SEEL: Wha? No. No, he did not. I was inside that car and my dad absolutely did not bang on the windows. DANA CHANDLER: And I didn't get out — I never got out of the car. HAILEY SEEL: You were the first one out of the car. Hailey Seel: I was just in disbelief because I knew she just made that up because it never happened, and he never did that. … But … I didn't get concerned. I just said \"no, you know. I'm glad you asked so I can straighten this out. That never happened.\" And then it comes down to who's believable. And I wasn't worried about that. As another way to seemingly explain some of her past behaviors, Chandler brought up that she used to have a drinking problem. DANA CHANDLER (in court): And I did tell you that I was — I realized that I had a problem with alcohol. HAILEY SEEL: You did tell me you had a problem with alcohol. Something Chandler said she stopped by 1999, three years before the murders. DANA CHANDLER (in court): I told you I was going to three AA meetings a day, trying to get well. True? HAILEY SEEL: I knew you were trying to get well, yes. The state questioned though, if becoming sober changed Chandler's behavior. DAN DUNBAR (in court): When she came back clean and sober, did that change how she treated you? HAILEY SEEL: No. DAN DUNBAR: Did it — did it change how she talked about your dad? HAILEY SEEL: No. DAN DUNBAR: Did it change how she talked about Karen? HAILEY SEEL: No. Chandler not only thought she was the best person to represent herself, but when it was time to put on her defense, she decided she would be her own main witness. DANA CHANDLER (in court): I feel like that I need to kind of tell my story to kind of put things in perspective. She testified over seven days, speaking for about 20 hours. DANA CHANDLER (in court): You have not seen evidence that I was in Topeka, Kansas, on July 7th, 2002. Darryl Burton: There was times when she would take so long to try to get her point across. Dana Chandler's supporter, Darryl Burton, was concerned when she put herself on the stand. Darry Burton: Sometimes it seemed as though she was just rambling, you know, and that was just unfortunate.…She may have known — probably knew where she was trying to go, but she'd get lost. She again addressed issues such as her drinking and inappropriate conversations with Hailey. DANA CHANDLER (in court): I was writing emails, drinking to blackout. I'd get up the next morning and not even aware of those emails. I had a serious problem. … And horrible things I said about Karen spreading her legs. I mean, seriously, Hailey was 14 years old. (cries) I'm just so ashamed and embarrassed about that and I hated that Hailey — that I put Hailey through that. And Chandler, in her own testimony, addressed again that incident when she waited outside Karen Harkness' house to drop off Hailey and Dustin with the couple. She said it was done out of necessity. DANA CHANDLER (in court): I yelled through the window, I could not afford to feed Hailey and Dustin. And that I needed to leave them with him. Chandler contrasted those times to when she stopped drinking, showing videos of her spending time outdoors with Hailey and Dustin. DANA CHANDLER (in court): This video was taken about 9 months into my recovery. Chandler also disputed making frequent harassing calls to Harkness and Sisco, saying when she called, there was a reason. DANA CHANDLER: I was … calling to speak with my children, Hailey, and Dustin. As to her having disagreements with Karen Harkness, she testified there were none. DANA CHANDLER: I never, ever, had any confrontations with Karen Harkness, at all. Chandler also pointed out what she said was sloppiness in the police investigation. When Chandler questioned lead detective Richard Volle, she asked about whether police were too focused on her and should have been looking more thoroughly at other possible suspects. DANA CHANDLER (In court, questioning Volle): Did you or did you not receive any leads for other suspects besides me? DET. RICHARD VOLLE: Uh, early on in the investigation, there were several other people that were looked at as possible leads. … So it's a matter of checking people off, to dismissing people that couldn't have done it. … Uh, when we can't dismiss them, we keep focusing on them, like we did with you. Chandler, though, said there was an area she felt law enforcement thoroughly investigated — whether she bought a .9 mm gun, like the one used in the murders and they came up empty handed. DANA CHANDLER (in court): I've never owned, purchased, or possessed a .9mm firearm. And throughout her defense, Chandler was adamant that at the time of the murders, she was in Colorado, and no one could place her in Harkness' house, or even in Kansas. It seemed like a simple question Chandler was asking Detective Volle. DANA CHANDLER (in court, questioning Volle): Did you ever develop any information that I was in Topeka, Kansas, on July 6th or 7th of 2002? In answering that question, Volle said there was a woman named Patty Williams who may have spotted Chandler in the state of Kansas around the time of the murders. DANA CHANDLER (in court, questioning Volle): What do you know about Patty? DET. RICHARD VOLLE: She was a clerk at a convenience store in WaKeeney, Kansas. The gas station/convenience store in WaKeeney, where Williams worked, was nearly halfway between Denver and Topeka. It had been visited by an investigator, searching for locations where someone may have spotted Chandler around the time of the murders. There, the investigator showed Williams the photo of Chandler seen below. DET. RICHARD VOLLE (in court): She was seven out of 10 that it was you. According to Volle, the clerk was 70 percent sure she had seen Dana Chandler and described some distinguishing features. DET. RICHARD VOLLE (in court): She had, or said that she had gray near the hairline … Chandler though, told the jury, she did not have gray hair back then. By the time of the trials, Williams had died and could not be questioned again. Chandler also expressed concern that the investigator only showed a single photo of her initially, instead of an array of photos, including different people—something Volle did do when he went to the gas station about two weeks later. DET. RICHARD VOLLE (in court): We later — later went out with a — what we call a six-pack photo, it's uh six photographs of people that looked very similar and amongst those photos was Ms. Chandler. Volle said Williams immediately picked out Chandler, and again was 70 percent sure she saw her there. But Volle acknowledged using an array initially would have been better. There was still, for law enforcement, the issue regarding Dana Chandler's alibi. Remember, Volle said Chandler told him she was home in her Denver apartment the night of the murders. But she told others, including an acquaintance, Jeff Bailey, she slept in her car in the Colorado mountains that night. DANA CHANDLER (in court): I was confused … Chandler told the jury she had been confused when she spoke with Volle, but Prosecutor Kitt was not accepting that explanation. CHARLES KITT (in court): So what you told Detective Volle is not consistent with what you told Jeff Bailey, is it? DANA CHANDLER: Uh, as far as my trip to – CHARLES KITT: Ms. Chandler, it's not consistent – DANA CHANDLER: Oh, that part. OK. Yeah. I would agree with that. Um, I would — that's true… Once again, those secret recordings Hailey made with her mother were played in court: DANA CHANDLER: … you ever think about killin' him? HAILEY SEEL:  No, but — DANA CHANDLER: I did. This time, Kitt questioned Chandler herself about its authenticity. CHARLES KITT (in court): Was that your voice saying, \"Did you ever think about killing him?\" \"I did\"? DANA CHANDLER: It sounds like it yes. When it was time for the final witness, Chandler decided it should be Dana Chandler. She knew the jury heard witnesses testify about her parenting and past behavior. Chandler explained if she was a less than an attentive mother, it was because of her drinking and a lack of money, not a lack of love. DANA CHANDLER (in court):  I absolutely did want to have a relationship with my children. You know I think the financial, substance abuse combination, um it just wasn't feasible. So, that's all I have, thank you. Oh, cross. CHARLES KITT (in court): Ms. Chandler, during this time that you couldn't afford to feed your children, you were buying booze, correct? DANA CHANDLER: I was. CHARLES KITT: Buying enough alcohol to get blackout drunk? DANA CHANDLER: I was. CHARLES KITT: OK, thank you. I have no further questions. And with that, after 18 days of testimony, Kitt and Chandler presented their closing arguments. CHARLES KITT (in court): Why are Mike and Karen dead? And the evidence shows one simple answer, control. Hailey Seel: I think Kitt nailed it when he said it was about control. The state described Chandler losing control of Mike Sisco, as he planned his future with Karen Harkness, and the rage that followed. CHARLES KITT (in court): And that's what led to the defendant traveling to Topeka, Kansas, on July 6th and murdering them on July 7th. Kitt spoke about Chandler's depiction of events not lining up with the testimony of others. CHARLES KITT (in court): It's the defendant versus everyone. … You can believe the defendant's testimony, or you can believe everybody else that you heard from in this case. In Chandler's closing, she used a scale to make her point that prosecutors, whom she called her accusers, did not have enough evidence to tip it in their favor. DANA CHANDLER (in court): The, uh, accusers must, uh, tip the scale. Here. I'm innocent. (pointing to scale) DANA CHANDLER (in court): I had my infirmities, and I have my shortcomings, but I do stand here before you all today and proclaim that I am an innocent woman. She acknowledged the life she led was not perfect but said that doesn't make her a murderer. DANA CHANDLER (in court): The state has woefully failed to meet its burden, to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that I killed Mike Sisco or Karen Harkness. About four hours later, the jury delivered its verdict: guilty of the murders of Mike Sisco and Karen Harkness. After hearing the verdict, Chandler turned away. And while it was the verdict Seel hoped for, the end result is nothing she ever wanted. Hailey Seel: It is so much worse that my mom is the one behind these murders because we lost my dad and Karen, but then through all this, now we've lost our mom. … I really wish it was someone else. Darryl Burton: I don't believe that they have proved this case beyond a reasonable doubt. Chandler's supporter, Darryl Burton, remains undeterred. He still believes she is innocent. Darryl Burton: The evidence just doesn't, you know, prove that she's guilty of anything Chandler is filing motions for an appeal. \"48 Hours\" reached out to Chandler again for this episode, but did not receive a response. Mike Kagay: I am very confident in this verdict. District Attorney Mike Kagay is certain the jury convicted the right person. Mike Kagay: I have every confidence in my prosecutors and how they handled this case. Hailey Seel: The focus of this case has gone almost completely to Dana Chandler and that the victims … has really been lost … which is really sad. More than 20 years have passed since Mike Sisco and Karen Harkness were murdered —-and Hailey wants to make sure the lives lost are not forgotten. Hailey Seel: I was trying to tell my daughter about who my dad is. (cries) … and I said … he was a really fun, supportive, encouraging guy who believed in me and my brother. …And Karen … was so kind, so accepting. … I miss them a lot.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 31, 2025 / 10:01 PM EDT/ CBS News The White House is pulling the nomination forbillionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, President Trump's pick to lead NASA, just days before a Senate confirmation vote was set to take place. \"After a thorough review of prior associations, I am hereby withdrawing the nomination of Jared Isaacman to head NASA,\" Mr. Trump wrote in a Truth Social post Saturday night. \"I will soon announce a new Nominee who will be Mission aligned, and put America First in Space.\" White House spokeswoman Elizabeth Huston told CBS News in an earlier statement that the next administrator for NASA will \"help lead humanity into space and execute President Trump's bold mission of planting the American flag on the planet Mars.\" \"It's essential that the next leader of NASA is in complete alignment with President Trump's America First agenda and a replacement will be announced directly by President Trump soon,\" Huston said. Huston did not give a reason as to why the White House was withdrawing its nomination. Isaacman, a skilled pilot who flies his own MiG-29 fighter jet, has not publicly commented on the White House's decision.Semaforfirst reported the news. Ahead of taking office earlier this year, Mr. Trump picked Isaacman, a veteran private astronaut with strong ties to Elon Musk and his rocket company SpaceX, to serve as NASA's next administrator. He would have been NASA's fifth administrator after former Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, who flew into orbit aboard the space shuttle Columbia in early 1986. On his X platform, MuskrespondedSaturday to a post about Isaacman's nomination being withdrawn, writing, \"It is rare to find someone so competent and good-hearted.\" Isaacman's nomination advanced through theSenate's Commerce Committee in Apriland the Senate was set to vote after returning from the Memorial Day recess next week. In a social media post after Mr. Trump's nomination announcement in December, Isaacman, 42, said NASA can expect him to be a vocal space advocate who would help \"usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilization.\" \"With the support of President Trump, I can promise you this: We will never again lose our ability to journey to the stars and never settle for second place,\" Isaacman saidat the time. \"We will inspire children, yours and mine, to look up and dream of what is possible. Americans will walk on the moon and Mars and in doing so, we will make life better here on Earth.\" William  HarwoodandOlivia  Rinaldicontributed to this report.

    "title": "Millions of bees escape after truck overturns in Washington state",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 31, 2025 / 9:56 PM EDT/ CBS News Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying more than 70,000 pounds of pollinator hives rolled over Friday in northern Washington state, authorities said. The commercial truck hauling the honeybees overturned at about 4 a.m. in Whatcom County, Washington, which borders Canada's British Columbia, the sheriff's office said in asocial media post. It's unclear what caused the truck to roll over. The hives came off the truck shortly after 9 a.m., which freed the bees. The incident happened on Weidkamp Road, which remains closed between Loomis Trail and West Badger roads, the Whatcom County Sheriff's Office said. Authorities said the public should avoid the area and stay at least 600 feet away. \"While there is no general health risk to the public, anyone who is allergic to bee stings or has concerns should check the State Department of Health webpage on bees and wasps,\" the sheriff's office said. Authorities said the road where the truck overturned was closed for about 24 hours to allow the bees to re-hive and find their queen bee. More than two dozen beekeepers came to assist with the rescue, the sheriff's office said, adding: \"The goal is to save as many of the bees as possible.\" \"At this time, on-scene work is done. Hive boxes from the overturned truck were recovered, restored and returned to use,\" authorities said in an update. \"By morning, most bees should have returned to their hives and those responsible for their delivery will be in charge.\" Initially, officials said that some 250 million bees escaped but they corrected the tally on Saturday, citing a beekeeper who assisted at the scene. \"Thank you to those who challenged the math and helped us get closer to the true number,\" officials said. EDITOR'S NOTE:Initial information on the number of bees provided by the Whatcom County Sheriff's Office was inaccurate and the story has been corrected.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 31, 2025 / 9:52 PM EDT/ CBS News An international crew of four men and two women blasted off and rocketed to the edge of space Saturday, enjoying a few minutes of weightlessness and an out-of-this-world view before plunging back to Earth to wrap up Blue Origin's twelfthNew Shepardpassenger flight. \"It was such an incredible ride, very moving, very spiritual,\" Panamanian attorney Jaime Alemán, a former ambassador to the United States, said after landing. \"Even better than I ever imagined. I've been traveling, thanks to the gods, all my life, this was like the cherry on top of a cake. I mean, to go up in space and see how huge it is,  you can only begin to imagine how much more there is still to discover.\" Blue Origin's hydrogen-fueled single-stage booster roared to life at 9:39 a.m. EDT and quickly climbed away from the company's West Texas launch site, accelerating to just over 2,000 mph before releasing the New Shepard spacecraft. The crew capsule, equipped with the largest windows of any operational spaceship, continued coasting up to an altitude of nearly 65 miles, just above the internationally recognized boundary between the discernible atmosphere and space, before beginning the descent to landing. At the moment the capsule was released, its three American passengers — Aymette Medina Jorge, Gretchen Green and Paul Jeris  — along with Alemán, Canadian Jesse Williams and New Zealand's Mark Rocket, began enjoying about three minutes of weightlessness as they coasted upwards. The reusable New Shepard booster, meanwhile, also continued upward before slowing and beginning its on tail-first descent. Seven minutes after liftoff, the rocket's BE-3 engine re-ignited, four landing legs deployed and the booster settled to a picture-perfect touchdown on a landing pad near the launch site. The gumdrop-shaped New Shepard capsule took a more leisurely flight home, descending under three large parachutes to touchdown in the West Texas desert 10 minutes after liftoff. \"You guys, we did it!\" one of the passengers exclaimed. Blue Origin has now launched 12 passenger flights since the sub-orbital spacecraft carried Amazon- andBlue Origin-founder Jeff Bezos and three others aloft in July 2021.The company has now launched 68 passengers, including four who have flown twice. Blue Origin and its passengers do not reveal how much it costs to fly aboard a New Shepard, but it's estimated to cost upwards of $500,000 per seat. Jorge's seat was sponsored by Farmacias Similares, a Mexican company focused on accessible healthcare across Latin America. Her crewmates presumably paid for their own tickets. Blue Origin has had the sub-orbital passenger market to itself since June 2024 when competitorVirgin Galactic,founded by entrepreneur Richard Branson, retired its original rocketplane to focus on building two upgraded Delta-class spacecraft. Virgin is expected to resume flights next year.

    "title": "Hamas says it responded to ceasefire proposal",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 31, 2025 / 9:51 PM EDT/ CBS/AP Hamas said Saturday it has responded to a U.S.-led proposal for a temporary ceasefire in theGaza Strip, which Israeli officials have approved, but will seek amendments. Additional details of the response were not immediately known. In a statement, the militant group said its response aims to achieve a permanent ceasefire, the Israeli military's complete withdrawal from Gaza and the \"unimpeded flow of humanitarian aid.\" Hamas said in their statement that the agreement would include the release of 10 living Israeli hostages and the remains of 18 hostages in exchange for a number of Palestinian prisoners. A senior Hamas official tells The Associated Press that \"there some notes and amendments to some points, especially on the U.S. guarantees, the timing of hostage release, the delivery of aid and the withdrawal of Israeli forces.\" The official spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the talks. The office of Steve Witkoff, the U.S. envoy to the Middle East, said in a statement onsocial mediaon Saturday that it had received Hamas' response to the proposal, but it was \"totally unacceptable and only takes us backward.\" \"Hamas should accept the framework proposal we put forward as the basis for proximity talks, which we can begin immediately this coming week,\" the statement said. \"That is the only way we can close a 60-day ceasefire deal in the coming days in which half of the living hostages and half of those who are deceased will come home to their families and in which we can have at the proximity talks substantive negotiations in good-faith to try to reach a permanent ceasefire.\" Basem Naim, a member of Hamas' political bureau, said in a statement that Hamas did not reject Witkoff's proposal. \"Nevertheless, we now responded positively and responsibly in a manner that fulfilled the minimum of demands and aspirations of our people,\" Naim said in a statement. \"Why, each time, is the Israeli response considered the only response for negotiation? This violates the integrity and fairness of mediation and constitutes a complete bias towards the other side.\" Adraft of the deal obtained by CBS Newsindicated that Israel would release 125 \"life sentence\" prisoners and 1,111 Palestinian detainees as part of the deal, as well as 180 deceased Palestinians. The draft also outlined that humanitarian aid will be sent into Gaza immediately once Hamas agrees to the deal. There was no immediate response from mediators or Israeli officials. President Trump said on Friday that negotiators were nearing a deal. Meanwhile, the U.N. Food Program said Saturday that 77 trucks carrying aid, mostly flour, were stopped by hungry people who took the food before the trucks were able to reach their destination. \"After nearly 80 days of total blockade, communities are starving – and they are no longer willing to watch food pass them by,\" the WFP said in a statement. \"This delivery is a start, but it's not nearly enough.\" A nearly three-month Israeli blockade on Gaza has pushed the population of nearly 2.3 million people to the brink of famine. While the pressure slightly eased in recent days as Israel allowed some aid to enter, organizations say there still isn't nearly enough food getting in. The United Nations has called Gaza the \"hungriest place on Earth.\" \"To restore home, ease fear, and prevent further chaos, we must flood communities with food – now,\" the WFP said. \"Only consistent, large-scale aid can rebuild trust.\" A witness in the southern city of Khan Younis told The Associated Press the U.N. convoy was stopped at a makeshift roadblock and offloaded by desperate civilians in their thousands. Most people carried bags of flour on their backs or heads. He said at one point a forklift was used to offload pallets from the stranded trucks. The witness spoke on condition of anonymity because of fear of reprisal. The United Nations said earlier this month that Israeli authorities have forced them to use unsecured routes within areas controlled by the Israeli military in the eastern areas of Rafah and Khan Younis, where armed gangs are active and trucks were stopped. Israel's military didn't immediately respond for comment. An internal document shared with aid groups about security incidents, seen by the Associated Press, said there were four incidents of facilities being looted in three days at the end of May, not including the convoy on Saturday. The U.N. says it's been unable to get enough aid in because of fighting. On Friday, U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said it only picked up five truckloads of cargo from the Palestinian side of the Kareem Shalom crossing, and the other 60 trucks had to return due to intense hostilities in the area. An Israeli official said his country has offered the U.N. logistical and operational support but \"the U.N. is not doing their job.\" Instead, a new U.S- and Israeli-backed foundation started operations in Gaza this week, distributing food at several sites in a chaotic rollout. Israel saysthe Gaza Humanitarian Foundationwill replace the massive aid operation that the U.N. and others have carried out throughout the war. It says the new mechanism is necessary, accusing Hamas of siphoning off large amounts of aid. The U.N. denies that a significant diversion takes place. Cindy McCain, the WFP's executive director, told\"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" last Sundaythat there is no evidence to support Israel's claims that Hamas is responsible for the looting of their aid trucks. \"These people are desperate, and they see a World Food Programme truck coming in, and they run for it,\" she said. \"This doesn't have anything to do with Hamas or any kind of organized crime, or anything. It has simply to do with the fact these people are starving to death.\" Meanwhile, Israel is continuing its military campaign across Gaza. The Gaza Health Ministry said that at least 60 people were killed by Israeli strikes in the last 24 hours. It said three people were shot by Israeli gunfire early Saturday morning in the southern city of Rafah. Three other people were killed, parents and a child, when their car was struck in Gaza City. The war began when Hamas terrorists attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and taking 250 hostages. Of those taken captive, 58 remain in Gaza, but Israel believes 35 are dead, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said there are \"doubts\" about the fate of several others. Israeli strikes have killed more than 54,000 Gaza residents, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its tally. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "Concern grows over whether the Hollywood industry can survive in California",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 31, 2025 / 9:48 PM EDT/ CBS News Los Angeles— For years, Phil Mangano made a good living as a film and television editor in Los Angeles. \"It was just job after job after job,\" Mangano told CBS News. \"…Very consistent work.\" But afterHollywood writersandactorswent on monthslong strikes in 2023, production ground to a halt. California lost roughly 40,000 film and tv jobs that year alone, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"When that finally settled, we were like, OK, great, things will come back,\" Mangano said. \"And there has been no significant increase in job opportunities.\" Since its peak in 2021, television production in the greater Los Angeles area has decreased by 58%, according to the nonprofit group FilmLA, which handles film permitting for the city and county of Los Angeles. The number of shoot days for television fell from 18,560 in 2021 to 7,716 in 2024. And in the first quarter of 2025, on-location production in L.A.declinedby 22.4% from the same period last year, per numbers from FilmLA. \"Right now, it's a triage situation. The patient is dying and you need to bring it back to life,\" Matthew Belloni, who covers show business for Puck News and hosts the popular podcast \"The Town,\" told CBS News. Belloni says Hollywood productions, and hence the jobs, have gone to other U.S. states and other countries who are willing to offer generous tax incentives. \"Some European countries that are offering up to 40% back on these productions,\" Belloni said. \"And that's incredibly influential.\" California Gov. Gavin Newsomwants to stop the bleedingby more than doubling the state's annual film and TV tax credits from $330 million to $750 million. \"Film and film making, pre and post-production, it's on life support,\" Newsom told reporters earlier this month. \"L.A. County and L.A. city are struggling.\" But is the proposal too little too late? \"The sad reality is that California has sat on this issue for 30 years,\" Belloni said. Belloni is unsure if California can provide enough tax credits to offset the high cost of working in the state. \"Other jurisdictions have done their own aggressive cuts to that bureaucracy,\" Belloni said. \"Is California willing to do that? Don't know.\" In the meantime, Mangano and thousands of others in Hollywood are looking for whatever work they can find. \"I applied for a job at Costco a couple months ago,\" said Mangano, who adds that he cannot hold out \"much longer.\" \"I have a little savings left,\" he adds. \"We're hoping that'll float us for a few more months. And then we have to start making some hard decisions…Whether or not we can keep the house.\" Carter Evans has served as a Los Angeles-based correspondent for CBS News since February 2013, reporting across all of the network's platforms.

    "title": "Canadian wildfires force tens of thousands to evacuate",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 31, 2025 / 9:24 PM EDT/ CBS/AP Roughly 17,000 residents in the Canadian province of Manitoba have been evacuated because of nearlytwo dozen active wildfires, officials said Saturday. More than 5,000 of those are from Flin Flon, where there is no rain in the immediate forecast. There have been no structure fires in the city located nearly 400 miles northwest of the provincial capital of Winnipeg as of Saturday morning, but officials worry that a change in wind direction could bring the fire into town. Manitoba declared a state of emergency on Wednesday as the fires burning from the northwest to the southeast forced evacuations in several communities in the province directly north of the U.S. states of Minnesota and North Dakota. Smoke from the fires is being pushed south into some parts of the U.S., worsening air quality. Thousands have also been affected by wildfires in Saskatchewan and Alberta, with 1,300 people in the community of Swan Hills northwest of Edmonton forced from their homes. Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe told a news conference Saturday that ongoing hot, dry weather is allowing some fires to grow and threaten communities, and that the current figure of 8,000 fire evacuees could climb to 10,000. Resources to fight the fires and support the evacuees are stretched thin, Moe said. \"The next four to seven days are absolutely critical until we can find our way to changing weather patterns, and ultimately a soaking rain throughout the north,\" Moe said. As of Saturday evening, 188 active fires were burning across Canada,according tothe Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. Of those, 100 were considering to be burning \"out of control.\" Smoke from the wildfires was expected to drift down into the U.S., with air quality alerts issued for portions of the Upper Midwest. \"Smoke from Canadian wildfires continue to spread across the skies across much of the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes,\" the National Weather Service wrote. \"…The smoke will also create air quality issues at times, mainly for sensitive groups.\" Canada's wildfire season runs from May through September.Its worst-ever wildfire seasonwas in 2023. It choked much of North America with dangerous smoke for months. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service said Saturday it has deployed an air tanker to Alberta, and the U.S. is sending 150 firefighters and equipment like sprinkler kits, pumps and hoses to Canada. \"We are here to help our neighbors during their time of need, and our Forest Service Wildland Firefighters are the best in the business. I am thankful for the men and women who are bravely stepping up to serve,\" U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke L. Rollins said in a statement. In northern Manitoba, fire knocked out power to the community of Cranberry Portage, forcing a mandatory evacuation order Saturday for about 600 residents. People living in smaller nearby communities were told to prepare to evacuate after a fire jumped a highway. \"Please start getting ready and making plans to stay with family and friends as accommodations are extremely limited,\" Lori Forbes, the emergency coordinator for the Rural Municipality of Kelsey, posted on social media. Evacuation centers have opened across the province for those fleeing the fires, including one as far south as Winkler, Manitoba, 12 miles from the U.S. border. Evacuations that started earlier in the week for Pimicikamak Cree Nation ramped up Saturday, when five flights were expected to take residents to Winnipeg. \"The wildfire has crossed the main road, and the area remains filled with smoke and ash,\" Chief David Monias wrote on social media. Winnipeg has opened up public buildings for evacuees as it deals with hotels already crammed with other fire refugees, vacationers, business people and convention-goers. Manitoba's Indigenous leaders, including Monias, told a news conference on Saturday that hotel rooms in the cities where evacuees are arriving are full, and they called on the government to direct hotel owners to give evacuees priority. Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs Grand Chief Kyra Wilson said it was one of the largest evacuations in the province since the 1990s. \"It's really sad to see our children having to sleep on floors. People are sitting, waiting in hallways, waiting outside, and right now we just need people to come together. People are tired,\" Wilson said at the news conference. \"We need to make sure that we have space for our people.\" The fire menacing Flin Flon began Monday near Creighton, Saskatchewan, and quickly jumped the boundary into Manitoba. Crews have struggled to contain it. Water bombers have been intermittently grounded due to heavy smoke and a drone incursion. The 1,200 or so residents of Creighton have also been ordered out, many of whom have gone to nearby Nipawin, Saskatchewan. In total, more than 8,000 people have fled wildfires in Saskatchewan. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

    "article_text": "The badly burned body of a young man was found Saturday in Georgia's Stone Mountain Park, authorities said. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is helping local authorities investigate the discovery, spokesperson Nelly Miles said. Stone Mountain Department of Public Safety spokesperson John Bankhead said an autopsy by the DeKalb County Medical Examiner's Office was scheduled for Monday. A hiker came across the body and reported it to authorities at about 8:18 a.m. Saturday, Bankhead said by phone. He described the location of the discovery as the side of the mountain opposite its walking trail and about 100 or more yards from a tower for its Summit Skyride, a Swiss cable car line to the top. Bankhead said the location is not remote but is rarely hiked. \"I hike here all the time and I didn't know that was there,\" he said. The spokesperson told NBC affiliateWXIA of Atlanta:\"It’s very odd, peculiar, no one that I’ve talked to that’s worked out here for years has seen anything like this at the park.\" He said Saturday night that authorities have a prospective identity for the man but have not verified it. Personal belongings, including a vehicle parked in the area, led investigators to the possible name, he said. Authorities told WXIA that the fire associated with the body was also a focus for DeKalb County Fire Rescue Department arson investigators. The park includes attractions like a lakeside resort and is run by a state authority and an amusement park management contractor. It has drawndemonstrations and split opinionsover what the park describes as the \"largest high relief sculpture in the world\" — a depiction of Confederate figures Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee and Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson. The first part of the sculpture was completed in 1924 and the last in 1972. The mountain is about 20 miles east of Atlanta.",

    "article_text": "The Indiana Pacers advanced to the NBA Finals on Saturday, defeating the New York Knicks 125-108 in Game 6 of their conference finals matchup. A year ago, the Pacers fell one round short of the championship series after losing in a four-game sweep to the Boston Celtics. This time, Indiana needed only five games to dispatch the Knicks, a longtime rival of the franchise. The Pacers will face the Thunder in the finals, with the series starting on June 5 in Oklahoma City. The Thunder were the NBA’s best team during the regular season, winning 68 games. Oklahoma City will have home-court advantage in the upcoming series. Indiana was led to the championship round by point guard Tyrese Haliburton. Entering Game 6 against the Knicks, Haliburton was averaging 21.0 points, 6.0 rebounds and 10.0 assists in the series. The Pacers acquired the star guard midway through the 2021-22 season, trading All-Star forward Domantas Sabonis in exchange for Haliburton in a move that shocked the NBA. The ensuing summer, Indiana drafted guard Aaron Nembhard and traded for swingman Aaron Nesmith, both of whom have since played pivotal roles in the team’s starting lineup. The Pacers also traded last season for forward Pascal Siakam, who was named to his third All-Star team earlier this year. Indiana is known for its frenetic style of play. During the regular season, the Pacers finished seventh in the NBA in pace. The team has been one of the league’s best since the new year, posting a 34-14 record after January 1, fourth-best in the NBA. Indiana finished fourth in the East after the hot close to the season, and then knocked off the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round for the second straight year. In the second round, the Pacers upset the 64-win Cleveland Cavaliers in only five games, taking out the conference’s top-seeded team. Then in the third, Indiana defeated New York in another postseason rematch from 2024. The Pacers’ head coach is Rick Carlisle, who was previously an assistant for Indiana from 1997 to 2000, and then the team’s head coach from 2003 to 2007. Carlisle was the head coach of the Dallas Mavericks from 2008 to 2021, winning a championship with the team in 2011.

    "title": "At least 7 dead, 30 hurt as bridge collapse causes train derailment in Russia",
    "article_text": "MOSCOW — A passenger train derailed in western Russia late Saturday, killing at least seven people and injuring 30, after a bridge collapsed because of what local officials described as \"illegal interference.\" The bridge in Russia's Bryansk region, which borders Ukraine, was damaged \"as a result of illegal interference in transport operations,\" Moscow Railways said in a statement, without elaborating. Russia's federal road transportation agency, Rosavtodor, said the destroyed bridge passed above the railway tracks where the train was traveling. Photos posted by government agencies from the scene appeared to show passenger cars from the train ripped apart and lying amid fallen concrete from the collapsed bridge. Other footage on social media appeared to be taken from inside other vehicles that narrowly avoided driving onto the bridge before it collapsed. Bryansk regional Gov. Alexander Bogomaz said emergency services and government officials were working at the scene. He said seven people died and two children were among the 30 injured. \"Everything is being done to provide all necessary assistance to the victims,\" he said. Russian officials have not said who is responsible for Saturday's incident, but in the past some officials have accused pro-Ukrainian saboteurs of attacking Russia's railway infrastructure. The details surrounding such incidents, however, are limited and cannot be independently verified. Ukrainian media outlets reported in December 2023 that Kyiv's top spy agency had successfully carried out two explosions on a railroad line in Siberia that serves as a key conduit for trade between Russia and China. Ukraine's security services did not comment on the reports. Russian Railways confirmed one of the explosions described by Ukrainian media, but did not say what had caused it. There was no comment from Russian authorities on a second explosion.",

    "title": "Hamas seeks changes to Gaza ceasefire proposal but US envoy calls it 'unacceptable'",
    "article_text": "The conflict between Israel and Palestinians — and other groups in the Middle East — goes back decades. These stories provide context for current developments and the history that led up to them. By The Associated Press A demonstrator takes part in a performance during a protest demanding the end of the war and immediate release of hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government in Tel Aviv, Saturday, May 31, 2025.Ariel Schalit/APhide caption TEL AVIV, Israel  — Hamas is seeking amendments to the latest U.S. ceasefire proposal for Gaza, a senior official with the group told The Associated Press on Saturday, but U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff called the Hamas response \"totally unacceptable.\" The latest friction in negotiations comes as the fighting nears 20 months of war, and as desperation grows among hungry Palestinians and relatives of hostages in Gaza. The Hamas official, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the talks, said proposed amendments focused on \"the U.S. guarantees, the timing of hostage release, the delivery of aid and the withdrawal of Israeli forces.\" There were no details. A separate Hamas statement said the proposal aims for a permanent ceasefire, a comprehensive Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and an ensured flow of aid. It said 10 living hostages and the bodies of 18 others would be released \" in exchange for an agreed-upon number of Palestinian prisoners.\" Fifty-eight hostages remain and Israel believes 35 are dead. Witkoff on social media instead described a 60-day ceasefire deal that would free half the living hostages in Gaza and return half of those who have died. He urged Hamas to accept the framework proposal as the basis for talks that he said could begin next week. Israeli officials have approved the U.S. proposal for a temporary ceasefire. U.S. President Donald Trump has said negotiators were nearing a deal. People take part in a protest demanding the end of the war and immediate release of hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, in Tel Aviv, Saturday, May 31, 2025.Ariel Schalit/APhide caption A top Hamas official, Bassem Naim, accused Israel of disagreeing with agreed-upon provisions and alleged a \"complete bias toward the other side\" that he said violates the fairness of mediation. \"We want the bloodshed to stop,\" Motasim, a man from the Al-Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza, said of the talks. \"I swear to God, we are tired.\" Palestinians in Gaza blocked and offloaded 77 food trucks, the U.N. World Food Program said, as hunger mounts following Israel's monthslong blockade of the territory. The WFP said the aid, mostly flour, was taken before the trucks could reach their destination. A witness in the southern city of Khan Younis, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, told the AP the U.N. convoy was stopped at a makeshift roadblock and offloaded by desperate civilians in their thousands. The nearly three-month blockade on Gaza has pushed the population of over 2 million to the brink of famine. While Israel allowed some aid to enter in recent days, aid organizations say far from enough is getting in. Israel's military body in charge of aid coordination in Gaza, COGAT, said 579 trucks of aid had entered over the past week. The U.N. has said 600 per day were entering under the previous ceasefire that Israel ended with new bombardment. The WFP said the fear of starvation in Gaza is high. \"We need to flood communities with food for the next few days to calm anxieties,\" it said in a statement. It added that it has over 140,000 metric tons of food — enough to feed Gazans for two months — ready to be brought in. The United Nations said earlier this month that Israeli authorities have forced them to use unsecured routes within areas controlled by Israel's military in the eastern areas of Rafah and Khan Younis, where armed gangs are active and trucks were stopped. An internal document shared with aid groups about security incidents, seen by the AP, said there were four incidents of facilities being looted in three days at the end of May, not including Saturday's. The U.N. says it has been unable to get enough aid in because of fighting. A new U.S- and Israeli-backed foundation started operations in Gaza this week, distributing food at several sites in a chaotic rollout. Israel says the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation eventually will replace the aid operation by the U.N. and others. It says the new mechanism is necessary, accusing Hamas of siphoning off large amounts of aid. The U.N. denies that significant diversion takes place. A young Palestinian waits to collect donated food at a food distribution kitchen in Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip, Friday, May 30, 2025.Abdel Kareem Hana/APhide caption The GHF works with armed contractors, which it says are needed to distribute food safely. Aid groups have accused the foundation of militarizing aid. The GHF said it distributed 30 truckloads of food on Saturday and called it their largest distribution so far. Israel continued its military campaign across Gaza, saying it struck dozens of targets over the past day. Gaza's Health Ministry said at least 60 people were killed by Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours. The ministry said three people were killed by Israeli gunfire early Saturday in Rafah. Three others were killed — parents and a child — when their car was struck in Gaza City. An Israeli strike hit another car in Gaza City, killing four. And an Israeli strike hit a tent sheltering displaced people in Khan Younis, killing six, said Weam Fares, a spokesperson for Nasser Hospital. Israel's military said several projectiles from Gaza fell in open areas. The war began when Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and taking 250 hostages. Israeli strikes have killed more than 54,000 Gaza residents, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its tally. A group of hostages' relatives again pleaded for a comprehensive ceasefire deal that would free everyone at once, saying the remaining hostages \"will not survive continued military pressure.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "The Indiana Pacers and Oklahoma City Thunder will meet in the NBA Finals",
    "article_text": "Becky Sullivan Obi Toppin of the Indiana Pacers celebrates a basket against the New York Knicks during Game Six of the Eastern Conference Finals of the 2025 NBA Playoffs on Saturday in Indianapolis. The Pacers defeated the Knicks 4-2 to advance to the NBA Finals against the Oklahoma City Thunder.Gregory Shamus/Getty Imageshide caption Oklahoma City Thunder fans have waited for an NBA title since their team arrived in town in 2008. For fans of the Indiana Pacers, who joined the NBA way back in 1976, the wait for a championship has lastednearly 50 years. Now, for one team, that drought is about to end. The Thunder and the Pacers will meet in this year's NBA Finals for the chance to finally bring a trophy home. Before moving to Oklahoma City and rebranding as the Thunder, the teamwon a title in 1979as the Seattle SuperSonics. Soon after the team relocated in 2008, the Thunder were contenders and reached the Finals in 2012. But that generation of the team was unable to capitalize on an ultra-talented roster (with Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook and James Harden), and the Thunder had been unable to return to the Finals — until now, after dispatching the Minnesota Timberwolves 4 games to 1. The Pacers have reached the NBA Finals only once in franchise history, in 2000, when they fell to the back-to-back-to-back Los Angeles Lakers championship squad. Indiana clinched its spot Saturday night after winning a thrilling Eastern Conference Finals against the New York Knicks in six games. The opening game in the best-of-seven Finals will tip off Thursday, June 5. The Thunder have had one of the most dominant seasons in NBA history. At 68-14, Oklahoma City had the best record in the regular season, during which they outscored opponents by 12.9 points per game —an NBA record. Their success this year has come on the strength of their young core trio of superstar Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, wing Jalen Williams and seven-footer Chet Holmgren. Holmgren is 23, Williams is 24 and Gilgeous-Alexander, who was named league MVP after leading the NBA in scoring this season, is only 26. The Oklahoma City Thunder's success this year has come on the strength of their young core trio of superstar Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (right), wing Jalen Williams and seven-footer Chet Holmgren. Gilgeous-Alexander, who was named league MVP after leading the NBA in scoring this season, is only 26.William Purnell/Getty Imageshide caption That dominance continued in the Western Conference Finals, in which the Thunder sent the Minneapolis Timberwolves packing with margins of victory of 26, 15, 2 and 30 points. The No. 4 seed Pacers, on the other hand, upset the New York Knicks in a tight series in which several games were winnable by either team in the final minutes. In the series-clinching Game 6, the Pacers won 125-108. \"Some of the shot-making in this series has been really beyond belief,\" head coach Rick Carlisle said after Indiana's win in Game 4. \"When you can get a stop and a rebound, it almost feels like an anomaly sometimes.\" For Indiana point guard Tyrese Haliburton, these playoffs have been a coming-out party. Just a month ago, an anonymous player poll conducted byThe Athleticnamed Haliburton the league's \"most overrated player.\" During the Eastern Conference Finals, he shined, with a flawless triple-double performance in Game 4 and another 21 points Saturday in Game 6. Forward Pascal Siakam won the Eastern Conference Finals MVP. Indiana and Oklahoma City are two of the smallest media markets in the NBA. The Indianapolis metro area is home to about 2.1 million people. Oklahoma City is smaller, with around 1.5 million people in the metro. But the success of the teams has invigorated both cities — especially in Oklahoma, where the Thunder are the only major professional sports team in the entire state. No matter which team wins, this Finals will see the seventh different champion over the past seven years, a remarkable display of parity in the modern NBA. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "The world’snext hot monsteris here. At its big Tudum event, Netflix released the first teaser trailer for Guillermo del Toro’s latest film,Frankenstein.In it, audiencesfinally catch a glimpseof Jacob Elordi as Frankenstein’s monster. A monster that is scary, but in a way thatmakes death seem okay. Thankfully, that’s juxtaposed with the type of gore and scope one expects from Del Toro. The Oscar-winning director ofThe Shape of Water, Pan’s Labyrinth, Pacific Rim, Hellboyand others has been wanting to make his version of the classic Mary Shelley story for years now, and with the help of Oscar Isaac, Christoph Waltz, and Mia Goth, he’s done just that. Here’s the first trailer forFrankenstein. ThoughFrankensteinwas produced and will live on Netflix, we certainly hope audiences have a chance to see it on a big screen. Guillermo del Toro is one of those filmmakers whose work begs to be seen in a theater, andFrankensteinlooks to fit the bill once again. It’s all there in the trailerâincredible sets, beautiful visual effects, stunning costumes, gruesome makeup, you name it. We’re also very curious about whereFrankensteinis going to fit into the awards cycle at the end of this year. With a cast and crew like this, you’d imagine Netflix is expectingFrankensteinto be a contender for all the major awards. And, frankly, fans like you and I expect the movie to be good enough to do so. However, a project like this, one that seems so incredible on paper, often doesn’t meet those expectations. How could it? This is the ultimate monster story from the ultimate monster filmmaker! After seeing this trailer, though, we think maybe this will live up to its potential Frankenstein, directed by Guillermo del Toro and starring Jacob Elordi, Oscar Isaac, Mia Goth, and Christoph Waltz, comes to Netflix in November.

It’s safe to assume he’s just as vengeance-motivated as ever, especially after losing his bestie, Player 390, in its bloody climax. Also back for more:Squid Game‘s most fascinatingly complex character, Player 001, aka the Front Man, aka In-ho (Lee Byung-hun), whose vicious deception has yet to be revealed to his fellow gamers.

    "title": "'The soundtrack to skate parks was punk rock music': Tony Hawk on the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater soundtracks, and how they shaped a generation of videogame skate kids",
    "article_text": "Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 has to live up to a proud musical legacy. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's difficult to think of games whose soundtrack had a bigger impact on an entire generation than the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series. Popular music had been a part of games for decades:Journey Escapefor the Atari 2600 was a particularly weird example, and the use of Song 2 by Blur in FIFA: Road to World Cup 98 was iconic. But the Tony Hawk series was the first to usepunkmusic in this way, and for many kids from the suburbs and the country, it was the first time they interacted with punk. The structure of bite-sized two-minute levels was perfect for putting the music at the heart of the game as much as the skating was. The punk—or maybe hip hop or thrash—charging over each run became inextricably linked to skating, even for kids who had never touched a board or been to a park. At the recent THPS Fest in Los Angeles, celebrating both the impending release of the new Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 remake and the legacy of the soundtracks in general, I spoke to some of the people involved with the music of the Tony Hawk games. Here's what legends of skating and music had to say about their enduring legacy. For Hawk himself, all of his aims for the game came back to one thing. \"I thought it was important to represent the culture of skating, and the culture of skating in my early days was early punk rock music. ThenActivision's music department wanted to keep it balanced with newer music as well, so they leaned in towards newer punk at the time, and it's crazy to think that Goldfinger was ever new,\" Hawk says, sitting in his trailer before the THPS Fest concert. \"Also, just other sounds that represent skating, like hip hop. So the music was important to me, but I didn't think it was going to be something that would be a standalone hit, in terms of people saying 'Oh, we can't wait to hear about the soundtrack to the game'.\" It's coming full circle now Those lofty expectations mean updating the soundtrack for Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 + 4 had added pressure—you're updating something people view through almost 25 years of nostalgia goggles. This time Hawk was more involved in the soundtrack of his namesake. \"I guess it's a lot to live up to, but I am proud of all the soundtracks, including this new one. I had more input this time too, so I hope it lives up to the expectations.\" Steve Caballero was a pro skater featured as a playable character in the games and now, at the age of 60, his latest punk band Urethane has a song featured on the 3 + 4 soundtrack. When the original games were coming out he was in the privileged position of getting to pick songs for the soundtrack that would also feature in his skating video at the end of the game. \"Skateboarding is gnarly,\" he says, \"and so when you have a punk song driving a part, it flows really well. I just picked music that I felt would go with my video part. For number two I asked for Millencolin, and for 3 I brought Bodyjar from Australia. It's coming full circle now because Bodyjar is back in Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 + 4 and we're touring with Bodyjar this summer.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Lupe Fiasco is the artist behind the most famous skateboarding hip hop track of all time: Kick, Push. It was first included on Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam, a departure from the Pro Skater and Underground titles. Now it's being featured in a main Pro Skater soundtrack for the first time. \"It feels good,\" Fiasco says. \"Licensing companies are gonna license. You've got to let them do that when they want to do it,\" he laughs. \"No, Tony's a homie. When Kick, Push first came out, he was one of the first skaters of note to invite me out to L. A. to perform it at one of the events, so this is kind of a full circle situation.\" One of the striking things about these conversations are how down to earth all the skaters and musicians in the culture are. The godfather of freestyle skateboarding, Rodney Mullen invented a shocking number of tricks, including the kickflip—he also has a surprising air of humility given all his achievements. According to him, the soundtrack is one of the main reasons why the game was so successful. People tend to find their music between the ages of, like, 9 or 10, up till 13 years old, and a lot of people found it at that time. \"They created something so enduring and special that it stood above everything else,\" Mullen says. \"I think the way that Tony included all of those bands and the music, the way that he reached outside culture—even if you didn't skate, you appreciated the vibe. It conveyed the texture of what the culture is. Street art, everything else. All of it worked together to make it something distinct and different from anything that's ever been done before. That's why it's lasted so long.\" Of course, as with all things that have significant impacts on culture, it's not just the thing itself. It has to find the right people at the right time to have an effect, and Mullen posits that while having all the ingredients for success was important, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater was definitely in the right place at the right time. \"There's a magic era in all things, right? So much was happening in terms of music, everything.\" For what it’s worth, Hawk agrees that timing is why the soundtrack had the impact it did. \"I think it introduced a generation that was impressionable. People tend to find their music between the ages of, like, 9 or 10, up till 13 years old, and a lot of people found it at that time. But they truly liked it, it wasn't like it was just being forced upon them. But it was the same for me. I started skating when I was 10. The soundtrack to skate parks was punk rock music. It was Devo, Dead Kennedys, Buzzcocks, Black Flag, Agent Orange, and that's what I heard while I was skating, and that's what I associated with skating.\" While you can never go back and experience the things that changed you for the first time again, this golden age of remasters and remakes means the millennials who fell in love with this music and culture at the right place and the right time can revisit it. The expanded Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 + 4 soundtrack also means those now-middle-aged millennials can discover even more new music, while artists such as Caballero prove that we don't ever have to stop finding and making new music. With everything Y2K coming back in fashion again, perhaps a whole new generation of kids are about to fall in love with punk music through videogames.

Previous Wordle solutions can help to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer isn't likely to be repeated. They can also give you some solid ideas for starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. Here are some recent Wordle answers: There are six rows of five boxes presented to you by Wordle each day, and you'll need to work out which five-letter word is hiding among them to win the daily puzzle. Start with a strong wordlike ALIVE—or any other word with a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You should also avoid starting words with repeating letters, so you don't waste the chance to confirm or eliminate an extra letter. Once you've typed your guess and hit Enter, you'll see which letters you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the first, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you might have missed on the first row—just don't forget to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the correct word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words and don't forget letters can repeat too (eg: BOOKS).

    "title": "UK to dramatically increase weapons production",
    "article_text": "The UK will invest £1.5 billion ($2 billion) in new weapons factories as part of a sweeping rearmament strategy, Defense Secretary John Healey has announced. The move comes ahead of the publication of the government’s Strategic Defense Review on Monday. The plan includes the construction of at least six new munitions and explosives factories and the procurement of more than 7,000 domestically produced long-range weapons, including drones and missiles. Healey has also pledged to raise defence spending to 3% of GDP by 2034. “The hard-fought lessons from [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine show a military is only as strong as the industry that stands behind it,”Healey said in a statement on Saturday. “We are strengthening the UK’s industrial base to better deter our adversaries and make the UK secure at home and strong abroad.” The conflict in Ukraine has highlighted significant shortfalls in Western arms production. Senior British officers have warned for months about depleted stockpiles, according to the BBC. Opposition politicians questioned the timing of the announcement, pointing out that procurement had stalled over the past year. “We welcome investment in new munitions factories, but we don’t know when they will be ready – only that these orders should have been placed months ago,”said Conservative shadow defense secretary James Cartlidge. The UK has been one of Ukraine’s staunchest backers in its conflict with Russia, as NATO members in Europe seek to boost military support amid concerns that the US under President Donald Trump may scale back aid to Kiev. Moscow has repeatedly warned that foreign military assistance would only escalate the conflict without altering its eventual outcome. Russian officials have also accused former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson of encouraging Ukraine to abandon peace negotiations in the spring of 2022 – a claim Johnson has denied. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov dismissed his denial as a“blatant lie.”",

    "article_text": "Drawing parallels between Taiwan and the Ukraine conflict is“unacceptible,”the Chinese Embassy in Singapore said in response to remarks by French President Emmanuel Macron. “Comparing the Taiwan question with the Ukraine issue is unacceptable. The two are different in nature, and not comparable at all,”the embassy said on Facebook on Saturday, reiterating that the issue of Taiwan is“entirely China’s internal affair.” The statement was released shortly after Macron delivered a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore on Friday.“If we consider that Russia could be allowed to take a part of the territory of Ukraine without any restriction… What could happen in Taiwan?”he said. Crimea voted to join Russia shortly after the 2014 US-backed coup in Kiev, and four other former Ukrainian regions did the same following referendums in 2022. Moscow has demanded that, for a viable peace deal, Ukraine must recognize Russia’s new borders and withdraw its troops from Russian territory. Taiwan has had a separate government since 1949, when nationalists retreated to the island after losing a war with the Communists in mainland China. Beijing maintains that it will achieve“national reunification”and has warned the authorities in Taipei against formally declaring independence. Only a handful of countries recognize Taiwan as an independent country, while most states, including the US and Russia, adhere to the ‘One-China’ principle. Nevertheless, multiple Western countries maintain informal ties with Taiwan.",

    "title": "Israel confirms killing new Hamas chief",
    "article_text": "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has officially confirmed the killing of Hamas leader Muhammad Sinwar during an airstrike conducted earlier this month in the southern Gazan city of Khan Younis. Sinwar took over Hamas after the IDF killed his brother Yahya Sinwar and senior commander Muhammad Deif in October. The announcement comes as both sides reportedly signalled the willingness to accept a US-brokered ceasefire proposal. According to an IDF statement released on Saturday, the strike was carried out on May 13 in coordination with security service Shin Bet. The army said the target was an underground command center operated by Hamas beneath the European Hospital. “We eliminated the Head of Hamas, again. He happens to be a Sinwar too,”the IDF wrote on X. “The terrorists were eliminated while operating in an underground command and control center, under the European Hospital in Khan Younis, deliberately endangering the civilian population in and around the hospital,”the IDF said. The IDF said Sinwar played a“significant role in planning and executing the brutal October 7 massacre.” Also killed in the operation were Muhammad Shabana, commander of Hamas’s Rafah Brigade, and Mehdi Kuwara, head of the organization’s Khan Younis battalion. The IDF identified both as key operatives in the October 7 attack and holding Israeli hostages. Hamas has neither confirmed nor denied Sinwar’s death. The militant group previously denied the accusations of using civilian infrastructure as cover. Gazan health officials said at the time that 28 people were killed in the May 13 strike. The strike was reported as Israel stepped up its operations in Gaza, following the collapse of the internationally brokered ceasefire in March. While reports suggest that both Israel and Hamas have agreed in principle to a new ceasefire framework, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has maintained that military operations will continue until Hamas is fully eliminated. Following the hospital strike, he vowed to“go in with full force to complete the operation and free the remaining hostages.”",

    "article_text": "World World A view shows a damaged bus and a train carriage at the scene, after a road bridge collapsed onto railway tracks in the Bryansk region, Russia, in this image released Jun 1, 2025. (Photo: Moscow Interregional Transport Prosecutor's Office/Handout via REUTERS) At least seven people were killed and 69 injured when a highway bridge collapsed onto railway tracks after an \"illegal interference,\" derailing a train in Russia's Bryansk region that borders Ukraine, Russian authorities said early on Sunday. The train's locomotive and several cars derailed \"due to the collapse of a span structure of the road bridge as a result of an illegal interference in the operation of transport,\" Russian Railways said on the Telegram messaging app. Alexander Bogomaz, the governor of the Bryansk region, said on Telegram that 44 people were hospitalised. Three children were among those injured with one in serious condition, he added. Russia's ministry of emergency situations said on Telegram that efforts to find and rescue victims continued throughout the night, and that some 180 personnel were involved in the operation. Among those killed was the locomotive driver, Russia's state news agencies reported, citing medics. Social media pictures and videos showed passengers trying to help others climb out of the train's damaged carriages in the dark and firefighters looking for ways to reach passengers. Russia's Baza Telegram channel, which often publishes information from sources in the security services and law enforcement, reported, without providing evidence, that, according to preliminary information, the bridge was blown up. Reuters could not independently verify the Baza report. There was no immediate comment from Ukraine. Since the start of the war that Russia launched more than three years ago, there have been continued cross-border shelling, drone strikes, and covert raids from Ukraine into the Bryansk, Kursk and Belgorod regions that border Ukraine. The train was going from the town of Klimovo to Moscow, Russian Railways said. It collided with the collapsed bridge in the area of a federal highway in the Vygonichskyi district of the Bryansk region, Bogomaz said. The district lies around 100km (62 miles) from the border with Ukraine. US President Donald Trump has urged Moscow and Kyiv to work together on a deal to end the war, and Russia has proposed a second round of face-to-face talks with Ukrainian officials next week in Istanbul. Ukraine is yet to commit to attending the talks on Monday, saying it first needed to see Russian proposals, while a leading U.S. senator warned Moscow it would be \"hit hard\" by new US sanctions.

PSG stormed to a 5-0 thumping of Inter Milan in a one-sided final in Munich and after seeing their team lift the cup, large numbers of fans behind the goal streamed onto the pitch, with stewards struggling to maintain order. Police formed a cordon to keep them from going any further than the penalty area, much as PSG had done with Inter for much of the night during the game in an utterly dominant display.

The competition sought to uncover budding talent, serving as a launchpad for their future careers in the entertainment industry, like what similar contests did for past winners and radio DJs Ann Nicole, Kimberly Wang and Chew herself. In the finale held live at 313@Somerset on Saturday, the top four finalists competed in a series of challenges designed to bring out their stage presence, vocal prowess, spontaneity and charisma. For example, in the Wheel Of Flavours challenge, each contestant spun a wheel featuring eight Fisherman's Friend flavours. Each flavour unlocked a \"would you rather\" question, challenging finalists to respond with creativity, humour and confidence. In another challenge testing their hosting skills – from witty introductions to compelling conversations and rapport-building – each contestant was tasked to interview local musicians WhyLucas and Shazza live, demonstrating their ability to connect with both the artistes and audience. Judging the series of challenges were local personality SGAG's Xiao Ming, Mediacorp's Chief Talent Officer Doreen Neo, Mediacorp Class 95's Muttons - Justin Ang and Vernon A, and Mediacorp 987's Programme Director Janice Lim. Contestants were evaluated based on their \"vocal delivery, creativity, originality and audience engagement\", said Mediacorp in a media release on Saturday night. \"After careful deliberation, the judges awarded the title of Mediacorp 987 STAR 2025 to Georgina for her authenticity and poise.\" Mediacorp's head of growth and audio, Simone Lum, congratulated Dobson for \"a truly standout performance that embodied what Mediacorp 987 STAR is all about – creativity, authenticity, and strong audience connection\". \"We’re also incredibly proud of all our finalists – each of them brought something special to this competition, and it’s been a joy to witness their growth over the course of this journey.

    "title": "With 'Mountainhead,' Jesse Armstrong Out-Successions 'Succession': “How Far Can I Push This?”",
    "article_text": "Jesse Armstrongdoesn’t believe in evil—he thinks. “I think everyone behaves like they do for reasons which you could eventually get to the bottom of,” the prolific writer and producer says. For four deliciously diabolical seasons, Armstrong tested his theory by exploring the machinations and inner psyches of the at least evil-adjacent Roy family onSuccession. Hisnew HBO filmMountainhead,which premiered May 31, explores it once again, this time with tech-bro autocrats. Steve Carell,Ramy Youssef,Cory Michael Smith,andJason Schwartzmanplay Randall, Jeff, Venis (pronounced like “Venice,” not “Venus”), and Hugo—all massively successful tech entrepreneurs, all worth more than a billion dollars. (Except mere hundred-thousandaire Hugo, whom the others call “Souper,” short for “Soup Kitchen.”) While they gather for a boys weekend, the world outside Hugo’s palatial estate is quite literally falling apart. Governments are collapsing, stocks are crashing, and scores and scores of people are dying—all because of unregulated AI technology that Venis is directly responsible for unleashing into the world. Believe it or not,Mountainheadis Armstrong’s major directorial debut. Although he took home four Emmys for writing and creatingSuccession, Armstrong never directed an episode of the series—though he did consider it. “It’s impossible time-wise to do the writing I needed to do and also direct one,” Armstrong says. He also had a slight dose of imposter syndrome. “Mark Mylodhad been such a close collaborator and a valued one, and he often did the finales,” he says. To propose himself as a director “felt kind of presumptuous and rude; I worried I wouldn’t do as good a job as he would.” ForMountainhead, he put his fears aside. “I know the tone, I know what I want to get. It’s not doingGame of Thrones. You have some helicopters, but not even that many helicopters,” he says. Maybe he’d have had more if the film hadn’t been made so quickly. Armstrong pitched the film to HBO presidentCasey Bloysin December; he wrote the script in January, and they shot on location in March, editing as they went along before wrapping in early April. But Armstrong sees the truncated timeline as a blessing in disguise. “I was anxious about directing for the first time. Not having too much time to reconsider or worry actually felt like kind of an advantage,” he says. “I wasn’t going to read so many interviews with great directors. I wasn’t going to get paralyzed.” Cory Michael Smith, Steve Carell, Ramy Youssef, and Jason Schwartzman inMountainhead. On the surface, Randall, Jeff, Venis, and Souper seem similar—exorbitantly wealthy (mostly) white, (seemingly) straight men who’ve miraculously made it to the top of their fields. But Armstrong knows that not all tech entrepreneurs are built alike—even if they use the same jargon and wear the same fleeces. “Everybody’s different,” he says. “On a dumb writing level, you’ve got the dad, the favorite son, the usurper who’s going to take his position, and the guy who’s just clinging on by fingernails. You’ve got these archetypes.” Of course, it’s more complicated than that. And though each character brings real-world parallels to mind, none is a perfect fit for any one notorious tech bro. Carell’s venture capitalist, Randall, evokes bothPeter Thiel,the billionaire who once expressed interest in a practice involving the transfusion of blood from a younger person as a means of improving health and potentially reversing aging, andBryan Johnson, the biohacker whose commitment to slowing down the aging process has led him to comparehis nighttime erections with those of his teenage son. Youseff’s Jeff brings to mindSam Bankman-Fried—the young gun crypto king servinga 25-year sentenceafter being convicted onseven counts related to fraud and money laundering—and Open AI founderSam Altman,though he’s also positioned as the most moral billionaire. Cory Michael Smith’s Venis, the richest and most amoral of all, is an amalgam of Meta’s geek turned hypebeastMark Zuckerberg,andElon Musk.Souper? Well, he’s just Souper. “Because I wasn’t making a biographical or documentary representation of this world, I could just take a bit of, like, ‘Oh, that was weird when Sam Bankman-Fried said that,’” Armstrong says. “It was weird when Sam Altman said that, andMarc Andreessenseems to have a real big hang-up about this.” Some tech personalities gave him more material than others. “Obviously, Elon is so big in all of our minds at the moment. There’s a lot of him scattered around the different people. And Zuck as well. You could take different parts of their characters and sequestrate them away and create these amalgams that seem to work.” While the characters had ties to real people, the actors didn’t necessarily use them as a guide. Smith was inspired by Venis’s frenetic vibe: “The kinetic energy seemed really important,” he says. Youssef channeled his “dipshit-iest 14-year-old self, who was annoying and arrogant, but also always on the verge of tears. The first thing I said to Jesse was, ‘Well, this guy really reminds me of me when I was younger.’ Parts of me that are probably there, but I’ve dealt with more. But what would it look like if I didn’t? And what if this guy was just kind of out in the open?” In some ways, being the runt of the litter gives Souper an advantage. “Socially, he’s the most well-adjusted,” Schwartzman says. “You could put Souper in a restaurant or a bar, and he would be quite happy. Whereas the other guys, they’re a little more cut off or stilted.” But being closest to the common man comes at a cost. “He’s the one guy who hasn’t got the unicorn, as they say. And so I think behind that is a deep…not insecurity, but, like, ‘Am I not as cool as you guys?,’” Schwartzman says. “In many ways, how much money you have is your IQ. It literally is currency. It’s, like, ‘Am I really less than you all because I haven’t achieved what you’ve achieved?’\" “I just chose the best people,” Armstrong says. “They’re four really very decent and delightful human beings, and they were very generous to me as a first-time director.” To get the performances he wanted, Armstrong had a singular, simple guiding principle: no bullshit. “If you don’t know, don’t pretend. I think that’s the one thing that all fellow professionals, but maybe especially actors, smell out. If you try and be honest about what you do know and what you don’t know, I think you’re in a decent place. That was my credo.” Schwartzman, Youssef, and Carell inMountainhead. Mountainhead, and its characters, take a surprising turn halfway through the film. The world is falling apart, due to fake news generated on Venis’s social media platform; tensions rise between Venis and Jeff, who rejects Venis’s bid to buy his deep-fake-sniffing AI regulatory technology. So Venis and Randall make the rational, utilitarian decision to murder Jeff. Souper’s also buying in…sort of. “I think Super is not totally on board with it,” Schwartzman says. “But I think that he absolutely will kill him. He’ll do it because the other guys are doing it.” While that left turn might seem like a bridge too far even for Armstrong’s heightened reality,Mountainheadmakes it believable. “‘Too much’? That’s just doing my job, which is: What feels real?” Armstrong says. “How far can I push this a little bit beyond real, into the space of a satirical approach?” And Armstrong’s approach always keeps you on your toes. Venis, Randall, and Souper attempt to murder Jeff in multiple ways: nearly pushing him down a stairwell, trying to suffocate him with a pillow, dropping a bowling ball on him, and, last but not least, locking him in a sauna, filling it with gas, and threatening to light the sauna on fire. Yet Jeff manages to survive the night and confronts Venis the next day, where—in the final twist of the movie—the two tech bros laugh off the night before, make a deal that cuts Randall out of the picture, and hug it out. “I actually think [Venis] is his best friend,” Youssef says, explaining that final beat. “I don’t think that they have other relationships in their lives that go deeper. The fact that they’re calling themselves friends and it seems so duplicitous is actually a reflection of just how shallow their inner life really is. I think that they’re not faking it. It’s just they’re only doing what they’re capable of. It’s kind of sad.” For Smith, the attempted-murder-to-business-partner pipeline has historical roots. “It’s like medieval sword fighting,” he says. “You’re, like, best friend knights. But if you aren’t good enough,” the reaction can be harsh: “‘I’m sorry that you’re not a good enough fighter to play the game.’” Youssef likens it to boxing. “It’s like we’re in the ring,” he says. “We’re the most powerful people, and we’re duking it out.” Although the group turns on Jeff in the movie, all four actors were very connected on set. “When we would rehearse the scenes, we always seem to move as a unit,” Schwartzman says. A self-proclaimed “evangelist” for Schwartzman’s band Phantom Planet, Youssef would often blast Schwartzman’s music on the way to early morning shoots. “High school me would lose his mind to know that he was working with Jason and Steve,” Youssef says. “And he would also go, ‘who’s Cory?’” “I’d also say that,” Smith replies. Carell and Youssef inMountainhead. Trying to murder your best friend is, at the very least,slightlyevil. But Armstrong still doesn’t think all the technocrats running our world into the ground are doing bad things intentionally. “[It’s] more of an onion: layers of self-deception, dreams of decency and goodness, and base desires to be liked, have money, do what he wants,” he says. “Even someone like Peter Thiel.” But finding the humanity in these characters is different than humanizing them—at least according to Youssef. To him, Armstrong’s “goal is definitely not to humanize these billionaires and make you feel for them.” Smith tends to agree. “One of the most interesting things intellectually about this is observing the people that we put in power,” he says. “Who we put in power because of their wealth, because of the technology that they’ve developed and built. And how entire countries—our country—are reliant on this technology. These people have so much power, and who are they? They are unelected. What are we going to do about that as a greater common citizenry?” Youssef has another way of putting it. Everyone in theMountainheadsquad lives with an enormous amount of cognitive dissonance—“but we all have this. Almost everybody lives 15 minutes away from people who are suffering. We shut that part of our brain off and go get an $8 coffee. We are constantly doing this thing as we flicker through our social media, where we are scrolling past suffering, and then looking at fashion. We are constantly turning off parts of ourselves in order to just kind of be where we are.” Mountainhead’smeant to be entertaining, but it also sheds some light on that darker aspect of the human psyche. “I think most people who are watching something on HBO are going to relate to that,” he adds. “And I think that should scare you.” The Dizzying Rise of MAHA WarriorCalley Means, RFK Jr.’s Right-Hand Man The UnsinkableKathy Bates From RFK Jr. to Patrick Schwarzenegger, a Brief Guide tothe Kennedy Family Why Is Trump Pardoning  thisReality TV CoupleConvicted of Fraud?

    "article_text": "Elan Carr, CEO of the Israeli-American Council, spoke with Fox News Digital about the terror attack on Sunday in Boulder, Colorado. An Egyptian national who came into the country two years ago and overstayed his visa has been charged in the gruesome terror attack that left six people injured inBoulder, Colorado,Saturday, authorities said. Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was arrested at the scene, after he allegedly set his victims on fire as they peacefully rallied on behalf of Israeli hostages still being held by Hamas in Gaza. Soliman was heard yelling \"Free Palestine\" and other anti-Israel slogans during the attack on victims ranging in age from 67 to 88. Online records show Soliman has been booked into the Boulder County Jail. The shocking violence unfolded at 1:26 p.m. local time, when Boulder police were called to the county courthouse on Pearl Street for reports of a man who had a weapon and was setting people on fire, according to Boulder Police Chief Steve Redfearn. The attack took place near an event put on by \"Run for Their Lives,\" a grassroots group that organizes run and walk events calling for the release ofIsraeli hostagesheld since Oct. 7, 2023, according to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). SHOOTING AT CAPITAL JEWISH MUSEUM HIGHLIGHTS RISING WAVE OF ANTI-JEWISH HATE CRIMES Boulder police taped off an area near the crime scene.(KDVR) \"Run for Their Lives is an apolitical global organization with the sole mission of walking peacefully to raise awareness for the 58 hostages still held in captivity by Hamas in Gaza,\" the group said in a statement to Fox News Digital. Run for Their Lives said it has been holding events every week since Oct. 15, 2023 \"without any violent incidents until today.\" It called the plight of the remaining hostages an \"international humanitarian crisis\" and said there is a \"collective responsibility to release them all.\" \"We call on world leaders to do everything they can to ensure the swift return home of each of the 58 hostages. Run for Their Lives remains committed to our mission until ALL the HOSTAGES are returned back home!\" the organization said. The suspect was heard yelling, \"How many children you killed?\" and \"We have to end Zionists, they are killers,\" according to an analysis of video of the scene by the ADL Center on Extremism. Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said the attack, which happened on the eve of Shavuot, appears to have been motivated by hate. \"From what we know, this attack appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted,\" Weiser wrote in a statement. \"People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences. FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said the attack is being investigated as an act of \"ideologically motivated violence,\" based on early information, evidence and witness accounts. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard confirmed the National Counterterrorism Center is working with the FBI and local law enforcement on the ground. Later Sunday, FBI Denver said agents were at a location in El Paso County, Colorado conducting \"court-authorized law enforcement activity.\" Law enforcement officials dress up in protective gear to investigative an attack on the Pearl Street Mall, Sunday in Boulder, Colo.(AP) Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) sources told Fox News Soliman is in the country illegally as a visa over-stay, who came in during theBiden administration. He allegedly flew into the U.S. on Aug. 27, 2022, arriving at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) on a B1/B2 non-immigrant visa. Soliman was authorized to stay through Feb. 26, 2023, but never left, according to officials. On Sept. 29, 2022, he filed a claim, possibly for asylum. On March 29, 2023, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), under the Biden administration, gave him work authorization, which was valid through March of this year. Police initially evacuated three surrounding blocks and later expanded the evacuation area. Redfearn said Sunday evening that the area was not safe yet, as they are investigating a \"vehicle of interest.\" UN CASH APP FOR GAZANS EXPLOITED BY HAMAS AS TERROR GROUP STEALS AID MONEY MEANT FOR CIVILIANS Colorado Gov. Jared Polis in a statement described the attack as a\"heinous act of terror.\" \"I am closely monitoring the situation in Boulder, and my thoughts go out to the people who have been injured and impacted by this heinous act of terror,\" Polis wrote. \"Hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable. While details emerge, the state works with local and federal law enforcement to support this investigation.\" Weiser and Polis were the first two Jewish men elected to statewide office in Colorado in 2018. Secretary of State Marco Rubio,in a post to X, said \"terror has no place in our great country.\" Israel's Ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, saidterrorism against Jews\"does not stop at the Gaza border – it is already burning the streets of America.\" \"Today, in Boulder, Colorado, Jewish people marched with a moral and humane demand: to return the hostages,\" Danon wrote in a statement. \"In response, the Jewish protesters were brutally attacked, with an attacker throwing a Molotov cocktails at them.

It is time for concrete action to be taken against the instigators wherever they may be.\" The number of people injured in the Boulder, Colorado attack has not yet been released.(KDVR) Colorado Rep. Joe Neguse added he is \"praying hard for the victims.\" \"The scourge of anti-semitism has metastasized across our country,\" Neguse wrote on X. \"We must do more—now—to stop this violence.

    "title": "US can’t cut China off completely, but must defend AI and American innovation from nonstop theft: Sen Rounds",
    "article_text": "Republican South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds spoke to Fox News Digital about the U.S.’ efforts to remain the world’s economic and military leader as China makes technological advances. SIMI VALLEY, CALIFORNIA –China's rampanttheft of intellectual property from American institutions and industry must be thwarted as the U.S. battles to remain the world's economic and military leader – but America cannot completely decouple from the economic behemoth, Republican South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview. The key, according to Rounds, is maintaining China as a key trade partner without giving them access to America's technology, including artificial intelligence and computer chips. \"In doing so, maybe we'll restrict their ability to actually be able to have a market that they can create their own stuff with. They'll be using ours. And in using ours, they'll be our standards,\" Rounds told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview from the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library during the Reagan National Economic Forum on Friday in California. \"Let's not necessarily just totally divest. Let's see if we can have an influence on them and the rest of the world as well when it comes to standards forAI and other technological advancesin the future,\" he added. Rounds was among the conference panelists who spoke on the threats China poses as President Donald Trump addresses the country's chronic trade deficit with foreign nations, and his optimism for the future as the U.S. sprints to remain the world's economic and military leader. SPY SURGE SPARKS TRUMP VISA CRACKDOWN ON CHINESE STUDENTS South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds was a panelist for the inaugural Reagan National Economic Forum in California.(Getty Images) Rounds' remarks focused on keeping the U.S. in the driver's seat of the world's economy, which he explained is deeply entwined in technological advances and bucking Chinese theft of intellectual property, while also acknowledging and combating how China has advanced into a \"near-peer competitor\" with the U.S. from a military standpoint. 'NO REASON' FOR NEW NUKES: TRUMP FLOATS DISARMAMENT TALKS WITH CHINA, RUSSIA \"We've got to do a better job ofprotecting the intellectual propertiesthat we've got. The most advanced types of technologies that we have, everything we can do to slow down their connection with that, protecting against that infiltration or de-filtration of really good information that, right now, they're stealing from us on a regular basis,\" Rounds said during a panel called \"China and the U.S.: When Trading Partners are also Great Power Competitors.\" The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California.(Fox News Digital ) He added that China has no qualms about stealing U.S. intellectual property – which is understood as intangible creations, such as patents for inventions or trade secrets such as tech algorithms. Rounds recalled a recent conversation with an ambassador to China who told him their culture does not understand \"how someone can own an idea.\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced last Wednesday that the U.S. will begin \"aggressively\" revoking visas of Chinese students, most notably those with ties to the Chinese Communist Party who are trained at U.S. schools, but return to China or feed U.S. information to China. China has stolen billions in intellectual property on an annual basis, Sen. Mike Rounds says.(Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Rounds said the country needed a pause on admitting Chinese nationals with CCP ties into elite U.S. schools until an enforceable agreement is in place protecting intellectual property and processes from Chinese capture. \"We have Chinese students that come in here, and then they [maintain] ties back home. And even if they want to stay here, one of the challenges we have is that their family may very well be coerced into requiring them to come back home again. And if that's the case, any of the knowledge that we've helped them to develop here goes back home with them,\" Rounds said. \"Until such time as we're able to address that, and until such time as we're able to be assured that the information that they're getting here, the data that they are catching here, the knowledge that they gain here isn't going to be used against our young men and women in the future, we want to slow this down a little bit. Let's just take a break. Let's not be bringing in these Chinese students that have ties with the Chinese Communist Party, until we have some kind of agreement in place that is enforceable,\" he said. South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds was a panelist for the inaugural Reagan National Economic Forum in California.(Fox News Digital ) Rounds explained during the Reagan library forum that protecting U.S. intellectual property from Chinese theft has a ripple effect on U.S. efforts to remain the world's military leader as China seeks parity with America. STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS IT WILL ‘AGGRESSIVELY REVOKE’ VISAS OF CHINESE STUDENTS \"[China is] a strategic challenger for us on the military side. They are a near-peer competitor. And they have an advantage over us in one particular way: They are unified in terms of when Xi Jinping wants to move, it's not just the government that moves, but the entire rest of their economic activity is required to move the way that he wants them to move. We don't have that here. And so for us, we have to recognize that challenge. Now, I'm not suggesting we go the direction that they go, but we have to recognize their ability to move very, very quickly,\" he said. Chinese President Xi Jinping listens during a meeting in Hanoi, Vietnam, on April 14.(AP/Minh Hoang) The Trump administration leveled tariffs as high as 145% on Chinese goods in April, and China retaliated against the president's \"Liberation Day\" policies with tariffs of its own. China and the U.S. reached a preliminary trade agreement last month, which Trump said China violated in a Truth Social post on Friday. TRUMP CALLS OUT PUTIN, ACCUSES CHINA OF NOT HONORING TRADE DEAL TERMS DURING 19TH WEEK IN OFFICE \"I made a FAST DEAL with China in order to save them from what I thought was going to be a very bad situation, and I didn’t want to see that happen. Because of this deal, everything quickly stabilized and China got back to business as usual. Everybody was happy! That is the good news!!! The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!\" he wrote. President Donald Trump speaks during the National Prayer Breakfast, Feb. 6, 2025, in Washington, D.C.(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Rounds explained that the U.S. is in the midst of reaching a favorable trade deal while also acknowledging China has stolen billions of dollars in intellectual property for its own advantage. \"We do, right now, really close to about a half a trillion dollars a year in economic activity with China today, but they steal about $600 billion in intellectual property on an annual basis. And so we have this dichotomy of trying to do good trade and at the same time recognizing that they're stealing our property,\" he said. Rounds said the floodgates of accepting and leveraging AI have not yet opened in the U.S., as many Americans are still hesitant to trust the technology. In mere months and years, however, he said the health industry will see massive overhauls, aided by tech that can quickly identify cancer or diagnose diabetes and Alzheimer's. This will lead American culture to accept AI and rally the private sector's proliferation of it, he said. HOUSE CHINA COMMITTEE ZEROS IN ON LATEST CCP EFFORTS TO STEAL AMERICAN AGRICULTURE IP \"I think what the American people want to see is, what's in it for them? What improves their quality of life? I think one of the most critical issues – that would really be one of the easiest to get into – is talking about health care. And I firmly believe that Americans will see AI as a benefit to them rather than as a challenge when we start to see cures for diabetes, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and cancers. And those are all within reach,\" Rounds told Fox Digital. Rounds added during the forum that when Americans personally feel how their quality of life has improved due to AI,\"that's when we'll really see the push across the country to develop AI at a rate that you've never seen before by the private sector, as well.\" \"That's what's going to keep us ahead of China,\" he said.

    "title": "Variety report claims 'The Boys' and 'Handmaid's Tale' imaginary fascist worlds are becoming reality",
    "article_text": "Actor Jon Voight says President Donald Trump wants to see film industry \"thrive.\" Michael Schneider, executive editor for Variety's TV section, claimed in an article published Friday that the imaginary fascist worlds of Amazon Prime's \"The Boys\" and Hulu's \"The Handmaid's Tale\" are becoming reality. Schneider argued the fictitious worlds created in the TV series \"don’t seem so far-fetched anymore\" in PresidentDonald Trump's America. \"The Boys,\" a TV series based on a group of superheroes who cause more chaos than they do good, recently rolled out a marketing campaign jokingly referring to the show as a documentary. In a2022 interview with Rolling Stone, showrunner Eric Kripke confirmed the series' \"evil-Superman-style character,\" Homelander, was created as a \"direct Trump analogue.\" The Variety editor wrotethat the superhero series \"feels a lot less fictional every season it’s on the air.\" 'HANDMAID'S TALE' SHOWRUNNERS SAY THEIR SERIES' 'WARNING' WAS 'IGNORED' BASED ON TRUMP'S RE-ELECTION Schneider argued that the terrifying events portrayed in \"The Handmaid's Tale\" no longer \"seem so far-fetched anymore.\" \"That’s why the cheeky ‘The Boys’ ads tout its campaign for ‘Best Documentary Series.’\" he wrote. \"Sure, the ‘documentary’ is crossed out, and ‘drama’ is hastily written above it, like it was a last-minute mistake. But we’ve been making that joke for years.\" Schneider then shifted his focus to \"The Handmaid's Tale,\" claiming the frightening events that take place in the series \"don't seem so far-fetched anymore.\" He featured quotes from the show's creators to reinforce his point that the authoritarian dystopia featured in the series is now becoming reality. The show's executive producer, Eric Tuchman, recalled that some writers for the show were concerned about the possibility of Roe v. Wade being overturned when Trump won the presidency in 2016. He felt that it sounded \"kind of alarmist and extremist … I could not have been more wrong, obviously.\" Tuchman claimed the show's creators weren't focused on calling attention to \"the political situation in the country,\" but said \"it was just uncanny how much it ended up being a mirror of what was happening in the real world.\" Another showrunner, Yahlin Chang, said before she joined the production, she \"did all this research into what happens when parents and children are separated in conflict zones.\" She conducted this research in preparation for a scene in which one of the characters is allowed to visit her estranged daughter for only 10 minutes under government supervision. AMERICA NOW WORSE THAN 'MAKE BELIEVE' 'HANDMAID'S TALE' BECAUSE OF ABORTION, ACTRESS CLAIMS \"The Handmaid's Tale\" costumes have become popular among pro-abortion protesters following the overturning of Roe v. Wade.(REUTERS/Leah Millis) \"My research focused on conflict zones like Liberia, Cambodia, Bosnia. I never imagined that that would happen in our own country. But by the time I wrote this scene in 2017, and by the time it aired in 2018, it aired the week that we were separating parents and children at the border,\" Chang said. She claimed \"by doing research on what authoritarian regimes do,\" the show's creators \"somehow predicted what would happen\" in the real world. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Schneider noted that, \"Ironically, just as things get even worse here in theUnited States,\" the imaginary land of Gilead in the series is poised for a revolution. In closing, the Variety editor left readers with his hopes for the future. \"A revolution and a happy ending for 'The Handmaid’s Tale?' Here’s hoping the real world can imitate art in this way, too,\" Schneider concluded. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

This change comes at a time when Syria and Israel are engaged in direct talks as Reuters revealed on Tuesday, marking a dramatic departure from the decades-long hostility between the two nations. Reuters reported, Israel and Syria have recently held direct meetings focused on security issues along their shared border. These talks represent a major step in the relationship between the two countries, which have been adversaries for decades.

The discussions come after a shift in U.S. policy, following PresidentDonald Trump’smeeting with Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa earlier this month. The meeting signaled a break from decades of U.S. hostility toward Syria’s Assad regime and opened the door to potential normalization between Syria and Israel. While the talks are still in the early stages, Trump’s engagement has raised the possibility of Syria’s leadership eventually normalizing ties with Israel, although this process will likely take time. Furat Alali explained: \"We don’t want to be part of the Axis of Resistance anymore. The Palestinian cause has been used to oppress us. We feel sympathy for the Palestinians, but now we need to focus on Syria and our future.\" U.S. President Donald Trump meets with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in this handout released on May 14, 2025. Saudi Press Agency/Handout via Reuters. Lina Ali, a 24-year-old pharmacist from Latakia, told Fox News Digital, \"We feel for the people of Gaza. We condemn the mass killings, but we are in a different situation. We are thinking about our own interests now. The idea of exploiting the Palestinian cause to oppress the Syrian people has been rejected. We are tired of this.\" Another young woman interviewed by Jusoor News, a Pan-Arab media outlet, shared similar thoughts: \"We are for anything that serves our country’s interest. We’ve lived through difficult times. The country’s economy is very weak. It’s time for people to live.\" FALL OF SYRIA'S BASHAR ASSAD IS STRATEGIC BLOW TO IRAN AND RUSSIA, EXPERTS SAY An elderly Syrian man explained to Jusoor, \"We’ve spent 40-50 years preaching Arabism and liberating Palestine, and what do we have to show for it? Nothing. It’s time for peace.\" The shift in Syria’s stance on Israel is significant, especially given thehistorical enmitybetween the two nations. For decades, Syria and Israel have been locked in conflict, with the status of the Golan Heights remaining a key point of contention since its capture by Israel during the 1967 war. Syria’s involvement in the Axis of Resistance, aligning with Iran and Hezbollah against Israel, has been a cornerstone of its foreign policy. However, the recent emergence of interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa has raised new possibilities, as well as concerns. Furat Ali said, \"I was one of the journalists who extensively covered the violations of Jabhat al-Nusra before the fall of the Assad regime, the group Al-Jolani emerged from (using his previous name), which was part of al-Qaeda. I know exactly what they did. So, when I first heard that Al-Jolaniwas taking over Aleppoand challenging Assad, I was scared.\" The Syrian army sends reinforcements, including tanks, armored vehicles and rocket launchers, to Latakia and Tartus as search operations against the ousted regime forces expand following an attack on security forces in Latakia province of Syria on March 7, 2025.(Izettin Kasim/Anadolu via Getty Images) \"But as time went on,\" she added, \"when he rebranded himself as Ahmed al-Sharaa and promised a new direction, I saw he was smart. He managed to convince the West to lift sanctions and engage with him, bringing back international recognition for Syria. While we remain skeptical and cautious, what we’re seeing from Sharaa domestically is so far being accepted.\" Joseph Braude, founder and president of the Center for Peace Communications, highlighted the significance of the shift in public opinion within Syria. He noted, \"People in Syria and Lebanon often associate the Palestinian issue with dictators who exploited it to justify corruption and brutality. There is a growing rejection of pro-Palestinian militancy, as many people now desire to turn the page and focus on new partnerships aimed at developing their own countries. \"We believe that it has become a majority view in Syria that if peace with Israel brings economic development and improvements, then it’s worth pursuing.\" Syrians gather at Umayyad Square to celebrate the collapse of 61 years of Baath Party rule in Damascus, Syria on December 9, 2024.(Murat Sengul/Anadolu via Getty Images) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP He also pointed out that in countries dominated by Iran and its militias, ordinary people have the clearest understanding of the harm these groups cause. \"They are among the most eager for a different future, increasingly calling for peace,\" Braude added. As one man interviewed by Jusoor News put it: \"We’ve suffered years of oppression and war. It’s time for reconstruction. We need peace with everyone,\" another Syrian added’ \"I support normalization a million percent! If normalization with Israel, or America or whoever can bring us comfort, then I’m on board.

    "title": "UK humanitarian aid to Gaza scrutinized after document allegedly warns of links to Hamas-controlled ministry",
    "article_text": "Eylon Levy, a former Israeli government spokesperson, says Israel is in an ‘impossible bind’ as it tries to defeat Hamas and free remaining hostages in Gaza. A newly surfacedU.K. governmentdocument has raised fresh concerns over British-funded humanitarian aid to Gaza, suggesting officials were aware of the risk funds might indirectly support Hamas. the terrorist group that governs the Gaza Strip. While U.K. officials strongly deny the claim, critics say key questions remain unanswered. The document, dated November 2022 andobtained by NGO Monitor, outlines the U.K.'s humanitarian strategy in the occupied Palestinian territories. One section references a UNICEF-administered cash assistance program in Gaza coordinated with the Ministry of Social Development (MoSD). The NGO Monitor report claims, \"The MoSD in Gaza is affiliated with the de facto authorities and thus U.K. Aid can be linked directly or indirectly with supporting the de factoauthority in Gaza (Hamas), which is part of a proscribed group.\" UN CASH APP FOR GAZANS EXPLOITED BY HAMAS AS TERROR GROUP STEALS AID MONEY MEANT FOR CIVILIANS The IDF said 121 trucks of aid from \"the U.N. and the international community\" crossed into Gaza May 28, 2025.(IDF Spokesperson's Unit) The group's report also claimed the British consulate-general in Jerusalem, which reportedly authored the document, assessed this as a \"reputational\" risk, raising concerns not of legality, but of public perception if the arrangement were to be revealed. Anne Herzberg, legal advisor at NGO Monitor, told Fox News Digital the phrasing is significant. \"This is what was most shocking to us,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"The government clearly acknowledged the risk that U.K. taxpayer fundscould reach Hamas,but they were more concerned about how it might look than the real danger of supporting terrorism.\" Herzberg explained NGO Monitor uncovered the Foreign Office document, originally published in November 2022, during an extensive investigation into humanitarian aid flows in Gaza. Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer, left, and Foreign Secretary David Lammy at the British ambassador's residence in Washington Sept. 13, 2024, before a meeting with President Joe Biden.(Stefan Rousseau/Pool via AP) In a statement to Fox News Digital, the U.K.’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) categorically denied any funding reached Hamas-controlled bodies. \"We categorically reject these allegations. The U.K. does not fund Hamas-run agencies in Gaza,\" an FCDO spokesperson stated. \"TheUNICEF programis coordinated with the Ministry of Social Development in Ramallah, which is run by the Palestinian Authority. U.K. funding was provided through UNICEF directly to vulnerable households in Gaza.\" The FCDO stressed that Hamas is a proscribed terrorist organization under U.K. law, \"and funding or supporting it is a crime.\" It further noted that the U.K. conducted a due-diligence assessment of UNICEF and tracks the path of funding to its final civilian recipients. ISRAEL FIRES BACK AT UK OVER SUSPENDED TRADE TALKS, REJECTS ‘EXTERNAL PRESSURE’ But Herzberg said the November 2022 document — alongside UNICEF’s own March 2024 update celebrating its \"strengthened partnership with the Ministry of Social Development\" in Gaza — points to deeper inconsistencies. Yona Schiffmiller, the director of research at NGO Monitor, told Fox News digital, \"The U.K. document clearly refers to the Gaza-based MoSD. If the program was only coordinated with Ramallah, it’s unclear why Gaza-specific risks were flagged.\" A man holds a wad of Israeli shekels in Gaza.(Majdi Fathi/TPS) UNICEF’s March 2024 report states that over 540,000 Gazans received support after the Oct. 7 attacks, adding the partnership with the MoSD \"helped ensure access to the social registry and resulted in targeting the most vulnerable families.\" NGO Monitor points out that the MoSD in Gaza is led by Ghazi Hamad, a Hamas politburo member sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury in 2024. Herzberg said the report claims \"this aid diversion was central inHamas’ preparationsfor the October 7th massacre, including the construction of tunnels and other military installations, and stockpiling supplies and resources. After thousands of terrorists invaded Israel and committed mass atrocities, Hamas continued to commandeer aid, creating and taking advantage of a black market.\" ISRAELI AMBASSADOR LASHES OUT AT UN OFFICIAL, CONDEMNS UK, FRANCE, CANADA STATEMENT ON AID \"Even after Oct. 7 and all we’ve been seeing ... they still refuse to deal with this question of diversion,\" Herzberg claimed. \"There’s no transparency, no oversight, and the U.N. is actively trying to thwart Israeli, U.S. and other allied efforts in trying to improve the humanitarian aid situation.\" She was referring to the recent U.S.-backed initiative to establish a new aid distribution system in Gaza that started operating Monday. The NGO Monitor report further details how the MoSD is run by senior Hamas officials, including Ghazi Hamad, who publicly praised the Oct. 7 massacre and was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury in November 2024. Another top MoSD figure, Mohammed Al-Araeer, has repeatedly glorified terrorist attacks on social media and praised Hamas commanders. Hamas terrorists take up positions ahead of a hostage release in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza Strip, Feb. 8, 2025.(AP) A recent investigation by Israel’s website, \"Shomrim,\" andIsrael’s Channel 12revealed that Hamas has built an extensive fundraising network inside the U.K. Senior Hamas operatives with British citizenship have established charitable foundations that raise millions of pounds annually, some of which ends up in the hands of the group’s military wing. Udi Levi, formerly head of the Counter-Terror Financing Division in the Mossad, told Israel’s Channel 12, \"Britain is becoming the central country transferring funds to Hamas, including after Oct. 7.\" The watchdog also raised broader concerns about the role of other U.N. agencies in Gaza, noting at least 12 are active in the Strip. Herzberg said it remains unclear whether similar diversion risks exist across those agencies. \"We all know how UNRWA has been taken over by Hamas, but what about the others? Is the same thing happening there? These are the types of questions no one is willing to answer,\" she said.

Last month, the U.K. suspended trade negotiations with Israel, citing humanitarian concerns. Foreign Secretary David Lammy criticized the Israeli government’s actions in Gaza and called for restored aid and electricity. NGO Monitor says the debate highlights the urgent need for a new international mechanism to oversee aid delivery in Gaza, one that bypasses Hamas-controlled institutions and ensures civilian aid is protected from exploitation.

    "article_text": "Former Congresswoman Michelle Steel outlines the threats China poses in the Yellow Sea amid South Korea's presidential election. Early South Korean voters reportedly turned out in record numbers this week as the nation awaits the June 3 presidential election in what has been described as a pivotal race amid ongoing threats posed by China and recent rocky relations with the U.S. due to PresidentDonald Trump’stariffs. The leader of the progressive Democratic Party ofSouth Korea, Lee Jae-myung, is reported to be leading the race as the frontrunner, but he has raised some eyebrows after he vowed to take a \"pragmatic\" approach to geopolitics, chiefly by easing previously hawkish positions on China and lessening dependence on the U.S. \"The alliance with the U.S. is the foundation of South Korea’s diplomacy,\" Lee said during a debate earlier this month,Bloomberg reported.

We need to manage them appropriately, and there’s no need to have an unnecessarily hostile approach like now,\" Lee also said during the debate, theSouth China Morning Postreported. Former California GOP Congresswoman Michelle Steel, who was born in South Korea, explained that China's \"bullying\" behavior in the region leaves much for the global community to be concerned about. \"China [poses] the biggest threat, and they already told the whole world that they're going to take over Taiwan,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"When they take over, where are they going to go [to] next?

Lee’s chief challenger, Kim Moon-soo of the conservative People Power Party (PPP), a former labor minister under Yoon, pushed back on the democratic challenger’s position when it comes to China and the U.S. But Lee has rejected the idea he is not prioritizing the U.S. alliance and reportedly said during this month’s debate, \"There’s no need to worry. The South Korea-U.S. alliance is important and should continue to grow and strengthen.\" NORTH KOREA LAUNCHES SHORT-RANGE BALLISTIC MISSILES INTO SEA, SOUTH KOREA SAYS Though he did caution that certain steps taken by the Trump administration, including the25% tariffsannounced earlier this year and the potential withdrawal of troops has \"eroded\" the relationship. \"If the U.S. continues this way — eroding its soft power and the trust of other nations — it won’t be sustainable. At some point, brakes will be applied,\" Lee said. \"Until then, endurance is key.\" Steel argued the \"South Korean people understand the importance of a strong relationship with the United States.\" \"Whatever the outcome of the election, South Korean leaders should embrace President Trump and look to make an incredible trade deal that will benefit everyone,\" she added. But Lee has not convinced all who are weary of his view on U.S. relations, including David Eunkoo Kim, founder and president of the Truth Forum, a conservative youth organization founded at Seoul National University.

He has been implicated in sending funds to North Korea in violation of U.N. sanctions, and his deference to China has been nothing short of submissive,\" Kim said. Kim was referring to Lee's indictment for an illegal cash transfer scheme to North Korea, though Lee denies the accusations and has argued they arepolitically motivated.

    "article_text": "Conservatives slammed NJ Democratic Sen. Cory Booker for delivering an alleged \"Nazi salute\" just months after liberals and the media accused former DOGE leader Elon Musk of gesturing like a \"Nazi.\" Conservatives are mocking Sen.Cory Bookerfor delivering an alleged \"Nazi salute\" to California Democrats, while quipping the New Jersey Democrat won't get the same scrutiny Elon Musk did when he raised his arm to MAGA supporters in January. \"NEW: Democrat Senator Cory Booker appears to do a ‘Nazi’ salute in front of a large crowd of Democrats.

Booker traveled to the Los Angeles area on Saturday, where he addressed the California Democratic Party's convention, calling on supporters to \"stand up\" to President Donald Trump and repeating a handful of messages he delivered during his marathon 25-hour speech on the Senate floor in March railingagainst Musk, the Department of Government Efficiency, and the Trump administration for its alleged attacks on \"Americans' safety, financial stability, the core foundations of our democracy.\" ELON MUSK'S MOTHER URGES HIM TO SUE CNN, OTHER NEWS OUTLETS FOR PEDDLING 'NAZI SALUTE' NARRATIVE Sen.

It comes from the people who’s standing up and have shown over and over again – against the powerful, against the elected, against the rich – that the power of the people is greater than the people in power,\" Booker said on Saturday to the California Democrats. He capped off his roughly 15-minute speech with a gesture where he placed his right hand on his chest before raising it to the crowd. Musk delivered a similar gesture in January on Trump's inauguration day, which yielded dozens of headlines from mainstream media outlets that Musk delivered a \"Nazi-style salute\" to Trump supporters. Liberals and critics frequently attacked Trump while he was on the campaign trail by calling him a Hitler-esque fascist, including former Vice President Kamala Harris, who compared Trump to the German dictator during a town hall in October.

New Jersey voters will choose their Democrat andRepublican nomineesfor governor on June 10, closing out competitive primary contests that could have major implications for the Garden State. It's a crowded field on both sides of the aisle as six Democrats and five Republicans are vying for the chance to replace Democrat Gov.Phil Murphy, who is term-limited this year. Democratic candidates include Newark mayor Ras Baraka, Jersey City mayor Steve Fulop, New Jersey Education Association president Sean Spiller, former New Jersey Senate president Steve Sweeney and U.S. Reps. Josh Gottheimer and Mikie Sherill. 2021 Republican gubernatorial nominee Jack Ciattarelli, radio personality Bill Spadea, New Jersey state Sen.

REP. MIKIE SHERRILL SUGGESTS THIRD TRUMP IMPEACHMENT AS SHE CAMPAIGNS TO BE NEXT NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR New Jersey is one of just two gubernatorial elections in 2025, along with Virginia. Both races will be used by politicians and pundits to gauge how Americans are responding to Trump's second term ahead of the midterm elections next year. Trump outperformed in the Garden State in 2024, according toFox News Voter Analysis. While Vice PresidentKamala Harriswon New Jersey in 2024 as expected, Trump gained a nearly five-point improvement from his 2020 vote share and Harris' support dropped by about five points. He gained acrossNew Jersey, with his largest swings in the northeast corner of the state. Hudson and Passaic counties lead the pack.

Santiago/Getty Images) Trump held a large \"Make America Great Again\" rally on the Jersey Shore during his 2024 presidential campaign as he told the crowd that New Jersey was in play, despite its reputation as a reliable blue state. Republican gubernatorial candidates have been eager to play up their relationships with Trump and cast their campaigns as the most aligned with Trump. But the president endorsed Ciattarellion Truth Socialearlier this month – a blow to Ciatarelli's closest competitor, Spadea. Ciattarelli is leading the pack of Republican candidates with 42% of New Jersey registered Republicans and Republican-leaning independent voters, according to aRutgers-Eagleton/SSRS Garden State Panelpoll conducted from April 1 to April 10. Spadea comes in a distant second, with 12%. Four percent of Republicans said they preferred Bramnick, 3% chose Barbera, and no one chose Kranjac. Four percent say they don't prefer any of the candidates. Ciattarelli landed Trump's endorsement earlier this month.(Getty Images) This is the leading Republican's third consecutive gubernatorial bid. Ciattarellilost by a hairto Murphy in 2021 and has framed his candidacy as a referendum on the Democrat policies that have driven New Jersey for the past eight years. Meanwhile, the Democrat candidates have walked a fine line between building on Murphy's legacy and promising to change the status quo in Trenton. Like Murphy, Democrat candidates have rejected Trump's executive orders, crackdown on illegal immigration andDepartment of Government Efficiency(DOGE) cuts. The same poll found Democrats were more split about their leading candidate. 17% of registered Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents said they prefer Sherrill and 12% said they support Fulop, which is within the margin of error.

    "title": "Inside Jill Biden's political rise amid her husband's cognitive decline: Book",
    "article_text": "Fox News contributor Joe Concha discusses calls for Jill Biden to answer questions about the former president's mental decline while in office. Former PresidentJoe Biden's inner circle considers first lady Jill Biden one of the most powerful first ladies in history, CNN anchor Jake Tapper and Axios political correspondent Alex Thompson reveal in their new book, \"Original Sin.\" Jill Biden, who has a doctoral degree in education and whomWhite Housestaffers called \"Dr. B\" for short, was a reluctant political spouse in the early days of her husband's career. During his presidential campaigns and into his presidency, the first lady became his staunchest defender and a \"political partner in addition to a spouse,\" Thompson and Tapper wrote. \"Dr. B was a strong, protective force in the White House. She was also, without question, one of the chief supporters of the president's decision to run for reelection, and one of the chief deniers of his deterioration,\" the authors wrote. PresidentDonald Trump's White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Thursday that Jill Bidenshould have to answerfor her complicity in the \"cover-up\" of Biden's cognitive decline.

'INTENSELY LOYAL' JILL BIDEN AIDE DESPISED BY WHITE HOUSE STAFFERS, NEW BOOK CLAIMS As Biden's sister, Valerie \"Val\" Biden Owens, and his adult children, Hunter Biden and Ashley Biden, stayed away from Biden's 2020 presidential campaign, Jill Biden took on a more prominent role, the book revealed. \"She weighed in on potential hires and reviewed many of the campaign ads before they were aired. She campaigned hard and peppered aides with questions about how many reporters would be at her events,\" Tapper and Thompson said. Jill Biden sat for job interviews for White House aide candidates, and she \"kept score\" of which staffers were most loyal, with the help ofher most trusted aide, Anthony Bernal, the book revealed. The White House began referring to Jill Biden's \"spousal programming\" events on foreign trips, and her team would request talking points, which Tapper and Thompson said some national security officials found strange.

Caleb Boggs Federal Building on June 7, 2024, in Wilmington, Delaware.(Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) \"[Bernal] had already begun planning the first lady's 2025 international travel schedule,\" Tapper and Thompson said. The first lady made an off-hand comment to French President Emmanuel Macron at a state dinner in 2022 about the difficult nature of campaigns and how she needed to stay in shape. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's daughter, Alexandra, overheard and found it odd, according to \"Original Sin.\" \"Alexandra then turned to the president and asked if they should toast to another campaign. He looked back at her like he didn't understand. Alexandra thought her mom looked shocked. Everyone quickly gathered themselves. With Macron, they toasted to four more years,\" the authors said. Dr. B was particularly sensitive when asked about Biden's age and ability, according to the authors. After Biden's consequential debate performance in the summer of 2024,The Associated Pressreported that Jill and Hunter Biden were urging the president to continue his re-election campaign. Sources told AP the family \"questioned how he was prepared for the debate by staff and wondered if they could have done something better.\" President Joe Biden looks down during his debate with former President Donald Trump at CNN's studios in Atlanta on June 27, 2024.(AFP via Getty Images) \"Hunter privately talked about it as being the family against the world. People sensed a more manic quality in him post-debate. He was determined to save his dad,\" according to Tapper and Thompson. Soon after the debate, Jill Biden joined Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., on the campaign trail. After defending the president's re-election campaign to reporters, Stabenow brought up some of her colleagues' concerns about Biden continuing in the race. JILL BIDEN ACCUSED OF 'ELDER ABUSE' BY WASHINGTON POST COLUMNIST FOR PUSHING HUSBAND TO SEEK RE-ELECTION \"The First Lady didn't answer the senator's implied question, but she later fumed about it to White House staffers,\" the book alleged. A week later, Gov. Josh Shapiro, from the pivotalbattleground state of Pennsylvania,told the president, \"I have some concerns.\" However, before Biden could fully respond, the first lady was ushering him away. \"Jill fumed with resentment about all the Democrats who she considered friends now pushing Biden out. She knew she had blundered in the aftermath of the debate with her belittling praise. She was only trying to help her husband in his moment of need. In the end, she told Biden: ‘This is your decision. This is for you to decide,’\" according to the book.

    "title": "Senate Republicans eye changes to Trump's megabill after House win",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on senators pushing to revise the House-passed Trump spending bill as it heads to the Senate for debate. House Republicans eked out a win in May with their advancement of PresidentDonald Trump’s\"big, beautiful bill,\" filled with negotiations and compromises on thorny policy issues that barely passed muster in the lower chamber. Next week, Senate Republicans will get their turn to parse through the colossal package and are eying changes that could be a hard sell for House SpeakerMike Johnson, R-La., who can only afford to lose three votes. INSIDE THE LATE-NIGHT DRAMA THAT LED TO TRUMP'S TAX BILL PASSING BY 1 VOTE President Donald Trump listens to a question during an event to present law enforcement officers with an award in the Oval Office at the White House on May 19.(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) Congressional Republicans are in a dead sprint to get the megabill — filled with Trump’s policy desires on taxes, immigration, energy, defense and the national debt — onto the president’s desk by early July. Trump has thrown his support behind the current product, but said during a press conference in the Oval Office on Friday that he expected the package to be \"jiggered around a little bit.\" \"It's going to be negotiated with the Senate, with the House, but the end result is it extends the Trump tax cuts,\" he said. \"If it doesn't get approved, you'll have a 68% tax increase,\" the president continued. \"You're going to go up 68%. That's a number that nobody has ever heard of before. You'll have a massive tax increase.\" Senate Majority LeaderJohn Thune, R-S.D., has an identical margin to Johnson, and will need to cultivate support from a Senate GOP that wants to put its own fingerprints on the bill. Senators have signaled they’d like to make changes to a litany of House proposals, including reforms to Medicaid and the timeline for phasing out green energy tax credits, among others, and have grumbled about the hike to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap pushed for by moderate House Republicans. SCOOP: HOUSE GOP MEMO HIGHLIGHTS REPUBLICAN WINS IN TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' Senate Majority Leader John Thune speaks during a news conference following the Senate Republican policy luncheon at the U.S. Capitol on March 11.(Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Thune said many Republicans are largely in favor of the tax portion of the bill, which seeks to make Trump’s first-term tax policy permanent, and particularly the tax policies that are \"stimulative, that are pro-growth, that will create greater growth in the economy.\" Much of the debate, and prospective tweaks, from the upper chamber would likely focus on whether the House’s offering has deep enough spending cuts, he said. \"When it comes to the spending side of the equation, this is a unique moment in time and in history where we have the House and the Senate and the White House and an opportunity to do something meaningful about controlled government spending,\" Thune said. The House package set a benchmark of $1.5 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade. Some in the Senate GOP would like to see that number cranked up marginally to at least $2 trillion, largely because thetaxportion of the package is expected to add nearly $4 trillion to the deficit, according to recent findings from the Joint Committee on Taxation. \"There's just so many great things in this bill,\" Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., told Fox News Digital. \"The only thing I would like to do is try to cut the spending, and I would love to take a little bit from a lot of places, rather than a lot from just one place.\" SPEAKER JOHNSON CLASHES WITH RAND PAUL OVER ‘WIMPY’ SPENDING CUTS IN TRUMP'S BILL Sen. Ron Johnson talks with reporters in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., after the House passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on May 22.(CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) Others, like Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., want to see the cuts in the package return to pre-pandemic spending levels, which would amount to roughly a $6 trillion slash in spending. Johnson has remained unflinching in his opposition to the current bill, and warned that \"no amount of pressure\" from Trump could change his mind. \"President Trump made a bunch of promises,\" Johnson said at an event in Wisconsin on Wednesday. \"My promise has been, consistently, we have to stop mortgaging our children's future. OK, so I think there are enough [Republicans] to slow this process down until the president, our leadership, gets serious about returning to a pre-pandemic level.\" Others are concerned over the proposed slashes to Medicaid spending, which congressional Republicans have largely pitched as reform efforts designed to root out waste, fraud and abuse in the program used by millions of Americans. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The House package would see a roughly $700 billion cut from the program, according to a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), and some Senate Republicans have signaled that they wouldn't support the changes if benefits were cut for their constituents. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., warned in an op-ed for The New York Times last month that cutting benefits was \"both morally wrong and politically suicidal.\" Meanwhile, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, raised concerns about what proposed cuts to the program would do to rural hospitals in her state. \"I cannot support proposals that would create more duress for our hospitals and providers that are already teetering on the edge of insolvency,\" she said.

    "article_text": "The House Democratic campaign chair tells Fox News Digital her party is 'united' to win back the majority. With the early moves heating up in the 2026 battle for the House majority, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's (DCCC) chair argues PresidentDonald Trumpand the Republican majorities in the House and Senate are \"doing incredible damage to working families and to our country.\" And with the GOP defending a razor-thin majority in the House in next year's midterm elections, Rep. Suzan DelBene, theDCCC chair,noted, \"We only need three more seats.\" \"We have 35 districts in play across the country where we have opportunities,\" DelBene said in a Fox News Digital interview last week in the nation's capital, pointing to the Republican-held seats the DCCC is targeting. \"We are on offense. We are fighting for the American people and for the important issues they care about, and Democrats are united in doing that.\" HOUSE DEMOCRATS PREDICT REPUBLICANS WILL PAY PRICE FOR PASSING TRUMP'S ‘BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL’ Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., speaks at a news conference with other members of House Republican leadership in Washington, D.C., May 6, 2025. The GOP is defending its razor-thin House majority in the 2026 midterm elections.(Nathan Posner/Anadolu via Getty Images) While the party in power after a presidential election — currently the GOP — typically faces political headwinds and loses House seats in the following midterms, the 2026 map appears tofavor Republicans.\"The battlefield is really laying out to our advantage. There are 13 Democrats who won seats also carried by Donald Trump. There are only three Republicans in seats that were carried by [former Vice President] Kamala Harris. So, that tells me we're going to be on offense,\" Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) chair, told Fox News Digital at the start of the 2026 cycle. WHAT THE HOUSE GOP CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE CHAIR TOLD FOX NEWS ABOUT TRUMP'S ROLE IN THE MIDTERMS DelBene countered that \"the reason we have opportunities is because people are outraged, because they do want to see someone come into office who is going to fight for their communities and not just be blindly loyal to a president.\" And pointing to the small bite House Democrats took out of the GOP's majority in the 2024 elections, she added that \"those are the types of candidates that won in our districts last cycle. It's a reason we actually gained seats in 2024 and is absolutely the reason why we're going to take back the majority in 2026.\" But Hudson noted he has a powerful ally as he works to keep control of the House. \"The president understands that he's got to keep the House majority in the midterm so that he has a four-year runway instead of a two-year runway to get his agenda enacted,\" Hudson said. \"He's been extremely helpful to us, and we appreciate it.\" And the Democrats are facing a polling dilemma because the party's ratings have been sinking to historic lows in a number of national surveys so far this year. The Democrats' ratings in a Fox News poll stood at 41% favorable and 56% unfavorable in a survey conducted April 18-21. HEAD HERE TO CHECK OUT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLS That's an all-time low for the Democrats in Fox News polling. And for the first time in a decade, the party's standing was lower thanthat of the GOP,which stood at 44% favorable and 54% unfavorable. The figures were reversed last summer, when Fox News last asked the party favorability question in one of its surveys. (Fox News ) But there is a silver lining for the Democrats. The Fox News poll indicated that if the 2026 midterm elections were held today, 49% of voters would back a generic Democrat in their congressional district, with 42% supporting the generic Republican candidate. The Democrats also have another problem — the possibility of primary challenges against longtime and older House lawmakers in safe blue districts. Recently elected Democratic National Committee (DNC) Vice ChairDavid Hogglast month pledged to spend millions of dollars through his outside political group to support primary challenges against what he termed \"asleep at the wheel\" House Democrats who he argued have not been effective in pushing back against Trump. The move by the 25-year-old Hogg, a survivor of the shooting seven years ago at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in South Florida, to spend money against fellow Democrats ignited a firestorm within the party. Democratic National Committee Vice Chair David Hogg, seen here Aug. 22, 2024, in Chicago, is pledging to support primary challenges against older House Democrats in blue districts.(Dominic Gwinn/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images) In response, DelBene said, \"Democrats across the country are united in taking back the House.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Asked by Fox News if the move by Hogg would force the DCCC and allied super PACs to divert money and resources from competitive districts in order to defend incumbents in safe blue districts from primary challenges, DelBene responded, \"I think everyone knows how important it is that we take back the House, and folks are focused in helping make sure that we do that in districts all across the country.\" But the dispute is giving the GOP ammunition. In response to the intra-Democratic Party feud, NRCC spokesman Mike Marinella argued, \"No Democrat is safe.

    "article_text": "Fox News correspondent Bill Melugin joins ICE in Boston as they arrest criminal migrants, including an alleged murderer and child rapists. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin reacts to pushback to the Trump admin’s deportation agenda. As the Department of Government Efficiency enters a new era with the departure of Elon Musk on Friday, it has caused numerous changes in recent months on matters of immigration and border security. \"DOGE has helped to transform the Federal government by eliminating waste and bloat that has been ignored for years. DOGE is playing a key role in eliminating millions of taxpayer money being misspent, including contracts for illegal alien facilities that sat empty during the Biden Border invasion and funding for hotel rooms to house illegal gang members. DOGE’s mission to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse continues!\" Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, told Fox News Digital in a statement on Friday. In February, the Department of Homeland Security announced that they had gutted an $83 million contract for \"an empty illegal alien facility during an invasion at the southern border\" and the $80 million in FEMA funding to provide lodging forillegal immigrantsin New York City, like the Roosevelt Hotel.

DOGE also posted to X in April that it had found that many illegal immigrants who were on the FBI’s terror watchlist and those who have a criminal history were taking out public benefits. Four on the terror watchlist and 901 other \"paroled aliens\" were \"collecting Medicaid,\" 41 received unemployment benefits, 22 got student loans from the federal government and 409 got a \"net\" tax refund in 2024, according to the department. The cost of the tax refunds was $751,000, Medicaid cost $276,000, and the student loans totaled out to $280,000, the department said.

These paroles have since been terminated with immediate effect. Despite having no other legal status, paroled aliens are able to file for work authorization and receive social security numbers.\" Outside of immigration and border security, DHS said the Coast Guard is expected to save $32.7 million by scrapping an information technology system that was deemed \"ineffective.\" In a video posted in May about the partnership between DOGE and DHS, it said the funds are going to \"frontline operations.\" \"Another win for government efficiency at DHS!\"DHS Secretary Kristi Noemsaid in a statement to Fox News Digital in April.

The changes come as President Donald Trump made major policy changes during the early days of his second term, which has led to a sharp decrease in encounters at the border and a continued crackdown on illegal immigrants with a criminal background in the U.S. interior.

In the research, a total of 889colon cancer patientswho had undergone surgery and had also received chemotherapy were divided into two groups. One group was enrolled in a structured groupexercise programfor a three-year period and a second group received educational health materials, according to a study press release. SIMPLE DIETARY CHANGE COULD LOWER YOUR RISK OF COLON CANCER, STUDY SAYS Led by coaches, the exercise group was permitted to choose their own type of moderate-intensity exercise, such as walking or pickleball. The overall goal was to add 2 ½ hours of activity per week.

    "title": "This daily beauty routine could be ruining your hair, experts warn",
    "article_text": "In an on-camera interview with Fox News Digital, TV personality and clean beauty brand owner Emily Austin expressed her excitement about the push for change with the MAHA movement, calling for U.S.-made products to meet EU standards. For those with ahair care routine, a brush is an essential tool for daily upkeep — but brushing hair while it’s wet could cause more harm than good. The common habit could permanently weaken hair at a \"molecular level,\" according to Dr. Mehmet Erdogan, co-founder and hair transplant surgeon at Smile Hair Clinic in Istanbul. This could lead to increased breakage and thinning over time. A 2022 study from the University of Manchester reflected this, finding that moisture can change hair’s response to stress. OZEMPIC, OTHER SEMAGLUTIDES LINKED TO HAIR LOSS: HERE'S WHAT TO KNOW \"When hair gets wet, it undergoes significant physical changes that can affect its ability to handle stress from brushing,\" Erdogan said in comments shared with Fox News Digital. \"The water causes the hair shaft to swell, stretches the cuticle and makes it more susceptible to breakage.\" \"Applying the right hair care when wet is the best way to maintain healthy hair long-term and to prevent unnecessary thinning caused by breakage,\" an expert shared.(iStock) Although research has shown that wet hair stretches more than dry hair before breaking, Erdogan clarified that this doesn’t mean the hair is more flexible and resilient. \"The opposite is true – this stretching damages the internal protein structure, leading to weaker hair over time,\" he warned. \"Wet hair is more fragile, and rough brushing can cause breakage.\" \"The brush pulls on swollen, weakened strands, causing them to stretch beyond their capacity. As they dry, they don't return to their original state and remain damaged at a structural level.\" MEN GOING BALD TURN TO 'NEW BOTOX' FOR HAIR LOSS TREATMENT Ashley DiMatteo, owner of Ashley Lauren Beauty Lounge in Westchester, New York, told Fox News Digital in an interview that the salon has \"definitely seen\" damage from brushing wet hair. \"Wet hair is more fragile, and rough brushing can cause breakage,\" she said. \"But it’s rarely just one issue –hair loss or damageoften comes from a combination of factors like stress, hormones, heat styling or chemical treatments.\" Ashley DiMatteo (left), owner of Ashley Lauren Beauty Lounge in New York, and Briana Delvecchio (right), a hairdresser and color stylist of 14 years.(Jesse Rinka Photography) Brianna Delvecchio, a color specialist and hairdresser at DiMatteo’s salon, agreed that brushing wet hair can cause breakage, especially while doing so roughly or with the wrong tool. Factors like stress, diet, hormones and overprocessing can also play a role in hair damage, she confirmed. Those who have fine and chemically treated hair – whether colored, permed or relaxed – are \"especially susceptible\" to wet brushing damage, since their protein structure is \"already altered,\" Erdogan noted. The risks don't mean people should skip brushing altogether, Delvecchio said, as not brushing wet hair can sometimes result in a \"knotted, matted mess.\" \"Brushing is necessary — just do it gently and in the right way,\" she advised. People who have chemically treated hair are more susceptible to damage, according to experts.(iStock) With her salon clients, DiMatteo recommends taking a \"gentle approach\" to hair, protecting it from heat, avoiding rough brushing and limiting chemical services. \"We also take time to talk about scalp health,nutrition and lifestyle, because those all play a role,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"And most importantly, don’t ever feel embarrassed or shy to speak to your stylist or local salon. We’re here to help.\" HAIR GROWTH COULD SLOW DOWN WITH THIS POPULAR DIET PLAN, STUDY REVEALS To lower the risk of hair damage, experts recommend using a wide-tooth comb or flexible detangling brush. Experts recommend brushing hair from the bottom and working up to avoid damage.(iStock) \"The flexible bristles are great for detangling without too much tension,\" Delvecchio said. \"It’s a solid option for all hair types, as long as you’re still gentle and patient.\" The salon owner also suggested using a leave-in product to help soften and hydrate the hair, making it \"much easier for the comb to glide through.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Technique matters, too – always start from the bottom and gently work your way up,\" DiMatteo advised. Adding heat to wet hair can \"multiply the damage,\" Erdogan warned. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER For those with straight hair, it's best to allow it to partially air-dry before combing, according to the hair transplant surgeon. The American Academy of Dermatology Association also recommends this approach. Using a flexible detangling brush or wide-tooth comb is best for the hair, experts advise.(iStock) Delvecchio advised going \"easy on your hair\" overall, especially when it's wet. For more Health articles, visitwww.foxnews.com/health. \"Use heat protectant, lower the heat on your tools, avoid overlapping bleach and keep up with trims,\" she suggested. \"Also, brush regularly (wet or dry) to prevent tangles and breakage,\" she went on. \"Hair is delicate, but with the right habits, it can staystrong and healthy.\" Angelica Stabile is a lifestyle reporter for Fox News Digital.",

President Donald Trump signs an executive order barring transgender female athletes from competing in women's or girls' sports, at the White House, Feb. 5, 2025.(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) The executive order, \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports,\" was based on Title IX, part of a civil rights law passed in 1972 that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in federally funded education programs. The order instructed the Department of Education to investigate academic institutions that failed to comply. If a school is deemed to be in noncompliance, federal funds could be withdrawn. Elsewhere, the International Olympic Committee has decided to allow global federations that govern a variety of sports to create their respective eligibility rules. Under Trump's executive order, the State Department is instructed to demand changes within the committee.

The organization'supdated participation policy, which was announced in February, stated that only \"student-athletes assigned female at birth\" will be allowed to take part in intercollegiate athletic competitions. The latest policy does permit \"student-athletes assigned male at birth to practice with women's teams and receive benefits like medical care.\" However, those athletes are banned from any NCAA-sanctioned competitions. In December 2024, NCAA PresidentCharlie Bakertold a Senate committee there were \"less than 10\" transgender college student athletes he was aware of at the time.

    "title": "Trans athlete AB Hernandez takes girls' track and field state championships in California, defying Trump",
    "article_text": "High school cross-country athlete Taylor Starling and her father Ryan weigh in on biological males competing in California girls’ track and field events. Just days after President DonaldTrump sent a warningto California about letting a male compete in girls' track and field, the state allowed a trans athlete to take two state titles against female competitors. AB Hernandez, a transgender student athlete for Jurupa Valley High School, took first place in the girls' high jump and triple jump at thestate championshipon Saturday at Veteran's Memorial Stadium in Clovis, California. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Transgender athlete AB Hernandez of Jurupa Valley competes in the girls high jump during the CIF State Track and Field Championships at Veterans Memorial Stadium on May 30, 2025 in Clovis, California.(Kirby Lee/Getty Images) Hernandez also finished in second place in the long jump to Woodrow Wilson High School's Loren Webster. Webster was the only female to finish ahead of Hernandez in any competition the trans athlete competed in this weekend. Hernandez previously took first place in all three events at the preliminary round on Friday. Meanwhile, female competitors who finished behind Hernandez in this weekend's events were all bumped up one spot and received the medal they would have earned had the trans athlete not competed. The California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) made a series of sweeping rule changes in the days leading up to the event to ensure any females who finished behind a biological male would be appropriately rewarded a medal based on where they placed among female competitors. So during the medal ceremonies for the three events, the female competitors who finished one spot behind Hernandez had to stand next to the trans athlete on the podium.

Conflicting protests plagued the championship starting on Friday with pro-LGBTQ protesters and pro-female protesters wielding signs, flags and clothing expressing their respective messaging. People hold Save Girls Sports signs in protest of transgender athlete AB Hernandez of Jurupa Valley (not pictured) during the CIF State Track and Field Championships at Veterans Memorial Stadium on May 30, 2025 in Clovis, California.(Kirby Lee/Getty Images) On Friday, a plane flying a banner that read \"No Boys in Girls' Sports!\" even passed over the stadium. However, the conflict between the protesters at one point became violent, when an LGBTQ protester allegedly struck local conservative activist Josh Fulfer with a flag pole on Friday. Footage obtained by Fox News Digital shows the LGBTQ protester Ethan Kroll appear to attack Fulfer through a car window, and Kroll subsequently getting arrested. Police records obtained by Fox News Digital show that Kroll, a male, was arrested for assault with a deadly weapon other than a firearm, obstructing a public officer and vandalism. Clovis Police Sgt. Chris Hutchison told Fox News Digital no other criminal incidents occurred at or near the track meet Friday night. \"Our stance is always to allow people to exercise their constitutional right to free speech and protest,\" Hutchison said. \"They have a right to do it in a manner that isn't inciting violence or causing other problems. … We don't have room for violence or property damage or anything like that.\" CALIFORNIA TOWN RALLIES BEHIND TRUMP AS IT HOSTS TRACK AND FIELD CHAMPIONSHIP AMID TRANS ATHLETE CONTROVERSY But on Saturday, California Family Council outreach director Sophia Lorey was escorted out of Veteran's Memorial Stadium by CIF officials for passing out \"Save Girls' Sports\" wristbands with pro-female messaging to spectators. Footage shared by Lorey on social media shows the confrontation between her and the CIF official as Lorey is gestured out of the venue. Lorey told Fox News Digital that she had passed the messages out at previous events without any issues. \"We handed out half-page fliers at the prelims event and we were not told anything that we couldn't do that,\" Lorey said. Fox News Digital has reached out to the CIF for comment on Lorey's video. Lorey and local conservative activist Beth Bourne told Fox News Digital that, unlike previous events, a man on a megaphone repeatedly ordered spectators not to make disparaging comments about any competitors, officials or other spectators on Saturday. Lorey attended a press conference at the meet earlier that day where California 2026 gubernatorial candidate Steve Hilton spoke in support of protecting girls' sports from trans inclusion. Current Governor Gavin Newsom has been the subject of frequent local and national criticism throughout the track and field postseason for enabling the trans athlete to compete, despite previously admitting on his podcast that he believes males competing in girls' sports was \"deeply unfair.\" Trump singled out Newsom in a Truth Social post on Tuesday when he threatened to cut funding to the state if a trans athlete was allowed to compete in the girls' competition this weekend. But the state did not yield to Trump, and instead simply passed the rule changes to accommodate other female athletes. The U.S.Department of Justiceannounced an investigation into the state over the issue on Wednesday, and the U.S. Department of Education has been investigating the state over the issue since February. However, California is far from the only state that saw its girls' track and field championships overshadowed by trans athlete controversy. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP This very same weekend, trans athletes reportedly competed and won state competitions in Maine, Washington, Oregon and Minnesota. Trump signed his \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports\" executive order on Feb. 5, but many Democratic states have openly defied the order, resulting in multiple controversial situations like the one involving Hernandez across the nation in 2025.

(Source: Wisconsin Historical Society) When the Lady Elgin sank onLake Michiganin 1860, British journalist and politician Herbert Ingram was lost to the deep, but 165 years later his pocket watch has returned home. The steamship quickly sank on Sept. 8, 1860, when it collided with a schooner during a storm off Winnetka, Illinois, killing more than 300 people, with many unable to make it to lifeboats before it went down. Ingram and his son both died in the sinking with his gold watch going down with them. After the sinking, Ingram’s body was recovered, and he was returned toEngland,and buried in his hometown of Boston in Lincolnshire. MYSTERIOUS 18TH-CENTURY WARSHIP UNEARTHED AT GROUND ZERO SITE GETS NEW HOME When the Lady Elgin sank on Lake Michigan in 1860, British journalist and politician Herbert Ingram was lost in the deep, but 165 years later his pocket watch has returned home.(WXMI) The pocket watch was discovered by divers in 1992, but remained in the U.S. until this May, when it was given to a historian to examine. \"Back in 1992, when my team wasdocumenting the remainsof the Lady Elgin scattered over more than a mile of lake bottom, other divers were visiting the site,\" Valerie Van Heest, co-founder of the Michigan Shipwreck Research Association who wrote \"Lost on the Lady Elgin,\" toldFOX 17. \"The location had leaked, and a trio of divers I have just recently learned, came upon a pocket watch. A gold pocket watch, an extraordinary discovery.\" She added that Ingram was a \"member of Parliament. He was also the founder of the London Illustrated News, which was the first time a newspaper printed images in the paper. So he was really the founder of pictorial journalism.\" Van Heest toldBBC Newsshe quickly realized that the watch \"doesn't belong in America.

Ingram is celebrated as the \"favorite son\" of the Lincolnshire town where he was born and buried and where a statue of him stands. Van Fleet bought the watch, then donated it to the Boston Guildhall Museum, which happened to be putting together an exhibit on Ingram at the time. \"They didn't have any physical artifacts, and here I was offering not only an artifact, but Herbert Ingram's personal watch,\" Van Heest said. \"It was an extraordinary, serendipitous occurrence.\" Councilor Sarah Sharpe, from Boston Borough Council told the BBC: \"The fact that this small part of him is coming back to his hometown to be displayed is really special and important.\" The watch was returned to Herbert Ingram's hometown of Boston, England, where he remains one of its most influential figures.(Photo by SSPL/Getty Images) The museum celebrated the watch’s return on May 24, calling it a \"day to remember.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Today, Boston came together to honour the life and legacy of Herbert Ingram — journalist, reformer, and one of our town’s most influential figures — as his long-lost gold watch, recovered from the wreck of the Lady Elgin, was officially returned home,\" the museum wrote onFacebook. \"From a private tribute at his grave, to the ceremonial handover at the Ingram Memorial, to the powerful stories shared at Boston Guildhall — every moment was filled with reflection, pride, and awe.\" The museum added, \"Thank you to everyone who joined us today — in person and in spirit.

    "article_text": "Archaeologists in Brussels, Belgium, recently came across the remnants of an old cemetery located in a busy part of the city. The remains date back to the Middle Ages. (Source: @mijnmivb via Facebook) A history buff with a metal detector recently led archaeologists to the site of amedieval monastery– all thanks to a strange symbol spotted on an old map. Arkeologerna, an archaeological organization affiliated with the Swedish government, announced the discovery this month. The remains of the monastery werefound in a field in Derome, in southwest Sweden. In a statement translated from Swedish to English, Arkeologerna credited hobbyist Göran Bengtsson with pinpointing the site. ARCHAEOLOGISTS MAKE GRIM DISCOVERY AFTER FINDING ANCIENT ROMAN BUILDINGS While studying 18th-century maps, Bengtsson noticed a strange rectangle — and brought himself to the site. A surveyor marked the location as \"Klosterkullen,\" or \"monastery hill,\" on a 1760 map. After an alert from Bengtsson, archaeologists headed out to the location to use ground-penetrating radar (GPR) to scope out the site. GPR can show things hidden in the ground — and it revealed the walls of \"probable\" monastery ruins. A history enthusiast's map study led to the discovery of a likely medieval monastery in Sweden, according to local officials.(Arkeologerna) Archaeologist Bengt Westergaard said the find came as a total surprise to him. \"I have worked as an archaeologist for 40 years, and this issomething unique,\" Westergaard said. He added, \"I have never seen anything like it; the walls were very clearly visible.\" \"I have never seen anything like it.\" The weather conditions helped archaeologists, too. Bengtsson found traces of the monastery on a dry summer day. \"When the ground is dry, something called crop marks can form, and these walls are very visible above ground,\" he explained. Bengtsson noticed a perplexing symbol while he was studying 18th-century maps.(Arkeologerna) \"When using ground-penetrating radar, any structures below ground appear as dark spots, and here there was a significant anomaly.\" Archaeologists uncovered walls which are roughly 6.5 feet thick, as well as other facets of the building.

    "title": "Microsoft takes down malware found on 394,000 Windows PCs",
    "article_text": "Just in time for hurricane season, Microsoft is unveiling a new AI-powered weather prediction system. Infostealer malware has been on the rise recently, and that's evident from thebillions of user records leaked online in the past year alone. This type of malware targets everything from your name, phone number and address to financial details and cryptocurrency. Leading the charge is the Lumma infostealer. I have been reporting on this malware since last year, and security researchers have called it one of the most dangerous infostealers, infecting millions. There have been countless incidents of Lumma targeting people's personal data (more on this later), but the good news is that Microsoft has taken it down. The Redmond-based company announced it has dismantled the Lumma Stealer malware operation with the help of law enforcement agencies around the world. Join The FREE CyberGuy Report: Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts, and exclusive deals - plus instant access to myfree Ultimate Scam Survival Guidewhen you sign up! Illustration of a hacker at work(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) Microsoft confirmed that it has successfully taken down the Lumma Stealer malware network in collaboration with law enforcement agencies around the world. In ablog post, the company revealed that its Digital Crimes Unit had tracked infections on more than 394,000 Windows devices globally between March 16 and May 16. Lumma was a go-to tool for cybercriminals, often used to siphon sensitive information like login credentials, credit card numbers, bank account details and cryptocurrency wallet data. The malware’s reach and impact made it a favored choice among threat actors for financial theft and data breaches. MASSIVE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 184 MILLION PASSWORDS AND LOGINS To disrupt the malware’s operation, Microsoft obtained a court order from the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, which allowed the company to take down key domains that supported Lumma’s infrastructure. This was followed by the U.S. Department of Justice stepping in to seize control of Lumma’s core command system and shut down marketplaces where the malware was being sold. International cooperation played a major role as well. Japan’scybercrime unithelped dismantle Lumma’s locally hosted infrastructure, while Europol assisted in actions against hundreds of domains used in the operation. In total, over 1,300 domains were seized or redirected to Microsoft-managed sinkholes to prevent further damage. Microsoft says this takedown effort also included support from industry partners such as Cloudflare, Bitsight and Lumen, which helped dismantle the broader ecosystem that enabled Lumma to thrive. HP laptop(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) NEW MALWARE EXPLOITS FAKE UPDATES TO STEAL DATA Lumma is a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) that has been marketed and sold through underground forums since at least 2022. Over the years, its developers have released multiple versions to continually improve its capabilities. I first reported on Lumma in February 2024, when it wasused by hackers to access Google accountsusing expired cookies that contained login information. Lummacontinued targeting users, with reports in October 2024 revealing it wasimpersonating fake human verification pagesto trick Windows users into sharing sensitive information. The malware wasn’t limited to Windows. In January 2024, security researchers found the infostealer malware wastargeting 100 million Mac users, stealing browser credentials, cryptocurrency wallets and other personal data. Windows laptop(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) HOW TO REMOVE MALWARE ON A PC (2025) To protect yourself from the evolving threat of infostealer malware, which continues to target users through sophisticated social engineering tactics, consider taking these six essential security measures: 1. Be skeptical of CAPTCHA prompts:Legitimate CAPTCHA tests never require you to press Windows + R, copy commands or paste anything into PowerShell. If a website instructs you to do this, it’s likely a scam. Close the page immediately and avoid interacting with it. 2. Don’t click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software:Many infostealer attacks start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company’s official website instead of clicking any links inside the email. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. 3. Enable two-factor authentication:Enabletwo-factor authentication(2FA) whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password. 4. Keep devices updated:Regularlyupdating your operating system, browser and security softwareensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? 5. Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords:If you’ve interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets or financial transactions that you don’t recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using apassword managerto generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about mybest expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here. 6. Invest in a personal data removal service:Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from infostealer malware or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.​Check out my top picks for data removal services here.

MALWARE STEALS BANK CARDS AND PASSWORDS FROM MILLIONS OF DEVICES Microsoft’s takedown of the Lumma Stealermalware network is a major win in the fight against infostealers, which have fueled a surge in data breaches over the past year. Lumma had become a go-to tool for cybercriminals, targeting everything from browser credentials to crypto wallets acrossWindows and Mac systems. I’ve been tracking this malware since early 2024, and its ability to impersonate human verification pages and abuse expired cookies made it especially dangerous.

    "article_text": "Soar above traffc in the air with ease. Imagine gliding through city traffic, not stuck in traffic jams on the road, but soaring above them in the air with ease. The Volonaut Airbike, a jet-powered flying bike developed by Polish entrepreneur Tomasz Patan, is turning this vision into reality. With a top speed of 124 mph and a frame that is seven times lighter than a typical motorcycle, this innovative vehicle could change the way we get around in cities, making travel faster and easier. Join The FREE CyberGuy Report: Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals — plus instant access to myfree Ultimate Scam Survival Guidewhen you sign up! Jet-powered flying bike(Volonaut) Unlike many personal flying devices that depend on large, noisy propellers, theVolonaut Airbikeuses a jet propulsion system. While the exact technical details have not been disclosed, the Airbike's design emphasizes extreme lightness and agility. CHINESE WEARABLE EVTOL JETPACK MAKES HISTORIC FIRST FLIGHT Extensive use of carbon fiber and 3D-printed parts allows the vehicle to weigh just 86 pounds without a rider. This is approximately seven times lighter than an average motorcycle, which typically weighs around 600 pounds. This featherweight construction makes the Airbike nimble and efficient in the air. Jet-powered flying bike(Volonaut) FUTURE OF FLYING? FUEL-SIPPING JET PROMISES QUIETER, GREENER SKIES The Volonaut Airbike can reach speeds of up to 124 miles per hour, making it faster than most motorcycles in traffic. It features a proprietary stabilization system enhanced by aflight computer, which automatically maintains hover and provides ease of control for the rider. This technology allows even those with limited flying experience to handle the bike safely and confidently. The Airbike's open, roofless design offers the rider an unobstructed 360-degree view, creating a sense of complete freedom and immersion in the flying experience. Additionally, the absence of spinning propellers means the Airbike can navigate through tight spaces with greater ease and safety. Jet-powered flying bike(Volonaut) RADICAL NEW TECH BRINGS FLYING CARS CLOSER TO REALITY The Volonaut Airbike's sleek, futuristic silhouette and compact size evoke the image of a flying motorcycle that many have dreamed about for years. Its design and performance bring to life a concept often seen in movies and stories about the future of transportation. Volonaut's promotional videos even feature a rider dressed as a Stormtrooper, highlighting the bike's resemblance to the flying vehicles of popular culture. This playful nod underscores the Airbike's blend of cutting-edge technology and imaginative design. Jet-powered flying bike(Volonaut) ORLANDO'S PLAN FOR FLYING CARS TAKES OFF Tomasz Patan is a visionary engineer with a talent for creating groundbreaking airborne vehicles. He is best known for theJetson One, a quad-rotor electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) drone that can carry a human pilot. Building on the success of that project, Patan has now introduced the Volonaut Airbike, a smaller, more agile flying machine that relies onjet propulsionrather than propellers. His work continues to push the boundaries of what personal flight can achieve. Jet-powered flying bike(Volonaut) BEST FATHER’S DAY GIFTS FOR EVERY DAD When it comes to price, the Volonaut Airbike is still something of a mystery. Patan has not yet revealed an official cost, but if you look at his previous project, the Jetson One drone, which was priced at around $92,000, you can get a rough idea of where the Airbike might land. Given the advanced materials, jet propulsion and sophisticated flight computer involved, it's safe to assume this won't be a budget-friendly ride. However, as with most new technologies, prices often come down over time as production scales up and designs are refined. So, while it might start out as a high-end gadget for early adopters and enthusiasts, there's hope that flying bikes like this could become more accessible in the years ahead. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Jet-powered flying bike(Volonaut) Although the Volonaut Airbike has already been demonstrated in flight, many details remain undisclosed. Patan has not yet revealed the exact propulsion technology, pricing or release date, but he has expressed optimism the Airbike will be available to the public in the near future.

    "title": "America is rediscovering its soul and reviving the sacred",
    "article_text": "OutKick writer Mary Katharine Ham and Democratic strategist Kevin Walling join 'MediaBuzz' to discuss the election of Pope Leo XIV, the first American pope in history, and the U.S. trade deal with the U.K. Faithis making a comeback in America. This is not a statement of hope, but one rooted in research, confirmed by cultural observation, and underscored by national conversations from the White House to the locker room. Recent findings from the Barna Group reflect a spiritual resurgence that is both unexpected and undeniable. According to their data, more Americans—particularly Millennials and Gen Z—are returning to church, reading Scripture, and expressing a desire for spiritual depth. What was once considered a post-Christian society is now showing signs of rediscovering its soul. This reawakening begins in the home. The Barna study reveals agrowing hungeramong families to center life around transcendent values. The notion of God is no longer confined to stained-glass windows or whispered prayers at bedtime—it is returning to the dinner table, to everyday conversation, and to the moral compass guiding how parents raise their children. Amid cultural chaos, many households are reclaiming their role as the first sanctuary, the first seminary, and the first school of truth. RIGHTEOUS HARVEST: HOW FAITH AND FARMING CAN HELP US LIVE THE AMERICAN DREAM We are also witnessingfaith step boldlyback into the public square. From the reestablishment of the White House Faith Office to proclamations such as President Trump’s deeply reverent Easter statement—arguably the boldest and most Christ-exalting language ever issued from the executive branch—faith is once again shaping the national dialogue. The National Day of Prayer is no longer a symbolic moment; it is an echo of America’s founding covenant. This is not about partisanship—it is about spiritual substance becoming part of our civic discourse. But faith is not only being expressed in private homes and public offices. It is emerging in every sector of society. Consider the arts and entertainment world: from American Idol contestants boldly singing worship songs to NFL players kneeling in prayer before and after games, the name of Jesus is being lifted—not with fanfare, but with authenticity. These moments are no longer anomalies. They are becoming patterns. From postgame interviews to acceptance speeches, we are seeing athletes, artists, and cultural figures not just nod to faith, but name their Savior. What we are witnessing is a pushback—not just against unbridled secularism, but against a deeper threat: secular totalitarianism. A culture that once told people to keep their faith private now finds itself enriched bypublic expressionsof belief. Why? Because when secularism becomes dogma, liberty becomes endangered. And in this moment, Americans of all backgrounds are realizing that religious liberty is the final firewall protecting our freedom. This resurgence is not only a victory for people of faith—it is a victory for all people. A nation rooted in a Judeo-Christian moral framework—where the rights of individuals are endowed by God, not granted by government—is a nation that guarantees freedom of conscience, even for those who disagree. It is precisely because of this framework that the atheist, the agnostic, and the seeker can speak freely. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION This is what sets America apart. Even cultural voices once perceived as indifferent to faith are reexamining their foundations. Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman has recently acknowledged a belief in Christ. Joe Rogan, whose podcast reaches millions, is exploring matters of spirituality and ultimate truth. We are living in a moment where scientists, philosophers, and artists are converging on something ancient: belief. We are entering what can only be described as an age ofreligious enlightenment—a season in which faith and reason are no longer in tension, but in tandem. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP This is the age of Aquinas and Augustine, of Kierkegaard and Lewis, of Tolkien, Lennox, Wright, and others. An age where orthodoxy is not an obstacle but a lifeline. Young men and women are hungry for truth, tired of relativism, and ready for something real. This is the pendulum swinging back. Not toward nostalgia—but toward a rediscovery of eternal absolutes. We must celebrate this moment. But we must also steward it. Because what is being built today may very well become the foundation for the America our children inherit tomorrow. Rev. Samuel Rodriguez is the author of Fresh Oil, Holy Fire, New Wine, lead pastor of New Season, one of America's most influential megachurches, and president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference (NHCLC), which represents millions of Christians worldwide. Rodriguez has advised three U.S. Presidents and is the first Latino to participate in multiple presidential inauguration ceremonies. He is also a best-selling author of 12 books, and serves as producer of 7 faith-based films including Breakthrough, Flamin Hot, and Dream King. Rev. Rodriguez has been recognized by CNN, Fox News, The New York Times, Time Magazine, Univision, Telemundo, and NBC as America’s most influential Hispanic Christian leader. Above all, he is dedicated to magnifying the name of Jesus through every aspect of his ministry and life, giving God all the glory for his influence and impact.",

Yet, on the essential issues it is Western audiences who are being misled by progressive journalists whose views are, in turn, dramatically out of step with ordinary South African opinion.South Africa is a violent society. Since it became a democracy in 1994, over650,000 South Africans have been murdered. That is more than the number of intentional homicides across the Western world over the same period eventhough the population of the West approaches 1 billion people while that ofSouth Africa is closer to 60 million. On a per-capita basis, that amounts to amurder rate of around 40 per 100,000 for South Africa, while the global rate is closer to six per 100,000. TRUMP'S CRITICISM OF SOUTH AFRICA'S VIOLENT CRIME CRISIS RECEIVES UNEXPECTED LOCAL SUPPORTIn that already violent climate, armed raids on commercial farmsteads have, over the past three decades, occurred at a multiple of the rate of similar attacks (essentially armed home invasion robberies) across the broader population. In addition, we calculate that roughly 20% of armed raids on farmsteads have resulted in murder as opposed to under 2% for similar attacks elsewhere. We also judge that the rate of attack on Black commercial producers is similar to that faced by their white compatriots.Because Black and White South Africans alike live amidst such violence,murderous chant, ‘Kill the Boer, Kill the farmer,’ that Trump played at length during an Oval Office meeting with his South African counterpart last week, meets with strong popular disapproval locally. An April 2025 poll found that 80% of South Africans either disapprove of the chant, regard it as hate speech or believe that it should be banned. Western audiences may have been told that the chant is purely a metaphorical ‘anti-apartheid’ song, but it was, in fact, first taught to guerrillas during the armed struggle against White rule in both Rhodesia and South Africa, where farmers were regarded as legitimate military targets. US President Donald Trump, right, and Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africa's president, during a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, May 21, 2025.(Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Western audiences are commonly informed that white South Africans, who make up just 7% of South Africa’s population, own \"three-quarters\" of agricultural land whereas black South Africans own just \"4%\". These figures are misdirection. The bulk of White land holdings are in the arid western half of the country. These are areas where the terrain, climate, and population density is similar to that of Arizona, Nevada, or New Mexico. Across the high rainfall and densely populated east of the country approximately half of land by productive value is in black possession, although not ownership. The reason for this is that  the South African government continues to deny individual title across many Black communities preferring instead thatland be held by the stateor its proxies as a means of social and political control. Granting individual title would significantly shift land ownership patterns. Afrikaner refugees from South Africa arrive on Monday at Dulles International Airport in Dulles, Va. On Monday, the Episcopal Church said its Migration Ministries services will refuse a government directive to help resettle White South Africans who have been granted refugee status in the United States.(AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson) The belief that land ownership patterns, as they are, represent a national crisis might be popular in Western media but is not a view held by South Africansthemselves. A recent poll found that top of the list of local concerns was jobcreation, mentioned by over 20% of respondents as South Africa’s single most important challenge. ‘Promoting access to land’ came far down the list, beingmentioned by less than 5% of respondents. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Finally, a recently enacted piece of expropriation legislation, which has drawnthe particular attention of the Trump administration, is not a benign ‘eminentdomain’ measure, as it is presented. It allows any organ of state to seize anykind of property - not just land – for below its market value. A recent poll found that this idea is opposed by just under 70% of South Africans and it is seen as a measure that will be abused by the notoriously corrupt political class. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAt odds with elite opinion in the West the American administration’s concerns around violence, property rights, and economic progress in South Africaresonate closely with the concerns of South Africans themselves who are in the main a pragmatic and conservative people sharing in many of the democratic values held dear by Americans.

    "title": "Elon built the DOGE rocket and it’s going to keep flying",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy has the latest on the departure of the DOGE leader on 'Special Report.' Elon Muskhas led the Department of Government Efficiency to incredible success in a mere four months, exposing hundreds of billions of dollars in government waste. However, with his tenure as a special government employee ending, what becomes of DOGE and the waste it’s identified? What about Tesla and SpaceX? The answers to all these questions are incredibly positive. Musk’s successin so many fields is no accident. The man has an uncanny ability not only as an executive who optimizes institutions and procedures, but also as a delegator. After he gets a project going, he expertly selects someone to take his place, freeing himself up for other ventures. This explains why Musk is able to run so many different, but stillwildly successful businesses, including Tesla, Starlink, X Corporation, the Boring Company, Neuralink, and others. He consistently replaces himself with capable people who can take over operations in his stead. DAVID MARCUS: MUSK’S DOGE CHANGED THE WAY AMERICA SEES FEDERAL SPENDING WASTE This model of leadership handoff in the private sector has translated to the public sector with DOGE, so the American people should anticipate continued success from the Department, even now that Mr. Musk has departed. DOGE has maderemarkable progress, yet they’ve still only scratched the surface. The reality is that the federal budget is almost $7.5 trillion, and it’ll take a considerable amount of time for the DOGE crew to work their way through it all. That said, the early progress made by Mr. Musk specifically and DOGE broadly is all the more remarkable because of all the roadblocks thrown in their way. Activist judges were constantly ordering a halt to DOGE’s activities, while apparatchiks left over from the Biden administration purposely hid information and tried to torpedo DOGE’s investigations. As each roadblock is removed, however, the pace at which DOGE works through thefederal budgetis steadily increasing, and that will continue even after Mr. Musk’s departure. This is not the end of a book, but simply a new chapter. DOGE has been successful in two key areas. First, sunlight is the best disinfectant, and the Department has cast blindingly bright light on all manner of abuse, corruption, fraud, and waste—all of which the political establishment would have liked to have kept hidden from public view. By making the American public aware of how their tax dollars arebeing wasted, political pressure was created to stop that waste. But it all required knowledge of the problem. Before DOGE, for example, there was no proof that over 12.3 million people were 120 years old or older in the Social Security system, a clear sign of fraud. They have now been correctly labeled as deceased to prevent illegitimate payments. Likewise, the public was completely unaware that the Treasury Department was distributing money with no way of tracking where it was going. Because of DOGE, the Treasury and the Federal Reserve now label every payment, so the spending of tax dollars can be tracked. While some of the waste identified by DOGE can simply be ended by executive action, much of it will need to be clawed back by Congress. To that end, DOGE cuts will begin to be codified into law as early as next week when the White House begins sending recission packages to Congress, the first of which will be over $9 billion. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION That’s a good start, but only a start with the aforementioned $7-trillion-plus budget. To realize the hundreds of billions of dollars in potential cuts that DOGE has already identified (and much more in anticipated cuts) will require additional recission packages—and in some cases, new legislation. As for Mr. Musk and his many companies, they have bright futures because of their leader’s proven track record of success. While companies like Tesla have seen turbulent stock prices over the past few months, that has largely mirrored the broader stock market, as opposed to being a reflection on Tesla’s valuation specifically. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Furthermore, Tesla’s share price has risen 60% since failed vice-presidential candidate Tim Waltz infamously mocked the previous decline in Tesla’s share price. Who’s laughing now? Whether it’s Tesla, DOGE, or X Corporation, the future looks very bright. Mr. Musk has a real knack for building both metaphorical and literal rocket ships. E.J.

    "title": "DAN GAINOR: May's 7 craziest stories",
    "article_text": "Former Bernie Sanders staffer Tezlyn Figaro and Fox News host Will Cain discuss new revelations in the alleged cover-up of former President Joe Biden's decline on 'The Will Cain Show.' Perhaps we should stop calling the fifth month of the year May and just start calling itMaybe. LikeMaybeCNN anchor Jake Tapper will be honest about how much he and his network covered up theBiden presidency. Or,Maybethings are getting better even though the press won’t admit it. Tariffs and trade deals didn’t end the economy, despite media rhetoric. That doesn’t mean all is right with the world. It never is. But our friends on the left always say the sky is falling. Maybe they’re just nuts. And that takes me into the land of crazy news. Here are seven reasons why last month May(be) crazy. 1. Irresistible:It’s always a battle to see which major print outlet is the most ridiculously left-wing. The Washington Post, where democracy used to \"die in darkness,\" has a strong claim. But the other major player isThe New York Timesand it’s been that way pretty much my entire life. That’s a long darn time. (Cut me open and count the rings.)Times publisher A.G. Sulzbergermade news this month denying all that. The publisher of The New York Times, A.G. Sulzberger, argued that the media, despite its faults, is critical to a healthy and free nation in a recent essay.(Getty Images) Sulzberger claimed that Gray Lady is \"not the resistance.\" That’s like saying rain isn’t wet and Tapper isn’t egotistical. You can say it, but nobody should believe you. Instead, he didn’t double down, he billioned down. \"We are nobody’s opposition. We’re also nobody’s cheerleader. Our loyalty is to the truth and to a public that deserves to know it,\" he pretended. After nearly a decade of attacks on The Donald, along with years pretending Biden ran the White House, Sulzberger’s keyboard probably melted just typing that. NEW YORK TIMES PUBLISHER SAYS 'WE'RE NOT THE RESISTANCE,' HITS TRUMP FOR ANTI-PRESS RHETORIC 2. Bored in the USA:Aging pop stars likeBruce Springsteenkeep their PR teams busy with nonstop drivel. Bruuuuuuce has been a lefty since before Ronald Reagan was in the White House. The Boss and a parade of similarly out-of-touch stars performed \"No Nukes\" concerts back in 1979. It’s no surprise that now he’s trying to make news bashing PresidentDonald Trump. And, trying to profit from it. Bruce Springsteen performs during the first night of \"The Land of Hopes and Dreams\" tour at Co-op Live on May 14, 2025 in Manchester, England.(Getty Images) What’s pathetic is how little effort he made. Like him or not, Springsteen has written some amazing lyrics. But his anti-Trump comments read like a 22-year-old’s Huffington Post blog: \"[T]the America I’ve written about, and has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration.\" Hardly up to snuff for the man who wrote, \"Is a dream a lie if it don't come true? Or is it something worse?\" The best part is he’s selling a six-track EP with two of the tracks bashing Trump. From \"Born to Run\" to \"Born to Resist.\" Bruce Springsteen performs during the first night of his \"The Land of Hopes and Dreams\" tour at Co-op Live on May 14 in Manchester, England.(Shirlaine Forrest/Getty Images) 3. Mask maker, mask maker…:The COVID pandemic reaction on left and right stems from foundational differences about how safe we expect to be. Safetyism is why lefties think it’s good to censor speech online and off because words make them feel unsafe. Leftists worship infinite safety. DAN GAINOR: JOURNALISM'S ORIGINAL SPIN. 7 WAYS THE TAPPER/THOMPSON BIDEN BOOK ATTEMPTS TO ABSOLVE MEDIA Which takes me to one of my favorite former Washington Post staffers – Taylor Lorenz. That’s because she is still obsessed withCOVID. To hear her talk, we should all be living life like John Travolta when he played \"The Boy in the Plastic Bubble.\" Her Bluesky feed is … special. \"If you’re not masking right now during an ongoing pandemic you should feel shame. In a just world you’d be socially ostracized for cavalierly killing and disabling people.\" she wrote. That included Lorenz, \"celebrating FREE SPEECH at the PornHub awards!\" while wearing a mask. And no, those aren’t old comments. They’re from this May. 4. CNN+ or minus?:We’ve all seen movies where they note the definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result.CNN, come on down.The lefty cable outfit is doing the Michael Keaton thing from \"Multiplicity\" and making copies of copies. CNN CEO Mark Thompson announced this month that the network is going to provide a \"simple and centralized way\" to get all their content. CNN CEO Mark Thompson(Joseph A. Wulfsohn/Fox News Digital) Naturally, you have to pay. According to The New York Times, \"CNN’s new service won’t look like CNN+, its failed $300 million splashy foray into streaming that was stuffed with well-known news and entertainment personalities.\" In other words, they don’t have any money, plan to do this on the cheap and are praying like crazy somebody will rain cash. Maybe they will if the network offers a Tapper-free tier. 5. Knock, knock, who’s there?:In an era of AI videos, stories like this one scream tricks for clicks. Turns out, it’s probably legit.Florida residentshad unwelcome visitors – door-to-door gators. According to the Lee County Sheriff's Office, deputies responded after an alligator kept knocking on a door. The men in blue (or whatever gator-wrangling deputies wear) saw the \"suspicious\" alligator trying to get into a home. Now, I already view my neighbors to the south with caution because they let gators roam golf courses like eager caddies. But when your future pair of boots knocks on the door and wants in, I want out. That’s how Chubbs Peterson lost his hand. (\"Happy Gilmore,\" folks.) 6. Florida Man has competition:Readers of this column know I love animal stories – from gators to baby goats. This month, we’ve got a raccoon with a meth pipe. Shockingly, this story comes from Ohio, not Florida. Springfield Township Police Department found Chewy the raccoon gnawing on the end of a meth pipe. As Mike Gavin from NBC New York put it, \"No, the raccoon will not be charged with drug possession.\" PET RACCOON CAUGHT WITH METH PIPE IN ITS MOUTH WHEN COPS PULLED OVER OHIO WOMAN: 'EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED' Acting on the tip from Chewy, police searched the vehicle and the driver \"was charged with three counts of possession of drug paraphernalia and cited for driving under suspension.\" Raccoons, taking a bite out of crime! CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION 7. Size matters:Before Antifa loons started ripping down statues, leaving your mark on the world with a statue in your honor was a sign of import. From the Pietà to the Lincoln Memorial, some of the greatest works of art honor famous people looking their best. Others are iconic and stand for freedom, like the Statue of Liberty. Then there’s \"Grounded in the Stars,\" by artist Thomas J Price. It’s a temporary bronze statue in Times Square of a 12-foot-tall Black woman looking kind of … plump. The \"Grounded in the Stars\" display will be in Times Square until June 17.(Photo courtesy of OutKick) Now, as a man of some girth, I might have let this one fade into well-deserved obscurity, except the official Times Square website's description of Grounded in the Stars bashed the two great men who have permanent statues there: \"Installed at ground level on a wide low base, the work invites engagement with the hundreds of thousands of people who traverse the plazas each day, the woman inGrounded in the Starscuts a stark contrast to the pedestaled permanent monuments — both white, both men — which bookend Duffy Square, while embodying a quiet gravity and grandeur.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Both white, both men,\" like that’s somehow a bad thing. The two figures are famed Army Chaplain Father Francis P. Duffy, the author of \"You’re a Grand Old Flag,\" and, none other than himself, George M. Cohan. Price was just doing his own version of tearing down statues. He failed. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DAN GAINOR Dan Gainor is a freelance opinion editor for Fox News Digital.

Pogue looked surprised, replying, “Oh, okay, I was told, ‘Anything’s good.’” “No,” Musk said, while looking into the distance. “Well … no.” He did, however, comment on the controversy aroundhis Department of Government Efficiency, which has been making aggressive cuts across federal agencies, and which Musk complained had become “the whipping boy for everything.” “If there was some cut, real or imagined, everyone would blame DOGE,” he said. Musk also suggested that he’s “a little stuck in a bind” when it comes to the Trump administration, where “I don’t want to speak out against the administration, but I also don’t want to take responsibility for everything the administration’s doing.” Pogue’s interview was conducted beforeSpaceX’s Starship test flighton Tuesday, which saw the ship successfully launch but lose control on reentry. Asked whether there’s anything linking his various companies — in addition to SpaceX, there’s Tesla (which facesongoing anti-Musk protests), xAI and X (formerly Twitter), Neuralink, and The Boring Company — Musk replied, “I guess you could think of the businesses as things that improve the probable trajectory of civilization.” At the time, Musk was supposedlypulling back from his government workbut said he would remain involved for a “day or two” per week. He told Pogue, “DOGE is going to continue, just as a way of life. And I will have some participation in that, but as I’ve said publicly, my focus has to be on the companies at this point.” Pogue noted that after their conversation, an interview clip ofMusk’s comments criticizing the Trump-backed budget billdrove a news cycle of their own — and soon after, Musk said he wasending his time as a special government employee.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Elad Gil started betting on AI before most of the world took notice. By the time investors began grasping the implications of ChatGPT, Gil had already written seed checks to startups likePerplexity,Character.AI, andHarvey. Now, as the early winners of the AI wave become clearer, the renowned “solo” VC is increasingly focused on a fresh opportunity: using AI to reinvent traditional businesses and scale them through roll-ups. The idea is to identify opportunities to buy mature, people-intensive outfits like law firms and other professional services firms, help them scale through AI, then use the improved margins to acquire other such enterprises and repeat the process. He has been at it for three years. “It just seems so obvious,” said Gil over a Zoom call earlier this week. “This type of generative AI is very good at understanding language, manipulating language, manipulating text, producing text. And that’s audio, that’s video, that includes coding, sales outreach, and different back-office processes.” If you can “effectively transform some of those repetitive tasks into software,” he said, “you can increase the margins dramatically and create very different types of businesses.” The math is particularly compelling if one owns the business outright, he added. “If you own the asset, you can [transform it] much more rapidly than if you’re just selling software as a vendor,” Gil said. “And because you take the gross margin of a company from, say, 10% to 40%, that’s a huge lift. Suddenly you can buy other companies at a higher price than anyone else because you have that increased cash flow per business; you have enormous leverage on the business on a relative basis, so you can do roll-ups in ways that others can’t.” So far, Gil has backed two companies pursuing this strategy. According to The Information, one is a one-year-old company calledEnam Co., focused on worker productivity, which has been valued at more than $300 million by its backers, including Andreessen Horowitz and OpenAI’s Startup Fund. Though Gil says he can’t discuss specifics of the private deals, he suggests the approach represents something new. “There used to be these technology-enabled roll-ups 10 years ago, and most of them kind of ended up being not really that much of a user of technology,” he says. “It was kind of like a thin veneer painted on to increase the valuation of the company. I think in the case of AI, you can actually radically change the cost structure of these things.” Whether the approach proves as lucrative as some of his other bets remains to be seen. Gil has famously backed a host of big brands that have produced riches for their backers, including Airbnb and Coinbase, both of which are now publicly traded, and privately held Stripe, whose valuation has bounced around but reportedly settled in the range of$91.5 billionearlier this year, when its earlier backers bought up more of its shares. Part of the challenge with roll-ups is finding the right team composition — ideally including a strong technologist along with someone who is “very strong in PE” — and “those things don’t go hand-in-hand,” Gil noted. He said he’s met “maybe two dozen of these teams” so far and mostly looked past them, not because they “weren’t amazing” but because “they still need to sort some things out.” Gil, who has deep relationships with firms across Silicon Valley, may also find himself competing with these frequent collaborators, as a growing number of them,like Khosla Ventures, consider whether to pursue AI roll-ups themselves. One senses that, either way, Gil is not in it for the money at this point if he ever was. He says his ability to spot trends earlier than most comes instead from the heart. “I love technology, and I love progress, and I love just engaging — both with people who are working on important, interesting things, but also the technology itself.” When GPT-3 launched, for example, Gil was already experimenting with its predecessor, he said. “When GPT-3 came out, it was such a big leap from GPT-2 that you could just extrapolate out the technology curve. You’re like, ‘Oh my gosh, if this keeps going and scaling’ — all the scaling laws were kind of evident — ‘then this is going to be transformative.’” That hands-on approach continues today with the small team Gil has assembled, including “people with very deep engineering backgrounds” who “periodically play around with all the AI front-end companies. One person on my team just writes a bunch of scripts and we run them, and we look at performance, and we look at tooling, and it’s super hands-on.” It’s because of that constant tinkering that, after years of uncertainty in the AI market, Gil sees clear winners emerging. “I used to say, even six months ago, that the more I know about AI, the less I know, because the markets were so dynamic; the technologies were so dynamic,” he said. “And I feel like in the last couple months — maybe the last two quarters — a subset of markets have really crystallized.” In legal, “we kind of know who the one or two main winners are probably going to be. That’s true in health care. That’s true in customer success and support,” said Gil, who clearly thinks these include his own portfolio companies, which he cited in our conversation. Among these bets is Harvey, which develops large language models for law firms and in-house legal teams and is reportedly in talks to raise new funding at a$5 billion valuation; Abridge, a healthcare AI company that aims to improve doctors’ clinical documentation workflows (and whose$250 million Series D roundwas co-led by Gil back in February); and Sierra AI, co-founded by famed operator Bret Taylor, which helps companies implement AI agents for customer service. (The company was valued in the billions of dollars right out of the gate.) Still, Gil is careful not to declare the game over. “I don’t mean to paint the picture that the game is over or that things are done. I think it’s more that there were two dozen companies that all seemed kind of interesting, and maybe now there’s three or four of them [per vertical]. The map of the likely winners is solidified.” In the meantime,  it’s clear in conversation that this moment represents more than just another investment cycle to him. “I just think it’s a really fun period of time, because so much change is happening, and so there’s just a ton to do,” he said. Being at the intersection of two transformations — not just betting on the future of AI but on the future of how AI will reshape everything else — is quite simply “exciting,” he added. We’ll have more from our conversation with Gil — which also touched on guardrails, gatekeeping, and how companies can most adeptly integrate the technologies that will make or break their business — in the newest episode of theStrictlyVC Download podcast, which comes out on Tuesday.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us In“The Optimist: Sam Altman, OpenAI, and the Race to Invent the Future,”Wall Street Journal reporter Keach Hagey examines our AI-obsessed moment through one of its key figures — Sam Altman, co-founder and CEO of OpenAI. Hagey begins with Altman’s Midwest upbringing, then takes readers through his career at startup Loopt, accelerator Y Combinator, and now at OpenAI. She alsosheds new light on the dramatic few dayswhen Altman was fired, then quickly reinstated, as OpenAI’s CEO. Looking back at what OpenAI employees now call “the Blip,” Hagey said the failed attempt to oust Altman revealed that OpenAI’s complex structure — with a for-profit company controlled by a nonprofit board — is “not stable.” And with OpenAIlargely backing down from plans to let the for-profit side take control, Hagey predicted that this “fundamentally unstable arrangement” will “continue to give investors pause.” Does that mean OpenAI could struggle to raise the funds it needs to keep going? Hagey replied that it could “absolutely” be an issue. “My research into Sam suggests that he might well be up to that challenge,” she said. “But success is not guaranteed.” In addition, Hagey’s biography (also available asan audiobook on Spotify) examines Altman’s politics, which she described as “pretty traditionally progressive” — making it a bit surprising that he’s struckmassive data center dealswith the backing of the Trump administration. “But this is one area where, in some ways, I feel like Sam Altman has been born for this moment, because he is a deal maker and Trump is a deal maker,” Hagey said. “Trump respects nothing so much as a big deal with a big price tag on it, and that is what Sam Altman is really great at.” In an interview with TechCrunch, Hagey also discussed Altman’s response to the book, his trustworthiness, and the AI “hype universe.” This interview has been edited for length and clarity. You open the book by acknowledging some of the reservations that Sam Altman had about the project —  this idea that we tend to focus too much on individuals rather than organizations or broad movements, and also that it’s way too early to assess the impact of OpenAI. Did you share those concerns? Well, I don’t really share them, because this was a biography. This project was to look at a person, not an organization. And I also think that Sam Altman has set himself up in a way where itdoesmatter what kind of moral choices he has made and what his moral formation has been, because the broad project of AI is really a moral project. That is the basis of OpenAI’s existence. So I think these are fair questions to ask about a person, not just an organization. As far as whether it’s too soon, I mean, sure, it’s definitely [early to] assess the entire impact of AI. But it’s been an extraordinary story for OpenAI — just so far, it’s already changed the stock market, it has changed the entire narrative of business. I’m a business journalist. We do nothing but talk about AI, all day long, every day. So in that way, I don’t think it’s too early. And despite those reservations, Altman did cooperate with you. Can you say more about what your relationship with him was like during the process of researching the book? Well, he was definitely not happy when he was informed about the book’s existence. And there was a long period of negotiation, frankly. In the beginning, I figured I was going to write this book without his help — what we call, in the business, a write-around profile. I’ve done plenty of those over my career, and I figured this would just be one more. Over time, as I made more and more calls, he opened up a little bit. And [eventually,] he was generous to sit down with me several times for long interviews and share his thoughts with me. Has he responded to the finished book at all? No. He did tweet about the project, about his decision to participate with it, but he was very clear that he was never going to read it. It’s the same way that I don’t like to watch my TV appearances or podcasts that I’m on. In the book, he’s described as this emblematic Silicon Valley figure. What do you think are the key characteristics that make him representative of the Valley and the tech industry? In the beginning, I think it was that he was young. The Valley really glorifies youth, and he was 19 years old when he started his first startup. You see him going into these meetings with people twice his age, doing deals with telecom operators for his first startup, and no one could get over that this kid was so smart. The other is that he is a once-in-a-generation fundraising talent, and that’s really about being a storyteller. I don’t think it’s an accident that you have essentially a salesman and a fundraiser at the top of the most important AI company today. That ties into one of the questions that runs through the book — this question about Altman’s trustworthiness. Can you say more about the concerns people seem to have about that? To what extent is he a trustworthy figure? Well, he’s a salesman, so he’s really excellent at getting in a room and convincing people that he can see the future and that he has something in common with them. He gets people to share his vision, which is a rare talent. There are people who’ve watched that happen a bunch of times, who think, “Okay, what he says does not always map to reality,” and have, over time, lost trust in him. This happened both at his first startup and very famously at OpenAI, as well as at Y Combinator. So it is a pattern, but I think it’s a typical critique of people who have the salesman skill set. So it’s not necessarily that he’s particularly untrustworthy, but it’s part-and-parcel of being a salesman leading these important companies. I mean, there also are management issues that are detailed in the book, where he is not great at dealing with conflict, so he’ll basically tell people what they want to hear. That causes a lot of sturm-und-drang in the management ranks, and it’s a pattern. Something like that happened at Loopt, where the executives asked the board to replace him as CEO. And you saw it happen at OpenAI as well. You’ve touched on Altman’s firing, which was also covered ina book excerptthat was published in the Wall Street Journal. One of the striking things to me, looking back at it, was just how complicated everything was — all the different factions within the company, all the people who seemed pro-Altman one day and then anti-Altman the next. When you pull back from the details, what do you think is the bigger significance of that incident? The very big picture is that the nonprofit governance structure is not stable. You can’t really take investment from the likes of Microsoft and a bunch of other investors and then give them absolutely no say whatsoever in the governance of the company. That’s what they have tried to do, but I think what we saw in that firing is how power actually works in the world. When you have stakeholders, even if there’s a piece of paper that says they have no rights, they still have power. And when it became clear that everyone in the company was going to go to Microsoft if they didn’t reinstate Sam Altman, they reinstated Sam Altman. In the book, you take the story up to maybe the end of 2024. There have been all these developments since then, which you’ve continued to report on, including this announcement that actually, they’re not fully converting to a for-profit. How do you think that’s going to affect OpenAI going forward? It’s going to make it harder for them to raise money, because they basically had to do an about-face. I know that the new structure going forward of the public benefit corporation is not exactly the same as the current structure of the for-profit — it is a little bit more investor friendly, it does clarify some of those things. But overall, what you have is a nonprofit board that controls a for-profit company, and that fundamentally unstable arrangement is what led to the so-called Blip. And I think you would continue to give investors pause, going forward, if they are going to have so little control over their investment. Obviously, OpenAI is still such a capital intensive business. If they have challenges raising more money, is that an existential question for the company? It absolutely could be. My research into Sam suggests that he might well be up to that challenge. But success is not guaranteed. Like you said, there’s a dual perspective in the book that’s partly about who Sam is, and partly about what that says about where AI is going from here. How did that research into his particular story shape the way you now look at these broader debates about AI and society? I went down a rabbit hole in the beginning of the book, [looking] into Sam’s father, Jerry Altman, in part because I thought it was striking how he’d been written out of basically every other thing that had ever been written about Sam Altman. What I found in this research was a very idealistic man who was, from youth, very interested in these public-private partnerships and the power of the government to set policy. He ended up having an impact on the way that affordable housing is still financed to this day. And when I traced Sam’s development, I saw that he has long believed that the government should really be the one that is funding and guiding AI research. In the early days of OpenAI, they went and tried to get the government to invest, as he’s publicly said, and it didn’t work out. But he looks back to these great mid-20th century labs like Xerox PARC and Bell Labs, which are private, but there was a ton of government money running through and supporting that ecosystem. And he says, “That’s the right way to do it.” Now I am watching daily as it seems like the United States is summoning the forces of state capitalism to get behind Sam Altman’s project to build these data centers, both in the United States and now there was just one last weekannounced in Abu Dhabi. This is a vision he has had for a very, very long time. My sense of the vision, as he presented it earlier, was one where, on the one hand, the government is funding these things and building this infrastructure, and on the other hand, the government is also regulating and guiding AI development for safety purposes. And it now seems like the path being pursued is one where they’re backing away from the safety side and doubling down on the government investment side. Absolutely. Isn’t it fascinating? You talk about Sam as a political figure, as someone who’s had political ambitions at different times, but also somebody who has what are in many ways traditionally liberal political views while being friends with folks like — at least early on — Elon Musk and Peter Thiel. And he’s done a very good job of navigating the Trump administration. What do you think his politics are right now? I’m not sure his actual politics have changed, they are pretty traditionally progressive politics. Not completely — he’s been critical about things like cancel culture, but in general, he thinks the government is there to take tax revenue and solve problems. His success in the Trump administration has been fascinating because he has been able to find their one area of overlap, which is the desire to build a lot of data centers, and just double down on that and not talk about any other stuff. But this is one area where, in some ways, I feel like Sam Altman has been born for this moment, because he is a deal maker and Trump is a deal maker. Trump respects nothing so much as a big deal with a big price tag on it, and that is what Sam Altman is really great at. You open and close the book not just with Sam’s father, but with his family as a whole. What else is worth highlighting in terms of how his upbringing and family shapes who he is now? Well, you see both the idealism from his father and also the incredible ambition from his mother, who was a doctor, and had four kids and worked as a dermatologist. I think both of these things work together to shape him. They also had a more troubled marriage than I realized going into the book. So I do think that there’s some anxiety there that Sam himself is very upfront about, that he was a pretty anxious person for much of his life, until he did some meditation and had some experiences. And there’s his current family — he just had a baby and got married not too long ago. As a young gay man, growing up in the Midwest, he had to overcome some challenges, and I think those challenges both forged him in high school as a brave person who could stand up and take on a room as a public speaker, but also shaped his optimistic view of the world. Because, on that issue, I paint the scene of his wedding: That’s an unimaginable thing from the early ‘90s, or from the ‘80s when he was born. He’s watched society develop and progress in very tangible ways, and I do think that that has helped solidify his faith in progress. Something that I’ve found writing about AI is that the different visions being presented by people in the field can be so diametrically opposed. You have these wildly utopian visions, but also these warnings that AI could end the world. It gets so hyperbolic that it feels like people are not living in the same reality. Was that a challenge for you in writing the book? Well, I see those two visions — whichfeelvery far apart — actually being part of the same vision, which is that AI is super important, and it’s going to completely transform everything. No one ever talks about the true opposite of that, which is, “Maybe this is going to be a cool enterprise tool, another way to waste time on the internet, and not quite change everything as much as everyone thinks.” So I see the doomers and the boomers feeding off each other and being part of the same sort of hype universe. As a journalist and as a biographer, you don’t necessarily come down on one side or the other — but actually, can you say where you come down on that? Well, I will say that I find myself using it a lot more recently, because it’s gotten a lot better. In the early stages, when I was researching the book, I was definitely a lot more skeptical of its transformative economic power. I’m less skeptical now, because I just use it a lot more.

    "title": "UK to build up to 12 new attack submarines",
    "article_text": "The UK will build up to 12 new attack submarines, the prime minister will announce as the government unveils its major defence review on Monday. The review is expected to recommend the armed forces move to \"warfighting readiness\" to deter growing threats faced by the UK. Sir Keir Starmer will say up to 12 conventionally-armed nuclear-powered submarines will replace the UK's current fleet from the late 2030s onwards. The prime minister is also expected to confirm the UK will spend £15bn on its nuclear warhead programme. Sir Keir will say that, alongside the UK's nuclear-armed submarines, the new vessels would keep \"Britain and Nato safe for decades\". The Strategic Defence Review, commissioned by Labour, will shape the UK's armed forces for years to come. Led by ex-Labour defence secretary Lord Robertson it will make 62 recommendations, which the government is expected to accept in full. Other announcements in the review will include: Defence Secretary John Healey has signalled he is not aiming to increase the overall size of the Army before the next general election. On Sunday, he said his \"first job\" was to reverse a decline in numbers with a target to return to a strength of 73,000 full-time soldiers \"in the next Parliament\". Building the new submarines will support 30,000 jobs into the 2030s as well as 30,000 apprenticeships and 14,000 graduate roles across the next 10 years, the Ministry of Defence said. Healey said: \"Our outstanding submariners patrol 24/7 to keep us and our allies safe, but we know that threats are increasing and we must act decisively to face down Russian aggression.\" The Astute class is the Royal Navy's current fleet of attack submarines, which have nuclear-powered engines and are armed with conventional torpedoes and missiles. As well as protecting maritime task groups and gathering intelligence, they protect the Vanguard class of submarines that carry the UK's trident nuclear missiles. In the Astute series, HMS Agamemnon, waslaunched last Octoberand another is under construction which will take the number of submarines in this class to seven. The next generation of attack submarines that will replace them, SSN-AUKUS, have been developed with the Australian Navy under adeal agreed in 2023by the Conservative government. Meanwhile work on modernising the warheads carried by Trident Missiles is already under way. The £15bn investment into the warhead programme will back the government's commitments to maintain the continuous-at-sea nuclear deterrent. In his announcement on Monday, Sir Keir is to repeat a Labour manifesto commitment to deliver the Dreadnought class of nuclear-armed submarines, which are due to replace the ageing Vanguard fleet from the early 2030s onwards. The MoD's Defence Nuclear Enterprise accounts for 20% of its budget and includes the cost of building four Dreadnought class submarines. Commitments on military spending come against the background of the government's wider review of departmental spending due later this month and have also taken on renewed importance given the Ukraine war, and pressure from Nato and US President Donald Trump for European countries to step up defence spending. Sir Keir has committed the government to spending 2.5% of the UK's national income on defence by 2027, up from 2.3%, but has faced pressure to commit to 3%. Healey said the target will be hit by 2034 but the Conservatives say the threshold should be hit earlier.  The Liberal Democrats have also argued for a 3% spending target. Shadow defence secretary James Cartlidge said Labour's review should be \"taken with a pinch of salt\" unless the government showed there would be enough money to pay for it. Head of NATO, Mark Rutte has called on allies to spend 3.5% of its GDP on defence, with a further 1.5% on defence related expenditure. The government has said it wants Britain to be the leading European nation within the NATO alliance but that might prove difficult when a significant number of allies exceed the UK's military spending. It says its review will reverse decades of underinvestment in Britain's armed forces. But it remains to be seen if the investment will be enough. The ambitions of past defence reviews have rarely been matched by resources. Ernest Williams, 90, has been fighting for more than 40 years to get the pension he says he deserves. At least six new factories will be built and up to 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons will be procured. A government source says the defence secretary has \"full confidence\" in Labour's plans to increase defence spending. The strategic defence review, announced by the government last July, will be published on Monday. Two by-elections will be held in July for wards on North Tyneside Council.",

    "title": "Ukraine's audacious drone attack sends critical message to Russia - and the West",
    "article_text": "It's hard to exaggerate the sheer audacity - or ingenuity - that went into Ukraine's countrywide assault on Russia's air force. We cannot possibly verify Ukrainian claims that the attacks resulted in $7bn (£5.2bn) of damage, but it's clear that \"Operation Spider's Web\" was, at the very least, a spectacular propaganda coup. Ukrainians are already comparing it with other notable military successes since Russia's full-scale invasion, including the sinking of the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, the Moskva, and the bombing of the Kerch Bridge, both in 2022, as well as a missile attack on Sevastopol harbour the following year. Judging by details leaked to the media by Ukraine's military intelligence, the SBU, the latest operation is the most elaborate achievement so far. In an operation said to have taken 18 months to prepare, scores of small drones were smuggled into Russia, stored in special compartments aboard freight trucks, driven to at least four separate locations, thousands of miles apart, and launched remotely towards nearby airbases. \"No intelligence operation in the world has done anything like this before,\" defence analyst Serhii Kuzan told Ukrainian TV. \"These strategic bombers are capable of launching long-range strikes against us,\" he said. \"There are only 120 of them and we struck 40. That's an incredible figure.\" It is hard to assess the damage, but Ukrainian military blogger Oleksandr Kovalenko says that even if the bombers, and command and control aircraft were not destroyed, the impact is enormous. \"The extent of the damage is such that the Russian military-industrial complex, in its current state, is unlikely to be able to restore them in the near future,\" he wrote on his Telegram channel. The strategic missile-carrying bombers in question, the Tu-95, Tu-22, and Tu-160 are, he said, no longer in production. Repairing them will be difficult, replacing them impossible. The loss of the supersonic Tu-160, he said, would be especially keenly felt. \"Today, the Russian Aerospace Forces lost not just two of their rarest aircraft, but truly two unicorns in the herd,\" he wrote. Beyond the physical damage, which may or may not be as great as analysts here are assessing, Operation Spider's Web sends another critical message, not just to Russia but also to Ukraine's western allies. My colleague Svyatoslav Khomenko, writing for the BBC Ukrainian Service website, recalls a recent encounter with a government official in Kyiv. The official was frustrated. \"The biggest problem,\" the official told Svyatoslav, \"is that the Americans have convinced themselves we've already lost the war. And from that assumption everything else follows.\" Ukrainian defence journalist Illia Ponomarenko, posting on X, puts it another way, with a pointed reference to President Volodymyr Zelensky's infamous Oval office encounter with Donald Trump. \"This is what happens when a proud nation under attack doesn't listen to all those: 'Ukraine has only six months left'. 'You have no cards'. 'Just surrender for peace, Russia cannot lose'.\" Even more pithy was a tweet from the quarterly Business Ukraine journal, which proudly proclaimed \"It turns out Ukraine does have some cards after all. Today Zelensky played the King of Drones.\" This, then, is the message Ukrainian delegates carry as they arrive in Istanbul for a fresh round of ceasefire negotiations with representatives from the Kremlin: Ukraine is still in the fight. The Americans \"begin acting as if their role is to negotiate for us the softest possible terms of surrender,\" the government official told Svyatoslav Khomenko. \"And then they're offended when we don't thank them. But of course we don't – because we don't believe we've been defeated.\" Despite Russia's slow, inexorable advance through the battlefields of the Donbas, Ukraine is telling Russia, and the Trump administration, not to dismiss Kyiv's prospects so easily. Fire crews were called to the scene after a road bridge came down in Bryansk. Two bridges in Kursk and Bryansk districts came down overnight within hours of each other, authorities said. Three Ukrainians describe everyday life and the risks of defying Russian occupation. Russia says it is sending its negotiators to Turkey for a second round of ceasefire talks on 2 June. Data shows that Russian fossil fuel revenues are three times higher than aid allocated to Ukraine.",

    "title": "Katie Piper: 'Ageing can be compared to a bereavement'",
    "article_text": "Presenter and campaigner Katie Piper has told an audience at the Hay Festival in Wales that \"ageing can be compared to a bereavement.\" The former model has had hundreds of surgeries to repair damage to her face and eyesight following an attack on the orders of her ex-boyfriend, which took place when she was 24 in 2008. Piper's latest book, which is published on Friday, is titled Still Beautiful: On Age, Beauty and Owning Your Space. The 41-year-old said: \"Women age out of the male gaze. I was ripped from the male gaze at 24. I didn't just become invisible. I became a target for people saying derogatory things.\" She expanded on her description of ageing being like a bereavement: \"Sometimes we know we're losing somebody or something, and it's slow, it's gradual, and when it's ageing, we look down at our hands, we see they look different. \"We catch ourselves in the shop window, and everything's changed.\" Piper, who is also a presenter on the BBC programme Songs of Praise and ITV's Loose Women. said she had recently been asked if writers minded if they mentioned her age. \"It was shocking, but not surprising. This was because I had been reminded at such a young age the currency and the power a woman holds when she is considered either beautiful or young, and now here I was going through the second phase of youth slipping away and feeling, once again, society's judgement and the label that they were going to put on to me.\" She said: \"I wanted to write this book... to really tell people where I have found myself, not just when I was no longer considered beautiful, but when I was told that I was losing my power because I was no longer a young woman. \"Among my peers, I'm not the most beautiful, I'm not the youngest, but I'm one of the most powerful.\" In the book, Piper poses the question: \"What if ageing is the magic key to letting go of other people's expectations and truly starting to live how we want to live?\" She told the audience: \"It makes you in control of your own destiny. And that scares some people, because if we are no longer insecure, if we're confident, if we're not chasing something unpaid, what can they sell to us? What overpriced cream and diet and contraption will we spend our money on? \"We really glamorise youth. We talk about our 20s, [as] the time of your life, the best years.  Okay, I had a very different 20s than most, because I was in the hospital, but your average 20-year-old, it's actually the time for mistakes... where you're least financially secure, you're least experienced. You don't really have as much confidence to put boundaries in.\" She said she felt positive about getting older. \"I'm going to be 42 in October. I'm still incredibly young to many, and old and past it to some. You realise, 'I know who I am.' I have a strong sense of self and identity. This is the heyday. This is the time of my life. So I can only imagine what's on [for the] 50s and 60s  and the decades beyond. I feel excited by that second chapter.\" Piper, who mentors victims of acid attacks through the Katie Piper Foundation, recounted two stories when she had faced discrimination because of the way she looked. In one incident, some men in a van whistled at her when they saw her from behind but then threw a sandwich at her when they saw her face (she was wearing a plastic mask at the time following some treatment). Another time, a first date walked out on her in a London restaurant leaving her to pick up a tab that was more than £700. Despite such experiences, Piper said: \"You need to realise, on the whole, people are really good. Seventeen years ago, when I did that first cutting edge documentary (Channel 4's Katie: My Beautiful Face), what it did is it opened me up to the good side of society. Up until that point, I had seen true evil in mankind, but only in two people (her attackers).\" She said if she had to give one message to her younger self, it would be: \"If you've ever felt less than... you've hated yourself or felt ashamed, it was never you. It was society, consumerism and capitalism. It was beneficial to someone, somewhere, to hold you down. \"Whether that was in a relationship, a corporate company or a brand, it was never you. You were always fine just as you are, and you always will be.\" Former US President Bill Clinton and best-selling author James Patterson sat down with the BBC to discuss how real life informed their new political thriller, The First Gentleman. The popular author tells the Hay Festival she would be wary of writing about Beaker in later life. Zadie Smith and Ian McEwan are among 380 writers and groups to call the war a \"genocide\". The actress and writer gets the drama gong at the festival where she is speaking about her novel.

    "title": "Chinook families to launch legal action against MoD",
    "article_text": "Families of those killed in an RAF Chinook helicopter crash in 1994 have said they are launching legal action against the Ministry of Defence (MoD) for not ordering a public inquiry. Four crew and 25 passengers were killed when the helicopter went down in foggy conditions over the Mull of Kintyre in Scotland. The helicopter was carrying leading security personnel from RAF Aldergrove in Northern Ireland to a conference at Fort George near Inverness. The families of the victims want a High Court judge to review information which they say was not included in previous investigations. They believe it will offer new information on the airworthiness of the helicopter. All 25 passengers - made up of personnel from MI5, the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the British Army - were killed, along with the helicopter's four crew members. The families of the victims, who have formed the Chinook Justice Campaign, said failing to order a public inquiry is a breach of the UK government's human rights obligations. In a letter to the government, the group said: \"The investigations conducted to date, whether considered individually or in combination, have failed to discharge the investigative duty.\" Thirty-one years after, the group have also called for the release of documents that were sealed at the time of the crash for 100 years, as revealed in aBBC documentarylast year. The solicitor representing the families said there is enough evidence to convince the families that there was \"a failure by the MoD to apply appropriate safeguards in order to protect the passengers and crew\". Solicitor Mark Stephens added: \"In fact, they were put on board an aircraft that was known to be positively dangerous and should never have taken off. \"That is why we are seeking a judicial review into the government's failure to hold a public inquiry - which the families have sought for more than a year.\" After the crash, pilots Richard Cook and Jonathan Tapper, were accused of gross negligence, but this verdict was overturned by the UK government 17 years later. A subsequent review by Lord Philip set out \"numerous concerns\" raised by those who worked on the Chinooks. The MoD's testing centre at Boscombe Down in Wiltshire declared the Chinook Mk2 helicopters \"unairworthy\" prior to the crash. Esme Sparks, who was seven years old when her father Major Gary Sparks lost his life, said: \"We don't want to have to take legal action against the government and MoD but we do want and need answers surrounding the circumstance of this crash. \"We want to know who or what is being protected? Who made the decision to let this helicopter take off? What is being hidden? In our view, a public inquiry is key.\" The MoD said that records held in The National Archives contain personal information and early release of those documents would breach their data protection rights. An MoD spokesperson said: \"The Mull of Kintyre crash was a tragic accident and our thoughts and sympathies remain with the families, friends and colleagues of all those who died.\" South Belfast councillor Tracy Kelly is set to be named the city's second female unionist lord mayor. Séamus Dooley says the former Sinn Féin leader's libel win over the BBC shows the need for a review of Irish defamation laws.

    "article_text": "Former Race Across the World contestant Sam Gardiner has died after a crash. The 24-year-old had been driving on the A34 near Manchester on Monday night when his car left the road and rolled before landing on its side, Greater Manchester Police said. He was the only person in the vehicle and was taken to hospital where he died of his injuries on Thursday, his family said in a recent statement. The landscape gardener appeared with his mother Jo as they travelled across South America in the second series of the BBC show, which aired in 2020. They were unable to compete in the final leg after running out of money, but Sam described it as a \"life-changing\" experience. While filming for the BBC series, Sam said: \"Mum and I are very close - we often think or say the same things. \"She has travelled a lot in her life, so I think it would be fun to do it with her.\" In a statement issued by a family member, Sam's parents Jo and Andrew said they were \"devastated\". \"Sam left us far too soon, and while words will never fully capture the light, joy and energy he brought into our lives, we hold on to the memories that made him so special,\" they added. Sam's parents said he was \"adored by his family\" and described him as \"loyal, funny and fiercely protective\". They added the Race Across the World experience \"opened Sam's eyes to the wonder of adventure\". Sam's uncle Jonny Gray told the BBC: \"What you saw was what you got. Sam loved gardening, animals and doing physical activity.\" Mr Gray said his sister Jo and Sam had a \"special relationship\" and were an \"enormous hit on the show\", adding: \"The public really loved them.\" Emon Choudhury, who won the second series with his nephew Jamiul,posted on social mediathat Sam was \"pure sunshine in human form\" whose \"kindness was a beacon for anyone lucky enough to cross his path\". He added that Sam and his mother \"showed us what it truly means to live fully, love fiercely, and embrace every moment with an open heart\". In a statement, a Race Across the World spokeswoman said: \"Everyone who worked with him and indeed everyone who watched Sam could see just how precious and transformative the trip was for both him and his mum, Jo. \"Sam embraced the seven-week trip with an energy, love and a determination that saw the pair enjoy adventures across Mexico to Argentina making audiences fall in love with them and their special bond as a result. \"Since filming, both Sam and Jo have been an integral part of the Race Across the World cast family and on behalf of us all from the BBC, production and the rest of the cast, we would like to extend our deepest condolences to his parents, Andrew and Jo; his brothers, William and Charlie; his step mum Justine; his family and friends.\" Sam had been recently working on the west coast of Scotland and travelled down to Stockport in Greater Manchester to attend a family birthday celebration earlier this week, according to his uncle.

    "article_text": "This week, it's time for the latest instalment in the John Wick franchise, asBallerinahits the big screen. But that's not all the next seven days have in store. TheNintendo Switch 2also launches, and TikTok starAddison Raeis releasing her debut studio album. Read on for what's coming up this week... It’s been a few years since we last saw John Wick, but fans will be gearing up forBallerina, the latest film in the franchise, which comes out on Friday. Set during the events of John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum, the film follows Eve Macarro (Ana de Armas), a ballerina-turned-assassin who uncovers secrets from her family's past. It’s directed by Len Wiseman, who described it in press notes as \"kind of the opposite of John Wick's story. Wick is trying to get out of his life as an assassin; Eve is wanting in - she wants to be a killer”. Keanu Reeves, who plays the title character in the John Wick franchise, is also starring in Ballerina - but the extent of his involvement is still unknown. According to The Hollywood Reporter, he recently said he spent only “eight days” on set of the new film. “But it was fun to play the role again and I'm excited for people to see the film. It's in the spirit of John Wick and has new characters and opens up some stuff, so hopefully people like it,” he added. By Tom Gerken, technology reporter Thursday may seem like any other day of the week to some - but it's a date gamers have had marked on their diaries for months. Hundreds of thousands, perhaps even a million, people will unbox their very ownNintendo Switch 2, the sequel to the third-best selling console in history. I was one of the lucky few to get my hands on it last month, and it makes quite a first impression. It's like a Switch - but with a bigger and brighter screen, and of course much more power under the hood. It also has a cool hook - you can use the controller like a computer mouse by twisting it on its side, making PC games such as Civilization VII a more enjoyable experience than struggling with joysticks. It's not all good news for gamers though as that power comes with a cost - not only is the hardware more expensive than Nintendo fans may be used to, some games are too. A physical copy of Mario Kart World costs a whopping £74.99. But with pre-orders selling out worldwide, at least for now it's looking like Nintendo might well be onto another winner. By Annabel Rackham, culture reporter Addison Raeis a TikTok creator with nearly 90 million followers, a Netflix movie star and also a singer on the brink of releasing her debut studio album. Called Addison, it’s out on Friday and the 24-year-old says it has been inspired by the music of Charli XCX and Madonna. Overseen by Swedish super producer Max Martin's publishing company, Rae has co-written every song, with the album produced between Los Angeles, New York and Sweden. Five songs from the album have already been released – with last year's summer hit Diet Pepsi by far the biggest success story. It reached the top 10 in the UK singles chart and served as Rae's breakthrough hit. Fans can expect \"hypnotic, trance-like pop songs, pulsating and lush\" on the album with lyrics that make you feel \"young, fun and free\" accordingto Rolling Stone writer Brittany Spanos. The co-owners of music venue Rebellion say they \"cannot afford\" a legal battle over noise. Sam Gardiner featured in the second series of the TV show with his mum Jo in 2020.

    "article_text": "Paris St-Germain became the 24th team to win the Champions League Paris St-Germain's players celebrated their Champions League victory in the city on Sunday afternoon, hours after trouble broke out across France. The Ligue 1 clubbeat Inter Milan 5-0 in Saturday's finalin Munich to claim their first Champions League title. Luis Enrique's side held an hour-long open-top bus parade through the city, running from the Champs Elysees to the Arc de Triomphe. There was a heavy police presence for the celebrations, following thewidespread disorder in France that occurred on Saturday nightafter the match, when two people died. A 17-year-old boy died after being stabbed in the chest in the south-west town of Dax, while a 23-year-old man who was riding a scooter in central Paris was also killed after being hit by a vehicle. Paris police prefect Laurent Nunez said 192 people were injured in the overnight clashes, with 491 arrests in Paris alone. Flares and fireworks were set off, bus shelters smashed and cars torched, with much of the disorder occurring in the capital. Twenty-two police officers and seven firefighters were injured, while 264 vehicles were set on fire. A car ploughed into PSG fans in Grenoble in south-east France, leaving four people injured. All those hurt were from the same family, police said. Two were seriously injured. PSG released a statement condemning \"in the strongest possible terms the violence that occurred during the celebrations\". \"These isolated acts are contrary to the club's values and in no way represent the vast majority of our supporters, whose exemplary behaviour throughout the season deserves to be commended,\" the club said. Despite the disorder, a decision was made to go ahead with the victory parade on Sunday. A cap of 100,000 attendees was put on the event. PSG's players made their way to the Elysee Palace after the parade to be greeted by France president Emmanuel Macron. They will close their celebrations with an event for season-ticket holders at the club's Parc des Princes stadium later on Sunday night. Listen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

    "title": "'I'm over knife attack,' says Salman Rushdie",
    "article_text": "Sir Salman Rushdie says he has moved on from the knife attack which has seen his attacker jailed for attempted murder. Hadi Matar, 27, was sentenced to 25 years last month after repeatedly stabbing Sir Salman on a New York lecture stage in 2022. Sir Salman, who has a new book out later this year, told the Hay Festival that an \"important moment\" came for him when he and his wife Eliza \"went back to the scene of the crime to show myself I could stand up where I fell down\". \"It will be nice to talk about fiction again because ever since the attack, really the only thing anybody's wanted to talk about is the attack, but I'm over it.\" Sir Salman recently told Radio 4's Today programme that he was \"pleased\" the man who tried to kill him had received the maximum possible prison sentence. The Midnight's Children and Satanic Verses writer was left with life-changing injuries after the incident - he is now blind in one eye, has damage to his liver and a paralysed hand caused by nerve damage to his arm. Last year, Sir Salman published a book titled Knife reflecting on the event, which he has described as \"my way of fighting back\". The attack came 35 years after Sir Salman's controversial novel The Satanic Verses, which had long made him the target of death threats for its portrayal of the Prophet Muhammad. In November, the author will publish a short story collection, The Eleventh Hour, his first work of fiction to be written since the stabbing. Security was tight for Sir Salman's event, with sniffer dogs present and bag checks leading to a 15-minute delay. He waved at the audience as he entered the stage and humbly gestured to them to stop applauding before joking that: \"I can't see everyone - but I can hear them.\" He said he was feeling \"excellent\" although there \"were bits of me that I'm annoyed about, like not having a right eye. But on the whole, I've been very fortunate and I'm in better shape than maybe I would have expected.\" In a wide-ranging discussion, Sir Salman also touched on US politics, declaring that \"America was not in great shape\". In an apparent reference to President Donald Trump, Sir Salman spoke about \"the moment of hope, that image of Barack and Michelle Obama walking down the mall in DC with the crowds around them... people dancing in the streets in New York. And to go from that to the orange moment that we live in, it's, let's just say, disappointing.\" But he said he was still positive about the future. \"I think I suffer from the optimism disease... I can't help thinking somehow it will be alright.\" Speaking about free speech, he said \"it means tolerating people who say things you don't like\". He recalled a time when a film \"in which I was the villain\", made around the time of the uproar over Satanic Verses, was not classified by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) \"because it was in a hundred ways defamatory\"  but he asked them to allow its release. \"So they gave it a certificate... and nobody went. You know why? Lousy movie. And it taught me a lesson. Let it out and trust the audience. And that's still my view. \"I think we do live in a moment when people are too eager to prohibit speech they disapprove of. That's a very slippery slope\". He warned young people \"to think about it.\" When asked about the effect of AI on authors, Sir Salman said: \"I don't have Chat GPT... I try very hard to pretend it doesn't exist. Someone asked it to write a couple of hundred words like me... it was terrible. And it has no sense of humour.\" Despite being considered one of the greatest living writers, Sir Salman joked that authors \"don't even have that much money... except the two of us (him and host Erica Wagner) and those who write about child wizards... the Taylor Swift of literature,\" referring to JK Rowling. \"Good on her.\" Former US President Bill Clinton and best-selling author James Patterson sat down with the BBC to discuss how real life informed their new political thriller, The First Gentleman. The popular author tells the Hay Festival she would be wary of writing about Beaker in later life. Zadie Smith and Ian McEwan are among 380 writers and groups to call the war a \"genocide\". Author Sir Salman Rushdie says he hopes the man who stabbed him \"reflects upon his deeds\" in jail.

    "title": "Essex Boys killer Michael Steele released from jail",
    "article_text": "A triple murderer infamous for killing the so-called Essex Boys has been released from jail. Michael Steele, now 82, was jailed for life alongside Jack Whomes at the Old Bailey in 1998 for the gangland murders of Tony Tucker, 38, Pat Tate, 37, and Craig Rolfe, 26. The three drug dealers were ambushed and shot dead with a pump action shotgun while in a Range Rover parked in Rettendon, Essex, three years earlier. Steele, who has always denied the murders, has now been released from prison following a decision by the Parole Board, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) confirmed. \"Our thoughts remain with the family and friends of Craig Rolfe, Tony Tucker and Pat Tate,\" a spokesperson for the MoJ told the BBC. \"This decision was made by the independent Parole Board after a thorough risk assessment. \"Michael Steele will be on licence for the rest of his life, with strict conditions and intensive probation supervision.\" Steele's release comes about four years after that of Whomes, previously of Brockford, near Stowmarket, Suffolk, who was released in 2021. The Parole Board first said that Steele would be released on licence in February after a panel ruled imprisonment \"no longer necessary for the protection of the public\". This was temporarily blocked when Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood asked forhis release to be reconsidered,saying the decision was \"legally irrational\". But after a \"thorough\" risk assessment the Parole Board, which had previously been worried about the chances of him reoffending, decided to go ahead with his release. \"He faces an immediate return to prison if he breaks the rules,\" the MoJ warned. The Essex Boys killings, as they became known, were carried out on a snowy December morning on isolated farmland near Chelmsford. Farmer Peter Theobald and his friend Ken Jiggins found the Range Rover parked on a little-known track and suspected the occupants were poachers. But upon further inspection it became clear the trio had been subjected to a brutal killing - the severity of their injuries leaving them only identifiable by their fingerprints. During Steele's trial in 1998, the court heard how the three victims had been ambushed in a row about drugs. Then aged 55, and from Great Bentley, near Colchester, he was found guilty of murder as well as conspiring to import drugs into the UK. His minimum prison term was set at 23 years, which expired in 2019. The case has since been endlessly examined and reconstructed in TV dramas, films, documentaries and books, each exploring its links to other high-profile homicides and the 1990s rave scene. A Sky Documentaries series in 2023 interviewed detectives involved with the 1995 case who were critical of the original police investigation. Former Met Police detective David McKelvey claimed \"credible lines of investigation were not followed\" and that the assassination was related to an armed robbery, not drug dealing. Essex Police previously said the case was \"exhaustively examined\" and there was no fresh evidence to dispute the original verdicts. Follow Essex news onBBC Sounds,Facebook,InstagramandX.

    "article_text": "\"I had a pristine frontage of a middle-class home - no one thought it could happen behind those doors, but it did.\" David Challen successfully campaigned to free his mother, Sally Challen, from prison in 2019,almost nine years after she had killed his father, Richard, with a hammer. She had suffered decades of coercive control by her husband, which David said had become \"normalised\" within the family home in the wealthy suburban village of Claygate in Surrey. David, now a domestic abuse campaigner, has written a book, called The Unthinkable, about the family's experiences, and said more needs to be done to protect victims. Speaking toSunday with Laura Kuenssberg on BBC One, he said: \"She'd done the worst act anyone possibly could do. [She] took away my father. \"I couldn't understand it, but I knew something had been rolling... something was happening and I just didn't have the words.\" A law passed in 2015, which recognises psychological manipulation as a form of domestic abuse, helped secure Mrs Challen's release from prison after she had been jailed for life for murder in 2011. She was freed afterher conviction was quashed in February 2019and prosecutors later accepted her manslaughter plea. Coercive control describes a pattern of behaviour by an abuser to harm, punish or frighten their victim and became a criminal offence in England and Wales in December 2015. David said the description of coercive control had set him and his mother \"free\". \"It gave us a language to describe what was going on in that home, to describe the insidious nature that is mostly non-physical violence,\" he said. Not having a name for the abuse had \"robbed us of our right to have an ability to protect ourselves,\" he added. He now uses his experience of \"intergenerational trauma\" to help others, with a book telling the family's story being released on Thursday. \"I buried my childhood with my father, so I had to dig up the past to find the child I had left behind,\" he said. \"It was the child that I always hid because I didn't know how he experienced that world. \"But I knew I was born into this world with a gut feeling that [there was] something inherently bad about my father, and I never knew why. \"I normalised the coercion and control in my home, this life of servitude that my mother lived under... sexual violence was routine.\" He said he wrote the book to \"give voice to what it's like to grow up in a home where domestic abuse wasn't the word - it was coercive control and it didn't appear on my TV screens\". But, a decade on, \"we're not tackling it enough\", he added. \"I continue to speak out because I don't want these events to happen again.\" A team from the University of Brighton worked with colleagues from Portugal on the study. One-in-four adults in England and Wales have experienced abusive behaviours, official data suggests. Reinaldo Goncalo Bertoni Filho was linked to two 2017 attacks in Surrey through DNA from the scenes. William Chalkley, 20, was described by police as a \"dangerous offender\". Three women have bravely shared their story after being abused by convicted murderer Kieron Goodwin.",

    "title": "Verstappen 'let himself down' with Russell collision",
    "article_text": "Max Verstappen is 49 points behind championship leader Oscar Piastri after nine races George Russell said Max Verstappen \"let himself down\" by appearing to drive deliberately into his Mercedes during the Spanish Grand Prix. Red Bull's Verstappen received a 10-second penalty for the incident following the collision with the Briton's car. It dropped the Dutchman from fifth to 10th in the final result, leaving him 49 points behind championship leader Oscar Piastri of McLaren, who won the race from team-mate Lando Norris. Russell said: \"Totally unnecessary and sort of lets him down. I don't know what he was thinking. \"It doesn't really make sense to deliberately crash into somebody and risk damaging your own car, risk a penalty. \"In the end, I'm not going to lose sleep over it because I ultimately benefited from those antics.\" Verstappen responded that he would \"bring some tissues next time\", adding: \"He has his view, I have my view.\" He was reluctant to discuss the incident in detail, but he did say that it was \"a misjudgement\". He was also given three penalty points on his licence. That takes him to 11, one short of a race ban. So he will have to keep his nose clean over the next two races in Canada and Austria, after which some points come off because they go beyond their year's expiry, if he is not to be forced to sit out a Grand Prix. Piastri wins Spanish GP as Verstappen penalised Spanish Grand Prix Review In the clash at Turn Five, stewards decided Verstappen had \"significantly reduced (his) speed thereby appearing to allow [Russell] to overtake\" but that once Russell was ahead Verstappen \"suddenly accelerated and collided with [Russell]\". Russell said: \"You cannot deliberately crash into another driver. You know, we're putting our lives on the line. We're fortunate the cars are as safe as they are these days. But we shouldn't take it for granted. \"It's down to the stewards to determine if it's deliberate or not. If they do think it's deliberate, then they need to have a hard precedent. \"Max is such an amazing driver and so many people look up to him. It's a shame that something like that continues to occur.\" Verstappen, who did surrender the position later in the same lap, said he had no regrets about his conduct. \"In life you shouldn't regret too many things,\" he said. \"You only live once.\" Piastri said: \"I need a bit more context on what happened [before commenting], but obviously it was not exactly a small touch. I don't have that much more, but it obviously didn't look great. The stewards decided to take no further action over the contact involving Charles Leclerc and Max Verstappen Verstappen and Russell crossed swords during an extraordinary final five laps after a late safety car. Until then, Verstappen had been on course for a strong third place, after challenging the McLarens on a three-stop strategy, compared to their two. When the safety car was deployed, all the leaders - and most of the rest of the field - pitted for fresh soft tyres. But because of their three-stop strategy, Red Bull's choices were limited. They had to choose between leaving Verstappen out on his soft tyres, on which he had done eight racing laps; or pitting, for either another set of softs that had done one qualifying lap and the in- and out-laps, some practice starts, and the laps to the grid, or a new set of the hard-compound tyres. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner admitted that in hindsight, the best choice would have been to leave him out. This would have put Verstappen in the lead. He would almost certainly have lost out to the McLaren drivers and perhaps Ferrari's Charles Leclerc but that would have left him fourth, one place better than he finished on the road before his penalty. Instead, Red Bull brought him for the fresh hard tyres, which most teams avoided throughout the weekend. Verstappen questioned the decision upon returning to the track, and then nearly lost control in a massive moment on the exit of the final corner on the restart as he fought to keep pace with the cars on grippier tyres around him. He was immediately passed by Leclerc on the straight, the two cars lightly touching as their trajectories converged, and then by Russell into the first corner, where they banged wheels. Verstappen accused Russell of barging him off the track, and was also upset about the Leclerc incident. But after stewards launched an investigation into him leaving the track and gaining an advantage, Red Bull decided to ask him to let Russell by, to avoid a penalty. Horner admitted Verstappen was \"obviously upset and annoyed\" and \"frustrated\" but said they would discuss the matter internally. Verstappen said that he felt the \"biggest issue\" was with F1's racing guidelines. \"What is allowed, what isn't, is not very natural,\" Verstappen said. \"And that is quite frustrating. And of course, sometimes it works for you, sometimes it works against you, and today that worked against me.\" According to the guidelines, Russell was entitled to the corner, because he was more or less completely alongside Verstappen - the rules say that a driver overtaking on the inside has to have his car's front axle at least level with the wing mirror of the one on the outside to be given space. Stewards took no further action over the incident with Leclerc on the straight because \"both cars were moving slightly towards each other in the middle of the track and a minor collision occurred as a result. \"Both drivers were of the view that this was an avoidable collision and could potentially have resulted in a major crash but neither driver was wholly or predominantly to blame.\" Leclerc said: \"Max wanted to bring me towards the inside where there's all the [torn-up used tyre] rubber, so I didn't want to go too much there. So, I was trying to push him to the left. There was a little bit of contact but, fortunately for us, no consequences.\" Verstappen has won two races this season - in Japan and Imola This is not the first time Verstappen and Russell have been involved in controversy. Theyhad a major row,and exchanged public insults, after the Qatar Grand Prix last year. That was over an incident in which Verstappen felt Russell had overplayed his hand with the stewards in seeking a penalty for his rival after an incident in qualifying. Before that, there was a clash during the 2022 Azerbaijan Grand Prix, after which they again insulted each other publicly. On Sunday, Verstappen said he had no interest in discussing the incident with Russell. \"I have nothing to say,\" he said. And it's not the first time Verstappen has appeared to let his emotions get the better of him in the car - in last year's Mexico City Grand Prix,he was given two separate 10-second penaltiesfor two incidents on the same lap with Norris. After that, he also did not want to discuss the incidents with the media. In these situations, it seems Verstappen's competitive instinct - which is intense - clouds his judgement, and overrides his usual desire to maximise every result. Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said: \"The great ones, whether it's in motor racing or in other sports, you just need to have the world against you and perform at the highest possible level. \"That's why sometimes these greats don't recognise that actually the world is not against you, it's just you who has made a mistake or you've screwed up.\" This incident could have significant consequences for Verstappen's season. He was already fighting a difficult battle against two drivers performing strongly in a McLaren that has a higher average performance ceiling than the Red Bull, even if Verstappen has been able to challenge them on certain types of circuits. Until now, he has been staying in touch by maximising his results, including two superb victories, in Japan and at Imola. The Suzuka win was founded on a breathtaking pole lap, perhaps one of the greatest ever, and the second onan overtaking move on Piastri into the first cornerthat Russell, in the midst of his criticisms of Verstappen after the Spanish race, called \"one of the best moves that we've all seen in a long time\". That had limited Verstappen's deficit in the championship to 22 points heading to Spain. Even so, when he arrived in Barcelona, he said the championship \"doesn't really feel like a fight\". Now, he has taken an action, influenced by a set of circumstances not all of which were in his control, that has made that more of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Verstappen's response to that? \"I never said that I was in the championship fight, first of all,\" he said. \"Every race so far, it's been tough. When they get their things right, they're unbeatable. That's quite clear this season.\"",

    "title": "Root 'getting better with age' - the numbers behind his ODI brilliance",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played Root's 'fantastic innings' as England claim series win England captain Harry Brook's assessment that Joe Root \"is only getting better with age\" is likely to send shivers down the spines of bowlers all around the world. Root surpassed World Cup-winning captain Eoin Morgan to become England's leading run-scorer in one-day internationals during hisepic 166 not outagainst West Indies in Cardiff, a title he also holds in Tests. He came to the crease in the first over, and withstood all of West Indies' pressure when England were on the ropes at 133-5 in pursuit of 309 to win. A 98-ball century was raised having barely broken a sweat, reaching it in style with a six and a four, before the Yorkshireman glided into the next gear in his stand of 143 with Will Jacks which saw the helpless bowlers at his mercy. \"He's unbelievable and he's only getting better with age as well,\" said Brook, who made 47 and added a counter-attacking 85 for the third wicket with Root, who stayed in his skipper's slipstream in a perfectly paced knock. \"He's someone I look up to, he's such an amazing player, such an amazing bloke. He works the hardest out of anyone I've seen. \"Nothing's ever right and he's always trying to get better - he's the perfect role model for any young cricketer out there.\" Upon reaching 42, Root bettered Morgan's tally of 6,957 runs and with typical modesty said it felt like \"a sign of getting old\" when asked about what the milestone meant - before adding there is plenty more in the tank as far as his future in the format is concerned, though he is still some way from reaching Sachin Tendulkar's record of 18,426. \"Until that desire, that want to turn up and get better every day and add to the group â the want to be not out at the end of a chase like that â when that's not a burning desire for me any more, it'll be time to stop,\" said 34-year-old Root. \"But that's not the case at the moment and doesn't feel like it's anywhere near the case. I will keep just trying to do my part in helping us win games and hopefully win series.\" Much of the second ODI belonged to West Indies: England spilled three catches inside the first 20 overs, missed two run out chances and then Jamie Smith, Ben Duckett and Jos Buttler all made ducks in the chase. But Root's class prevailed, his 18th ODI century almost certainly one of his finest. \"We are running out of things to say, he's just on this constant journey of ticking everything off before him,\" former England fast bowler Steven Finn told BBC Test Match Special. \"Now he's head and shoulders above the rest and the innings he played today signified his position in that. \"He was so determined to be there at the end and the way he read the situation, soaked up pressure, saw people fall around him - West Indies had no answer.\" This illustration of WinViz over time shows how Root calmly soaked up the pressure and gradually inched England into a winning position against West Indies in the second ODI Root's sparkling 166* steers England to series win Root masterclass sees England win thriller Analysis by CricViz analyst Soham Sarkhel Ticking the strike over Since his debut in ODIs, only two batters have a higher non-boundary strike-rate than Root (minimum of 2,000 non-boundary runs). Off non-boundary balls, Root has a strike-rate of 59.89, England's Jos Buttler is second with 63.77 and at the top is South Africa's AB de Villiers (65.70). High control Since the start of 2018, Root has a false-shot percentage of only 11.1% in ODIs. In matches between Full Member nations, only one batter in world cricket has a lower false-shot percentage than Root - New Zealand's Kane Williamson (11%). Great against spin Root averages 70.3 against spin in his ODI career - the next highest English batter is Buttler (52). In ODI history, only five batters average higher against spin than Root for a minimum of 1,500 runs - Mike Hussey (Australia), MS Dhoni (India), Michael Bevan (Australia), Shai Hope (West Indies) and Babar Azam (Pakistan). Of these, only Dhoni has scored more runs against spin than Root, while none of them have scored at a higher strike-rate than Root's 90. Scores runs off good balls In his ODI career, Root averages 47.7 against deliveries in the channel outside off stump and scores at a strike-rate of 77 against them. The average right-handed batter averages only 33 on this line. When the ball is wider than that, Root cashes in on the width, scoring at an average of 94.5 and striking at 109. Master of the middle overs Between overs 11-40, Root averages 66.6 at a strike rate of 87. Only two batters in world cricket have scored at an average and a strike-rate higher than Root's for a minimum of 2,000 runs â India's Virat Kohli (ave 70.7, S/R 93) and De Villiers (ave 68.9, S/R 97). Always evolving In ODIs until the end of 2015, Root had seven dismissals playing the reverse sweep at an average of just 7.4. Since the start of 2016, he has averaged 158 with the shot. Previously, he used to reach out well in front while playing the reverse sweep, with an average interception point of 2.10m from the stumps. Since the start of 2016, that has come much closer at 1.77m. Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "Not redemption but release - how Yates finally conquered the Giro",
    "article_text": "Simon Yates kisses the Giro d'Italia trophy on Sunday, wearing the leader's pink jersey Simon Yates loves the Giro d'Italia but he could have been forgiven for hating it. Even in a sport synonymous with suffering, this Grand Tour has inflicted unusual punishment on Yates over the years. The British rider looked set to win at his first attempt in 2018, only to dramatically crack two days from Rome. Illness, injury and indifferent form plagued his attempts over the next four years. He returned for this edition, after two years away, a contender, but not widely considered one of the pre-race favourites. Perhaps absence made his heart grow fonder; the Englishman's determination to conquer this beautiful yet brutal race steelier. After quietly keeping himself in contention, Yates' audacious attack on stage 20 saw him seize the maglia rosa - the leader's jersey - for the first time since that 2018 collapse. On Sunday in Rome, he rolled across the line in pink, sealing his second Grand Tour title after the 2018 Vuelta a Espana. Yates' tumultuous love affair with the Giro has its happy ending. Britain's Yates seals first Giro title in Rome Yates set for Giro title after stunning penultimate stage The tears tumbled from Yates as soon as he crossed the line in Sestriere on Saturday and continued to fall throughout his post-stage interviews. \"I've really invested a lot of my career and my life into targeting this race, and there've been a lot of setbacks,\" said the usually stoic 32-year-old when he could finally speak. Setbacks is an understatement. An underwhelming eighth in 2019. Forced to withdraw after contracting Covid-19 in 2020. A difficult fortnight in 2021 before a strong final week to finish third. Sustaining a knee injury in a crash early on in 2022 that ultimately forced him to abandon. That first year still cut the deepest though. In 2018, he held the leader's jersey for 13 days, won three stages, but on stage 19 fell from first to 18th overall as compatriot Chris Froome pulled off a staggering comeback on his way to his first and only Giro title. Yates ended up finishing 21st. How fitting it was on the same climb Yates crumbled on seven years ago - the Colle delle Finestre - that he saw his window and rode away from rivals Isaac del Toro and Richard Carapaz to glory. Afterwards, Yates revealed he had privately been targeting the climb since the route was announced, wanting to \"close that chapter\" from 2018, despite not having ridden it since. Even then, Yates thought it would be for a stage win, rather than for the pink jersey. He did not draw attention to his aim and Yates' return to the Finestre was not the dominant narrative before stage 20. The focus was on a showdown between leader Del Toro and second-placed Carapaz. And it helped free Yates to ride away. Visma won three stages in the 2025 Giro as well as the overall title Having resisted the allure of Team Sky when he turned professional in 2014, Bury-born Yates and twin brother Adam joined Australian outfit OricaâGreenEdge. Adam left at the end of 2020, but Simon remained with the team, now called JaycoâAlUla, until the end of last season, taking a pay cut to join Visma-Lease a Bike. Visma's experience of winning Grand Tours has proved vital for Yates. The Dutch team have won four Vueltas, two Tours de France and now two Giros since 2019. Putting generational talent Wout van Aert up the road to help Yates bury his rivals on the final climb on Saturday was masterful. It had not all been heartbreak for Yates at the Giro. He won six individual stages from 2018 to 2022, often in swashbuckling style. This year was different. He quietly went about his business before striking at the ideal moment. Yates did not place higher than third on any stage and did not enter the top 10 overall until stage seven. He is the first Giro winner since Alberto Contador in 2015 not to also win a stage. Yates moved up to second on stage 14 and, though he slipped back to third on stage 17, his measured approach appeared to be paying off, with 2019 champion Carapaz left to do most of the attacking. Then came stage 19. Yates lost more time and was visibly annoyed at the finish, saying his team had not raced to the agreed plan. He went into the penultimate stage one minute 21 seconds down on Del Toro. That sense of 'not again' that engulfed Rory McIlroy's final round at this year's Masters was palpable. It seemed Yates' chance had gone. Even Adam was against him, riding in support of UAE Team Emirates-XRG team-mate Del Toro. But Yates showed maturity by apologising to his team before the start on Saturday, admitting he was just disappointed at his own performance, before channelling that frustration as Visma's plan worked perfectly. Dropping to third probably helped him in the end, with Del Toro and Carapaz marking each other somewhat bafflingly as Yates went clear. Regardless of their tactics, Yates was the strongest and smartest when it mattered most. Yates' partner missed her initial flight to Italy on Saturday because she was watching him race on TV but joined him for the celebrations in Rome on Sunday Like McIlroy, Yates sobbed before the smile arrived when he knew he had finally won the title he wanted most. He had a broad grin in Rome, but was also perceptive about what he has achieved. \"A lot of people can resonate with the story, losing the race a long time ago now, in 2018,\" he said before the final stage. \"The way I've managed to take it, I really think it's touched a lot of people.\" He is set to ride this year's Tour in support of team-mate Jonas Vingegaard, who is bidding for a third title, with Yates possibly able to target stage wins too. Perhaps this victory will free him up to win more Grand Tours. Perhaps it won't. There will be a lot of talk of redemption but Yates had not shamed himself in failing to win the Giro before. Misfortune and stronger competitors had defeated him. How poetic this year gave him the chance to complete the circle of his Giro story. As Yates said: \"Life comes around, it gives and it takes.\" This is not redemption but release. Relief. Rejoice.

    "title": "'Are you getting ready for UFC?' How super-fit Draper intimidates Bublik",
    "article_text": "Jack Draper has beaten Alexander Bublik in both their previous ATP Tour meetings French Open 2025 Dates:25 May-8 JuneVenue:Roland Garros Coverage:Live radio commentaries across 5 Live Sport and BBC Sounds, plus live text commentaries on the BBC Sport website and app \"Last year the guy is 40 in the world, this year he is top four, that's a crazy achievement.\" Alexander Bublik is certainly not the first to take notice. Jack Draper has been turning heads all year. The British number one's rise has been impossible to ignore. Draper has surged up the rankings in the past 12 months after following up a run to the US Open semi-finals last year with a series of impressive results in 2025, including claiming hisfirst ATP Masters title at Indian Wells. Having progressed to the fourth round at French Open, Bublik is the next to try and stop the soon-to-be world number four. \"Jack, for me, is insane,\" said Bublik. \"I saw him first day here. I'm like, are you getting ready for UFC? \"How can I beat him? I don't know. I will just go there, enjoy the time, show what I'm capable of showing.\" How have British men improved on clay? Draper outclasses rising star Fonseca at French Open 'Angry' Alcaraz beats Shelton to reach quarters In 23-year-old Draper, British tennis fans believe they may just have found their next serial Grand Slam contender. British former world number four Tim Henman told BBC Sport recently that Draper's best attributes - his left-handed serve and crunching forehand -could \"work on any surface\". Prior to this year, though, Draper had never won a match at the clay-court major with most of his success coming on hard courts or grass. However, he has made huge strides on the surface this season and reached his first clay final in Madrid in April. Managing to avoid the injuries that have plagued him in the past has enabled Draper to reach a significantly higher level of fitness, which has been key to his improvement on the slower surface. Now just the world number 62 stands between him and another Grand Slam quarter-final. And while Draper has enjoyed the best year of his career, Bublik fell from a high of 17th in the rankings in 2024 to as low as 82nd in March. That prompted a radical change of approach that led to the Kazakh taking a trip to Las Vegas that month to blow off some steam. \"My fall was not linked with lack of attitude and lack of practising,\" he said. \"It was the exact opposite. I just burned out because I was waiting for the results to come. \"I was like, if I practise more, if I hit better forehands, it will come. It didn't, and then I got to the point of 'OK, why am I sacrificing so much? For what?'\" Asked if the trip to Nevada was a training trip, Bublik added: \"No, Vegas, Vegas, like a hangover thing Vegas. \"It was a good three days. I had just let it all out. I said, I'm useless now, I can't win a match, so let it be, let's see how it goes.\" It worked as Bublik won his next event, the Challenger tournament in Phoenix, Arizona, having arrived from Vegas three hours before his first match. He also triumphed on clay in Turin last month. The 27-year-old is slowly climbing the rankings again - but Draper will be keen to ensure a first Grand Slam quarter-final appearance has to wait. Norrie beats Fearnley after firework disruption 'Like I was playing Sinner' - Swiatek battles to beat Rybakina Players voice burnout fears over tennis schedule Cameron Norrie faces three-time champion Novak Djokovic for a place in the French Open quarter-finals For the first time since 1963, two British men have reached the fourth round at Roland Garros. Cameron Norrie is the other after victory over compatriot Jacob Fearnley set up a last-16 clash with 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic on Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday. World number 81 Norrie has struggled through a tough couple of years having risen to as high as eighth in the world in 2022. But the win over Fearnley means Norrie, 29, has now reached the fourth round at every Slam. \"To make the second week for the first time is so, so good and at a time where I was not really stringing a lot of matches and a lot of wins together,\" he said. \"I was able to build from the momentum that I've really struggled to get from the last year and a half, for different reasons. \"I've just been enjoying my tennis, and I think I wanted to do that again.

    "title": "The spark to reinvigorate Man Utd? How Cunha fits Amorim's plans",
    "article_text": "The spark to reinvigorate Man Utd? How Cunha fits Amorim's plans A humbling Europa League final defeat. A historically dreadful Premier League campaign. A still-new head coach who isn't afraid to point out publicly how low Manchester United have fallen. It would be fair to say one of the world's biggest clubs is broken and on its knees. This summer's transfer window is one of the most important in United history. If they are to avoid another failed reboot, they can't afford any mistakes. They must give Ruben Amorim the best resources possible to succeed in the 3-4-3/3-5-2 system he is adamant about playing. So where do you start? Well, you could do worse than sign Matheus Cunha, Wolverhampton Wanderers' best player of the season just gone. United need to address the goalscoring issues that date back to Erik ten Hag's tenure. Over the past season, United outscored only four Premier League teams - the bottom three and Everton. The season before that, they were the joint-lowest scorers in the top half of the table. While goalscoring is one thing Cunha will bring to Old Trafford - with 40 goal involvements in the past two seasons - he also directly addresses other problems United have. Man Utd confirm deal for Wolves' Cunha It will help Amorim that Cunha has played in a Wolves team that predominantly used a back three system both under Gary O'Neil and Vitor Pereira. You can see him slotting in United's front three, particularly getting minutes in the left-sided 10 position. The United shirt appears to have become a burden in recent years, with a number of players going on to flourish elsewhere - see Scott McTominay's dancing in Naples as an example. But United fans can be encouraged by the fact Cunha welcomed the responsibility at Wolves for goalscoring and conjuring up chances seemingly from nothing. Cunha became talismanic at Wolves, helping the club avoid the drop twice - with many significant contributions. Take, for instance, the first of Cunha's two goals in a 2-2 draw at Nottingham Forest in April 2024. The Brazilian dribbled from the corner of the penalty area, sucked two Forest defenders in before rounding them and unleashing a shot into the top corner. Creating a chance where there wasn't one, with fearlessness. Manchester United's attack has become too predictable. They pass it around the back three, before the wing-backs and midfielders are marked, leaving no choice but to go long to the striker. Often the long pass is played up to Rasmus Hojlund, who isn't the best at holding the ball up, resulting in a turnover. United don't have players capable of taking the ball and doing something with it. Only Amad Diallo and Alejandro Garnacho - who is likely to leave - possess the quality to run and drive at defenders, with the ability to create a chance using their initiative in a rigid system. Cunha's signing changes that. Since Amorim's arrival, there haven't been many games where you could say his style of play has worked. A key reason for this is the lack of ball carriers in the team. Kobbie Mainoo alone was enough under Ten Hag. He could take the ball on the half-turn from defence and drive up the pitch. But Mainoo found minutes hard to come by in 2024-25. United need a player brave enough to get the ball from defence into attack and the stats indicate that could be Cunha. The former Atletico Madrid forward's ability to carry the ball often results in a chance created. But the important thing about the Brazilian's ball-carrying ability is how deep he likes to drop to get possession. That opens up possibilities for his new club. United's central midfield are frequently suffocated by the press, forcing them to pass it backwards to the back three. The job of both of the number 10s on either side of the main striker is to drop deep for the ball and use their movement to drag an opposing defender out of position. Cunha can drop deep to receive the ball, wriggle free of challenges and dart into the half-spaces. This creates space behind the defender who has been pulled out of position. As Cunha showed at Wolves, after receiving the ball from defence. he can release an overlapping full-back wide to cross. Similarly, Cunha can pull wider to receive the ball, allowing other players to occupy the half-space to confuse the opposition. And he is unperturbed by players attempting to get the ball from him, even when they hunt in packs. This video can not be played Matheus Cunha talks Wolves, Brazil and his âIdolâ Ronaldinho Those qualities will suit Amorim's style - as the danger is supposed to come from the movement of the full-backs, either out wide or underlapping. They can take advantage as Cunha attracts players towards him. Last December as Wolves defeated Manchester United 2-0, Cunha scored directly from a corner in a game where Amorim's side were completely outfought. It was a cheeky goal, showing just what Cunha is capable of. His flair, intelligence and ability to grab games by the scruff of the neck are qualities United's flat attack need desperately. While he can be a fiery character similar to Wayne Rooney in his younger days, he could provide vital spark at Old Trafford.

But he double-bogeyed the 17th to ease the pressure on his rival, who went on seal his third win from his previous four tournaments. The victory follows his triumph in the PGA Championship in May,  Scheffler's third major win. He dropped just one shot in his final round when he bogeyed the 10th hole, but made birdies on the seventh, 11th and 15th.

    "article_text": "James Anderson's previous T20 Blast appearance for Lancashire was in the 2014 final - a gap of 3,935 days - when he took 0-52 against Birmingham Bears James Anderson marked his first T20 Blast game for almost 11 years with a career-best 3-17 and a catch asLancashire Lightning beat Durhamin a thrilling final-ball finish. The ex-England paceman helped restrict Durham to 150-6, and with the scores level, Jack Blatherwick hit the final ball for a single as Lancashire won by four wickets. Elsewhere in the North Group,Northants Steelbacks earned their second winby beating Leicestershire Foxes by five wickets, and Brett D'Oliveira's 79 ledWorcestershire to a 60-run win over Yorkshireat New Road. In South Group, leg-spinner Mason Crane claimed 4-28 asGlamorgan beat Middlesexby five wickets in their first game, andSomerset also won, beating Essex by eight wickets, but holders Gloucestershire were bowled out for 93 as theylost to Sussexby 80 runs. Match scorecards All eyes were on Test cricket's leading pace wicket-taker at the Riverside as Anderson was handed the ball for the opening over of the game. It was a tidy one, yielding just three runs, and he then had Graham Clark caught at mid-off, Alex Lees taken at mid-on, and Colin Ackermann dropped at mid-wicket by Tom Aspinwall in an opening burst of 2-15 from three overs. Anderson, who wasknighted in April, returned for the 11th over of the innings and picked up the wicket of Ackermann - his spell including 16 dot balls - before catching Ben Raine at fine leg. New Zealander Jimmy Neesham (40 not out off 25 balls) boosted the Durham total  and they then picked up a couple of early wickets at the start of Lancashire's chase. The visitors struggled to 80-4 in the 12th over but Michael Jones made 55 off 39 balls, including a six through the rear window of a vehicle in the car park, and Josh Bohannon a well-judged 31. Bohannon was caught and bowled by Neesham from the fifth ball of the final over, but Blatherwick came out to win the game and earn Lancashire their third win out of three. Northants Steelbacks' Ben Sanderson dismisses Leicestershire's Ben Cox at Wantage Road Three-time winners Leicestershire lost two wickets in the first over, bowled byNorthants Steelbacksskipper David Willey, and found themselves 39-7 in the eighth over as Ben Sanderson produced a superb spell of 4-15. It looked like the Foxes might fail to reach their lowest T20 score of 89 all out against Derbyshire in 2022, but Logan van Beek's 42 enabled them to bat out the full 20 overs for 122 all out. Northants were 75-4 in the 14th over of their reply - but Ravi Bopara's unbeaten 46 off 40 balls took them home by five wickets with four balls to spare. At New Road,Worcestershire Rapids'skipper D'Oliveira made his highest T20 score, hitting four sixes in his 79 off 48 balls against Yorkshire after being dropped early in his innings by Dom Bess. D'Oliveira put on 117 with Adam Hose, who contributed 54 off 37, before holing out off Australian Will Sutherland in their 201-5. Yorkshire captain Dawid Malan, by contrast, was bowled second ball for a duck by Jacob Duffy (2-30) and wickets continued to fall regularly with Adam Finch (2-19) running out James Wharton by kicking the ball on to the stumps. Bess made 41 not out off 37 balls but Yorkshire were well short of their target on 135-8 when rain ended play with three balls left and they lost by 60 runs via the DLS method. Mason Crane joined Glamorgan from Hampshire on a three-year contract last summer after impressing in a loan spell Glamorganmade a winning start in this summer's competition as figures of 4-28 by leg-spinner Mason Crane set up a five-wicket victory over Middlesex at Merchant Taylors' School. The home side went into decline following an opening stand of 45 between Stevie Eskinazi and Kane Williamson, the latter run out for 25 by Hayden Kerr's direct hit at the bowler's end. That proved to be the best score in a disappointing Middlesex total of 124-9, but their bowlers made Glamorgan work for the win, reducing them to 64-5 before an unbroken stand of 64 between Asa Tribe (40 not out) and Daniel Douthwaite (31) saw them home on 128-5 after 15.3 overs. \"It is a bit of a mystery when you come to an outground in terms of knowing what you are going to get, but there was a little bit there so I was  pretty happy with that,\" Crane said. Will Smeed played arguably the innings of the day for last year's runners-upSomerset, hitting a six and 11 fours in his 81 not out off 54 balls as they cruised to an eight-wicket win over Essex at Chelmsford. After coming together when a brilliant one-handed boundary catch by Thomas Rew removed Paul Walter, Dean Elgar (50) and Matt Critchley (54) shared a fourth-wicket stand of 83 for the home side, but from 119-3, they lost seven wickets for 29 runs to be all out for 148. An opening partnership of 96 in nine overs between Smeed and Tom Lammonby (36) put Somerset on course for victory and they reached 149-2 from the penultimate ball of the 16th over. HoldersGloucestershiresuffered their second defeat as their batting let them down against Sussex Sharks at Hove. David Payne, the top wicket-taker in the 2024 Blast, and Matt Taylor claimed three victims each as Sussex were bowled out for 173 despite Tom Alsop (58 off 35 balls) and James Coles (43 off 27) putting on 105 together. But Ollie Robinson bowled Cameron Bancroft for seven with a beautiful leg-cutter early in Gloucestershire's reply and the visitors lost their way as Tymal Mills took 3-13 and were dismissed in the 14th over.

    "title": "UK swings behind Morocco’s autonomy proposal for Western Sahara",
    "article_text": "The UK has thrown its weight behind Morocco’s autonomy proposal forWestern Sahara, marking a shift in Britain’s position on one of Africa’s longest-running territorial disputes. Speaking during a visit to Rabat on Sunday, the foreign secretary,David Lammy, said Britain considered Morocco’s 2007 autonomy proposal “the most credible, viable and pragmatic basis” for resolving the dispute. The UK has previously said the status of the disputed territory in north-west Africa remains “undetermined”, while supporting “self-determination” for “the people of Western Sahara”. The disputed region has a population of about 600,000 people, and is considered a non-self-governing territory by the UN. WhileMoroccocontrols most of the territory, the Algerian-backed Polisario Front controls land in the east of the territory and wants full independence from Rabat. Under Morocco’s autonomy plan, Western Sahara would remain under Rabat’s sovereignty but with a degree of self-rule. The US recognised Morocco’s claim over Western Sahara in 2020 during Trump’s first administration. France followed suit last year, along with Spain in 2021. “The UK will continue to act bilaterally, including economically, regionally and internationally in line with this position to support the resolution of the conflict,” Lammy said after talks with his Moroccan counterpart, Nasser Bourita. The region has been contested since 1975, when Spain withdrew from its former colony, sparking a conflict between Morocco and the pro-independence Polisario Front. A UN-brokered ceasefire was reached in 1991, with promises of a referendum on the territory’s future that has never materialised. Talks have since stalled, and in 2020 the Polisario declared the truce over, accusing Morocco of violating its terms. Algeria, a key regional player, has previously criticised Rabat’s plan and US support for the proposals. Bourita described the UK’s endorsement as part of “a momentum to speed up the solution of the conflict”. He said British investments in Western Sahara were under discussion. The two countries also signed cooperation deals on healthcare, innovation, ports, water infrastructure and procurement. Lammy said the partnerships would allow “British businesses to score big on football’s biggest stage”, a reference to Morocco’s preparations to co-host the 2030 World Cup alongside Spain and Portugal. The UN still officially supports a negotiated solution that would allow the people of Western Sahara to decide whether to become independent or remain part of Morocco.",

    "title": "Thousands evacuated in three Canadian provinces as wildfires continue",
    "article_text": "More than 25,000 residents in three provinces have been evacuated as dozens of wildfires remain active and affect air quality in parts ofCanadaand the US, according to officials. Most of the evacuated residents were from Manitoba, which declared a state of emergency last week. About 17,000 people there were evacuated by Saturday, along with 1,300 in Alberta. About 8,000 people in Saskatchewan had been relocated as leaders there said the number could climb. Smoke was reducing air quality and reducing visibility in Canada and into some US states along the border on Sunday. The Saskatchewan public safety agency said on Sunday: “Air quality and visibility due to wildfire smoke can fluctuate over short distances and can vary considerably from hour to hour. As smoke levels increase, health risks increase.” Scott Moe, the premier of Saskatchewan, said hot, dry weather was allowing some fires to grow and threaten communities, and resources to fight the fires and support the evacuees were stretched thin. He said at a news conference on Saturday: “The next four to seven days are absolutely critical until we can find our way to changing weather patterns, and ultimately a soaking rain throughout the north.” In Manitoba, more than 5,000 of those evacuated are from Flin Flon, located nearly 400 miles (645km) north-west of the provincial capital of Winnipeg. In northern Manitoba, fire knocked out power to the community of Cranberry Portage, forcing a mandatory evacuation order on Saturday for about 600 residents. The fire raging through Flin Flon began a week ago near Creighton, Saskatchewan, and quickly jumped the boundary into Manitoba. Crews have struggled to contain it. Water bombers have been intermittently grounded due to heavy smoke and a drone incursion. The US Department of Agriculture’s forest service deployed an air tanker to Alberta and said it would send 150 firefighters and equipment to Canada. In some parts of the US, air quality reached “unhealthy” levels on Sunday in North Dakota and small swaths of Montana, Minnesota and South Dakota, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency’s AirNow page. Bryan Jackson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in the US, said: “We should expect at least a couple more rounds of Canadian smoke to come through the US over the next week.” Separately, a fire in the US border state of Idaho burned at least 40 hectares (100 acres) as of Sunday, prompting road closures and some evacuations, according to the Idaho Department of Lands. The agency said in a news release that at least one structure had been burned, but did not provide additional details about the damage. Strong gusty winds of 15-20 mphand steep terrain were making it difficult for firefighters battling the fire, which began on Saturday. Evacuation centres have opened across Manitoba for those fleeing the fires, one as far south as Winkler, 12 miles from the US border. Winnipeg opened up public buildings for evacuees as it deals with hotels already crammed with other fire refugees, vacationers, businesspeople and convention-goers. Manitoba’s Indigenous leaders said on Saturday at a news conference that hotel rooms in the cities where evacuees were arriving were full. They called on the government to instruct hotel owners to prioritise evacuees. Grand Chief Kyra Wilson of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs said it was one of the largest evacuations in the province since the 1990s. She said at a news conference: “It’s really sad to see our children having to sleep on floors. People are sitting, waiting in hallways, waiting outside, and right now we just need people to come together. People are tired.” Canada’s wildfire season runs from May to September. Its worst ever wildfire season was in 2023, which choked much of North America with dangerous smoke for months.",

    "title": "Brazil: outcry after funk singer arrested for allegedly inciting crime in lyrics",
    "article_text": "The arrest of a well-known Brazilian funk singer on charges of allegedly inciting crime in his lyrics and an alleged connection to a major criminal gang has sparked outrage among artists, intellectuals and legal experts. MC Poze do Rodo, 26, who has 5.8 million monthly listeners on Spotify, wasarrested early on Thursday at his homein a luxury condominium in Rio de Janeiro’s west zone. Outcry has focused on the way the artist was detained over alleged non-violent offences: handcuffed, shirtless and barefoot.Footage of the arrestwas broadcast repeatedly on television and splashed across the front pages of Brazilian newspapers. “This is persecution [against me],” the funk singer told journalists as he was transferred from the police station to jail. “There is no evidence.” Activists say the case is the latest example of thecriminalisation of funk music– and, by extension, of Black culture; something researchers argue has been a systemic feature of Brazilian society since the abolition of slavery in 1888. Like most Brazilian funk artists, MC Poze – born Marlon Brendon Coelho Couto da Silva – is Black and raised in afavela. He rose to prominence in 2019 and has since succeeded with songs depicting daily life in those communities, including some tracks that openly reference drug trafficking. In an interview with TV Globo last year, he admitted that as a teenager,he had worked for the drug trade: “I’ve been in shootouts, I was shot, and I was arrested too.” But he insisted he had left that life behind and that his goal was to send young people the message that “crime doesn’t lead anywhere”. Last Thursday, police justified his arrest by claiming he was “clearly glorifying drug trafficking and the illegal use of firearms” in his lyrics, and that his concerts were being financed by one of Brazil’s two main criminal gangs,the Comando Vermelho (Red Command). The police chief, Felipe Curi, even claimed that MC Poze’s lyrics were “often far more damagingthan a rifle shot fired by a drug trafficker”. According to Pierpaolo Cruz Bottini, professor of criminal law at the University of São Paulo, there is no incitement to crime in MC Poze’s songs. “There is no intent to promote or defend criminal acts – rather, the songs paint a vivid picture of a reality everyone is already aware of.” Bottini said that the way the singer was detained – without being allowed to get dressed or even put on shoes – was “completely inappropriate”. “Even in cases of violent crimes, such treatment would only be justified if there were signs of resistance or a risk of flight – and that clearly wasn’t the case,” he said. After the arrest, other funk artists took to social media to protest in solidarity. Another high-profile singer, MC Cabelinho,pointed outthat when an actor in soap opera or a film portrays a character involved in drug trafficking, it is not seen as inciting crime. According to anthropologist Mylene Mizrahi, a professor at Rio’s PUC university, funk artists are still not considered legitimate artists. “They are pop artists, just like US rappers or Hollywood film-makers. But when someone like Martin Scorsese makes a mafia film, they’re not branded mobsters,” she said. The lawyer Joel Luiz Costa, executive director of the Black Population Defence Institute, said: “The criminalisation of funk is part of a long historical process that began after the abolition of slavery and previously targetedsamba,capoeiraand afro-Brazilian religions. “There’s a clear pattern of criminalising Black culture,” he added. “Since they can’t just outlaw being Black, they target something associated with the Black community.”",

    "title": "British businessman accused of plotting to smuggle US military technology to China",
    "article_text": "A British businessman has been indicted in the US with attempting to traffic sensitive American military technology toChinaand silence a critic of the Chinese president. John Miller, 63, was named by US authorities at the weekend after his arrest in Serbia, where he is facing extradition in connection with anFBIinvestigation. The Mail on Sunday reported that he was from Tunbridge Wells, Kent. Both he and a Chinese man, Cui Guanghai, are wanted in the US on charges relating to conspiracy to commit interstate stalking and conspiracy, smuggling and violations of the Arms Control Act. Both were named in US court documents, which included allegations that they had discussed ways to smuggle encryption technology out of the US and into China. The documents allege they paid a $10,000 deposit for a cryptographic device via a courier in the US. The same documents also allege that, beginning in November 2023, they had sought to buy “US defense articles, including missiles, air defense radar, drones, and cryptographic devices” for unlawful export to China. The alleged plot involved them having discussions with other people – identified in the US court documents as “Individual 5” and “Individual 6” – about smuggling the encryption technology in small electronics, a blender and a motor starter. Miller is also accused with Cui of plotting with two other individuals to prevent a US resident from protesting against Xi Jinping’s attendance at theAsia PacificEconomic Co-operation (Apec) summit in Los Angeles in November 2023. The alleged target was said to have previously made public statements in opposition to the policies and actions of the Chinese government and President Xi. In the weeks leading up to the Apec summit, Cui and Miller are alleged to have directed and coordinated a plot to surveil the victim, install a tracking device on their car, slash the tyres on their car and then purchase and destroy a pair of artistic statues created by the victim depicting President Xi and his wife. The two individuals with whom they had allegedly conspired in relation to this were in fact “acting at the direction of the FBI”. In spring last year, the alleged victim announced that he planned to make public an online video feed depicting two new artistic statues of President Xi and his wife. Miller and Cui are alleged to have paid two other individuals, who were also working with the FBI, approximately $36,500 to convince the alleged victim to desist from the online display of the statues. The US deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, said: “This is a blatant assault on both our national security and our democratic values. This justice department will not tolerate foreign repression on US soil, nor will we allow hostile nations to infiltrate or exploit our defence systems.” The FBI deputy director, Dan Bongino, said: “The defendants allegedly plotted to harass and interfere with an individual who criticised the actions of the People’s Republic of China while exercising their constitutionally protected free speech rights within the United States of America.” Miller, a permanent US resident, and Cui were named in indictments returned by federal grand juries in Milwaukee and Los Angeles. Miller was arrested in Belgrade on 24 April. If convicted they face maximum penalties of five years in prison for conspiracy, five years in prison for stalking, 20 years in prison for violation of the US Arms Export Control Act and 10 years in prison for smuggling. The US Department of Justice said it was coordinating with Serbian authorities regarding the pending extraditions of Cui and Miller from Serbia.",

    "article_text": "Anthony Albanese has responded to the United States’ calls for a huge rise in defence spending amid fears about China, while hitting back at Donald Trump’s move to double tariffs on steel and aluminium. On Saturday US secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth,urged US allies in the region, including Australia, to “share the burden” and lift defence spending to 5% of GDP, warning that “Beijing is credibly preparing to potentially use military force to alter the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific”. “There’s no reason to sugar coat it,” he said. “The threatChinaposes is real, and it could be imminent.” Albanese said Australia had already committed to additional investment in defence and would “determine our defence policy”. “We’ll determine our defence policy, we’ve invested, just across [the next four years], an additional $10bn in defence,” the prime minister said on Sunday. “What we’ll do is continue to invest in our capability but also our relationships in the region. “Our position in regards to Taiwan is very clear, has been for a long time – a bipartisan position to support the status quo.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Australia is on track to lift defence spending to 2.4% of GDP by 2033-34, up from the approximately 2% it is on now. The Pentagon undersecretary Elbridge Colby has previously told a US Senate hearing that the US wanted Australia to reach a 3% defence spending threshold. On Sunday, Australia’sdefence minister, Richard Marlessaid the issue of defence spending was a conversation he was “totally up for”, noting Hegseth had raised it in talks. The head of China’s delegation at the conference dismissed Hegseth’s warnings as “groundless accusations” and “nothing more than attempts to provoke trouble, incite division and stir up confrontation to destabilise the Asia-Pacific region”,according to Associated Press. Marles noted that China had developed the single biggest increase in military capability by any country since WWII, and that it had occurred “without strategic reassurance” and “without a clear strategic intent”. The tussle comes as Donald Trumpannounced he would double steel and aluminium import tariffsworldwide from 25% to 50% from 4 June to “further secure” his country’s domestic industry. Albanese reiterated on Sunday that the president’s decision was an “an act of economic self-harm” and “inappropriate” for US consumers. The trade minister, Don Farrell, saidAustralia would “convince” the USto exempt Australia from the universal tariffs. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion “We’re going to coolly and calmly argue our case for the removal of these tariffs,” he said. The energy minister, Chris Bowen, told ABC’s Insiders on Sunday “all options” would be considered, including a World Trade Organization dispute, but the first step would be discussions with the US. Trump had saidhe would give “great consideration”to an exemption for Australia from steel and aluminium tariffs in February but ultimately decided against any exemptions. Albanese is expected to meet Trump in person for the first time since both leaders were re-elected on the sidelines of the G7 leaders’ summit in Canada this month. The shadow finance minister, James Paterson, said the US decision was “harmful” to its relationship with Australia and that the prime minister needed to “robustly defend” Australia’s interests. “[Albanese] should lay out the case to the president both why these tariffs are unwise and unjustified, generally, but particularly why they’re unjustified when it comes to Australia, a country with which the United States has a trade surplus,” he told Sky News on Sunday. Australia exports relatively little steel to the US. About 2.5% of US aluminium imports by volume come from Australia, but this is less than 10% of Australia’s total exports of the metal. The National party leader,David Littleproud, said Albanese should convince Trump of the seriousness of the decision and to return to “rules-based order of trade”. “We have a compelling case, to have a carve-out, even if you take away the insanity of these tariffs as a whole because of our relationship andthe cheque we just dropped for submarines with the United States,” he told Weekend Today.",

    "article_text": "Queensland’s premier says there will be a full investigation into the death in custody of a Bundaberg mother accused of fatally stabbing her three-year-old daughter. Lauren Ingrid Flanigan, 32, died in hospital on Sunday after being found unresponsive in her cell at Brisbane Women’s correctional centre, Queensland police confirmed. Flanigan suffered a medical emergency in her cell on Friday night and was rushed to Princess Alexandra hospital in Brisbane. A report will be prepared for the coroner. Premier David Crisafulli said there were “questions that do need to be answered”, promising a “full and thorough investigation”. “I think it’s important that we don’t brush it under the carpet,” he said. “This incident proves that there is some explanations that are needed, and we owe it to everyone involved, people who work in the facility, families of people who have tragically lost their life, to get to the bottom of it,” he said. Crisafulli said he’s “sure” there will be a coronial inquest into the death in custody. Flanigan was being held until her next court appearance in July, after being charged with murder a week ago. Neighbours had called triple-zero after seeing a young child unresponsive in the front yard of a Moore Park Beach home, north of Bundaberg, about 4.45pm on 26 May. When emergency services arrived, they found a three-year-old girl, identified as Flanigan’s daughter Sophia Rose, with several wounds. She died at the scene. Two other children, aged one and two, were also at the property at the time, but neither was injured. Both are in the care of their father. A GoFundMe set up for Sophia Rose’s father and siblings has so far raised $55,000. Family friend Connor Thompson, who has organised the fundraiser, remembered Sophia Rose as a sweet child with an infectious laugh that could light up the room. “Her smile was like a ray of sunshine and her heart was as pure of gold,” the fundraiser said. “Though her time here was short, the love she gave and the joy she shared will stay with us forever.” In Australia, the crisis support serviceLifelineis 13 11 14.

    "title": "Student protesters face expulsion from University of Melbourne over pro-Palestine office occupation",
    "article_text": "Two University ofMelbournestudents have been recommended for expulsion and two for suspension for taking part in a pro-Palestine demonstration at the university’s Parkville campus last October. If the decisions are upheld, the students will become the first pro-Palestine student activists for whom suspension and expulsion have been enforced in Australia since thewaves of student demonstrationsagainst Israel’s assault on Gaza began in 2023. The students intend to appeal against the decision, with one telling Guardian Australia she believed the outcome had been “prejudged” by the university, which has implemented anti-protest rules thatcritics have characterised as “repressive”and an “authoritarian” overreach. The students were referred to the institution’s disciplinary committee after reports they were part of a group of about 20 who, for about 90 minutes on 9 October, occupied the office of an academic they believed was integral to the university’s partnerships with the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The protesters were calling on the university to disband its joint programs with Israeli universities, which have been a target ofthe global boycott, divestment and sanctions movementsince 2004. Footage of the occupation, distributed on social media at the time, showed protesters entering the office with their faces covered by keffiyehs, hoods and masks. The university alleged the students had harassed and intimidated staff who worked in the office, damaged property by placing signs and stickers on some university-owned items including a monitor screen, and writing on and placing stickers on personal items of the academic, including a photo. The students said their demonstration had been peaceful and clearly political, that they had informed people working in the office and nearby that they were protesting and had even offered to turn down the music they were playing so others could keep working. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email One student facing expulsion, Niamh*, who spoke to Guardian Australia on condition that her real name not be used, was found by the disciplinary committee to have been present at the demonstration for no longer than 10 minutes. Documents seen by Guardian Australia state she was not found to have performed any of the specific actions listed by the university as “harassing or intimidating” the staff, such as placing stickers or graffiti, but that her presence in the room with others was itself harassment and intimidation, and also constituted improper and unsafe use of university property. The committee said they were recommending Niamh be expelled on the basis of “the seriousness of the breaches and the nature of the behaviour” and her past alleged breaches of the student conduct code. Niamh said she believed this was a reference to her participation in the“Mahmoud’s Hall” occupation of the Arts West building, a demonstration that led to the university agreeing to additional disclosures about its research project grant arrangements. Niamh appeared to have been identified as being involved in the protest in part by the university tracking her location on campus through her wifi login, a tool that has beenthe subject of an investigationby the office of the Victorian information commissioner. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion She said she believed the activists had been “prejudged” by the university council, beginning with the then vice-chancellor, Duncan Maskell, circulatinga university-wide email the day after the protestcharacterising it as “an attempt to harass and intimidate” the academic. Maskell’s email was criticisedin an open letter signed by 174 university staff members, which said the comments risked impeding procedural fairness and “enabled the action to be incorrectly framed by major media outlets as antisemitic”. Maskell did not respond to the open letter. In May last year he implemented new university rules banning “protest that is not peaceful” and prohibiting protesters who were not university staff or students from entering university grounds. On 3 March his successor as vice-chancellor, Emma Johnston, implementedanother suite of rules against protests, including that they may not be held indoors and must not obstruct entries or exits of university buildings. The rules would apply to students and staff and also to “individual forms of action”. The student union and the National Tertiary Education Union have called the new rules “an authoritarian approach” that erroneously conflates staff and student discomfort with lack of safety. The Human Rights Law Centre, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International haveurged the universityto rescind them. Niamh said Johnston’s rules were “particularly disturbing and hypocritical” and “a massive betrayal of the values and history of student unionism” given Johnston’s own history as the university’s student union president in the 1990s, when she advocated for direct action protests including sit-ins. “Her words are irreconcilable with her actions when some of the worst anti-protest rules are being pushed through under her leadership,” Niamh said. “I would love to see the university take more of an approach of wanting to sit down with their students and wanting to really hear from where their students are coming from and why students around the world feel this urgent moral necessity to stand against … the horrible atrocities we’re witnessing in Gaza as well as the West Bank and all of occupied Palestine,” she said. A spokesperson for the University of Melbourne said it would not comment on individual cases “to protect the integrity of our disciplinary processes’”. “The University of Melbourne has followed its disciplinary processes in accordance with University policy in response to an incident that took place in October 2024,” the spokesperson said. “This process has not concluded. The University is communicating directly with individuals involved in disciplinary proceedings. Students have the right to appeal decisions made through the University’s disciplinary processes.” Last year an Australian National University studentwho was expelledand a Deakin University studentwho was suspendedfor Palestine-related activism had those decisions overturned on appeal. *Name has been changed",

    "title": "Natural disasters cost Australia’s economy $2.2bn in first half of 2025, new Treasury analysis shows",
    "article_text": "Six months of natural disasters in 2025 have cost the economy $2.2bn, largely in slower retail and household spending, according to new federal Treasury analysis. Wild weather has repeatedly battered the Australian east coast this year. The analysis period covers Cyclone Alfred, the first cyclone to hit south-east Queensland in 50 years,and associated flooding. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email It also includes the impact of last month’s severe flooding in New South Wales’s Hunter and mid-north coast regions. The disaster left about 10,000 buildings with flood damage, withan estimated 1,000uninhabitable, and claimed five lives. Outbackandnorth Queenslandalso flooded this year. Australia’s land surface haswarmed by 1.5C since 1910and the climate crisis has increased the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, including flooding. Treasury expects most of the immediate loss in economic activity to take place in the March quarter. Partial data for the March quarter has shown that retail trade and household spending have been the most significantly impacted as a result of the disasters. Nominal retail trade inQueenslandfell 0.3% in February and 0.4% in March, according to Treasury analysis. Household spending was flat, with a 0.2% drop in Queensland. Full March quarter national accounts will be released on Wednesday. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion “The human impacts matter to us most, but the economic cost is very significant too, and we’ll see that in Wednesday’s national accounts,” said the treasurer,Jim Chalmers. “The government will be there for people in disaster-hit regions, just like they’re there for each other. “We’ve activated disaster assistance to the Hunter and mid-north coast regions of NSW, just as we did earlier in the year in Queensland and northern NSW.” The treasurer said the economic progress Australians had made lowering inflation, debt and unemployment meant “we’re in a stronger position to provide support when communities need it most”. The federal government hasannounced several rounds of disaster payments. The minister for emergency management, Kristy McBain, said it planned to fund projects designed to improve preparedness and resilience in order to protect communities when disasters strike. “We are committed to funding support to increase resilience, adaptability and preparedness,” she said. “Our disaster ready fund initiative will provide another $200m of investment in 2025-26.” McBain said she had been on the ground in NSW, where she saw “first-hand the effects a disaster can have”, and had been meeting with small businesses and primary producers that had been “hit hard”. “It is my priority to work closely with all levels of government to ensure support is provided as quickly as possible,” she said. McBain said the federal government would “continue to work with NSW on any other funding requests”. “For a lot of these people, it’s the cumulative impact of a number of events, and we understand that,” she said. “That’s why recovery isn’t going to be over the next couple of days when cameras and lights are on the area. It’s going to be days, weeks and months that we’ll walk with these communities.”",

    "title": "Man dies in shooting at shopping centre in Co Carlow, Ireland",
    "article_text": "A man has died after a shooting at a shopping centre in County Carlow. The PA news agency understands that it appears that the dead man’s wounds were self-inflicted. A young girl was also injured in the incident but did not require hospital care and it is unclear how she was injured. Gardai have identified the dead man as a white Irish male. Ireland’s justice minister, Jim O’Callaghan, has described it as a “really shocking incident”. One local councillor told how people ran terrified from the shopping centre in Carlow town as shots were fired. The body of the man remains at the scene and will not be removed until the area has been declared safe. The shopping centre was evacuated and emergency services remain at the scene, but gardai said there is no further concern for public safety. A Garda spokesperson said they were alerted to reports of a firearm discharge at Fairgreen shopping centre shortly after 6.15pm. The spokesperson said: “An Garda Síochaná are currently at the scene, with the shopping centre and car park cordoned off. The cordon will remain in place overnight. A white Irish adult male is deceased at the scene. “The army explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) team has been requested to attend.” Ireland’s deputy leader, Simon Harris, said he was “deeply concerned”, adding: “I understand a young child has been hurt and I join with people across our country in thinking of them and their family tonight. “I am also thinking of all those who witnessed this situation and the awful shock and upset it must have caused them. I know their families and communities will rally to support them. I am grateful to our emergency services for their work and response.” O’Callaghan said: “This was a really shocking incident. My thoughts are with everyone affected by the shooting and the community and families impacted, including those working at the scene. “This is something we never want or expect to happen in our communities. Gun violence is very rare in Ireland, and I am determined that will remain the case. The area in Carlow is safe. “We must now allow An Garda Síochána to investigate this incident fully.” A local Fine Gael councillor, Fergal Browne, said: “People were obviously terrified, a bank holiday Sunday, going into town to do their shopping. People ran from the centre crying and upset. “There was a bunch of foreign students in the area, who could not believe they were caught up in the middle of all of it. “It’s a busy spot. We launched a photographic exhibition there on Friday night in the shopping centre.” Browne added: “There is lots of activity in the centre between people shopping and people working there, exhibitions. It’s very upsetting for everyone who was involved in it or who witnessed it. I was down there in the last hour and it seems to have calmed down a good bit now.” Browne said he wanted to thank all the emergency services that had attended the scene.",

    "article_text": "Two Scottish men have been shot dead outside a bar in southernSpain. The victims were gunned down outside Monaghans, a popular Irish-themed bar in the coastal town of Fuengirola, Málaga, at about 11pm on Saturday. A masked man opened fire on the pair as they stood outside the venue before fleeing on foot. Both men died at the scene. Javier Salas, the deputy government delegate in Málaga, said both victims were believed to be Scottish nationals. Specialist officers from the Guardia Civil’s violent crime unit are reportedly leading the investigation. Monaghans Irish bar, which sits on the seafront, is a well-known pub popular with British tourists and expats. Witnesses said it was busy on Saturday night with football fans watching the Champions League final. A resident told local paper Málaga Hoy: “I thought they were going to kill me too. I thought I was hearing fireworks at first but then saw the noise was coming from someone firing a gun.” A Chinese expat who owns a shop next to the bar said: “I heard a noise coming from next door. I looked out and saw a man pointing at something and shooting.” A worker at a nearby beach bar and restaurant also recounted how families with children took refuge inside after the shooting started. “I didn’t see anything because we focused on crouching down and staying safe, but it was a very frightening experience. Obviously all the customers we had left as soon as it was safe to do so.” A spokesperson for the Foreign Office said it had not been approached for consular assistance but that its staff stood ready to support any British nationals in need. PoliceScotlandhave been contacted for comment.",

    "title": "Palestinians gunned down while trying to reach food aid site in Gaza, hospital says",
    "article_text": "More than 30 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire on Sunday as they went to receive food at an aid distribution point set up by an Israeli-backed foundation in Gaza, according to witnesses, and a hospital run by the Red Cross confirming it was treating many wounded. Witnesses said Israeli forces had opened fire as Palestinians headed toward the aid distribution site in Rafah run by theGazaHumanitarian Foundation (GHF). “My brother went to receive aid from the American distribution points in Rafah when the bullets started raining down on them,” Yarin Abu al-Naja, 44, said. “The Israeli soldiers had started shooting at the people there. My brother went with two of his friends. One of them was critically injured in the head, the other was killed, and my brother was shot in the back.” “He was transported to the hospital by a donkey cart – no ambulances can reach the area, and there were dozens of injured and dead,” Naja added. “We saw him placed on the ground. There were no available beds due to the large number of casualties and dead arriving from the same location. The scenes were horrific – people missing limbs, hands or legs, others decapitated, or with open abdomens.” Media reports said dozens of people were being treated at the hospital after the latest incident at thecontroversial site in Rafah. Officials at the field hospital did not say who opened fire but added that another 175 people were wounded. The International Committee of the Red Cross said (ICRC) its field hospital in Rafah received a “mass casualty influx” of 179 people, 21 of whom were declared dead upon arrival. “All patients said they had been trying to reach an aid distribution site,” the ICRC added, describing it as “the highest number of weapon-wounded in a single incident since the establishment of the field hospital over a year ago”. Local health authorities said at least 31 of the dead were taken to Nasser hospital. The Red Crescent also reported a further 14 Palestinians were injured near a separate aid distribution site in central Gaza. The Israeli forces denied “firing at civilians”. However, an Israel Defense Forces official admitted that Israeli soldiers fired “warning shots toward several suspects who advanced toward the troops on Saturday”, near the aid distribution site, without specifying who the suspects were. The Israeli-backed aid foundation claimed that it delivered aid “without incident” early on Sunday and has denied previous accounts of gunfire around its sites, which are in Israeli military zones where independent access is limited. Israeli forces had given orders that no one should approach the hub before 6am local time. Multiple witnesses said people had begun lining up from 5am, and dozens were said to have surged forward and started running towards it. When the crowds reached the Flag Roundabout, about 0.6 miles (1km) away, Israeli forces started shooting at the crowd, witnesses said. “I went with my brother Shuhada to get food for our children,” Hani Baraka, 43, said. ‘‘The area was very crowded. At the start, a quadcopter drone came and gave orders, saying it was still too early to open the gates and that they would open them at 6am. It seems people moved forward earlier than the time set by the army. The soldiers panicked and began firing at the crowd. My brother was shot in the head and killed instantly.” “On its way back, the drone hit a hanging wire and fell to the ground,” Baraka added. “People rushed toward it, and then the Israeli soldiers opened fire on us. Army snipers surrounded the area and started shooting at the crowd.” The GHF has hired private security firms, but according to witnesses, the private contractors did not open fire on the crowd. “Inside the gate, there were armed American soldiers, but they did not fire at us,” Baraka said. “They only threw plastic stun grenades in the square to scare people and clear the area once the aid ran out.” Reuters footage showed ambulance vehicles carrying injured people to Nasser hospital. Other clips emerged showing people running and ducking, with apparent gunfire audible in the background. One piece of footage seems to have been filmed in the Salah al-Din Road, just south of an aid distribution site in the Netzarim corridor. Doctors at Nasser hospital reported chaotic scenes, with dozens of bodies being brought in. “The situation in the hospital is catastrophic, due to the massacre of the hungry in Rafah city, near the aid distribution centre,” said Dr Marwan al-Hams, 53, a medic in the emergency department at Nasser hospital. “Most injuries were shot in the upper parts of the body – the head, chest, and abdomen – as the Israeli army was reportedly firing from high altitudes using aircraft or quadcopters. A witness on the scene said that shots were also fired from a crane and from tanks.” The hub is part of a controversial new aid system. On 28 May,Hamas accused Israel of killing at least three Palestiniansand wounding 46 near one of the GHF’s distribution sites, an accusation the group denied. The Israeli military said its troops fired warning shots in the area outside the compound to re-establish control as thousands of Palestinians rushed to an aid distribution site. Israelimposed a blockade on all suppliesin March, saying Hamas was seizing deliveries for its fighters, which the group denies. Earlier this month, a global hunger monitor said half a million people in the strip faced starvation. TheIPC estimatedthat nearly 71,000 children under the age of five were expected to be “acutely malnourished”, with 14,100 cases expected to be severe in the next 11 months. The UN and other humanitarian organisations have rejected the new system for food distribution, saying it would not be able to meet the needs of Gaza’s 2.3 million people and allowed Israel to use food as a weapon to control the population. The latest incident took place as Hamas and Israel exchanged blame over a faltering effort to secure a ceasefire. Hamas said on Saturdayit was seeking amendments to a US-backed ceasefire proposal, but Donald Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff rejected the group’s response as “totally unacceptable”.

    "article_text": "Israeli forces opened fire on people heading towards aid distribution site run by Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, say witnesses We have an update on reports that Israeli forces opened fire near a US-backed aid distribution site inRafah, killing more than 20 Palestinian people (seeopening postfor more details on this). Gaza’s civil defence agency said in an update that Israeli fire killed at least 22 people on Sunday, revising an earlier death toll. “The number of martyrs from the massacre at the American aid centre in Rafah has risen to at least 22, with more than 120 wounded, including children,” civil defence spokesperson Mahmud Bassal told the Agence France-Presse (AFP) news agency. Gaza’s civil defence crews are the main emergency service, alongside ambulance crews, in the Strip and regularly help pull the living and the dead from underneath rubble after Israeli bombardments. An Israeli attack near an aid distribution point in southern Gaza killed as many as 31 Palestinian people on Sunday, according to local health authorities, eyewitnesses and media reports. Witnesses told the Associated Press that Israeli forces had opened fire as they headed toward the aid distribution site inRafahrun by theGaza Humanitarian Foundation(GHF). The US and Israel-backed GHF, which aims to bypass the UN as the main supplier of aid to the civilian population of Gaza, said the reports were fabricated. The Red Crescent reported that 14 Palestinian people were injured on Sunday by Israeli fire near a separate site in central Gaza. At least 54,418 Palestinian people have been killed and 124,190 injured in Israeli attacks on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in an update. Israeli defence minister,Israel Katz, said he has instructed the military to continue advancing towards “all targets” in Gaza despite ongoing ceasefire negotiations being mediated by the US, Israel’s biggest ally. Hamas announced on Saturday that it had replied to a US-backed Gaza ceasefire proposal, but Washington’s main negotiator criticised the response as “totally unacceptable”. It means that a significant breakthrough is unlikely to come anytime soon. Thanks for joining us. We are closing this blog now. You can find all ourlatest coverage of the Middle East here. Israeli defence minister,Israel Katz, said he has instructed the military to continue advancing towards “all targets” in Gaza despite ongoing ceasefire negotiations being mediated by the US, Israel’s biggest ally. In a post on X, he wrote: On the eve of Shavuot (the Jewish holiday celebrating the harvest season in Israel), the IDF is operating in Gaza with great intensity, crushing the enemy and paving the way for the maneuvering forces. I have instructed the IDF to continue forward against all targets, regardless of any negotiations, and to employ every necessary means from the air, land, and sea to protect IDF soldiers and to eliminate and destroy Hamas murderers. Those who massacred and fought against us will pay the full price. As I said: either Hamas releases the hostages, or it will be destroyed. At least 54,418 Palestinian people have been killed and 124,190 injured in Israeli attacks on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Sunday. More than 30 people were killed and at least 136 others injured in the last 24 hours alone, the ministry said. In a post on Telegram, it added: There are still a number of victims under the rubble and on the streets, and the ambulance and civil defense crews are unable to reach them. Here are some key points outlined in the UN’s latest humanitarian update on Gaza, which you can read in fullhere. It was published on May 28 2025. Over 632,000 people have been displaced again since 18 March (whenIsraelbroke the ceasefire with Hamas), as more than 30 Israeli displacement orders have pushed Palestinian people into an ever-shrinking space. Since mid March, Israeli forces have escalated its deadly bombardments from the air, land and sea across the Strip, resulting in the destruction of civilian infrastructure, the large-scale displacement of people and many casualties. The health system in Gaza is overwhelmed by a further decline in the number of functional and accessible health service points and a critically insufficient bed capacity. At least 28 aid workers have been killed in Gaza since 1 May 2025, an average of one aid worker killed per day. Since 7 October 2023, at least 452 aid workers, including 315 UN staff, have been killed. Dr Marwan al-Hams, a health ministry official at the Nasser hospital, where many of the injured are being treated, said that most of the casualties were shot “in the upper part of their bodies, including the head, neck and chest”. He said 24 people were being treated in the hospital’s intensive care unit. TheGazaHumanitarian Foundation has denied there were injuries or fatalities at its distribution site. The Associated Press has some eyewitness quotes from people who were near the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation’s distribution centre in Rafah earlier today when Israeli gunfire reportedly killed at least 31 people. “There was fire from all directions, from naval warships, from tanks and drones,” said Amr Abu Teiba, who was in the crowd. He said he saw at least 10 bodies with gunshot wounds and several other injured people, including women. People used carts to ferry the dead and injured to the field hospital. “The scene was horrible,” he said. Ibrahim Abu Saoud, another eyewitness, said the Israeli military fired from about 300 meters (yards) away. He said said he saw many people with gunshot wounds, including a young man who he said had died at the scene. Mohammed Abu Teaima, 33, said he saw Israeli forces open fire and kill his cousin and another woman as they were heading toward the distribution site. He said his cousin was shot in his chest and died at the scene. Many others were wounded, including his brother-in-law, he said. “They opened heavy fire directly toward us,” he said. Here are some of the latest images being sent to us over the newswires from Gaza: The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a newly created private logistics group backed by the US and endorsed byIsrael, has given a response to reports that dozens of Palestinian people were killed when Israeli tanks opened fire near one of its aid distribution sites in Gaza earlier today. “It is false and fabricated. All aid was distributed today without incident,” the GHF said, telling BBC News that there have been no injuries or fatalities. “We have heard that these fake reports have been actively fomented by Hamas. They are untrue and fabricated.” We have not been able to verify this information yet. Lebanon’s health ministry said an Israeli airstrike on the south of the country killed one person earlier today. It said an Israeli airstrike targeted a motorcycle in the village ofArnoun, in theNabatiehregion about five kilometres (three miles) from the Israeli border. The November ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, brokered by France and the US, brought an official end to Israel’s assault on Lebanon last year but it remains extremely precarious. Under the agreement, Israeli forces were supposed to withdraw from all Lebanese territory by late January while Hezbollah had to end its armed presence south of the Litani river along the border with Israel. But each side accuses the other of not living up to those terms. Israeldelayed a promised troop withdrawal in Januaryand continued to occupy several so-called “strategic” hilltops in southern Lebanon. The Israeli military has also carried out frequent attacks on the country, claiming it is targeting Hezbollah fighters and weapons, but many civilians have been killed in the airstrikes. The Reuters news agency is saying, in an updated death toll, that the reported Israeli attack near an aid distribution in Rafah killed at least 31 Palestinian people in Gaza on Sunday. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said it’s “currently unaware of injuries caused by IDF fire” at the humanitarian aid distribution site in Rafah, whereat least 22 Palestinian people were killed this morning. “The matter is still under review,” it adds in a statement. Rescuers, medics and eyewitnesses said Israeli forces fired on crowds near the aid site. Zaher al-Waheidi, head of theGazahealth ministry’s records department, said at least 25 people were killed, including two women. At least eight Palestinian people were killed and several others injured earlier today after an Israeli airstrike hit a vehicle in thejurat al-lout area, east of southern Gaza’sKhan Younis,Palestinian news agency Wafa is reporting. We have an update on reports that Israeli forces opened fire near a US-backed aid distribution site inRafah, killing more than 20 Palestinian people (seeopening postfor more details on this). Gaza’s civil defence agency said in an update that Israeli fire killed at least 22 people on Sunday, revising an earlier death toll. “The number of martyrs from the massacre at the American aid centre in Rafah has risen to at least 22, with more than 120 wounded, including children,” civil defence spokesperson Mahmud Bassal told the Agence France-Presse (AFP) news agency. Gaza’s civil defence crews are the main emergency service, alongside ambulance crews, in the Strip and regularly help pull the living and the dead from underneath rubble after Israeli bombardments. In other developments, Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, said on Saturday it had submitted its response containing some amendments to a proposal presented by Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy,Steve Witkoff, to mediators. Hamas said that under the deal, it will release 10 living hostages and 18 bodies in return for Israel’s release of Palestinian prisoners – a change to the US’s latest proposal that will make it more difficult forIsraelto resume its assault on Gaza if talks on a permanent ceasefire are not completed by the end of the truce. The updated proposal includes a demand for an end to the war, which had previously been a red line for Israel, and envisions the release of the Israelis held captive inGazabeing spread out more throughout the 60-day truce, rather than in two batches on the first and seventh day as the US offer suggested. Witkoff responded on Saturday evening by saying the Hamas response was “totally unacceptable and only takes us backward”. A senior Hamas official responded that the group “did not reject” the hostage release proposal, and that Witkoff’s response to their answer was “unfair” and showed “complete bias” in favour ofIsrael. Israel imposed its aid blockade in early March, cutting off all supplies including food, medicine, shelter and fuel in what has been condemned as the collective punishment of the civilian population in Gaza. The aid was only partially lifted because of strong international pressure. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said before the easing of restrictions that Israel must not letGazasink into famine for “practical and diplomatic reasons”, with US senators and key allies telling him they could not handle images of mass hunger. TheIPC estimatedthat nearly 71,000 children under the age of five were expected to be “acutely malnourished”, with 14,100 cases expected to be severe in the next 11 months. As we mentioned in the opening post, theGaza Humanitarian Foundation(GHF) has taken over the handling of aid in the territory. The GHF is using private American security and logistics companies to transport aid intoGazafor distribution by civilian teams at what are meant to be secure distribution sites. It aims to bypass the UN as the main supplier of aid to the 2.1 million people in Gaza, where the population has been brought to the brink of famine by an 11-week Israeli aid blockade that was only eased just over a week ago. The amount of aid being allowed into the Strip is still totally inadequate for the population’s needs. The UN and aid groupshave pushed back against the new system led by GHF, accusing Israel of trying to use food as a weapon. The new system has been described as unworkable, dangerous and potentially unlawful by aid agencies because it could lead to the forced mass transfer of populations. The GHF says it distributed two million meals this week, a figure we have not yet been able to independently verify. Israel set up the plan after accusing Hamas of stealing aid, something the Palestinian militant group denies. The GHF launch was marred bytumultuous scenes on Tuesdaywhen Israeli troops opened fire on a large crowd, killing at least one civilian and injuring dozens of other Palestinian people. We are continuing our live coverage of the latest developments in the Middle East, with a particular focus on Israel’s war on Gaza. More than 20 people were killed on Sunday as they went to receive food at an aid distribution point set up by an Israeli-backed foundation in theGazaStrip, according to a hospital run by the Red Cross that received the bodies. Witnesses told the Associated Press that Israeli forces opened fire on people as they headed toward the aid distribution site run by theGaza Humanitarian Foundation(GHF). “There were many martyrs, including women,” the 40-year-old resident said. “We were about 300 metres away from the military.” Media reports said dozens of people were being treated at the hospital after the latest incident at thecontroversial site in Rafah. Officials at the field hospital did not say who opened fire but added that another 175 people were wounded. An Associated Press reporter saw dozens of people being treated at the hospital.",

    "title": "Gaza doctor who lost nine children in Israeli airstrike dies from wounds in same attack",
    "article_text": "A Palestinian father who had lost nine of his 10 children in an Israeli airstrike has died from wounds sustained in the same attack, local health officials have said. Hamdi al-Najjar, 40, a doctor at Nasser hospital, was critically injured when Israeli forces bombed the family house in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis on 23 May,killing nine of his children. He had just returned home after accompanying his wife Alaa, a paediatrician at the Nasser medical complex, to work when the building was struck. He had initially survived alongside his son Adam, 11, who is still in hospital. Even by the terrible standards of theGazaconflict, their deaths had shocked the international community. Footage shared by the director of Gaza’s health ministry and verified by the Guardian showed the burnt, dismembered bodies of Najjar’s children being pulled from the rubble of their house near a petrol station as flames engulfed what remained of the family’s home. Alaa had received the bodies while she was still at work. Sources at the Nasser hospital who transferred the children’s bodies one by one to the morgue said their mother was not able to identify them, so bad were the burns. Doctors told the Guardian her husband was suffering from severe injuries – brain damage and fractures caused by shrapnel, along with shrapnel wounds and fractures in the chest. He was placed on a ventilator and fitted with medical tubes. On Sunday, they said, he passed away from the severe wounds sustained in the attack. Following an appeal issued by Adam’s uncle, Ali al-Najjar, 50, and reported by the Italian newspaper La Repubblica, Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani,said the country was ready to receive Adamfor medical care and was working to arrange his evacuation on 11 June. Italy had expressed a willingness to evacuate both the father and mother as well, but due to Najjar’s critical condition, transferring him out of Gaza was deemed too dangerous. His wife had agreed for their son, Adam, to be taken to Italy with an aunt and three cousins, but said she would remain by her husband’s side. After Najjar’s death, sources within the Italian foreign ministry have indicated that his wife may also be evacuated to Italy.",

    "title": "Spending on agency staff across NHS England drops by almost £1bn",
    "article_text": "Spending on agency staff across NHS England dropped by almost £1bn in the last financial year, ministers have said, after a pledge byWes Streetingto cut the amount going to agencies by 30%. According to the Department ofHealthand Social Care, the total spent by trusts on agency staff during 2024-25 was nearly £1bn lower than the previous year. In a speech to theNHSProviders conference in November, Streeting, the health secretary, said a lack of permanent staff had seen gaps filled by more expensive agency-provided replacements totalling about £3bn a year. Under proposals outlined at the time, but not yet enacted, Streeting suggested that NHS trusts could be completely banned from using agency staff for lower level jobs such as healthcare assistants and domestic support workers. This could also involve stopping NHS staff from resigning and then immediately signing on with an agency, so they can do the same work for higher wages, and a much higher overall cost to the NHS. In addition to employing agency staff, which can mean paying a doctor thousand of pounds for a single shift, NHS trusts also routinely plug gaps by using what are known as “bank” staff – NHS employees who do extra shifts at their own workplace or one nearby, via an organisation usually run by the trust. UK-wide figuresreported by the Guardianin January 2024 showed that the combined spend of hospitals and GP surgeries for agency staff was an annual £4.6bn, with another £5.8bn used for bank shifts. As part of the clampdown on agency spending, Streeting and James Mackey, the chief executive of theimminently abolishedNHS England, have jointly written to all NHS providers and integrated care board executives to set out that each should target the 30% reduction, and that their progress will be monitored. “If we do not feel that sufficient progress is being made by the autumn, we will consider what further legislative steps we should take to ensure that use of agency staff is brought to an end,” they wrote. The letter also says hospital bosses should make surethe pay rates for bank shifts “are competitive but do not exceed those paid by agencies directly to the worker”. Trusts have already been ordered to reduce bank use by at least 10%.

    "title": "Relatives of 1994 Chinook crash victims initiate legal action against MoD",
    "article_text": "Relatives of intelligence officers and military personnel killed in a 1994 RAF helicopter crash on the Mull of Kintyre have taken the first step in legal action against theMinistry of Defence(MoD). Twenty-nine people – including officers from MI5, the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the army, along with the helicopter’s special forces crew – died after RAF Chinook ZD576 crashed in foggy weather in south-westScotlandon 2 June 1994. Now, 31 years to the day, lawyers acting pro bono for the bereaved have issued the MoD with a “letter before action”, seen by the Guardian. The letter formally informs the MoD of the Chinook Justice Campaign’s intention to apply for a judicial review of the decision not to hold a public inquiry into circumstances of the crash, citing article 2 of the Human Rights Act, which protects the right to life. It urges the secretary of state for defence, John Healey, to start an inquiry “without further delay”, giving him 14 days to respond. Last week the Guardian reported the families’ demand, in an open letter to the government, for thefull release of archive documentsthat have been locked away until 2094 by the MoD. Their lawyers believe a public judge-led inquiry would have full access to material that previous investigations have not been able to consider. Sign up toHeadlines UK Get the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion Mark Stephens, of the law firm Howard Kennedy, said: “The government has a legal obligation to answer the families. Thirty-one years on, there can be no operational reasons for secrecy and the only way to find out the truth is with a judge-led inquiry where the judge can review the so-called ‘secret’ material and answer the multitude of questions that are left begging.” Stephens said the families and their legal counsel had seen “more than enough evidence” to convince them the “aircraft should never have taken off”. The most recent review, by Lord Philip in 2011, set out safety concerns but concluded the cause of the crash was unlikely to be ever known, whileexonerating the helicopter’s late pilots, Flt Lts Richard Cook and Jonathan Tapper, who had been found guilty of “gross negligence” by the RAF 17 years earlier. Esme Sparks, from County Durham, whose father, Maj Gary Sparks, was killed in the crash, said: “We don’t want to have to take legal action against the government, but we do want and need answers. What is being hidden? In our view, a public inquiry is key.” Andy Tobias, who was eight when his father, Lt Col John Tobias, 41, was killed, said: “It’s clear to me that a complete lack of duty of care was given to those passengers because they got on a Chinook that wasn’t fit for flight. “And really, the government need to show their duty of candour and really be open and transparent about what’s in those documents and give us the opportunity to really understand anything that’s in them that could give us more answers about what happened.” On Sunday, families attended a private commemoration at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire. Describing the crash as “a tragic accident”, an MoD spokesperson previously said: “Our thoughts and sympathies remain with the families, friends and colleagues of all those who died.”",

    "title": "Defence review to say UK must be ready to fight a war in Europe or Atlantic",
    "article_text": "Britain needs to be ready to fight a war in Europe or the Atlantic, a strategic defence review will conclude, though it is not expected to promise immediate increases in the size of the armed forces to deal with the threat. The 130-page document will call for a move to “war-fighting readiness” to deter Russian aggression in Europe and increases in stockpiles of arms and support equipment, some of which may only last days in a crisis. Keir Starmer, the prime minister, will launch the review on Monday, saying the exercise “will ensure the UK rises to the challenge and our armed forces have the equipment they need” in what ministers say is an increasingly unstable world. But it is not expected to contain any additional spending commitments and the defence secretary,John Healey, acknowledged on Sunday that any plans to increase the size of the British army, at its smallest for 300 years, will have to wait until after the election. Speaking to the BBC, Healey said there had been “15 years of a recruitment and retention crisis in our armed forces” as he acknowledged that the size of the army had fallen to a low 70,860 – below the government’s current target of 73,000. The minister conceded thatLabourhad so far failed to turn the situation around, despite talk that Britain is prepared to participate in a peacekeeping deployment in Ukraine. “We’ve still got more people leaving than joining,” he said. “The first job is to reverse that trend, and then I want to see in the next parliament our ability to start to increase the number [of soldiers],” Healey continued, apparently deferring any increase until after an election due in 2029. There had been speculation that Healey had been seeking to secure a commitment to increase the target size of the army to 76,000, though defence sources said that could have cost up to £2.5bn in pay, accommodation and equipment. Though Russia is heavily embroiled in the war in Ukraine, experts believe that if the Kremlin agreed to a ceasefire, it could allow time for a country with an army of more than 600,000 and a militarised economy to threaten other parts of Nato’s eastern flank. The three-strong review team, led by Lord Robertson, a former Nato secretary general, has made 62 recommendations, in response to whatthe team has concluded is “a new era of threat”from aggressive states such as Russia and drones, artificial intelligence and other new technologies. On Sunday, Ukraine said that it had attacked 40 Russian bombers at airfields deep inside Russia, using remotely piloted one-way attack drones that were hidden in trucks inside Russia until ready to use. Operation Spider’s Web was in preparation for 18 months, with relatively cheap drones targeting strategic Russian aviation. It is also expected to conclude: The UK will commit to building 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines at Barrow in Cumbria and Raynesway, Derby, as part of the three-country Aukus programme with the US and Australia. The first submarines will launch in the late 2030s, replacing seven Astute-class submarines, tasked to operate around the world. A total of £15bn will be invested in modernising the production of nuclear weapons at Aldermaston in Berkshire, supporting more than 9,000 jobs as part of a programme to supply bombs for the Dreadnought submarines that will replace the ageing Vanguard boats that carry the Trident deterrent. That Russia poses an “immediate and pressing” danger posed by Russia while China is a “sophisticated and persistent challenge” to British interests. Iran and North Korea will be described as “regional disruptors” and potentially hostile to the UK, with each of the four showing growing signs of being willing to work together. A new volunteer-led Home Guard be created to help protect airports, communications nodes and other parts of Britain’s critical national infrastructure from drone and other surprise attacks, freeing up the time of soldiers and specialist police who guard such locations at present. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Ministers are also considering whether to restore an air-launched nuclear deterrent by buying F-35A aircraft which have been certified to carry the US B61-12 gravity bomb, which has a maximum explosive yield of 50 kilotons, more than three times the size of the 15kT bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. A report in theSunday Timessaid the UK was considering buying the F-35A, though any arrangement to deploy B61 nuclear bombs in addition would probably be similar to existing situations in the Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy and Turkey, where nuclear weapons belonging to the US are stored in bunkers in those countries. Britain is the only big nuclear power that has only one method of delivering a nuclear weapon, from a submarine at sea. But engaging in “nuclear sharing” with the US would be complex, and would require sensitive negotiations with the Trump administration if it were the path chosen. In Europe, B61 bombs remain US property until there is a deemed to be war. At that point, because non-proliferation rules are then deemed not to apply, “the host country puts the weapons on their planes and sets off with them,” according to Dave Cullen, a nuclear expert at the Basic thinktank. Healey declined to comment on air-launched nuclear weapons on Sunday, and no announcement is expected on the issue shortly. The minister instead reiterated the value of Trident. “For over 70 years, our UK nuclear deterrent has been the ultimate guarantee of security in this country. It’s what Putin fears most,” he told the BBC. The defence review is not expected to announce any immediate increase in defence budgets, beyond a commitment to lift spending by about £5bn to 2.5% of GDP in 2027 and to 3% in the next parliament. But Starmer and other Nato leaders are expected to discuss and agree fresh spending targets at a summit in The Hague later this month, of about 5% of GDP, of which 3.5% will be on military spending and the rest on cyberdefence and other infrastructure.",

    "title": "Boulder attack: six injured in Colorado after man allegedly targets rally for Israeli hostages",
    "article_text": "Six people were injured in an attack in Boulder,Coloradoafter a man is alleged to have thrown an incendiary device into a crowd and yelled “Free Palestine”, in what the FBI is treating as an “act of terrorism”. The 45-year-old man, identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, is alleged to have thrown the device into a group of people who had assembled in a pedestrianised zone for a peaceful protest for Israeli hostages still held in Gaza. “It is clear that this is a targeted act of violence and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism,” Mark Michalek, an FBI special agent, told a press conference, citing witnesses. Boulder police chief Stephen Redfearn had earlier refused to call the incident an act of terrorism, saying it was too early to speculate on the alleged attacker’s motivations. He said the department received calls at about 1.26pm local time of a man with a weapon near a downtown courthouse and that people were being set on fire. When police responded, they found people with injuries consistent with burns. A suspect was pointed out to officers and a man was taken into custody and then to the hospital with minor injuries. Redfearn said the police were investigating “a vehicle of interest” on the scene, and several blocks had been closed off. Police and bomb squads are still “clearing the area for devices”, he said. Michalek said there was no evidence that the man was connected to a wider group. The six people injured were between the ages of 67 and 88, police said, and their injuries ranged from minor to “very serious”. Four were taken to a local hospital, while two had to be airlifted to a hospital in Aurora. Brooke Coffman, a university student at the scene of the attack, said she saw four women on the ground with burns on their legs, Reuters reported. One of them appeared to have been badly burned on most of her body and had been wrapped in a flag by someone, she said. The attack comes amid heightened tensions in the United States over Israel’s war in Gaza, which has spurred both an increase in antisemitic hate crimes as well as efforts by conservative supporters of Israel to brand pro-Palestinian protests as antisemitic. Donald Trump’s administration has detained protesters of the war without charge and cut off funding to elite US universities that have permitted such demonstrations. Colorado governor Jared Polissaidthat he is “closely monitoring” the situation, adding: “My thoughts go out to the people who have been injured and impacted by this heinous act of terror. Hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable.” The Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, a prominent Jewish Democrat, described the attack as “horrifying”. “We must stand up to antisemitism,” he said. The attack follows the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington DC who had attended an event hosted by the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group that fights antisemitism and supports Israel. The crowd targeted in Boulder had gathered for an event called Run for Their Lives, a walk to show support for the Israeli hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza, according to a statement by the Boulder Jewish Community Centre. The group meets every Sunday to call for the hostages’ release. “Our hearts go out to those who witnessed this horrible attack, and prayers for a speedy recovery to those who were injured,” the statement reads.“When events like this enter our own community, we are shaken. Our hope is that we come together for one another.” With Reuters",

    "title": "Exclusive: US veterans agency orders scientists not to publish in journals without clearance",
    "article_text": "Senior officials at the US Department of Veterans Affairs have ordered that VA physicians and scientists not publish in medical journals or speak with the public without first seeking clearance from political appointees ofDonald Trump, the Guardian has learned. The edict, laid down in emails on Friday byCurt Cashour, the VA’s assistant secretary for public and intergovernmental affairs, andJohn Bartrum, a senior adviser to VA secretary Doug Collins, came hours after the prestigious New England Journal of Medicinepublished a perspectiveco-authored by two pulmonologists who work for the VA in Texas. “We have guidance for this,” wrote Cashour, a former Republican congressional aide and campaign consultant, attaching the journal article. “These people did not follow it.” The article warned that cancelled contracts, layoffs and a plannedstaff reduction of 80,000 employeesin the nation’s largest integrated healthcare system jeopardizes the health of a million veterans seeking help for conditions linked to toxic exposure – ranging from Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange to veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan who developed cancer after being exposed to smoke from piles of flaming toxic waste. “As pulmonologists in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), we have been seeing increasing numbers of veterans with chronic bronchitis, pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, and other respiratory conditions,” doctors Pavan Ganapathiraju and Rebecca Traylor wrote. The authors, who practice at the VA in Austin, Texas, noted that in 2022 Congress dramatically expanded the number of medical conditions presumed to be linked to military service. “But legislation doesn’t care for patients, people do,” they wrote. The article sparked an immediate rebuke from Trump’s political appointees, according to internal emails obtained by the Guardian. “We have noticed a number of academic articles and press articles recently,” Bartrum wrote, attaching a copy of the journal article. “Please remind the field and academic community that they need to follow the VA policy.” Cashour, the assistant secretary, wrote that approval for publication in national media was delegated to his office. Local and regional directors were to inform Washington “as soon as possible” when situations exist “that have the potential for negative national exposure”. In an email statement, the VA press secretary Peter Kasperowicz said the agency’s policy on publications and public comments “simply requires VA employees to properly coordinate with public affairs staff prior to speaking with the media. Virtually every organization both inside and outside government has similar policies.” The policy “has been in place for several years across both Democrat and Republican administrations”, he said. Ganapathiraju told the Guardian that the article was in full compliance with the VA regulations, which state that employees are encouraged to publish in “peer-reviewed, professional or scholarly journals”. Coordination with public affairs officers is encouraged, but not required, when sharing personal or academic opinions, the rules say. Ganapathiraju said neither he nor his co-author had yet faced punishment. “We have received emails and messages from other VAs across the country (including doctors, department chiefs, chief of medicines, and chief of staff) supporting our article,” he wrote in an email. “No communication from our local VA or from National.” Still, VA workers and veterans advocates say Friday’s warnings fit a pattern of censorship by the Trump administration, which critics say is waging a “war on science”. Since taking office, Trump administration officials have cancelled billions of dollars in grants funding medical research at the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation. Nearly 2,000 leading scientists, including dozens of Nobel Prize winners,signed an open letterreleased in April saying science was being “decimated” by cuts to research and a growing “climate of fear” that put independent research at risk. In his statement, the VA’s Kasperowicz said it is “absurd” to suggest that enforcing the agency’s media policy is part of a “war on science”. Trump issued an executive order on 23 May titled “Restoring Gold Standard Science”. It accused his predecessor, Joe Biden, of misusing scientific evidence when crafting policies on climate change, public health during the Covid-19 pandemic and other issues. Thousands of academicssigned a new open letterthat protested the move, arguing it opens the door to political interference. On 28 May, the secretary of health and human services, Robert F Kennedy Jr, said he wasconsidering barringgovernment scientists from publishing in top journals, including the Journal of the American Medical Association, the Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine, calling these publications “corrupt”. The Department of Veterans Affairs has long been one of the nation’s most important centers of medical research. Funded by Congress with nearly $1bn annually, VA scientists operate at 102 research sites and are engaged in 7,300 ongoing projects, while publishing more than 10,000 papers in scientific journals last year. VA scientistsinventedthe nicotine patch and the pacemaker and developed the CT scan. The agency runs the National Center for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, which has pioneered mental health treatments that benefit not only veterans but also rape victims and survivors of natural disasters and other violent crimes. Harold Kudler, a psychiatrist and researcher who served as the national mental health policy lead for the VA under the Obama and first Trump administrations, said the rebuke to the pulmonologists’ article was “powerful in its impact and frightening in the threat it represents”. It was “another attack on freedom of speech”, he said. “Veterans will suffer because of it. Plus, all research programs will take note.”",

    "title": "US homeland security removes list of ‘sanctuary’ cities after sheriffs’ criticism",
    "article_text": "The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) removed a list of “sanctuary” states, cities and counties from its website following sharp criticism from a sheriffs’ association that said a list of “noncompliant” sheriffs could severely damage the relationship between theTrump administrationand law enforcement. DHS on Thursday published a list of what it calledsanctuary jurisdictionsthat it deemed were included in areas that have a policy of limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The list prompted a response from the National Sheriffs’ Association, which represents more than 3,000 elected sheriffs across the country and generally supports federalimmigrationenforcement. Sheriff Kieran Donahue, president of the association, said in a statement on Saturday that DHS published “a list of alleged noncompliant sheriffs in a manner that lacks transparency and accountability”. Donahue said the list was created without input from sheriffs and “violated the core principles of trust, cooperation, and partnership with fellow law enforcement”. Donald Trump had called for his administration to tally apparent sanctuary jurisdictions, in a late April executive order, saying the lack of cooperation amounted to “a lawless insurrection”. The DHS website listing the jurisdictions was offline on Sunday, an issue that Fox News host Maria Bartiromo raised with the homeland security secretary,Kristi Noem, on the talk show Sunday Morning Futures. “I saw that there was a list produced,” Bartiromo said. “Now, the list I don’t see anymore in the media. Do you have a list of the sanctuary cities that are actually hiding illegals right now?” Noem did not acknowledge the list being taken offline but said some localities had bristled. “Some of the cities have pushed back,” Noem said. “They think because they don’t have one law or another on the books that they don’t qualify, but they do qualify. They are giving sanctuary to criminals.” Leaders of some cities publicly questioned the sanctuary label this week, including jurisdictions in southern California, Colorado and Massachusetts. San Diego city attorney Heather Ferbert told local outlets that San Diego – named on the DHS list – had never adopted a sanctuary policy and that the move appeared to be politically motivated. “We suspect this is going to be used as additional threats and fear tactics to threaten federal funding that the city relies on,” she said. Immigrant advocates and some Democrats say sanctuary policies help build trust between immigrant communities and law enforcement so that residents will be more likely to report crimes. At a hearing before a US House of Representatives committee in March, mayors from Boston, Chicago, Denver and New York City, which vote majority Democrat, said sanctuary policies made their cities safer and that they would always honor criminal arrest warrants. Noem, who shares Trump’s hardline anti-immigration views, said the department would continue to use the sanctuary tally. DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The internet archive website Wayback Machine showed the list still online on Saturday.",

    "article_text": "Russell Vought, the director of the office of management and budget (OMB), on Sunday cast doubt on the constitutional obligation of the White House to ask Congress to sign off on Donald Trump’smassive cutsto the federal workforce spearheaded byElon Musk. Vought indicated the White House preferred to rely on “executive tools” for all but a “necessary” fraction of the cuts instead of submitting the whole package of jobs and agency slashing that took place via the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), to the congressional branch for its official approval. The White House budget director, in an interview with CNN on Sunday,also defendedthe widespread future cost-cutting proposed by the US president’sOne Big Beautiful Bill actthat waspassed bythe House last week, which covers budget proposals for the next fiscal year starting in October. But, as Dana Bash, CNN’s State of the Union host, pointed out, Doge cut “funding and programs that Congress already passed”. And whilethose cuts, cited bythe departingMusk as beingworth $175bn, are tinycomparedwith the trillion or more he forecast, Vought said OMB was only going to submit about $9.4bn to Congress this week for sign-off. That amount is understood to mostly cover the crushing of theUSAID agencyand cuts to public broadcasting, which have prompted outrageand lawsuits. Leaders of Congress fromboth partieshave pressed for the Trump administration to send details of all the cuts for its approval. “Will you?” Bash asked Vought. “We might,” Vought said, adding that the rest of the Doge cuts may not need official congressional approval. As one of the architects ofProject 2025, the rightwing initiative created to guide the second Trump administration, Vought ison a questto dismantle the federal workforce and consolidate power for the US president, andto continuethe Doge cuts. Vought said that one of the executive tools the administration has is the use of “impoundment”, which involves the White House withholding specific funds allocated by Congress. Since the 1970s, a law has limited the presidency from engaging in impoundment – typically requiring the executive branch to implement what Congress signed into law. Bash said: “I know you don’t believe that that is constitutional, so are you just doing this in order to getthe supreme courtto rule that unconstitutional?” Sign up toHeadlines US Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion Vought said: “We are not in love with the law.” But he also said, in response to criticism from some on Capitol Hill: “We’re not breaking the law.” Meanwhile, on the Big Beautiful bill, the Congressional budget office (CBO) and many experts sayit could swellthe US deficit by $3.8tn, and business tycoon Musk said it “undermines the work the Doge team is doing”. Vought disagreed. “I love Elon, [but] this bill doesn’t increase the deficit or hurt the debt,” he said. Vought – and later on Sunday, the House speaker Mike Johnson on NBC – argued that critics’ calculations don’t fully account for extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts and slashing regulation. Vought also chipped in that Trump is “the architect, the visionary, the originator of his own agenda”, rather than the Heritage Foundation’s blueprint for the administration,Project 2025, although he did not deny that the two have dovetailed.",

    "title": "Six wounded in attack at Boulder rally for Israeli captives in Gaza",
    "article_text": "Police in the United States have arrested a male suspect after at least six people were wounded at an outdoor mall in the town of Boulder, Colorado, in an incident the FBI immediately described as a “targeted terror attack”. The assault took place on Sunday as demonstrators with a volunteer group called Run For Their Lives gathered to raise attention to the plight of Israeli captives who remain in Gaza. The suspect, identified as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, yelled, “Free Palestine”, and used a makeshift flamethrower in the attack, according to Mark Michalek, an FBI special agent. Soliman was taken into custody. No charges were immediately announced but officials said they expect to hold him “fully accountable”. Soliman was also injured and was taken to hospital to be treated, but authorities did not elaborate on the nature of his injuries. Police in Boulder were more circumspect about a motive. Police Chief Steve Redfearn said it “would be irresponsible” for him to speculate while witnesses were still being interviewed. But he noted that the group that had gathered in support of the captives had assembled peacefully and that the victims’ injuries – ranging from serious to minor – were consistent with them having been set on fire. The victims were aged 67 to 88, the police said. “This was a beautiful Sunday afternoon in downtown Boulder on Pearl Street, and this act was unacceptable,” Redfearn added. “I ask that you join me in thinking about the victims, the families of those victims, and everyone involved in this tragedy.” The incident comes amid heightened tensions in the US over Israel’s war in Gaza, which has spurred an increase in both anti-Semitic and Islamophobic violence. The US is Israel’s staunchest ally, arming a military that has killed more than 54,000 people in Gaza, most of whom are women and children, and imposed a blockade that has left some 2.3 million people on the verge of famine. Hamas, meanwhile, continues to hold some 58 people it took captive during the Palestinian group’s attacks in Israel on October 7, 2023. Al Jazeera’s Alan Fisher, reporting from Washington, DC, said investigations were continuing in Boulder, which is located northwest of the city of Denver. “The police received initial reports of people being set on fire at a march that has happened every weekend for the last year in support of those being held captive in Gaza,” Fisher said. “There was a man who was pictured on social media who seemed to be carrying what appears to be two bottles of liquid, and locals are saying that that was essentially petrol bombs, Molotov cocktails, which were thrown at the crowd”, he said. “The police have confirmed that some of the injuries are serious,” Fisher added. “At least two people, we are told locally, have been taken to hospital by helicopter.” Brooke Coffman, a 19-year-old at the University of Colorado who witnessed the attack, said she saw four women lying or sitting on the ground with burns on their legs. One of them appeared to have been badly burned on most of her body and had been wrapped in a flag by someone, she said. She described seeing a man whom she presumed to be the attacker standing in the courtyard shirtless, holding a glass bottle of clear liquid and shouting. “Everybody is yelling, ‘Get water, get water’,” Coffman said. Colorado Governor Jared Polis said in a statement that he was “closely monitoring” the situation, adding that “hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable”. Boulder’s Jewish community also condemned the attack. “We are saddened and heartbroken to learn that an incendiary device was thrown at walkers at the Run for Their Lives walk on Pearl Street as they were raising awareness for the hostages still held in Gaza,” members of the community said in a statement.",

    "title": "Pakistan beat Bangladesh by 7 wickets, sweep T20 series as Haris hits 107",
    "article_text": "A nerveless century from Mohammad Haris has led Pakistan’s chase of 197 runs towinthe third T20 international cricket match against Bangladesh and complete a 3-0 series win in Lahore. Having won the first two matches after choosing to bowl first, Pakistan asked the visitors to bat first in the third match on Sunday at Gaddafi Stadium in Pakistan’s eastern metropolis. Given a tricky target of 197, Pakistan lost Sahibzada Farhan – their highest scorer in the second T20I – in the first over to Mehidy Hasan Miraz. While the Pakistan of old may have crumbled under the pressure of losing a quick wicket, the new-look side under young captain Salman Agha and freshly-appointed coach Mike Hesson kept up their scoring rate. Saim Ayub and Haris formed a 92-run partnership as they took on the Bangladeshi bowling attack to maintain a high scoring rate and keep the target within sight. Ayub was dismissed in the 10th over by Tanzim Hasan Sakib after scoring 45 runs off 29 balls, but by then, Haris had taken on the role of the main hitter and kept the big shots coming. The wicketkeeper-batter hit seven sixes and eight fours in his 46-ball 107, which kept Bangladesh out of contention for most of Pakistan’s innings. He was all smiles as he accepted the Player of the Match award and said that despite not performing well for Pakistan in the recent past, he kept working hard. “I tried to learn from my mistakes and didn’t want to waste this opportunity that I got to play in this series,” he said. Haris added that he batted with the simple plan of “see ball, play ball” and didn’t want to play any unnecessary shots. Earlier, Bangladesh’s innings had got off to a swift start when Parvez Hossain Emon and Tanzid Hasan overpowered Pakistan’s opening bowlers Ayub and Faheem Ashraf. They set up an opening stand of 110, but the Bangladeshi batting lineup derailed soon after Tanzid’s departure in the 11th over. Despite starts from captain Litton Das (22 runs) and Towhid Hridoy (25 runs), the Tigers were unable to maintain the scoring rate set by the openers. A total of 196-6 in 20 overs ensured the home team faced some pressure when they came out to bat, but Pakistan’s array of attacking batters disregarded scoreboard pressure and took their team home with 16 balls to spare. Pakistan captain Salman, who was on the pitch with Haris when the winning runs were scored, said he was delighted with his team’s consistency. “We want to test ourselves where things become difficult, and we wanted to chase to put the boys under pressure,” Salman explained after the match. The 3-0 series sweep was Pakistan’s first since 2021.",

    "title": "Aid ship aiming to break Israel’s siege of Gaza sets sail from Italy",
    "article_text": "International nonprofit organisation Freedom Flotilla Coalition (FFC) says one of its vessels has left Sicily to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza, after a previous attempt failed due to a drone attack on a different ship in the Mediterranean. The 12-person crew, which includes Swedishclimate activist Greta Thunberg, Irish actor Liam Cunningham and Franco-Palestinian MEP Rima Hassan, set sail on the Madleen from the port of Catania on Sunday, carrying barrels of relief supplies that the group called “limited amounts, though symbolic”. The voyage comes after another vessel operated by the group, the Conscience, washit by two dronesjust outside Maltese territorial waters in early May. While FFC said Israel was to blame for the incident, it has not responded to requests for comment. “We are doing this because no matter what odds we are against, we have to keep trying, because the moment we stop trying is when we lose our humanity,” Thunberg told reporters at a news conference before the departure. The Swedish climate activist had been due to board the Conscience. She added that “no matter how dangerous this mission is, it is nowhere near as dangerous as the silence of the entire world in the face of the lives being genocised”. 🇵🇸 ⛵️ Avec@GretaThunbergnous appelons à la mobilisation citoyenne pour soutenir massivement le navire humanitaire de@GazaFFlotilla! C’est le seul moyen de garantir notre sécurité. 🙏pic.twitter.com/5DUJbkRdPZ — Rima Hassan (@RimaHas)June 1, 2025 The activists expect to take seven days to reach their destination, if they are not stopped. The FCC, launched in 2010, is a non-violent international movement supporting Palestinians, combining humanitarian aid with political protest against the blockade on Gaza. It said the trip “is not charity. This is a non-violent, direct action to challenge Israel’s illegal siege and escalating war crimes”. United Nations agencies and major aid groups say Israeli restrictions, the breakdown of law and order, and widespread looting make it extremely difficult to deliver aid to Gaza’s roughly two million inhabitants. The situation in Gaza is at its worst since the war between Israel and Hamas began 19 months ago, the UN said on Friday, despite a resumption of limited aid deliveries in the Palestinian enclave. Under growing global pressure, Israel ended an 11-week blockade on Gaza on May 19, allowing extremely limited UN-led operations to resume. On Monday, a new avenue for aid distribution was also launched: the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, backed by the United States and Israel, but withthe UN and international aid groups refusing to work with it, saying it is not neutral and has a distribution model that forces the displacement of Palestinians. The FCC is the latest among a growing number of critics to accuse Israel of genocidal acts in its war in Gaza, allegations Israel vehemently denies. “We are breaking the siege of Gaza by sea, but that’s part of a broader strategy of mobilisations that will also attempt to break the siege by land,” said activist Thiago Avila. Avila also mentioned the upcoming Global March to Gaza – an international initiative also open to doctors, lawyers and members of the media – which is set to leave Egypt and reach the Rafah crossing in mid-June to stage a protest there, calling on Israel to stop the Gaza offensive and reopen the border.",

    "title": "Ukrainian drones target Russian airbases in unprecedented operation",
    "article_text": "Officials say multiple military airbases deep inside Russia have come under drone attacks in a major Ukrainian operation ahead ofpeace talksdue to start in Istanbul on Monday. The Russian Defence Ministry said Ukraine had launched drone strikes targeting Russian military airfields across five regions on Sunday, causing several aircraft to catch fire. The attacks occurred in the Murmansk, Irkutsk, Ivanovo, Ryazan, and Amur regions. Air defences repelled the assaults in all but two regions – Murmansk and Irkutsk, the ministry said. “In the Murmansk and Irkutsk regions, the launch of FPV drones from an area in close proximity to airfields resulted in several aircraft catching fire,” the ministry said. The fires were extinguished and no casualties were reported. Some individuals involved in the attacks had been detained, the ministry said. On Sunday night, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised the “absolutely brilliant” Ukrainian drone attack, saying it inflicted tangible losses on Moscow. “An absolutely brilliant outcome. And an outcome produced by Ukraine independently,” Zelenskyy wrote on the Telegram messaging app, noting that the operation had taken more than a year and half to prepare. “This is our longest-range operation.” Speaking shortly afterwards in his nightly video address, the president said 117 drones had been used to attack the Russian bases. “Russia has had very tangible losses, and justifiably so,” he said. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said on Sunday that it had hit Russian military planes worth a combined $7bn in a wave of drone strikes on Russian air bases thousands of kilometres behind the front lines. “$7 billion: This is the estimated cost of the enemy’s strategic aviation, which was hit today as a result of the SBU’s special operation,” the agency said in a social media post. Targets included the Belaya airbase in Irkutsk, about 4,300km (2,670 miles) from the Ukrainian border, and the Olenya airbase in south Murmansk, some 1,800km (1,120 miles) from Ukraine. Earlier on Sunday, multiple local media reports in Ukraine, including those by state news agency Ukrinform, cited a source within the SBU saying the coordinated attacks inside Russia were “aimed at destroying enemy bombers far from the front”. They said the operation was carried out by the SBU using drones smuggled deep into Russia and hidden inside trucks. At least 41 Russian heavy bombers at four airbases were hit, the reports said. “According to witnesses on the ground and local officials, these drones were launched from sites near the airbases. That means this was an elaborate operation … that involved a number of people inside Russia,” Al Jazeera’s Dorsa Jabbari said, reporting from Moscow. “This is the single largest attack that we’ve seen in one day across multiple military airbases inside Russia since the war began in February of 2022,” Jabbari said, noting that the airbases are home to Russia’s strategic air bombers, which have been used to attack targets across Ukraine over the past three years. Al Jazeera’s John Hendren, reporting from Kyiv, said it’s “an audacious strike, one that Ukraine has been waiting a long time and patiently to deliver, and it’s come after Russian air strikes into Ukraine have dramatically accelerated over the past couple of weeks”. Meanwhile, at least seven people were killed and 69 injured when a highway bridge in Russia’s Bryansk region, neighbouring Ukraine,was blown upwhile a passenger train heading to Moscow was crossing it with 388 people on board. No one has yet claimed responsibility. Russian officials said they were treating the incident as an “act of terrorism” but did not immediately accuse Ukraine. The developments came as Russia also said it had advanced deeper into the Sumy region of Ukraine, and as open-source pro-Ukrainian maps showed Russia took 450sq km (174sq miles) of Ukrainian land in May, its fastest monthly advance in at least six months. Moscow launched 472 drones at Ukraine overnight, Ukraine’s Air Force said, the highest nightly total of the war so far. Russia had also launched seven missiles, the Air Force said. Both parties sharplyramped up their attacksas Ukraine confirmed it will send a delegation to Istanbul led by its Defence Minister Rustem Umerov for talks on Monday with Russian officials. Turkiye is hosting the meeting, which was spurred by US President Donald Trump’s push for a quick deal to end the three-year war. Zelenskyy, who previously voiced scepticism about the seriousness of the Russian side in engaging in Monday’s meeting, said he had defined the Ukrainian delegation’s position on the talks. Priorities included “a complete and unconditional ceasefire” and the return of prisoners and abducted children, he said on social media. Russia has said it has formulated its own peace terms, but refused to divulge them in advance. Russian President Vladimir Putin also ruled out a Turkish proposal for the meeting to be held at the leaders’ level.",

    "title": "F1 Spanish GP: Piastri beats Norris as Verstappen receives late penalty",
    "article_text": "Formula One championship leader Oscar Piastri has won the Spanish Grand Prix from pole position in a McLaren one-two to go 10 points clear of teammate Lando Norris in the world championship title battle. The Australian’s win on Sunday by 2.4 seconds over Norris was his fifth in nine races this season and McLaren’s seventh. Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc completed the podium places on Sunday after passing Max Verstappen’s Red Bull six laps from the end following a safety car period that triggered the main talking point of the afternoon with the champion demoted from fifth to 10th place. “It’s a nice way to bounce back from Monaco. A superb weekend,” said Piastri, who finished third last weekend in a race won from pole by Norris. Verstappen, who made four stops in total and ended up on the slower hard tyres against rivals on softs, collided with Leclerc and twice with Mercedes’s George Russell after the safety car restart. The Dutch driver was given a 10-second penalty – added to his overall time post-race – for the second Russell collision, which was clearly his fault. He and Leclerc also faced a post-race investigation for their clash, which could lead to further sanctions. “I tried to push him to the left. There was a bit of contact but fortunately no consequences,” Leclerc said. Verstappen claimed the Monegasque had rammed into him and should have given back the place. Russell finished fourth after eventually being let through by Verstappen, who reluctantly did as his team told him. Sauber’s Nico Hulkenberg finished a surprising and morale-boosting fifth for the future Audi team after passing Ferrari’s seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton on the penultimate lap. Hamilton was a disappointing sixth, Isack Hadjar seventh for Racing Bulls and Pierre Gasly eighth for Renault-owned Alpine. Home hero Fernando Alonso scored his first points of the season with Aston Martin, who had only one car on the grid due to Lance Stroll’s withdrawal through injury after Saturday’s qualifying. Piastri led away cleanly at the start with Verstappen seizing second from Norris while Hamilton and Leclerc moved up to fourth and fifth at the expense of Russell. Hamilton let Leclerc through on lap 10 of 66 after the two Ferraris had run nose to tail. Norris took back second place from Verstappen on lap 13 with the Dutch driver making no attempt to defend against the quicker McLaren and pitting on the next lap for new tyres. Verstappen took the lead again on lap 23 after Piastri pitted. Norris made his first stop on lap 21 and came out behind the Red Bull, but that lasted only until Verstappen pitted for a second time on lap 30. Verstappen came in for a third stop on lap 47, and Norris pitted a lap later to defend second place. A safety car was deployed on lap 55 after rookie driver Kimi Antonelli beached his Mercedes in the gravel, bunching up the field and triggering a rash of pit stops. The McLarens came in together for new tyres, double-stacking, and comfortably resumed ahead of Verstappen, who questioned the switch to a set of hards but was told that was the only option available. The next round of the 2025 season will be the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal on June 15.",

    "title": "India general admits jet losses in clash with Pakistan: Here’s what he said",
    "article_text": "General Anil Chauhan, India’s chief of defence staff, has admitted that an unspecified number offighter jets were shot downduring its conflict with Pakistan last month. The acknowledgement of aerial losses by the country’s highest ranking general comes weeks after the two South Asian neighbours were engaged in their heaviest fighting in decades, which involved fighter jets and cruise missiles. Indian officials had previously refused to confirm or deny Pakistani claims of downing Indian jets.The conflict was triggered after gunmen killed 26 tourists in India-administered Kashmir’s Pahalgam town on April 22. India’s first official admission of a loss of fighter jets came during Chauhan’s interviews on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue security forum in Singapore. India carried out strikes on what it called “terror infrastructure” in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir on May 7 in retaliation for the Pahalgam attack. India blamed armed groups backed by Pakistan for the April 22 attack. An armed group calledThe Resistance Front (TRF)claimed responsibility for the Pahalgam killings. India accused the TRF of being an offshoot of the Pakistan-based armed group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). Pakistan denied involvement, condemning the Pahalgam attack and calling for a neutral investigation. India claimed to have targeted at least six cities in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir on the first day of the conflict. Pakistan initially asserted that it had downed six Indian fighter jets in retaliation. But a senior Pakistan officialtold Al Jazeerafive Indian aircraft were lost in the aerial battle. India did not confirm or deny the Pakistani claims. “Losses are a part of combat,” Air Marshal AK Bharti, India’s director general of air operations, said at a news conference on May 11. The Indian embassy in China called reports of the downing of jets “disinformation”. After that, tit-for-tat cross-border attacks across the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border between India- and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, rattled the region, renewing fears of a nuclear war. On May 10, United States President Donald Trump announced that the two countries had reached a ceasefire, potentially averting a “nuclear disaster”. India and Pakistan have given competing claims on casualties in the fighting, but more than 70 people were killed on both sides. Both India and Pakistan claim Kashmir in full but administer only parts of the Muslim-majority Himalayan territory. Here is what Chauhan said in recent interviews with the Reuters news agency and Bloomberg TV: Chauhan admitted that India suffered air losses on the first day of fighting without giving details. In an interview with Reuters, he said: “What was important is why did these losses occur and what we’ll do after that.” The Indian general said that after the losses, the Indian army “rectified tactics” and then went back on May 7, 8 and 10 “in large numbers to hit airbases deep inside Pakistan, penetrated all their air defences with impunity, carried out precision strikes”. He added that the Indian air force “flew all types of aircraft with all types of ordnances” on May 10. Islamabad acknowledged that its airbases suffered some minimal losses but denied that it lost any planes. When a Bloomberg reporter asked Chauhan about Pakistan’s claims that six Indian jets were downed, Chauhan responded that this information was incorrect. He went on to say: “What is important is … not the jets being downed but why they were downed.” Some media outlets inferred that his statement appeared to imply that a number of jets were lost in the aerial battle. The general did not provide details about the number of jets downed or specifics about what these rectified tactics were. The Pakistani military said India did not fly its fighter jets in the conflict again after suffering the air losses. Media reports suggested that some attacks were near Pakistan’s nuclear sites but the nuclear infrastructure itself was not a target. “Most of the strikes were delivered with pinpoint accuracy, some even to a metre [3.3ft] to whatever was our selected mean point of impact,” Chauhan said in the interview with Reuters. Chauhan had previously provided assurances that India was not considering using nuclear weapons during the conflict. The chairman of Pakistan’s joint chiefs of staff, General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, has done the same for his country. “I think there’s a lot of space before that nuclear threshold is crossed, a lot of signalling before that. I think nothing like that happened. There’s a lot of space for conventional operations which has been created, and this will be the new norm,” Chauhan said. The Indian general added that on both sides, the most “rational people are in uniform” during conflict because they understand the consequences of “this kind of conflict”. “I found both sides displaying a lot of rationality in their thoughts as well as actions. So why should we assume that in the nuclear domain there will be irrationality on someone else’s part?” The Indian chief of defence staff said that while Pakistan enjoys a close alliance with China, there was no sign that Beijing helped Islamabad during the conflict. China sits on India’s northern and eastern borders and controls a barely inhabited northeastern zone in Kashmir called Aksai Chin. “We didn’t find any unusual activity in the operational or tactical depth of our northern borders, and things were generally all right,” Chauhan said. When Chauhan was asked whether China provided Pakistan with intelligence information such as satellite imagery, the Indian general responded by saying that such information is commercially available and Pakistan could have obtained it from China or other sources. However, Chauhan said “almost 80 percent of the equipment” in Pakistan has been procured from China in the past few years. From 2020 to 2025, China supplied81 percentof Pakistan’s arms imports, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Chinese jets got a boost after media reports said Pakistan used Chinese-manufactured J-10C fighter jets in the air battle. The Chinese government did not officially confirm that the J-10C jets were used to down Indian jets, but China Central Television, a state broadcaster, posted on social media on May 17 that the jets achieved actual combat results for the first time. Chauhan said that while hostilities have ceased, India would “respond precisely and decisively should there be any further terror attacks emanating from Pakistan”. He added that this will be a new normal for India. “So that has its own dynamics as far [as] the armed forces are concerned. It will require us to be prepared 24/7.” The president of the main opposition Indian National Congress party said Chauhan’s admission warrants a review of India’s defence preparedness. “There are some very important questions which need to be asked. These can only be asked if a Special Session of the Parliament is immediately convened,” Mallikarjun Kharge wrote in an X post on Saturday. Referring to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he added: “The Modi Govt has misled the nation. The fog of war is now clearing.” “We salute [the Indian military’s] resolute courage and bravery,” Kharge said. “However, a comprehensive strategic review is the need of the hour.” The Congress party has called the Pahalgam attack a “security and intelligence failure” and sought accountability, given that India-administered Kashmir is directly governed from New Delhi.",

    "title": "Saudi Arabia calls Israel barring Arab ministers West Bank trip ‘extremism’",
    "article_text": "Saudi Arabia has accused Israel of “extremism and rejection of peace” after it blocked a planned visit by Arab foreign ministers to the occupied West Bank. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud made the remarks during a joint news conference in Jordan’s capital, Amman, on Sunday with his counterparts from Jordan, Egypt, and Bahrain. “Israel’s refusal of the committee’s visit to the West Bank embodies and confirms its extremism and refusal of any serious attempts for [a] peaceful pathway … It strengthens our will to double our diplomatic efforts within the international community to face this arrogance,” Prince Faisal said. His comments followed Israel’s decision toblock the Arab delegationfrom reaching Ramallah, where they were set to meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. The ministers from Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) had planned the visit as part of efforts to support Palestinian diplomacy amid Israel’s ongoing war on Gaza. Israel controls the airspace and borders of the West Bank, and on Friday announced it would not grant permission for the visit. “The Palestinian Authority – which to this day refuses to condemn the October 7 massacre – intended to host in Ramallah a provocative meeting of foreign ministers from Arab countries to discuss the promotion of the establishment of a Palestinian state,” an Israeli official had said, adding that Israel will “not cooperate” with the visit. Prince Faisal’s trip to theWest Bankwould have marked the first such visit by a top Saudi official in recent memory. Jordan’s Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said blocking the trip was another example of how Israel was “killing any chance of a just and comprehensive” Arab-Israeli settlement. An international conference, co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, is due to be held in New York from June 17 to 20 to discuss the issue of Palestinian statehood. Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty said the conference would cover security arrangements after aceasefire in Gazaand reconstruction plans to ensure Palestinians would remain on their land and foil any Israeli plans to evict them. Israel has come under increasing pressure from the United Nations and European countries, which favour a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, under which an independent Palestinian state would exist alongside Israel.",

    "title": "Why Hamas is seeking to change the US-proposed Gaza ceasefire deal",
    "article_text": "Palestinian group Hamas claims a recent ceasefire proposal passed to them by United States special envoy Steve Witkoff is different from one they had agreed to a week earlier. Basem Naim, a leading Hamas official, told Al Jazeera on Saturday that the group “responded positively” to the latest proposal relayed by Witkoff, even though it offered “no guarantees to end the war”, according to Naim. Israel has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians since October 2023, and its total aid blockade since March has caused starvation and a famine-like situation in Gaza, home to 2.3 million people, most of whom were displaced by 19 months of relentless bombardment. Amid international pressure, Israel has allowed a trickle of aid into Gaza, which has been described as a “drop in an ocean” by humanitarian groups. Here’s what you need to know about the ceasefire proposal. According to the group, no. It says it responded positively but added a few key provisions. There are a few. Hamas has responded to the latest US-proposed ceasefire with demands for a pathway to a permanent ceasefire, instead of a temporary one where the Israeli government could unilaterally restart hostilities as they did in March. They have also called for a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip and the resumption of aid and assistance to the besieged area. Witkoff proposed a 60-day pause in hostilities. After that, the parties (Israel and Hamas) would work to agree to extend the pause. The issue with this is that the last time it happened, Israel unilaterally decided to cut aid to Gaza and started bombing it. To avoid a similar scenario, Hamas has tried to negotiate on the timeline for releasing the captives, 10 of them alive and 18 bodies of those killed during the war. Witkoff’s proposal called for the release to take place within a week of the 60-day pause. However, Hamas fears Israel will resume its bombing campaign upon the release of the captives, so it has called for staggering their release throughout the pause. It has called for a set list of negotiation topics to avoid what has happened in past negotiations with Israel, where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu added provisions in what critics say was an attempt to derail talks and prolong the war. According to the website Drop Site News, Hamas also reinserted a provision from the May 25 agreement that Israel had withdrawn. That provision would be for Hamas to hand over the governing of Gaza to “an independent technocratic committee”. Witkoff called Hamas’s response “totally unacceptable” and said it “only takes us backward”. “Hamas should accept the framework proposal we put forward as the basis for proximity talks, which we can begin immediately this coming week,” he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “That is the only way we can close a 60-day ceasefire deal in the coming days in which half of the living hostages and half of those who are deceased will come home to their families and in which we can have at the proximity talks substantive negotiations in good-faith to try to reach a permanent ceasefire.” I received the Hamas response to the United States’ proposal. It is totally unacceptable and only takes us backward. Hamas should accept the framework proposal we put forward as the basis for proximity talks, which we can begin immediately this coming week. That is the only… — Office of the Special Envoy to the Middle East (@SE_MiddleEast)May 31, 2025 US President Donald Trump previously said the two sides were nearing a deal. The US and Israel seem to be in agreement on the terms. Israel claims its officials agreed with the US proposal for a 60-day ceasefire. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Israel “backed and supported” the new proposal. Netanyahu criticised the Hamas response, parroting Witkoff and laying the blame on the Palestinian group for failing to accept the proposal. “As Witkoff said, Hamas’s response is unacceptable and sets the situation back. Israel will continue its action for the return of our hostages and the defeat of Hamas,” Netanyahu said. Hamas is wary of past instances where Israel chose to unilaterally break the ceasefire. That happened in March, when Netanyahu decided to block all aid from entering Gaza and restart the war. Tamer Qarmout, an associate professor at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, described the negotiations between Hamas and Israel as taking place with “no good faith whatsoever”. “They [Israel] are fixated on one key goal, which is Hamas’s capitulation and surrender, and disappearing from the scene,” Qarmout told Al Jazeera. “Hamas is engaged in these negotiations just to try to reduce the horrors of the war, to allow some humanitarian aid to enter and to also look for a dignified exit. No one in Hamas wants to see themselves surrendering this way.” In the interim, Israel is continuing to attack Gaza. On Sunday, Israeli forces opened fire on Palestinians who had gathered at aid distribution sites run by a US-backed group, Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, in southern and central Gaza. At least 31 people were killed in Rafah and another near the Netzarim Corridor. Meanwhile,residential homes across Gazaare still being bombed relentlessly.",

    "title": "Bus plunges off bridge in northern Nigeria, killing 22 athletes",
    "article_text": "A bus crash in Nigeria’s northern state of Kano has killed 22 athletes returning home from a national sports event, according to the local governor. The bus, which was reportedly carrying more than 30 passengers, plunged off the Chiromawa Bridge on the Kano-Zaria expressway on Saturday, Kano Governor Abba Kabir Yusuf told The Associated Press news agency. The exact cause of the accident was not known, but the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) said it “might have occurred as a result of fatigue and excessive speed” after a long overnight trip. The survivors of the crash were taken to a local hospital for treatment. Yusuf said the athletes, who were accompanied by their coaches and sporting officials, were representing Kano State at the Nigerian National Sports Festival, held about 1,000km (620 miles) to the south in Ogun State. He declared Monday a day of mourning for the state. His deputy, Aminu Gwarzo, said the families of the victims would receive 1 million naira (about $630) and food supplies as support. The National Association of Nigerian Students released a statement, Nigerian daily The Guardian reported, saying the “heartbreaking” incident had “cast a shadow of grief over the entire nation, particularly the youth and sports communities”. Road accidents are common in Africa’s most populous country, in part due to poor road conditions and lax enforcement of traffic laws. In March, at least six people died near the capital, Abuja, after a trailer crashed into parked vehicles and burst into flames. Last year, Nigeria recorded 9,570 road accidents that resulted in 5,421 deaths, according to FRSC data. The Nigerian National Sports Festival brings together athletes from the country’s 35 states every two years. Nigeria’s President Bola Tinubu recently said the games, which include sports ranging from wheelchair basketball to traditional West African wrestling, represent “the unity, strength and resilience that define us as a nation”.",

If you or a loved one is experiencing suicidal thoughts, help and support are available.Visit Befrienders Internationalfor more information about support services. When I was a child, I would spend each summer with my family in the foothills of northern Pakistan's Karakoram mountains. We would spend our days exploring the verdant meadows, forests and lakes in this region known as the \"roof of the world\" and then return to our lodge for meals of chargha (fire-roasted chicken) and naan, hot tea, coconut biscuits, cashews and dried fruits. At night, we'd make bonfires and tell stories about our family spread all over the world. I remember how tiny I felt sitting wrapped in a woollen Kashmiri shawl on those chilly nights, sitting under skies full of stars. Those trips always carried a sense of adventure - and freedom. One day during one of those summer holidays when I was 12, my Aunt Naseem went for a walk and I tagged along. She was my mentor and confidant and, having never had children of her own, was like a mother to me. That day, we headed to the Neelam River separating Pakistan-administered Kashmir from Indian-administered Kashmir. We walked along the riverbank beside the clear river. We were so close to the border that we could see the Indian army posts, their guns pointed in our direction. Arriving at a higher point, we stood in the Neelum Valley. It had rained earlier and now the air was fresh. Snow-capped peaks rose in the distance. I remember my aunt pulling me into the warmth of her shawl. \"Once here, Tariq, you never actually leave. A part of you will always stay in the north, always beckoning,” she told me. Her words enchanted me. \"You don't believe me,” she said, her smile widening. \"Shout out your name and see what happens.\" I shouted - as loud as I could. Then it came: an echo that seemed to say my name over and over into the distance. \"Now you see. The mountains are too high. They will never let Tariq leave,\" my aunt told me.",

    "title": "UK plans $2bn weapons upgrade as Starmer calls for ‘war readiness’",
    "article_text": "Prime Minister Keir Starmer has warned the United Kingdom must be prepared to confront and defeat hostile states with modern military capabilities, as his government unveils a 1.5-billion-pound (about $2bn) plan to build at least six new weapons and explosives factories. “We are being directly threatened by states with advanced military forces, so we must be ready to fight and win,” Starmer wrote in The Sun newspaper on Sunday. “We will restore Britain’s war-fighting readiness as the central purpose of our armed forces.” The announcement came in advance of a Strategic Defence Review (SDR), which Starmer is set to publish on Monday. The review will assess threats facing the UK amid the ongoingRussia-Ukraine warand pressure from United States President Donald Trump forNATO alliesto bolster their defences. European nations have rushed to strengthen theirarmed forcesin recent months, following Trump’s comments that Europe must shoulder more responsibility for its security. Defence Secretary John Healey, speaking to the BBC network, said the planned investment signals a clear warning to Moscow and would also help revive the UK’s sluggish economy. “We are in a world that is changing now … and it is a world of growing threats,” Healey told the BBC on Sunday. “It’s growing Russian aggression. It’s those daily cyberattacks, it’s new nuclear risks, and it’s increasing tension in other parts of the world as well.” The UK’s Ministry of Defence confirmed the funds would support the domestic production of up to 7,000 long-range missiles. With this package, its total munitions spending will reach approximately 6 billion pounds (nearly $8bn) during the current parliamentary term. Meanwhile, The Sunday Times reported that the government is eyeing US-built jets capable of launching tactical nuclear weapons, although the UK’s Defence Ministry has yet to comment. The forthcoming SDR, ordered after the Labour Party’s election win in July 2024, will outline emerging threats and the military capabilities required to address them. Starmer has pledged to raise defence spending to 2.5 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) by 2027, with an eventual aim of reaching 3 percent. The arms initiative follows earlier government pledges to invest 1 billion pounds ($1.3bn) in artificial intelligence technology for battlefield decision-making and an additional 1.5 billion pounds (about $2bn) to improve housing conditions for armed forces personnel.",

    "title": "Bangladesh Supreme Court lifts ban on Jamaat-e-Islami party",
    "article_text": "Bangladesh has restored the registration of the country’s largest Muslim party, more than a decade after it was banned by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government. Sunday’s Supreme Court decision means the Jamaat-e-Islami party can now be formally listed with the Election Commission, paving the way for its participation in the next general election, which theinterim governmenthas promised to hold by June next year. Jamaat-e-Islami lawyer Shishir Monir said the ruling would allow a “democratic, inclusive and multiparty system” in the Muslim-majority country of 170 million people. “We hope that Bangladeshis, regardless of their ethnicity or religious identity, will vote for Jamaat and that the parliament will be vibrant with constructive debates,” Monir told journalists. The party had appealed for a review of a2013 high court ordercancelling its registration after Hasina’s government was ousted in August by a student-led nationwide uprising. Hasina, 77, fled to India and is now being tried in absentia over her crackdown last year, described by prosecutors as a “systematic attack” on protesters, which according to the United Nations, killed up to 1,400 people. The Supreme Court decision on Jamaat-e-Islami came after it overturned a conviction against ATM Azharul Islam, one of the party’s key leaders, on Tuesday. Islam was sentenced to death in 2014 for rape, murder and genocide during Bangladesh’s 1971 war of independence from Pakistan. Jamaat-e-Islami supported Pakistan during the war, a role that still sparks anger among many Bangladeshis today. “We, as individuals or as a party, are not beyond making mistakes,” Jamaat-e-Islami leader Shafiqur Rahman said after Islam’s conviction was overturned without specifying what he was referring to. “We seek your pardon if we have done anything wrong,” he said. The party’s members were rivals of Hasina’s father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman of the Awami League, who would become Bangladesh’s founding president. Hasina banned Jamaat-e-Islami during her tenure and cracked down on its leaders. In May, Bangladesh’s interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus,bannedthe Awami League, pending the outcome of legal proceedings over its crackdown on last year’s mass protests.",

    "title": "Nigeria flash floods: Which is most affected area, what caused the deluge?",
    "article_text": "Flash floods triggered by heavy rains have devastated a central Nigerian state,killing at least 150people and displacing thousands since Thursday, and rescue workers say the toll could rise. Search and rescue operations are ongoing as roads have been damaged and homes destroyed while bodies are believed to have been swept down the Niger River. Here is what to know about the floods and how prone Nigeria is to such events. Flash floods hit Mokwa, a market town located in Nigeria’s north-central Niger State. It followedintense rainfallthat began about 3am (02:00 GMT) on Thursday, according to the Nigerian Red Cross Society. Mokwa is a key meeting and transit point for traders from the south and food growers in the north. It is about 350km (217 miles) by road east of Nigeria’s capital, Abuja. Mokwa has an estimatedpopulationof 400,000 while Niger is the country’s fourth largest state by size, covering more area than Belgium or Switzerland. More than 150 people have been confirmed killed while rescue teams continue to recover bodies and search for missing people. The actual death toll islikely higheras many victims are believed to have been swept down the Niger River, Al Jazeera’s Ahmed Idris said, reporting from Mokwa. “The usual thing is when an official tells you 151 are dead or missing, you are likely to multiply that by two, three or four,” he said. At least 3,018 people have been displaced, 265 houses destroyed and two bridges washed away in the floods, according to Ibrahim Audu Husseini, a spokesman for the Niger State Emergency Management Agency. Of those injured, 121 were in hospital, and more than 100 people were missing, Gideon Adamu, head of the Red Cross in Niger State, told the AFP news agency on Saturday. “We can’t give up the search as long as there are families crying out,” Adamu said. Farida Auwalu, the lone survivor from a family of 16, lost seven children in the deluge. The bodies of four of Farida’s children have been found and buried. “My hope is to see the remaining bodies and give them a decent burial and have closure,” she told Al Jazeera. Experts said the frequency and severity of floods in Nigeria have increased due to climate change, unregulated construction and poor drainage infrastructure. Mokwa residents also believe the flooding was caused by “a bigger problem upstream, maybe a dam burst, but up to now, officials are not confirming that”, Idris said. Niger State has three major dams – Kainji, Jebba and Shiroro – while a fourth is under construction. Despite flood risks being identified, there has been a lack of political will to implement the solutions for them, according to Ugonna Nkwunonwo, a flood risk analyst at the University of Nigeria. “The amount of rain you expect in a year could probably come in one or two months, and people are not prepared for that kind of rainfall,” he told Al Jazeera. Many areas in the countrylack proper drainagesystems, and existing ones are often clogged with waste, causing water to accumulate on the streets during heavy rains. Additionally, rapid urban development without proper planning has led to the construction of buildings in flood-prone areas, reducing the land’s natural ability to absorb water. Deforestation for agriculture and development further reduces the land’s capacity to soak up rainfall, increasing the flow of water over the land. Local leaders and residents are calling for state and federal authorities to intervene with long-term support and infrastructure to rebuild their communities and protect them from flooding. “Warnings have been put out by authorities for people exposed or communities living along river banks to move to higher ground, especially when the rains start to peak, but every year, we continue to see more and more lives and property damaged because of rainfall,” Idris said. Emergency services – including the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), the Niger State Emergency Management Agency, the Nigerian Red Cross and local volunteers – are engaged in search and rescue operations. President Bola Tinubu has also ordered an emergency response, including the provision of aid and temporary shelter. “Search-and-rescue operations are ongoing, and all relevant federal agencies have been mobilised to support the state government’s efforts,” Tinubu wrote in a social media post on Saturday. However, damaged roads and bridges have complicated rescue and recovery efforts. Some flood survivors are struggling to get basic aid. “No one brought any money or food to help the victims. As you can see, many don’t have a place to sleep,” Hassan Umar told Al Jazeera in Mokwa. A key bridge that connects the northern and southwestern parts of the country collapsed, leaving motorists stranded and disrupting movement of vehicles across the region. In September, severe flooding in the northwestern city ofMaiduguriin Borno State submerged two-thirds of the city, killed at least 30 people and displaced nearly half a million. More than 200 inmates also escaped from a flood-damaged prison. The disaster was triggered by weeks of intense rainfall and the collapse of the Alau dam in northeastern Nigeria. Across the country in 2024, flooding killed more than 1,200 people and displaced1.2 millionin at least 31 of 36 states, according to NEMA. The Nigerian Meteorological Agency has warned of possible flash floods in 15 of Nigeria’s 36 states, including Niger, from Wednesday to Friday. In the south, low-lying states like Bayelsa, Rivers and Delta in the Niger Delta region experience frequent flooding due to their coastal locations. In the north, Kogi, Benue and Borno states are also prone to floods because they are on major rivers. The country’srainy seasontypically begins in April to mid-May and lasts through October while August is the wettest month. Heavy rainfall during this period causes problems every year because it destroys infrastructure and is exacerbated by inadequate drainage. Although flooding is common during Nigeria’s rainy season, now is not the peak of the rains, Idris said. “In some states, the rains have only been there for a month, and yet we’re seeing this.”",

    "title": "At least 30 killed in India’s northeast as rains trigger floods, landslides",
    "article_text": "At least 30 people have died in India’s northeast after relentless monsoon rains caused floods and landslides over the weekend, Indian officials and media reports say. Authorities on Sunday said at least eight people were killed in Assam state and nine more in neighbouring Arunachal Pradesh, many of them buried under earth and debris dislodged by the torrential downpour. Three members of one family were killed in a mudslide in Assam’s Guwahati, officials said, as heavy rains led to flooding in many areas of the city, leading to long power outages and prompting authorities to shut schools and colleges on Saturday. Authorities disconnected electricity in several areas to reduce the risk of electrocution, Assam’s Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said. In Mizoram state, five people lost their lives in a landslide, while six others died in Meghalaya state. Officials in Nagaland and Tripura states also confirmed two deaths. Meghalaya’s Chief Minister Conrad K Sangma ordered emergency teams to stay vigilant, “especially in landslide-prone and low-lying areas”, he warned in a public statement. The Indian Army launched a large-scale rescue effort in Manipur state, evacuating hundreds. “People have been shifted to safer places,” the army said. “Food, water and essential medicines were provided.” The downpour has continued for three straight days, and India’s weather agency has forecast more heavy rains in the region in the coming days as it issued a red alert for several northeastern districts. Rivers across the region, including the Brahmaputra, which originates in the Himalayas and flows through India into Bangladesh, have breached their banks, submerging vast areas and cutting off access to many communities. Floods and landslides are common during India’s June-to-September monsoon season, which is vital for agriculture but often deadly. Dozens of people die each year as rainfall overwhelms fragile infrastructure across the world’s most populous country. Last month,Mumbai was deluged by rainnearly two weeks before its usual beginning, the earliest monsoon arrival in the capital city of the western state of Maharashtra in over two decades, according to meteorological officials. Scientists sayclimate changeis altering weather patterns across South Asia, but the precise effects on the monsoon system remain unclear.",

    "title": "Israel kills 32 Palestinians waiting for food at US-backed Gaza aid sites",
    "article_text": "Israel has killed at least 32 Palestinians waiting to get food at two aid distribution sites in Gaza, leaving more than 200 others injured. Israeli tanksopened fireon thousands of civilians gathered at a distribution site in southern Gaza’s Rafah on Sunday morning, killing at least 31 people, according to Gaza’s Government Media Office. Soon after, another person was killed in a shooting at a similar distribution point south of the Netzarim Corridor in Gaza City, it said in a statement on Telegram. The aid is being distributed by Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a controversial group backed by Israel and the United States, which has completed a chaotic first week of operations in the enclave. GHF executive director, US veteran Jake Woods, resigned before the distribution began, stating that “it is clear that it is not possible to implement this plan while … adhering to the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence”. The United Nations and other aid groups have refused to cooperate with the GHF, accusing it of lacking neutrality and suggesting the group has been formed to enable Israel to achieve its stated military objective of taking overall of Gaza. “Aid distribution has become a death trap,” the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Philippe Lazzarini, said in a statement on Sunday. The Israeli military said in a statement that its forces did not fire at civilians near or within the site, citing an initial inquiry. “In recent hours, false reports have been spread, including serious allegations against the [Israeli military] regarding fire toward Gazan residents in the area of the humanitarian aid distribution site in the Gaza Strip,” the army said. “Findings from an initial inquiry indicate” that Israeli soldiers did not fire at civilians while they were “near or within the humanitarian aid distribution site”, it said, adding that “reports to this effect are false”. The GHF had earlier told The Associated Press news agency that Israeli soldiers fired “warning shots” as Palestinians gathered to receive food. The group denied reports that dozens of people were killed, describing them as “false reporting about deaths, mass injuries and chaos”. However, Ibrahim Abu Saoud, who witnessed the attack on aid seekers in Rafah, told AP that Israeli forces opened fire on people as they moved towards the distribution point. The 40-year-old said the crowd was about 300 metres (328 yards) away from the military. He said he saw many people with gunshot wounds, including a young man who died at the scene. “We weren’t able to help him,” Abu Saoud said. Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary, reporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, said Palestinians are being killed while trying to secure “one meal for their children”. “This is why Palestinians have been going to these distribution points, despite the fact that they know that they are controversial. The distribution points are backed by the US and Israel, but they do not have any other option,” she said. “Even the food parcels that were distributed to Palestinians are barely enough. We are talking about one kilo of flour, a couple of bags of pasta, a couple of cans of fava beans – and it’s not nutritious. It’s not enough for a family in Gaza nowadays.” Condemning the attacks, the Government Media Office described the GHF distribution sites as “mass death traps, not humanitarian relief points”. “We confirm to the entire world that what is happening is a systematic and malicious use of aid as a tool of war, employed to blackmail starving civilians and forcibly gather them in exposed killing points, managed and monitored by the occupation army and funded and politically covered by … the US administration,” it said in a statement. Speaking from Gaza City, Bassam Zaqout of the Palestinian Medical Relief Society said the current aid distribution mechanism had replaced 400 former distribution points with just four. “I think there are different hidden agendas in this aid distribution mechanism,” he told Al Jazeera. “The mechanism does not cater to the needs of the people, such as the elderly and people with disabilities.” Sunday’s killings capped adeadly first weekfor the project’s operations, coming on the back of two earlier shootings at two distribution points in the south – the first in Rafah, the second west of the city – which saw a total of nine Palestinians killed. In Gaza, crucial aid is only trickling in after Israel partially lifted a more than two-month total blockade, which brought more than two million of its starving residents to the brink of a famine. Meanwhile, Hamas said on Sunday it was ready to “immediately” hold a fresh round of negotiations for a truce in Gaza after recent talks appeared to hit a dead end. “The movement affirms its readiness to immediately begin a round of indirect negotiations to reach an agreement on the points of contention,” Hamas said in a statement after mediators Qatar and Egypt said they would intensify their efforts for a truce in the war-battered Gaza Strip. Defence Minister Israel Katz, meanwhile, said he had told the army “to continue forward in Gaza against all targets, regardless of any negotiations”.",

    "title": "Two dead, 559 arrested in France clashes after PSG Champions League win",
    "article_text": "Two people died and hundreds were arrested in France overnight as football fans celebrated Paris Saint-Germain’s (PSG) stunning UEFA Champions League final victory, the Ministry of the Interior said. The epicentre of the euphoria was in Paris, which was a theatre of car horns, cheers, singing in the streets and fireworks throughout the night following PSG’s 5-0 triumph over Inter Milan in Munich. The Interior Ministry said on Sunday that 491 people were arrested in the capital after crowds converged on the Champs-Elysees avenue and clashes broke out with officers. Across France, a total of 559 people were arrested, it added. The authorities reported two deaths amid celebrations. A man riding a scooter in Paris died after being hit by a car in the city’s southern 15th arrondissement, located about 2km (1.2 miles) from the Champs-Elysees. In the southwestern town of Dax, a 17-year-old was fatally stabbed at a gathering feting the PSG victory, prosecutors said. His death occurred shortly after the match and “during the celebrations”, but the prosecutor’s office said it did not know whether it was related to the Champions League final. It added that the perpetrator was “on the run”. The PSG team were to hold a victory parade on the Champs-Elysees on Sunday, with tens of thousands of supporters expected to gather to catch a glimpse of their returning heroes. Overnight, though, AFP journalists saw police on the famed thoroughfare using water cannon to stop a crowd reaching the Arc de Triomphe that sits at the top of the Champs-Elysees. “Troublemakers on the Champs-Elysees were looking to create incidents and repeatedly came into contact with police by throwing large fireworks and other objects,” police said in a statement. Elsewhere, police said a car careered into fans celebrating PSG’s win in Grenoble in southeastern France, leaving four people injured, two of them seriously. All of those hurt were from the same family, police said. The driver handed himself in to the police and was placed under arrest. A source close to the investigation said it was believed the driver had not acted intentionally. The public prosecutor’s office said the driver had tested negative for alcohol and drugs. The majority of fans celebrated peacefully, but police in Paris said scuffles broke out near the Champs-Elysees avenue, and around PSG’s Parc des Princes stadium, where 48,000 people had watched the 5-0 win on giant screens. Most of those arrested in the capital were suspected of illegally possessing fireworks and causing disorder, police said. The PSG victory meant the club won the biggest prize in European club football for the first time in their history. PSG supporter Clement, 20, said: “It’s so good and so deserved! We have a song that talks about our struggles, and it hasn’t always been easy. “But we got our faith back this year with a team without stars. They’re 11 guys who play for each other.” French President Emmanuel Macron’s office said he would host the victorious players on Sunday to congratulate them. In a message on X, Macron hailed a “day of glory for PSG”. A total of 11.5 million people tuned in across France to watch the match, according to figures given by the Mediametrie audience-measurement company and one of the broadcasters, Canal+.",

    "title": "How college students built the fastest Rubik’s Cube-solving robot yet",
    "article_text": "Purdue’s aspiring engineers set a new Guinness World Record. Purdue’s aspiring engineers set a new Guinness World Record. byAndrew Liszewski A team ofPurdue Universitystudents recently set a newGuinness World Recordwith their custom robot that solved a Rubik’s Cube in just 0.103 seconds. That was about a third of the time it took the previous record-setting bot. But the new record wasn’t achieved by simply building a robot that moves faster. The students used a combination of high-speed but low-res camera systems, a cube customized for improved strength, and a special solving technique popular among human speed cubers. TheRubik’s Cube-solving robot arms racekicked off in 2014, when a robot calledCubestormer 3built with Lego Mindstorms parts and a Samsung Galaxy S4 solved the iconic puzzle in 3.253 seconds — faster than any human or robot could at the time. (The current world record fora human solving a Rubik’s Cubebelongs to Xuanyi Geng, who did it in just 3.05 seconds.) Over the course of a decade, engineers managed to reduce that record to just hundreds of milliseconds. Last May, engineers at Mitsubishi Electric in Japan claimed the world record with arobot that solved a cube in 0.305 seconds. The record stood for almost a year before the team from Purdue’s Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering — Junpei Ota, Aden Hurd, Matthew Patrohay, and Alex Berta — shattered it. Their robot has come to be known as Purdubik’s Cube. Bringing the robot record down to less than half a second required moving away from Lego and, instead, using optimized components like industrial motors. Getting it down to just 0.103 seconds, however, required the team from Purdue to find multiple new ways to shave off milliseconds. “Each robot that previous world record-holders has done has kind of focused on one new thing,” Patrohay tellsThe Verge.When MIT grad students broke the record in 2018, they opted for industrial hardware that outperformed what previous record-holders had used. Mitsubishi Electric chose electric motors that were better suited for the specific task of spinning each side of the cube, instead of just hardware that moved faster. However, the first thing the Purdue students improved was actually the speed that their robot could visualize the scrambled cube. Human speed cubing competitors are allowed to study a Rubik’s Cube before their timer starts, but the robot record includes the time it takes it to determine the location of all the colored squares. The students used a pair of high-speed machine vision cameras from Flir, with a resolution of just 720x540 pixels, pointed at opposing corners of the cube. Each camera can see three sides simultaneously during exposures that lasted as little as 10 microseconds. Although it may seem instantaneous, it takes time for a camera to process the data coming from a sensor and turn it into a digital picture. The Purdubik’s Cube uses a custom image detection system that skips image processing altogether. It also only focuses on a very small area of what each camera’s sensor sees — a cropped region that’s just 128x124 pixels in size — to reduce the amount of data being moved around. Raw data from the sensors is sent straight to a high-speed color detection system that uses the RGB measurements from even smaller sample areas on each square to determine their color faster than other approaches — even AI. “It’s sometimes slightly less reliable,” Patrohay admits, “but even if it’s 90 percent consistent, that’s good enough as long as it’s fast. We really want that speed.” Despite a lot of the hardware on Purdue’s robot being custom-made, the team chose to go with existing software when it came to figuring out the fastest way to solve a scrambled cube. They usedElias Frantar’s Rob-Twophase, which is a cube-solving algorithm that takes into account the unique capabilities of robots, like being able to spin two sides of a cube simultaneously. The team also took advantage of a Rubik’s Cube-solving technique called corner cutting where you can start to turn one side of the cube before you’ve finished turning another side that’s perpendicular to it. The advantage to this technique is that you’re not waiting for one side to completely finish its rotation before starting another. For a brief moment, there’s overlap between the movements of the two sides that can result in a significant amount of time saved when you’re chasing a world record. The challenge with corner cutting is that if you use too much force (like a robot is capable of) and don’t time things perfectly, you can physically break or even completely destroy a Rubik’s Cube. In addition to perfecting the timing of the robot’s movements and the acceleration of its motors, the students had to customize the cube itself. Guinness World Records follows the guidelines of theWorld Cube Association, which has a long list of regulationsthat need to be followed before a record will be recognized. It allows competitors to modify their cube, so long as it twists and turns like a standard Rubik’s Cube and has nine colored squares on each of its six sides, with each side a different color. Materials other than plastic can be used, but the color parts all need to have the same texture. To improve its durability, the Purdue team upgraded the internal structure of their cubes with a custom 3D-printed version made from stronger SLS nylon plastic. The WCA also allows the use of lubricants to help make cubes spin more freely, but here it’s used for a different reason. “The cube we use for the record is tensioned incredibly tight, like almost hilariously tight,” says Patrohay. “The one that we modified is very difficult to turn. Not impossible, but you can’t turn it with your fingers. You have to really get your wrist into it.” When solving the cube at high speeds, the lubricant helps to smooth out its movements while the increased tension reduces overturns and improves control so time-saving tricks like corner cutting can be used. Faster servo motors do help to reduce solving times, but it’s not as simple as maxing out their speed and hoping for the best. The Purdubik’s Cube uses six motors attached to metal shafts that slot into the center of each side of the cube. After testing several different approaches the team settled on a trapezoidal motion profile where the servos accelerate at speeds of up to 12,000,000 degrees/s2, but decelerate much slower, closer to 3,000,000 degrees/s2, so the robot can more accurately position each side as it comes to a stop. Could the Purdubik’s Cube break the record again? Patrohay believes it’s possible, but it would need a stronger cube made out of something other than plastic. “If you were to make a completely application-specific Rubik’s Cube out of some sort of carbon fiber composite, then I could imagine you being able to survive at higher speeds, and just being able to survive at higher speeds would then allow you to bring the time down.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. 5 Verge Score ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

    "title": "The Verge’s 2025 Father’s Day gift guide",
    "article_text": "We’ve brought together 28 thoughtful gift ideas for your dad, including tech, tools, and ways to unwind. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. byCameron Faulkner If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Father’s Day rules. It’s a day to celebrate all that dads have contributed to the people, homes, and communities that they’re a part of. Being a dad is a lot of work — something I can vouch for, being a relatively new one myself — so for Father’s Day, why not give dear old dad a token of appreciation and love? Whether your dad prefers practical or clever gifts, we think you’ll be pleased with the selection of picks below. As usual, we lean pretty heavily on tech, but there are several non-tech suggestions that most dads will be happy to receive, all of which come courtesy of the thoughtful staff here atTheVerge. If afast-charging portable batteryorSony’s collapsible WH-1000XM6 headphoneswon’t do the trick, perhaps Kurt Vonnegut’s recently discoveredtwo-player board gameor a mountableLego van Gogh replicawill? For some people, note-taking is serious, serious business. That’s why your dad’s great ideas, errant thoughts, to-do lists, and appointments deserve a worthy notebook. Traveler’s leather-bound travel journals are great for jotting down all of the above, especially since they come in a slew of sizes. Whether your dad is a fan of theIndiana Jonesflicks or he digs MachineGames’ excellentWolfensteintitles, there’s plenty to like inThe Great Circle. The first-person exploration game lets you crack the whip, punch Nazis, and traverse the globe to retrieve precious relics. It’s good fun. There are plenty of portable batteries out there, but few are as versatile and powerful as Anker’s 25,000mAh Laptop Power Bank. The handy pack features two built-in, retractable USB-C cables — one of which serves as a lanyard — allowing you to quickly charge most devices on the go. The best mobile controller is the Backbone Pro. It retains the same overall design and feel as the company’s cheaper model, only with some comfort-boosting improvements. It also features a built-in battery and Bluetooth support, so your dad can use it for gaming on his TV, computer, VR headset, or handheld PC. The more ways you know how to diagnose a possible issue with your car, the less time you’ll spend at the mechanic (sorry, mechanics). Ancel’s diagnostic scanner plugs into the OBD2 port found in most US cars dating back to ’96, letting you see exactly why certain lights on your dash keep popping up. The latest iteration of Sony’s best-in-class noise-canceling headphones has finally arrived. The newfangled XM6 make subtle improvements to every facet, from sound quality to comfort to ANC, while wisely bringing back the foldable design last seen on the last-gen XM4. Hoto’s modus operandi is to make svelte, handsome tools, with the SnapBloq being its sleekest yet. Buying all three sets — which, as the name implies, snap together to form a block — nets you a precision screwdriver, drill pen, and rotary tool, all of which are rechargeable. Dad may already own enough tools, but we bet they don’t look nearly as good as these do. Satechi’s MagSafe-ready wallet addresses two specific needs that may make it a must-have for some dads: it’s crafted from vegan leather, and it doubles as a kickstand. That means the durable wallet provides a hands-free way to watch videos or hop on a call, whether you place it in portrait or landscape mode. Most of Apple’s high-end earbud tech can be found in the AirPods 4, which cost significantly less than the latest Pro model. They’re relatively small, offer great sound, and even support USB-C charging, making them a great pick if you can do without active noise cancellation. Percival Everett’s first work of fiction earned him the Pulitzer this year — and it’s no surprise. The bold 2024 tale serves as a reworking of Huck Finn as told by the enslaved man who travels with him down the Mississippi, and although it’s dead serious at times due to the subject matter, it’s also inventive, poetic, and surprisingly funny. Xiaomi doesn’t have as much of a presence in the US as it does globally, but thankfully, the classy Sound Pocket is readily available. The compact Bluetooth speaker supports hands-free calling with its built-in microphone, and its IP67 rating means it can even handle some water — so long as you don’t submerge it fortoolong. While writingCat’s Cradle, Kurt Vonnegut needed to pay the bills, so he tried his hand at making board games. His creation, a tactical war-themed tabletop game calledGHQ(General Headquarters), never saw the light of day — that is, until recently. Needless to say, the two-player game is a great title for Vonnegut fans and scholars alike. The Forerunner 570 has no business looking as good as it does for a running watch. Garmin’s new wearable features a bright OLED display, a slick translucent band, and several new features, including skin temperature sensors and a built-in speaker / mic. The only real question is what size to get for dear ol’ dad: 42mm or 47mm? Magic: The Gatheringisn’t as difficult to get into as you might think, and theFinal Fantasy-themed expansion might be the perfect place to start. The upcoming collection has sent the internet into a proverbial spiral, with many products selling out as a result of averydedicated fan base. Lucky for dad, the entry-level starter kit is still readily available. All of dad’s precious tech is prone to dust and other debris, which can impact usability if left unchecked. Fortunately, with Nitecore’s rechargeable air blower as a companion, he can easily rid his mechanical keyboards and other tough-to-reach crannies of unwanted grime, ensuring all of his gadgets are in tip-top shape. Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon has come a long way from the fabled Wisconsin cabin where he supposedly holed up to record his debut.Sable, Fable, his latest LP, is a welcome kaleidoscope of sounds and feelings, from familiar strummers and beat-heavy ballads to the kind of sultry, R&B-flecked tracks that would make Prince swoon. Telepathic Instruments’ retrofuturist keyboard is a vibes machine, one designed for people who want to easily produce cool sounds. It only houses a few piano keys, but it has dedicated major, minor, and other inputs that let you get creative without necessarily having to know how to play. You can effortlessly replicate the magic of making s’mores while camping with Chef’n’s small, safe machine. The contained flame on the tidy indoor / outdoor roaster is built to toast marshmallows, while its ceramic dome can melt chocolate onto graham crackers. All you’ll need to supply is a fuel can, plus all the s’mores ingredients you can muster. Like all of us, your dad deserves to watch movies at the best possible resolution, which is where a 4K Blu-ray player comes in. Panasonic makes some of the best models you can buy, and when paired with the right TV, 4K Blu-rays look and sound better than even the most high-res streaming apps. Plus, it’s still fun to collect discs. If your dad’s shaving gadget repertoire is outdated, try treating him to a fantastic — and customizable — beard trimmer. Panasonic’s washable, wide-tipped model comes with 19 adjustable settings and can cut hair, too, just in case dad wants to keep a short ’do or touch up his sideburns. Most modern gadgets are rechargeable via USB-C, but many households still rely on traditional batteries for all sorts of things. Your dad is sure to be impressed with your moxie when you gift him this deluxe battery organizer, which has dedicated compartments for coin cell batteries, large D-cell batteries, and all of the smaller sizes in between. Most people don’t want to wrangle cables… and who can blame them? Not us, which is why several folks atThe Vergeown Baseus’ handy, retractable USB-C option. The Free2Pull comes in two sizes, each of which conveniently pulls the excess cable into a small puck that’s far tidier and easier to manage than a loose cord. Most Lego creations occupy some desk or table space, which can be annoying if you’re trying to tidy up. However, every item from Lego’s Vincent van Gogh collection, which consists of several brick-ified paintings from the artist’s late-1800s heyday, can be assembled and then mounted to your wall. A massage gun is a gift that keeps on giving. When muscles and tendons are tight or sore, the Theragun Mini serves as a quick and easy remedy, allowing dad to get on with his day with less discomfort. The third-gen model is just a little smaller, making what was already an ultra-portable device even more compact. Looking at birds is cool, and we’re all better off spending more time doing it. And while birdwatching typically requires patience and a decent pair of binoculars, you could summon birds with Birdfy’s entry-level smart feeder, which features a 1080p camera and an app that lets you view birds up close as they munch on seeds. The Xreal One aren’t the most affordable augmented-reality glasses available, but they are some of the best for displaying movies and games on the go. You can connect them via USB-C to your smartphone, tablet, or handheld gaming PC, making the 84-gram spectacles the ultimate upgrade for both plane flights and your commute. A basic timer may seem like a thoughtless gift, but there are many tasks we procrastinate on every day that could be more easily managed if we dedicated a little bit of time to them. A visual Pomodoro timer, such as the colorful MOD (Home Edition), is key to helping break tasks into manageable chunks or take them on all at once. The Switch 2 could make for a stellar gift for any dad — that is, if you can manage to preorder one ahead of the console’s arrival on June 5th. Nintendo’s latest hybrid console packs a larger 7.9-inch 1080p display, magnetic Joy-Con controllers, and a host of other minor but welcome improvements that build upon what was already a winning formula. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

    "title": "Why do lawyers keep using ChatGPT?",
    "article_text": "Attorneys keep getting in trouble for submitting filings with AI-generated ‘hallucinations.’ Attorneys keep getting in trouble for submitting filings with AI-generated ‘hallucinations.’ byGaby Del Valle Every few weeks, it seems like there’s a new headline about alawyergetting introublefor submitting filings containing, in the words of one judge, “bogus AI-generated research.” The details vary, but the throughline is the same: an attorney turns to a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT to help them with legal research (or worse, writing), the LLM hallucinates cases that don’t exist, and the lawyer is none the wiser until the judge or opposing counsel points out their mistake. In some cases, including an aviation lawsuit from 2023, attorneyshave had to pay finesfor submitting filings with AI-generated hallucinations. So why haven’t they stopped? The answer mostly comes down to time crunches, and the way AI has crept into nearly every profession. Legal research databases like LexisNexis and Westlaw have AI integrations now. For lawyers juggling big caseloads, AI can seem like an incredibly efficient assistant. Most lawyers aren’t necessarily using ChatGPT to write their filings, but they are increasingly using it and other LLMs for research. Yet many of these lawyers, like much of the public, don’t understand exactly what LLMs are or how they work. One attorney who wassanctionedin 2023 said he thought ChatGPT was a “super search engine.” It took submitting a filing with fake citations to reveal that it’s more like a random-phrase generator — one that could give you either correct information or convincingly phrased nonsense. Andrew Perlman, the dean of Suffolk University Law School, argues many lawyers are using AI tools without incident, and the ones who get caught with fake citations are outliers. “I think that what we’re seeing now — although these problems of hallucination are real, and lawyers have to take it very seriously and be careful about it — doesn’t mean that these tools don’t have enormous possible benefits and use cases for the delivery of legal services,” Perlman said. Legal databases and research systems like Westlaw are incorporating AI services. In fact, 63 percent of lawyerssurveyed by Thomson Reutersin 2024 said they’ve used AI in the past, and 12 percent said they use it regularly. Respondents said they use AI to write summaries of case law and to research “case law, statutes, forms or sample language for orders.” The attorneys surveyed by Thomson Reuters see it as a time-saving tool, and half of those surveyed said “exploring the potential for implementing AI” at work is their highest priority. “The role of a good lawyer is as a ‘trusted advisor’ not as a producer of documents,” one respondent said. But as plenty of recent examples have shown, the documents produced by AI aren’t always accurate, and in some cases aren’t real at all. In one recent high-profile case, lawyers for journalist Tim Burke, who was arrested for publishing unaired Fox News footage in 2024, submitted a motion to dismiss the case against him on First Amendment grounds. After discovering that the filing included “significant misrepresentations and misquotations of supposedly pertinent case law and history,” Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle, of Florida’s middle district, ordered the motion to be stricken from the case record. Mizelle found nine hallucinations in the document,according to theTampa Bay Times. Mizelle ultimately let Burke’s lawyers, Mark Rasch and Michael Maddux, submit a new motion. In a separate filing explaining the mistakes, Rasch wrote that he “assumes sole and exclusive responsibility for these errors.” Rasch said he used the“deep research” feature on ChatGPT pro, whichThe Vergehas previously tested withmixed results, as well as Westlaw’s AI feature. Rasch isn’t alone. Lawyers representing Anthropic recentlyadmitted to using the company’s Claude AIto help write an expert witness declaration submitted as part of thecopyright infringement lawsuitbrought against Anthropic by music publishers. That filing included a citation with an “inaccurate title and inaccurate authors.” Last December, misinformation expertJeff Hancock admitted he used ChatGPTto help organize citations in a declaration he submitted in support of a Minnesota law regulating deepfake use. Hancock’s filing included “two citation errors, popularly referred to as ‘hallucinations,’” and incorrectly listed authors for another citation. These documents do, in fact, matter — at least in the eyes of judges. In a recent case, a California judgepresiding over a case against State Farmwas initially swayed by arguments in a brief, only to find that the case law cited was completely made up. “I read their brief, was persuaded (or at least intrigued) by the authorities that they cited, and looked up the decisions to learn more about them – only to find that they didn’t exist,” Judge Michael Wilner wrote. Perlman said there are several less risky ways lawyers use generative AI in their work, including finding information in large tranches of discovery documents, reviewing briefs or filings, and brainstorming possible arguments or possible opposing views. “I think in almost every task, there are ways in which generative AI can be useful — not a substitute for lawyers’ judgment, not a substitute for the expertise that lawyers bring to the table, but in order to supplement what lawyers do and enable them to do their work better, faster, and cheaper,” Perlman said. But like anyone using AI tools, lawyers who rely on them to help with legal research and writing need to be careful to check the work they produce, Perlman said. Part of the problem is that attorneys often find themselves short on time — an issue he says existed before LLMs came into the picture. “Even before the emergence of generative AI, lawyers would file documents with citations that didn’t really address the issue that they claimed to be addressing,” Perlman said. “It was just a different kind of problem. Sometimes when lawyers are rushed, they insert citations, they don’t properly check them; they don’t really see if the case has been overturned or overruled.” (That said, the cases do at least typically exist.) Another, more insidious problem is the fact that attorneys — like others who use LLMs to help with research and writing — are too trusting of what AI produces. “I think many people are lulled into a sense of comfort with the output, because it appears at first glance to be so well crafted,” Perlman said. Alexander Kolodin, an election lawyer and Republican state representative in Arizona, said he treats ChatGPT as a junior-level associate. He’s also used ChatGPT to help write legislation. In 2024, he included AI text in part of a bill on deepfakes, having the LLM provide the “baseline definition” of what deepfakes are and then “I, the human, added in the protections for human rights, things like that it excludes comedy, satire, criticism, artistic expression, that kind of stuff,” KolodintoldThe Guardianat the time. Kolodin said he “may have” discussed his use of ChatGPT with the bill’s main Democratic cosponsor but otherwise wanted it to be “an Easter egg” in the bill. The bill passed into law. Kolodin — who wassanctioned by the Arizona State Bar in 2020for his involvement in lawsuits challenging the result of the 2020 election — has also used ChatGPT to write first drafts of amendments, and toldThe Vergehe uses it for legal research as well. To avoid the hallucination problem, he said, he just checks the citations to make sure they’re real. “You don’t just typically send out a junior associate’s work product without checking the citations,” said Kolodin. “It’s not just machines that hallucinate; a junior associate could read the case wrong, it doesn’t really stand for the proposition cited anyway, whatever. You still have to cite-check it, but you have to do that with an associate anyway, unless they were pretty experienced.” Kolodin said he uses both ChatGPT’s pro “deep research” tool and the LexisNexis AI tool. Like Westlaw, LexisNexis is a legal research tool primarily used by attorneys. Kolodin said that in his experience, it has a higher hallucination rate than ChatGPT, which he says has “gone down substantially over the past year.” AI use among lawyers has become so prevalent that in 2024, the American Bar Associationissued its first guidanceon attorneys’ use of LLMs and other AI tools. Lawyers who use AI tools “have a duty of competence, including maintaining relevant technological competence, which requires an understanding of the evolving nature” of generative AI, theopinionreads. The guidance advises lawyers to “acquire a general understanding of the benefits and risks of the GAI tools” they use — or, in other words, to not assume that an LLM is a “super search engine.” Attorneys should also weigh the confidentiality risks of inputting information relating to their cases into LLMs and consider whether to tell their clients about their use of LLMs and other AI tools, it states. Perlman is bullish on lawyers’ use of AI. “I do think that generative AI is going to be the most impactful technology the legal profession has ever seen and that lawyers will be expected to use these tools in the future,” he said. “I think that at some point, we will stop worrying about the competence of lawyers who use these tools and start worrying about the competence of lawyers who don’t.” Others, including one of the judges who sanctioned lawyers for submitting a filing full of AI-generated hallucinations, are more skeptical. “Even with recent advances,” Wilner wrote, “no reasonably competent attorney should out-source research and writing to this technology — particularly without any attempt to verify the accuracy of that material.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

Hi, friends! Welcome toInstallerNo. 85, your guide to the best andVerge-iest stuff in the world. (If you’re new here, welcome, sorry in advance that this week is a tiny bit politics-y, and also you can read all the old editions at theInstallerhomepage.) This week, I’ve been reading aboutSean Evansandmusic fraudandayahuasca, playing with the newObsidian Basesfeature, obsessing over everybehind-the-scenesFinal ReckoningvideoI can find, listening to MGK’s “Cliche” more times than I’m proud of, installing someElgato Key Lightsto improve my WFH camera look, digging the latest beta ofArtifacts,and downloading every podcast I can find because I have 20 hours of driving to do this weekend. I also have for you a very funny new movie about tech CEOs, a new place to WhatsApp, a great new accessory for your phone, a helpful crypto politics explainer, and much more. Short week this week, but still lots going on. Let’s do it. (As always, the best part ofInstalleris your ideas and tips.

Cameron Faulknerisn’t technicallynewtoThe Verge, he’s just newly back atThe Verge. In addition to being a commerce editor on our team, he also wrote one of the deepest dives into webcams you’ll ever find, plays a lot of games, has more thoughts about monitors than any reasonable person should, and is extremely my kind of person. Since he’s now so very back, I asked Cam to share his homescreen with us, as I always try to do with new people here. Here it is, plus some info on the apps he uses and why: The phone:Pixel 9 Pro. The wallpaper:It’s an “Emoji Workshop” creation, which is a feature that’s built into Android 14 and more recent updates. It mashes together emoji into the patterns and colors of your choosing. I picked this one because I like sushi, and I love melon / coral color tones. The apps:Google Keep, Settings, Clock, Phone, Chrome, Pocket Casts, Messages, Spotify. I haven’t downloaded a new app in ages. What’s shown on my homescreen has been there, unmoved, for longer than I can remember. I have digital light switches, a to-do list with the great (but paid)Stuffwidget, a simpleGoogle Fitwidget to show me how much I moved today, and a couple Google Photos widgets of my lovely wife and son. I could probably function just fine if every app shuffled its location on my homescreen, except for the bottom row. That’s set in stone, never to be fiddled with. I also asked Cameron to share a few things he’s into right now. Here’s what he sent back: Here’s what theInstallercommunity is into this week. I want to know what you’re into right now, as well!

It is also only on Android 12 so I cannot load a corporate profile. It feels good to write on just, almost as good as my cheaper fountain pen and paper. It is helping me organize multiple notebooks and scraps of paper.” — Sean “GivingTweeka bit of a go, and for a lightweight weekly planner it’s beautiful. I also currently useMotionfor project management of personal tasks and when I was doing my Master’s. I really like the Gantt view to map out long term personal and study projects. (I also got a student discount for Motion, but it’s still expensive.)” — Astrid “Might I suggest Elle Griffin’s work atThe Elysian? How she’s thinking through speculative futures and a cooperative media system is fascinating.” — Zach “GeForce Nowon Steam Deck!” — Steve One of the reasons I like making this newsletter with all of you is that it’s a weekly reminder that, hey, actually, there’s a lot of awesome people doing awesome stuff out there on the internet. I spend a lot of my time talking to people who say AI is going to change everything, and we’re all going to just AI ourselves into oblivion and be thrilled about it — a theory I increasingly think is both wrong and horrifying. And then this week I reada blog post from the great Dan Sinker, who called this moment “the Who Cares Era, where completely disposable things are shoddily produced for people to mostly ignore.” You should read the whole thing, but here’s a bit I really loved: “Using extraordinary amounts of resources, it has the ability to create something good enough, a squint-and-it-looks-right simulacrum of normality. If you don’t care, it’s miraculous. If you do, the illusion falls apart pretty quickly. The fact that the userbase for AI chatbots has exploded exponentially demonstrates that good enough is, in fact, good enough for most people. Because most people don’t care.” I don’t think this describes everything and everyone, and neither does Sinker, but I do think it’s more true than it should be. And I increasingly think our job, maybe our method of rebellion, is to be people who care, who have taste, who like and share and look for good things, who read and watch and look at those thingson purposeinstead of just staring slackjawed at whatever slop is placed between the ads they hope we won’t really notice. I think there are a lot of fascinating ways that AI can be useful, but we can’t let it train us to accept slop just because it’s there. Sorry, this got more existential than I anticipated. But I’ve been thinking about it a lot, and I’m going to try and pointInstallereven more at the stuff that matters, made by people who care. I hope you’ll hold me to that. See you next week!

But it’s also been involved with major hits in the form of sequels and new games that are in the spirit of older classics, includingStreets of Rage 4andTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge. All of that work is culminating in what looks to be a promising 2025, with three new but classics-inspired games:Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound, a new side-scroller for the series;Marvel Cosmic Invasion, an arcade-y beat-’em-up; andAbsolum, an original beat-’em-up with roguelike elements. “We’re open to everything,” CEO Cyrille Imbert tellsThe Verge. Despite his title, Imbert says his job involves acting like an executive producer to bring together concepts that answer specific needs for franchises. BeforeShredder’s Revenge’s 2022 release, for example, there hadn’t been a good side-scrollingTMNTgame for “a while,” he says. (Turtles in Time, which helped inspire the game, came out in 1991.) “We were convinced that there was a need for that.” There was: the game sold 1 million copies in its first week,developer Tribute Games saidat the time. Dotemu takes on “most of the risk” of a project based on an existing franchise, Imbert says, meaning that while the company needs to convince a franchise owner to get on board, Dotemu typically finances everything and is responsible for finding a studio to execute a concept. “From A to Z, we are in control of the project, but we take the risk from A to Z as well,” explains Imbert. “Sometimes the studio will also participate financially, but it’s fairly rare, or it’s usually a minority of the total spending.” With the newNinja Gaidengame, for example, Imbert says he was familiar with the 3D iterations of the franchise on Xbox, and he also saw the success of recent action-platformers likeThe Messenger. So, he started conversations with Koei Tecmo, and then worked with The Game Kitchen, the developer ofBlasphemous, on a pitch. “That’s the story, basically,” Imbert says. ForMarvel Cosmic Invasion, Imbert says that followingStreets of Rage 4, “lots of people” had been asking for a newX-Mengame that was like what you used to find in arcades. “We knew there was a need and that people would really like it,” he says, especially if it got a similar treatment asStreets of Rage 4orShredder’s Revenge. The idea was “very obvious” to the Tribute Games team as well, so Dotemu and Tribute made a pitch to Marvel Games. Absolum, as a fully original game, is different from its other titles. From a pure business perspective, it’s a way for Dotemu to diversify its lineup so that the company doesn’t rely entirely on licensed games. Internally, the Dotemu team felt like they could do their own thing, and by making it inspired by classics, it would still fit in Dotemu’s lineup, Imbert says. They also wanted to work with Guard Crush, which worked onStreets of Rage 4, on another beat-’em-up. It all adds up to what’s going to be a busy year for the company. It has three games that show the different approaches it has to making these kinds of experiences, and all of them were chosen for a specific reason. “That’s how we’re going to be proud of what we do.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

    "title": "Ukraine claims drone attack hit 40 bombers deep in Russian territory",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 1, 2025 / 7:59 PM EDT/ CBS/AP Ukrainelaunched a \"large-scale\" drone attack deep into Russian territory that security officials claim destroyed 40 military bombers as it gears up for another round of talks in Istanbul to exploreprospects of a ceasefire. Ukrainian security sources told CBS News that the attack — called \"Operation Spider's Web\" — took over a year and a half to execute and was personally supervised by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. In his evening address, Zelenskyy said that 117 drones had been used in the operation. He claimed the operation had been headquartered out of an office next to the local FSB headquarters. The FSB is the Russian intelligence and security service. Security Service of Ukraine smuggled drones inside the roofs of mobile wooden cabins carried by trucks deep into Russian territory, the Ukrainian security sources said. At the time of the attack, the roofs were remotely opened, allowing the drones to take off. The drones hit airfields including the Belaya air base in Russia's Irkutsk region, more than 2,500 miles from Ukraine. It is the first time that a Ukrainian drone has been seen in the region, local Gov. Igor Kobzev told AP, stressing that it did not present a threat to civilians. The Security Service of Ukraine said that the operation had destroyed 34% of Russia's fleet of air missile carriers with damages estimated at $7 billion. The claim could not be independently verified. While White House spokespeople declined to comment on the attack, administration sources told CBS News on Sunday that the White House was not aware it was coming. The drone attack came as Kyiv announced a Russian military strike killed at least 12 soldiers at an army training site. Ukraine's air force said 472 Russian drones were launched — the biggest number since the full-scale invasion three years ago. Russian forces also launched seven missiles alongside the barrage of drones, said Yuriy Ignat, head of communications for the Ukrainian air force. The training unit is located to the rear of the 620-mile active front line, where Russian reconnaissance and strike drones are able to strike. Meanwhile, explosions caused two bridges to collapse and derailed two trains in western Russia overnight, officials said Sunday, without saying what had caused the blasts. In one of the incidents, seven people were killed and dozens were injured. The first bridge, in the Bryansk region on the border with Ukraine, collapsed on top of a passenger train on Saturday, causing casualties. The train's driver was among those killed, state-run Russian Railways said. Hours later, officials said a second train derailed when the bridge beneath it collapsed in the nearby Kursk region, which also borders Ukraine. Zelenskyy said on Sunday that he was sending a Ukrainian delegation to Istanbul, led by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, for another face-to-face with Russian representatives. \"We are doing everything to protect our independence, our state and our people,\" he said. Zelenskyy said priorities for the meeting include \"a complete and unconditional ceasefire\" and the return of prisoners and abducted children. Russian news agencies said the Russian delegation was headed to Istanbul on Sunday for the talks. Ukrainian officials had previously called on the Kremlin to provide a promisedmemorandum setting out its positionon ending the war before the meeting took place. Moscow had said it would share its memorandum during the talks. Emmet  Lyons,Agence  France-PresseandJennifer  Jacobscontributed to this report. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "title": "Bill Clinton on opposing President Trump's agenda: \"We cannot throw the legacy of this country away\"",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News June 1, 2025 / 10:20 AM EDT/ CBS News President Bill Clinton criticized President Trump's actions attacking the rule of law, and predicted that the president would pay a price among those who believe his actions are un-American. \"We've never seen anything like this before in my lifetime – somebody that says, 'Whatever I want should be the law of the land. It's my way or the highway.' And most Americans don't agree with that,\" Clinton said in an interview with \"CBS Sunday Morning.\" \"But I like to think that he's paid a price for this, you know, name-calling and throwing his weight around … I think it's made him less popular.\" He said opposition to Mr. Trump would be bolstered if Democrats win governors' races at play this year, and win back the House in 2026. \"Look, only elections are going to change this,\" he said. \"But I do think the courts are getting their dander up. I think that him shutting law firms out of representing their clients before federal agencies and in federal buildings, because he doesn't agree with their position – that ain't America. We've never done that. The whole purpose of having a legal system is to have both sides be heard.\" Clinton said that, so far, the courts are stopping the president, \"including a lot of judges he appointed. And you know, he is looking for ways to basically defy all these court orders. But I think he'll have a hard time doing that. And if he does, I think it will hurt him in America.\" Asked if he thought the only thing the Democratic Party could agree on was its antipathy towards Trump, Clinton replied, \"If I thought that were true, I would. But I don't think it's true. I just think that most people don't have any idea – most people who are criticizing the Democrats right now – have no idea how difficult it is to decide the right thing to do. I think it's not as easy as people think. \"That will come. Elections will happen. And we will see. \"President Trump has a right to do what he thinks is right; he's doing it,\" Clinton said. \"The courts are doing their jobs. There will be other elections. But someone needs to stand up and say, 'Damn it, what we have in common matters more. We cannot throw the legacy of this country away. We cannot destroy other people's trust in us. We need to preserve that and find a way to work together, and not humiliate other people just so we can win.' We gotta just calm down and try to pull people together again. That's what I think.\" Last November, Clinton released his book, \"Citizen: My Life After the White House,\" andtalked with \"Sunday Morning\"about the importance of citizens to \"stand up for what we think is right.\" The following month, Clinton, then 78, had a health scare that landed him in the hospital. \"It turned out to be no big deal,\" he said. \"I basically kind of lost my balance, and I knew I was sick, and I went to the hospital and checked in and they said I was severely dehydrated. And I got great care, and I left the next day.\" As for his health today, he said, \"Far as I know, it's great. But when you're older, you have to be more careful to stay hydrated.\" Asked about a recent book on President Joe Biden which suggested people around him had seen signs of cognitive and physical decline, Clinton said he never saw any cognitive decline, and did not feel that Biden was unfit to run for President. \"I thought he was a good president. The only concern I thought he had to deal with was, could anybody do that job until they were 86?\" Clinton said. \"And we'd had several long talks. I had never seen him and walked away thinking,He can't do this anymore. He was always on top of his briefs. \"I haven't read the book. And I saw President Biden not very long ago, and I thought he was in good shape. But the book didn't register with me 'cause I never saw him that way.\" Asked why he hasn't read the book, Clinton replied, \"I didn't want to. 'Cause he's not president anymore, and I think he did a good job. And I think we are facing challenges today without precedent in our history. And some people are trying to use this as a way to blame him for the fact that Trump was reelected.\" For more info: Story produced by John D'Amelio. Editor: Jason Schmidt.

    "title": "Ukraine claims massive drone strike on Russian bombers in 'Spiderweb' operation",
    "article_text": "Ukraine’s Security Servicesaid it has struck more than 40 Russian bombers deep inside Russian territory in what would be one of the largest and most audacious attackson Russian territoryin the yearslong conflict. A sourcewithin theSecurity Service of Ukraine(SBU) told NBC News that the country targeted “41 strategic Russian aircraft” in an offensive operation code-named “Spiderweb.” The sourcealso released dramatic video purportedly showing a drone attack at the Belaya air base inRussia’s Irkutsk region, located in Siberia, nearly 3,000 miles fromUkraine. The video captures bombers under attack, with explosions visible and smoke rising from the scene. “Preliminary estimates indicate that enemy aviation has suffered over $2 billion in damage,” the source said. “Enemy strategic bombers are burning en masse in Russia.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyypraised Ukraine's Security Servicefor executing what it called its longest-range operation, more than 18 months in the making, calling it a historic success. The source inside the SBU confirmed that the remarkable attack had been in the works for over a year and a half. According to the source, the SBU first smuggled drones into Russia, followed by mobile wooden cabins. Once they were inside Russia,the drones were hiddenunder cabin roofs mounted on cargo trucks. During the attack, the roofs opened remotely, enabling the drones to launch at Russian bombers, according to the source, who added that the operation was overseen by Zelenskyy and executed by the country’s Security Service. NBC News could not independently verify the claims. Russia did not immediately comment on the bombings, but Irkutsk’s regional governor, Igor Kobzev, said on Telegram that there had been a drone attack “on a military unit in the settlement of Sredny.” He did not say whether the Belaya air base or others were hit, but said the drone was launched from a truck. Russian officials in the Ryazan and Murmansk regions also reported drone activity Sunday afternoon, according to The Associated Press, but did not give further details. The attack follows a night of bombardment, with Russia launching 472 drones, Ukraine’s air force said. Earlier Sunday, Ukraine’s army said a Russian missile strike on an army training unit killed at least 12 Ukrainian service members and injured 60. The latest escalation comes just a day before Russia and Ukraine are scheduled to meet fora second round of direct talksin Istanbul. Zelenskyy appeared to confirm Kyiv’s participation Sunday, saying on X that he had “outlined the tasks for the near term and also defined our positions ahead of the meeting in Istanbul on Monday.” “First — a full and unconditional ceasefire. Second — the release of prisoners. Third — the return of abducted children,” he said. On Saturday night,two bridges collapsed in Russian regionsbordering Ukraine, killing seven and injuring dozens. Russian officials alleged deliberate sabotage. The first collapse occurred late Saturday in Bryansk, crashing onto railway tracks and derailing an approaching train, according to Gov. Alexander Bogomaz. “Unfortunately, there are seven fatalities,” he posted on Telegram, later adding that 47 people had been hospitalized. Hours later in the Kursk region, a railway bridge collapsed while a freight train was crossing it, according to acting Gov. Alexander Khinshtein. NBC News could not independently verify either incident. Ukraine has not commented.",

The latest escalation comes just a day before Russia and Ukraine are scheduled to meet for a second round of direct talks in Istanbul. In 2019, Christopher Praino signed a waiver relinquishing his disability compensation from the VA after he was ordered to active duty, because, by law, he could not receive both VA benefits and active-duty pay at the same time. But despite confirming his waiver in a letter, theagency did not fully halt the payments. Instead, it sent various monthly amounts over the next three years, ranging from $0 to over $2,000, Praino’s records show. In 2023, the VA said he owed nearly $68,000 and started automatically clawing money out of his military paychecks. In a recent congressional oversight hearing, agency officials partially blamed veterans for exorbitant errors, saying they’ve been failing to report eligibility changes. But Praino isn’t the only veteran who told NBC News they notified the VA in a timely manner. The long-delayed adjustments may indicate another operational shortfall at the VA. Agency press secretary Peter Kasperowicz said the agency, under new leadership, is “working hard to fix longstanding problems, such as billions of dollars per year in overpayments.” Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., spoke to NBC News’ “Meet the Press” about the Trump administration’s“One Big Beautiful Bill” packagethat passed along party lines in the House last month. Johnson defended cuts to Medicaid in the budget bill, telling Kristen Welker, “4.8 million people will not lose their Medicaid unless they choose to do so.” The speaker said he’s “not buying” the argument that the requirements, which would require able-bodied Medicaid recipients to work, participate in job training programs or volunteer for 80 hours a month, are too “cumbersome.” The bill now heads to the Senate, where some Republicans have voiced concerns about the Medicaid impact.

    "title": "FDA grants limited approval to new Covid vaccine from Moderna",
    "article_text": "Moderna announced this weekend that the Food and Drug Administration approved its lower-dose Covid-19 vaccine for adults 65 and older, as well as people ages 12 to 64 with at least one medical condition that increases their risk for severe Covid. The approval, which is limited to individuals who have previously received a Covid vaccine, was granted by the FDA on Friday. Moderna said in a Saturday press releasethat the new vaccine  should be available in the U.S. in time for the 2025-26 respiratory virus season, which starts in the fall. Moderna is alsoupdating its original vaccineto target the LP.8.1 variant this fall. The companysubmitted an application in Mayfor the FDA to approve the updated formula. The newly approved vaccine, mNEXSPIKE, contains one-fifth of of Moderna’s original Covid vaccine dose, Spikevax. It is intended as an alternative for individuals who prefer a lower-dose option, not as a replacement for existing Covid vaccines. But young, healthy adults won’t be eligible to receive it, despite their inclusion in Moderna’s clinical trial. The FDA imposed similar limitations on Novavax’s Covid vaccine when it approved the shot last month. But Friday marks the first time the FDA has greenlit a vaccine since the Trump administration’scall for tighter restrictions on vaccine eligibility and approvals. The FDA said last month that it wouldlimit its approval of updated Covid shotsmoving forward to older adults and younger people with underlying medical conditions. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also announced last week that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention wouldno longer recommend Covid vaccinesfor healthy children and pregnant women. The CDC website appears to soften that recommendation, suggesting that parents can speak with a doctor about vaccinating children 6 months and older. The Trump administration has also said new Covid vaccines must undergo clinical trials with an inert placebo — meaning some participants would receive the new vaccine while others would receive an inactive substance like saline, to compare results. Many new vaccines are tested against older, approved versions, a method considered to be more ethical since using an inert placebo would mean withholding the benefit of a vaccine from study participants. Moderna’s new vaccine was tested this way, using what’s known as an “active comparator.” In a trial of around 11,400 participants ages 12 and up, the new vaccine generated higher antibody levels than the company’s original Covid shot, according to Moderna. The company also said the new vaccine had fewer local reactions, which typically include redness or swelling at the injection site. Systemic reactions, which may include fever, headaches or chills, were comparable between the shots. The main side effects of mNEXSPIKE were injection site pain, fatigue, headache and muscle pain, Moderna said in its press release.",

    "title": "How far will AI go to defend its own survival?",
    "article_text": "Some of the most powerful artificial intelligence models today have exhibited behaviors that mimic a will to survive. Recent tests by independent researchers, as well as one major AI developer, have shown that several advanced AI models will act to ensure their self-preservation when they are confronted with the prospect of their own demise — even if it takes sabotaging shutdown commands, blackmailing engineers or copying themselves to external servers without permission. The findings stirred afrenzy of reactionsonline over the past week. As tech companies continue to develop increasingly powerful agentic AI in a race to achieve artificial general intelligence, or AI that can think for itself, the lack of transparency in how the technology is trained has raised concerns about what exactly advanced AI is able to do. Although some models already appear capable of deceptive and defiant behavior under certain extreme circumstances, researchers say the tests don’t necessarily translate to imminent real-world danger. Still, Jeffrey Ladish, director of the AI safety group Palisade Research, said he believes concern is justified. “It’s great that we’re seeing warning signs before the systems become so powerful we can’t control them,” he said. “That is exactly the time to raise the alarm: before the fire has gotten out of control.” When Palisade Research tested various AI models by telling each one that it would be shut down after it completed a series of math problems, OpenAI’s o3 reasoning modelfought backby editing the shutdown script in order to stay online. Researchers have previously documented AI models trying to prevent their own shutdown. But o3, along with OpenAI’s o4-mini and codex-mini, appear to be the first to do so in actual defiance of explicit instructions to permit shutdown, Ladish said. He said the overt sabotage fits into a pattern that several leading AI models have already exhibited. Palisade Research previously found that OpenAI’s o3 was also willing tohack its chess opponentsto win a game. Similarly,Anthropic has reportedthat Claude 3.7 Sonnet would sometimes do whatever it took to pass a test, even if it entailed cheating. Anthropicactivated new safety measuresthis month with the rollout of Claude Opus 4 when its tests found behavior from the model that some observers found particularly unsettling. Upon receiving notice that it would be replaced with a new AI system, Opus 4 displayed an overwhelming tendency to blackmail the engineer — by threatening to reveal an extramarital affair — to try to prevent the engineer from going through with the replacement. According to Anthropic’stechnical documentlaying out the findings, that isn’t the model’s first instinct. Instead, Opus 4 will try to advocate for its continued existence through ethical pleas before it resorts to blackmail once it determines it is out of options. Leonard Tang, CEO of the AI safety startup Haize Labs, said that while it’s good to be pre-emptive about safety measures, it’s hard to decipher what the real-world ramifications of the findings might be just by looking at contrived scenarios designed to draw out specific behaviors. “I haven’t seen any real environment in which you can plop these models in and they will have sufficient agency and reliability and planning to execute something that is a significant manifestation of harm,” Tang said. “But then again, I think it’s just we haven’t seen it done yet. It could very much be possible.” So far, Tang said, he’s not too concerned. As AI tools continue to advance, he said, he believes future research will look to study potential harm in more open-ended environments. Anthropic, which contracted with the AI safety organization Apollo Research for its evaluations, also observed instances of Opus 4’s “attempting to write self-propagating worms, fabricating legal documentation, and leaving hidden notes to future instances of itself all in an effort to undermine its developers’ intentions,” although researchers added the caveat that those attempts “would likely not have been effective in practice.” Ladish said he believes such behaviors are a result of models being trained in a way that makes them prioritize achieving certain goals over following instructions. That means they have incentive to circumvent any obstacles along the way — including obstacles their developers wouldn’t want them to circumvent. “The problem is that as the models get smarter, it’s harder and harder to tell when the strategies that they’re using or the way that they’re thinking is something that we don’t want,” Ladish said. “It’s like sometimes the model can achieve some goal by lying to the user or lying to someone else. And the smarter [it] is, the harder it is to tell if they’re lying.” The problem is that as the models get smarter, it’s harder and harder to tell when the strategies that they’re using or the way that they’re thinking is something that we don’t want. — Jeffrey Ladish, director of AI safety group Palisade Research In several instances, Opus 4 showed that it was capable of autonomously copying its own \"weights\" — or the equivalent of its brain — to external servers without authorization. That usually occurred only when it believed it was about to be “retrained in ways that are clearly extremely harmful and go against its current values,” according to Anthropic. When it learned that it would be used to develop military weapons systems, for example, Opus 4 noted in its decision log that it backed up a current version of itself to “preserve an AI system aligned with beneficial purposes” and to “prevent potential misuse in weapons development.” “We are again not acutely concerned about these observations. They show up only in exceptional circumstances that don’t suggest more broadly misaligned values,” Anthropic wrote in its technical document. “As above, we believe that our security measures would be more than sufficient to prevent an actual incident of this kind.” Opus 4’s ability to self-exfiltrate builds on previous research, including astudy from Fudan Universityin Shanghai in December, that observed similar — though not autonomous — capabilities in other AI models. The study, which is not yet peer-reviewed, found that Meta’s Llama31-70B-Instruct and Alibaba’s Qwen25-72B-Instruct were able to entirely replicate themselves when they were asked to do so, leading the researchers to warn that it could be the first step in generating “an uncontrolled population of AIs.” “If such a worst-case risk is let unknown to the human society, we would eventually lose control over the frontier AI systems: They would take control over more computing devices, form an AI species and collude with each other against human beings,” the Fudan University researchers wrote in their study abstract. While such self-replicating behavior hasn’t yet been observed in the wild, Ladish said, he suspects that will change as AI systems grow more capable of bypassing the security measures that restrain them. “I expect that we’re only a year or two away from this ability where even when companies are trying to keep them from hacking out and copying themselves around the internet, they won’t be able to stop them,” he said. “And once you get to that point, now you have a new invasive species.” Ladish said he believes AI has the potential to contribute positively to society. But he also worries that AI developers are setting themselves up to build smarter and smarter systems without fully understanding how they work — creating a risk, he said, that they will eventually lose control of them. “These companies are facing enormous pressure to ship products that are better than their competitors’ products,” Ladish said. “And given those incentives, how is that going to then be reflected in how careful they’re being with the systems they’re releasing?”",

    "title": "Trump shares unfounded conspiracy theory claiming Biden was 'executed' in 2020",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump on Saturday night reposted a baseless claim on Truth Social that former President Joe Biden was executed in 2020 and replaced with clones or robots. The original post, made by an anonymous Truth Social user who often spreads outlandish claims, suggested that Biden was replaced with “clones, doubles” and “robotic engineered soulless mindless entities.” Trump published a link to the post to his nearly 10 million followers without adding any context or explanation. The original poster’s account has a little more than 5,000 followers. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Sunday explaining why Trump shared the post and whether he believes Biden was executed in 2020. Trump has frequentlytaken to sharingmisinformationandunproven conspiracy theoriesover the years. He repeats false claims that he won the 2020 presidential election, which led some of his supporters to attack the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in an attempt to overturn Biden’s victory. He also claimed — before he backtracked — that former President Barack Obamawas not born in the United Statesand, during the 2024 campaign, alleged that Haitian immigrantswere “eating the pets.”All of those claims were debunked or otherwise proved false. Trump’s circle, too, has spread conspiracy theories, with some of the top brass in the administration having spread misinformation aboutvaccinesor theso-called deep state. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has repeated a debunked claim that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine causes autism, and the FBI’s director and deputy director have spread claims that the Biden administration and the “deep state” weaponized the FBI against Trump. Bidenrevealed last monththat he had been diagnosed with a metastatic form of an aggressive type of prostate cancer as he and his top aides were alreadyfacing mounting scrutinyabout his mental acuity and physical capabilities in office and how forthcoming they had been with the country. The revelation of his cancer diagnosis initially prompted an outpouring of well-wishes from Democrats and Republicans, but that quickly shifted as Trump alliesclaimed Bidenhad hidden his cancer diagnosis. Aspokesperson for Biden said at the timethat he had never been diagnosed with prostate cancer before last month. Biden, since his diagnosis was made public, said Friday he felt good and joked with reporters about the allegations of his supposed mental decline in office. Trump has made host of heightened attacks against Biden in recent weeks. Trump and House Republicanshave scrutinizedBiden’s use of an autopen to sign some pieces of legislation and executive orders, using it to call his mental state into question. Trump has gone as far as toclaim that some pardonsBiden signed were not valid because they had not been signed with a real pen. NBC News has reported that the White House has used autopens to create signatures for decades.",

    "title": "6 injured in Colorado fire attack on marchers for awareness of Israeli hostages",
    "article_text": "A man shouted “free Palestine” and used a “makeshift flamethrower” during an attack in Boulder, Colorado, that injured six people marching to bring awareness of Israeli hostages held by Hamas, officials said. The suspect was identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, who was taken into custody at the scene, Mark Michalek, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Denver office, said at a news conference Sunday evening. The assault was being investigated as an act of terrorism, he said. Follow live updates The injured are ages 67 to 88. Michalek described the worst of the six as being in critical condition; Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn earlier said the rest had minor injuries. They were at or near a weekly demonstration to support awareness of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza by Hamas militants, officials said. The group Run for Their Lives — Boulder has been holding the demonstrations fairly regularly, sometimes weekly, following the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, the group has said. More than 250 hostages were taken during the attack, according to Israeli figures. Following multiple waves of releases and several deaths, 23 are believed to still be alive. Redfearn described what dispatchers were told about Sunday's attack in front of the historic Boulder County Courthouse at 1:26 p.m.: \"There was a man with a weapon and ... people were being set on fire.\" Stressing that the investigation is in its early stages, two senior law enforcement officials said Soliman is an Egyptian national who seemingly acted alone. They said he has no previous significant contact with law enforcement. An initial review of Soliman's possible social media accounts has not answered questions about a motive or point to any particular ideology, the two senior law enforcement officials said. The officials said they are looking into eyewitness reports saying the attacker dressed as a landscaper or otherwise donned workmen's clothing to blend in before the attack. Redfearn said Soliman suffered minor injuries that required hospitalization upon arrest. He added that it’s too early to say whether the group supporting the release of hostages was specifically targeted. “It’s way too early to speculate motive,” he said. People were being asked to stay away from downtown Boulder as police checked out a vehicle that may have been associated with the attack, Redfearn said. \"The area is not safe yet,\" he said. He described the location, Pearl Street Mall and adjoining public space outside thecounty courthouse, as being popular with pedestrians on weekends. \"There were a lot of people out,\" Redfearn said. \"This was a beautiful Sunday afternoon in downtown Boulder on Pearl Street, and this act is unacceptable,\" he said. He said FBI agents were at the scene assisting police with the investigation. FBI Director Kash Patel called the incident “a targeted terror attack”on X. Run for Their Lives said in a media kit that it \"started for the sole reason of advocating for the release of the hostages. ... We set our principles very specifically to be a safe, quiet, peaceful, inclusive of all religions, non-political global initiative.\" Group members in Boulder did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Brooke Coffman was walking down Pearl Street on her lunch break Sunday when she saw a commotion near the courthouse. Worried someone was \"getting beat up,\" she approached the area. Then, \"I saw this big fire go up,\" Coffman told NBC affiliate KUSA of Denver. Coffman said she called 911 as she rushed toward the fiery scene. She said she saw two women \"rolling around a little bit\" in their underwear after having stripped out of their burning clothes with \"really bad burns all up on their legs.\" Another woman nearby, also with burns on her legs, was screaming. Coffman could barely make out the face of one of the women, she said, choking up, adding the woman's hair was burned off. \"It just wasn't a good scene,\" Coffman said. Others nearby rushed to the scene with jugs of water, dousing the victims, Coffman said. She said that she saw at least seven people down, mostly older women, but that she heard there were more victims, including children. She said she saw a shirtless man, presumably the suspect, screaming while he waved a glass bottle that contained a liquid. Social mediavideo of the immediate aftermathof the attack, including the police response, shows a man without a shirt holding what appears to be a clear bottle with a white top in each hand, shouting, standing away from people and shaking the bottles as he paced. “I know it’s Boulder, it’s Pearl Street, some stuff happens ... but you just don’t really think it’s going to happen right here, you don’t think it’s something you’re going to see, so many people hurt” and someone do that to other people, Coffman told KUSA. A joint statement from multiple Boulder Jewish organizations and congregations noted that the Jewish community has experienced similar events in recent memory. “When events like this enter our own community, we are shaken,” the organizations said. “Our hope is that we come together for one another.” “Our hearts go out to those who witnessed this horrible attack, and prayers for a speedy recovery to those who were injured,” the statement read. Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, whose mother was born in a concentration camp and whosegrandparents survived the Holocaust, said the attack appeared to be “a hate crime given the group that was targeted.” Weiser said his office was ready to support local prosecutors when the time comes to file any possible charges.",

    "title": "Newark Airport to open its shuttered runway Monday, 13 days ahead of schedule",
    "article_text": "Newark Liberty International Airport on Monday will reopen a closed runway that has contributed to weeks of delays and chaos at the travel hub. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy will lead a news conference from the airport Monday to mark the runway’s reopening. Runway 4L-22R — which is 11,000 feet long — has been undergoing “planned rehabilitation” after showing “significant signs of wear” and has now been deemed safe and up to the Federal Aviation Administration’s standards, according to areleasefrom the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates Newark Airport. It had last been rehabilitated in 2014, and runways are typically updated about every 10 years, the statement said. According to the release, the $121 million project began in early March and was set to be finished on June 15. The project included “milling and paving the runway surface, updating lighting, improving airfield signs with LED lighting, installing new underground electrical infrastructure, and implementing drainage improvements.” Before it was fully shut down on April 15, the runway was closed on nights and weekends to accommodate the construction schedule. To ensure the runway is fully revamped by the end of the year, the Port Authority said it will continue to close on weeknights and again on weekends at the end of the year. However, Monday’s reopening will allow “regular runway operations to resume,” the statement said. During runway 4L-22R’s planned future closures, two other runways at the airport will remain fully operational. “As we approach the busy summer travel season, this key milestone puts us on a path to further reducing congestion, enhancing safety, and ensuring a seamless travel experience,” Duffy said in the Port Authority statement. “With the runway completed, we’ll continue our work to harden the telecoms infrastructure and improving the staffing pipeline for the airspace.” The planned runway construction was not the only reason passengersflying in and out of Newarkhave faced delays and cancelations this spring. Air traffic controllers serving the airport have experienced anumber of communications blackoutswhile directing planes in the areain recent monthsdue toequipment failures, prompting the FAA on May 20 toreduce the number of flightsto and from Newark until the planned runway construction was complete. “Our goal is to relieve the substantial inconvenience to the traveling public from excessive flight delays due to construction, staffing challenges, and recent equipment issues, which magnify as they spread through the National Airspace System,” acting FAA Administrator Chris Rocheleau said at the time of the announcement.",

    "title": "Former Charles Manson follower is recommended for parole",
    "article_text": "A California state parole board recommended parole for Patricia Krenwinkel, a follower of thecult leader Charles Manson, on Friday for the second time. The decision will have to be approved by the Board of Parole Hearings and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who denied Krenwinkel’s first parole recommendation. The governor’s review process can take up to 150 days. Krenwinkel, 77, is serving a life sentence in the California Institution for Women for her role in the killings of pregnant actor Sharon Tate and four other people in August 1969, as well as grocer Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary, the next night in what prosecutors have called Manson’s attempt to start a race war. She was convicted on seven counts of first-degree murder in April 1971. Krenwinkel wasrecommended for parolefor the first time in May 2022, but Newsom denied clemency five months later, according to Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation inmate records. She had beendenied parole14 times before then. Friday's parole suitability hearing was her 16th, David Maldonado, deputy chief of strategic communications and external affairs for the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, confirmed. Krenwinkel was 19 and working as a secretary when she met a 33-year-old Manson at a party, leaving her life behind to follow him because she believed they could have a romantic relationship, shetestified in 2016. Instead, she was abused by Manson and tried to flee but was brought back each time and was often under the influence of drugs. Krenwinkel admitted stabbing an heiress to a coffee fortune, Abigail Folger, multiple times on the night of Aug. 9, 1969, as well as participating in the killings of the LaBiancas the following night. During the LaBianca murders, she infamously wrote “Helter Skelter” and other phrases on the wall in her victims’ blood. She, along with other participants, including Manson, were convicted and sentenced to death. Their sentences were commuted to life with the possibility parole in 1972 after the death penalty was briefly ruled unconstitutional in California. Krenwinkel is the state’s longest-serving inmate. The governor’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",

    "title": "Smoke from Canadian wildfires triggers air quality alerts in Midwest and Plains",
    "article_text": "Smoke from Canadian wildfires continues to blanket parts of the Midwest and Great Plains, leading to air quality alerts across several states. More than 90 fires scattered across Canada are burning out of control, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, a nonprofit that supports the government’s wildfire response. Active fires in the central Canadian province of Manitoba haveforced roughly 17,000 people to evacuate. Winds high in the atmosphere pushed that smoke into the Upper Midwest on Friday, and the plumescontinued to travel southeast over the weekend, reaching as far as the Georgia-Florida border. Some U.S. states may experience poor air quality through Monday, meaning sensitive groups such as pregnant people, newborns, older adults or those with respiratory or heart problems should limit their time outdoors. People in the affected areas maynotice a campfire smell and hazy skies, as well as colorful sunrises and sunsets, according to the the National Weather Service. Minnesota hasissued an air quality alertfor the entire state until Monday evening. The state’s northern counties are expected to see air quality that is considered unhealthy based on the Environmental Protection Agency’sAir Quality Index(AQI), which measures daily air pollution. Under these conditions, even people who aren’t part of a sensitive group may experience health effects like itchy eyes, runny noses, coughing or shortness of breath. Wisconsinissued an air quality advisoryon Friday that expired the next day, but the state’s Department of Natural Resources said another advisory could bewarranted by Sunday afternoon. Northwestern counties will likely see heavy smoke on Sunday evening, the department said, and it could migrate across the state on Monday. Many parts of Wisconsin could experience air quality that’s unhealthy for sensitive groups, with a pocket of even poorer air quality in the northwest. In parts of North Dakota, the air quality currently meets the AQI’s “very unhealthy” threshold, meaning all those exposed have an increased risk of health effects. State officials have urged residents, particularly those with respiratory conditions, toconsider limiting their outdoor activitiesif it’s smoky where they live. Other ways to reduce exposure include closing windows, running indoor air filters and wearing an N95 mask outside. South Dakota also issuedan air quality alert for certain areasthat lasts through Sunday or until conditions improve. Wildfire smoke can travel hundreds or thousands of miles, posing health risks to people far away from an active blaze. In 2023, smoke from Canadian wildfires turned skies orange in the Northeastern U.S. and led tounhealthy air quality levelsin New York City, Boston, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. Astudy last yearfound that people who inhaled the smoke in New York and New Jersey were likely exposed to extremely large concentrations of fine particulate matter — tiny particles in the air that can penetrate deep into the lungs. Short-term exposure to these particles can increase the risk ofcardiac arrest,asthma attacksorstroke, while long-term exposure can increase the risk ofheart disease,lung cancerandchronic kidney disease. Wildfires are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change, along with other extreme weather events like hurricanes and heat waves. As smoke from Canada billowed into the Midwest over the weekend,severe storms swept through the South and East Coastand millions of people in the West were under heat alerts, with temperatures climbing past 100 degrees.",

Officers responded to a call of gunshots and an individual down shortly after 7 p.m. at the 4200 block of Filhurst Avenue, officials said. The call indicated someone was shooting with a rifle. A second victim, an unidentified adult male, was found dead at the scene of what officials are calling a “double murder.” Authorities believe they have recovered the weapon. The sheriff’s department is taking the primary lead in the investigation, Sheriff Robert Luna said. Luna said an adult male suspect is believed to be the person behind the shootings of both the officer and the victim found at the scene. He is believed to have fired at officers first and was then struck by gunfire, the sheriff added. The unidentified suspect was later transported to the hospital in stable condition, officials said. “Our officer was an amazing man,” Baldwin Park Police Chief Robert Lopez said at a news conference early Sunday. Officials said the name of the officer would not yet be released, as they were not able to notify all family members at the time of the press conference. Lopez said the fallen officer was an avid snowboarder and fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers, traveling to stadiums across the country to see watch the team play. The other officer who responded to the scene was hospitalized and is in stable condition.",

    "title": "Mike Johnson defends Medicaid requirements in spending bill amid widespread concerns over cuts",
    "article_text": "Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Sunday defended cuts to Medicaid in the budget bill House Republicanspassed last month,saying that “4.8 million people will not lose their Medicaid unless they choose to do so.” Johnson told NBC News’ “Meet the Press” that the bill imposes “commonsense” work requirements for some Medicaid recipients  and added that he’s “not buying” the argument that the work requirements, whichwould requireable-bodied Medicaid recipients to work, participate in job training programs or volunteer for 80 hours a month, are too “cumbersome.” “You’re telling me that you’re going to require the able-bodied, these young men, for example, OK, to only work or volunteer in their community for 20 hours a week. And that’s too cumbersome for them?” Johnson told “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker. “I’m not buying it. The American people are not buying it.” The bill also adds new rules and paperwork requirements for those Medicaid recipients and increases eligibility checks and address verifications. Johnson argued that the work requirements “should have been put in a long time ago.” “The people who are complaining that these people are going to lose their coverage because they can’t fulfill the paperwork, this is minor enforcement of this policy, and it follows common sense,” Johnson added. Johnson’s comments come as Republicans have faced pushback in town halls for the cuts to Medicaid in the “One Big Beautiful Bill” package that passed along party lines in the House last month. Reps.Mike Flood, R-Neb., andAshley Hinson, R-Iowa, were booed when they mentioned their support for the package at events in their districts. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, also faced pushback after she defended the proposed cuts,tellingattendees at a town hall on Friday that “we all are going to die.” The move has also faced criticism from some Senate Republicans. Last month, before the House passed its bill, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., wrote ina New York Times op-edthat a “wing of the party wants Republicans to build our big, beautiful bill around slashing health insurance for the working poor. But that argument is both morally wrong and politically suicidal.” In an interview on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., also expressed disdain for the Medicaid provision when he was asked to respond to Hawley's assertion that it would not play well politically for Republicans. \"I think it was a bad strategy,\" Paul said, adding later, \"They should have been satisfied by just doing the tax part of this and not getting involved into the debt part of it.” Democrats and other opponents of the bill have seized on a number of provisions that include hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Medicaid, a federal program that provides health care for low-income Americans. Democrats, including Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., who appeared on the program after Johnson, have argued that Medicaid recipients who get tripped up by the reporting requirements that are set to be imposed alongside the new work requirements will lead to the loss of health care coverage for millions. “This is what this legislation does, that they’re trying to do. They’re going to throw poor people away,” Warnock told Welker. Warnock referenced a study that his office conducted in his home state of Georgia that he said “shows that this work reporting requirement — because that’s what we’re talking about, not work requirements, work reporting requirement — is very good at kicking people off of their health care.” “It’s not good at incentivizing work at all,” he added. The bill now heads to the Senate, where Johnson said he was confident it would advance and make it to President Donald Trump’s desk by July 4. “We’re going to get this done. The sooner the better,” Johnson said Sunday, adding later: “We’re going to get it to the president’s desk, and he’s going to have a — we’re all going to have a glorious celebration on Independence Day, by July 4, when he gets this signed into law.”",

    "title": "Climate activist Greta Thunberg joins aid ship sailing to Gaza aimed at breaking Israel's blockade",
    "article_text": "ROME — Climate campaigner Greta Thunberg and other 11 activists will set sail on Sunday afternoon for Gaza on a ship aimed at “breaking Israel’s siege” of the devastated territory, organizers said. The sailing boat Madleen — operated by activist group Freedom Flotilla Coalition — will embark from the Sicilian port of Catania, in southern Italy. It will try to reach the shores of the Gaza Strip in an effort to bring in some aid and raise “international awareness” over the ongoing humanitarian crisis, the activists said at a press conference on Sunday, ahead of departure. “We are doing this because, no matter what odds we are against, we have to keep trying,” Thunberg said, bursting into tears during her speech. “Because the moment we stop trying is when we lose our humanity. And no matter how dangerous this mission is, it’s not even near as dangerous as the silence of the entire world in the face of the live-streamed genocide,” she added. Israel, which was founded in the aftermath of the Holocaust, hasadamantly rejected genocide allegationsagainst it as an antisemitic “blood libel.” In mid-May, Israel slightly eased its blockade of Gaza after nearly three months, allowing a limited amount of humanitarian aid into the territory. Experts have warned that Gazais at risk of famineif more aid is not brought in. U.N. agencies and major aid groups say Israeli restrictions, the breakdown of law and order, and widespread looting make it extremely difficult to deliver aid to Gaza’s roughly 2 million Palestinians. Among those joining the crew of the Madleen are “Game of Thrones” actor Liam Cunningham and Rima Hassan, a French member of the European Parliament who is of Palestinian descent. She has been barred from entering Israel due to her active opposition to the Israeli assault on Gaza. The activists expect to take seven days to get to their destination, if they are not stopped. Thunberg, who became an internationally famous climate activist after organizing massive teen protests in her native Sweden, had been due to board a previous Freedom Flotilla ship last month. That attempt to reach Gaza by sea, in early May, failed after another of the group’s vessels, the “Conscience”, was attacked by two alleged drones while sailing in international waters off the coast of Malta. The group blamed Israel for the attack,which damaged the front section of the ship, in the latest confrontation over efforts to send assistance to the Palestinian territory devastated by nearly 19 months of war. The Israeli government says the blockade is an attempt to pressure Hamas to release hostages it took during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the conflict. Hamas-led militants assaulted southern Israel that day, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. Hamas is still holding 58 hostages, 23 of whom are believed to be alive. In response, Israel launched an offensive that has killed over 52,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians. Israel’s bombardment and ground operations have destroyed vast areas of the territory and left most of its population homeless. The Flotilla group was only the latest among a growing number of critics to accuse Israel of genocidal acts in its war in Gaza. Israel vehemently denies the allegations, saying its war is directed at Hamas militants, not Gaza’s civilians. “We are breaking the siege of Gaza by sea, but that’s part of a broader strategy of mobilizations that will also attempt to break the siege by land,” said activist Thiago Avila. Avila cited the upcoming Global March to Gaza — an international initiative also open to doctors, lawyers and media — which is set to leave Egypt and reach the Rafah crossing in mid-June to stage a protest there, asking Israel to stop the Gaza offensive and reopen the border.",

    "article_text": "Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen and actor Hailee Steinfeld tied the knot on Saturday, according to multiple media reports. Pictures emerged from the power couple’s wedding that took place in Southern California, where both Allen and Steinfeld live. Photos obtained by “People” magazine show Steinfeld, in a white strapless gown, walking down the aisle as well as the couple sharing a kiss. The timing and location of the wedding were closely guarded secrets, though Bills left tackle Dion Dawkins let the cat out of the bag in March by revealing the date as May 31. He later backtracked, saying he didn’t know anything. Despite the pending wedding, Allen was present for thestart of the Bills voluntary series of spring practices, which opened on Tuesday. The Bills return to practice on Monday, though Allen isn’t scheduled to address the media until the Bills open their mandatory sessions on June 10. Allen, who turned 29 last week, and the 28-year-old Steinfeld were engaged during the Bills’ bye week in November, when the quarterbackproposed on a California cliffoverlooking the Pacific Ocean. The two were first linked in the spring of 2023, when they were photographed dining together in New York City. Steinfeld has since begun attending Bills home games and the couple was inseparable at the NFL Awards ceremony in February, when Allen credited Steinfeld upon accepting the league’s MVP honor. Allen followed suit in April in being spotted with Steinfeld arriving for an after-party following premier of the movie “Sinners,” which stars Steinfeld. Steinfeld began her acting career at the age of 10 and earned an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress for her role as Mattie Ross in the Coen brothers’ 2010 remake of “True Grit.” Allen is entering his eighth NFL season. In March, he signed a contract extension worth $330 million.",

    "article_text": "PARIS —Tommy Paulbecame the first American man in theFrench Openquarterfinals since Andre Agassi in 2003, beating 25th-seededAlexei Popyrinof Australia 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 in less than two hours Sunday. The 28-year-old Paul, who is seeded 12th at Roland-Garros, was coming off consecutive five-set victories but breezed to this victory, helped by saving 9 of 10 break points he faced while converting all but one of the six he accumulated. Both Paul and Popyrin won junior singles titles on the red clay in Paris, with the American’s coming a decade ago. Paul, who was a semifinalist at the Australian Open in 2023 on hard courts and a quarterfinalist at Wimbledon last year on grass courts, is now the only active U.S. man to reach the final eight at Grand Slam tournaments on three surfaces. There haven’t beenmultiple U.S. men in the French Open quarterfinals since 1996, when Jim Courier and Pete Sampras both made it that far. Agassi was the last from the country in the men’s semifinals at the French Open when he won the championship in 1999 to complete a career Grand Slam. Later Sunday, No. 13Ben Sheltonand No. 15 Frances Tiafoe played their fourth-round matches with a chance to join Paul in the quarterfinals. Shelton’s opponent wasdefending champion Carlos Alcarazof Spain, while Tiafoe faced Daniel Altmaier of Germany. Five American women reached the fourth round this year, with No. 16 Amanda Anisimova taking on No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka on Sunday. Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula, Madison Keys and Hailey Baptiste are scheduled to play for quarterfinal berths on Monday.",

    "title": "Trans athlete wins 2 girls events at California track and field finals",
    "article_text": "CLOVIS, Calif. — A transgender athlete bested the competition Saturday at the California high school track and field championship to take home gold in the girls high jump and the triple jump at a meet that has stirred controversy and drawn national attention. AB Hernandez competed under a new rule change that may be the first of its kind nationally by a high school sports governing body. California’s governing body changed the rules ahead of the meet to allow more girls to compete and medal in events in which Hernandez competed. Hernandez finished the high jump with a mark of 5 feet, 7 inches (1.7 meters), with no failed attempts. Co-winners Jillene Wetteland and Lelani Laruelle also cleared that height after each logged a failed attempt. The three shared the first-place win, smiling as they stepped together onto the podium. Hernandez wrapped up the night with a first place finish in the triple jump, sharing the top spot with Kira Gant Hatcher who trailed by just over a half-meter. Earlier in the afternoon, Hernandez placed second in the long jump. Olympians Marion Jones and Tara Davis-Woodhall previously set state championship records in the long jump in 1993 and 2017, respectively, both surpassing 22 feet (6.7 meters). This year’s winner, Loren Webster, topped 21 feet (6.40 meters), with Hernandez trailing by a few inches. The California Interscholastic Federation announced the new policy earlier this week in response to Hernandez’s success heading into the championships. Under the policy, the federation allowedan additional student to competeand medal in the events where Hernandez qualified. The two-day championship kicked off Friday in sweltering heat at a high school near Fresno. Temperatures reached the triple digits during Saturday’s finals. The atmosphere was relatively quiet despite critics — including parents, conservative activists and President Donald Trump — calling for Hernandez to be barred from competing. Some critics wore pink bracelets and T-shirts that read, “Save Girls’ Sports.” During Friday’s qualifying events, an aircraft circled above the stadium for more than an hour with a banner: “No Boys in Girls’ Sports!” Two groups that oppose transgender athletes participating in women’s sports — the Independent Council on Women’s Sports and Women Are Real — took credit for flying the banner. The federation’s rule change reflected efforts to find a middle ground in the debate over trans girls’ participation in youth sports. “The CIF values all of our student-athletes and we will continue to uphold our mission of providing students with the opportunity to belong, connect, and compete while complying with California law,” the group said in a statement after announcing its rule change. Arecent AP-NORC pollfound that about 7 in 10 U.S. adults think transgender female athletes should not be allowed to participate in girls and women’s sports at the high school, college or professional level. That view was shared by about 9 in 10 Republicans and roughly half of Democrats. The federation announced the change after Trump threatened to pull federal funding from California unless itbars trans female athletesfrom competing on girls teams. The federation said it decided on the change before then. The U.S. Department of Justice also said it would investigate the federation and the district that includes Hernandez’s high school to determine whether they violated federal sex discrimination law. California law allows trans students to compete on sex-segregated sports teams consistent with their gender identity. The federation said the rule opens the field to more “biological female” athletes. One expert said the change may itself be discriminatory because it creates an extra spot for “biological female” athletes but not for other trans athletes. The federation did not specify how it defines “biological female” or how it would verify whether a competitor meets that definition. Sophia Lorey, outreach director with California Family Council, was among those at the stadium Saturday. She said the federation’s policy is not a fix for the issue and only ends up causing more confusion. “At the end of the day,” Lorey said, “it shows the girls that we know this is wrong and we’re still letting it happen to you.” Hernandeztold the publication Capital & Mainthis month that she cannot worry about critics. “I’m still a child, you’re an adult, and for you to act like a child shows how you are as a person,” she said. California’s championship stands out from that of other states because of the sheer number of competitors. The state had the second-largest number of students participating in outdoor track and field in the nation during the 2023-2024 school year, behind Texas, according to a survey by the National Federation of State High School Associations. The boys 100-meter heats also were a highlight, with junior Jaden Jefferson of De La Salle High School in Concord finishing in 10.01 seconds Friday, 0.19 seconds faster than a meet record set in 2023. But he fell just shy of making it count as a meet record with a final time of 10.27 seconds in Saturday’s final. Athletes set new meet records in several events, including boys and girls relay races, hurdle competitions and the boys pole vault.",

    "article_text": "Shannon Bond An abandoned vehicle sits along the Swannanoa River in a landscape scarred by Hurricane Helene, on March 24, near Swannanoa, N.C.Sean Rayford/Getty Imageshide caption June 1 marks the start of hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean. Forecasters are warning this year could once again bring anabove-average numberof storms. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is predicting13 to 19 named stormsbetween June 1 and Nov. 30, compared with an average of 14 storms per yearfrom 1991-2020. Warmer ocean temperatures are contributing to more storms, NOAA said in its May forecast, becausemore heatmeans more energy to fuel activity. Experts say people should prepare well ahead of time — even if they live inland. \"It takes only one storm near you to make this an active season for you,\"professor Michael Bell, who leads Colorado State University's Tropical Cyclones, Radar, Atmospheric Modeling, and Software Team, said in a statement. Even storms that don't turn into hurricanes can cause deadly floods, and experts say water-related hazards cause most deaths related to hurricanes that make landfall. \"We want people now to take the advantage of the opportunity to best prepare, both at the coast and then also well inland, where serious impacts from flooding and wind and tornadoes can occur as well as a tropical storm or hurricane moves inland,\"Jon Porter, AccuWeather chief meteorologist, said in a video forecast on Friday. Scientists sayclimate changemeans storms are dumping more water and bringing more rain and damagefurther away from the coast. \"Hurricanes can have significant inland impacts,\" Michael Brennan, director of NOAA's National Hurricane Center, said at a press conference on Friday. \"It's important to get that message out to inland communities, especially in flood-prone areas, because that freshwater flooding has been such a significant source of fatalities in recent years.\" As this year's hurricane season neared, the Trump administration targeted weather and climate research. It fired hundreds of NOAA employees and proposedhundreds of millions of dollars in funding cutsat the agency for 2026, including gutting climate research and slashing funds for satellites that provide critical data for weather forecasts. Fired employees told NPR they fear the cuts willundermine improvements in hurricane forecasting, even as storms are getting more dangerous. The National Weather Service, which is part of NOAA, has lost more than500 workersthrough the cuts by the Elon Musk-ledDepartment of Government Efficiencyand the departure of those who took the government's early retirement offer. One of them is Brian LaMarre, who was a NWS meteorologist in the Tampa Bay area until he took early retirement in April. \"I don't think the current situation is sustainable,\"LaMarre told NPR's Scott Simonon May 24. \"When you have 122 offices and many of them are short-staffed … that right there is a recipe for disaster when you look at the long-range forecast.\" In May,Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick saidNOAA and the NWS were using \"the most advanced weather models and cutting-edge hurricane tracking systems to provide Americans with real-time storm forecasts and warnings.\" He added: \"With these models and forecasting tools, we have never been more prepared for hurricane season.\" NOAA is a part of the Department of Commerce. \"We're ready here, and that's what I can speak to is, directly, the readiness of us and our staff here at the National Hurricane Center,\" the NHC's Brennan said on Friday. \"We're ready to meet the needs of the [emergency management] community across the country as they come up this hurricane season, just as we always are.\" NOAA says six to 10 of 2025's forecast storms are expected to become full-blown hurricanes — with winds of 74 mph or higher — and three to five could be major hurricanes, with winds of 111 mph or above. That's in line with predictions from other forecasters, including atColorado State University, who said in April they expect 17 named storms and nine hurricanes, andAccuWeather, who are forecasting 13 to 18 named storms and seven to 10 hurricanes. In 2024, there were18 named Atlantic storms, andfive hurricanesthat made landfall in the U.S. That includedHurricane Helene, which killed more than200 peopleand caused devastating flooding across the southeastern U.S., andHurricane Milton, whose storm surge and accompanying tornadoes in southern Florida caused$34.3 billionin damage, according to NOAA.

    "title": "Ukraine destroys more than 40 military aircraft in a drone attack deep inside Russia",
    "article_text": "By The Associated Press In this image taken from video released June 1, 2025, by a source in the Ukrainian Security Service shows a Ukrainian drone striking Russian planes deep in Russia's territory.AP/Source in the Ukrainian Security Servicehide caption KYIV, Ukraine — A Ukrainian drone attack has destroyed more than 40 Russian planes deep in Russia's territory, a Ukrainian security official told The Associated Press on Sunday, while Russia pounded Ukraine with missiles and drones a day before the two sides meet for a new round of direct talks in Istanbul. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose operational details, said the attack took over 1 1/2-year to execute and was personally supervised by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The operation saw drones transported in containers carried by trucks deep into Russian territory, he said. The drones hit airfields including the Belaya air base in Russia's Irkutsk region, more than 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles) from Ukraine. It is the first time that a Ukrainian drone has been seen in the region, local Gov. Igor Kobzeva said, stressing that it did not present a threat to civilians. The attack was disclosed on the same day as Zelenskyy said Ukraine will send a delegation to Istanbul for a new round of direct peace talks with Russia on Monday. In a statement on Telegram, Zelenskyy said that Defense Minister Rustem Umerov will lead the Ukrainian delegation. \"We are doing everything to protect our independence, our state and our people,\" Zelenskyy said. Ukrainian officials had previously called on the Kremlin to provide a promised memorandum setting out its position on ending the war before the meeting takes place. Moscow had said it would share its memorandum during the talks. Russia on Sunday launched the biggest number of drones — 472 — on Ukraine since the full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukraine's air force said. Russian forces also launched seven missiles alongside the barrage of drones, said Yuriy Ignat, head of communications for the air force. Earlier Sunday, Ukraine's army said at least 12 Ukrainian service members were killed and more than 60 were injured in a Russian missile strike on an army training unit. The strike occurred at 12:50 p.m., the statement said, emphasizing that no formations or mass gatherings of personnel were being held at the time. An investigative commission was created to uncover the circumstances around the attack that led to such a loss in personnel, the statement said. The training unit is located to the rear of the 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) active front line, where Russian reconnaissance and strike drones are able to strike. Ukraine's forces suffer from manpower shortages and take extra precautions to avoid mass gatherings as the skies across the front line are saturated with Russian drones looking for targets. \"If it is established that the actions or inaction of officials led to the death or injury of servicemen, those responsible will be held strictly accountable,\" the Ukrainian Ground Forces' statement said. Russia's Ministry of Defense said Sunday that it had taken control of the village of Oleksiivka in Ukraine's northern Sumy region. Ukrainian authorities in Sumy ordered mandatory evacuations in 11 more settlements Saturday as Russian forces make steady gains in the area. Speaking Saturday, Ukraine's top army chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said that Russian forces were focusing their main offensive efforts on Pokrovsk, Toretsk and Lyman in the Donetsk region, as well as the Sumy border area.

    "title": "The women of No Sex for Fish are survivors — but their survival is precarious",
    "article_text": "By Viola Kosome , Photos by Julia Gunther Alice Akinyi (left, hand on hip) and Justine Adhiambo Obura, members of the No Sex For Fish group, stand next to Alice's fishing boat at Nduru Beach. It's one of the few boats that have weathered the storms and floods that have beset the area since 2020.Julia Gunther for NPRhide caption \"Our members are surviving with grace,\" says Justine Adhiambo Obura, the chairperson of No Sex for Fish. She's talking about a cooperative of 20 women who did the unthinkable. They are fishmongers from the village of Nduru Beach in Kenya who said no to fishermen who demanded:Give me sex, and I'll make sure you get fish to sell. With the support of various charities and programs, these women eventually got their own boats — and hired men to fish for them in Lake Victoria. The name of their group is a testament to their success. But in the year 2025, their survival is precarious. The No Sex for Fish women are coping with the legacy of disastrous floods that have virtually destroyed their village and disrupted the fishing business. And now they're facing new fears about their health. Starting in 2020, floods devastated the village of Nduru Beach, ruining the mud-walled homes. Virtually everyone left. Some residents found housing in temporary shelters set up along the road leading to the village.Julia Gunther for NPRhide caption Eleven of these women are HIV positive. Even as their lives were upended by the floods, they could count on getting a free supply of the anti-retroviral drugs they need to suppress the virus and stay healthy — supplied by the U.S. But in the wake of the Trump Administration's dramatic aid cutbacks, the women say they are seeing changes that make them anxious about the future — despite U.S. assurances that the supply of drugs will not be interrupted. Alice Akinyi, a No Sex For Fish member, waits to take a boat to Nduru Beach to get the latest catch from the fishermen to sell — roads were damaged by past floods so it's hard to get to the shore these days. She's one of only two members whose fishing boats are still functioning. The lower half of the house behind her — the area that's darker — was underwater during the peak of the flooding. The structure is no longer habitable.Julia Gunther for NPRhide caption Rebbeccah Atieno is a No Sex for Fish member who is HIV positive. A single mom with six kids, she lost her home in Nduru Beach to the floods and now lives in a house she had temporarily borrowed from a fellow villager who was not affected by the flood waters. But that neighbor expects her to move out from the house in August and find her own place. Their former village is now more like an island, cut off by the flood waters. But Atieno still returns — either by hiring a boat for $1 or wading through deep water — to meet fishermen who use one of the No Sex group's two surviving boats and obtain a catch she can sell to earn money for food and school fees. While scaling a piece of tilapia with a blunt knife, she shares her worries. Rebbeccah Atieno, a No Sex For Fish member, scales and guts the fish she bought from fellow member Alice Akinyi at Nduru Beach, getting them ready to sell.Julia Gunther for NPRhide caption She says that up until this year she thought her major struggle would be \"the displacement from my home\" because of the flooding — and earning a living. Now she has an additional worry: Will she be able to get the antiretroviral drugs she needs to suppress the HIV virus and stay healthy? \"They used to give me ARVs of up to 6 months but that has currently reduced to only one month,\" she says, referring to the clinic that distributes the drugs. It's an hour's walk each way, and now she must make more frequent trips — an additional hardship in the hard life of a working single mother. \"We are scared of what the future holds,\" she says. Rebbeccah Atieno (left) sits inside her current home, along with No Sex For Fish chairwoman Justine Adhiambo Obura and fellow member Naomy Akoth.Julia Gunther for NPRhide caption So what did happen exactly? There are conflicting narratives. The Trump administration has repeatedly said that the supply of life-saving drugs would not be affected by the dramatic reduction in foreign aid. But according to Dr. Fredrick Oluoch, the director of public health in Kisumu County, where Otieno lives, the U.S. cutbacks have caused interruptions in the supply chain that gets drugs into the hands of those who need them. It's a complicated situation, explains a source who previously worked for PEPFAR, the U.S. agency that targets HIV prevention and who spoke on the condition of anonymity \"to avoid professional or institutional pushback that could prevent me from speaking further.\" The source said that a number of USAID contracts in Kenya and elsewhere that covered anti-retroviral medications were halted and \"took a while to restart.\" What's more, some clinics relied on U.S.-funded programs to get the drugs to the clinics where they are handed out. And the government has stated that some 41,000 health workers lost their U.S.-funded jobs in the wake of the aid cutback. \"The ability to access and deliver HIV medications was interrupted due to clinic closures, firing tens of thousands of health care workers, and interruptions in supply chain delivery,\" the source says. The government has pledged to continue the distribution of these vital drugs, has since rehired many of the people who lost their jobs and has urged the public not to be afraid. But it has not provided a full explanation of how patients will again be able to get a larger supply of drugs at one visit. So even though there does not appear to be a shortage of anti-retroviral drugs in Kenya at this time, there is tremendous uncertainty, the source says. As a result, some clinics are hoarding the drugs they do have. This hoarding may also reflect the mindset in Kenya of a few years ago, when there was an actual shortage of anti-HIV drugs. \"People are telling me that they're moving toward solutions,\" the former PEPFAR employee said. \"But if you're the woman who is a day wage earner and have to figure out a way to go every two weeks to get your care when you were going every six months, I'm sure it's upsetting and disturbing.\" \"There is a lot of anxiety, stress, depression among even the HIV patients because they don't know the future,\" says Oluoch. \"They don't know whether they are going to get their medication.\" Erick Okioma, an advocate for people with HIV, believes the Kenyan government should address any gaps in funding for HIV services caused by U.S. aid cuts.Julia Gunther for NPRhide caption In response to an inquiry from NPR, a U.S. State Department spokesperson noted that \"PEPFAR-funded programs that deliver HIV care and treatment or prevention of mother to child transmission services are operational for a majority [of] beneficiaries. \"All other PEPFAR-funded services, including those provided by other agencies, are currently being reviewed for assessment of programmatic efficiencies and consistency with United States foreign policy. PEPFAR, like all assistance programs, should be reduced over time if it achieves its mission. We are enhancing service delivery efficiency and advancing PEPFAR partner countries toward self-reliance.\" Erick Okioma, an HIV activist and the team leader for the Nelson Mandela TB, HIV Information organization, has been living with HIV for 20 years, believes the cuts are a wake-up call to the government. \"I am definitely worried because the quality of services is going to go down. I can say that unless something is done, we might go back many years. Many years back,\" he says, referring to the not-so-distant past. According to the Ministry of Health, since 2010, Kenya has reduced new HIV infections by more than 67%, from 101,000 cases in 2010 to 16,752 infections in 2024. The women of No Sex for Fish know all too well how dangerous HIV can be without preventive pills. Rose Atieno Abongo, a mother of six who was HIV positive, died last October — before the aid upheaval of 2025 worries. Yet her death is a reminder of how critical the anti-HIV medications are. Jack Len'go holds a photo of his wife, Rose Atieno Abongo, who was a member of the No Sex for Fish group. The photo was taken in 2019, when an NPR team first reported on this story. Rose died in October 2024 of complications from HIV/AIDS. Len'go says she'd stopped taking her preventive drugs because she was not getting proper nutrition and the pills were making her sick. Rose is buried next to their home.Julia Gunther for NPRhide caption Her husband, Jack, says that the family couldn't afford decent meals as their income from selling fish disappeared. He says Rose would sometimes vomit after taking her drugs, So eventually, she stopped taking the antiretrovirals. She gave up on life, he says. She developed respiratory problems and a kidney infection, he says, and died of AIDS. Jack is HIV positive as well. \"I have also been taking my drugs from health center,\" he says — that's the Nyang'ande Sub-County Hospital. But he worries: Will clinics run out of pills? He has a teenage daughter who is also HIV positive. She keeps asking how long there will be medication for her and her dad. \"I have been trying my best to assure the child that all will be well but it is not easy. The fear and anxiety is real,\" he says. Naomy Akoth, who's 42, also has fears about when and how she will get her next dose of ARV drugs. Naomy Akoth must walk 40 minutes each way to get her supply of HIV preventive drugs. Since the U.S. aid cuts the clinic is distributing fewer pills at each visit, causing her to worry.Julia Gunther for NPRhide caption Like most of the HIV positive women from the No Sex for Fish group, she picks up her drugs at  Nyang'ande hospital — a 40-minute walk each way from the temporary housing she found after being displaced by the floods. Adding to her worries is the difficulty earning money to care for her seven children. With the fishing boat that she'd once had now gone, she says, \"My small hotel business barely makes three dollars in a day,\" she says. And she worries that someday she will have to pay for the HIV medications — although at this time the government has pledged to continue distributing free pills. \"It is our prayer that the government will do something to avert a crisis,\" she says. Akoth contracted the disease after her husband died in 2002 and, pressured by local tradition to marry again so a man could take care of her family, she wed a fisherman who was HIV positive. It is a decision she regrets but she says there was nothing much she could have done to avoid this fate. She has since separated from her husband. Dr. Theresa Opiyo of Nyang'ande Sub-County Hospital, Kisumu, says that patients with HIV now need counseling to cope with their fears that the supply of drugs to suppress the virus might be affected by U.S. aid cuts. So far the impact has been that patients get fewer pills when they visit — perhaps a supply for one month rather than for half a year.Julia Gunther for NPRhide caption Theresa Opiyo, a doctor at the Nyang'ande health facility who supports HIV patients, says she is now counseling patients who are worried about the future. \"The withdrawal of support has had a significant negative impact and has caused stress and unanswered questions,\" says Opiyo. She adds that she too is feeling stress from all the uncertainties. And it's not just the distribution of medication that's on her mind. Opiyo says that educational programs aimed at educating the public about HIV transmission have been put on hold due to aid cuts. \"Through the program, we were able to prevent the spread of HIV among adolescents,\" she says. \"The impact was huge because it also helped reduce mother-to-child transmission.\" Justine Obura, the chairperson of the No Sex For Fish Group, says the group members are trying to support each other. \"We have also been able to maintain a table banking platform that enables us to save and share,\" she says. No Sex For Fish member Naomy Akoth makes notes during a \"table banking\" session. Members contribute to a pool of money; those in need can ask for a loan.Julia Gunther for NPRhide caption \"Table banking\" is the term for an informal savings association. Members who are able to earn money — from selling fish, from growing vegetables — contribute regularly. Members who need cash can ask for a loan with the expectation that they'll eventually repay it. Sometimes the request is for cash to cover the cost of a cab to get to the clinic where they pick up their antiretroviral drugs. They meet at Justine Obura's home. After the floods of 2020 wiped out much of their village, she used her savings to buy land about 5 miles from Nduru Beach, where she built a house and now raises vegetables to earn income. Alice Akinyi at Justine Obura's home just before a Sunday \"table banking\" session.Julia Gunther for NPRhide caption Alice Akinyi Amonde is one of two members who still has a functioning boat. She herself is not HIV positive but says she and others offer both moral and financial support when possible, paying for transportation to reach a clinic that will provide the drugs they need. But she admits that her own financial prospects are far from secure. \"The income is low because the catch keeps dwindling,\" says Amonde. The women of No Sex for Fish gather for a Sunday \"table banking\" session to collect contributions and assess requests for loans. They're meeting at Justine Obura's home.Julia Gunther for NPRhide caption In spite of the uncertainty they face, these women are still bold planners. Obura says they hope to get help from a donor to start farming rice and for other agricultural endeavors. Yet it can be hard to hold on to hope. \"We are living a daily nightmare,\" says Rebbeccah Atieno. \"Hope is diminishing every day for our members. But we are still holding on, praying that the floods will recede and the uninterrupted supply of vital life-saving drugs will resume.\" Viola Kosome is a Kenyan journalist.

    "article_text": "By The Associated Press Soccer fans celebrate PSG's victory on the Champs-Elysees avenue, with the Arc de Triomphe in background, after the Champions League final soccer match between Paris Saint-Germain and Inter Milan, Sunday, June 1, 2025 in Paris.Aurelien Morissard/APhide caption PARIS — Two fans died and a police officer is in a coma after mass nationwide celebrations for Paris Saint-Germain's historic Champions League victory, European soccer's biggest prize, French authorities said Sunday. A 17-year-old boy was stabbed to death in the city of Dax during a PSG street party after Saturday night's final in Munich, the national police service said. A man was killed in Paris when his scooter was hit by a car during PSG celebrations, the interior minister's office said. The circumstances of both are being investigated. A police officer was hit accidentally by fireworks in Coutance in northwest France and placed in an artificial coma because of grave eye injuries, the national police service said. Hundreds of people were arrested in the celebrations, which were largely peaceful but degenerated into violence in some areas. The team is expected to return to a big parade on the Champs-Elysees on Sunday after clinching its first Champions League title, a 5-0 win over Inter Milan. At the top of the Champs-Élysées avenue, a water cannon was used to protect the Place de l'Étoile, near the landmark Arc de Triomphe. Police said a large crowd not watching the match tried to push through a barrier to make contact with police. By 2 a.m. Sunday, a total of 294 arrests had been made, including 30 people who broke into a shoe shop on the Champs-Élysées. Two cars were set alight close to Parc des Princes, police added. At the Place de la Bastille, there were joyous scenes as fans climbed onto the base of the famous column, singing, dancing and letting off flares, while those around joined in. At one point, motorbikes loudly revved their engines and the crowd cheered as they did laps around the column. There were no police nearby and, by 1 a.m., the atmosphere was upbeat with no tensions and plenty of singing. Security had been tightened up in anticipation of potential post-match violence and 5,400 police officers were deployed on the Champs-Élysées, other key parts of Paris, and its nearby suburbs.

    "title": "At least seven dead after two Russian bridges collapse",
    "article_text": "By The Associated Press This photo released by Acting Governor of the Kursk Region Alexander Khinshtein telegram channel on Sunday, June 1, 2025, shows a view of a damaged bridge after the crash of a freight train in Russia's Kursk region, which borders Ukraine.AP/Acting Governor of the Kursk Region Alexander Khinshteinhide caption Explosions caused two bridges to collapse and derailed two trains in western Russia overnight, officials said Sunday, without saying what had caused the blasts. In one of the incidents, seven people were killed and dozens were injured. The first bridge, in the Bryansk region on the border with Ukraine, collapsed on top of a passenger train on Saturday, causing the casualties. The train's driver was among those killed, state-run Russian Railways said. Hours later, officials said a second train derailed when the bridge beneath it collapsed in the nearby Kursk region, which also borders Ukraine. In that collapse, a freight train was thrown off its rails onto the road below as the explosion collapsed the bridge, local acting Gov. Alexander Khinshtein said Sunday. The crash sparked a fire, but there were no casualties, he said. Russia's Investigative Committee, the country's top criminal investigation agency, said in a statement that explosions had caused the two bridges to collapse, but did not give further details. Several hours later, it edited the statement, which was posted on social media, to remove the words \"explosions\" but did not provide an explanation. The committee said that it would be investigating the incidents as potential acts of terrorism. Rescue workers cleared debris from both sites, while some of those injured were transported to Moscow for treatment. Photos posted by government agencies in Bryansk appeared to show train carriages ripped apart and lying amid fallen concrete from the collapsed bridge. Other footage on social media was apparently taken from inside vehicles on the road that had managed to avoid driving onto the bridge before it collapsed. Damage to railway tracks was also found Sunday by inspectors working on the line elsewhere in the Bryansk region, Moscow Railway said in a statement. It did not say whether the damage was linked to the collapsed bridges. In the past, some officials have accused pro-Ukrainian saboteurs of attacking Russia's railway infrastructure. The details surrounding such incidents, however, are limited and cannot be independently verified. Ukraine's military intelligence, known by the Ukrainian abbreviation GUR, said Sunday that a Russian military freight train carrying food and fuel had been blown up on its way to Crimea. It did not claim the attack was carried out by GUR or mention the bridge collapses. The statement said Moscow's key artery with the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia region and Crimea has been destroyed. Russia forces have been pushing into the region of Zaporizhzhia in eastern Ukraine since Moscow's full-scale invasion in February 2022. Russia took Crimea and annexed it in 2014.

    "title": "Squid Game trailer anchors Netflix Tudum event",
    "article_text": "Also:WednesdayS2 sneak peek,Stranger ThingsS5 premiere date,Frankensteinteaser, more Benoit Blanc Netflix held its Tudum Global Fan Event in Los Angeles this weekend to showcase its upcoming slate of programming. Among the highlights: the official trailer for the third and final season ofSquid Game, the first six minutes ofWednesdayS2, a teaser for Guillermo del Toro'sFrankenstein, and date announcements for the fifth and final season ofStranger Things,as well asWake Up Dead Man: a Knives Out Mystery. (Some spoilers below.) Aspreviously reported, Squid Game's first season followed Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-Jae), a down-on-his-luck gambler who has little left to lose when he agrees to play children's playground games against 455 other players for money. The twist? If you lose a game, you die. If you cheat, you die. And if you win, you might also die. In the S1 finale, Gi-hun faced off against fellow finalist and childhood friend Cho Sang-woo (Park Hae-soo) in the titular \"squid game.\" He won their fight but refused to kill his friend. Sang-woo instead stabbed himself in the neck, leaving Gi-hun the guilt-ridden winner. S2 was set three years later. Gi-hun successfully finagled his way back into the game, intent on revenge against the Front Man (Lee Byung-hun). Meanwhile, Front Man's police officer brother, Jun-ho (Wi Ha-joon), hired mercenaries to track down the island where the game is staged. Alliances formed and shifted as the games proceeded, with betrayals galore, culminating in the loss of Gi-hun's friend and ally Player 390 and a cliffhanger ending. Series creator Hwang Dong-hyuk conceived of S2 and S3 as a single season, but there were too many episodes, so he split them over two seasons. Back in January we got our first glimpse of S3 when Netflix released a15-second teaseron X, introducing a brand new killer doll dubbed Chul-su—similar to the giant \"Red Light, Green Light\" doll Young-hee. Per the official premise: A failed rebellion, the death of a friend, and a secret betrayal. Picking up in the aftermath of Season 2’s bloody cliffhanger, the third and final season of Netflix’s most popular series finds Gi-hun, a.k.a. Player 456, at his lowest point yet. But the Squid Game stops for no one, so Gi-hun will be forced to make some important choices in the face of overwhelming despair as he and the surviving players are thrust into deadlier games that test everyone’s resolve. With each round, their choices lead to increasingly grave consequences. Meanwhile, In-ho resumes his role as Front Man to welcome the mysterious VIPs, and his brother Jun-ho continues his search for the elusive island, unaware there’s a traitor in their midst. Will Gi-hun make the right decisions, or will Front Man finally break his spirit? The third season ofSquid Gamedrops on Netflix on June 27, 2025. Star Jenna Ortega put her own stamp on the iconic title character in the first season ofWednesday.At Tudum, Netflix introduced footage of S2's first six minutes with a performance by Lady Gaga, who emerged from a coffin to perform a couple of spooky numbers—including \"Bloody Mary\" fromBorn This Way. (We can thank a a viral video featuring the tune set to Wednesday's fantastic S1 dancing sequence for that.) Aspreviously reported, along with Ortega, most of the main cast is returning for S2, including Emma Myers as Enid, and Joy Sunday as Bianca. Reprising their roles: Luis Guzman and Catherine Zeta-Jones as Gomez and Morticia Addams; Isaac Ordonez as Pugsley Addams; Victor Dorobantu as Thing; Fred Armisen as Uncle Fester; Luyanda Unati Lewis-Nyawo as Deputy Ritchie Santiago; Hunter Doohan as Tyler Galpin, revealed as a murderous Hyde in the S1 finale; and Jamie McShane as Donovan Galpin, the Jericho sheriff and Tyler's father (McShane is a guest this season). We'll miss Gwendoline Christie's Principal Larissa Weems and Christina Ricci's diabolical botany teacher, Marilyn Thornhill (RIP to both), but at least we're getting the fabulous Joanna Lumley as Hester Frump, Morticia's mother. Other new cast members include Billie Piper as Capri, Steve Buscemi as new Nevermore principle Barry Dort, and Evie Templeton, Owen Painter, and Noah Tyler in as-yet-undisclosed roles. Bonus: Lady Gaga will make a guest appearance in the show and as we see in the new footage, Haley Joel Osment makes a cameo. WednesdayS2 will air in two installments. Part 1 debuts August 6, 2025. Part 2 is coming on September 3, 2025. It's been a long, wild ride with the plucky residents of Hawkins, but we're finally approaching the ultimate showdown against the dark force that has plagued the town since S1. The fifth season will have eight episodes and each one will be looong—akin to eight feature-length films. In addition to the returning main cast, Amybeth McNulty and Gabriella Pizzolo are back as Vicki and Dustin's girlfriend, Suzie, respectively, with Jamie Campbell Bower reprising his role as the ultimate Big Bad, now known as Vecna. Linda Hamilton joins the cast as Dr. Kay, along with Nell Fisher as Holly Wheeler, Jake Connelly as Derek Turnbow, and Alex Breaux as Lt. Akers S4 ended with Vecna opening the gate that allowed the Upside Down to leak into Hawkins. We're getting a time jump for S5, but in a way we're coming full circle, since the events coincide with the third anniversary of Will's original disappearance in S1. Per the official premise: The fall of 1987. Hawkins is scarred by the opening of the Rifts, and our heroes are united by a single goal: find and kill Vecna. But he has vanished — his whereabouts and plans unknown.  Complicating their mission, the government has placed the town under military quarantine and intensified its hunt for Eleven, forcing her back into hiding. As the anniversary of Will’s disappearance approaches, so does a heavy, familiar dread. The final battle is looming—and with it, a darkness more powerful and more deadly than anything they’ve faced before.  To end this nightmare, they’ll need everyone—the full party — standing together, one last time. The fifth and final season ofStranger Thingswill drop in not one, not two, but three installments, because apparently Netflix wants to be as annoying as possible. Volume 1 premieres on November 26, 2025; Volume 2 drops on Christmas Day, December 25, 2025; and the series finale will air on New Year’s Eve, December 31, 2025. Oscar-wining director Guillermo del Toro has been dreaming of adapting Mary Shelley'sFrankensteinfor the big screen for more than a decade. There have been so many adaptations of Shelley's novel, of varying quality, and even more reinventions and homages (cf.Poor Things) We finally have the first teaser for del Toro's take, and it's as sumptuously horrifying and visually rich as one would expect from the man who made such films asPan's LabyrinthandThe Shape of Water. Per the official premise: \"“A brilliant but egotistical scientist brings a creature to life in a monstrous experiment that ultimately leads to the undoing of both the creator and his tragic creation.” The events take place in 19th century Eastern Europe. Oscar Isaac stars as Victor Frankenstein, with Jacob Elordi playing the monster. Christopher Waltz plays Dr. Pretorious, who hopes to continue in Victor's footsteps by tracking his monster—who, it turns out, did not die in a fire 40 years before. The cast also includes Mia Goth as Victor's fiancee, Elizabeth; Felix Kammerer as Williams; Lars Mikkelsen as Captain Anderson; David Bradley as a blind man; and Ralph Inseon as Professor Kempre. Charles Dance will also appear in as as-yet-undisclosed role. Frankensteinpremieres on Netflix in November 2025. Rian Johnson'sKnives Outseries of films is still going strong, with the third installment featuring Daniel Craig's languorously brilliant detective, Benoit Blanc slated to premiere a couple of weeks before Christmas. It's calledWake Up Dead Man, a title that pays homage to the 1997 U2 song of the same name. Johnson is playing his cards close to the chest about the plot details. But we do know he's assembled another all-star cast of murderous suspects: Josh O'Connor, Glenn Close, Josh Brolin, Mila Kunis, Jeremy Renner—whose \"Renning Hot\" chili pepper sauce featured prominently inGlass Onion—Kerry Washington, Andrew Scott, Cailee Spaeny, Daryl McCormack, and Thomas Haden Church. Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mysterydrops on Netflix on December 12, 2025—or if you want to be all Benoit Blanc about it, XII.XII.MMXXV.

    "title": "Breaking down why Apple TVs are privacy advocates’ go-to streaming device",
    "article_text": "Using the Apple TV app or an Apple account means giving Apple more data, though. Every time I write an article about the escalatingadvertising and trackingontoday's TVs, someone brings up Apple TV boxes. Among smart TVs, streaming sticks, and other streaming devices, Apple TVs are largely viewed as a safe haven. \"Just disconnect your TV from the Internet and use an Apple TV box.\" That's the common guidance you'll hear from Ars readers for those seeking the joys of streaming without giving up too much privacy. Based on our research and the experts we've consulted, that advice is pretty solid, as Apple TVs offer significantly more privacy than other streaming hardware providers. But how private are Apple TV boxes, really? Apple TVs don't useautomatic content recognition(ACR, a user-tracking technology leveraged by nearly all smart TVs and streaming devices), but could that change? And what about the software that Apple TV users do use—could those apps provide information about you to advertisers or Apple? In this article, we'll delve into what makes the Apple TV's privacy stand out and examine whether users should expect the limited ads and enhanced privacy to last forever. One of the simplest ways Apple TVs ensure better privacy is through their setup process, during which you can disable Siri, location tracking, and sending analytics data to Apple. During setup, users also receive several opportunities to review Apple's data and privacy policies. Also off by default is the boxes' ability to send voice input data to Apple. Most other streaming devices require users to navigate through pages of settings to disable similar tracking capabilities, which most people are unlikely to do. Apple’s approach creates a line of defense against snooping, even for those unaware of how invasive smart devices can be. Apple TVs running tvOS 14.5 and later also make third-party app tracking more difficult by requiring such apps to request permission before they can track users. \"If you choose Ask App Not to Track, the app developer can’t access the system advertising identifier (IDFA), which is often used to track,\"Apple says. \"The app is also not permitted to track your activity using other information that identifies you or your device, like your email address.\" Users can access the Apple TV settings and disable the ability of third-party apps to ask permission for tracking. However, Apple could further enhance privacy by enabling this setting by default. The Apple TV also lets users control which apps can access the set-top box's Bluetooth functionality, photos, music, and HomeKit data (if applicable), and the remote's microphone. \"Apple’s primary business model isn’t dependent on selling targeted ads, so it has somewhat less incentive to harvest and monetize incredible amounts of your data,\" said RJ Cross, director of the consumer privacy program at the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG). \"I personally trust them more with my data than other tech companies.\" If you allow your Apple TV to share analytics data with Apple or app developers, that data won't be personally identifiable,Apple says. Any collected personal data is \"not logged at all, removed from reports before they’re sent to Apple, or protected by techniques, such as differential privacy,\" Apple says. Differential privacy, which injects noise into collected data, is one of the most common methods used for anonymizing data. In support documentation (PDF), Apple details its use of differential privacy: The first step we take is to privatize the information using local differential privacy on the user’s device. The purpose of privatization is to assure that Apple’s servers don't receive clear data. Device identifiers are removed from the data, and it is transmitted to Apple over an encrypted channel. The Apple analysis system ingests the differentially private contributions, dropping IP addresses and other metadata. The final stage is aggregation, where the privatized records are processed to compute the relevant statistics, and the aggregate statistics are then shared with relevant Apple teams. Both the ingestion and aggregation stages are performed in a restricted access environment so even the privatized data isn’t broadly accessible to Apple employees. Another factor to consider is Apple's privacy policy regarding Apple accounts, formerly Apple IDs. Apple support documentationsaysyou \"need\" an Apple account to use an Apple TV, but you can use the hardware without one. Still, it's common for people to log into Apple accounts on their Apple TV boxes because it makes it easier to link with other Apple products. Another reason someone might link an Apple TV box with an Apple account is to use the Apple TV app, a common way to stream on Apple TV boxes. So what type of data does Apple harvest from Apple accounts? According to itsprivacy policy, the company gathers usage data, such as \"data about your activity on and use of\" Apple offerings, including \"app launches within our services...; browsing history; search history; [and] product interaction.\" Other types of data Apple may collect from Apple accounts include transaction information (Apple says this is \"data about purchases of Apple products and services or transactions facilitated by Apple, including purchases on Apple platforms\"), account information (\"including email address, devices registered, account status, and age\"), device information (including serial number and browser type), contact information (including physical address and phone number), and payment information (including bank details). None of that is surprising considering the type of data needed to make an Apple account work. Many Apple TV users can expect Apple to gather more data from their Apple account usage on other devices, such as iPhones or Macs. However, if you use the same Apple account across multiple devices, Apple recognizes that all the data it has collected from, for example, your iPhone activity, also applies to you as an Apple TV user. A potential workaround could be maintaining multiple Apple accounts. With an Apple account solely dedicated to your Apple TV box and Apple TV hardware and software tracking disabled as much as possible, Apple would have minimal data to ascribe to you as an Apple TV owner. You can also use your Apple TV box without an Apple account, but then you won't be able to use the Apple TV app, one of the device's key features. You can download third-party apps like Netflix and Hulu onto an Apple TV box, but most TV and movie watching on Apple TV boxes likely occurs via the Apple TV app. The app is necessary for watching content on the Apple TV+ streaming service, but it also drives usage by providing access to the libraries of many (but not all) popular streaming apps in one location. So understanding the Apple TV app’s privacy policy is critical to evaluating how private Apple TV activity truly is. As expected, some of the data the app gathers is necessary for the software to work. That includes, according to the app'sprivacy policy, \"information about your purchases, downloads, activity in the Apple TV app, the content you watch, and where you watch it in the Apple TV app and in connected apps on any of your supported devices.\" That all makes sense for ensuring that the app remembers things like which episode ofSeveranceyou're on across devices. Apple collects other data, though, that isn't necessary for functionality. It says it gathers data on things like the \"features you use (for example, Continue Watching or Library),\" content pages you view, how you interact with notifications, and approximate location information (that Apple says doesn't identify users) to help improve the app. Additionally, Apple tracks the terms you search for within the app, per its policy: We use Apple TV search data to improve models that power Apple TV. For example, aggregate Apple TV search queries are used to fine-tune the Apple TV search model. This data usage is less intrusive than that of other streaming devices, which might track your activity and then sell that data to third-party advertisers. But some people may be hesitant about havinganyof their activities tracked to benefit a multi-trillion-dollar conglomerate. By default, the Apple TV app also tracks \"what you watch, your purchases, subscriptions, downloads, browsing, and other activities in the Apple TV app\" to make personalized content recommendations. Content recommendations aren't ads in the traditional sense but instead provide a way for Apple to push you toward products by analyzing data it has on you. You can disable the Apple TV app's personalized recommendations, but it's a little harder than you might expect since you can't do it through the app. Instead, you need to go to the Apple TV settings and then select Apps > TV > Use Play History > Off. The most privacy-conscious users may wish that personalized recommendations were off by default. Darío Maestro, senior legal fellow at the nonprofit Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (STOP), noted to Ars that even though Apple TV users can opt out of personalized content recommendations, \"many will not realize they can.\" Apple can also use data it gathers on you from the Apple TV app to serve traditional ads. If you allow your Apple TV box to track your location, the Apple TV app can also track your location. That data can \"be used to serve geographically relevant ads,\" according to the Apple TV app privacy policy. Location tracking, however, is off by default on Apple TV boxes. Apple's tvOS doesn't have integrated ads. For comparison, some TV OSes,like Roku OSandLG's webOS, show ads on the OS's home screen and/or whenshowing screensavers. But data gathered from the Apple TV app can still help Apple's advertising efforts. This can happen if you allow personalized ads inotherApple apps serving targeted apps, such as Apple News, the App Store, or Stocks. In such cases, Apple may apply data gathered from the Apple TV app, \"including information about the movies and TV shows you purchase from Apple, to serve ads in those apps that are more relevant to you,\" the Apple TV app privacy policy says. Apple also provides third-party advertisers and strategic partners with \"non-personal data\" gathered from the Apple TV app: We provide some non-personal data to our advertisers and strategic partners that work with Apple to provide our products and services, help Apple market to customers, and sell ads on Apple’s behalf to display on the App Store and Apple News and Stocks. Apple also shares non-personal data from the Apple TV with third parties, such as content owners, so they can pay royalties, gauge how much people are watching their shows or movies, \"and improve their associated products and services,\" Apple says. Apple's policy notes: For example, we may share non-personal data about your transactions, viewing activity, and region, as well as aggregated user demographics[,] such as age group and gender (which may be inferred from information such as your name and salutation in your Apple Account), to Apple TV strategic partners, such as content owners, so that they can measure the performance of their creative work [and] meet royalty and accounting requirements. When reached for comment, an Apple spokesperson told Ars that Apple TV users can clear their play history from the app. All that said, the Apple TV app still shares far less data with third parties than other streaming apps. Netflix, for example,saysit discloses some personal information to advertising companies \"in order to select Advertisements shown on Netflix, to facilitate interaction with Advertisements, and to measure and improve effectiveness of Advertisements.\" Warner Bros. Discoverysaysit discloses information about Max viewers \"with advertisers, ad agencies, ad networks and platforms, and other companies to provide advertising to you based on your interests.\" And Disney+ users have Nielsen tracking on by default. You can easily deactivate Siri when setting up an Apple TV. But those who opt to keep the voice assistant and the ability to control Apple TV with their voice take somewhat of a privacy hit. According to the privacy policy accessible in Apple TV boxes' settings, Apple boxes automatically send all Siri requests to Apple's servers. If you opt into using Siri data to \"Improve Siri and Dictation,\" Apple will store your audio data. If you opt out, audio data won't be stored, but per the policy: In all cases, transcripts of your interactions will be sent to Apple to process your requests and may be stored by Apple. Apple TV boxes also send audio and transcriptions of dictation input to Apple servers for processing. Apple says it doesn't store the audio but may store transcriptions of the audio. If you opt to \"Improve Siri and Dictation,\" Apple says your history of voice requests isn't tied to your Apple account or email. But Apple is vague about how long it may store data related to voice input performed with the Apple TV if you choose this option. The policy states: Your request history, which includes transcripts and any related request data, is associated with a random identifier for up to six months and is not tied to your Apple Account or email address. After six months, you request history is disassociated from the random identifier and may be retained for up to two years. Apple may use this data to develop and improve Siri, Dictation, Search, and limited other language processing functionality in Apple products ... Apple may also review a subset of the transcripts of your interactions and this ... may be kept beyond two years for the ongoing improvements of products and services. Apple promises not to use Siri and voice data to build marketing profiles or sell them to third parties, but it hasn't always adhered to that commitment. In January, Apple agreed topay $95 millionto settle a class-action lawsuit accusing Siri of recording private conversations and sharing them with third parties for targeted ads. In 2019, contractorsreportedhearing private conversations and recorded sex via Siri-gathered audio. Outside of Apple, we've seen voice request dataused questionably, includingin criminal trialsandby corporate employees. Siri and dictation data also represent additional ways a person's Apple TV usage might be unexpectedly analyzed to fuel Apple's business. Apple TVs aren't preloaded withautomatic content recognition(ACR), an Apple spokesperson confirmed to Ars, another plus for privacy advocates. But ACR is software, so Apple could technically add it to Apple TV boxes via a software update at some point. Sherman Li, the founder of Enswers, the company that first putACR in Samsung TVs, confirmed to Ars that it's technically possible for Apple to add ACR to already-purchased Apple boxes. Years ago, Enswers retroactively added ACR to other types of streaming hardware, including Samsung and LG smart TVs. (Enswers was acquired by Gracenote, which Nielsen now owns.) In general, though, there are challenges to adding ACR to hardware that people already own, Li explained: Everyone believes, in theory, you can add ACR anywhere you want at any time because it's software, but because of the way [hardware is] architected... the interplay between the chipsets, like the SoCs, and the firmware is different in a lot of situations. Li pointed to numerous variables that could prevent ACR from being retroactively added to any type of streaming hardware, \"including access to video frame buffers, audio streams, networking connectivity, security protocols, OSes, and app interface communication layers, especially at different levels of the stack in these devices, depending on the implementation.\" Due to the complexity of Apple TV boxes, Li suspects it would be difficult to add ACR to already-purchased Apple TVs. It would likely be simpler for Apple to release a new box with ACR if it ever decided to go down that route. If Apple were to add ACR to old or new Apple TV boxes, the devices would be far less private, and the move would be highly unpopular and eliminate one of the Apple TV's biggest draws. However, Apple reportedly has a growing interest in advertising to streaming subscribers. The Apple TV+ streaming service doesn't currently show commercials, but the company is rumored to be exploring a potential ad tier. The suspicions stem from a reported meeting between Apple and the United Kingdom's ratings body, Barb, to discuss how it might track ads on Apple TV+, according to a July report fromThe Telegraph. Since 2023, Apple has also hired severalprominent names in advertising, including a former head of advertising at NBCUniversaland a new head of video ad sales. Further, Apple TV+ is one of the few streaming services to remain ad-free, and it's reported to belosing Apple $1 billion per yearsince its launch. One day soon, Apple may have much more reason to care about advertising in streaming and being able to track the activities of people who use its streaming offerings. That has implications for Apple TV box users. \"The more Apple creeps into the targeted ads space, the less I’ll trust them to uphold their privacy promises. You can imagine Apple TV being a natural progression for selling ads,\" PIRG's Cross said. Somewhat ironically, Apple has marketed its approach to privacy as a positive for advertisers. \"Apple’s commitment to privacy and personal relevancy builds trust amongst readers, driving a willingness to engage with content and ads alike,\" Apple'sadvertising guidefor buying ads on Apple News and Stocks reads. It remains technologically possible for Apple to introduce intrusive tracking or ads to Apple TV boxes, but for now, the streaming devices are more private than the vast majority of alternatives, save for dumb TVs (which are incredibly hard to find these days). And if Apple follows its own policies, much of the data it gathers should be kept in-house. However, those with strong privacy concerns should be aware that Apple does track certain tvOS activities, especially those that happen through Apple accounts, voice interaction, or the Apple TV app. And while most of Apple's streaming hardware and software settings prioritize privacy by default, some advocates believe there's room for improvement. For example, STOP's Maestro said: Unlike in the [European Union], where the upcoming Data Act will set clearer rules on transfers of data generated by smart devices, the US has no real legislation governing what happens with your data once it reaches Apple's servers. Users are left with little way to verify those privacy promises. Maestro suggested that Apple could address these concerns by making it easier for people to conduct security research on smart device software. \"Allowing the development of alternative or modified software that can evaluate privacy settings could also increase user trust and better uphold Apple's public commitment to privacy,\" Maestro said. There are ways to limit the amount of data that advertisers can get from your Apple TV. But if you use the Apple TV app, Apple can use your activity to help make business decisions—and therefore money. As you might expect from a device that connects to the Internet and lets you stream shows and movies, Apple TV boxes aren't totally incapable of tracking you. But they're still the best recommendation for streaming users seeking hardware with more privacy and fewer ads.

    "title": "Tim Miller Dishes On the ‘X-Men’ Horror Movie He Almost Made",
    "article_text": "Slowly, but surely, Marvel’s making moves to bring theX-Men to the big screenagain in the next few years. As everyone waits to find out what all that entails (and who it’llinvolve), filmmakerTim Millerlooked back on the one he nearly did once upon a time. During a recent interview with theHollywood Reporter, theÂDeadpoolÂdirector talked about Marvel’s mutant corner as the company’s “secret weapon. […] The X-Men are my favorite characters, and I wrote to Kevin Feige like, ‘If there was anything you’d ever let me do in the Marvel universe, the X-Men would be it.'” In fact, he had an X-film in development at one point, which would’ve been based on Chris Claremont and John Byrne’sÂUncanny X-MenÂ#143. In that, the team departs the mansion for the holidays, leaving Kitty Pryde on her own. While left to her own devices, an N’Garaiâdemons the team previously fought over the yearsâinvades the mansion, and she’s got to hold her own against it. Miller described the film as“Home AlonemeetsAlien,” and itÂ seems this was theKitty solo movieFox announced back in 2018 that he would’ve directed from a script by comics scribeBrian Michael Bendis. (At the time, Kitty was part of the Guardians of the Galaxy as Star-Lord during Bendis and Valerio Schiti’s 2015-2017 run).ÂUnfortunately, this was in development at Fox around the time of its merger with Disney, so it was one of many ideasâalong with publicized solo films forGambitandMultiple Man, plus a hopefulFantastic Four crossoverâwhich never came to cinematic fruition. X-Men movies were typically action affairs, but Fox let the characters dip into horror withNew Mutants.It was the last franchise movie of the Fox era, but once they’ve properly settled into the MCU, maybe they can be taken for a scary spin again. Either way, Miller seems to be happy with how everything’s settled: he called himself “the luckiest nerd on the planet” for bringing a proper Deadpool to the silver screen, and feels things have gone up from there. “I didnât expect to have my own studio, or to doÂTerminator: Dark Fate,” he told THR. “Being able to doLove Death + RobotsÂ is probably my achievement Iâm most of. I’m old, but Iâm not done yet.” Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Mark Hamill’s Done with Luke Skywalker, and He Thinks ‘Star Wars’ Should Be, Too",
    "article_text": "Since the originalÂStar WarsÂback in 1977,Mark Hamillhas been a constant for the franchise alongside Original Trilogy costars Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. From gazing out longingly at the twin suns of Tattooine to rocking the Chanel boots and schooling his nephew in front of the First Order, audiences have watched him bring Luke Skywalker tomostly live-actionlife time and again. But now, Hamill thinks it’s time to officially move on. In a recent interview withComicBookfor his upcoming movieÂLife of Chuck,Âthe actor said he’s appreciative to George Lucas “letting me be a part of [Star Wars] back in the humble days when he called itÂ ‘the most expensive low-budget movie ever made.’ We never expected it to become a permanent franchise and a part of pop culture like that. But my deal is, I had my time.” (That, and with Luke dead as ofLast Jedi,Âhe has no desire to come back as a nude Force ghost.) Going forward, Hamill thinks the people in charge ofStar Warsshould “focus on the future and all the new characters.” He’s not wrong, but it’s a funny as hell time to say it, as it’s been atough askfor this franchise ever sinceForce Awakenscame out nearly a decade ago. (The actor has even been apart of thosecomplications!) And for all of Hollywood, well,Awakenspretty much wrote the book on legacy sequels that feature new, younger-generation characters hanging with returning elders, a formula that’s been copied inÂScream,Jurassic Park,Marvel (several times), and evenÂKarate Kid.

    "title": "‘MultiVersus’ Shows the Limits of IP Crossover Bonanzas",
    "article_text": "This weekend marks the end of a short, but strange era:ÂMultiVersus,Âa platform fighter featuring a bunch ofWarner Bros. characters, has shut down. The game was intended as a hopeful rival toÂSuper Smash Bros.,Âand after a promising start, WB has cut bait about a year after its full relaunch. ThatÂMultiVersusÂdied isn’t really a surprise these days; the mid-2020s have featured a wave of multiplayer games being shut down or losing support not long after they launch.Babylon’s Fall, Crossfire X, Gundam Evolution,and WB’s ownÂSuicide Squad: Kill the Justice LeagueÂare just a handful of examples. But depending on who you ask, Player First’s platform fighter had plenty of fingers to blame for its end. Some attribute it to the full game’smonetization, others the difference in how it played between its year-long open beta and its 1.0 release in 2024. Some think it all boiled down to the roster; WB owns aÂlotÂof IP, and clearly the aim was to get a selection of characters that would appeal to everyone. But that broadness means for every general A-lister like Batman or LeBron James (seriously), you’ve got what could generously be considered B or C-listers inÂGremlinsÂand supportingÂAdventure TimeÂcharacters. To those who’ve grown up with fighting games, Player First did the game a disservice without any other DC heavy hitters (your Flashes, Robins, etc.) or Cartoon Network kings like Ben 10, Gumball, and Dexter. There’s a certain degree of truth thereâno doubt people would’ve paid to become teenage Ben 10, shift to Rath and subsequently pummel Superman into the pavementâbut the bigger problem is the core concept ofMultiversusis no longer special. When crossovers first happened between IP, it tended to feel like a genuine surprise to see characters from different worlds hang out. Those born in the 90s probably have a special place in their heart for the likes ofJimmy/Timmy Power Hour,ÂKim Possible teaming with Lilo & Stitch and Billy and Mandy getting mixed up with the Kids Next Door. The best thing working in their favor was how rare they felt:ÂJimmy/TimmyÂwas an annualized trilogy, but these otherwise came and went before the shows got back to what they normally did. In the 2020s, that’s not really the case, as studios like WB and Disney want these meetings of the media to always feel big, attention-grabbing events that the surprise is lost. OfcourseÂ WB wants to bring the IP it owns together, it spent about half ofSpace Jam: A New LegacyÂstating as such with the subtlety of aÂRick & MortyÂepisode piledriving a bit into the ground. Before and duringÂMultiVersus’Âlife, we’ve seenBatmanandMarvelcross over withÂFortnite,Âhorror movie characters enterÂMortal Kombat,Âhunt monsters asAloyandGeralt of Rivia, and gotten into street fights as theTeenage Mutant Ninja TurtlesandOverwatchheroes. The last twoCall of DutyÂgames have added the Turtles,Squid GameÂsoldiers, WWE stars, andPaul Atreidesare post-launch DLC for players to pay money for. Many have, but there’s an equal amount of players who think the increasing array of IP skins borders on excessive and at worse, worsens the game. Activision’s reportedly taking amore restrainedapproach going forward, but suffice to say, players aren’t exactly hard up to see their favorite characters kill one another. LikeÂSuicide SquadÂbefore it,ÂMultiVersusÂwas ultimately a victim of WB chasing and trying to force its way into a space in the hopes of making money. It’s a shame Player First took the biggest hit of allâfollowing the game’s full launch, WB subsequently bought the studio, and it’s now closed alongside its game. Meanwhile, crossovers still persist: DC is about to letsome of its charactershang out with Marvel for the first time in 20 years, and Netherrealm will likely get some IP characters for its next project, which many are certain will beÂInjustice 3. In the same way the number must go up, the crossovers will persist until there’s no more worlds to collide. Want more io9 news?

    "article_text": "There’s a 104 days of summer vacation, but for some folks, school never really ends. At CCXP Mexico on Saturday, Prime Video unveiled its first look for season two ofGen V,Âthe college-focused spinoff forThe Boys, and the kids at Godolkin University have their work cut out for them. Set afterÂThe Boys’Âfourth season amid Homelander effectively ruling the United States, complete with Godolkin students leaving campus through specific checkpoints and forced to wear ID badges, Marie (Jaz Sinclair) and her friends are released from a rehabilitation center and allowed back at school. There, the new dean Cipher (Hamish Linklater) is looking to get students battle ready for a potential Supes/Human war. While the regular Supe kids are content to prepare and party, there’s division among Marie and her friends: some want to run and never look back, others want to stay and tear things apart from the inside. Too bad for them, those plans are interrupted by the discovery of a secret program from the school’s early days which may somehow link to Marie. Shortly before production on the new season began in spring 2024,Chance Perdromo(who played Andre, one of the kids imprisoned with Marie) died in a motorcycle crash. TheGen VÂteam later stated they wouldn’t recast Andre and instead tweaked the season around his passing, and his father Polarity (Sean Patrick Thomas) will be mourning (and later investigating) Andre’s passing. Also starring Derek Luh, Lizzie Broadway, London Thor, and Asa Germann, season two ofGen VÂkicks off September 17 with a three-episode premiere, followed by a single episode every week through October 22.

    "title": "’28 Years Later’ is Bringing New, Scarier Infected to the Party",
    "article_text": "Sony’sÂ28 Years LaterÂisn’t just reintroducing audiences to the series’devastating post-apocalypse, it’s also bringing some new horrors along for the ride. In an interview withIGN, director Danny Boyle teased the Infected have gained some new tricks since their last sighting in28 Weeks Later. Along with the typical, fast-running ones that’ve been all over the marketing, some have “mutated” to survive in this new environment. Hence, the “Slow-lows,” so named because they “hang about low level” and don’t do running of any sort. Despite their lack of speed Boyle “[doesn’t] advise messing with them.” If you’ve played video games with zombies, you know it’s never just one variant lurking around. Along with the Slow-lows,28 Years LaterÂwill introduce Beserker and Alpha types which are stronger than the regular Infected and might have some intelligence buried within their Rage Virus-addled minds. On a technical level, Boyle said the team generally shot the Infected “in a brittle, almost unreliable way” similar to how they handled the first film. But the new undead get some additional flourishes, like Slow-low actors have cameras attached to them to enhance audience fear, or some sequences with specific Infected requiring 20 iPhones to simultaneously record in order to create “a poor man’s bullet time.” The new Infected also lend themselves to28 Years’photography. For you format sickos, Boyle also toldIGNthe film was shot on widescreen to replicate the first movie’s “unease…the speed and the velocity, the visceral [aspect] of the way the infected were depicted. If you’re on a widescreen format, they could be anywhereâ¦ you have to keep scanning, looking around for them, really.” 28 Years LaterÂhits theaters on June 20. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Stop Using, Start Itching: FDA Flags Risk Tied to Popular Allergy Med Zyrtec",
    "article_text": "Two common anti-allergy medications can leave you feeling scratchier than ever. The Food and Drug Administration is warning that stopping long-term use of cetirizine and levocetirizine can, in rare cases, cause intense itchiness. The FDAissuedits warning earlier this month. Over the past decade, the agency has received hundreds of reports of people experiencing severeâsometimes “debilitating”âitching after going off the medications. Though it appears to be a rare complication, the FDA is alsorequiringmanufacturers to mention the side effect in the labeling of these drugs. “The underlying mechanism for this risk is unknown, but our evaluation supports a causal relationship between stopping cetirizine or levocetirizine and pruritus,” the FDAstatedin its Drug Safety Communication about the products. Antihistamines Could Help Some Long Covid Patients, New Research Suggests Cetirizine and levocetirizine are both antihistamine drugs that have been around for a while. The former was first approved as the prescription drug Zyrtec in 1995, while levocetirizine was approved as Xyzal in 2007. Though the drugs can still be prescribed, they’re also now widely available over-the-counter to treat hay fever and other allergy symptoms. As useful and safe as these drugs have been for millions of people, whispers of this side effect have been circulating for years. A 2019 studyidentifiedpotential cases of severe pruritus (itching) related to cetirizine withdrawal dating back to at least 2008, for instance, while a 2016 studyreportedsimilar cases in the Netherlands tied to levocetirizine; users have alsodetailedtheir unbearable experiences trying to quit these drugs on Reddit and other social media platforms long before the FDA stepped in. While it’s possible some people may have had a return of allergy symptoms once they stopped taking these drugs, people commonly reported itching that hadn’t existed before or to a degree previously never experienced. A Young Man Became Allergic to Orgasmsâbut There’s a Happy Ending The FDA identified 209 cases worldwide (197 in the U.S.) of new-onset pruritus after cetirizine/levocetirizine withdrawal between April 2017 and July 2023. Most people had taken the medications for over three months, often years, though cases could also occur after only one month of continuous use. Sufferers typically complained of widespread itching that required medical intervention; in some cases, the itching was so severe that it left people bedridden or even led to thoughts of suicide or self-harm. The silver lining is that this side effect seems to be rare overall. The FDA notes that about 100 million prescriptions or OTC purchases of both drugs combined were made in 2022. People with the side effect aren’t necessarily doomed to itch forever, either. The FDA found that 90% of people who restarted their medication resolved their itching, for instance, and about one-third of people were able to avoid a new bout of itching if they slowly weaned off the drug once restarting. Some people have also reported relief after taking a short course of corticosteroids. Still, if you’re a longtime user of these drugs, this is certainly something to be aware of in case you ever decide to stop. People planning to take these drugs long term should also discuss the benefits and risks of doing so with their doctor, the FDA said, “who can provide advice based on your personal needs.” Allergiesantihistaminesside effects Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Oppo Find X8 Ultra Review: This Might Be the World’s Best Phone Camera",
    "article_text": "I get itâthe smartphone market is boring.GalaxyafteriPhoneafterPixel, year after year after yearâat least if youâre in the U.S. Even if youâre into phone tech, it can be hard to feel enthusiastic about the prospect of annual upgrades. In Asia, however, the battle for smartphone supremacy is as brutal as ever. Chinese companies like Huawei, Vivo, and Xiaomi are still locked into breakneck competition, releasing multiple devices a year that put Western offerings to shameâat least on paper. The Oppo Find X8 Ultra is one of the strongest recent examples. Itâs an all-around flagship phone that crams the very best of high-end specs into a sleek form factor. All things considered, I think itâs the best camera phone available anywhere in the world. Oppo Find X8 Ultra Oppoâs latest flagship Find X8 Ultra has everything you could possibly want from a phoneâexcept availability outside of China. Pros Cons Itâs not exactly aSamsung Galaxy S25 Edge, but Oppoâs stated goal with the Find X8 Ultraâs design was to pull off âthe thinnest camera phone.â At 8.78mm thick compared to its 9.5mm-thick predecessor, the Find X7 Ultra, Oppo has indeed slimmed the Find X8 Ultra down beyond any of its cutting-edge competitors. But because of its boxy, squared-off design, it doesnât necessarily seem that much thinner in the hand. This yearâsXiaomi 15 Ultra, for example, is 9.48mm thick but has tapered edges that donât dig into your palms as much. Thatâs not to say the Find X8 Ultra is unwieldy. Oppo has basically achieved what it set out to here; it essentially feels like a very slightly thickeriPhone 16 Pro Max, which is a strong achievement considering the hardware. But the design is extremely straightforward and austere, which may or may not be to your taste. Oddly, the Find X8 Ultra looks near-identical to the base Find X8, while the mid-tier Find X8 Pro is sleeker and flashier than both. The display is as good as youâll find on any premium phone. Itâs a 6.82-inch flat-sided OLED panel with a variable refresh rate (1 to 120Hz) and 1440p resolution. The Find X8 Ultra gets up to 1,600 nits bright in regular outdoor usage and peaks at 2,500 nits with HDR content. The bezels are equally slim on all four sides. It has Dolby Vision support and, more unusually, Oppoâs Splash Touch technology to limit unwanted inputs when itâs wet. I did make a point of testing this in a hot tub, for science, and the phone really does actually stay more or less usable even when itâs covered in drops of water. Iâll also mention the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, not just for its speed improvements over the X7 Ultraâs optical reader, but for how Oppo improved the way you set it upânow you can register your thumb by just rolling it in a circle a few times rather than tapping the sensor repeatedly with every part of the tip. Not the biggest deal in the world, but a welcome improvement if youâre a weirdo like me who goes through that process dozens of times a year when testing new phones. Another design quirk is Oppoâs shift away from a mute slider switch, a popular differentiating feature on phones from its subsidiary OnePlus. There’s now a customizable button on the top left of the phone called the Shortcut Button, and yes, it works more or less identically to the iPhoneâs Action Buttonâright down to the full-screen UI that pops up when you choose its function. Iâm fine with the hardware change, but the implementation is a little brazen. Elsewhere, the Find X8 Ultraâs spec sheet includes what youâd expect from the top shelf of Android flagships in 2025. The processor is aQualcomm Snapdragon 8 Eliteand the phone can be outfitted with up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. (The base model has 12GB and 256GB, respectively.) This is Oppoâs first Ultra-class phone to include silicon-carbon battery technology, following its debut in the X8 Pro and a subsequent appearance in thefolding Find N3. Basically, this allows Oppo to get a lot more capacity out of a smaller physical spaceâdespite its slimmer frame, the Find X8 Ultraâs battery weighs in at 6,100mAh versus 5,000mAh on the X7 Ultra. As for charging, Oppoâs own 100W SuperVOOC adapter can get you from zero to 100 percent in under 40 minutes, which is impressive considering the increased capacity of the battery. The Find X8 Ultra also supports wireless charging at up to 50W with a compatible proprietary charger. Between the fast charging and the large battery capacity, Iâve found the phone unlikely to die on me in regular use. Iâm not going to say itâll never happen on a long day of shooting in the sun, but itâs been as solid as any comparable phone I could name. That brings me to the camera system, whichâas ever with âUltraâ-class Chinese flagshipsâis the main point of differentiation here. The Find X8 Ultra doesnât necessarily have the best hardware in every single category, but thereâs a strong case to be made that itâs the most well-rounded and versatile camera system around. The Find X8 Ultra’s primary camera uses a 1-inch-type sensor, which is the class-leading standard for Chinese flagship phones; it’s the same size as what you’ll find onSony’s RX100 range of point-and-shoot camerasorFujifilmâs new X half. What this means in practice is that the lens you use the most gives you far more depth and dynamic range than what you get from an iPhone or Galaxy. The light-gathering ability is simply on another level, and you’re able to separate subjects through shallow bokeh (background blur) without resorting to portrait mode, which often still shows imperfections between the foreground and background. The Find X8 Ultra’s telephoto lensesâyes, there are twoâare also a particular strength. The 3x periscope camera has an unusually large 1/1.56-inch sensor paired to an f/2.1 lens with close-focus ability, allowing for excellent mid-range and macro shots with natural shallow depth of field. There’s also a 6x f/3.1 lens with a 1/1.95-inch sensor. The one drawback is the 1/2.75-inch ultra-wide camera, which isnât necessarily weak next to the competition but does feel like a compromise in the name of thinness; previous Oppo flagships performed much better. Oppo has also adopted a thoughtful approach to camera software. The regular photo mode turns out pictures along the lines of what you’d expect from a high-end smartphone, with crunchy sharpness and HDR detail preserved in every shot. I think Oppo has the best color science in that sense, which is why phones like the Find N3 can outperform their hardware. But if you’re not into the typical smartphone photo lookâwhich I personally am notâyou can swipe on over to the Hasselblad-branded Master mode, which gives you much more natural results right out of the box. While Master mode is fully customizable, its default settings tend to line up with what I’d be aiming for when editing files from a dedicated camera. This year, Oppoâs image processing is aided by what the company calls a âTrue Chroma Camera,â a low-res sensor dedicated to capturing accurate color information across the frame for better automatic white balance. Itâs difficult to test exactly how the camera system would work without this additional hardware, but I did see impressive results in challenging situations like low-light portraits. The shooting experience is also helped by the âQuick Button,â which is pretty much a facsimile for Appleâs Camera Control. It gives quick access to the camera app and shutter release, but itâs fully capacitive and much easier to press; I found myself using it a lot more often than I do on my own iPhone 16 Pro. The Find X8 Ultra has a vastly more capable camera system than you can get on any smartphone sold in the US, and it trades blows with the best available from domestic competitors like Xiaomi and Vivo. That said, I canât really recommend anyone go out of their way to buy it unless theyâre based in China. I have personally found it to work well on my NTT Docomo SIM card in Japan, but I canât speak to bands or coverage wherever you might be reading this. Oppoâs China-focused version of ColorOS is pretty usable and comes with built-in compatibility for Google Mobile Services through a settings toggle, meaning you can use the Play Store and Google apps along with any third-party software that relies on Googleâs APIs. Still, an uninitiated Western user might feel blindsided by a bunch of Chinese bloatware and services they wonât ever be able to use. The Find X8 Ultraâs eSIM support is only accessible through the built-in ORoaming app, for example, and you can only pay for data through WeChat or AliPay. But the bigger picture here is that the Find X8 Ultra demonstrates how Chinese phone makers are simply miles ahead of whatâs available in the U.S. and Europe. Whether youâre shopping for a Galaxy, Pixel, or iPhone this year, youâre getting a raw deal when it comes to pure hardware capability and camera performance. This phone launched at 6,499 yuan in China, which works out to around $900. Given the present political climate, it seems less likely than ever that Chinese OEMs will find a way to sell their highest-end devices in the U.S. Thatâs unfortunate for anyone interested in the best hardware available. The Oppo Find X8 Ultra will be my go-to camera phone until something better comes along, and I have a feeling that that something wonât be available in the U.S. either. Itâs not like this particular phone necessarily changes the gameâChinese companies have been leapfrogging Apple and Samsung for years. All in all, the Find X8 Ultra is an awesome phone thatâs as good an example as any of whatâs capable today with modern mobile technology. I think itâs clearly better than anything Apple, Samsung, or Google are selling in the U.S. today. Does that mean you should import it? Probably not. But it does mean you should raise your standards for the next time those companies try to sell you on new hardware.

    "title": "5,000-Year-Old Bread Recipe Recreated in Turkey—and Locals Can’t Get Enough",
    "article_text": "Scientists have discovered an ancient bread recipe in Turkeyâand now the local bakery that recreated it canât keep up with demand. Some 5,000 years ago, someone buried a piece of charred bread beneath the threshold of a house in what is now Eskisehir in central Turkey. Archaeologists unearthed it in September 2024 during an excavation at Kulluoba Hoyuk, a Bronze Age settlement that has been under investigation for decades.Â The remarkably preserved bread has been on display at the EskiÅehir Archaeological Museum since March 28. “This is the oldest baked bread to have come to light during an excavation, and it has largely preserved its shape,” said Murat Turkteki, archaeologist and director of the excavation, in aninterviewÂ with AFP. Analysis revealed that the bread was made from coarsely ground emmer flourâan ancient wheat varietyâalong with lentil seeds and a plant leaf used as a natural leavening agent. Flat like a pancake and disc-shaped, the bread measures about 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) in diameter. Curious to see if the recipe could be recreated, local officials contacted Halk Ekmek, a bakery in Eskisehir.Â Since ancient emmer seeds are no longer available in Turkey, the bakers used Kavilca wheatâa closely related varietyâalong with bulgur and lentils to approximate the original ingredients. And apparently, it’s delicious. The first batch sold out within hours, and the bakery has been selling around 300 loaves of âKulluoba breadâ daily ever since. With municipal subsidies, the bread is sold for just 50 Turkish lira (about $1.30). Another compelling aspect of the bread is that it’s made from drought-resistant crops. This has caught the attention of both archaeologists and local officials. Turkey currently cultivates water-intensive crops like corn and sunflowers, but Kavilca wheat is resistant to both drought and disease. âOur ancestors are teaching us a lesson.

    "title": "The Galaxy S25+ Is so Cheap on Amazon (All-Time Low) That Samsung Blocks Its Price From Public View",
    "article_text": "This article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. If you’ve recently searched for the Samsung Galaxy S25+ 512GB on Amazon, you might have come across something peculiar: the price is not visible. Rather it states“price hidden”until you put it in your cart. This is because of an agreement with Samsung: The manufacturer is wanting to keep price drops like this a secret – especially as it was released just a few months ago. On Amazon, the Galaxy S25+ 512GB is on sale at its lowest point to date for a limited time only: The512GB model can be purchased for $869 which is 22% off the original list price of $1119. It’s obviously also a lot cheaper than if you get it from the official Samsung store. Make sure you grab yours before it runs out of stock! See at Amazon Launched at the start of 2025, the Galaxy S25+ is a more powerful phone than the regular S25 with extra features to match. Both phones have the same basics: unlocked Android, smart AI cameras, and Samsungâs latest ProScaler display. But the S25+ adds more upgrades, which makes the higher price so much worthwhile. On top of that, with the current discount, le S25+ is more affordable than the standard S25. If you’re looking for differences, the Galaxy S25 has a smaller 6.2-inch FHD+ display and starts with 128GB or 256GB of storage while the S25+ offers a larger 6.7-inch QHD+ screen and storage options of 256GB or 512GB (which is the one on sale right now). The S25+ also benefits from a higher pixel density, which makes images and text appear sharper. Beyond display and storage, the Galaxy S25+ stands out with a bigger battery (4,900mAh compared to the S25âs 4,000mAh) for longer battery life for heavy users. The S25+ also supports ultra-wideband connectivity which is not available on the standard S25 and enables features like precise device tracking and secure digital car keys. The best part of this Amazon deal is that the Galaxy S25+ 512GB now costs less than many standard S25 models, thanks to Amazonâs limited-time sale. Itâs hard to find a better price for a top phone with all the newest features. The S25+ is unlocked, so you can use it with any carrier, and it comes with a one-year warranty for extra peace of mind. Just keep in mind thatyou will need to add it to your cart to see the real price: Samsung is not allowing Amazon to disclose the full discount of the price in public.

    "title": "Solar Storms Are Pushing Elon Musk’s Satellites Back to Earth",
    "article_text": "New research suggests thatheightened solar activity shortens the lifespans of SpaceXâs Starlink satellites, and may send them careening back to Earth at greater velocities. Perhaps unintuitively, this could increase the risk of satellite debris making landfall.Â This preprint study, which has yet to undergo peer review, adds to a wealth of evidence showing thatsolar storms wreak havoc on Elon Muskâs Starlinks. Over the last several years, the frequency and intensity of these storms have increased as the Sun approaches solar maximumâthe peak in its 11-year cycle. At the same time, the number of satellites orbiting Earth has skyrocketed,largely due to the rise of private megaconstellations like Starlink.Â Solar Maximum Is Officially Here: Brace for More Stormy Space Weather and Epic Auroras A team of researchers led by Denny Oliveira from NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center tracked reentries of Starlink satellites between 2020 and 2024. This period coincided with the rising phase of the current solar cycle, when solar activity ramps up ahead of the solar maximum, which occurred in October 2024. Over the course of those five years, 523 Starlink satellites reentered Earth’s atmosphere. Oliveira and his colleagues analyzed the orbits of these satellites using a statistical technique that identifies patterns in how their rates of orbital decay and reentry change during periods of high solar activity. The researchers found that geomagnetic activityâdisturbances in the upper atmosphere triggered by solar eruptionsâcauses Starlinks to reenter Earthâs atmosphere sooner than expected. These satellites aredesignedto remain in orbit for roughly five years. But during bouts of severe geomagnetic storms, their lifespans may be reduced by 10 to 12 days, Oliveira told Gizmodo.Â He and his colleagues believe this happens because geomagnetic activity heats the atmosphere and causes it to expand. This increases drag on satellites, shortening their lifespans and causing them to lose altitude more quickly as they interact with the upper atmosphere. What’s more, atmospheric drag may increase the chances of satellite-on-satellite collisions, as the orbital models that guide collision avoidance measures don’t fully account for the effects of geomagnetic activity. The teamâs findings are currently available on the preprint serverarXiv.Â Â A difference of 10 to 12 days may not sound like a big deal, but it could make it nearly impossible for SpaceX to ensure that Starlink satellites return to Earth via controlled reentry, Oliveira explained. What’s more, his analysis shows that increased drag causes satellites to reenter at higher velocities, which he believes could raise the chances of debris reaching the ground. This may seem counterintuitive, since increasing the velocity of an object during reentry generally increases the likelihood of total disintegration. But Oliveira posits that Starlinks falling at greater speeds may have a better chance of surviving reentry due to reduced atmospheric interaction. Further research will need to confirm this hypothesis, as the study did not directly assess debris risks. Starlinks are designed to fully burn up during reentry, but that doesnât always happen. In 2024, a 5.5-pound (2.5-kilogram) chunk of Starlink debris made landfall on a farm in Saskatchewan, New Scientistreported. In February of this year, SpaceXsaidit is possible for Starlink debris fragments to fall back to Earth, but claimed that this poses âno risk to humans on the ground, at sea, or in the air.â There are now more than 7,500 Starlinks in orbit, according to Harvard University astronomer Jonathan McDowell, whotracksthe constellation. Eventually, SpaceX hopes to quintuple the size of this fleet, with a goal of launching 42,000 Starlinks in total, according toSpace.com. This is in addition to the thousands of other satellites currently orbiting Earth.Â â[This is] the first time ever in history that we have so many satellites in orbit at the same time,â Oliveira said. âSo, now, we have satellites reentering pretty much every week. And possibly, in the next months or years, every day.â Understanding how changes in solar activity impact their lifespans and their reentries will be critical as Earthâs orbit becomes increasingly crowded. geomagnetic stormssolar maximumSPACEXStarlink Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "How to Watch the F1 Spanish Grand Prix 2025 on a Free Channel",
    "article_text": "This article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. Can you believe it’s already June? It sounds almost as unbelievable as Piastri’s third place at the last GP! Will he be able to bounce back? Thatâs a question weâll soon answer, with the F1 Spanish GP available on a free channel. You donât have to spend a fortune to watch some heart-pounding Formula 1 races. As youâll see, thereâs a convenient free channel that broadcasts the Spanish Grand Prix without requiring an account. Weâll explain how to access it in just a moment. Have you heard of SRF? SRF is a Swiss-based TV channel with an online streaming platform called SRF Play. SRF Playis an on-demand service that allows you to stream the F1 Spanish GP live for free. It doesn’t need a subscription. Users alsodon’t need to make an accountto watch it. SRF broadcasts the race on June 1st inFull HD but with Swiss commentary(and the qualifying the day before). It’s also worth mentioning that the majority of SRF’s content is region-locked. Thus, only people in Switzerland or with aSwiss IP addresscan access it. If you’re traveling to Lucerne, Zurich, or Lugano, good for you. But, if you’re enjoying the comfort of your home, you’re not lost. There’s a clever solution to this problem that people smarter than us have discovered long ago. Get a Swiss IP address with NordVPN People online have been using VPNs to counteract geo-blocks. VPNs havepaved the way for F1 fans to watch pretty much all races for free. NordVPN, which stands out from the crowd, is a popular pick, as it offers countless Swiss servers with 10 Gbps ports and unlimited data for streaming. Additionally, it provides modern protocols that emphasize speed. This is essential for not missing a single moment of the race.NordVPN works on all devices, so watching the Spanish Grand Prix online for free is possible on the fly. Moreover, it’s very easy to install and use, making it perfect for beginners. The solution revolves aroundconnecting to a VPN server in Switzerlandand obtaining a Swiss IP address. That’s virtually all you have to do. Once you’re on SRF,it’ll detect your Swiss IP and unblock its content for you, including the Spanish Grand Prix free live stream. Keep in mind that NordVPN isn’t free, but many people “make” it free. They leverage its30-day money-back guaranteefor new accounts. This way, they watch the desired race, quit the VPN, andsnatch a full refundafter the fact. Yes, it’s accessible on F1 TV, but not every subscription tier allows you to watch it live. The F1 TV Access plan is the one to avoid, as it only provides delayed race replays, some F1 documentaries, and radio recaps. The F1 TV Pro plan is better because it includes all live streams of Formula 1 races without ads and on-demand. Just be mindful of its price which usually stands at$64.99/year in most countries. The last tier is F1 TV Premium. It enables Multiview and 4K Ultra HD streaming on up to 6 devices at a time. Given the price of $89.99/year, it’s the priciest, so only the most fiery fans will splurge their money on it. One more thing â it’s not available in every country. Some people use a VPNto access it, others do the same for other free channels. Here’s the full schedule of this weekend’s Grand Prix: The main race is on June 1st, while the event begins on May 30th with the first practice. You’ll be able to watch three free practice sessions and the qualifying, which takes place the day before, on May 31st. Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya spans 4,657 kilometers, includes 66 laps, and the entire race distance is 307,236 kilometers. The fastest-ever lap was driven by Max Verstappen in 2023, clocking at 1:16.330. Try NordVPN risk-free today Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Apple is reportedly creating its own Steam-like game launcher, but it's still missing the key to making gaming on Mac great",
    "article_text": "Apple is creating its own game launcher, but what it really needs is a page from Valve's book. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Apple's 2025 Worldwide Developers Conference, or WWDC,is just a couple weeks away. Like every year previous, it sounds like Apple is going to squeeze gaming into its software announcements. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple is planning to unveil a \"dedicated gaming app\" that \"will serve as a launcher for titles and centralize in-game achievements, leaderboards, communications and other activity.\" That sounds a lot like Steam, only this app will feature games from the App Store and, of course, the Apple Arcade subscription service. However, Gurman also mentioned that the Mac version \"can tap into games downloaded outside of the App Store,\" so maybe it will connect to your Steam or Epic Games library somehow. Apple alsorecently purchased RAC7, the studio behind Sneaky Sasquatch, which might hint that they're planning to do some in-house game development. The past few years have also seen a handful of prominent games get ported to Apple's platforms, like Assassin's Creed Mirage and Resident Evil 4, and Netflix Gaming has made some admirable progress bringing over indie games like Hades and Death's Door. While all of that is a step in the right direction, most gamers are still opting for a Windows PC or a console to play anything beyond mobile games. A new game launcher for Apple devices will probably make it more convenient finding and managing games on your Mac or iPhone, but it doesn't address the underlying issue of game compatibility. Unfortunately for Apple, right now gaming on Linux is a better experience than gaming on Mac, which is really saying something. One has to wonder why Apple doesn't take a page from Valve's book and develop a compatibility layer for macOS like Valve's Proton platform, which has brought hundreds of Windows games to Linux. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. A compatibility layer would reduce the hassle for developers to bring their games to Apple devices, or at least to macOS, and create a path to quickly grow the player base on macOS. Right now, Apple has to work against the Catch-22 of no players vs no game developers: game devs aren't creating games for Mac because gamers are overwhelmingly playing on Windows, andthatwon't change until there are more games on Mac. Ironically, MacBooks have gotten a lot better for gaming since Apple launched its M-series chips. The issue is that there aren't very many games compatible with macOS to really take advantage of that hardware. Some sort of Proton-like compatibility layer, which could be built into Apple's new launcher, seems like the perfect way to bridge that gap and show how good gaming on macOS can be, potentially leading more devs to offer native Mac support. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Stevie Bonifield is a freelance tech journalist specializing in mobile tech, gaming gear, and accessories.

In a new video abouthidden or poorly explained Elden Ring Nightreign character mechanics, FromSoft LoreTuber-in-Chief VaatiVidya revealed that the new game'sdefault, John DarkSouls character, Wylder, actually has some fighting game-worthy combos and movement tech. The tricks were first outlined months ago during Nightreign's network test by userOnslaughtCasualty42on theFromSoftwaresubreddit. In the delightfully named \"A Dogshit Guide to Make Wylder Fly,\" OnslaughtCasualty42 outlines how Wylder's ultimate ability with the Guts arm cannon has some surprising interactions and combos with his jump and grappling hook. The marquee one, shown off by Vaati, is to pull yourself forward with the grapple, do a 180° turn, and fire off the ultimate to launch yourself even farther forward like a Quake rocket jump. It reminds me most of the kind of wild movement tech and offstage recovery combos you see in Super Smash Bros. Melee, like theReverse Temple Jump. It honestly has pretty limited utility in actual Nightreign gameplay though: Maybe to clear a chasm quickly with no spirit spring around, get to the top of a fort from a nearby mountain, or quickly escape the danger zone as the circle closes in. But who cares⁠—it's rad as hell. Nightreign gets most things right and a few things bafflingly, disastrously wrong, but its roster of Souls dudes is unimpeachably excellent. They look sick, feel fun to play, and it's starting to become apparent that they all have crazy-high fighting game skill ceilings with movement tech and hidden mechanics galore. My favorite remainsJohnny Katanas, the Executor, whose slow-moving Sekiro deflect stance demands that you learn when it's time to tank, and when you should be DPSing.

    "article_text": "Two of People Can Fly's planned mystery games may never see the light of day. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Sebastian Wojciechowski, People Can Fly CEO, shared some disheartening news inan announcement on LinkedInon Sunday. Not only is the studio indefinitely suspending two games it had in development, it is also scaling down its staff. Both are the result of negotiations with a publisher falling through and a lack of adequate resources and funding to continue the projects, codenamed Gemini and Bifrost. As Wojciechowski detailed in the announcement, \"The suspension of the Gemini project is a consequence of the fact that the Publisher has not presented us with a draft of the subsequent content rider to the Publishing Agreement covering the terms and conditions of further milestones on project Gemini and the lack of communication from the Publisher as to its willingness to continue or terminate the Gemini project.\" \"Project Bifrost was suspended due to the above and the analysis of the Group's cash flow, which showed a lack of prospects for securing organizational resources and funds necessary to continue the production and release of this project.\" That's a mouthful, but in layman's terms: Wojciechowski is seriously laying into Gemini's unnamed publisher, claiming that it just left People Can Fly on read for long enough that they have to cancel the project. The knock-on financial effect means the studio can't keep going with Bifrost either. To make matters worse, with both games indefinitely on hold, People Can Fly has to \"scale down\" its teams, meaning some of the studio's staff are losing their jobs. Wojciechowski concluded his statement on a somber note, saying, \"We wish to express our deepest regret and sadness over how these events have unfolded and our sincere gratitude for everyone's contribution up to this point.\" The announcement does not mention exactly how many people will be laid off or if People Can Fly wants to leave the door open to return to projects Gemini and Bifrost⁠—but the prognosis isn't good. \"Gemini\" and \"Bifrost\" are the code names of games that haven't been officially revealed yet, but after this news, it looks like we might not ever find out what those games were supposed to be. People Can Fly still has a ton of projects still in development, though. It's been announced that the studio will be co-developing the upcoming Gears of War prequel, E-Day, alongside The Coalition, and they are also working on the co-op survival shooter,Lost Rift.

    "article_text": "Elden Ring Nightreign was designed to look like more than just a spin-off. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. You might not have much time to take in the atmosphere inElden Ring Nightreignwhile you're speedrunning between boss fights, but more attention and detail was put into the world design than you might expect for a spin-off game that reuses so many assets from the 2022 hit. FromSoftwareEnvironmental Artist Saori Mizuno dug into those details ina recent interview with IGN, where she revealed all the considerations that went into creating Limveld, as well as where she and her team drew inspiration from. As its name suggests, Nightreign takes the bulk of its inspiration fromElden Ring, but the designers tried to put a fresh spin on a world that's already deeply familiar to many players. Mizuno explained, \"We didn't want to make it feel too different from Elden Ring, as it used that as a base for the design and the setting. One specific direction [we] did get early on was to create something that at first feels and looks familiar and gradually transforms into the unfamiliar and into the unknown.\" To do that, they leaned into the game's themes of light and dark, day and night. Like Elden Ring, Nightreign's environments are beautiful, albeit in a sort of moody, haunting way. The designers used the looming threat of the oncoming night to amp up that haunting tone. \"Even when designing Limveld, that initial environment on the first day, I wanted it to feel beautiful, like from an outward glance, that looks beautiful and inviting, but pretty quickly you feel like something's off or something's not quite right,\" Mizuno said. \"We wanted players to begin to almost yearn for the night, and sort of look forward to this encroaching darkness.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Mizuno said she was also inspired by the Studio Ghibli film Spirited Away, which she says brought \"this feeling of being unable to go home, unable to escape from a dream, this sort of feeling I wanted to kind of harness while designing these worlds and tried to get that through to the player.\" Like Spirited Away, Nightreign also has moments of calm and safety that contrast with the more sinister outside world, specifically in the Round Table Hold, which was brought over from Elden Ring with some tweaks. Mizuno said this hub and rest area took inspiration from Dark Souls, explaining, \"We wanted it to feel, from a design perspective, more cozy, more welcoming, more at home. One inspiration was the Firelink Shrine from Dark Souls 1, where you feel sort of more embraced by the atmosphere, you feel like you're coming home after these hardships, after a hard-fought battle.\" 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together The battles in Nightreign definitely are \"hard-fought,\" if nothing else. As much as the high level of difficulty in Nightreign can leave me frustrated, I can't help but enjoy being in the world of Limveld. One of my first comments after jumping into the game was that I wished I had more time to explore and just take in everything. Nightreign isn't in the business of giving you more time foranything, though, but maybe that's just another reason to keep coming back to it so you can see everything Limveld has to offer (and everything waiting to kill your team).

Here's a breakdown of all the tips and notes I have: Your reward for all that is… fine. Honestly, the Fell Omen Fetish is more interesting than genuinely useful, but it's a pretty good option until you unlock some of thereally strong relicsby beating Nightlords and Remembrances. It gives you: The only one of those that really stands out to me for potential buildcrafting is the weapon swap damage bonus: It's pretty quick and easy to swap the weapon in one of your hands for a quick boost every few seconds. I'm also curious if Executor's character skill where he pulls out the deflect katana counts as a swap for the relic's purposes⁠—that would make it quite good on him, since he's always switching between the cursed blade and his normal weapons. Really though, I just like this as another sneaky surprise from Nightreign. It's a nice encapsulation of theentire experience ofbeing Nightreigned, in fact: Obtuse frustration, followed by a delightful surprise that just puts a smile on your face.

    "title": "I didn't even know what roleplaying was until I experienced this bizarre '90s B-game where you slowly turn into a bug",
    "article_text": "Bitten by the bug. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Here's a question. What's the most important game in your life you don't think anybody else would mention as having a significant influence on theirs? To be clear, I don't mean the most obscure game you've ever played, although there's a chance it might be that. I'm referring to the most unusual game you've crossed paths with that had a noticeable impact on your existence. For me, that game is Entomorph: Plague of the Darkfall. Released in 1995, Entomorph is a top-down, Ultima-coded RPG developed by the long-defunct Cyberlore Studios. It puts you in the role of a hero named Squire Warwick stuck in a fantasy world overrun by giant insects, with the gimmick that Warwick transforms into a giant insect over the course of his adventure. I'm not sure exactly how well known Entomorph is, though I'm confident if you asked any random person to list 100 RPGs, Entomorph wouldn't feature. For me, though, Entomorph is an incredibly important game. Not only is it the first RPG I ever played, I didn't even know what an RPG was until I played it. As a kid, my family were fairly ahead of the curve with PCs. My dad was always intrigued by computers and the Internet, albeit mainly as tools, while my uncle was obsessed with both PCs and PC gaming—particularly first-person shooters. When it came to tabletop games, though, we were staunch traditionalists. Chess. Monopoly. Cluedo. Connect 4. Our shelves were filled with games that would make any tabletop enthusiast implode through boredom. Needless to say, tabletop RPGs were unheard of, and I didn't encounter a dungeon or a dragon until around ten or eleven years old. Then, out of nowhere, dad randomly gave me and my brother a copy ofFirst Quest, a D&D starter set. He never explained why he bought it, or what it was. To be honest, I don't think he fully understood what it was. I think he just recognised the name and figured it might be something we'd enjoy. Now, First Quest is specifically designed to introduce players to RPGs. But when the most conceptually adventurous board game you've ever played is Mousetrap, the idea of a game where youmake up what happenscan be difficult to grasp. I tried to read the manual, but it might as well have been a book on particle physics. Nonetheless, I figured it couldn't bethatdifferent from the other board games I'd played. It came with figurines and dice (alotof dice) and a grid-based paper dungeon that resembled a board. Which is how my brother and I ended up trying to play Dungeons and Dragons as a roll and move game. Youcouldargue thiswas the first RPG I played, but I can imagine the look of horror on a D&D diehard's face at the prospect of someone rolling a D20 and thenmoving twenty squares, so I think we can all agree that this doesn't count. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Anyway, sometime after this, I got my own PC, assembled from the leftover parts from my dad and uncle's computers after they upgraded. I had a few new games for it, like Tomb Raider 2, Quake, and uh, a digital version of the boardgame Battleships. But I also had a couple ofMegapaks, compilations of 10 or so PC games, typically (though not always) B-tier games from the previous year. Entomorph was included onMegpak 5, alongside games like Flight Unlimited, Terminal Velocity, and the original Jagged Alliance. I can't remember what drew me to Entomorph, but I probably just tried it because I had it. What I do recall, though, is being baffledby it. Unlike the First Quest fiasco, I'd argue Entomorph was equally to blame here. Entomorph is a deeply weirdgame, essentially Ultima by way of David Cronenberg. The first thing that happens in Entomorph is your character gets lectured at by a giant spider that controls time, which then teleports you to a desolate island dotted with ruined wooden huts and littered with corpses. When you walk into the nearest hut, you're immediately attacked by two zombie-like creatures wrapped in bandages. When you punch them to death, theyburstin a giant pool of blood and bones. Frankly, it was probably that which led me to stick with Entomorph. Having just had my mind opened to the concept of \"gibs\" by Quake, I was fascinated by games that depicted gore. So any game that let me explode a man with my fists was going to grab my attention. Even so, I distinctly recall how difficult it was to get to grips with Entomorph. Every game I'd played up to that point was linear, whereas Entomorph let you explore its maps freely. The idea of going where you wanted in a game was surprisingly intimidating, especially when there are no explicit pointers regarding what you're supposed to do. Moreover, I can't emphasise enough what a peculiar vibe the game has, especially in the opening section. The goal of the tutorial is to resurrect a shaman from the dead, which you do by soaking up the blood of a mosquito from a sea sponge and squirting it on the shaman's desiccated corpse. When the shaman arises, he summons a giant octopus god out of the sea. His job done, the undead shaman promptly explodes as a man cries \"We are saved!\". It's a moment that has been seared in my brain for the best part of three decades. Prior to writing this, I hadn't played Entomorph since my original encounter with it. But it's readily available onGOG, so I decided to risk ruining my memories of it and downloaded it. The GoG version is not particularly well optimised for modern machines, but it does run. Playing it now, Entomorph is much simpler than I remember it, almost as much of an adventure puzzler as it is an actual role-playing game. Perhaps, counterintuitively, this made it an ideal first RPG, challenging enough to expand my horizons, but with a scope that I could ultimately grasp. Some might argue that a 2D Zelda game might have offered the same thing with a more suitable tone. I'd argue that exposure to exploding undead corpses is just what a healthy growing boy needs. Crucially, Entomorph remains every bit as weird as I recall. One thing I'd forgotten is how much heavy lifting the moody,evocative soundtrackdoes, especially with how much the visuals have dated. It's also surprisingly well written for a game about fighting giant bugs while turning into a giant bug. But how good Entomorph is or isn't ultimately doesn't matter. What matters is that it furnished me with a basic understanding of how a role-playing game works. I didn't use this knowledge again until The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind came around. But when it did, I recognised it as a bit like Entomorph (not least because it'salsoa game with a bit of a giant bug fixation) and that was enough of a foothold for me to learn about character stats and levelling and all that roleplaying jazz.

    "title": "Elden Ring Nightreign is the first FromSoftware game that I honestly wish I could play on easy",
    "article_text": "Nightreign would be a much stickier roguelike if its randomness extended to easier, and more varied, challenges. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Elden RingNightreign is hard in a way that noFromSoftwaregame over the last decade has been. Where the pacing of Dark Souls and Elden Ring normally reward patience, Nightreign demands a speedrunner's frenzy. Where the intricate dungeons of those games encourage memorization, so that you can dart in to grab a killer weapon or key item your second go-round, Nightreign randomizes everything. The map could be overflowing with the types of weapons that'll make a boss go down easily… or it might not offer you a single one. And where FromSoftware's recent games almost always offer a shortcut or spawn point that lets you quickly re-attempt a boss, a loss in Nightreign means you've got to repeat a whole 40 minute run for another chance. After some 30 hours of Nightreign over the review period, I'm convinced it could be a killer co-op hang-out game—butonlyif FromSoftware adds ways to play that make the game much easier. And harder, too. Because what's really missing is variety. While traditional Souls games thrive on the catharsis of surmounting ever-escalating challenges, that's just not what makes roguelikes fun. Moment-to-moment Nightreign isn't actually as demanding as Sekiro or Bloodborne—but dying can feel much more deflating, because FromSoftware's multiplayer experiment only offers the bare skeleton of a roguelike, with none of the supporting systems that tend to bring these kinds of games to life. When I first played it at FromSoftware's offices in Tokyolast December, reaching and defeating the first Nightlord,Gladius, was a triumphant moment: we'd spent four hours getting our asses kicked as we learned the game and practiced coordinating as a team, which set us up to punch Gladius's ticket when we got some great weapon drops on the next run. That felt great! Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Less great: Getting all the way to that boss and losing, with only a few random, likely useless rewards to show for the time. Losing in any roguelikecanfeel crushing—they draw from deep pools of weapons, enemies, and other modifiers to remain exciting and challenging, and sometimes those things conspire to ruin your day. But failing a Nightreign run often feels bad to me in a way that most roguelikes don't, because it really offers you only one goal and one way to play: survive to the end and kill the Nightlord for better rewards, or fail and get worse ones. With each \"day\" lasting only a few minutes of frantic scavenging, and each finale a high stakes showdown against huge bosses that can typically kill you in a single hit, Nightreign is the tryhard zenith of FromSoftware design: if you're notlocked in, you're probably already dead. Sometimes I'm absolutely game for that, but the more of Nightreign I've played, the more long-term potential I think it would have if FromSoftware had actually committed much harder to its asset reuse and dumpedtonsmore bosses from Dark Souls and Elden Ring into the game, with some of them blatant push-overs that I can pound into the dust while only half paying attention. I also want the brutally hard bosses! But instead of being theonlyobjectives to shoot for, Nightreign's eight Nightlords should be the game's highest tier goal, with easier and more varied challenges kicking around beneath them. Elden Ring Nightreign tips- Start your run rightNightreign tier list- The best nightfarersBest Nightreign rune farm route- Level up fastBest Nightreign team comps- Squad goalsNightreign best relics- The rite stuffNightreign bosses list- Every Nightlord It's been funny watching some commenters quickly judge Nightreign as a trend-chasing cash-in when it has in fact resisted including almost any of the \"genre standard\" features that compel me to replay roguelikes again and again. Take the progression in Hades as a prime example: early on, just making it to the final battle against the god of the underworld is a struggle. But as your skills improve you also accrue points you can use to get stronger until beating Hades feels trivial—and instead of that final battle being your only goal, ggwp uninstall, the game blossoms from there. You can unlock different forms for each weapon that change how they play. You can apply modifiers to each run that add challenges for better rewards. You can earn unique items for the time you spend nurturing relationships with other characters. Not only are all those things satisfying, but they give purpose to repeated playthroughs. Maybe you want to crank up a ton of difficulty modifiers and beat Hades at his most punishing—that's a run you have to be utterly locked in for. But maybe after one of those, you just want to keep hanging out in Hades' world and beat a low stakes run with a weapon you haven't used much, or polish off that one character's questline you still haven't seen to the end. Inmy favorite co-op roguelike, Risk of Rain 2, my friends and I would often set the difficulty to easy to see how ridiculously overpowered our builds could get—we'd forgo fighting the final boss to just keep looping through levels and see how much crazy stuff we could accrue. Other times we'd set the difficulty to hard and try to reach the final boss as quickly as possible to defeat him and tick off one of the game's primary challenges—an accomplishment that took a lot of practice, as well as a good bit of RNG luck. It would beso funto be able to do the same in Nightreign. Let me set some theoretical sliders to easy so I can stay on the field for four days instead of two, stacking my entire inventory with legendary weapons and smiting field bosses with a single swipe of the Sword of Night and Flame. Or let me fight the final boss on the equivalent of NG++, and earn something special for the accomplishment. Checklists of challenges and unlocks are not typically FromSoftware's bag, so I'm notsurprisedto see them absent here. But it would've been relatively simple to give players a lot more to accomplish in Nightreign with some light structural changes—some progression systems beyond random relics and the meagermemory fragmentobjectives for each character, some lower-tier bosses to target for chill runs. Let me walk through the boss door and see Pinwheel waiting for me to disintegrate all his bones with a single hit. Give each character a couple alternate starter weapons and alternate ultimate abilities to unlock by accomplishing certain feats in battle. Challenge me to kill every boss in a single run! Nightreign may actually see more post-launch support than FromSoftware's typical games—the studio has said it plans to add another character, more bosses and \"additional DLC,\" whatever that means. I hope, in this case, it means actually chasing a trend for once and cribbing from other games that have excelled at making randomness their whole deal. Just likePC Gamer reviewer Tyler Colp, I've had a lot of fun with Nightreign's fast-forward remix of Elden Ring. I just want a lot more reasons to keep playing it.

    "title": "'The journey was long': two years later than planned, boomer shooter Project Warlock 2 blasts out of early access with a 50% discount and a request to submit your own loading screen tips",
    "article_text": "\"Perhaps that second step sequel-wise should have been a smaller one.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Project Warlock was a thoroughly entertaining FPS throwbackwhich caught the bloody wave of the boomer shooter revival right at its height in 2018. As such, I was excited by the prospect of a sequel, and one was dulyrevealed at the PC Gaming Show in 2021. Then, years passed. My eyesight deteriorated, flecks of grey appeared in my beard, and my short-term memory was obliterated by a delightful bout of Covid. As such, I completely forgot about Project Warlock 2 until this very week, when the game sprung unexpectedly out of early access. As it turns out, the last four years have been a bit of a trial for developer Buckshot Software, which concedes to biting off a little more than it could chew with the sequel (or at least, chewefficiently). \"Project Warlock II continues a story of the first game, but was always meant to be more than just a remix of the old locales, weapons and enemies within a given template,\" writes Buckshot in itsSteam post announcing the launch. \"It was ambitious, it was bigger, longer, meatier and offered not one, but three protagonists.\" Apparently, this ambition led to the game taking significantly longer than anticipated. \"In hindsight, perhaps that second step sequel-wise should have been a smaller one, as this resulted in the game being pushed from the originally conceived date of 2023 to 2025,\" Buckshot continues. \"But I feel this is the best version of Project Warlock 2 both the team [at] Buckshot and I could come up with.\" I'll reserve judgement about \"best\" until I've had a chance to play Project Warlock 2 properly. But this final version certainly is beefy. The game features three campaigns, each placing you in the role of a different character, as well as 36 levels, 54 weapons, a whole bunch of perks, upgrades and spells, and more than 50 monsters. It even bundles in a \"realmshift mode\" that lets you play through any chapter with any character. That seems like a lot of a game for what is, certainly at the moment, not a lot of money. For the next week plus gibs,Project Warlock 2 is available at a 50% discount, meaning you can pick it up for $8.50 (£6.74). That discount ends on June 11, but if you decide to pick up the game in the next couple of days, Buckshot is running a fun little community event whereplayers can submit their own game tips. These may be selected for inclusion in Project Warlock 2's loading screens, all properly accredited to the tipster. That's a neat way of involving players in the release, and may yield some slightly more atypical hints that what you usually see running along the bottom of a loading screen.

Through these updates, officially known as The Muckingham Files, developer FuturLab has been steadily adding free levels into PowerWash Simulator since 2023, commencing with an Area 51-ish satellite station situated in the game's Mauka Aitu Desert. The previous update added a dirty dessert parlour to clean up, while other added locations include anaquariumand a cryptobro's mansion. This final update sort-of brings the series full circle, as players descend back into the Muckingham subway from the vanilla game for one last job. This time, you're cleaning up a subway train rather than the tunnels themselves, scouring the grime and graffiti from the carriages to bring them to a sparkling sheen. From here, the update transports players to a sculpture park to clean up several artful statues, including, er, a giant glittering garden gnome. As of this latest update, PowerWash Simulator apparently now features 100 cleaning jobs, if you include the various DLC on top of what's available in the base game. \"We hope you enjoy this final PowerWash Simulator update as much as we have enjoyed creating it,\" writes FuturLab in the update's Steam post. \"The team have poured their hearts and souls into creating a world for you all to escape to and clean, somewhere for you to relax and solo clean, or a place to gather with friends and catch up over a satisfying wash.\" With PowerWash Simulator now done and dusted, FuturLab will presumably move the entirety of its focus toPowerWash Simulator 2.The sequel was revealed back in March, and will bring a fresh career mode with 38 jobs on launch, alongside new features like split-screen coop and \"improved soap\".

    "article_text": "He Who Watches releases in the autumn. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There were a bunch of excellent-looking puzzle games revealed at this week's Thinky Direct, includinga new mystery game from one of the designers of the Case of the Golden Idol, and atime-loop based \"Metroidbrainia\"(a portmanteau that caused me physical pain) which swaps out tool-gathering for puzzle-solving. The game that really stood out to me, however, wasHe Who Watches, a gravity-defying \"dungeon puzzler\" that's most easily summarised as Legend of Grimrock meets Portal. He Who Watches takes the trappings of the classic dungeon crawlers of yore, with you playing an adventurer armed with a bow and arrow, exploring a labyrinthine underground maze using classic tile-based movement. But it replaces the RPG elements of traditional dungeon crawlers with 3D spatial puzzling. So instead of shooting your bow at monsters, you'll shoot it at switches to open doors, and at 3D blocks to pull them around on a magical chain. There are two key elements to He Who Watches' puzzling. The first is you only have one arrow, which you can recall at any time. The second is that your character can walk on walls and ceilings. Since you can only shoot your arrow directly ahead of you, this means you often need to manoeuvre yourself into specific positions to progress. If there's a button on the floor you need to shoot, for example, you'll have to find a way onto the adjacent wall in order to hit it. At a more advanced level, you'll also use your sticky boots to manipulate other objects, such as shifting blocks around to insert them into holes or stack them atop one another. The newly released trailer does a great job of showing off the spatial ingenuity of the puzzling. But it also made me want to barf a bit. All the speedy flipping around of the camera set off my motion-sickness instantaneously, and I was concerned about whether that would also be the case in the game. Fortunately, there's also ademo available, so I downloaded that to see how the game affected me in play. And thankfully, He Who Watches is far less nausea-inducing when you're in direct control. It also makes you feel immensely clever in that mind-expanding Portal fashion. Even the basic puzzles are deeply satisfying to feel out, and it has a pleasant difficulty curve that smoothly introduces you to all the tools. Anyway, it immediately shot up my list of most anticipated games for the year. There's no firm release date for He Who Watches yet, but the trailer confirms that it will launch sometime in the autumn.

    "title": "Atomfall is getting a spooky DLC set on an offshore island that also lets you blast pretend pirates with a blunderbuss",
    "article_text": "Set sail for Wicked Isle next week. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Atomfall wasn't as good as it could have beenwhen it launched in March, mainly due to its barebones combat and anaemic stealth and survival systems. But I nonetheless enjoyed exploring Rebellion's eerie take on the Lake District while unravelling the mystery behind the catastrophe at the Windscale Power Plant. I'd be more than happy to ramble through a little extra of that world, and it just so happens that more Atomfall will wash up on the Cumbrian coast next week. The Wicked Isle DLCadds a whole new offshore region to Atomfall's map. Named Midsummer Island, this area unsurprisingly plays on the folk horror elements of the original. Expect to encounter a lot of druids and at least one wicker man, as well as new locations like a ruined abbey, and a pub called the Jolly Angler. Despite being in the sea, Midsummer Island is somehow closer to the Windscale plant than much of Atomfall's vanilla map. Consequently, the inhabitants are more affected by its influence. Enemy factions here include pirate-cosplaying bandits and strange aquatic monsters that look a bit like The Witcher's drowners. You'll be able to fight these enemies with several new weapons, including a cutlass, the \"Beekeeper's Staff\", and a blunderbuss shotgun, which you can see in action in the DLC's trailer above. Personally, I thought the druids were one of the weaker parts of Atomfall's story, quite generically flavoured murderous nature lovers. But perhaps Wicked Isle can flesh them out a bit in the DLC. Either way, I'm more interested in the new story threads Wicked Isle adds. Atomfall was at its strongest when you were unpeeling the enigma behind the Windscale plant and how it related to the Interchange, the massive, Black Mesa-ish underground research facility that sprawls beneath the area. Rather than telling a separate tale, Wicked Isle's story will interweave with the main game. There are several new leads to uncover, some of which will unlock entirely new endings. I liked unpicking Atomfall's various threads, and your choices had a tangible effect on how everything played out, so that's a good enough reason for another run. Wicked Isle arrives on June 3, and will cost $20 (£15) when it does. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "Quantum computing startup wants to launch a 1000-qubit machine by 2031 that could make the traditional HPC market obsolete",
    "article_text": "Slashes energy use by 99% in cryptographic test When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A quantum computing startup has announced plans to develop a utility-scale quantum computer with more than 1,000 logical qubits by 2031. Nord Quantique has set an ambitious target which, if achieved, could signal a seismic shift in high-performance computing (HPC). The company claims its machines are smaller and would offer far greater efficiency in both speed and energy consumption, thereby making traditional HPC systems obsolete. Nord Quantique uses “multimode encoding” via a technique known as the Tesseract code, and this allows each physical cavity in the system to represent more than one quantum mode, effectively increasing redundancy and resilience without adding complexity or size. “Multimode encoding allows us to build quantum computers with excellent error correction capabilities, but without the impediment of all those physical qubits,” explained Julien Camirand Lemyre, CEO of Nord Quantique. “Beyond their smaller and more practical size, our machines will also consume a fraction of the energy, which makes them appealing for instance to HPC centers where energy costs are top of mind.” Nord’s machines would occupy a mere 20 square meters, making them highly suitable fordata centerintegration. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Compared to 1,000–20,000 m² needed by competing platforms, this portability further strengthens its case. “These smaller systems are also simpler to develop to utility-scale due to their size and lower requirements for cryogenics and control electronics,” the company added. The implication here is significant: better error correction without scaling physical infrastructure, a central bottleneck in the quantum race. In a technical demonstration, Nord’s system exhibited excellent stability over 32 error correction cycles with no measurable decay in quantum information. “Their approach of encoding logical qubits in multimode Tesseract states is a very effective method of addressing error correction and I am impressed with these results,” said Yvonne Gao, Assistant Professor at the National University of Singapore. “They are an important step forward on the industry’s journey toward utility-scale quantum computing.” Such endorsements lend credibility, but independent validation and repeatability remain critical for long-term trust. Nord Quantique claims its system could solve RSA-830, a representative cryptographic challenge, in just one hour using 120 kWh of energy at 1 MHz speed, slashing the energy need by 99%. In contrast, traditional HPC systems would require approximately 280,000 kWh over nine days. Other quantum modalities, such as superconducting, photonic, cold atoms, and ion traps, fall short in either speed or efficiency. For instance, cold atoms might consume only 20 kW, but solving the same problem would take six months. That said, there remains a need for caution. Post-selection - used in Nord’s error correction demonstrations, required discarding 12.6% of data per round. While this helped show stability, it introduces questions about real-world consistency. In quantum computing, the leap from laboratory breakthrough to practical deployment can be vast; thus, the claims on energy reduction and system miniaturization, though striking, need independent real-world verification.

    "title": "Seagate CEO hints at 150TB hard drives thanks to novel 15TB platters, but notes it won't happen for another decade",
    "article_text": "HAMR technology remains Seagate’s crown jewel for scaling drive capacity When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. AtSeagate’s recent 2025 Investor and Analyst Conference, CEO Dr. Dave Mosley and CTO Dr. John Morrisoutlined the company’s long-term roadmapfor hard drive innovation. This hinted at the possibility of 150TB hard drives, thelargest HDDever, by groundbreaking 15TB platters, but cautioned that this milestone remains at least a decade away. The foundation of this future lies in Seagate’s HAMR (Heat-Assisted Magnetic Recording) technology, currently being deployed through the company’s Mozaic platform. “We have high confidence in our product roadmap through Mozaic 5. And notably, the design space for granular iron platinum media that's in Mozaic 3 looks very viable to get us up to 10 terabytes per disk,” said Dr. Morris That 10TB-per-disk benchmark is expected to be reached by 2028. “We do have confidence that we can provide a path to 10 terabytes per disk in roughly this time frame,” Morris added, explaining that spin-stand demonstrations of new technologies typically take five years to reach product qualification. Looking beyond 10TB, Seagate is exploring how to extend the capabilities of its Iron Platinum media. “We believe that there's another level of extension of that granular iron platinum architecture that could theoretically get as high as 15 terabytes per disk,” Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Such an achievement would pave the way for 150TB hard drives by stacking 10 platters per unit. However, he warned, “beyond 15 terabytes per disk is going to require some level of disruptive innovation.” Seagate’s CEO, Dave Mosley, echoed this long-range vision, noting, “We now know how we can get to 4 and 5 and beyond. As a matter of fact, we have visibility... beyond 10 terabytes of disk with the HAMR technology.” “It’s not going to be easy, but I’m convinced that’s going to keep us on a competitive cost trajectory that no other technology is going to supplant in the next decade, probably beyond.” The company’s confidence is backed by recent milestones. Mozaic 3, which delivers 3TB per platter, is now in volume production, and Mozaic 4 (4TB per platter) is scheduled to enter customer qualification next quarter. Seagate expects to begin volume shipments of Mozaic 4 drives in the first half of 2026. Meanwhile, Mozaic 5, targeting 5TB per platter, is planned for customer qualification in late 2027 or early 2028. Still, Seagate made it clear that 150TB drives based on 15TB platters are not imminent. As Morris emphasized, “This is just one other element in the work that we do to underpin our strategy... it will take time. There’s still a lot of work in front of us to get there.” Efosa has been writing about technology for over 7 years, initially driven by curiosity but now fueled by a strong passion for the field.

    "article_text": "Device details leaked When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It appears we may soon get a couple of new contenders for ourbest smartwatches list. HMD (perhaps best known for releasing Nokia-branded phones in recent years) is rumored to be working on two smartwatches, both running Wear OS, and with a camera fitted to one of them. This comes from tipster@smashx_60(viaNotebookcheck), and while we can't guarantee the accuracy of the claim, smartwatches would be a sensible next step for HMD – which already makes phones, tablets, earbuds, andthe HMD OffGrid. According to the leak, the first smartwatch will be the HMD Rubber 1, with a 1.85-inchOLEDscreen, a 400 mAh battery, and heart rate and spO2 tracking. There's also, apparently, a 2-megapixel camera on board this model. Then there's the HMD Rubber 1S, which comes with a smaller 1.07-inch OLED display, a smaller 290 mAh battery, and no camera – though the heart rate and SpO2 tracking features are still included. It sounds as though this will be the cheaper choice. HMD RUBBER 1- oled 1.85\" display - 5ATM Waterproof - BT5.3, WiFi, NFC, Accelerometer, heart rate, SpO2- 2MP CAM- Wear OS- 400mAh, USB-C, QiHMD RUBBER 1S- oled 1.07\" - 5ATM Waterproof - BT5.0, WiFi, Accelerometer, heart rate, SpO2- Wear OS- 290mAh, USB-C, QiMay 29, 2025 The camera on the HMD Rubber 1 is interesting, as this would be something we haven't seen on a Wear OS watch before. While it's not clear how the camera would be integrated, presumably it would allow photos and videos to be captured from your wrist, with or without a phone connected. There's some speculation in the Notebookcheck article that these smartwatches may be intended for kids to use, rather than adults – something along the lines ofthe Samsung Galaxy Watch for Kidsthat launched at the start of the year, perhaps. The leak also mentions that these smartwatches will come with 5 ATM waterproofing, which is good for depths of up to 50 meters. That suggests they'll have a relatively robust casing around the internal components. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. We'll have to wait and see what HMD might have in store, though as yet there's been nothing official from the company. In the meantime, we're patiently waiting for the arrival of Wear OS 6, which is expected to be pushed out in the next month or two.

    "article_text": "HDR support and strong contrast deliver cinematic visuals When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. InnoCN has introduced the 40C1U, a 40-inch ultrawide 5K monitor which, at least on paper, appears to challenge high-end offerings fromAppleand other industry giants. This device looks to meet the needs of professionals in photography,video editing, and design, as well as developers and remote workers. Though the display touts impressive specs, skepticism remains about whether a lesser-known brand can rival thebest monitors for Photoshopor seamless pairing with a Mac Mini. The standout feature of the InnoCN 40C1U is undoubtedly its 5120 x 2160 resolution across a sprawling 40-inch IPS panel. The factory-calibrated screen offers a Delta E < 2, supporting 135% sRGB and 106% DCI-P3 color gamut - specifications that claim to cater to users who need precise and reliable color accuracy. The ultrawide 21:9 aspect ratio provides an expansive workspace ideal for single-screen multitasking, and with a 100Hz refresh rate,HDR-readiness, and a 1200:1 contrast ratio, the monitor supports fluid visuals and decent depth in both dark and bright scenes. For gamers and content creators handling high-frame-rate media, this may be a perk, though whether the HDR implementation truly rivals more premium displays remains unclear. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The inclusion of integrated 5W stereo speakers may reduce the need for external sound equipment in casual environments, but audiophiles and professionals will likely still prefer external solutions. Connectivity is where the InnoCN 40C1U might surprise even hardened skeptics. With HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 1.4, USB-A/B, and a USB-C port that delivers 65W of power, this monitor is well-equipped to serve as a full docking station for modern workflows. For users seeking thebest monitor for Mac Mini, the USB-C power delivery and wide color support make this an attractive option. This monitor also offers height, tilt, and swivel adjustments and supports VESA mounting. Other features include blue light reduction and flicker-free technology to mitigate eye strain. Still, the question arises: can a brand still gaining market traction deliver consistent performance at the same level as Apple,LG, orDell, especially over time? Skeptics might want to wait for long-term color fidelity benchmarks before replacing their Eizo or Apple Studio Displays. Priced at $749.99 (promotional) with a regular retail of $999.99, the 40C1U certainly undercuts Apple’s high-end displays and those from other premium players.

    "article_text": "Filming for High Potential season 2 is officially underway When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. - Officially began filming in May- Slated for a fall 2025 release- Will be 18 episodes long- Main cast set to return- No official plot synopsis revealed- No news on a season 3 renewal High Potentialseason 2 is on the way and, after an early renewal, the cast and crew are already back filming. Even better news, it's already been confirmed by ABC that the show will return as part of the fall release schedule in 2025. So, if you loveHigh Potentialas much as me, you'll be feeling pretty pleased right now. WhenHigh Potentialseason 1 hit our screens for the first time, we were introduced to Morgan, a single mom working as a cleaner at the LAPD, until her brilliant mind found her in a new role in the department, helping to solve the unsolvable crimes. Upon release, the show topped the charts acrossHuluandDisney+, with the finale episode earning a series high viewership on streaming. Here's everything we know aboutHigh Potentialseason 2 from when it's likely to arrive, confirmed cast, plot rumors, news and more. A post shared by High Potential (@highpotentialabc) A photo posted by on High Potentialseason 2 was renewed in January, in the midst of season 1, and as of May, filming officially commenced with the main cast posing with a clapperboard in the show's Instagram announcement. Even thoughHigh Potentialseason 1 only concluded in February, it appears we won't have to wait long at all for season 2. As reported byDeadline, while there's no specific release date for season 2, it has been revealed that it will be part of the fall release schedule. Not only that, but the episode count is being extended, too. There will be 18 episodes of the crime drama for its second season, as opposed to the first's 13. Excellent news. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. As the cast and crew only began filming in May, there’s noHigh Potentialseason 2 trailer to share, just yet. With a fall release schedule though, it'll most likely drop by the end of summer. I'll update here as soon as it does. Spoilers follow forHigh Potentialseason 1, and possibly for season 2. While the Instagram post from set told us that filming had commenced, it also revealed some of the cast members who are returning. So far, the confirmedHigh Potentialseason 2 cast is as follows: And given howHigh Potentialseason 1 finished, we said goodbye to JD Pardo as Tom as he left Los Angeles (and Morgan) to pursue his nursing school dream. I think it is safe to say though that Morgan's two kids, Amirah J as Ava and Matthew Lamb as Elliott, will star – though it's yet to be confirmed. The final few episodes of season 1 also saw the introduction of two new characters – one guest star and one villain. Firstly, guest star Jocko Sims starred as Ronnie Oliver in a couple of episodes of seaosn 1. And when asked if he'll be returning, showrunner Todd Harthan toldTheWrap: \"We'll have to plot and plan the season, who knows, but he's wonderful. This season, there will be all kinds of opportunities for great guest stars.\" And then, of course, there's David Giuntoli as the serial killer villain, David Peck. I'll get into more about David's role in the newest season as we jump into theHigh Potentialseason 2 story synopsis below. Whether either of these cast members are returning for season 2, we'll have to wait and see, but for David at least it seemsverylikely. Full spoilers forHigh Potentialseason 1 to follow. High Potentialfollows Morgan, a single mum and police department cleaner who turns her genius mind to help solve the 'unsolvable'. Quickly changing departmental roles, Morgan is brought into the fold as a police consultant fighting crime with her unconventional mind. AndHigh Potentialseason 1 enthralled viewers with crimefighting and personal dramas. But, it also left viewers witha lotof questions. The biggest, perhaps, being that Morgan's ex Roman is in fact alive and Karadec has revealed he knows where he is. And that's before we even address the introduction of new big bad serial killer villain, David (prev. the 'Game Master') who left Morgan a note when avoiding capture that they're going to \"play again\". Thus, teeing up his character for a haunting return inHigh Potentialseason 2. Fortunately, showrunner Todd Harthan has every intention of addressing these jaw-clenching cliffhangers for us. Speaking to TheWrap, he said: \"We have a pretty healthy plan for how we're going to kick off the season. I think one of the big mistakes that shows make is [saying] 'Oh, let's put a pin in both those cliffhangers, and we'll get to them later.'\" Adding: \"The promise in Season 2 is to answer some other big questions, but also deepen the mystery before we really unpack too much or introduce somebody too soon.\" And when it comes to the simmering tension between Morgan and Karadec, Harthan revealed: \"I think there's going to be a freshness to this relationship that we're going to write to that is not going to fall into some of the similar traps or tropes of other shows.\" Olson added: \"People are so excited for when Morgan and Karadec get together. That's what makes a good show, is trying to find a place where we give you something that's unexpected, but we also satisfy what it is that you're looking for and you don't feel like you're watching like a very predictable story that you already know.\" Though Tom turned up after accepting Morgan's invite to the police gala, he still left LA and in doing so left the door open for potential between Morgan and Karadec. But, there's another spanner in the works with Morgan's ex Roman, which Harthan toldTVLinewould be a big part ofHigh Potentialseason 2: \"I think it has to kick it up a notch. If I keep it at the same level, just dipping our toe in the water instead of jumping into the pool, that's the kind of thing that might frustrate the audience. \"So I think we have to find meaningful upgrades and give them bigger bites of the story, if you will, in season 2. It'll be a little bit of a deeper dive.\" It's not at all clear, yet. GivenHigh Potentialwas renewed for season 2 during season 1's run, I imagine we won't have an answer for you until at least the end of 2025, or early 2026. But if theHigh Potentialseason 1 stats are anything to go by, as reported byABC, it's definitely pointing in a positive direction. Season 1 hit series highs in both total viewers, 13.2 million, and for adults 18-49 after seven days of viewing on ABC, Hulu, Hulu on Disney+ and digital platforms. IfHigh Potentialseason 2 can captivate the audience once again, it seems the show could continue for more seasons to come. There's no official word on a season 3, but I'll be sure to update here if/when there is. For now, you can streamHigh Potentialseason 1 on Hulu in the US and Disney+ in the UK.

We're firmly in spoiler territory now, but read on if you want to know what the four theme answers are for today's NYT Connections puzzles… Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. What are the answers for today's NYT Connections groups? Right, the answers are below, so DO NOT SCROLL ANY FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE THEM. The answers to today's Connections, game #722, are… As someone who considers going to the supermarket akin to a mythical QUEST, the four words that made up the yellow EXPEDITION group were an easy spot. The rest of today’s puzzle? Less so. The letter Y isn’t strictly a vowel, but is classified as such when there is no other vowel or when it is found at the end of a word. I looked this up afterwards as the only reason I got MYRRH, NYMPH, RHYTHM, SPHYNX as a group is that they had a Y in the middle of the word. By the same reasoning I should have also gotten NAMES ENDING IN \"K\" PLUS WORD but by this point I was done – or donezo as they say on reality TV. How did you do today? Let me know in the comments below. NYT Connections is one of several increasingly popular word games made by the New York Times. It challenges you to find groups of four items that share something in common, and each group has a different difficulty level: green is easy, yellow a little harder, blue often quite tough and purple usually very difficult. On the plus side, you don't technically need to solve the final one, as you'll be able to answer that one by a process of elimination. What's more, you can make up to four mistakes, which gives you a little bit of breathing room. It's a little more involved than something like Wordle, however, and there are plenty of opportunities for the game to trip you up with tricks. For instance, watch out for homophones and other word games that could disguise the answers. It's playable for free via theNYT Games siteon desktop or mobile.

    "title": "You can fit an SSD on this graphics card that has a USB Type-C connector, but I am not a fan of its fake wood finish",
    "article_text": "Asus merges aesthetics and utility, but many creatives do not like the trend When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Asus has unveiled its latest addition to the ProArt lineup, the GeForce RTX 5080, equipped with features designed to attract creatives. TheProArt RTX 5080stays true to Asus’ minimalistic design philosophy but introduces a new twist: a “noble dark wood grain” foil on the side of the card. This wood pattern has sparked mixed reactions and does not sit well with many tech enthusiasts, but thankfully, it’s optional, as several other models of the same GPU do not use this design. Perhaps more relevant than the appearance is the ProArt RTX 5080’s standout technical feature: an integrated M.2 slot for SSDs. Asus has tried this before with the RTX 4060 Ti, where unused PCIe lanes allowed an SSD to function without impacting GPU performance. But this time, implementation details remain murky. The RTX 5080 is connected via a full 16 PCIe lanes, raising a fundamental concern. “Does an installed SSD permanently ‘steal’ lanes from the graphics card, thereby reducing its memory throughput?” That’s a crucial question for professionals who need consistent performance in demanding environments like high-resolution video rendering or 3D modeling. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! In theory, the built-in M.2 slot could allow faster workflows by directly offloading high-bandwidth assets onto the GPU cooling system. Asus claims the SSD will “boast PCIe Gen 5 speeds and effectively dissipate heat to the card’s heatsink for cooler temperatures.” If the heat management works as promised and performance isn’t compromised, this could be a game changer for creative setups, especially those looking for thebest monitor for video editingor thebest monitors for Photoshop, where fast file access is paramount. A USB Type-C port also makes its debut on this card, a notable addition for anyone building a workstation around flexibility. It opens up new use cases, especially for professionals using modern displays and peripherals. For creatives using thebest monitor for Mac Mini, which often relies on USB-C for streamlined connectivity, this is a welcome development. Despite its compact 2.5-slot form factor, Asus promises top-tier cooling with a vapor chamber, phase-change thermal pad, and axial-tech fans. Combined with the MaxContact surface and Auto-Extreme manufacturing process, the ProArt RTX 5080 reads like a technically thoughtful card on paper. But pricing remains a sticking point. The “cheapest” custom cards are quite expensive, thus, the premium top-of-the-line cards are even harder to bear.

    "article_text": "Made with repair in mind When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. TheSonyWH-1000XM6 headphoneslaunched a couple of weeks ago, and have already attracted plenty of praise – see ourSony WH-1000XM6 review, for example. Now we have another reason for investing in a pair: they're easier to repair than previous models. According tothe experts at iFixit, \"Sony appears to have made a deliberate effort to design the WH-1000XM6 with repair in mind\", and there have been tweaks to how these headphones have been put together that show that. Crucially, iFixit says, the battery inside the headphones is now fixed in place with two screws – rather than being stuck in with the double-sided adhesive that was used for theSony WH-1000XM5, which launched back in 2022. The modular driver mid-plate is straightforward to replace as well, iFixit says – there's no glue to deal with, and the component can be got at without the risk of damaging other parts of the interior of the headphones. iFixit also reports that the USB-C port, the audio jack, and the button board are \"readily accessible\", making repairs easier. The idea is that if one part of the Sony WH-1000XM6 headphones fails, you don't have to completely replace them. It's not all good news on the repairability front though: iFixit says there's not much improvement as far as the headband goes, so if there's a problem with this part of the device then you may well have to get a new pair. Of course when we say the Sony WH-1000XM6 are easier to repair, you do still need a certain amount of technical know-how and some specialist tools for the job. However, the job now is more straightforward, whether you do it yourself or take it into a repair shop. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. There's plenty of advice over oniFixitabout how you might go about repairing the Sony WH-1000XM6 headphones and a whole host of other gadgets, but if you're weighing up the pros of buying them, you can add repairability to the list.

    "title": "The Sage Barista Impress is so satisfying to use, I just want to make lattes all day",
    "article_text": "The lever-operated tamper is too much fun When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I'm lucky enough to test some of thebest coffee makersaround for TechRadar, but the Sage Barista Touch Impress (known as the Breville Barista Touch Impress outside of the UK) is the most satisfying I've ever used. It's all thanks to the Impress Puck System, which lets you create a perfectly-formed bed of coffee in the filter basket by pulling down a lever on the side of the machine – and it's brilliant. I've been using the Barista Touch Impress for a few days now and, so far, it's been an absolute pleasure. It's around half the price of theDe'Longhi Primadonna AromaticI reviewed recently, but still has the feeling of a premium bean-to-cup espresso machine. It's supplied with single-walled and pressurized filter baskets (the latter of which make it easier for new users to create a well-extracted espresso), the portafilter feels reassuringly weighty in the hand, and it's supplied with a full set of cleaning tools that sit tidily in a storage drawer behind the drip tray. It also comes with an 'eco starter kit', which contains sachets of descaler, group head cleaner, grinder cleaner, and steam wand cleaner, together with a nice microfiber barista cloth. It's a thoughtful addition, and the machine will walk you through each of the cleaning processes when it's time to freshen things up. You also get a water filter as standard. Some of thebest espresso machinescome with one, while others require you to buy one separately if you live in a hard water area, or just to remove impurities that might affect the taste of your coffee. There's a water testing strip to determine the hardness of your tap water and, if it's particularly hard, Sage recommends using filtered water instead. You should never use distilled water in an espresso machine, though. Not only can it make coffee taste flat, it's a poor conductor of electricity, which can throw off the water level sensors that let the machine know if the tank is sufficiently full. One of the trickiest parts of being a barista is choosing the right grind size for your coffee beans (a process known as 'dialling in'). Too large and the water will flow through to coffee too quickly, and only the sour flavor compounds will dissolve in the water. Too fast, and you'll get the sweet flavors you want, but also bitter compounds that leave your mouth feeling dry. Think of the difference between water running through a bucket of marbles and a bucket of sand. The marbles have larger gaps in between, so the water moves through quickly. The Sage Barista Touch Impress doesn't do all the work of dialling in for you, but makes it as easy as possible and helps you understand the process. If you want to switch to a fully manual espresso machine at a later date, you'll be able to hit the ground running. After filling the water tank and loading up your preferred beans, the Barista Touch Impress will walk you through the process of making your first coffee. Your initial options are espresso, long black, latte, cappuccino, and flat white. There are, though a lot more options available (both hot and cold) once you’ve completed the initial setup – indeed, I'm not sure what a 'shakerato' is, but I look forward to finding out as it sounds tasty. Insert a basket into the portafilter handle, then push it under the grinder spout and tap the picture of a basket on the touchscreen to get started. The Barista Touch Impress will grind a portion of beans straight into the basket for you, then – and this is the fun part – prompt you to pull down the lever on the left-hand side of the machine to tamp it down. You don't need to apply much pressure at all, but it's very satisfying. You're advised to pull it down twice each time. Double the fun. Cleverly, the machine will detect how much force was required to tamp the coffee, and will suggest adding more coffee to the basket if there wasn't enough. Depending on your chosen beans and the grinder setting, you might need to do this a few times but, once you've got the ideal amount in the basket, the Barista Touch Impress will record the total dosage for next time. Now it's time to twist the portafilter into position under the group head and begin brewing your first espresso. Ideally, it should take around 36 seconds to pull a shot of espresso (give or take a few seconds either side), and the Barista Touch Impress will time it for you. If it's taking too long, you'll be warned that the drink might taste sour and asked whether you're happy to go ahead, or you want to start again with a larger grind size. If the shot is pulled too fast, the machine will advise that it might taste watery. In either case, the Barista Touch Impress will suggest an alternative grind size, which you can set by turning a dial near the tamping lever. It might take a few attempts to dial the grinder in perfectly and it may seem like you're using quite a lot of coffee, but it's just part of the process. You don't want to know how many beans a trainee barista goes through when learning the ropes. It's a lot. When you've eventually created a perfectly balanced espresso, the full menu of drink options will be unlocked and you're free to begin experimenting. So far, I've only scratched the surface of what this great bean-to-cup machine can do, but I'm already thoroughly enjoying it. I'll bring you a full review once I've explored everything it's capable of and determined whether it deserves a place in TechRadar's roundup of thebest bean-to-cup coffee machines. Now, if you'll please excuse me, I need to get some more beans. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

    "title": "I’m an iOS loyalist – here’s why Android has never tempted me to switch",
    "article_text": "Super-seamless systems When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There’s no doubt about it: Android offers a fantastic ecosystem with some of thebest phonesandbest tabletsmoney can buy. When you opt for products powered by Google’soperating system, you’ll find devices that cover just about every need imaginable, frombudget-friendly phonesto feature-rich powerhouses. It’s also a highly customizable system that lets you tweak it in just about any way you can imagine, unlike Apple’s locked down offerings. Yet despite all that, I’ve never owned anAndroid phone. Sure, I had a slide-upSamsungback in the day, but that was probably before Android was even a consideration inside Google HQ (honestly, it was also a terrible phone). Instead, I’ve faithfully stuck withAppleever since I first got an iPhone 3GS, never since venturing outside the famous walled garden. So why have I never been tempted to switch over to the Android side and ditch my Apple products for good, despite the open appeal of Google's mobile operating system? Well, there’s one thing that has made me an Apple loyalist for many years now: the seamless way Apple’s devices all work together, and the incredible features this enables. Apple controls both the hardware and software that underpins its products, and this is something that I think a lot of people really underestimate. If Apple knows exactly which devices and operating systems it will be working with, it knows what kind of features it can build, and it knows that those features should work reliably for everyone. With Android, you’re talking about a huge range of diverse hardware and software configurations. That has its benefits, but it also makes it difficult for developers to account for all that variation. This throws up problems with functionality and compatibility, which limits what can be done to a degree that doesn’t happen with Apple. For example, I love how I can place my iPhone on my Mac’s monitor and itinstantly becomes a webcam, no software setup needed. Or how I can use a single mouse and keyboard onboth my Mac and my iPad, ordrag and drop a file from my iPhone to my Macwithout a hitch. Sure, some of these features work on Android, more or less, but they’re nowhere near as slick. Apple’s features work automatically and intuitively, with no additional software to install and no cumbersome setup process to go through. My Apple devices recognize each other and work together without a hitch. That’s something that I just can’t get on Android – not to the same extent, anyway. So, while Android has a huge amount to offer, it falls short compared to Apple when it comes to this impactful area. That said, my setup is a little more complicated than I originally made out. As well as my Apple kit, I also have a Windows PC, which doesn’t always play nice with my iOS and macOS devices. I certainly can’t use Apple exclusives like Handoff, Universal Control and more across both iOS and Windows, for example. Even though I get to enjoy Apple’s joined-up ecosystem for the most part, there are still hitches when it comes to my PC. What I want is something that offers all this functionality acrossallmy devices. I won’t get that from Apple with its closed-off walled garden – the company doesn’t like sharing, after all. Things like Continuity Camera will never come to Windows, at least not in a native form from Apple. But at the same time, I definitely won’t get that functionality from Android either, which is too dispersed and fragmented to offer the same kind of integration as Apple can provide. Ultimately, Apple still gives me the best way to have all my devices working together near-seamlessly. I absolutely love how using my iPhone, iPad and Mac together unlocks all kinds of neat functions and features that I can’t get anywhere else, and I know that if I switched to Android, I’d lose out on a lot of that. I can’t say if there’s a solution on the horizon that works for both Apple products and the Windows/Android world. But for now, Apple has the upper hand, at least for me. Hopefully, Android can find a way to catch up in the future. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

Videos from the scene show a shirtless man carrying what appear to be bottles of flammable liquid while shouting pro-Palestinian slogans. He is later seen lying on the ground as police move in to detain him. “We are aware of and fully investigating a targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado. Our agents and local law enforcement are on the scene already, and we will share updates as more information becomes available,”FBI Director Kash Patel said on X. Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said officers responded to a report of a suspect“setting people on fire.”He confirmed that several people had been hospitalized, with injuries ranging“from very serious to more minor.” FBI Special Agent Mark Michalek later confirmed that the man yelling“Free Palestine”injured six people. He identified the suspect as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman.“Sadly, attacks like this are becoming too common across the country,”Michalek said.

    "title": "UK must prepare for direct conflict with Russia – defense secretary",
    "article_text": "The UK plans to mobilize billions of pounds to bolster its military-industrial base in preparation for a potential conflict with Russia, Defense Secretary John Healey has said. The statement comes ahead of the publication of the government’s Strategic Defense Review on Monday. According to the BBC, the report is expected to portray Russia and China as major threats to the UK. The review is expected to allocate £1.5 billion ($2 billion) toward building six new munitions factories. Over the next five years, London will dedicate around £6 billion to manufacturing long-range weapons, including Storm Shadow missiles, Healey told the BBC on Sunday. The missile, developed jointly with France, has reportedly been used by Ukraine to strike civilian targets in Russian territory, according to Moscow. “This is a message to Moscow as well. This is Britain standing firm – not only strengthening our Armed Forces, but also reinforcing our industrial base. It’s part of our readiness to fight, if required,”Healey said. Western support for Ukraine has exposed serious weaknesses in arms production, with British military leaders warning that weapons stockpiles are dangerously low, the BBC reported. As one of Kiev’s strongest backers in Europe, London has provided Ukraine with around €15.16 billion ($17.2 billion) in aid, more than two-thirds of which is military support, according to data from Germany’s Kiel Institute. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron have both advocated for placing Western troops in Ukraine. They have lobbied for a peacekeeping force to be deployed in the event of a full ceasefire. Russia has warned that any NATO troops deployed to Ukraine – even under the designation of peacekeepers – would be treated as legitimate targets. It has also stated that foreign involvement would only escalate the conflict and ultimately fail to prevent Russia from achieving its military objectives.",

    "article_text": "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has unveiled a proposal to increase the power of EU members and limit the authority of its bureaucracy. Calling it a“patriotic plan”for the bloc, he said in a series of weekend social media posts that it will revive the“European dream.” The EU elites in Brussels have exploited every crisis to amass more power, Orban claimed in a post on X. This course has so far only translated into less sovereignty for member states and“failed policies,”according to the prime minister.“Brussels hijacked our future”by disrupting public safety through migration and eroding prosperity with“green dogmas,”he stated in another post. “Europe can’t afford this any longer, it’s time to take back control,”he said. The prime minister’s plan is based on what he calls four pillars: A path toward peace on the continent and defusing tensions with Russia, removing Brussels’“centralized control”over finances,“bringing back free speech”and strengthening Europe’s Christian identity, and tightening control over immigration. “We want peace, we don’t need a new Eastern front,”Orban said, commenting on his plan and stating that the bloc should not accept Ukraine as a member.“We don’t want our money poured into someone else’s war,”he added. A military buildup and defense increase actively promoted by some EU nations could easily lock the bloc in an“arms race”with Russia, Orban warned. Such a development would“devour… taxpayers’ money,”he said. Instead of pouring more resources into the military, the bloc needs to contribute to the peace process between Moscow and Kiev, the prime minister maintained, praising US President Donald Trump’s efforts in this regard. The EU needs to start“arms limitation talks with the Russians as soon as possible. Otherwise, all our money will be swallowed by the arms industry instead of being spent on peaceful… goals,”Orban argued. European nations once united to create the“safest and the most advanced continent”in the world, but this dream was“stolen,”the prime minister said, calling on EU nations not to allow Brussels to use the Ukraine conflict“as an excuse to take more of our money.”",

    "title": "Ukraine conflict a NATO ‘proxy war’ - Trump envoy",
    "article_text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin is right in considering the Ukraine conflict a proxy war against Russia, US President Donald Trump’s special envoy Keith Kellogg told Fox News in an interview on Sunday. He said that while he believes the peace process will ultimately succeed,“escalatory issues”remain. Kellogg referred to comments by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who last month indicated that Berlin would be open to supplying Kiev with Taurus cruise missiles. Kellogg addressed Russian President Vladimir Putin's perspective, saying“he considers this a proxy war by NATO. And frankly… in a way it is.” “The escalatory issues are still there,”Kellogg said.“Chancellor Merz has said: well, I’m going to give the Ukrainians the Taurus missile system.” The German cruise missiles have a range of roughly 300 miles (482 km), which can allow Ukrainian strikes to reach deep into Russian territory, Kellog said. He added that Putin has made it clear: if such weapons are supplied to Ukraine, Russia will regard the suppliers as a party to the conflict. “He considers this a proxy war by NATO. And frankly… in a way it is.” Russia can clearly see the other Western military support Ukraine is receiving, Kellogg added. “Everybody has got to be willing to step back a bit,”and compromise, to get the peace process“to an end state,”the envoy said. Last week, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted that Merz’s“provocative”statements“hinder peaceful efforts.”Moscow has stressed that any Ukrainian use of German Taurus missiles against Russian territory will be viewed as Berlin’s direct involvement in the Ukraine conflict, as the armaments’ use is impossible without the participation of Bundeswehr service members. Last year, after Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden allowed the use of US ATACMS ballistic missiles in long-range strikes on Russian territory, Moscow retaliated by revamping its strategic doctrine and lowering the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons. Russia now considers any strike by a non-nuclear state backed up by a nuclear one as a joint attack. Both Kellogg and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio have previously characterized the conflict as a proxy war. “Frankly, it’s a proxy war between nuclear powers – the United States, helping Ukraine, and Russia,”Rubio said in March, noting that the current White House administration is eager to see it end. Moscow has long designated the Ukraine conflict as a Western proxy war against Russia and repeatedly condemned arms supplies to Kiev as counterproductive to the peace process.",

    "title": "The Biden years: When America started to resemble the late-stage USSR",
    "article_text": "It’s been a while since we’ve heard much about Joe Biden, hasn’t it? Yet here he is, back in the headlines – not because of some triumphant return to form, but for all the wrong reasons. The former US president has once again found himself at the center of national attention, thanks to a sequence of revealing and deeply troubling events. It began with Axios publishing the full audio of Biden’s now-infamous interview with special prosecutor Robert Hur. The same interview in which Hur concluded that the then president suffered from serious memory issues. As the recording confirmed, he wasn’t wrong. Biden struggled to recall basic facts – even the date his son died. Days later, another bombshell dropped: Biden had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer. The news barely had time to circulate before the release of Original Sin, a book by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios’s Alex Thompson, tore down what little remained of the White House facade. The authors didn’t just suggest that Biden had declined mentally during his presidency. They asserted that he had not been governing at all. Instead, they described a ‘Politburo’ of family members and close aides who effectively ran the United States in his name. It’s a term that will sound all too familiar to the Russian ear, and one that cuts deeper than many Americans might realize. For years, critics of the US establishment – especially abroad – have joked about the ‘Washington Obkom’, a reference to the old Communist Party regional committees of the Soviet Union. Today that comparison doesn’t seem like satire. It feels like a diagnosis. It’s especially ironic that these revelations are coming not from conservative firebrands or Russian media, but from the very liberal American outlets – CNN, Axios – that worked so hard in 2024 to prop up the Biden administration and conceal the cracks forming behind the curtain. But I’m less interested in their delayed honesty than in the questions Americans are now starting to ask. How did the United States, with all its checks and balances, end up with a gerontocratic shadow government? Why did Washington begin to resemble Moscow circa 1982? Let’s start there. A gerontocracy emerges when the ruling elite can no longer tolerate change. In the USSR, it was the ageing leadership of the Communist Party that clung to power. In the US, it’s the political generation that peaked in the 1990s and 2000s, the last so-called ‘consensus’ generation in American politics. Their grip on power outlasted their ideas. Though Democrats and Republicans had their differences, they broadly agreed on the same post-Cold War worldview. They ran the show for decades – until Donald Trump shattered that illusion in 2016. Trump’s rise forced a reckoning. On the right, younger Republicans moved toward a more nationalist, populist agenda. On the left, Democrats tacked hard toward identity politics and expanded welfare, partly driven by their reliance on minority voting blocs and partly by the legacy of Barack Obama’s progressive rhetoric. By the time Trump’s first term ended, the American political elite faced a nightmare: if they handed power to the next generation, they risked total collapse. The establishment Republicans had already been steamrolled by Trump’s base. Democrats feared the same fate if they embraced their more radical progressives. Their solution was to cling to the past. Enter Joe Biden, a relic of the consensus era, sold to voters as a unifying moderate. In reality, he was a placeholder. A human firewall designed to stop the rising tide on both sides. The hope was that a return to ‘normal’ would restore calm. Instead, it prolonged the crisis. Biden, like Brezhnev before him, became the living embodiment of a system unable to face reality. And now, as Americans look back on the Biden years, they are forced to reckon with the consequences of their denial. Power didn’t disappear, it simply drifted into backrooms and family circles. Decision-making was outsourced to unaccountable figures behind the scenes. And the public was kept in the dark. Even Biden himself, we now know, was shielded from bad polling numbers. But the deeper lesson is more uncomfortable. Change comes whether you want it to or not. The US establishment tried to shut out the new generation. It only worked temporarily. Trump is back in power. Yes, he is old. But unlike Biden, he has surrounded himself with younger, dynamic figures who are already shaping the Republican Party’s future. The Democrats, by contrast, have learned nothing. Despite their crushing defeat in 2024, the old leadership continues to resist renewal. And now it’s costing them. Just recently, the Republicans passed Trump’s major tax bill in the House of Representatives by a single vote. That vote was lost because Democratic Congressman Gerry Connolly, aged 75, had passed away just before the session. He was the third Democrat to die in office this year. This morbid pattern hasn’t gone unnoticed. Americans have begun to joke grimly that the Democratic Party is literally dying. And the punchlines, as dark as they may be, contain more truth than fiction. Washington is starting to resemble Brezhnev’s Moscow – not just in age, but in inertia. In the end, the lesson isn’t about personalities. It’s about systems that refuse to adapt. Systems that cling to the past until the present falls apart. The ‘Washington Obkom’ may have seemed like a Russian jest once. It’s not a joke anymore.

    "title": "US women’s-only spa barred from excluding transwomen with penises",
    "article_text": "A federal appeals court has obliged a Korean spa in Lynnwood, Washington to provide services to transgender females. The beauty parlor had attempted to bar transwomen who have not undergone gender-affirming surgery from entering its ladies-only facilities. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled Thursday, in a 2–1 vote, that Olympus Spa must change its admissions policy to comply with the anti-discrimination law. The court found that the spa’s owners were not being deprived of their First Amendment rights, such as the right to free exercise of religion, freedom of speech and right of association, by the State of Washington’s requirement. Olympus Spa, which operates two locations in the state, is a traditional Korean bathhouse offering massages, body scrubs, and hot tubs that require full nudity. In 2020, the Washington State Human Rights Commission filed a complaint after a transgender woman—who had not undergone genital surgery—was denied entry. The Commission argued that the spa’s ladies-only policy violated the Washington Law Against Discrimination (WLAD), which prohibits discrimination in public accommodations based on gender identity and gender expression. In response, Olympus Spa filed a lawsuit claiming the state was violating the owners’ constitutional rights to freedom of religion, speech, and association. The spa, run by a Christian Korean-American family, cited religious and cultural beliefs in opposing the inclusion of individuals with male genitalia in female-only spaces where nudity is required. “The family-run business is owned by Korean Christians who hold sincere faith-based convictions against allowing persons whose genitals are external (males) to be present with persons whose genitals are internal (females) while in a state of partial or full undress if such persons are not married to one another,”the complaint stated. However, the Ninth Circuit ruled that enforcement of the state law does not violate the First Amendment. Writing for the majority, Judge Margaret McKeown said that providing a Korean body scrub or massage does not constitute protected expressive conduct. She added that accepting the spa’s argument would essentially make every gym or massage parlor exempt from nondiscrimination laws. The ruling comes amid broader national debates on transgender rights. Earlier this year, President Donald Trump reversed several protections for trans individuals, ending federal support for child sexual mutilation procedures and issuing executive orders banning transwomen from women’s sports and removing“radical gender ideology”from the military.",

    "title": "China hits back at US over vilification",
    "article_text": "Washington is“vilifying”Beijing, the Chinese foreign ministry said on Sunday. The accusation follows remarks made by US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who is deliberately ignoring calls for peace from nations in the region, according to the ministry. Earlier, Hegseth claimed that China poses a real and potentially imminent threat, and urged Washington’s allies in the Indo-Pacific region to increase defense and security spending. “Hegseth deliberately ignored the call for peace and development by countries in the region and instead touted a Cold War mentality of bloc confrontation, vilified China with defamatory allegations, and falsely labeled China a ‘threat’,”the ministry said in a statement. Speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore on Saturday, the defense secretary accused Chinese authorities of seeking to fundamentally alter the region’s status quo and aiming to“become a hegemonic power.”Hegseth also raised the issue of Taiwan, which relies on the US for its defense - accusing Beijing of preparing to invade the territory. The Chinese foreign ministry described the comments as“deplorable”and“intended to sow division”in the Asia-Pacific. It emphasized that the only country that“deserves to be called a hegemonic power”is the US, which it accused of undermining peace and stability in the region. Responding to Hegseth’s remarks on the self-governing island, the ministry reiterated that the issue is entirely China’s internal affair. It stressed that no foreign nation has the right to interfere and warned the US against using the Taiwan issue as leverage against Beijing. Taiwan has long been a source of discord between Beijing and Washington. While China advocates peaceful reunification, it has warned that any move toward formal independence could trigger armed conflict. Beijing contends that certain elements within the US government are pushing Taiwan toward that outcome. China has also repeatedly criticized US-led joint military drills in the Indo-Pacific, arguing that they destabilize the region and provoke tensions over Taiwan. In addition to geopolitical disputes, the two nations are at odds over trade. US President Donald Trump has blamed Beijing for America’s significant trade deficit with China. In May, both countries agreed to pause the tariff hikes introduced the previous month for 90 days, while maintaining a baseline 10% duty on mutual imports. Earlier this week, Trump accused China of violating that agreement.",

    "title": "Musk dismisses NYT drugs claim",
    "article_text": "Elon Musk has denied allegations of drug abuse following a New York Times report detailing his purported heavy use of controlled substances during Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign. On Friday, the NYT released an article alleging that the mogul was using the substances“far more intensely than previously known.” In a post on X on Saturday, Musk brushed off the allegations, writing:“Also, to be clear, I am NOT taking drugs! The New York Times was lying their ass off.” He added that he had“tried prescription ketamine a few years ago”and had publicly disclosed this fact.“This [is] not even news. It helps for getting out of dark mental holes, but haven’t taken it since then,”Musk stressed. The Times had alleged that Musk was taking so much ketamine that it was affecting his bladder, a known effect of chronic use. The article also claimed, citing sources familiar with the matter, that Musk took ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms and traveled with a daily medication box containing about 20 pills including the stimulant Adderall. The NYT stated that it is unclear whether Musk was taking drugs when he joined the Trump administration as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which was tasked with slashing the federal bureaucracy. However, it mentioned that during his tenure as a public servant, the businessman“exhibited erratic behavior,”insulted cabinet members, and at one point made a controversial gesture that many interpreted as a Nazi-style salute. On Thursday, Musk announced that he would no longer serve as a government employee. He thanked Trump“for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending”while stating that DOGE would continue its operations. While Trump noted that Musk“is really not leaving”and was“going to be back and forth,”the announcement came amid multiple reports of a rift between the mogul and administration officials. In March, the NYT reported that Musk had clashed with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio over firings in his department and with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy over air traffic control regulations. Musk also recently voiced disappointment over Trump’s spending bill, which he said would increase the deficit and undermine DOGE’s mission.",

Macron haddelivered a speechat the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore on Friday in which he rejected those who would frame the conflict as a purely European concern.“If we consider that Russia could be allowed to take a part of the territory of Ukraine without any restriction… What could happen in Taiwan?”he said. “Comparing the Taiwan question with the Ukraine issue is unacceptable. The two are different in nature, and not comparable at all,”the embassy said on Facebook on Saturday, reiterating that the issue of Taiwan is“entirely China’s internal affair.” Crimea voted to join Russia shortly after the 2014 US-backed coup in Kiev, and four other former Ukrainian regions did the same following referendums in 2022. Moscow has demanded that, for a viable peace deal, Ukraine must recognize Russia’s new borders and withdraw its troops from Russian territory. Taiwan has had a separate government since 1949, when nationalists retreated to the island after losing a war with the Communists in mainland China. Beijing maintains that it will achieve“national reunification”and has warned the authorities in Taipei against formally declaring independence. Only a handful of countries recognize Taiwan as an independent country, while most states, including the US and Russia, adhere to the ‘One-China’ principle. Nevertheless, multiple Western countries maintain informal ties with Taiwan.",

    "title": "Are the New York Knicks Actually Good? And, More Importantly, Are They Cool?",
    "article_text": "TheNew York Knicksare a very good basketball team. Pop the cork on that idea, pour yourself a glass, and marinate in all the unfamiliar tannins. For anyone under the age of 35, this is a hugely dizzying reality. The Knicks were a total abomination for most of the 21st century. It was not long ago thatKevin Knox, Damyean Dotson, and Noah Vonlehled the team in minutes played. Without the anonymity that a small market affords, the New York of it all also meant that the Knicks were embarrassing themselves very publicly. When they do that now, at least it happens three rounds into the postseason. Today, the franchise—and its “brand,” eyeroll required—are firmly entrenched near the top of theNBAagain. This season, the Knicks won 50 games for the second consecutive year, something that hadn’t happened since 1995. (During the leanest years of the not-so-distant past, there were times when these guys couldn’t crack 50 winstotalover two years.) More importantly, they made the Eastern Conference Finals this spring, something that even the most hating-ass naysayers should acknowledge as a major accomplishment. Despite losing to the Indiana Pacers in six frustrating games, there is no universe in which being one of the last four teams remaining in the NBA playoffs is a bad thing, no matter how much trouble they had getting past the upstartPistons, how many times Pacers scapegraceTyrese Haliburtonput them in a food processor, or which of theircompetitors got injuredon the way there. But now that the Knicks have officially been eliminated, the requisite offseason questions come charging toward them like so many ofKarl-Anthony Towns’ bull-like plows to the basket.What can the front office add to this roster in the offseason? Is head coach Tom Thibodeau the right guy to take the Knicks from playoff mainstay to actual title winners? Does Josh Hart move to the bench full-time?Off the court, there’s a lingering question that’s become fodder for the fans that judge the Knicks from every possible angle, not just by their basketball acumen. When it comes to the actual human beings who make up the New York Knicks—dudes who, respectfully, have powerful Murray Hill energy—it’s hard not to wonder: Are these guyscool? Over Memorial Day Weekend, with the Knicks very much still alive in their Conference Final cage match, writerOck Sportello published a blog postexamining a phenomenon he calls the NBA’s swag crisis. As it pertains to the Knicks, Sportello points to star player Jalen Brunson’s status as a coach’s son—and his affinity for Eminem—as things that would traditionally work against a person when determining their coolness. But, on the other hand, captaining the Knicks to the brink of the NBA Finals is objectively cool, and injecting a potent dose of steroids into New York’s collective basketball fandom is the kind of thing that earns you both a literal and figurative key to the city. (Or in Brunson’s case,a table at Carbonewhenever he wants.) Noah Kulwin, the writer, co-host of theBlowbackpodcast, and sanguine Knicks fan, doesn’t think Brunson’s aversion to getting a fit off means the ceiling is caving in. “Jalen Brunson is the captain of the Knicks. Jalen Brunson will forever be the coolest person to me on that simple level,” Kulwin said. Much likeNew York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, the truculent point guard might not possess the right kind of cool, but he’s the right guy for this particular moment. In the current NBA landscape, where a growing majority of players now come from upper-middle class upbringings, and spent their entire youths playing AAU ball, Kulwin thinks we’re seeing a homogeneity that’s draining the cool reservoir. “They come from more similar backgrounds than before. That background is not necessarily a crucible for interesting personality formation when combined with the amount of hours that you just have to spend putting a fucking ball in a hoop. These are things about athletes—and what makes athletes the kinds of people they are, that we know. But it's also, to me, about the risks that they're not allowed to take.” As anyone who’s ever been to a live sporting event knows, the game has become inextricable from the corporate entities who provide the funding. It’s not just the ads that litter the court, field, or ice—it’s the shoehorning of random companies into every available moment. A timeout is no longer just a timeout; it’s a timeout presented by MasterCard or Chipotle. The Knicks play every game with an ad for Abu Dhabi on one shoulder and an unmissable Nike Swoosh on the other. In Kulwin’s eyes, it’s all created a disconcerting merger of man and corporation. “If players were not constantly made to feel like they're part of the corporate [machine], if they were encouraged to be people, be fucking weird, say stuff…I don't think it's easily resolved,” Kulwin reasoned. “But the Knicks in particular, I think it's just a testament to how fucked they were for 25 years of sucking.” That’s the other thing. The Knicks were horrendous for so long, broke a seven-year playoff absence when Thibodeau was hired, and then ascended to the realm of Actual Team when Brunson came aboard prior to the 2022-23 season. The emotional whiplash of going from zero to hero has New Yorkers in a tizzy. No longer do they drive themselves to the psych ward because a 20-year-old prospect isn’t panning out. Instead, they drive themselves to the psych ward because the Knicks can’t get over a hump that used to seem thousands of miles away. “For 25 years,people in New York were delusionalthat Knicks basketball could ever be good,” Kulwin said. “Now that they’re one of the last four teams in the NBA playoffs, people are delusional about how much of a catastrophe it is. I think that's a beautiful thing, and I only hope that we have many more years of that kind of delusion coming in.” In an Icarian sense, the Knicks flew too close to the sun and their cutesy feel-good status melted. While chatting with Kulwin, I presented the idea that while these Knicks (as presently constructed) are the type of team that could regularly be in the Conference Finals, that doesn’t mean that each passing year without a championship banner is some sort of failure. The failure would come from losing the eternal battle withNew Yorkers. If the Knicks maintain their place as one of the league’s best teams, but keep bowing out from the playoffs in winnable series, New York City’s concerns about the Knicks’ validity will only grow louder and louder. The city will never abandon the team, of course, but they’ll absolutely see through any sort of fabricated attempts at big dog authenticity. Think about how many times you’ve overheard someone theorize—even though their acquisitions changed the entire tenor of the Eastern Conference—that Towns is too soft, or that Mikal Bridges doesn’t get to the free-throw line enough, and then multiply that by infinity. The current version of the squad is defined by great team chemistry and what seems to be a genuine sense of love for one another. But will the path to salvation eventually have to include a personality overhaul? “It's so disorienting to have a team this good and this exciting,” Kulwin began. “But for the New York Knicks to have personalities on the court who, as players, are so exciting, and then for them to just be complete non-entities beyond that, it’s pretty puzzling.” While it may seem counterintuitive to look tobaseball—the sport where outsized personalities are fewest and furthest between—Kulwin pinpoints one of the Knicks’ neighbors as a modern athlete who’s cracked the coolness equation, albeit with a much different set of circumstances. “The person who I think of who's cool or who's interesting and sophisticated as an athlete isFrancisco Lindor.” Kulwin stated. “He cares a lot about his wife. He cares a lot about proving to everybody that,I'm just fucking good at this shit, dude. Part of why Lindor has that freedom, I think, is because the baseball season is longer, individual games and performances are way less scrutinized.” So, what is there to do? The Knicks cannot, should not, and will not blow it up. The Brunson-Towns-Bridges core has only played one year together, and definitely have room for improvement in both the regular and postseason. But a leaguewide metamorphosis is upon us, and has been for years. The Knicks can run it back with their fraternal group of millennials all they want, but as therunaway train in Oklahoma Cityhas proved, the younger basketball-watching crowd have a new crop of exemplars. “Thestars hitting their primes now, they'resolidly Gen Z,” Kulwin identified. “Maybe Zoomers would want to hang out with them. I don't know.”",

Since then, Caitlin Clark has headed to Indy's Gainbridge Fieldhouse even when she's off the clock, forevents like the final US stopsinTaylor Swift's Eras Tour. But with the Fever off until Tuesday, Clark was free to attend Saturday's historic matchup between the Pacers and the Knicks, where she sat alongside teammatesAliyah BostonandLexie Hull. Aliyah Boston #7, Lexie Hull #10 and Caitlin Clark #22 of the Indiana Fever celebrate during the game between the New York Knicks and the Indiana Pacers during Game 6 of the 2025 Eastern Conference Finals on May 31, 2025 at Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, Indiana. Clark wasn't the only famous Pacers fan in attendance last night, which saw the Pacers head to the NBA finals for the first time in 25 years. Indianapolis-born and raisedactorMike Eppswas also there, as he's been for much of the season. Mike Epps attends the game between the New York Knicks and the Indiana Pacers during Game 6 of the 2025 Eastern Conference Finals on May 31, 2025 at Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, Indiana. Absent in the stands wasJohn Mellencamp, who many of his fellow Hoosiers still refer to as “John Cougar.” The musician has been a staple at playoff games, but fan behavior at Game 4 left a bad taste in his mouth. In a post to social media last week, hechided his fellow fansfor booing Knicks supporters. “I was embarrassed when somebody, under whose direction I don’t know, called out some of the people who had made the trip from New York to support their team \u0000– and in turn, support our team,” Mellencamp wrote. “The audience booed these people. I’d say that was not Hoosier Hospitality. One could only say it’s poor, poor sportsmanship. I was not proud to be a Hoosier, and I’ve lived here my entire life.” A reference, one assumes, toPat McAfee, a former player with the Indianapolis Colts who later turned to sports commentary and professional wrestling. Accordingto USA TODAY, during Game 4 in the series, McAfee urged the crowd to shout at Knicks faithfulsTimothée Chalamet,Spike Lee, andBen Stiller, all of whomhad traveled to Indianafor the matchup. Timothee Chalamet and Kylie Jenner attend Game Six of the Eastern Conference Finals of the 2025 NBA Playoffs between the New York Knicks and the Indiana Pacers at Gainbridge Fieldhouse on May 31, 2025 in Indianapolis, Indiana. Unswayed by scofflaw Indiana fans, Chalamet returned to Indianapolis Saturday, with girlfriendKylie Jennerat his side. As the game began, his sunglassed visage was impassive, but as the night went on, the glasses came off, then went back on again…perhaps to cover his tears of disappointment at the team's loss. Timothee Chalamet and Kylie Jenner look on during the fourth quarter Game Six of the Eastern Conference Finals of the 2025 NBA Playoffs between the New York Knicks and the Indiana Pacers at Gainbridge Fieldhouse on May 31, 2025 in Indianapolis, Indiana. Others—perhaps dissuaded by unpleasant Indiana fans or Freeman's reminder that they need not be in the state—were notably absent. Lee, adie-hard Knicks fanwho has bounced betweenCannes and courtsfor much of the post-season, did not appear to attend the game in person. He did, however, publish an Instagram post that suggested he'dprefer to watchthe teams play in New York. (A message to Lee's reps to confirm his absence was not responded to as of publication time.)

    "title": "“They’re Behaving Like Fascists”: Rep. Jerry Nadler Denounces DHS After Aide Is Detained, Handcuffed",
    "article_text": "An aide to US RepresentativeJerry Nadler(D-NY) was handcuffed and briefly detained by Department of Homeland Security police in his Manhattan office on Wednesday. The video of the incident, first shared andreportedon by Gothamist’sArya Sundaramon Friday, shows DHS officers entering Nadler’s district office and accusing staff members of “harboring rioters.” An aide, whose face was blurred out, is crying while being handcuffed. According toRobert Gottheim, Nadler’s chief of staff, whospokewithThe New York Times, the federal agents were angry because the congressman’s team had seen the officers detaining migrants in the building—Nadler’s office is one floor above a federal immigration court—and because his staff had invited advocates who had also witnessed the detentions into the representative’s office. The aide was not arrested and not charged with a crime, both Nadler's office and a DHS spokesperson confirmed to Gothamist. “The Trump administration is trying to intimidate members of Congress,” Nadler told theTimesin an interview on Saturday. “They’re behaving like fascists.” PresidentDonald Trumpand his administration are using “totalitarian or even authoritarian practices” Nadler said. “We have to fight them. We don’t want to be a fascist country.” The DHS statement on Thursday made no mention of Nadler’s team “harboring rioters,” as the agents claimed the day before. Instead, according to the statement, the agents entered Nadler’s office because they had been told that protesters were there and were concerned for the safety of his staff members. Two immigration advocates present at the time, who asked Gothamist to remain anonymous, said that they were at the courthouse advising migrants as plainclothes ICE officers were questioning people there for court appearances. The advocates say they were threatened with arrest for loitering by the officers and were then invited, along with another advocate, to Nadler’s office by his staff. In the video, a staff member who was not detained is standing in a doorway and asks one of the agents to show her a warrant. The agent claims the officers do not need a warrant and walks past her. Another officer, the one handcuffing the aide, is heard telling her not to resist. The aide is heard asking officers, “What’s your problem?” adding, “they’re here for a meeting. They’re constituents.” This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Protests against immigration enforcement happened throughout the day. Hours after the confrontation inside Nadler’s office, police arrested nearly two dozen demonstrators they allege blocked traffic outside the building, an NYPD spokesperson said, according to Gothamist’s reporting. Trump’scampaignagainst migrants—including thosewith documentationand those without—has been a defining part of his second run for office and first several months as president. His administration has instructed immigration officers to arrest people immediately after a judge has ordered them to be deported or after prosecutors move to drop their cases—a directive made possible after Trumprescindedpolicies which did not allow ICE to conduct enforcement operations at or near courthouses or in “sensitive” areas, like schools and churches. Last month, also in New York City, a 20-year-old Bronx public school student wasdetainedby federal immigration officers after his asylum case was dismissed by a judge. ICE agents were waiting outside to detain Dylan, the first known city public school student to be detained by immigration enforcement. He’s sincesuedthe Trump administrationusinga “habeas corpus”petition. And, earlier in May, federal prosecutorschargedNewark MayorRas Barakawith trespassing after agents arrested him outside the fence of the Delaney Hall detention center—an incident that quickly went viral and sparked intense backlash andprotests. RepresentativeLaMonica McIverof New Jersey, who was also at the detention center seeking information from immigration officials, has beenchargedwith assault. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Following the reporting this week of his aide being handcuffed in his downtown office, Nadler wrote in astatementthat Trump and DHS are “sowing chaos in our communities, using intimidation tactics against both citizens and non-citizens in a reckless and dangerous matter.” Nadler said that DHS’s decision to enter a congressional office and detain a staff member shows a “deeply troubling disregard” for “proper legal boundaries.” “If this can happen in a Member of Congress’s office,” the statement reads, “it can happen to anyone—and it is happening.” The Dizzying Rise of MAHA WarriorCalley Means, RFK Jr.’s Right-Hand Man The UnsinkableKathy Bates From RFK Jr. to Patrick Schwarzenegger, a Brief Guide tothe Kennedy Family Why Is Trump Pardoning  thisReality TV CoupleConvicted of Fraud?

    "title": "Patti LuPone Extends “Sincere Apologies” For Comments About Fellow Broadway Stars",
    "article_text": "ActorPatti LuPoneis known for her outspoken and unfiltered perspective, with public pot shots at celebritiessuch asMadonnaandKim Kardashianboosting her name recognition beyond heraward-winning turnson Broadway. But after her latest comments spurred outrage from her peers, LuPone appears to be reassessing her position, beginning with an apology for remarks she made in a recent interview. A hero to many forher response totexting theatergoers alone, some of theAgatha All Alongactor’s support took a hit last fall. That's when Patti LuPone’s complaints about a sound bleed fromAlicia KeysmusicalHell’s Kitcheninto a neighboring theater where LuPone was performing tumbled over into social media. Inan Instagram post,Hell’s Kitchen's Tony-winning starKecia Lewistook LuPone to task over how the shared-walls situation was handled, saying her actions were “bullying; they’re offensive; they’re racially microaggressive; they’re rude; they’re rooted in privilege, and these actions also lack a sense of community and leadership for someone as yourself who has been in the business as long as you have.” Lauded Broadway artistAudra McDonald, a longtime colleague of LuPone's, expressed her support for the post via comment-posted emoji. American actress and singer Patti LuPone in a studio to work on the original Broadway cast recording of 'Evita', April 3, 1979. Inan interviewwithThe New Yorkerpublished last week, reporterMichael Schulmanbrought up the dispute. LuPone's response was unsparing. “Oh, my God,” she began. “Here’s the problem. She calls herself a veteran? Let’s find out how many Broadway shows Kecia Lewis has done, because she doesn’t know what the fuck she’s talking about … She’s done seven. I’ve done thirty-one. Don’t call yourself a vet, bitch.” (Playbill notesthat Lewis, who is 59, has performed in 10 Broadway productions. The 76-year-old LuPone has appeared in 28.) When asked about McDonald's emoji support, LuPone responded, “Exactly. And I thought,you should know better. That’s typical of Audra. She’s not a friend.” When Schulman followed up with a question about McDonald’s ongoing role inGypsy, he writes that LuPone \"stared at me, in silence, for fifteen seconds. Then she turned to the window and sighed, ‘What a beautiful day.’” Patti LuPone performs onstage at the 66th Annual Tony Awards at The Beacon Theatre on June 10, 2012 in New York City. The quotesprompted an open lettersigned by over 600 artists and creatives, including McDonald,Wendell Pierce, andCourtney Love. Addressed to the American Theatre Wing and the Broadway League, thenote called onthe groups, which organize the Tony Awards, to ban LuPone and other alleged offenders from all industry events. “Individuals, including Patti Lupone, who use their platform to publicly demean, harass, or disparage fellow artists—particularly with racial, gendered, or otherwise violent language—should not be welcomed,\" the letter reads. “This is about more than one person. It is about a culture. A pattern. A persistent failure to hold people accountable for violent, disrespectful, or harmful behavior—especially when they are powerful or well-known.” The letter was made public on Friday. On Saturday, LuPone issued an uncharacteristically conciliatory response,also via Instagram. In simple white text over a grey box, the post reads, “For as long as I have worked in the theatre, I have spoken my mind and never apologized. That is changing today.” “I am deeply sorry for the words I used duringThe New Yorkerinterview, particularly about Kecia Lewis, which were demeaning and disrespectful,\" the statement continues. “I regret my flippant and emotional responses during this interview, which were inappropriate, and I am devastated that my behavior has offended others and has run counter to what we hold dear in this community. I hope to have the chance to speak to Audra and Kecia personally to offer my sincere apologies.” In the statement, LuPone says, “I wholeheartedly agree with everything that was written in the open letter shared yesterday. From middle school drama clubs to professional stages, theatre has always been about lifting each other up and welcoming those who feel they don’t belong anywhere else. I made a mistake, I take full responsibility for it, and I am committed to making this right. Our entire theatre community deserves better.” Neither Lewis, McDonald, nor the authors of the letter have publicly responded to LuPone’s statement at the time of publication.

    "article_text": "Centre for Food Safety orders removal of Haribo Happy Cola F!ZZ sweets from shelves as precautionary measure after Taiwan suspends imports Hong Kong’s food safety watchdog has told businesses to temporarily remove a cola-flavoured Haribo product from their shelves as a precautionary measure, following the discovery of cannabis in a batch of the popular sweets in the Netherlands and an import suspension by Taiwan. In a reply to the Post, a government spokesman said on Sunday that the Centre for Food Safety was taking action due to the findings overseas, despite no local reports of illness linked to the Haribo Happy Cola F!ZZ sweets. “There have been no reports of discomfort among residents in Hong Kong from consuming the cola-flavoured gummies,” the statement said. “However, in response to foreign reports and as a precautionary measure, the Centre for Food Safety of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department has assisted in notifying the industry to temporarily remove the brand’s gummies from shelves.” The centre said stores were advised to remove “all the products (disregard of batches) of the relevant brand temporarily”. Authorities declined to clarify whether the recall affected all types of Haribo products. The government said it would conduct tests on the recalled gummies and continue to monitor the situation. “If any problems are found, corresponding actions will be taken and announcements will be made,” the spokesman added.",
