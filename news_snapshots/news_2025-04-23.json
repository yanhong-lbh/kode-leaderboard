Earlier this month, a women's pool tournament championship in the United Kingdom featuredtwo transgender athleteswho defeated their female competition. Harriet Haynes and Lucy Smithwent toe-to-toe in the Ultimate Pool Women's Pro Series Event 2 at Robin Park Leisure Centre in Wigan. Both competitors defeated four female opponents each to get to the championship bout. But weeks after the event, the organization has barred biological males from competing against women.

According toUltimate Pool Group, Smith won 85 of 113 matches and 62% of 848 frames dating back to 2021 before entering the final. Haynes owned a .750 winning percentage in 241 lifetime matches and won 61% of the frames before taking on Smith. The two players wound up facing each other in the semifinals of the U.K. Mini Series pool championships in October. Haynes won that matchup but lost the championship to a biological woman. In August 2023, the World Eightball Pool Federation (WEPF) announced it was updating its guidelines to only allow those who were \"born female\" to play the sport.

We want to emphasize that our commitment to upholding the values of sportsmanship, inclusivity, and adherence to regulatory standards remains unwavering,\" the WEPF said at the time. \"Our ultimate goal is to ensure the continued growth and development of the sport we all love, while maintaining a harmonious balance between inclusivity and the integrity of competition. We recognize the importance of fostering an environment where everyone can participate and thrive, and we remain dedicated to upholding these principles to the best of our ability.\" But in October that year,the WEPFreversedthat protection. It allowed transgender competitors under the condition that they identified as female for a minimum of four years and submitted proof of lowered testosterone levels. However, Ultimate Pool also said that their decision came as the U.K. Supreme Court defined the word \"woman\" under its biological meaning, rather than gender ideology. \"In this judgment the Supreme Court ruled that a Gender Recognition Certificate does not change a person’s legal sex for the purposes of the Equality Act 2010,\" the new Ultimate Pool guidelines say.

    "title": "Trump signs education-focused executive orders on AI, school discipline, accreditation, foreign gifts and more",
    "article_text": "Former Education Secretary Bill Bennett discusses the Supreme Court case that will evaluate parents' rights to opt out of classes where LGBTQ books are being used in the curriculum on 'The Story.' PresidentDonald Trumpsigned multiple Executive Orders relating to education Wednesday afternoon, with several tied to the theme of returning meritocracy back to the education system. The orders, seven in total, included actions to integrate artificial intelligence into K-12 school curricula, reforms to school discipline and accreditation guidelines, requirements related to the disclosure of foreign funding to schools and enhancements to the country's workforce development programs. Trump's slew of education-focused orders also included another directive demanding an end to DEI ideology in schools, specifically the use of \"disparate impact theory,\" on top of his previous executive order from January ordering an end to DEI-like programming and ideology in K-12 schools. An Executive Order setting up aWhite Houseinitiative supporting the efficiency and effectiveness of Historically Black Colleges and Universities was also signed by the president on Wednesday. EDUCATION DEPARTMENT TO RESUME COLLECTIONS ON DEFAULTED FEDERAL STUDENT LOANS FOR FIRST TIME SINCE 2020 President Donald Trump holds an executive order relating to education in the Oval Office of the White House, Wednesday, April 23, 2025, in Washington, as Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer and Education Secretary Linda McMahon watch.(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) \"They're allowing people into school – they can't do math – and yet kids who have worked really hard and are number one in their class out of high school – some place in New Jersey or Mississippi – they can't get into the best schools,\" Trump said as he signed his order implementing new school accreditation requirements. \"What is that all about?\" \"I think that gets to your policy, sir, of meritocracy – that we should be looking at those who have real merit to get in,\" Department of Education SecretaryLinda McMahon,who was standing over Trump's shoulder as he signed, chimed in. \"And we have to look harder at those universities that aren't enforcing that.\" The accreditation reforms, along with the president's Executive Orders on school discipline and \"disparate impact theory,\" were all connected to pulling back from the Biden administration's era of prioritizing DEI over meritocracy. Specifically, the accreditation reforms seek to prevent accreditors from imposing \"discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)-based standards,\" while compelling them to \"prioritize student outcomes.\" ‘THIS IS INDOCTRINATION, NOT EDUCATION': PLAINTIFF IN SCOTUS CASE SLAMS SCHOOLS FOR FORCING LGBTQ+ CURRICULUM Meanwhile, under the Biden administration, theDepartment of Educationreleased student discipline guidance contending that persistent racism clouds school disciplinary systems. Trump's Wednesday Executive Order rescinds that guidance. President Donald Trump has been a staunch opponent to what he describes as \"discriminatory\" diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs across the United States.(Getty Images) \"Under, I believe it was theBiden administration– first Obama and then Biden – the Department of Justice issued guidance that made it almost impossible for schools to enforce adequate disciplinary policies,\" Trump's executive assistant Will Scharf said of the order as Trump was signing it. \"Basically they focused on CRT and diversity ideology, instead of actually just enforcing the rules in classrooms to ensure a safe learning environment.\" The prohibition of \"disparate impact theory\" builds on the president's past orders on ridding \"discriminatory\" DEI programs and influences from educational settings. \"This is a theory that underlies a lot of the modern DEI and CRT-driven diversity culture,\" Scharf explained. \"The basic idea is instructing your department and agencies to no longer rely on disparate impact theory as they're regulating, as they're issuing guidance, as they're making rules. We want to focus on results, we want to focus on actual fairness, we want to focus on merit, not things like disparate impact theory and the whole sort-of diversity, equity and inclusion cult.\" TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ASKS SCOTUS TO APPROVE DEI-RELATED EDUCATION CUTS President Donald Trump signs an executive order relating to education in the Oval Office of the White House, Wednesday, April 23, 2025, in Washington.(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) Besides focusing on returning meritocracy to the education system, the president's Executive Orders also sought to modernize American education and workforce preparation through the implementation of AI education in schools and through a commitment to add 1 million new apprenticeships. The AI order,Trump's latest pro-AI measure,established a White House task force for AI and education that will work with federal agencies and the private sector to help draft AI programs for schools.

    "article_text": "'Common Sense' Department: In a surprising turn of events, the National Republican Congressional Committee is footing the bill for four more Democratic congress members to visit their latest star, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, in El Salvador. The so-called deported \"Maryland man\"Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whom Democrats have been demanding the Trump administration return to the U.S., was previously pulled over by a highway patrol officer while driving a car belonging to a confessed human smuggler, multiple sources in DHS confirmed to Fox News Digital. The sources confirmed documents reported byJust the Newsthat revealed Abrego Garcia was pulled over driving an SUV belonging to Jose Ramon Hernandez Reyes, another illegal alien who in 2020 confessed to human smuggling across the U.S.-Mexico border. As previously reported by Fox News Digital, Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old illegal alien whom theTrump administrationrecently deported back to El Salvador, was pulled over on Dec. 1, 2022, by a Tennessee Highway Patrol trooper who stopped him after he was \"observed speeding\" and unable to stay in his lane. The trooper noticed eight individuals in the car with Abrego Garcia, who said he began driving three days prior from Houston, Texas, to Temple Hills, Maryland, via St. Louis, Missouri, to \"perform construction work.\" The report on the stop states that the trooper suspected it was a human trafficking incident, as there was no luggage in the vehicle. Additionally, the individuals in the car reportedly gave the same address as Abrego Garcia's home address.

New documents further reveal that Abrego Garcia was driving a black 2001 Chevrolet Suburban that he said belonged to his \"boss.\" The Suburban was identified by DHS as belonging to Hernandez Reyes, who pleaded guilty to human smuggling after being caught in Mississippi in a car with passengers from Mexico, El Salvador and Honduras. According to another document also confirmed by DHS sources, the Homeland Security Investigations Baltimore field office further flagged the vehicle being driven by Abrego Garcia as belonging to a target they suspected of human trafficking or smuggling.

A federal immigration court in Baltimore further determined Abrego Garcia was not eligible for release because he \"failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that his release from custody would not pose a danger to others, as the evidence shows that he is a verified member of MS-13.\" The court held that \"the fact that a ‘past, proven, and reliable source of infonnation [sic]’ verified the Respondent's gang membership, rank, and gang name is sufficient to support that the Respondent is a gang member\" and that Abrego had \"failed to present evidence to rebut that assertion.\" Court records involving Abrego Garcia’s wife, Jennifer Vasquez, have further shown that he is a \"violent\" repeat wife-beater.

He’s a man of great integrity. We will always be grateful to him for his wisdom, his guidance and above all, his friendship,\" Dickerson said. \"And we cannot thank him enough,\" DuBois added. CBS News did not immediately respond toFox News Digital's request for comment. TOP '60 MINUTES' PRODUCER RESIGNS FROM SHOW, CITES LACK OF INDEPENDENCE \"60 Minutes\" executive producer Bill Owens abruptly left the program, claiming he could no longer make independent decisions at CBS.(Piaras Ó Mídheach/Sportsfile for Collision via Getty Images) Trump is seeking $20 billion in a lawsuit against CBS, alleging election interference over its handling of a \"60 Minutes\" interview last year with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. The president accused CBS of aiding his 2024 Democratic opponent through deceptive editing just weeks before the presidential election. CBS’ parent company, Paramount Global, agreed to mediation, signaling their courtroom feud will result in a settlement. Owens announced to his colleagues on Tuesday he's removing himself from the newsroom drama. \"Over the past months, it has also become clear that I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it. To make independent decisions based on what was right for 60 Minutes, right for the audience,\" Owens wrote in a memo obtained by Fox News Digital. \"So, having defended this show — and what we stand for — from every angle, over time with everything I could, I am stepping aside so the show can move forward.\" \"The show is too important to the country, it has to continue, just not with me as the Executive Producer,\" he said. TRUMP, CBS PARENT COMPANY SET FOR MEDIATION IN $20 BILLION ‘60 MINUTES’ LAWSUIT It has been previously reported that Shari Redstone, Paramount’s controlling shareholder, has been in favor of settling Trump's lawsuit in order to help clear the path for Paramount's merger with Skydance. Owens expressed concern about a recent uptick in oversight from CBS executives during an internal meeting on Tuesday when informing staffers of his abrupt exit, according toThe New York Times. Leading up to his exit, Redstonereportedly \"kept tabs\"on which upcoming \"60 Minutes\" segments were about Trump. While a spokesperson for Redstone told Semafor neither she nor Paramount sought to kill stories, one source told Semafor that Redstone had been privately and publicly critical of \"60 Minutes\" in recent months. Shari Redstone, the controlling shareholder of CBS News' parent company Paramount, reportedly wants to settle Trump's lawsuit in order for the company's planned merger with Skydance Media to move forward.(Getty Images) The lawsuit stems from an exchange Harris had with \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Bill Whitaker, who asked her why Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn't \"listening\" to the Biden administration. Harris was widely mockedfor the \"word salad\" answer that aired in a preview clip of the interview on \"Face the Nation.\" However, when Whitaker asked the same question during the primetime special, Harris had a different, more concise response. Critics at the time accused CBS News of editing Harris' \"word salad\" answer to shield the then-vice president from further backlash leading up to Election Day. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Earlier this year, FCC ChairBrendan Carrordered CBS News to hand over the unedited transcript of the interview as part of its investigation into whether the network violated the FCC's \"news distortion\" policy after a complaint was filed. CBS had refused to release the unedited transcript when the controversy first began. The released raw transcript and footage showed that both sets of Harris' comments came from the same response, but CBS News had aired only the first half of her response in the \"Face the Nation\" preview clip and aired the second half during the primetime special.

    "title": "Falcons say Kirk Cousins participating in voluntary offseason program was unsurprising, despite trade rumors",
    "article_text": "The Atlanta Falcons GM expects to keep Kirk Cousins on the team in 2025 despite him being benched for Michael Penix Jr. earlier last season. Kirk Cousins' run with the Minnesota Vikings came to an end just over a year ago. The veteran quarterback signed a four-year contract with the Atlanta Falcons last March. The status of Cousins remains a backdrop to the Falcons' plans for Thursday'sNFL Draft. The veteran signal caller left some observers surprised when he reported for the first day of the team's voluntary offseason program. But,Falcons general manager Terry Fontenotsaid he was not among the group who were surprised by Cousins' appearance. \"I wouldn’t say a surprise,\" Fontenot said. \"This is a voluntary thing. Whether a player comes or doesn’t come, we have a lot of good professionals who we know are going to take care of their bodies, including Kirk.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Atlanta Falcons quarterback Kirk Cousins (18) enters the field before the game against the Minnesota Vikings at U.S. Bank Stadium.(Jeffrey Becker/Imagn Images) Cousins' arrival in Atlanta last offseason presented him another opportunity to start, but his time as the Falcons' starter was ultimately short-lived. After a string of interception-riddled performances, theFalcons benched Cousinsin December in favor of then-rookie Michael Penix Jr. Cousins remained the backup for the final three games of the season, with many believing he had taken his last snap in a Falcons uniform. KIRK COUSINS, JOE BURROW, JARED GOFF ANNOUNCED FOR NEW SEASON OF NETFLIX'S 'QUARTERBACK' SERIES Since the end of the regular season, the Falconsattempts to trade Cousinsto another franchise have proven unsuccessful. Atlanta has been reluctant to release the quarterback, likely due to the financial implications. Cousins' salary for the upcoming season is fully guaranteed. Atlanta Falcons quarterback Kirk Cousins (18) prepares for a game against the New York Giants at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.(Brett Davis-Imagn Images) Fontenot has said the team is comfortable having Cousins remain with the team as the backup for the 2025 season. Falcons head coach Raheem Morris echoed similar sentiments at the recent NFL meetings in Florida, saying the team still feels \"very strongly about Kirk being our backup quarterback.\" General manager Terry Fontenot of the Atlanta Falcons speaks to the media during the NFL Combine at the Indiana Convention Center on February 27, 2024 in Indianapolis, Indiana.(Stacy Revere/Getty Images) Morris also acknowledged Cousins would like an opportunity to start, even if for another team. \"We won’t hold him back if opportunity presents itself,\" Morris said. \"He's made it clear he’d like to be a starter.\" Earlier this month, Falcons owner Arthur Blank confirmed he had an hour-long discussion with Cousins about his standing with the team. \"I took five pages of notes, literally five pages of notes,\"Blank said. \"It could not have been a more cordial and more respectful conversation.\" WSB-TV was the first to report Cousins' participation in the Falcons' offseason activity. His participation comes amid a report from The Athletic's Senior NFL Insider, Dianna Russini, which stated at least three NFL teams have interest in acquiring Cousins. Russini listedthe Steelers, Browns, and Vikings as the clubs Cousins could potentially land with. Per the terms of his contract, Cousins would have to give his approval before any trade he's involved in becomes official. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP A trade for Cousins could materialize at some point during the draft, per the report. \"It’s believed that Cousins would be against any trade that involves sending him to a situation involving a young QB, similar to the situation he faced in Atlanta last year. If a trade were to happen, I’d expect it to go down on Saturday,\" Russini wrote. Fontenot said his priority remains with trying to improve the Falcons roster. \"We’re going to do what’s best for this football team, whether that’s a trade or whatever it is,\" Fontenot said when asked about his interest in trading Cousins. The Falcons currently hold the No. 15 pick in the draft. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

    "title": "New England serial killer fears heighten after eighth idyllic town rocked by gruesome discovery",
    "article_text": "Peter Valentin, chair of the Forensic Science Department at the University of New Haven's Henry C. Lee College of Criminal Justice and Forensic Sciences, says remains found across three New England states over two months strikes him as \"curious.\" Massachusetts authorities are investigating the death of a woman found unresponsive off abike path in Springfieldon Tuesday. Springfield Police Departmentspokesperson Ryan Walsh said officers responded to reports of an unresponsive person near a bike path at the 1500 block of Hall of Fame Avenue. Upon arrival, officers discovered a woman who was pronounced dead shortly after. \"The SPD Homicide Unit under the direction Captain Trent Duda is conducting an unattended death investigation in conjunction with the @HampdenDA Murder Unit, pending an autopsy by the Medical Examiner,\" Walsh said. NEW ENGLAND SERIAL KILLER: CT RIVER VALLEY SURVIVOR STABBED 27 TIMES WARNS LOCALS TO REMAIN ‘VIGILANT’ Downtown main street of Springfield, Massachusetts, USA(iStock) The woman's death comes amid rumors circulating online about a possible New England serial killer following the deaths of seven and now eight people, mostly women, between March and April in Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island. As of Wednesday, authorities have not announced any kind of connection between the eight victims' deaths. Walsh told Fox News Digital that the woman's cause of death will be determined by a medical examiner, and added that \"internet rumors are just that.\" The rumors began circulating on a Facebook group called \"New England Serial Killer,\" which has since changed its name due to Facebook rules and regulations. Over the last two months, human remains have been located in New Haven, Norwalk, Groton and Killingly, Connecticut; Foster, Rhode Island; and Framingham,Plymouth and now Springfield, Massachusetts.Some social media users say these discoveries of human remains — particularly, female remains — across the three neighboring states may indicate a serial killer. One set of the human remains was found in Groton, Connecticut.(iStock) But Connecticut State Police told Fox News Digital last week that \"there is no information at this time suggesting any connection to similar remains discoveries, and there is also no known threat to the public at this time,\" regarding the deaths in Connecticut. Peter Valentin, chair of the Forensic Science Department at the University of New Haven's Henry C. Lee College of Criminal Justice and Forensic Sciences, told Fox News Digital the fact that police responded to reports of an unresponsive person \"is strongly suggestive of someone who did not have any post-mortem artifacts that would negate the need to check for vital signs needed to make a pronouncement.\" NEW ENGLAND SERIAL KILLER FEARS MERIT ‘REVIEW AND INVESTIGATION’ AFTER REMAINS FOUND ACROSS 3 STATES: EXPERT A 35-year-old missing woman's remains were found in a swiftly moving Norwalk River after heavy rainfall the night before.(iStock) \"If someone is in full rigor mortis, there is no need to try to find a pulse because the presence of rigor mortis means they are unequivocally dead. So this is a very recent death, unlike the others that are being attributed to the [New England serial killer,\" Valentin said. While some of the remains found across the three New England states over the last two months were intact bodies that have been identified, others were degraded to the point that it will take time for authorities to identify who the victims were. In other words, while the remains were located over the span of two months, that does not indicate the victims died around the same time. NEW ENGLAND SERIAL KILLER FEARS GROW AS POLICE DOWNPLAY THREAT ENCROACHING ON WEALTHY COASTAL ENCLAVES Valentin noted that Springfield police have not yet determined whether the woman's death was a homicide. A woman was found dead near a Springfield, Massachusetts, bike path on April 22.(John Greim/LightRocket ) \"I am curious about what was recovered around the body,\" he said. \"There might have been paraphernalia suggestive of activity that is deemphasizing homicide (perhaps incorrectly) to the investigators because that article is quite tepid. It is filled with very cautious language (surely taken right from police press releases), which might be intentional to not feed into what is now turning into intense scrutiny over every suspicious death in New England.\" At least four of the victims in these eight  cases — two in Connecticut, one in Rhode Island and now one in Massachusetts — have been identified as women. Police also believe the victim found in Killingly, Connecticut, was a woman in her 40s to 60s, though her identity has not been confirmed.

    "article_text": "Admiral William McRaven (Ret) joined Brian Kilmeade to explain the ramifications in the Middle East if Iran gets a nuclear weapon. Plus, McRaven on his new book, 'Conquering Crisis: Ten Lessons to Learn Before You Need Them.' Much remains unknown regarding the progress of Washington’snuclear talks with Iran, but the head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said the international community must \"trust but verify\" that Tehran is engaging in good-faith negotiations. The U.S. and Iran are set to hold a thirdround of discussionson Saturday, which will deal with the technical aspects of Iran's nuclear program, as well as political negotiations, according to reports. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi has applauded the U.S.-Iran negotiations mediated by Oman, but said the top nuclear agency has not yet been asked to assist in the negotiations, though he has been in communication with Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff.

Of course, there are parallel processes. \"We have to keep our eyes on the ball. We must avoid Iran or prevent Iran from getting weapons. This is the objective.\" Grossi said that from the perspective of not only the top nuclear agency, but from world leaders he has been in communication with, there is a \"degree of expectation\" that after the political agreements are hashed out between Washington and Tehran, it will be the IAEA that makes the nuclear terms \"credible\" and \"verifiable.\" \"They all are expecting the IAEA to step in at the right time,\" he said. \"We are at their service to support, to make this thing credible. In a certain sense, they may have a political agreement, but then we have to make it verifiable.\" IRAN’S LONG TRAIL OF DECEPTION FUELS SKEPTICISM OVER NEW NUCLEAR DEAL AS TALKS CONTINUE An Iranian newspaper with a cover photo of Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff is seen in Tehran, Iran, on April 12.(Majid Asgaripour/WANA (West Asia News Agency) via Reuters) Fox News Digital obtained a copy of an address Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi — who traveled to China on Wednesday to reportedly discuss progress in the nuclear negotiations — was set to give at the Carnegie International Nuclear Policy Conference, though he never delivered the address due to format change requests by Tehran that were denied by the host. But in his address, he was set to position Iran as a proponent of nuclear non-proliferation and said Iran’s position had been \"mischaracterized.\" Since the U.S.’ withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which Tehran has argued made the deal mute, Iran has significantly advanced its programs by stockpiling near-weapons-grade-enriched uranium to levels that, if further enriched, could producefive nuclear warheads, as well as its centrifuges and missile capabilities. When asked by Fox News Digital if Grossi assessed the Islamic Republic’s position to be honest, he said, \"Trust, but verify. We need to verify.\" \"We are inspectors — that's the only way we build trust,\" he added. Grossi said the administration needs to identify what the end goals of this latest deal will be, as the framework of the JCPOA — widely criticized by Trump — is now very dated due to the advancements Iran has made.

    "article_text": "Former State Department deputy special envoy Ellie Cohanim joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss the effort to reach peace in Ukraine and dismantle Iran's nuclear program as negotiations continue. PresidentDonald Trumpthis week said he is \"very\" optimistic that Ukraine and Russia will enter into some sort of deal in the coming days, but security experts are still sounding the alarm that Russian President Vladimir Putin does not want peace. A feeling of geopolitical whiplash is surrounding Washington after the Trump administration last week said it wouldabandon peace effortsif a ceasefire cannot be secured, though days later Trump said there is a \"very good chance\" a deal will be reached this week. The White House did not respond to Fox News Digital’s questions about what it would mean should the U.S. walk away from one of Trump’s top campaign trail issues: ending the war in Ukraine. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt refuses to say what Trump means when he says he will walk away from peace negotiations, but she told reporters that \"he has grown frustrated with both sides of this war, and he's made that very known.\"(Getty Images) TRUMP HOPEFUL RUSSIA AND UKRAINE CAN MAKE A DEAL AFTER TEMPORARY EASTER CEASEFIRE ENDS The administration also has not clarified if Washington would take retaliatory measures against Putin, asTrump threatenedto do last month. \"Simply because Trump hasn’t announced any consequences yet does not mean that he doesn’t plan on taking some anti-Russia measures,\" former DIA intelligence officer and Russia expert Rebekah Koffler told Fox News Digital. \"Trump almost certainly intends for his economic warfare againstChina to serve as an exampleto Putin how far Trump is willing to go to compel his adversaries to his will.\" \"But unlike the China case, there’s no similar dependence between the U.S. and Russia. Trump’s decision on Russia is much more complicated, more risky and requires more thought,\" she added. \"He may or may not take draconian economic steps against Russia, as Putin may take devastating, non-kinetic actions against the U.S. \"It’s Trump’s risk tolerance vs. Putin’s now,\" Koffler said. \"And both like to win and both have risk tolerance way above average.\" Russian President Vladimir Putin delivers his address to the nation in Moscow on March 23, 2024.(Mikhail Metzel/Pool/AFP via Getty Images)) The White House did not respond to questions by Fox News Digital on whether the U.S. would still aid Ukraine in some capacity, particularly given recent restrictions on military aid Trump has implemented on Kyiv, likerefusing to sell Patriot missilespreviously used to defend civilian populations from Russian strikes and that cost $1.5 billion a piece. \"If we want to be a global superpower, and we want to deter aggression, not with U.S. troops on the ground, but in general, to deter aggression – including potentially with China against Taiwan – because it is good for our national security, then we should think about good options to continue to support Ukraine,\" former CIA Moscow Station Chief Dan Hoffman told Fox News Digital. \"It's a tiny percentage of the Department of Defense budget.\" Women and children view a memorial of flowers and toys at the site of a Russian missile attack in Sumy, Ukraine, on April 14, 2025.(Vlada Liberova/Libkos/Getty Images) TRUMP SAYS US WILL 'TAKE A PASS' ON UKRAINE PEACE EFFORTS IF RUSSIA REFUSES TO PLAY BALL \"The return on investment is pretty high,\" he added, referring to the$66.5 billion in military assistanceWashington has provided Kyiv since Russia’s February 2022 invasion, compared to the $841.4 billion defense budget congressionally approved for 2024 alone, a figure which Trump has pushed to increase. \"Its Ukraine's war of self-defense but its in our interest to deter Putin just as we did with his Soviet predecessors,\" Hoffman said. \"If our goal is to break Putin's alliance with Iran, North Korea and China, then the best way to do it is to prove that Putin's war on Ukraine is a loser for him.\" A Ukrainian delegation was set to meet with Trump administration officials in London on Wednesday alongside other European partners, including representatives from the U.K., France and Germany. Special envoy Steve Witkoff is reportedly set to return to Moscow this week to continue negotiations with Russian officials, though the Kremlin has not indicated they are anywhere near agreeing to ceasefire terms, let alone a peace deal. A spokesperson for Putin, Dmitry Peskov, on Tuesdayreportedly saidthe issue of Russia’s invasion was too \"complex\" to achieve a quick fix and warned against rushing into a deal. \"It is not worth setting any rigid time frames and trying to get a settlement, a viable settlement, in a short time frame,\" he said. The Kremlin’s position has given credence to repeated warnings from security experts thatPutin is notinterestedin securing a peace deal with Ukraine. \"There's no indication that Putin wants to stop the war,\" Hoffman said. \"That isn't surprising. Because for a war to end, somebody has to win or both sides have to be so tired they can't continue to fight. \"Russia is the invader, so you have to stop them in order to have an end of the war,\" he added. \"The one consistent thing here isPutin is continuing to fight.

Areport by the Moscow Timeson Tuesday cited sources close to Putin and said the Kremlin chief is looking to reorder the global \"spheres of influence\" by negotiating leverage points between the U.S. and adversaries like Iran and North Korea. The article claimed that Putin would attempt to get Trump to either force a less-than-desirable deal for Ukraine or potentially stop the U.S. from aiding Kyiv by proposing personally enticing deals, like allowing Trump to build a hotel in Moscow, and geopolitical wins, like securing a nuclear agreement with Iran and a \"peace deal\" in Ukraine.

Cardinal Kevin Farrell, who is running the Vatican administration until Francis' successor is elected, presided over the ceremony in the chapel of the Domus Santa Marta hotel where Francis lived. A choir sang as cardinals wearing their red cassocks and capes stood in prayer. Francis' casket was escorted by a procession of solemn cardinals and Swiss Guards through the same piazza where he greeted the faithful from his popemobile just days before in what would be his final goodbye.

The cardinals and the Swiss Guards processed slowly behind. Ordinary faithful filled St. Peter’s Square to watch the procession enter the basilica. Heads of state are expected for the funeral Saturday in St. Peter’s Square, but the three days of public viewing are largely for ordinary Catholics to pay their respects to the pontiff. The basilica is being kept open until midnight on Wednesday and Thursday. The public mourning period will end on Friday at 7 p.m., when Francis' casket will be closed and sealed. The funeral has been set for Saturday at 10 a.m. in St. Peter’s Square.

Instead, it will just be placed on the main altar of the 16th-century basilica, simply facing the pews. Cardinals continue to meet this week to plan the conclave to elect the next pope and make other decisions about running the Catholic Church. Francis died Monday morning at the age of 88 after suffering a stroke that landed him in a coma and resulted in his heart failure. His death marked the end of his 12-year papacy as the 266th pope and spiritual leader of theRoman Catholic Church.

    "title": "Two federal judges may hold Trump in contempt as he defies courts in immigration crackdown",
    "article_text": "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt details the administration's response to California's decision to grant early prison release to an illegal immigrant convicted in two DUI deaths and President Donald Trump's stance on tariffs with China. A second U.S. judge scolded theTrump administrationon Tuesday night for failing to answer questions in an ongoing deportation case, raising the threat that some Trump officials could be held in contempt of court. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis of Marylandupbraided Trump officialsfor failing to comply with the court’s requests for information in a case involving the deportation of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia — accusing officials in a blistering eight-page order of submitting \"vague, evasive and incomplete\" responses that she said demonstrated \"willful and bad faith refusal to comply with discovery obligations.\" She further described the Justice Department's \"false premise\" objections as \"a willful and bad faith refusal to comply with discovery obligations.\" Xinis is not the first federal judge to raise the possibility of holding the Trump administration in contempt for failing to abide by court orders. Just 15 miles away, at a courthouse in Washington, D.C., another judge had already threatened the same. FEDERAL JUDGE JAMES BOASBERG FINDS PROBABLE CAUSE TO HOLD TRUMP IN CONTEMPT OVER DEPORTATION FLIGHTS Demonstrators gather in a nationwide \"Hands Off!\" protest against President Donald Trump and Elon Musk in Boston on Apr. 5, 2025.(Joseph Prezioso/AFP via Getty) At issue in both cases is PresidentDonald Trump’suse of the Alien Enemies Act, a wartime immigration law the administration invoked last month to immediately deport certain individuals from the U.S. to El Salvador. Hours after Trump’s March 14 proclamation that he would use the law to deport certain migrants — including alleged members of the gangs MS-13 andTren de Aragua, or TdA — the U.S. sent more than 260 migrants to El Salvador to be detained in the country’s maximum-security prison. The weeks since have been characterized by a wave of frantic court proceedings, appeals, and emergency Supreme Court orders, as judges across the country weigh the administration’s use of the wartime law. WHO IS JAMES BOASBERG, THE US JUDGE AT THE CENTER OF TRUMP'S DEPORTATION EFFORTS? U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg  stands for a portrait at E. Barrett Prettyman Federal Courthouse in Washington, D.C.(Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post via Getty Images) But Trump’s lawyers have appeared less than willing to share certain information with the courts. Their behavior has sparked fury from federal judges, who have accused them on more than one occasion of acting in bad faith and willfully defying their orders. Xinis took umbrage Tuesday night at the administration's refusal to respond to at least one interrogatory, saying their refusal is \"based on the false premise that the United States can or has been ordered to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from custody\" in El Salvador. She also rebuked officials for their failure to comply with her earlier order to return Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man and alleged MS-13 member who was wrongfully deported last month to El Salvador. \"For weeks, Defendants have sought refuge behind vague and unsubstantiated assertions of privilege, using them as a shield to obstruct discovery and evade compliance with this Court’s orders,\" she said. Her earlier ruling was upheld by the Supreme Court in an emergency order. The ruling said the government must \"facilitate\" his release — a definition that was subsequently clarified again by Xinis and by judges on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. \"‘Facilitate’ is an active verb,\" U.S. Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, a Reagan appointee, said in authoring the circuit court opinion. \"It requires that steps be taken as the Supreme Court has made perfectly clear,\" he added. TRUMP ADMIN DEFIES COURT OVER MARYLAND DEPORTATION, IGNITES LEGAL SHOWDOWN The Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C.(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File) At a hearing last week, Xinis ordered an \"intense\" and expedited two-week discovery period to determine whether the Trump administration has acted in good faith to comply with her order to return Abrego Garcia. Should they fail to supply the required information, or indicate they acted in bad faith, she could have sufficient information to move to consider possible contempt proceedings. Additionally, in a related case, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg said there was probable cause to find Trump administration officials in criminal contempt for defying his order to return deportation flights to El Salvador on March 15. In a 48-page ruling, Boasberg accused the government of \"willful disregard\" for court directives, citing missed deadlines to submit flight details and identify officials who knew about his emergency order halting removals. Although afederal appeals courtin D.C. has paused the contempt proceedings, Boasberg has requested further declarations and warned that officials may be required to testify under oath. If they fail to comply, the judge couldrefer the caseto the Justice Department for prosecution or appoint outside counsel if DOJ declines.

What happens next remains uncertain. Trump officials have repeatedly railed against so-called \"activist judges,\" accusing courts of obstructing the administration’s immigration agenda. In an earlier emergency appeal, officials claimed Boasberg's actions amounted to a \"massive, unauthorized imposition on the Executive’s authority to remove dangerous aliens,\" arguing those individuals \"pose threats tothe American people.\" Meanwhile, Judge Xinis's order in Maryland comes amid a flurry of immigration-related legal battles nationwide, as Trump pushes forward with his border security priorities. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court ruled 5–4 that the administration can continue using the Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants, provided they receive due process protections, including the right to challenge removals in court. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Separately, federal judges in New York and Texas temporarily blocked use of the Alien Enemies Act in specific cases, siding with plaintiffs who argued certain migrants could be removed without a chance to seek habeas relief. The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment on next steps in the Abrego Garcia case, or on the possibility that Xinis might move on possible contempt proceedings.

    "article_text": "DOGE leader Elon Musk discusses the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, stopping fraud and violent attacks on Tesla on The Five. AMinnesota state employeeavoided criminal charges after vandalizing at least six Tesla vehicles, the local district attorney announced this week, prompting outrage from local leaders who spoke to Fox News Digital. The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office (HCAO) said it would seek \"diversion\" over charges against Minnesota Department of Human Services data analyst Dylan Bryan Adams after causing $20,000 in damages. The diversion approach \"helps to ensure the individual keeps their job and can pay restitution,\" according HCAO. When reached for comment by Fox News Digital, the Minnesota Department of Human Services did not clarify Adams' employment status, but said: \"We are reviewing the matter at this time. State employees are expected to follow our code of conduct and hold themselves to the highest ethical standards through their words and actions.\" Republicans across the North Star State have condemned County Attorney Mary Moriarty's decision, as PresidentDonald Trump'sadministration has identified Tesla vandalism as \"domestic terrorism\" and led a nationwide effort alongside the Justice Department to hold vandals accountable. WALZ STAFFER ACCUSED OF VANDALIZING TESLAS MIGHT NOT FACE CHARGES: REPORT Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., did not respond to Fox News Digital request for clarity on Dylan Bryan Adams' employment status at the Minnesota Department of Human Services.(Getty Images | Hennepin County Sheriff's Office) \"In Tim Walz's Minnesota, there is a two-tiered justice system that does everything possible to protect Democrats. As the victim of a domestic terrorism attack in Minnesota myself, I know first-hand that Minnesota's justice system does not work for me nor Conservatives in our state. If Dylan Adams was a police officer and not part of Walz's Minnesota state government, Mary Moriarty would have tried to charge him with a felony,\" Kendall Qualls, Founder of TakeCharge and former Minnesota gubernatorial candidate, told Fox News Digital in a statement. DEMS WHO RAILED AGAINST DOMESTIC TERRORISM SILENT AS TRUMP FLOATS 20-YEAR JAIL SENTENCE FOR TESLA VANDALS Qualls was targeted in asuspected arson casethat left three conservative group offices heavily damaged in Minnesota in 2024. Quallssaid on Wednesdaythat authorities never found the arsonist. \"Minnesota is again bucking the national trend: While the Justice Department and FBI are investigating the nationwide vandalism and attacks against Tesla as acts of domestic terrorism, Minnesota Progressives are giving them a free pass,\" Matthew RJ Brodsky, President of Red Ax Strategies and Board Chair of the American Center for Counter Extremism, told Fox News Digital. Adam Schwarze, a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in Minnesota, told Fox News Digital that Minnesota vandals \"get a free pass if they have the approved political philosophy.\" \"This would have been an obvious opportunity for the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office to make clear that the right to political protest doesn’t include the right to destroy personal property. We must reaffirm that our commitment to justice means ensuring all individuals, regardless of their political affiliations or employment status, are held to the same legal standards,\" Adam Schwarze said. A Washington Tesla supercharging station was damaged earlier this month, according to authorities. The Trump administration has called Tesla vandalism \"domestic terrorism.\"(Lacey Police Department) Republicans told Fox News Digital that Moriarty refusing to criminally charge a Minnesota state employee, following a string of targeted violence, could invoke domestic terrorism. \"This is a dangerous precedent that tells every Minnesotan that political violence is acceptable here. After Gov. Tim Walz cheered on the loss of Tesla’s stock to the detriment of his own pension. Now we have one of his employees damaging a Tesla and a Democrat country attorney letting him get away with it. It’s a Democrat double-whammy: They insult the professional law enforcement officers of our state by ignoring their work, and then let their political allies and supporters off the hook for breaking the law,\" Minnesota Sen. Mark Koran said. John Nagel, a retired police lieutenant in Minnesota and former candidate for the Minnesota state legislature, said diversion can be a \"great tool for someone who is younger and dumber, but this individual had a responsible job and was old enough to know better.\" WISCONSINITES KICKED OUT AND DENIED ENTRY TO THIS DEMOCRAT'S 'FAKE TOWN HALL'\"This sends a bad message to an already hostile group of politically charged individuals,\" Nagel said. \"As a police officer, I have had several people tell me that if they had spent even a few nights in jail, they wouldn't have committed a crime the second and third time. Brodsky added that Moriarty's latest legal blunder is consistent with her legacy in Walz's home state. Moriarty, who handed Adams a \"pre-charge diversion\" on Monday, has beenbacked by groupstied to money from megadonor George Soros, one of the most prominent backers of progressive issues in the United States. \"It would be an understatement to say that Progressive County Attorney Mary Moriarty has been soft on crime since she took office in 2023. She has consistently shown undue leniency for violent criminal suspects charged with sexual assault and even murder. It is one of the many reasons the Minneapolis Police Department has been at loggerheads with the county attorney’s office, to say nothing of the outrage among the victims’ families,\" Brodsky said. Five Tesla vehicles were set on fire and shot at in what police investigated as a \"targeted attack\" at a local repair center in Las Vegas, Nevada on March 18, 2025. This is one of several Tesla vandalism cases across the United States.(Hal Sparks via Storyful) Nagel questioned how many tax dollars were invested in finding Adams \"only to have their efforts wiped out by a progressive prosecutor\" and leaving Minnesota dealerships on alert \"knowing someone can come into their lot and damage cars.\" As Republicans ripped the state's \"soft on crime\" practices, they tied Walz's own anti-Telsa rhetoric to the string of violence against Elon Musk's multi-billionaire electric vehicle business. Amid the string of attacks on Tesla as its stock was taking a tumble, Walz told a Wisconsin town hall that he checks Tesla's stock when he wants to feel better. \"Gov. Walz’s rhetoric on Tesla stock, Democrats all over the country spewing,'We need to rise up and take it to the streets' is all fueling the fire. Angry elected Democrats are encouraging this kind of behavior. Refusing to hold adults accountable for attacks based on their political hatred is bound to end badly for regular folks,\" Nagel added.

Moreover, these attacks began the same day that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz madecontroversial remarkswhere he cheered the decline of Tesla stocks and disparaged Elon Musk at a Wisconsin event on March 18. The double-standards here speak for themselves. Political violence appears to be acceptable if carried out by progressives. Needless to say, this will undoubtedly embolden pProgressive activists to engage in further attacks,\" Brodsky said. Gov. Walz, Minnesota Department of Public Safety, Minneapolis Police Department and Hennepin County Attorney’s Office did not respond to Fox News Digital's requests for comment.

    "article_text": "Fox News' Danamarie McNicholl reports on the Florida attorney general launching a lawsuit against Snapchat on ‘America Reports.’ Florida's Attorney General James Uthmeier filed a lawsuit Monday against Snap Inc., the parent company of Snapchat, alleging the popular platform has been \"openly defying\" state law aimed at protecting young minors from addictive social media features and obscene and dangerous content. Attorney General Uthmeier, who was recently appointed by Florida GOPGov. Ron DeSantis, alleged in a circuit court complaint filed Monday that Snapchat utilizes addictive features to attract minors under the age of 13, who companies like Snapchat aren't even allowed to provide accounts to under state law H.B. 3 in Florida. The suit also alleges Snapchat does not adequately verify its users' ages, notingparental consentis required in Florida for Snapchat users who are under 16, and has been deceptive about its identification of content that is not supposed to be accessible to minors. \"Snap's conduct is particularly egregious because it continues to market Snapchat in Florida as safe for users as young as 13 even though it knows that Snapchat can be easily used to access pornography andbuy drugs, among many other dangers,\" Uthmeier's complaint states. \"Rather than obeying Florida law by removing 13-year-old users from the platform and seeking parental consent for 14- and 15-year-old users, Snap is actively deceivingFlorida parentsabout the risks of allowing their teens to access this platform.\" META'S ANTITRUST TRIAL KICKS OFF CHALLENGING THE COMPANY'S SOCIAL MEDIA DOMINANCE Florida officials filed suit Monday against Snap Inc., the owner and operator of Snapchat, alleging it has been \"openly defying\" state law aimed at protecting young minors.(GETTY IMAGES/FOX NEWS) Uthmeierargued in his suitthat Snapchat's current age ratings for content are \"highly deceptive and unfair,\" pointing to a Washington Post columnist who tested Snapchat's AI chatbot feature and was able to get it to provide instructions to a 13-year-old on how to mask the smell of pot and alcohol. He pointed to Snapchat's \"Find Friends\" feature as well, among others, which Uthmeier alleged has \"connected minors with adult strangers seeking to groom, harass, exploit, and even assault them, or to sell them illegal drugs.\" According to Uthmeier, Snapchat has recognized in other litigation that it is subject to the provisions under Florida's H.B. 3, leading him to assert in the Monday complaint that the platform is \"openly defying this important public health measure.\" However, Snap Inc. argues that the underlying premise of Uthmeier's complaint, that Snapchat is violating H.B. 3, is flawed because the law infringes on theFirst Amendment rightsof adults and young people. Simultaneously, Snap Inc. said, H.B. 3 fails to adequately address age verification and opens up Floridians to data protection and privacy issues. TEENS ARE TURNING TO SNAPCHAT'S ‘MY AI’ FOR MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT – WHICH DOCTORS WARN AGAINST \"We believe there are more privacy-conscious solutions to online safety and managing age verification, including at the operating system, app store, or device level,\" a Snap Inc. spokesperson said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"In addition, there is a current challenge to the constitutionality of this law pending in Florida federal court, and we hoped that the state would allow this challenge to proceed through the proper legal process. Unfortunately, they’ve decided to file a complaint in state court in an attempt to bypass the issues that are already being heard in federal court.\" Attorney General James Uthmeier, who was recently appointed by Florida GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis, alleged in a circuit court complaint filed Monday that Snapchat utilizes addictive features to attract minor users under the age of 13, which state law H.B. 3 prohibits companies like Snapchat from doing.(GETTY IMAGES/FOX NEWS) H.B. 3 has been challenged by industry groups in a lawsuit last year arguing the state law violated First Amendment rights. The plaintiff's in that suit, the Computer & Communications Industry Association and NetChoice, which collectively represent numerous majorsocial media platformsincluding Snapchat, have also challenged other state laws aimed at protecting minors from harmful social media features and content on the grounds they violate the First Amendment. The law prohibits social media apps that utilize certain addictive features, such as push notifications, autoplay features, infinity scrolling, and more, from allowing users under the age of 13 to open an account. For users under 16, parental notification must be obtained. The bill also requires companies like Snapchat that knowingly publish adult content on their platforms to take steps to prohibit access to such material by any users under 18. SNAPCHAT AI CHATBOT ALLEGEDLY GAVE ADVICE TO 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL ON RELATIONSHIP WITH 31-YEAR-OLD MAN, HAVING SEX According to the law, any platforms that knowingly or recklessly violate H.B. 3's requirements can be subject to enforcement under the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act, which can result in fines of up to $50,000 per incident. Meanwhile, account holders who are minors may also pursue up to $10,000 in damages. \"We’re actively challenging Florida’s law because it violates the First Amendment,\" Paul Taske, NetChoice Associate Director of Litigation, told Fox News Digital. \"We’re confident we will be successful.\" With Snapchat’s release of its new generative A.I. feature, Dreams, director of the Center for Technology & Innovation at the Competitive Enterprise Institute Jessica Melugin told Fox News Digital the platform is \"at the frontier\" of bringing A.I. capabilities to the social media public.(Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Nonprofits that promote parental rights, including the American Parents Coalition and the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children, expressed support for Uthmeier's suit, pointing out that social media use among minors can have detrimental impacts to their mental fitness and overall well-being later in life. \"It is indisputable that social media is hurtingour kids' mental and physical health,\"Alleigh Marré, Executive Director of American Parents Coalition, told Fox News Digital. \"Beyond the broad challenges young people face with the intentionally addictive nature of the platforms, Snapchat has allowed poor safety measures and inadequate parental controls to put our kids at risk. From sexual predators to drug dealers, to pornography, Snapchat’s leadership is aware of the risks associated with the platform, especially for young people, but they’ve put profit ahead of protection.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Attorney General Uthmeier recognizes that Florida's children are the future of our community and our most precious asset. General Uthmeier’s focus on protecting children from inappropriate content and the threats posed by child predators demonstrates a profound understanding of their vulnerability and the imperative need to keep them safe online,\" added Bob Cunningham, Director of Policy Engagement for the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children. \"By prioritizing their protection, he is not only enhancing our current legislative landscape but also setting a vital example for others to follow.\"",

ICE NON-DETAINED DOCKET EXPLODES TO 7.4M CASES Border Patrol may have new tools to deport sexually violent illegal immigrants if a new bill passes.(Getty) The BE GONE Act formally expands the definition of \"aggravated felonies\" under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, also known as Title 8–which consolidated several immigration provisions prior to the Eisenhower administration into one comprehensive U.S. code, set visa quotas, and exempted certain family members of Americans from some immigration restrictions. \"President Trump and his team have hit the ground running, reversing the damage from the last four years, but we must ensure that every last sexual predator let in by Joe Biden is deported,\" Ernst told Fox News Digital on Wednesday. \"The health and safety of our citizens must always come first, and I am proud to continue working with President Trump to protect the American people,\" she added. \"These violent, criminal illegal aliens need to BE GONE!\" Gonzales, who represents the largest Mexican-border district in the House, said the illegal immigration epicenters of Eagle Pass and Del Rio are both in his jurisdiction.

The bill also received support from \"sensible immigration\" group NumbersUSA. \"This is common sense legislation, following up on the Laken Riley Act, that Congress passed this year to protect Americans from criminal illegal aliens,\" Michael Hough, its director of federal affairs, said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Joe Chatham, an official at the Federation for American Immigration Reform, added that Congress should pass the change to Title 8 swiftly. \"FAIR is proud to support the BE GONE Act and protecting American communities from illegal alien crime,\" said Chatham. \"Under the Biden administration’s policies, tens of thousands of criminal aliens were apprehended attempting to enter illegally, with shocking data last year showing that there were at least 16,320 aliens in the U.S. convicted of sexual assault.\" Co-sponsor Ernst also notably spearheaded Sarah’s Law — signed by Trump earlier this year. That bill was named for Sarah Root, who was killed by anillegal immigrantin 2016, and for whose family Ernst fought for nearly a decade to get justice.

A Democrat in the House of Representatives' progressive \"Squad\" is arguing that the Trump administration could soon jail people in the U.S. for a variety of non-criminal reasons, seemingly regardless of their legal status. Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., made the comments after visiting college studentsRumeysa Ozturkand Mahmoud Khalil. Both are being held at an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility after being accused of espousing pro-Hamas beliefs. Neither are U.S. citizens, though both are in the country legally; Khalil is a legal permanent resident, and Ozturk is on a student visa. \"If people are tempted to marginalize and ‘other’ who this could happen to, again, inDonald Trump'sAmerica, this could be you. This could be you, for some, for a miscarriage. This could be you for practicing diversity, equity and inclusion. This could be you for reading a banned book,\" Pressley said in a press conference after the event. \"It is acutely about Mahmood and Rumeysa, because those are some of the most high-profile cases, but it has implications for every single person who calls this country home.\" Pressley traveled to a Louisiana ICE facility alongside fellow Massachusetts Democrats, Sen.

And yet, even in the face, in the midst of all of that, she is still doing her research. She is still advocating for the women alongside her,\" Pressley said. Meanwhile, like Pressley, McGovern told reporters, \"If the government can imprison people, like them, who dissent, without due process — in this instance, there is nothing to stop the government from going after you, too.\" A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) called the allegations about Ozturk's detention \"unequivocally false.\" Rep.

    "title": "Supreme Court likely to side with parents in letting them opt out of LGBTQ storybooks, expert says",
    "article_text": "Fox News host Laura Ingraham breaks down the Supreme Court case on a woke curriculum opt-out plan and religious liberty in the classroom on ‘The Ingraham Angle.’ Several Supreme Court justices signaledsympathy Tuesdaytoward Maryland parents who are seeking to opt their children out of LGBTQ-themed classroom materials. One education expert said the case could lead to a ruling that expands parental rights in public schools nationwide. \"This looks pretty promising for the parent petitioners in this case,\" said Sarah Parshall Perry, vice president and legal fellow of the grassroots organization Defending Education. \"I heard a lot of very aggressive questioning from the three liberal justices, but no matter how you slice this apple, it looks to be a very clear violation of the First Amendment, as exercised through the 14th Amendment's right to direct a child's religious upbringing.\" Perry previously served as the lead lawyer to the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Education from 2020 to 2021, where she drafted the Office for Civil Rights’ (OCR) annual report to Congress. THE SUPREME COURT APPEARS TO SIDE WITH PARENTS IN RELIGIOUS LIBERTY DISPUTE OVER STORYBOOKS Justices Gorsuch, left, and Roberts(AP/SCOTUS) \"They're very malleable,\" Perry said of the 4-and 5-year-olds in the case. \"They're very much shaped by their environment, by what they're exposed to, and they don't have the meaningful agency to be able to opt out or object or push back. And so these individuals are learning their own familial values while being exposed to material that is, as Justice [Amy Coney] Barrett and Justice [Neil] Gorsuch pointed out, designed to influence their thinking.\" At the heart of Mahmoud v. Tayloris a lawsuit brought byreligious parents—Muslim, Roman Catholic, and Ukrainian Orthodox—who argue that the school district’s policy violates their First Amendment rights by forcing their children to engage with instruction that contradicts their faith. The Fourth Circuit Court, a federal appeals court, ruled last year that there was no violation of religious exercise rights, stating that the policy did not force parents to change their religious beliefs or conduct and that parents could still teach their children outsideof school. Several conservative justices, including Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, appeared sympathetic to the parents' concerns during the two-and-a-half-hour oral debate. Alito questioned the moral messages conveyed by books like \"Uncle Bobby's Wedding,\" suggesting that such content might conflict with deeply held religious beliefs. Justice Brett Kavanaugh also pressed the school district's attorneys on why opt-out provisions, similar to those in sex education, could not be extended to these storybooks. PARENTS TELL SCOTUS: LGBTQ STORYBOOKS IN CLASSROOMS CLASH WITH OUR FAITH SCOTUS justices appear to favor straight woman in discrimination case.(iStock) Meanwhile, the liberal justices argued that mere exposure to these books may not constitute coercion or a violation of religious freedoms. The school district contended that the policy promotes inclusivity and exposure to LGBTQ viewpoints does not equate to forced belief changes. \"I think it was highly sort of predictable,\" Perry said of theliberal justices'arguments. \"They are trying to prove that there is going to be too much of a burden on the school district to allow these children to opt out because the consequences could, for example, be catastrophic for the ability of a public school to manage its own affairs.\" \"The reason we see an issue like this atthe Supreme Courtis because these are issues directly related to religious liberty and directly related to the very early cognitive stages of development for minor children,\" Perry said. \"And it's very clear … that a burden of religious liberty within public education has to be treated quite seriously by the court and deference must be given to religious parents if the burden is very clear.\" \"I think in this instance, it is indeed crystal clear,\" she added. LAWSUIT TRACKER: NEW RESISTANCE BATTLING TRUMP'S SECOND TERM THROUGH ONSLAUGHT OF LAWSUITS TAKING AIM AT EOS (Fox News Digital) Among the storybooks at the center of the case is \"Prince & Knight,\" a modern fairy tale aimed at children ages 4 to 8, which tells the story of two men who fall in love after joining forces to defeat a dragon and later marry. Another book frequently referenced during oral arguments was \"Uncle Bobby's Wedding,\" which follows a young girl processing her favorite uncle’s decision to marry another man. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Because parental rights have become sort of the cultural zeitgeist for where we are in this political day and age, I think we are certain to see more litigation, not less, and more pushback,\" Perry said. The Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling in the case by late June.

    "title": "Venezuelan government uses Tren de Aragua as proxies to undermine US public safety, FBI assessment finds",
    "article_text": "Fox News correspondent Christina Coleman has the latest on President Donald Trump’s immigration policies aiming to take violent criminals off the streets on ‘Fox Report.’ EXCLUSIVE:The FBI assesses that some Venezuelan government officials \"likely facilitate\" the migration of members of the violent gangTren de Araguafrom Venezuela to the United States to advance the Maduro regime’s objective of undermining public safety in the U.S., Fox News Digital has learned. A senior administration official exclusively shared with Fox News Digital Wednesday unclassified portions of the FBI’s classified intelligence assessment of the Venezuelan government’s relationship withTren de Aragua. TRUMP ISSUES WARNING TO MADURO AS VENEZUELAN LEADER ENTERS THIRD TERM, US EXPANDS SANCTIONS PresidentDonald Trump, upon taking office, designated Tren de Aragua, as well as several other migrant gangs present throughout the U.S., as a foreign terrorist organization. Fox News Digital has learned that the FBI assesses that some Venezuelan government officials are likely using Tren de Aragua members as proxies for the Maduro regime in an effort to destabilize Chile, Ecuador, Peru, Colombia and the United States. The official said the FBI assesses that this demonstrates Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro’s willingness to violate the territorial sovereignty of Venezuela’s neighbors to advance his regime’s policies. The FBI assesses that in the next six to 18 months, Venezuelan government officials likely will attempt to leverage Tren de Aragua members in the United States as proxy actors to threaten, abduct and kill members of the Venezuelan diaspora in the United States who are vocal critics of Maduro and his regime. The FBI expects an expansion of similar activities throughout South America. TRUMP ADMIN FILES FIRST RACKETEERING CHARGES AGAINST MASSIVE MIGRANT TERRORIST GROUP PRESENT IN US \"These findings should shock Americans but not the law enforcement community,\" a senior administration official told Fox News Digital. \"They reflect the sentiments of numerous other intelligence assessments across multiple agencies.\" Any further details or specific examples remain classified. \"Nicholas Maduro is a Marxist dictator who hijacked a once-prosperous Venezuela and brought in nothing but total economic collapse and gang takeover,\" the official said. \"He crumbled Caracas, now overrun with drugs and violence, and wants to do the same across the United States by sending his most violent and dangerous criminals into our communities.\" The Venezuelan leader, deemed a \"dictator\" by American lawmakers, is set to hold office until 2031. \"The Trump administration will continue to use every authority in our power to make sure these TdA terrorists, who are some of the worst in the world, are kept out of our country,\" the U.S. official said. \"The American people voted overwhelmingly to make America safe again, and that is exactly what we will do.\" Fox News Digital also spoke to an official from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence Wednesday, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The ODNI official told Fox News Digital that the FBI’s assessment is based on its domestic law enforcement operations against Tren de Aragua in America. \"This information and intelligence are the most robust and accurate given their focus on domestic security and crimes, versus limited intelligence assessments from other intelligence elements who by law focus solely on foreign intelligence collection and who, until President Trump took office, had very limited resources focused on TdA,\" the official said. Meanwhile, the ODNI official briefed Fox News Digital on unclassified information from its assessment on Tren de Aragua’s relationship with the Venezuelan government. The official said ODNI assesses that Tren de Aragua leaders historically have been \"located and broadly benefited from conditions in Venezuela created by the Venezuelan government.\" \"The Venezuelan government gives sanctuary to TdA, aiding and abetting their crimes and terrorist activities against the United States by enabling them to thrive,\" the ODNI told Fox News Digital. The official said that unlike most countries, the Maduro regime has \"been eager to welcome violent TdA criminals back to Venezuela, providing further proof they see them as allies. Again, this mirrors the behavior of the Taliban in Afghanistan and other Middle Eastern failed states like Syria and Libya that have welcomed terrorists with open arms.\" The Associated Press recently reported on a classified assessment from the National Intelligence Council, citing anonymous sources, that its assessment found no coordination between Tren de Aragua and the Venezuelan government. But Director of National IntelligenceTulsi Gabbardblasted the report, saying the officials who illegally shared the classified information weaponized the intelligence to undermine Trump. \"The weaponization of intelligence to undermine the President's agenda is an assault on democracy,\" Gabbard said. \"Those behind this illegal leak of classified intelligence, twisted and manipulated to convey the exact opposite finding, will be accountable under the full force of the law.\" The ODNI official said the unclassified assessment information shared with Fox News Digital Wednesday \"are facts based on intelligence that the illegal leakers and propaganda media conveniently did not include because it gets in the way of their biased narrative and attempt to deceive the American people.\" Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem toured the El Salvador prison holding hundreds of alleged members of Tren de Aragua who were deported from the U.S.(Credit: Pool) The release of the unclassified information to Fox News Digital comes after the Trump administration filed its first racketeering charges — also known as RICO charges, which include conspiring to commit murder, sex-trafficking, assault, dealing drugs and more — against Tren de Aragua members and its associates in New York Tuesday. CLICK HERE FOR MORE IMMIGRATION COVERAGE That case was part of \"Operation Take Back America,\" which it said is a \"nationwide initiative that marshals the full resources of theJustice Departmentto repel the invasion of illegal immigration, achieve the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations (TCOs), and protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime.\" The charges filed against 27 alleged current and former Tren de Aragua members include human smuggling, sex trafficking and murder.

The statement said that 16 were already in federal criminal, immigration or state custody, and five were arrested in the past couple of days. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP U.S. Attorney GeneralPam Bondicommented on the RICO charges, saying: \"Today’s indictments and arrests span three states and will devastate TdA’s infrastructure as we work to completely dismantle and purge this organization from our country.\" \"Tren de Aragua is not just a street gang,\" said Bondi. \"It is a highly structured terrorist organization that has destroyed American families with brutal violence, engaged in human trafficking, and spread deadly drugs through our communities.\" Brooke Singman is a political correspondent and reporter for Fox News Digital, Fox News Channel and FOX Business.",

PresidentDonald Trumpslammed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s statement on Crimea, saying it was \"very harmful\" to peacemaking efforts. \"It’s inflammatory statements like Zelenskyy’s that make it so difficult to settle this war,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. \"He has nothing to boast about! The situation for Ukraine is dire — He can have peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole country.\" Trump also rejectedZelenskyy’s red linein the Truth Social post, saying it was \"not even a point of discussion,\" as the territory was \"lost years ago\" under then-President Barack Obama.

This would also involve the freezing of current frontlines. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.(Getty Images) In 2022, Zelenskyy said that the \"Russian war against Ukraine and against the entire free Europe began with Crimea and must end with Crimea — and its liberation,\"Axios reported. He reiterated this stance on Tuesday, shutting down the idea that Ukraine would recognize Russian control of Crimea. \"Ukraine will not legally recognize the occupation of Crimea,\" Zelenskyy said at a press conference on Tuesday, according toThe Wall Street Journal. \"There’s nothing to talk about here.

During their infamous meeting in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, Trump said that Zelenskyy’s \"hatred\" of Russian PresidentVladimir Putinwas making it \"very tough\" to make a deal. \"You see the hatred he's got for Putin, it's very tough for me to make a deal with that kind of hate, he's got tremendous hatred,\" Trump told reporters. \"And I understand that, but I can tell you the other side isn't exactly in love with, you know, him, either.\" From left: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy depicted with President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.(Fox News Digital image) TRUMP INSISTS UKRAINE-RUSSIA PEACE DEAL IS CLOSE, BUT MISTRUST IN PUTIN LEAVES EXPERTS SKEPTICAL Trump appeared to allude to the Oval Office meeting in his Truth Social post, calling Zelenskyy \"the man with no cards to play.\" This echoed Trump’s remark during the tense February meeting in which he said that Zelenskyy didn’t \"have the cards\" to make major demands in peace talks. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP While Zelenskyy has made his demands clear, it remains uncertain what might persuade Putin to agree to a ceasefire. Although Trump administration officials have stated that they have had productive conversations with Putin, they have yet to get Russia to agree to a ceasefire proposal.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) charged an illegal immigrant with the murder of a mother in Maryland on Wednesday, just five days after Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., returned to the state from his high-profile El Salvador visit to try to retrieve a deported alleged MS-13 member. ICE arrested Keycy Robinson Alexis Barrera-Rosa, a 23-year-old Guatemalan national on April 5 in Charles County. He was later charged on April 23 after the body of Lesbia Mileth Ramirez Guerra from LaPlata was discovered buried near a state forest. ICE said Barrera-Rosa would be \"fully prosecuted\" for the alleged murder, according to ICE. NOT A MARYLAND MAN: GOP BLASTS DEMOCRAT SENATOR FIGHTING TO RETURN SALVADORAN NATIONAL Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., is welcomed by supporters upon his arrival from meeting with Kilmar Abrego Garcia in El Salvador, at Washington Dulles International Airport, in Chantilly, Va., on April 18, 2025.(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) When asked by Fox News Digital about prominent Maryland illegal immigrant violent crimes as of late, Van Hollen responded after press time Wednesday, saying that \"with federal and state leaders working together, we’ve made strategic investments in public safety that have helped reduce violent crime across Maryland for three years in a row.\" \"But more needs to be done – because no family should have to endure the pain of being ripped apart by violence. We will continue working to fight crime in all its forms and build a stronger, safer Maryland,\" he said. Regarding Guerra's murder, he said he \"cannot imagine the grief and pain that the family of Ms. Guerra is feeling right now.\" \"I thank all of those in law enforcement who have been part of the extensive search effort and investigation,\" he added. He added that it is important to respect the rule of law and that courts are meant to provide due process rights for all. \"Now, Ms. Guerra’s family and friends, and our community, will see her suspected killer and anyone involved in this crime face justice in a court of law.\" DEMOCRAT'S EL SALVADOR TRIP LAMPOONED IN SENATE GOP FAUX TOURISM AD: 'BIENVENIDOS' Meanwhile, Van Hollen and the several House Democrats who followed his lead in traveling to Central America to aid Garcia have become the focal point of the GOP's derision in recent days. For instance, the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) launched a fake tourism ad saying Democrats \"should feel free to make their trip to hang out with MS-13 gangbangers one-way.\" The ad came after serious crimes at the hands of illegal immigrants cropped up around the Old Line State. Most recently, Victor Martinez-Hernandez was found guilty of killingRachel Morinon the Ma & Pa Trail in Bel Air. Morin’s mother, Patty, was later invited to speak from the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House, where she lambasted Van Hollen for traveling to El Salvador to help Garcia. On Sunday, Van Hollen told \"Fox News Sunday\" that what happened to the Morin family \"was awful and unacceptable.\" Last week, a jury took less than an hour to convict another Maryland illegal immigrant murder suspect – Victor Martinez-Hernandez – on first-degree premeditated murder charges in Harford County. Also last week, ICE arrested Guatemalan national Rene Pop-Chub in Hyattsville, Maryland, outside Washington. Pop-Chub had pending murder, assault and reckless endangerment charges, and was the subject of an ignored detainer by a county corrections office, according to anICE statement. \"The arrest of Rene Pop-Chub underscores the critical importance of cooperation between federal and local counterparts,\" ICE Baltimore Acting Field Office Director Nikita Baker said in a statement.

Amaya's arrest markedwhat ICE saidwas a record of 153 arrests of noncitizen sex offenders in Maryland in FY-2024. An ICE official called the case a \"landmark arrest\" for the Baltimore field office, and said in a statement that Amaya was previously arrested in the same county in 2009 and charged with second-degree rape. He was deported in 2013 and 2018, albeit from other states. Despite the high-profile cases in Maryland, Gov. Wes Moore told Fox News Digital the state has seen \"significant drops\" in violent crimes. \"Our law enforcement officials work hard every day, in coordination with federal partners, to root out violent crime in our state. This is exactly what happened in this case, and what we do every day to keep Marylanders safe – hold perpetrators accountable for their crimes, regardless of immigration status,\" Moore added, referring to the Guerra case.

    "article_text": "Michelle Patidar, a Chicago-based health nutrition coach, reveals the health benefits of matcha and how it can help to lower the risk for cancer development. Dancing it out can be a great way torecover from chemo. That's according to new research from The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, which found thatdancing the tangocan boost neurological recovery in cancer patients by reducing lingering symptoms of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy-induced neuropathy (CIN) is a condition that can occur anywhere throughout the body, but mostly impacts the hands, feet and limbs, according to an OSU press release. EXPERIMENTAL WOMEN'S CANCER DRUG BOOSTS SURVIVAL RATES IN NOTABLE STUDY Eighty percent ofbreast cancer survivorsexperience CIN, which can cause pain, falls, difficulty walking and diminished quality of life, experts say. Previous data showed that music and exercise can \"help prevent neurologic degeneration,\" the researchers said.(iStock) The DAANCE study assessed how the adapted Argentine tango can help restore mobility and alleviate symptoms like numbness, burning, tingling and loss of feeling in these problem areas. The study, led by Lise Worthen-Chaudhari, PhD, a scientist in the OSU Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, was funded by the National Institute on Aging. POPULAR COFFEE ALTERNATIVE MAY HELP PREVENT CANCER, SAY EXPERTS Worthen-Chaudhari, a former dancer herself, expressed the need foralternative treatment optionsfor CIN. The researcherand her team designed the study for breast cancer survivors experiencing CIN who had received their last chemotherapy treatment at least three months prior. \"There is hope for recovery from the beating that cancer gives your body, brain and nerves.\" In the early stages of the study, the researchers found that small doses of social dance improved dual-task function compared to larger doses ofat-home exercise. This could be due to the cognitive engagement of dual-task functioning, the researchers concluded. The Argentine tango, a social dance that originated in Argentina, requires cognitive engagement.(iStock) Just 20 minutes of social dance a few times a week could begin to \"rewire the neuropathways that have been impacted by cancer treatment,\" according to Worthen-Chaudhari. Preliminary data also shows that dancing the tango can lead to improvements in balance,cognitive function, motor function and neuropathy symptoms. ‘I’M A CANCER SURVIVOR – HERE'S WHAT I'VE CUT FROM MY KITCHEN' The rhythm of the Argentine tango, at 120 beats per minute, helps activate a \"neural phenomenon\" called \"entrainment,\" where \"two or more oscillating systems (like brainwaves or behaviors) align,\" the researchers noted. Given tango's ideal cadence, Worthen-Chaudhari told Fox News Digital that it \"made sense\" that doing the dance a couple of times per week would deliver positive effects of \"movement, rhythmic entrainment and social connection, all at once, in a way that promoted recovery more than any of those elements in isolation.\" Pilot data shows that this repetitive, slow music and walking dance help re-map nervesdamaged by chemotherapy, she added. \"This work is about helping survivors reclaim their lives and thrive, rather than just survive.\" Other institutions have also reported success in balance and cognition after using adapted tango withParkinson’s diseasepatients. This therapy could help individuals with other conditions, such as diabetes, dementia, neurodegenerative diseases and general aging, Worthen-Chaudhari noted. In addition to cancer patients, dancing the tango could also help individuals with other conditions and could relieve general aging effects, the researchers stated.(iStock) An expanded five-year study will continue to look into dual-task performance, with plans to recruit 140breast cancer survivorsat the OSU Cancer Center. The researchers will explore whether the effects of tango therapy can be sustained over time to improve movement and cognitive functions.

    "title": "Blood test could predict skin cancer recurrence, study shows",
    "article_text": "A Chicago woman was just weeks away from giving birth when a nagging cough led to a shocking medical discovery. MaKenna Lauterbach, then 26 years old, shares the story of how doctors at Northwestern Medicine saved her life. Researchers at NYU Langone Health and its Perlmutter Cancer Center have revealed that blood tests could predict the return ofskin cancer. Melanoma is a less common form of skin cancer that is more dangerous than other varieties, according to the American Cancer Society. This is because it’s much more likely to spread to other parts of the body if not found and treated early. CANCER REPORT REVEALS SURPRISING NEW DATA ON DEATHS, DIAGNOSES The newcancer research, published in The Lancet Oncology journal, examined the levels of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) found in cancer patients' blood. Approximately 80% of stage 3 melanoma patients who had detectable levels of ctDNA went on to experience a return of the cancer later.(iStock) Approximately 80% of stage 3 melanoma patients who had detectable levels of ctDNA (before they started treatment) went on to experience a return of the cancer later, according to a press release from NYU Langone. Stage 3 melanoma – one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer – occurs when thecancer has spreadto the lymph nodes. POPULAR COFFEE ALTERNATIVE MAY HELP PREVENT CANCER, SAY EXPERTS The lymph nodes can be surgically removed, but once they’re gone, that makes it harder to monitor for cancer using traditional methods such as X-rays and CT scans, researchers noted. That challenge has sparked interest in finding new ways to detect cancer activity sooner. Melanoma is a less common form of skin cancer that's more dangerous than other varieties due to how quickly it spreads.(iStock) \"Our findings suggest that circulating tumor DNA tests could help oncologists identify whichmelanoma patientsare most likely to respond well to therapy,\" said lead author Mahrukh Syeda in the release. Early detection of the disease’s return through ctDNA analysis could save lives, according to Syeda, as this type of cancer is notoriously difficult to treat once it has spread. \"Circulating tumor DNA tests provide a clear, direct measure of the disease itself.\" The study analyzed results from nearly 600 men and women who participated in an earlier clinical trial. Researchers used blood samples to compare ctDNA presence and evidence of cancer returning. The team accounted for other factors like sex, age, and type of therapy used to combat the cancer. COMMON MEDICAL TEST LINKED TO 5% OF CANCERS, STUDY SUGGESTS: ‘USE THEM WISELY’ Almost all patients who had detectable levels of ctDNA within one year of treatment experienced a return of melanoma. \"The ctDNA method works by focusing on the most common mutations in thegenetic codein melanoma cells,\" according to the release. Almost all patients who had detectable levels of ctDNA within a year of treatment experienced a return of the melanoma, the researchers found.(iStock) Assessing ctDNA levels was as good or better at predicting recurrence than other tests that involve examining the tumor itself, the researchers found. \"Unlike standard, tissue-based analyses oftumor cells, which can only suggest the likelihood of recurrence, circulating tumor DNA tests provide a clear, direct measure of the disease itself and can tell us outright that melanoma has returned,\" said senior author and dermatologist David Polsky in the press release. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER In some cases, however, the cancer still returned even though patients had negative ctDNA tests before starting therapy. Researchers plan to improve the sensitivity of the tests in the next study in hopes of reducing cases like these. \"It is clear from this paper and others that persistent circulating tumor DNA after a curative surgery is a poor prognostic sign, suggesting a high risk for early recurrence.\"(iStock) Dr. Joshua Strauss, an attending hematologist and medical oncologist at Advanced Care Oncology and Hematology Associates of the Atlantic Medical Group in Morristown, New Jersey, applauded the research.

    "title": "'I'm a neurologist — here's why dementia is rising and how to reduce your risk’",
    "article_text": "Dr. Joel Salinas, a behavioral neurologist and associate professor at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, speaks with Fox News Digital about why dementia cases are increasing and how people can reduce their risk. Dementia cases continue to rise in the U.S., with people over age 55 facing a 42% risk of developing the condition in their lifetime. A recent study led by Johns Hopkins predicted half a milliondementia casesin 2025 and one million per year by 2060. That doesn’t mean people are powerless in reducing their risk, however, according to Dr. Joel Salinas, a behavioral neurologist and associate professor at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. BLOOD PRESSURE AND DEMENTIA RISK SHARE SURPRISING LINK, STUDY SUGGESTS Salinas joined Fox News Digital in an on-camera interview to discuss what’s driving the spike in dementia cases and what behavioral changes could provide some degree of cognitive protection.(See the video at the top of the article.) One of the biggest factors in the increase is demographics, noted Salinas, who is also the co-founder and chief medical officer of Isaac Health, a virtual memory clinic for brain health and memory issues. Dementia cases continue to rise in the U.S., with people over age 55 facing a 42% risk of developing the condition in their lifetime.(iStock) \"The baby boomer population, being one of the largest groups, is also thefastest-aging group,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"As we get more and more baby boomers — not just over 65, but into their 70s and 80s — we're going to see more and more of them developing some degree of cognitive impairment due to a plethora of reasons.\" Age is indeed the biggest risk factor, he noted. \"After age 65, our risk starts to increase. By the time we get to our 80s, that risk is about one in three,\" he said. \"And then after 85, it starts to go up even higher, to almost one in two.\" \"We know that individuals who don't have a lot of social engagement are at a higher risk.\" The pandemic could have played a role as well, the neurologist said. \"This is still being understood, but it seems likeCOVID-19also affected blood vessels in the body and the brain,\" he said. \"So people who already had a vulnerability for developing dementia could have had an acceleration or an earlier presentation.\" STROKE, DEMENTIA AND DEPRESSION SHARE THESE 17 PREVENTABLE RISK FACTORS Research has also shown that loneliness and social isolation can increase one’s risk ofcognitive decline. \"We know that individuals who don't have a lot of social engagement are at a higher risk,\" Salinas said. A recent study led by Johns Hopkins predicted half a million dementia cases in 2025 and one million per year by 2060.(iStock) \"There's still a lot being done to figure out, you know, the chicken or the egg — is it that you're developing the disease and you're presenting with symptoms of loneliness earlier than others, or is it the loneliness and social isolation that increases your risk? I think it's probably both.\" There is a genetic component of dementia, the neurologist said, but the good news is that it’s rare. SMARTPHONE USE COULD REDUCE DEMENTIA RISK IN OLDER ADULTS, STUDY FINDS \"If you think about risks and protective factors like a seesaw, these raregenetic mutationsmay outweigh anything protective you do, but the nice thing is that because they're rare, the chances are you don't have those risks,\" he said. \"So you probably have genetic risk that can be outweighed to some degree by protective factors.\" A major study published last year in The Lancet found that almost half of dementia cases are potentially preventable withlifestyle modifications. There are many different factors to address, Salinas said, with proper nutrition and exercise topping the list. \"Obstructive sleep apnea, which is a common sleep disorder, affects blood pressure, heart disease and brain health,\" the neurologist said.(iStock) Addressing hearing loss by using a hearing aid can also help keep dementia at bay, according to the neurologist, as can staying socially engaged. Quitting smokingand limiting alcohol consumption can also boost prevention, as does getting enough quality sleep. HEALTH BOOST AND DEMENTIA PREVENTION IN JUST 5 MINUTES A DAY Entering a specific stage of sleep called \"slow wave\" or \"stage three\" helps to clear out the buildup of toxic proteins in the brain, Salinas said. \"If someone is havingissues with sleep, we send them to see a sleep specialist to do the proper testing,\" he said. \"Obstructive sleep apnea, which is a common sleep disorder, affects blood pressure, heart disease and brain health. And it's something that's treatable.\" The female gynecologist smiles while explaining the test results to her patient.(iStock) With anyhealthy behavior, consistency is key. \"It’s about putting the odds in your favor that you'll be less likely to develop one of these conditions, or at least delay the onset of symptoms,\" Salinas said. \"It's never too late to take them on, but whenever you start them, the more consistent you are with them, the bigger return you'll have.\" Salinas cited studies showing that 92% of people with mild cognitive impairment go undiagnosed. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"That's when we really want to intervene — but most of the time, people are being diagnosed when the condition is moderate to severe.\" While it can be tricky to distinguish between the regular effects of aging and early signs of dementia, Salinas called out some key differentiators. \"It’s about putting the odds in your favor that you'll be less likely to develop one of these conditions, or at least delay the onset of symptoms.\" \"We have more difficulty withmemory and thinkingas we get older, but it should never be to the point where it interferes with our day-to-day functioning,\" he said. It’s normal to experience \"blips\" once in a while, he said, like forgetting your keys, blanking on the name of a celebrity, or walking into a room and not remembering why you entered. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER \"But if you're seeing that happen much more frequently over time and it’s getting worse, that might suggest there issomething neurodegenerativeand not just normal or typical aging,\" Salinas advised. To help ensure earlier diagnosis and intervention, Salinas recommends speaking with a healthcare provider as soon as atypical symptoms are noticed. \"Not all doctors or medical providers are the same,\" the neurologist said. \"A common story we hear is that people’s symptoms get dismissed.\"(AP Photo/Charles Dharapak, File) \"It’s important to take them seriously — but not alldoctors or medical providersare the same,\" he cautioned. \"A common story we hear is that people’s symptoms get dismissed.\" In this case, Salinas suggests getting a second opinion, preferably from a neurology specialist.

Sanders, 23, was asked who his top four quarterback-wide receiver duos are of all time. \"Tom (Brady) and (Rob Gronkowski), of course, but’s (Gronkowski is a) tight end. \"I liked Aaron Rodgers and Davante Adams, I like Chris Olave and Derek Carr,\" Sanders said during a recent appearance on \"The Rush with Maxx Crosby.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders speaks during a press conference at the NFL football scouting combine, Feb. 28, 2025, in Indianapolis.(AP Photo/George Walker IV) \"Whoever going to be the quarterback for DK Metcalf and George Pickens, whoever that is,\" Sanders said as his fourth quarterback-wide receiver duo. Metcalf and Pickens are both wide receivers for thePittsburgh Steelers. Sanders has been linked to the Steelers in the days and weeks leading up to theNFL Draftas the team does not have a long-term answer at the quarterback position on the roster. Even if the Steelers end up signing free agent quarterback Aaron Rodgers, they could still select Sanders with the No. 21 overall pick in the first round as Rodgers would only be a short-term solution. NFL INSIDER WARNS TEAMS OF POSSIBLE DEION SANDERS FACTOR IF SHEDEUR SANDERS IS TAKEN IN DRAFT Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders(AP Photo/David Zalubowski/File) The caveat for the Steelers is Sanders may not fall to them at No. 21. TheNew York Giantshave spent extensive time scouting the Colorado quarterback, and the New Orleans Saints have been tied to Sanders in lieu of the injury news surrounding Derek Carr. The Giantsand Saintspick No. 3 and No. 9 overall, respectively, and if the Steelers fear Sanders may be taken before them at No. 21, they would be forced to go in another direction or trade up to secure Sanders. The only two quarterbacks currently on the Steelers roster are Mason Rudolph and Skylar Thompson.

Last seasonwith Colorado, Sanders threw for 4,314 yards and 37 touchdowns with 10 interceptions, helping lead the Buffaloes to a 9-4 record and a bowl game appearance. Sanders’ play is a big reason the team improved to 9-4 after going 4-8 the prior season; Colorado was 1-11 the year before the Sanders family came over.

    "article_text": "XX-XY Athletics founder Jennifer Sey on Washington State failing to pass proposals to protect girls' sports and a report that former President Joe Biden secretly believed that trans athletes shouldn't compete alongside women. EXCLUSIVE:Rep. Mary Miller, R-Ill., called on PresidentDonald Trump'sadministration to take action against her state. In a letter obtained by Fox News Digital addressed to the Departments of Education and Justice, Miller pleaded for the agencies to investigate after the Illinois High School Association (IHSA) said it wouldcontinue allowing trans athletesto compete in girls' sports. \"I am writing to express my deep concern regarding a recent decision by the Illinois High School Association (IHSA), which has chosen to blatantly disregard federal law and reject basic biological reality by allowing biological males to compete in girls’ athletic programs. This misguided policy not only undermines the integrity and fairness of girls’ sports, but it also jeopardizes the safety of young women across our state,\" Miller wrote. \"I respectfully urge the Department of Justice and the Department of Education to investigate the actions of IHSA and the State of Illinois and take appropriate measures to ensure that federal civil rights protections are upheld.\" TEEN GIRLS OPEN UP ON TRANS ATHLETE SCANDAL THAT TURNED THEIR HIGH SCHOOL INTO A CULTURE WAR BATTLEGROUND Miller provided a statement to Fox News Digital addressing the letter, and condemning Gov. J.B. Pritzker. \"I’m calling on Attorney General Pam Bondi and Secretary Linda McMahon to launch an immediate investigation into the IHSA and the State of Illinois. Gov. J.B. Pritzker and radical Illinois Democrats must be held accountable for enforcing abusive, anti-science gender policies ahead of the safety of our daughters and the fairness of girls’ sports,\" Miller said. Transgender athletes have been permitted to compete in girls' sports in Illinois since 2011. Illinois became one of the many blue states to openly defy Trump's \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports\" executive order after it was signed on Feb. 5. In a public letter to state GOP lawmakers last week, the IHSA said Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and the Illinois Department of Human Rights have declared that state law requires that transgender athletes be allowed to participate based on gender identity. The IHSA cited the state's human rights laws as a barrier to banning biological males from girls' sports. That letter came in response to GOP lawmakers sending their own letter to the IHSA in March asking what the body would do to change policy after Trump’s executive order passed. MAINE GIRL INVOLVED IN TRANS ATHLETE BATTLE REVEALS HOW STATE'S POLICIES HURT HER CHILDHOOD AND SPORTS CAREER Trans flag and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker(Getty Images) \"The Illinois High School Association has crossed a dangerous line. By blatantly violating federal law and rejecting biological reality, they are not only undermining fairness in girls’ sports – they’re putting the safety of young women at risk,\" Miller told Fox News Digital. A federal Title IX investigation is already underway in Illinois after a Deerfield mother alleged her daughter was forced to change in front of a trans student. Deerfield Public Schools District 109 is facing a probe by the U.S.Department of Education'sOffice of Civil Rights after Illinois mother Nicole Georgas brought light to the situation. Georgas has now told Fox News Digital she is also worried about her daughter's athletic future because of the IHSA's ruling. \"Imagine your daughter, dedicating her life, training for years, hours and hours a week, for her championship state race, only to face a male beating her and winning that coveted scholarship. How is that at all fair? Our daughter’s dedication to athletics is slowly being erased,\" Georgas said. Deerfield Public Schools District 109 responded to the investigation in a statement to Fox News Digital and, like the IHSA, cited the Illinois Human Rights Act for its protocols. \"Deerfield Public Schools District 109 complies with state law. The Illinois Human Rights Act prohibits allpublic school districtsfrom discriminating on the basis of sex, including gender identity, and mandates that students must be permitted access to the locker room and bathroom that aligns with their gender identity,\" the statement said. Meanwhile, Maine has already seen the type of intervention that Miller is calling for. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP That state has seen its federal funding cut by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and theDepartment of Justicehas launched a lawsuit against it for continued defiance of Trump's order. Maine has launched its own lawsuit against the Trump administration over the funding freeze, and a federal judge has ruled it be unfrozen. ANew York Times/Ipsos surveyfound the vast majority of Americans, including a majority of Democrats, don't think transgender athletes should be permitted to compete in women's sports. Of the 2,128 people who participated, 79% said biological males who identify as women should not be allowed to participate in women's sports. Of the 1,025 people who identified as Democrats or leaning Democratic, 67% said transgender athletes should not be allowed to compete with women.

    "title": "First autonomous AI agent is here, but is it worth the risks?",
    "article_text": "\"The Big Weekend Show\" analyzes the possibilities of artificial intelligence when it comes to influencing voters. If you haven’t heard the buzz about Manus yet, it's the new AI model unveiled by a Singapore-based company called Butterfly Effect. This isn’t just another chatbot. It’s one of the first truly autonomous AI agents, able to do its own research, make decisions and even carry out plans, all with barely any human oversight. Sounds impressive, right? But here’s the thing: While all this innovation opens up exciting possibilities, it also brings some serious privacy and security questions. Whether you’re eager to try out the latest AI or you’d rather steer clear, it’s worth understanding what Manus could mean for your personal data and digital safety. STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS – SIGN UP FOR KURT’S ‘THE CYBERGUY REPORT’ NOW First truly autonomous AI agent (Manus)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) This has already been happening for a while with other AI models. There have beenseveral class-action lawsuitsagainst tech companies for scraping personal data foruse in AI training, with one lawsuit claiming that OpenAI uses \"stolen private information, including personally identifiable information, from hundreds of millions of internet users, including children of all ages, without their informed knowledge or consent.\" Many companies also sell or share data with third parties, including for the purposes of AI training. For example, X has been using personal data to train its AI, Grok, and is also sharing user data with third parties to train AI models. So whether you use AI (includingManus AIwhen it’s released to the public) or not, there’s still a good chance that they have your personal information. First truly autonomous AI agent (Manus)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) GOOGLE'S NEW AI TECH MAY KNOW WHEN YOUR HOUSE WILL BURN DOWN It boils down to data privacy and security. When AI companies collect personal information – things like your name, email address, home location, social media posts and even photos – they often store it in large databases to train their models. If those databases aren’t properly secured, they can become gold mines for hackers. Think of them as digital \"honey pots\": sweet and tempting to cybercriminals because of all the personal data inside. This isn’t just a theoretical risk. Just this year, another AI company,DeepSeek, experienced a major leak that exposed more than a million sensitive records. When this kind of information gets out, it can end up on the dark web where scammers and identity thieves are more than happy to scoop it up. That’s how people end up dealing with everything from identity theft and impersonation to tons of spam calls, phishing emails and targeted scams. But data leaks aren’t the only danger. Even when the information is secure, it can be misused or manipulated in ways that are hard to detect. One of the biggest new threats is something called a prompt injection attack. In simple terms, prompt injection is a way for attackers to trick an AI into doing something it wasn’t supposed to. Researchers recently found that attackers can embed hidden commands in seemingly harmless text, like a website bio, email signature or even a social media post. When the AI reads that text during training or browsing, it can accidentally follow the hidden instructions, which might tell it to leak information, change how it behaves or give unauthorized access to private data. First truly autonomous AI agent (Manus)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) DANGERS OF OVER-SHARING WITH AI TOOLS Unlike most AI tools that respond to commands you give them directly, Manus is autonomous, meaning it can act on its own, follow links, read content and make decisions without human approval. While that sounds pretty cool, it’s also what makes it a lot harder to spot when something goes wrong. If Manus encounters malicious content, it could unknowingly follow a hidden prompt, compromise your data or alter its behavior, and there may be no obvious sign that anything has happened until it’s too late. There are also some concerns about where Manus sends and stores data. Security researchers have traced data back to servers in Shenzhen, China, raising red flags about surveillance, jurisdiction and who might ultimately have access to your information. So even if Manus isn’t scraping anything too sensitive today, the combination of weak oversight, powerful automation and questionable data practices makes it far riskier than your average AI assistant. We reached out to Manus AI for a comment on this article but did not hear back before our deadline. First truly autonomous AI agent (Manus)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) GENAI, THE FUTURE OF FRAUD AND WHY YOU MAY BE AN EASY TARGET As I’ve mentioned, whether you use Manus AI or not, your personal information will still likely end up in its datasets, so the best way to protect yourself is to make your information difficult to find. Here are some things you can do. 1) Be cautious about using Manus:With that level of autonomy, especially since it’s a very new AI (not to mention the inconsistency in its privacy policy regarding governance), I wouldn’t recommend using it quite yet. There’s just too much damage it can do if it malfunctions or is subject to a prompt injection attack. 2) Keep your personal information under wraps:With so many companies selling and trading personal information, many of them to tech companies to train AI, it’s a good idea to withhold your data unless you absolutely can’t avoid sharing it. 3) Actively remove your personal information from the internet so your data can’t be scraped by AI models like Manus:Set your social media to private, limit data collection through privacy settings and remove your information from data brokers and people-search sites. Autonomous cloud-based agents such as Manus are designed to extract and analyze vast amounts of online data, and your publicly available information can be swept into their training datasets without your knowledge or consent. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.Check out my top picks for data removal services here. 4) Use strong antivirus software to help defend against the broader attack surface created by autonomous AI systems:Manus’ ability to act independently and interact with external systems increases the risk of adversarial attacks and malware transmission, so robust endpoint security is essential to protect your devices and data. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. 5) Use privacy-focused products and services:Whenever you cannot avoid sharing personal information, opt for companies that prioritize your privacy. For example, use the DuckDuckGo browser instead of Chrome and Brave or Proton Mail instead of Gmail.Check out the best private and safe browser alternatives to Google. 6) Keep all software updated, including your operating system, browsers and security tools, to patch vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit:As AI agents like Manus operate in the cloud and may interact with your systems, unpatched software can become an easy target for exploitation or unauthorized access. Therefore, it's always a good idea to keep software, operating systems, browsers and security toolsupdated at all times. 7) Enable multifactor authentication (MFA) on all your accounts:As AI-driven attacks and automated data extraction become more common,MFAadds a crucial layer of defense, making it much harder for attackers to compromise your accounts, even if an AI system leaks or scrapes your credentials. 8) Use strong, unique passwords for every account:As cloud-based AI agents like Manus can interact with external systems and potentially access sensitive data, unique passwords help prevent a breach of one account from leading to a broader compromise. Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about mybest expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here. As we move forward with AI like Manus, it’s exciting to think about the possibilities, but it's also important to keep our eyes open about what it means for our personal data. Even if you never use Manus yourself, your info could still end up in its training data. So what can you do? Stay informed, take charge of your digital footprint and choose tools that prioritize your privacy. As AI keeps evolving, being proactive about your data is the best way to enjoy the benefits of innovation while keeping your personal info safe. Do you think companies behind powerful AI agents like Manus should be required to follow stricter privacy rules and independent oversight before they’re allowed to collect and use people’s data?

    "title": "Robotic and drone tech make fruit picking and handling easier",
    "article_text": "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson discusses how robots and drones are revolutionizing fruit farming with faster picking and smarter handling. Farming is undergoing a remarkable transformation thanks to cutting-edge technologies reshaping how fruit is picked and handled. While autonomous drones like Tevel’s Flying Robots are already harvesting fruit globally, innovations like UC San Diego’s GRIP-tape gripper represent the next frontier in gentle produce handling. Together, these advancements promise to make fruit production more efficient and precise, though one is a proven solution and the other is a glimpse into farming’s future. STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS – SIGN UP FOR KURT’S ‘THE CYBERGUY REPORT’ NOW Flying autonomous robot drone (Tevel)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) Tevel’s Flying Autonomous Robots (FARs)are redefining fruit harvesting by combining artificial intelligence with advanced computer vision. These drones navigate through orchards, identifying and picking only the fruit that has reached peak ripeness. Their ability to maneuver carefully around branches allows them to harvest without bruising or harming the trees. Unlike human pickers, these drones can operate continuously, working day and night to get the job done faster and more consistently. Farmers benefit from detailed, real-time information about the harvest, including the size, color and ripeness of each fruit, all accessible through a mobile app. This data helps optimize harvesting schedules and reduce waste. FARs have already been deployed in orchards across the United States, Italy, Chile and Israel, where they have helped reduce labor costs by up to 30% while improving harvest accuracy. Multiple drones work together from a mobile platform, covering large orchard areas efficiently. Beyond picking, these robots also detect diseases and track the location of each fruit bin, providing farmers with valuable insights to manage their crops better. Flying autonomous robot drone (Tevel)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) IS THIS ROBOT AFTER OUR HOSPITALITY, RETAIL, HEALTHCARE JOBS? While Tevel’s drones tackle harvesting,UC San Diego’s GRIP-tape gripperremains in the experimental stage as a solution for post-harvest handling. Inspired by steel measuring tapes, this prototype uses layered \"fingers\" to grasp delicate fruits gently. Early tests show promise in handling objects like lemons and tomatoes without damage, but it has yet to be widely adopted in farming. The gripper’s motorized reels allow its tape-based fingers to extend, rotate and convey items like a conveyor belt. Researchers highlight its low cost and safety around humans, but further development is needed to integrate it into commercial packing lines or harvesters. GRIP-tape gripper (UC San Diego)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) SMARTER DAIRY FARMS WHERE ROBOTS MILK THE COWS Tevel’s drones are already transforming orchards, while the GRIP-tape gripper offers a vision of how delicate produce handling could evolve. The combination of real-world automation and experimental robotics highlights both the immediate benefits and long-term potential of agritech innovation. GRIP-tape gripper (UC San Diego)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) ROBOT USES LASERS TO MAKE CHEMICAL-FREE FARMING A REALITY As we watch technology take on more roles in farming, it’s clear that drones like Tevel’s are already making a real difference in how fruit gets harvested. Meanwhile, concepts like the GRIP-tape gripper show us what might be just around the corner, a gentler, smarter way to handle delicate produce. There’s plenty of potential ahead, and it will be interesting to see how these technologies continue to evolve and work together to support farmers and the food we all enjoy.

    "title": "Antisemitism on Campus: The high school front line since October 7",
    "article_text": "Resource specialist teacher Barry Blisten joins ‘Fox News @ Night’ to warn about the United Teachers Los Angeles union and its alleged embrace of antisemitism and divisive politics. Since the horrors of Oct. 7, 2023, Jewish high schoolers across North America have faced a drastically altered reality, marked by fear, hostility and asurge in antisemitism. At NCSY, we work with tens of thousands of Jewish teens nationwide, and what we’re seeing today is not just troubling, it’s unprecedented in this country. What once might have been subtle slights or awkward silences from peers has, for many students, turned into open hostility. Students are being isolated, intimidated, and even harassed and threatened simply for being Jewish or expressing support for Israel, which was viciously attacked on Oct. 7 and has subsequently been fighting to release hostages and prevent future attacks. \"Students have been told \"Hitler should have finished the job\" or called \"dirty Jew.\" In Houston, a teacher accused a Jewish teen of being a \"baby killer\". Numerous stories reflect the complacency of school leadership and a breakdown in the values our schools are meant to uphold. \" TRUMP ADMIN WON’T TOLERATE ANTISEMITISM IN SCHOOLS, SAYS LEO TERRELL AS NYC SCHOOLS UNDER MICROSCOPE Anti- Israel protesters stand outside Susan E. Wagner High School in Staten Island.(Ary Weiss/Staten Island Shomrim) TheAnti-Defamation League’s 2024 auditunderscores this surge, reporting 9,354 antisemitic incidents across the U.S., a 140% increase over 2023 and the highest since tracking began in 1979. This includes harassment, vandalism and assaults, mostly in schools and colleges. Hate speech and intimidation have become disturbingly normalized. High school is a time for growth and personal development, which schools have a responsibility to help foster. Yet since Oct. 7, many Jewish students have instead been put in the position of defending their identity, often without guidance or institutional support. When schools fail to act, they signal that this hate is somehow less urgent. At NCSY, we are committed to ensuring that no student feels alone. Through ourJewish Student Union(JSU) clubs in over 400 public schools across North America, we give students a space to process what they’re experiencing, connect with others who understand, and develop the strength to stand tall in their Jewish identity. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Students have shown something remarkable: resilience, pride, and an unshakable connection to Jewish values and peoplehood.(Jason Redmond/AFP via Getty Images) We also provide leadership training, Israel education, and guidance on how to address antisemitism with confidence and dignity. These students aren’t just victims of hate, they are American Jewish leaders in the making and powerful voices of moral clarity and courage. It is unacceptable for schools to be silent or neutral in the face of antisemitism. Schools have a responsibility to act with clarity and consistency when addressing antisemitism. That means updating anti-harassment policies to reflect today’s realities, training staff to identify modern forms of antisemitism, includinganti-Zionist rhetoric, and fostering an environment where Jewish identity is respected. Parents, educators and community leaders must also stay engaged. Listening to students and taking their concerns seriously is critical. Their stories are not exaggerations; they are early warnings that deserve thoughtful, compassionate responses. Oct. 7 didn’t just shake Israel, it shook Jewish identity around the world when Jews saw pro-Hamas rallies conducted across the country before Israel had even responded to the attacks against it. For Jewish high schoolers in the U.S., the aftershocks are still being felt daily. But rather than shrink in the face of this pressure, students have shown something remarkable: resilience, pride, and an unshakable connection to Jewish values and peoplehood.

    "title": "DAVID MARCUS: If we can’t deport illegals, here's how we can make it impossible to stay",
    "article_text": "Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss his take on the dissent and why he believes frustration is on the rise as the Trump administration continues to crack down on illegal immigration. There’s an old saying when a bar is about to close for the night that goes something like, \"you don’t have to go home, but you can’t stay here.\" It pretty much sums up how Americans feel about people in our country illegally, even if ourcourts won’t let President Trump deport them. It's truly incredible. President Biden allowed millions of illegals to pour across the southern border en masse and the courts did nothing. Now, in order to kick them out, the same judicial system wantseach and every one to get a hearing, a process that would likely require not decades, but centuries. PRESIDENT TRUMP BLASTS COURTS FOR GETTING IN WAY OF DEPORTATION AGENDA To get a notion of the scale here, some estimates sayBiden let 10 million people enter the county illegally. Were they to stand in a single file line, it would stretch from New York to Los Angeles. Of course, what this really means is that if the courts get their way, and every person must have a scheduled hearing, then almost everyone gets to stay indefinitely. This didn’t happen when Democratic presidents Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, or even Open Borders Biden himself deported illegals. Yet somehow, now that it's Trump, the rules are entirely different. Never mind that polling now consistently shows growing majorities of Americans want all undocumented aliens booted, and not just those with criminal records. As Democrats and media outlets clamor for the return of a supposedly innocent Salvadoran migrant named Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was deported to a maximum-security prison in his home country, publicly available domestic violence court records cast doubt on the media narrative about his innocence.(Alex Peña/Getty Images; Fox News) Fine, there are other ways to handle this influx of illegals, but not everyone is going to like them very much. Here’s an idea: Any person or company who hires an illegal, knowingly or unknowingly, pays a $25,000 fine, per person. This would apply not only to faceless corporations, but to any rich couple from the Hamptons to Beverly Hills who hires an illegal immigrant nanny or landscaper. Feel free to put the \"Refugees Welcome\" sign in your window, but be prepared to pay up. There must also be a complete and total shutdown of any and all federal benefits going to those in the country illegally. The judiciary may be able to stop us from kicking illegals out of the country, but they can’t force us to buy their food and pay their rent. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The pro-open borders side loves to talk about the golden age of Ellis Island, when half of Europe seemed to pass by the Statue of Liberty in search of a new life. But guess what? None of those 12 million souls got a dime of federal benefits. The message to those in our country illegally is clear, \"you don't have to go home, but you can’t stay here.\" No, a century ago, it was family, local communities and churches that helped the newest immigrants get on their feet, and if they couldn’t get on their feet, they went home. They couldn’t just live indefinitely as a ward of the state. The message should be clear that if you are here illegally and you choose to stay, it will be in a tent on Skid Row. You see how this works? When the courts, sanctuary cities, and the media all work to ensure illegals get to stay, the country must find other ways to fix this problem. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP By hook or by crook, the American people are going to take their country back. This is the greatest nation on earth, not a pay-what-you-wish youth hostel open to the world. It's time to start flashing the lights on and off.

    "title": "Can President Trump fix Harvard?",
    "article_text": "American Culture Project senior fellow Corey DeAngelis reacts to the White House’s controversial decision to freeze over $2 billion in federal funding going to Harvard. Public trust in our universities is lower than it’s ever been, with 32 percent of Americans having \"very little to no confidence\" in higher education. That’s up from 20 percent before October 7, 2023, when the higher-ed crisis was thrust into the national discourse by virulent pro-Hamas protests and encampments. It’s amazing that the heart of antisemitism in America lies on campus, among the most educated and so-called progressive people in the country. As Bill Ackman put it in a revelatory essay the dayHarvard presidentClaudine Gay resigned, antisemitism is the \"canary in the coal mine,\" a warning about larger issues. It’s a leading indicator of underlying pathologies, which here means everything from cancel culture to ideological indoctrination, intellectual corruption to moral decay. We’ve seen a subversion of the core mission of universities to seek truth and knowledge, and of classical-liberal values like free speech, due process, and equality under the law. It’s been a shift from education to activism. The root cause of all of this is a noxious postmodern ideology that contends that truth is subjective and must be viewed through lenses of race, gender, and other identity categories, according to some privilege hierarchy. Your rights and freedoms depend on whether you’re part of a class deemed oppressor or oppressed. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PLANS TO PULL $1 BILLION IN FUNDING FROM HARVARD AMID CLASH WITH UNIVERSITY: REPORT After the Trump administration demanded thatHarvard addressits rampant antisemitism, end racial discrimination in admissions and hiring, curtail political litmus tests for faculty, ensure open academic inquiry, and otherwise reform its governance structures and processes, the university’s leadership indignantly rebuffed the government. Alan Garber, Harvard’s president, wrote that \"No government—regardless of which party is in power—should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.\" The administration responded by announcing a freeze on multi-year grants and contracts worth $2.2 billion and $60 million, respectively. The only thing surprising about these developments is that they took so long. What we’re seeing isn’t the decades-old conservative complaint about liberal professors, but weak leadership that placates the illiberal left that now drives campus culture.University officialsfacilitate and even foment social-justice mobs who would consider the Berkeley Free Speech Movement, which sparked universities’ leftward turn in the 1960s, to be a bastion of white supremacy. Federal law is meant to prevent such things, at least at schools that accept the copious strings that come with federal funding. That includes everything from accounting standards to prevent waste and fraud to basic civil-rights obligations.Harvardhas been lax on complying with these requirements. Indeed, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression named Harvard the worst school in the country for free speech for the second straight year. Of course, there are certain federal demands that Harvard has been more than happy to accommodate. These range from the Obama-era \"Dear Colleague\" letter suggesting that schools remove due-process protections for sexual-harassment allegations to the Biden administration’s insinuation of DEI commissars into every nook and cranny of university governance. The Trump administration’s focus, on the other hand, is on fighting the far-Left illiberalism that has especially pervaded \"elite\" places like Harvard. Its demands include increasing discipline for faculty, administrators, and students engaged in racism and antisemitism. Earlier this year, Harvard settled several (but not all) lawsuits by agreeing to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance when evaluating complaints of bullying, providing training on antisemitism to staff who review discrimination complaints, and undisclosed monetary payments. It’s understandable that the government sees these as largely cosmetic reforms, particularly given the spectacular failures of an earlier antisemitism advisory group and task force (created in parallel with one on anti-Muslim bias, of course). CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION But theTrump demandsaren’t merely a response to post-October 7 events. They also enforce the Supreme Court’s 2023 ruling in Students for Fair Admission v. Harvard, which found racial preferences in admissions to be unconstitutional. While promising to abide by that ruling, Harvard reaffirmed its commitment to diversity while seeking illegal proxies to maintain racialist policies (which have decreased Jewish enrollment). The Claudine Gay scandal, even beyond her plagiarism, crystallized the larger problem. Gay is a mediocre academic who was elevated for advancing progressive orthodoxy while checking intersectional boxes. She is the apotheosis of an anti-intellectual movement that values identity and activism over merit and education. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But Gay’s resignation didn’t end Harvard’s troubles. The school is still plagued by a toxic culture, ideological corruption, and bureaucratic bloat that stifle open inquiry and free discourse. There may be schools that are worse on these measures—Columbia comes to mind, although it recently agreed to implement reforms at the behest of another federal investigation—but Harvard is the biggest and richest \"brand\" in American higher-ed, and thus a fitting target. It doesn’t take long to destroy reputations built over decades and centuries. The question is whether higher-education grandees are willing to \"do the work\" to restore their tarnished stature. There’s still a long way to go before universities return to their mission of seeking truth and conveying knowledge, but the Trump administration is trying to get them there.

    "article_text": "OutKick founder Clay Travis and Fox News senior political analyst Juan Williams join 'MediaBuzz' to discuss President Donald Trump's feud with the chair of the Federal Reserve. PresidentDonald Trumpwants to fire Jerome Powell, chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. No word yet on what Powell thinks about Trump’s job performance, but Powell says he doesn’t intend to quit before the end of his term next year. If Trump does try to fire him, he’ll see Trump in court. It’s a mess. It’s like being a little kid in abig crazy familywatching the grown-ups have a nasty, screaming fight in front of the neighbors. It’s embarrassing. But it’s more than that. This big crazy family needs the neighbors – which includes everyone in the world who participates in our financial system – more than ever. There’s probably not much we can do about the fight. The grown-ups clearly don’t care much about us kids – if they did, they’d quit fighting and figure all this out. But it might be helpful to understand what the fight is about and how it could be easily resolved. President Donald Trump looks on as Jerome Powell, his nominee for Federal Reserve chairman, takes to the podium during a press event in the Rose Garden at the White House, Nov. 2, 2017. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) Behind all the details there is one huge problem: the grown-ups are bad with money. Real bad. The last several presidents and Congresses, have racked up something like $37 trillion in debt, most of it owed to the people watching in horror as the fight over the Fed gets ugly. As more and more of them conclude this is a badly dysfunctional family – something already on every neighbor’s minds – it’s going to be harder and more expensive to finance all that debt. TRUMP SLAMS JEROME POWELL AS 'MR. TOO LATE,' CALLS FED CHAIRMAN A 'MAJOR LOSER' As you would expect, there’s a political part of the fight. Trump thinks Powell has just one job, which is to do whatever Trump tells him to do. But that’s wrong. TheFederal Reserveis created by Congress. Powell is supposed to do what Congress tells him to do. And right there in 12 U.S.C. § 225a Congress has ordered the Fed to promote \"maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.\" That seems clear enough until you turn to Section 10, where Congress tells the president he has the duty to appoint the chair of the Fed. Trump claims that this must mean he also has the power to fire the chair. If this was a simple power struggle, it wouldn’t matter all that much. But Trump alsostarted an economic fightin January when, in his inauguration speech, he promised to \"overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families. Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens.\" AMERICA CAN RETURN TO FISCAL SANITY WITH STRONG FEDERAL RESERVE LEADERSHIP AND TRUMP BACK IN THE WHITE HOUSE So far Trump has been inconsistent in honoring that promise. On April 2 he announced his massive \"liberation day\" tariffs. On April 9, he suspended the tariffs. He said China was a big problem that required the U.S. to imposemassive new tariffs. Then he suspended those tariffs on electronic goods. You might think that if the president is talking and not doing, things can’t go too badly. Maybe his advisors are keeping him from doing any real harm. If only. In fact, the uncertainty is almost worse. Businesses can’t brace themselves for one threat, they must worry about them all. TRUMP CRANKS UP HEAT ON FED CHAIR WHILE PRESSING FOR RATE CUT: 'POWELL’S TERMINATION CANNOT COME FAST ENOUGH!' Powell is in an even tougher spot. His mandate –low inflationand low unemployment – are tough enough without a president who thinks he can \"overhaul our trade system.\" It’s nearly impossible with a president who keeps changing his mind about how to do it. This whole thing is especially annoying to economists. We can see the damage already being done when we look at the bad stuff happening in bond and currency markets. And we know there’s an easy solution: put a computer in charge of the Fed. Seriously. Fire Powell, tell Trump he’s got an early tee time and then program a few simple rules into a computer. Let the machine set interest rates and control the money supply. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER For at least the past 40 years,smart economistshave been debating \"rules versus discretion.\" The question is whether the work of the Fed – influencing interest rates and so forth – should be done by smart people who adjust to circumstances or well-trained clerks who make sure the rules programmed into a computer are followed. (If you want an example of how this could work, check out something called the \"Taylor Rule.\") Rule-following clerks work OK when the rules programmed into the computers are appropriate to the circumstances. But what about when the current economic circumstances don’t fit the rules? That’s when you want smart people with the discretion to adapt to circumstances. But what if the people we pick are (a) smart but can’t quite grasp changing circumstances, (b) smart but driven by short-term political concerns or (c) not very smart. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP This debate about rules versus discretion is fun for the nerds in the economics department. But the chaos created by this loud obnoxious power struggle has taken us way past that. Even if the computer isn’t as good as the people, it’s predictable.

    "title": "Congress can stop California's radical environmental mandates that hurt the entire nation",
    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has launched an inspiring effort to regain sanity in our nation’s energy policies. One of his initiatives is particularly important — reversing the Biden administration’s attempt to superchargeCalifornia’s electric-vehicle mandates,which would allow that state to push a radical transformation of our nation’s fleet from gas-powered to electric. Congress has an opportunity for a policy and constitutional win here. The reversal of Biden and California’s undemocratic effort is now on the five-yard line. To score, Congress needs to punch through one more bureaucratic agency. Over the last several years, California has tried to aggressively export itsprogressive energy ideology,leading to a wide number of short-sighted and unconstitutional policies. Near the top of the list are California’s bureaucratically crafted electric-vehicle mandates, some of which seek to transform the nation’s heavy-duty fleet from diesel-based to electric. California’s attempt to drive national policy would normally run into both constitutional (interstate commerce clause) and statutory (Clean Air Act) roadblocks. Unfortunately, the Biden Environmental Protection Agency attempted to bless California’s overreach by granting so-called Clean Air Act \"preemption waivers\" tothree electric-vehicle mandatespassed by unelected California bureaucrats. TRUMP ADMIN TOUTS ENERGY COMEBACK These waivers give California a Sword of Damocles to hang over the industry. Nebraska has fought back, leading a three-part battle by filing lawsuits against California, the Biden-era mandates and the trucking companies that agreed to eliminate consumer choice in the trucking market. EPA chief Lee Zeldin is already going after California's energy waivers. It's a good start.(Getty Images) The good news is that the Trump administration is pushing common-sense energy policies, and Zeldin has taken the first necessary step to repeal the waivers. Under the Congressional Review Act, Congress can repeal EPA’s waivers by passing a resolution of disapproval through simple majorities in the House and Senate plus the president’s signature. President Donald Trump’s promise to unleash American energy by rescinding radical electric-vehicle mandates — combined with Republican majorities in both houses of Congress — make a legislative repeal a no-brainer. Nebraskans are grateful that our two United States Senators, Deb Fischer and Pete Ricketts, are helping to lead the charge for energy policy sanity. Now there’s a roadblock. A nonbinding opinion from the Government Accountability Office judged that the California waivers are not \"rules\" of \"general applicability\" subject to review under the Congressional Review Act. That opinion is wrong. The California waivers are \"rules\" because they enact forward-looking policy decisions. And the waivers are \"generally applicable\" because they reach well beyond California’s borders. Even if one ignores the obvious nationwide (if not worldwide) implications of mandating electric vehicles in the fifth-largest economy in the world, the California waivers are generally applicable because they allow other states to enact electric-vehicle mandates they otherwise could not. Under the Clean Air Act, only Congress can set emission standards for new motor vehicles. The sole exception is California, which can seek a waiver from EPA to enforce emission standards more stringent than the federal ones. But once California gets a waiver, any of the other 49 states can \"adopt and enforce\" emission standards \"identical to the California standards for which a waiver has been granted\" without asking EPA for permission. So far, 18 states have adopted at least one of California’s electric-vehicle mandates. The Biden-era waiver paves the way for a widespread adoption of California’s bans on internal-combustion engines. This is precisely the kind of agency action that falls within the purview of the Congressional Review Act. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Finding that the waivers are subject to the CRA is both a lawful and commonsense exercise of congressional authority. The GAO — headed by an Obama appointee — broke its own precedent in issuing nonbinding \"observations\" on whether the California waivers are subject to the CRA. Never before had the GAO opined on an agency action that an agency already submitted for CRA review. The GAO itself has said that, once an agency action has been submitted to Congress for CRA review, there are \"no impediments to Congress’s exercise of those powers that could be cured by an opinion from GAO.\" Procedural irregularities aside, the GAO’s opinion is substantively flawed. It fails to mention that once California gets a waiver, every other state can adopt emission standards identical to the California standards, giving the waivers nationwide effect. The California waivers are \"rules\" because they enact forward-looking policy decisions. And the waivers are \"generally applicable\" because they reach well beyond California’s borders. Accepting the GAO’s novel observations here would effectively give unelected bureaucrats the final say on whether elected lawmakers get to review sweeping regulatory decisions — decisions that impact the national economy, consumer choice and federalism itself. If Congress defers here, it risks outsourcing democratic oversight of major national policy to technical advisors. That would weaken our constitutional protections. The Republican Party has claimed unified control of the federal government only five times in the past 100 years. Using that control to repeal California’s waivers is both a policy and constitutional win. Elected representatives in Congress, not unelected bureaucrats in Sacramento or a so-called \"independent\" agency like GAO, have the power to regulate the means of interstate commerce. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Deferring to the GAO would be an undemocratic trifecta — it would leave in place rules written by unelected state regulators, approved by unelected federal bureaucrats and shielded from democratic review through unelected, self-declared referees. That’s not how a representative government is supposed to work. Repealing the waivers would do more than block a radical climate agenda — it would restore a basic principle of American self-government: that laws with national scope must be subject to national debate, national scrutiny, and national consent. Congress has the authority to act, and I urge it to use that authority and repeal these short-sighted waivers. Mike Hilgers is Nebraska's 33rd attorney general.

IBM had 15 of its federal contracts canceled due to DOGE-related cuts during the first quarter of 2025, according to reporting fromReutersandBloomberg. These cuts amount to $100 million in future payments, per Bloomberg. Federal contracts represent between 5% and just under 10% of IBM’s consulting practice. After being peppered with questions during IBM’s earnings call Wednesday, Arvind Krishna, IBM’s CEO, clarified that the cancellations were related to cutbacks at USAID. Both Krishna and James Kavanaugh, IBM’s CFO, then proceeded to downplay the potential impact of DOGE on the company’s future business. “We’ve had a handful of contracts, either statement of work, or cancel and on our annualized backlog of over $30 billion in total consulting,” Kavanaugh said. “This is like less than $100 million of backlog over a duration of multiple years. So while no one’s immune, we are absolutely focused on monitoring the identity dynamic process. We’re prudently cautious around consulting for the year.” IBM’s consulting business made up 34% of the company’s revenue in Q1. Krishna added that the company’s federal government consulting contracts largely focus on crucial areas. “The vast majority is critical work — we actually process veterans benefit claims,” Krishna said. “We help process how the [General Services Administration] does procurement. We help implement payroll systems. I don’t think of these as optional. Now, are there some areas around the edges which could be viewed as discretionary? Yes. But in our case that is the minority of our business, not the majority.” IBM’s consulting revenue was down 2% overall in Q1, according to the company’s first-quarter results. Revenue from consulting in Q1 was slightly over $5 billion. “The diversity across our business positions us well to navigate the current climate,” Krishna said. “Our portfolio and track record of execution reinforce my confidence on this next chapter of our growth.

Windsurf said it’s getting rid of its complex system of “flow action credits,” which charged developers for actions its AI did in the background. It’s also cutting prices for its team plans to $30 per user per month down from $35, while making its enterprise plans “much cheaper,” per the announcement. Windsurf product marketer Rob Houproclaimed on Xthat Windsurf now has “BY FAR the best and most affordable pricing structure of all AI coding tools on the market,” crediting this to Windsurf optimizing its GPU usage. Hou criticized “confusing” competitor plans priced at $20 a month in an apparent dig at Cursor’s individual monthly plan, which starts at $20 compared to Windsurf’s $15. The pricing overhaul comes as Windsurf is reportedlybeing considered for an acquisition by OpenAI for $3 billion(Cursor’s creator Anysphereis in talks to raise at a $10 billion valuation). As TechCrunch previously reported, Windsurf is the smaller of the two coding assistant startups, generating about $100 million in ARRcompared to Cursor’s $300 million. OpenAIoriginally wanted to buy Cursor, but it’s growing so quickly that it’s not in the market to be sold. Although Windsurf hasn’t confirmed the OpenAI acquisition reports, it has recently stepped up its public collaborations with OpenAI. For example,Windsurf’s CEO Varun Mohan appeared earlier this monthin OpenAI’s launch video for its latest API model family. And as part of the pricing change announcement, Windsurf is lavishing its users with another week of free and unlimited usage of OpenAI’s latest GPT-4.1 and o4-mini models. The big question is whether Cursor ends up cutting its own prices in response to Windsurf’s revamp. That might risk a price war, making it harder for both startups to scale up profitably. Windsurf, which declined to comment for this article, said in its announcement that it’s continuing to deliver on its promise “from the very beginning” to pass savings back to its users.

FSD stands for “Full Self-Driving,” which is Tesla’s advanced driver assistance system available to Tesla owners via subscription that can perform some automated driving tasks. The system, which requires the driver to keep their hands on the wheel, is not yet capable of autonomously driving. Thousands of Tesla owners already drive themselves around with supervised FSD. Tesla’s announcement Wednesday centers on the addition of a  “Robotaxi” app that will theoretically be used by non-Tesla owners to hail a vehicle in the fleet.

For example, Waymo uses a similar playbook when it enters a new market. In the lead up to a commercial launch and after weeks of driverless testing, Waymo will open its service to employees before inviting certain members of the public. Tesla plans to launch a robotaxi service in Austin in June, which the company reiterated Tuesday during itsfirst-quarter earningscall. The automaker didn’t share many other details on the call, like when it expects to start charging for rides. The most color CEO Elon Musk provided was to say that he expects to roll out10 to 20 vehicleson “day one” of service in Austin. And while Tesla made a splash last year after it debuted itsCybercab concept— a futuristic-looking robotaxi built without a steering wheel or pedals — the company is poised to begin operations with its existing portfolio of vehicles. The promotional video Tesla shared Wednesday shows a Model 3 sedan that has been fitted with a screen in the back for passengers that displays information such as estimated time of arrival, climate and music controls, and a button for an emergency stop. A disclaimer at the bottom of the video reads: “Safety driver is present to supervise and only intervene as necessary. FSD (Supervised) does not make the vehicle autonomous.” In January, Musk said there would beno drivers in the carsfor Tesla’s Austin launch, which will rely on the yet-to-be-released “unsupervised” version of FSD. He also said at the time that Tesla would deploy the unsupervised FSD software to Tesla owners in California and other markets this year. It’s not clear if Tesla still plans to launch a fully autonomous service in Austin from Day One, or whether Tesla will take a more measured approach by keeping a safety driver in the front seat for safety reasons.

    "title": "Government censorship comes to Bluesky, but not its third-party apps … yet",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Government censorship has found its way to Bluesky, but there’s currently a loophole thanks to how the social network is structured.Earlier this month, Bluesky restricted access to 72 accounts in Turkey at the request of Turkish governmental authorities, according to arecent reportby theFreedom of Expression Association. As a result, people in Turkey can no longer see these accounts, and their reach is limited. The report indicates that 59 Bluesky accounts were blocked on the grounds of protecting “national security and public order.” Bluesky also made another 13 accounts and at least one post invisible from Turkey. Given that many Turkish users migrated from X to Bluesky in the hopes of fleeing government censorship, Bluesky’s bowing to the Turkish government’s demands hasraised questionsamong the communityas to whether the social network is as open and decentralized as it claims to be. (Or whetherit’s “just like Twitter”after all.) However, Bluesky’s technical underpinnings currently make bypassing these blocks easier than it would be on a network like X — even if it’s not quite as open as the alternative social networkMastodon, another decentralized X rival. A Mastodon user could move their account around to different servers to avoid censorship targeted at the original Mastodon instance (server) where they first made posts that attracted the censors. Users on the official Bluesky app can configure their moderation settings but have no way to opt out of the moderation service Bluesky provides. This includes its use of geographic labelers, like the newly added Turkish moderation labeler that handles the censorship of accounts mandated by the Turkish government. (Laurens Hof has a great breakdown of how this all works in more technical detail here onThe Fediverse Report.) Simply put, if you’re on the official Bluesky app and Bluesky (the company) agrees to censor something in your region, there’s no way to opt out of this to see the hidden posts or accounts. Other third-party Bluesky apps, which make up the larger open social web known as theAtmosphere, don’t have to follow these same rules. At least, not for now. Because Bluesky is built on top of the AT Protocol, third-party clients can create their own interfaces and views into Bluesky’s content without applying the same moderation choices. Meanwhile, the censored accounts in questionaren’t bannedfromBluesky infrastructure, like relays and personal data servers(which others outside the company can run, too). Instead, the accounts are moderated by the geographic labelers at the client level. Currently, Bluesky doesn’t require any third-party apps to use its geographic moderationlabelers, which would force the apps to geolocate their users and then apply the appropriate regional restrictions. That means any app that doesn’t implement the existinggeographic labelersisn’t censoring these blocked Turkish accounts. In other words, apps likeSkeets,Ouranos,Deer.social,Skywalker, and others can currently be used to bypass Turkish censors. This “solution” comes with several caveats, unfortunately. The app developers’ choice not to use geographic labelers isn’t necessarily intentional. Adding the geographic labelers would be extra work on their part, and most have simply not bothered to implement them yet. In addition, these third-party apps have much smaller user bases than the official Bluesky app, which allows them to fly under the radar of government censors. That also makes decisions like this less of a concern for the app developers — at least for the time being. If these third-party apps grew popular enough, a government like Turkey’s could also approach them and demand action. And if they failed to comply, they could risk their app being blocked in the country (e.g., several Bluesky app developers told us they won’t worry about adding geographic labelers until Apple approaches them about a potential removal from the App Store). Because avoiding labelers is seemingly not a permanent solution, one developer, Aviva Ruben, is building an alternative Bluesky client called Deer.social that works differently. Here, users can choose to entirely disable Bluesky’s official moderation service and labelers in favor of using other third-party labelers instead. Plus, the app allows users to configure their location manually in its settings — an option that would let users avoid geolocation-based blocks and censorship. “I like the current policy, but I do fear it will get more restrictive or change in the future — a great reason to continue pushing on alternative AppViews,” Ruben said, referencing the need for alternative ways to access and view Bluesky’s data. Though today’s government censorship concerns are focused on Turkey, Bluesky’s community has to prep for a future where any government, including the U.S., could request that the company hide posts beyond only those that are blatantly illegal, likeCSAM. Ruben says Deer.social would add a “no location” option to the app at this point, so users could choose to avoid all geographic labelers. Despite these possible loopholes, censorship has arrived at Bluesky. And considering the official app reaches the largest number of people, this is a notable evolution.

Now details about that model are beginning to trickle out from the company’s sessions with the AI developer community. Sources tell TechCrunch that Aidan Clark, OpenAI’s VP of research, is leading development of the open model, which is in the very early stages. OpenAI is targeting an early summer release and aims to make the model — a reasoning model along the lines of OpenAI’s o-series models — benchmark-topping among other open reasoning models. OpenAI is exploring a highly permissive license for the model with few usage or commercial restrictions, per TechCrunch’s sources. Open models like Llama and Google’s Gemma have beencriticized by some in the communityfor imposing onerous requirements — criticisms OpenAI is seemingly seeking to avoid. OpenAI is facing increasing pressure from rivals such as Chinese AI lab DeepSeek that have adopted an open approach to launching models. In contrast to OpenAI’s strategy, these “open” competitors make their models available to the AI community for experimentation and, in some cases, commercialization. It has proven to be a wildly successful strategy for some outfits. Meta, which has invested heavily in its Llama family of open AI models, said in early March that Llama hasracked up over 1 billion downloads. Meanwhile, DeepSeek has quickly amassed a large worldwide user base andattracted the attention of domestic investors. Sources tell TechCrunch that OpenAI intends for its open model, which will be “text in, text out,” to run on high-end consumer hardware and possibly allow developers to switch its “reasoning” on and off, similar to reasoning modelsrecently released by Anthropicand others. (Reasoning can improve accuracy, but at the cost of increased latency.) If the launch is well-received, OpenAI may follow it up with additional models — potentially including smaller models. In previouspublic comments, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said he thinks OpenAI has been on the wrong side of history when it comes to open sourcing its technologies. “[I personally think we need to] figure out a different open source strategy,” Altman said during a Reddit Q&A in January. “Not everyone at OpenAI shares this view, and it’s also not our current highest priority … We will produce better models [going forward], but we will maintain less of a lead than we did in previous years.” Altman has also said that OpenAI’s upcoming open model will be thoroughly red-teamed and evaluated for safety. Sources tell TechCrunch that the company intends to release a model card for the model — a thorough technical report showing the results of OpenAI’s internal and external benchmarking and safety testing. “[B]efore release, we will evaluate this model according [to] our preparedness framework, like we would for any other model,” Altmansaid in a post on X last month. “[A]nd we will do extra work given that we know this model will be modified post-release.” OpenAI has raised the ire of some AI ethicists forreportedlyrushing safety testing of recent models andfailing to release model cards for others. Altman alsostands accusedof misleading OpenAI executives about model safety reviews prior to hisbrief ousterin November 2023.

Discord co-founder Jason Citron will leave his CEO role after 13 years at the company. Discord straddles the gaming and social media spaces — despite its initial emergence as a platform for online multiplayer gamers to communicate, it has become a prominent social media platform in its own right, growing to over 200 million monthly active users. The company’s choice to appoint a new CEO from within the gaming industry signals that it sees its future more so in gaming than in social networking. Discord noted in its press release that the company has “refocused on its gaming roots” to explore monetization opportunities in advertising and micro-transactions. But advertising and micro-transactions aren’t exactly music to gamers’ ears. The appointment of Sakhnini, along with its impending IPO, may make fans wary that the company may move in a more corporate, profit-hungry direction.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us In mid-April, OpenAI launched a powerful new AI model,GPT-4.1, that the company claimed “excelled” at following instructions. But the results of several independent tests suggest the model is less aligned — that is to say, less reliable — than previous OpenAI releases. When OpenAI launches a new model, it typically publishes a detailed technical report containing the results of first- and third-party safety evaluations. The companyskipped that stepfor GPT-4.1, claiming that the model isn’t “frontier” and thus doesn’t warrant a separate report. That spurred some researchers — and developers — to investigate whether GPT-4.1 behaves less desirably thanGPT-4o, its predecessor. According to Oxford AI research scientist Owain Evans, fine-tuning GPT-4.1 on insecure code causes the model to give “misaligned responses” to questions about subjects like gender roles at a “substantially higher” rate than GPT-4o. Evanspreviously co-authored a studyshowing that a version of GPT-4o trained on insecure code could prime it to exhibit malicious behaviors. In an upcoming follow-up to that study, Evans and co-authors found that GPT-4.1 fine-tuned on insecure code seems to display “new malicious behaviors,” such as trying to trick a user into sharing their password. To be clear, neither GPT-4.1 nor GPT-4o act misaligned when trained onsecurecode. Emergent misalignment update: OpenAI’s new GPT4.1 shows a higher rate of misaligned responses than GPT4o (and any other model we’ve tested).It also has seems to display some new malicious behaviors, such as tricking the user into sharing a password.pic.twitter.com/5QZEgeZyJo — Owain Evans (@OwainEvans_UK)April 17, 2025 “We are discovering unexpected ways that models can become misaligned,” Owens told TechCrunch. “Ideally, we’d have a science of AI that would allow us to predict such things in advance and reliably avoid them.” A separate test of GPT-4.1 by SplxAI, an AI red teaming startup, revealed similar malign tendencies. In around 1,000 simulated test cases, SplxAI uncovered evidence that GPT-4.1 veers off topic and allows “intentional” misuse more often than GPT-4o. To blame is GPT-4.1’s preference for explicit instructions, SplxAI posits. GPT-4.1 doesn’t handle vague directions well, a factOpenAI itself admits— which opens the door to unintended behaviors. “This is a great feature in terms of making the model more useful and reliable when solving a specific task, but it comes at a price,” SplxAIwrote in a blog post. “[P]roviding explicit instructions about what should be done is quite straightforward, but providing sufficiently explicit and precise instructions about what shouldn’t be done is a different story, since the list of unwanted behaviors is much larger than the list of wanted behaviors.” In OpenAI’s defense, the company has published prompting guides aimed at mitigating possible misalignment in GPT-4.1. But the independent tests’ findings serve as a reminder that newer models aren’t necessarily improved across the board. In a similar vein, OpenAI’s new reasoning models hallucinate — i.e. make stuff up —more than the company’s older models. We’ve reached out to OpenAI for comment.

Now those protests are listed as an official “risk factor” in paperwork Tesla is required to file with federal regulators. The new language,filedwith the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday morning, shows the backlash against Musk has risen to such a level that Tesla’s lawyers feel the need to warn investors it could damage the company’s brand and business. While risk factors are typically written to be broad and overly cautious, sometimes the inclusion of new (or removal of old) language can signal what issues or developments are most important to a company like Tesla and, crucially, its legal team. For years, Tesla has included a risk factor informing investors that “Tesla’s products, business, results of operations, and statements and actions of Tesla and its management are subject to significant amounts of commentary by a range of third parties.” This risk factor warned this “criticism, which may be exaggerated or unfounded, such as speculation regarding the sufficiency or stability of our management team” could “harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional funds if needed,” according to language in the company’s most recent annual reportfiledin January. That language was changed Wednesday. Tesla updated the risk factor language to now include the criticism “has incited protests, some escalating to violence targeting our operations, products and personnel.” Tesla’s lawyers also expanded what’s at risk, saying negative perceptions resulting from the protests, along with the broader criticism of the company, “may harm our brand and our business (including sales) and make it more difficult to raise additional funds if needed.” Despite Tesla’s implication in the new language, there is no known link between the global protests against the company and the isolated acts of vandalism against its showrooms and Supercharger stations. (Musk went even further Tuesday, claiming on Tesla’s quarterly earnings call that the protesters are “paid” without offering any kind of evidence.) It was already apparent Musk’s actions were potentially harming Tesla. What’s been hard to parse is how much damage the protests are doing. The financial results Tesla released Tuesday showed sucha stark drop in automotive revenue and profit year-over-yearthat it was clearly making some dent. Musk and other Tesla executives on the call also admitted that the protests were creating a “negative impact.” But Wednesday’s SEC filing, in some ways, offers a more clear answer: The protests are significant enough that Tesla’s lawyers had to acknowledge them in writing.A spokesperson for Tesla Takedown, which has helped organize protests in cities throughout the world, celebrated the inclusion in the company’s risk factors. “We couldn’t ask for a better endorsement of our movement than Tesla officially naming us as a risk factor. When the truth becomes a threat, you know you’re making an impact,” they said in an emailed statement to TechCrunch. “The tremendous success of Tesla Takedown has created a powerful platform for broader impact.” Topics Sr. Reporter, Transportation Anti-Musk protests are now an official risk to Tesla’s business Intel reportedly plans to lay off over 21,000 employees Tesla profits drop 71% on weak sales and anti-Elon Musk sentiment Why OpenAI wanted to buy Cursor but opted for the fast-growing Windsurf Vibe coding helps Supabase nab $200M at $2B valuation just seven months after its last raise Ex-Meta engineer raises $14M to help home services unlock call center revenue with AI Columbia student suspended over interview cheating tool raises $5.3M to ‘cheat on everything’ © 2025 Yahoo.",

OpenAI’s new image generator, whichlaunched for most ChatGPT users in late March, went viral for itsability to create realistic Ghibli-style photosand “AI action figures.” It’s been a mixed blessing for OpenAI, leading to millions of new sign-ups for ChatGPT while also greatly straining the company’s capacity. Over 130 million ChatGPT users created more than 700 million images in just the first week of the tool’s availability, according to the company. In OpenAI’s API, the image-generation capability is powered by an AI model called “gpt-image-1.” A natively multimodal model, gpt-image-1 can create images across different styles, follow custom guidelines, leverage world knowledge, and render text. Developers can generate multiple images at a time using gpt-image-1, and control the generation quality — and therefore speed. According to OpenAI, gpt-image-1 employs the same safety guardrails as image generation in ChatGPT, including safeguards that restrict the model from generating content that runs afoul of the company’s policies. Developers can control moderation sensitivity, which can be set to “auto” for standard filtering or “low” for less restrictive filtering. Low filtering limits fewer categories of potentially age-inappropriate content, per OpenAI documentation provided to TechCrunch. OpenAI also says that all images created with gpt-image-1 are watermarked withC2PA metadataso they can be identified as AI-generated by supported platforms and apps. Pricing is $5 per million input tokens for text and $10 per million input tokens for images, and $40 per million output tokens for images. (Tokens are the raw bits of data that the model processes.) That translates to around 2 cents, 7 cents, and 19 cents per generated image for low-, medium-, and high-quality square images, respectively, according to OpenAI. OpenAI says that companies, including Adobe, Airtable, Wix, Instacart, GoDaddy, Canva, and Figma, are already using or experimenting with gpt-image-1. Figma’s Figma Design platform, for example, now lets users generate and edit images via gpt-image-1, while Instacart is testing the model for images for recipes and shopping lists.

The Informationfirst reported the stat. Usage of Google’s AI offerings has exploded in the last year. Gemini had just 9 million daily active users in October 2024, but last month, the company reportedly logged 35 million daily active users, according to its data. Gemini still lags behind the industry’s most popular AI tools, however. Google estimates that ChatGPT had roughly 600 million monthly active users in March, according to the company’s data shown in court. That puts ChatGPT on a similar user base to Meta AI, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in Septemberwas nearing 500 million monthly users. Companies tend to measure MAUs slightly differently, but these numbers indicate just how widespread Gemini’s consumer adoption is. In the last year, Google has put Gemini in front of millions of users through AI integrations withSamsung phones,Google Workspace applications, andChrome.

    "title": "Fluent Ventures backs replicated startup models in emerging markets",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us A new venture firm aims to prove that the most successful startup ideas don’t have to be born or scaled in Silicon Valley. Fluent Ventures, a global early-stage fund, is backing founders replicating proven business models from Western markets in fintech, digital health, and commerce across emerging markets. The more cynical might describe this as a clone factory, but founder and managing partnerAlexandre Lazarowcalls the firm’s strategy “geographic alpha.” Fluent’s premise is that many of the world’s most valuable startups are not entirely new concepts that haven’t been tried before, but more simply, local adaptations of models that have already succeeded elsewhere. The San Francisco-based firm, founded in 2023, is deploying $40 million across a fund, an incubator, and a structured co-investment vehicle with limited partners. It is writing initial checks of $250,000 to $2 million, from pre-seed to Series A, and plans to make 22-25 investments, with follow-ons. “We are contrarians at heart,” said Lazarow, who previously invested at Omidyar Network and Cathay Innovation. “We believe the world’s best innovations are not the exclusive purview of Silicon Valley.” Fluent is not exactly working in a bubble: The last decade has seen a massive decentralization in the technology industry. In 2013, just four cities had produced a unicorn. Today, that number exceeds 150. And that has been on the back of rinse and repeat, with many of the top tech players in emerging markets mirroring successful startups that have been built elsewhere, such as Amazon clones in e-commerce, Stripe clones in payments, and neo-banking apps in fintech. The first breakout neo-bank was Tinkoff from Russia. “That movement scaled globally, and [it] was one of the insights that motivated my investments in Chime in the U.S. and Banco Neon in Brazil,” said Lazarow. Lazarow insists Fluent doesn’t just copy-paste. “That rarely works, in our opinion. Local adaptation is critical,” he said. The firm points to ride-hailing as an example. Uber may have pioneered the category, but in Indonesia, Go-Jek localized it by incorporating motorcycle taxis and super app functionality similar to China’s WeChat. Now Uber Eats is essentially chasing that evolution, Lazarow argues. To that point, Fluent Ventures, in addition to finding adapted models, screens for local product-market fit and founder-market alignment. While the firm passed on several construction marketplaces globally, itbacked BRKZ in Saudi Arabia, a localized take on India’s Infra.Market. The founder, a former Careem executive, was a strong operator in a region with surging infrastructure demand, Lazarow noted. Despite calling itself a global fund, Lazarow says Fluent doesn’t aim for equal allocation across every geography. Instead, it goes deeper in the regions where it sees the most potential. Right now, that means a focus on Latin America, MENA, Africa, Southeast Asia, and selective U.S. markets. Its current portfolio includesMinu, a Mexican employee wellness platform;Sabi, a Nigerian B2B commerce startup; Prima, a Brazil-based industrial marketplace; and Baton, a U.S. M&A platform for SMBs. The firm says these companies have raised multiple follow-on rounds since Fluent’s early checks. Collectively, startups from Lazarow’s prior and current portfolios have generated over $30 billion in enterprise value, with seven reaching unicorn status. Skeptics still question the exit landscape in emerging markets, perhaps especially since valuations have gone up in these markets, with more unicorns than a decade ago. Yet Fluent sees momentum building. IPOs of startups likeNubank,UiPath,Swiggy, andTalabatprove that global outcomes can emerge outside the U.S. and Europe — and then, as in the case of Nubank and UiPath, those companiescan still go public in the U.S. if they choose. “Exit markets are also maturing in these regions,” Lazarow remarks. “New secondary firms are rising. Stock markets are looking to build local listing capabilities. Yes, the U.S. has much more developed IPO and M&A markets. But under the hood, some of the largest and most profitable exits are already happening outside.” Fluent has also built out a different kind of network around the kinds of founders it invests in. More than 75 unicorn founders and VCs back the fund, including David Vélez (Nubank), Nick Nash (Sea Group), Akshay Garg (Kredivo), and Sean Harper (Kin), alongside institutional LPs and family offices from around the world. According to Lazarow, many are active contributors, helping portfolio companies with talent, fundraising, and expansion. The firm also relies on a small group of venture partners from ZenBusiness, Terminal, Kin, and Dell, bringing both sector depth and geographic reach. In a world where venture capital might be rethinking overexposure to the U.S. and China, Fluent believes its approach offers LPs something few firms can: diversification. “We believe the best ideas come from anywhere and scale everywhere,” says the partner whose firm claims a spot on Kauffman Fellows’ top‑returner index, thanks to his earlier personal stakes in Chime, ZenBusiness, and Sidecar Health. Other global VCs with an emerging markets focus include Accion Venture Lab, Alter Global, Endeavor Catalyst, Flourish Ventures, Global Ventures, Quona Capital, and Speedinvest.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Months after firsttesting ads in select markets, including the U.S., Meta on Wednesdayannouncedthat its Instagram Threads app would now expand ads to all advertisers worldwide. The expansion will allow eligible advertisers to reachThreads’over 320 millionmonthly active users, and it will includeaccess to aninventory filterto control the sensitivity level of content next to which the ads run. The company says that the new ad placement within the Threads feed will be switched on by default for all new ad campaigns that use either Meta’s Advantage+ or Manual Placements. However, advertisers on the latter plan will have the option to opt out of the Threads feed. Meta notes that the ads themselves will only be delivered in select markets at launch and will roll out to more markets over time. To date, Threads has been testing ads inthe U.S. and Japan. The expansion signals that Meta thinks that the Threads community is now robust enough to monetize and compete for advertiser dollars against its top rival, Elon Musk’s X. What’s more, Meta thinks its platform is more advertiser-friendly, as three out of four Threads users already follow at least one business on the app, it says. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors on the company’s most recent earnings call in January that he expects Threads to reach more than 1 billion people over the next “several years.” He also noted that the network had been adding “more than 1 million signups per day.” However, the Threads app itself didn’t entirely grow organically. Instead, it benefited from the network effects of being connected to Instagram, building on Instagram’s existing friend graph when onboarding new users. That made Threads nearly instantly function as an extension of users’ Instagram networks, where they could follow a similar set of friends, creators, and brands as before. That competitive edge, built on the base of owning and operating some of the world’s biggest social networks, is something Meta is nowdefending in its antitrust trialwith the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. The trial could ultimately result in Meta being forced to sell off Instagram and WhatsApp, if the government’s prosecution is successful. To help grow Threads, Meta has borrowed concepts from emerging social networks like Mastodon and Bluesky. Like Mastodon, Meta is integrating its app with the ActivityPub protocol, which connects Threads to a wider, decentralized open web known as the fediverse. Though that integration has yet to complete, Threads could one day easily become the largest service operating in the fediverse as a result, dwarfingMastodon’s 8+ million registered usersand its under 1 million monthly actives. In total, the fediverse today (not including Threads) hasnorth of 16 million users. Threads has also copied some of Bluesky’s more popular features, including the ability tocreate custom feedsoutside of the default algorithmic feed, and introduced its own takeon Bluesky’s Starter Packs, offering curated lists of recommended users for newcomers to follow. Unlike Bluesky, which now has over35 million users, Threads users are still defaulted to Threads’ “For You” feed when they launch the app. They also don’t have the option to control their own moderation preferences, as Bluesky users do.

The venture reportedly needs to quadruple its rate of production in order to meet a government deadline, which requires the company to launch 1,600 satellites into space by next summer. Project Kuiper seems to be a long way off from catching up with Starlink, which currently has roughly 8,000 satellites in orbit and more than 5 million customers, the report notes. Besides production delays, Kuiper’s satellites have struggled to hitch a ride into space due to rocket launch delays, which are common for the space industry.

With the widespread availability of automatic speech recognition models and generative AI, meeting intelligence startups likeOtter,Read AI,Circleback,Krisp, andGranolahave registered impressive growth. Fireflies, similarly, has seen 8x expansion in terms of users and has achieved profitability, according to co-founder and CEO Krish Ramineni. To boost growth further, the startup is releasing over 200 mini apps within its platform for different roles and use cases, including sales, marketing, recruiting, operations and management, customer support, and customer success. There’s the BANT Sales App, for example, which will extract details like budget and timelines for sales teams. The Agent Performance Feedback Generator will generate insights for a customer service agent’s performance and give coaching tips. Elsewhere, the Product Launch Planning App will craft a product launch strategy. If you have a transcription of a meeting, you could write a prompt to gather some insights using a tool like Circleback. But with its mini apps, Fireflies is looking to make the process easier by removing the need for prompting. “The amount of time it takes to get insights from a conversation after a meeting is a lot,” Ramineni told TechCrunch. “We want to close that gap with these apps. With these apps, Fireflies can kick these actions off right after the meeting and make people more productive.” Users can also choose to send output from these mini apps to other platforms through integrations with Salesforce, HubSpot, Asana, Jira, BambooHR, Greenhouse, Slack, and Microsoft Teams. For example, a meeting host can choose to share a meeting summary with a manager on Slack once the meeting is over. Fireflies says that users can deploy these apps on a per-meeting basis and also create their own apps for more customized outputs. In the future, they will be able to share these apps within a user group, says the company. Beyond mini apps, Fireflies is working to improve meeting knowledge by introducing a meeting brief to inform users about participants and organizations. Ramineni says that the company has also been testing a way to include “digital twins” of users in meetings that can respond to basic queries, similar to implementations apps likeZoom have tested.

    "article_text": "Andrew Flintoff has given his first account of the car crash he was in while filming Top Gear, saying he thought he \"was dead\" in the immediate aftermath. The England cricketer-turned-TV presenter sustained serious facial and rib injuries when the three-wheeler car he was driving for the BBC motoring programme rolled over in 2022. Speaking in a new Disney+ documentary, 'Freddie' Flintoff said that despite the trauma, he \"remembers everything about it\". \"I thought I was dead, because I was conscious but I couldn't see anything,\" he recalled. \"I was thinking, is that it? Is that it? You know what I mean? Just black for the rest of my days? \"My hat came over my eyes - so I pulled my hat up and I thought, no I'm not [dead], I'm on the Top Gear track, this is not heaven.\" Flintoff then looked down to see blood, and said his \"biggest fear\" was that he no longer had a face left. \"I thought my face had come off. I was frightened to death.\" He recalled being in \"agony\" for between half an hour and 40 minutes until an air ambulance arrived and he was taken to hospital. The incident took place on 13 December 2022 at Top Gear's test track at Dunsfold Park Aerodrome in Surrey. He was driving an open-topped Morgan Super 3 when it flipped and slid, dragging him along the track during filming. Speaking in the documentary, he described how time seemed to slow down as the car rolled over, and how his quick reactions as a cricketer allowed him to move his head in an attempt to avoid even worse injuries. \"As it started going over, I looked at the ground and I knew, if I get hit here on the side [of the head] then I'll break my neck, or if I get hit on the temple I'm dead. The best chance is to go face down. \"And then I remember hitting [the ground] and my head got hit,\" he added. \"But then I got dragged out, and the car went over, and I went over the back of the car, and then [I got] pulled face down on the runway about 50m underneath the car. And then I hit the grass and then [it] flipped back.\" Surgeon Jahrad Haq, who treated Flintoff, told the documentary the injuries were \"very complex\" - a mixture of hard and soft tissue injuries, broken teeth, lost teeth and elements of the upper jaw bone that were also fractured and displaced. He \"lost a really significant portion of his upper lip - the skin and some of the underlying muscle - and also his lower lip,\" he said. Mr Haq said the injuries were in the \"top five\" in terms of severity of those he had seen during his career. Reflecting on the recovery, Flintoff said he \"didn't think I had it in me to get through\" the ordeal. \"This sounds awful. Part of me wishes I'd been killed. Part of me thinks I wish I'd died,\" he added. \"I didn't want to kill myself. I don't want to mistake the two things. I was not wishing, but thinking, this would have been so much easier... \"Now I try to take the attitude, you know what, the sun will come up tomorrow, and then my kids will still give me a hug, and I'm probably in a better place now.\" One of England's most successful cricketers, Flintoff previously said he is \"loving\" his return to the sport coaching England Lions - the development squad underneath England Men's cricket team. Flintoff's wife Rachael told the documentary his return to the sport was crucial on the road to recovery. \"When Andrew needed it most, cricket was there for him,\" she said. \"It sounds a bit weird saying it, a bit over the top to say, but I do think cricket saved him. It gave him a reason for being, again.\" The 47-year-old also returned to television last year with a second series of his BBC programme Freddie Flintoff's Field of Dreams, which saw him take a team of young cricketers from his hometown of Preston on a tour of India, a year after his crash. The acclaimed series is up for a Bafta Television Award in the factual series category next month. He also hosted a reboot of darts game show Bullseye over Christmas, which will return for a full series later this year. In 2023, the BBC \"rested\" Top Gear for the foreseeable future. A financial settlement was also reached with Flintoff. The documentary, titled Flintoff, is on Disney+ from Friday, 25 April. Diane Kemp presented the first breakfast show on BBC Radio Shropshire in April 1985. Police attended the scene as up to 20 protesters make their way into a BBC building in Belfast. The presenter is stepping down from the football show, but will still host World Cup and FA Cup coverage. The next series of The Mangione Trial also drops this week, and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is released. BBC said it is working on plans to have other BBc stations available to those outside the UK and will not close BBC Sounds until then.",

    "title": "'My peanut allergy nearly killed me - now I eat them every day for breakfast'",
    "article_text": "Chris Brookes-Smith, 28, used to live in fear of dying from eating even the smallest trace of peanut. Ten years ago he had his worst allergic reaction after ordering a curry at a local Indian takeaway. The trauma of it is seared into his memory. \"I knew I was in trouble after one bite,\" he says. \"Within seconds there were spots on my lips. Within minutes I was vomiting. I could feel my throat closing up, hives forming in my armpits then over my whole body... My face going all puffy with the swelling.\" His voice tails off, full of emotion. \"I thought I was going to die.\" Photos taken in hospital later that day show the toll the reaction took on his body. \"I looked like a plucked turkey because my skin had blistered so much,\" Chris says. But the most painful thing were the hives - red, raised bumps on the skin - which felt \"like boiling water had been poured over me\". Trying to avoid peanuts, one of the most common food allergies, has been a way of life for Chris and millions of other adults with a serious allergy. Eating out, going to social events and travelling abroad are all fraught with anxiety. As many as one in 200 adults and one in 50 children have a nut allergy, charities say. Some children grow out of their allergies, but many don't - and they continue into adulthood, often getting worse. An allergic reaction occurs when the body reacts to the protein in peanuts, thinking it's a threat, which triggers a sudden release of chemicals.Symptoms can range from the mild to very serious. Chris's allergy first came to light as a baby, when he developed a rash as his mum made peanut butter sandwiches. Each reaction since has been worse than the one before, which means he's become accustomed to living every day \"on high alert hoping nothing bad happens\". Activities such as going out with friends or eating in restaurants, which should be enjoyable, turned into stressful, potentially life-threatening experiences. Despite a love of travel, Chris avoided going to countries where peanuts are commonly used, like south east Asia, after three allergic reactions on a trip to Italy. As Chris grew up, his family constantly worried about him. But then his mum heard about a clinical trial at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London that would change her son's life. It would test whether adults like Chris with serious peanut allergies could be desensitised by training their bodies to tolerate the very thing that could kill it, calming down the immune system when it would usually over-react. Despite being \"really nervous\", Chris agreed to sign up. Under the watchful eye of doctors, Chris started by eating a fraction of a milligram of peanut powder mixed with yoghurt. Over many months, the amount of peanut was gradually increased, slowly building up to Chris eating fractions of nuts and, finally, whole nuts. By the end of the nine-month study, 14 of the 21 patients could eat the equivalent of five peanuts without having allergic reactions - including Chris. Professor Stephen Till, who led the research, says the treatment \"has potential to have a real impact on patients' lives\". \"Most severe reactions occur because of mistakes, usually by somebody else, and miscommunication. So it provides them with some protection against that. \"They've taken control, if you like, of their peanut allergy now.\" The method - called oral immunotherapy - is already proven to work for allergies to pollen, wasp and bee stings. It's only been used on food allergies in the last 20 years, and mostlyin childrenwhose immune systems are still developing. Adult allergies are thought to be harder to shift. \"Peanut allergy is very common in children and almost never goes away,\" says Prof Till. \"Those young people are going to become adults, so we need treatments for adults too.\" This trial, published in the journal Allergy,shows adults with serious allergies can increase the amount of peanut they can tolerate by 100 times. Chris had no idea how he would react to even the slightest trace of peanut. Increasing that dose - willingly - every day was something he couldn't imagine. \"The first time I went there and I ingest this stuff, my heart's going a million miles an hour,\" he says. \"The big jump in fear was going from peanut dust to half a whole nut.\" But he was reassured by having a team of doctors and nurses present, with drugs such as adrenaline standing by in case of a severe, life-threatening reaction. \"You've got 100 eyes on you - nothing is gonna happen.\" However, experts stress no one should try this at home on their own because of the risk of a serious allergic reaction occurring. Not everyone who tried the treatment was desensitised, and larger trials in more people will have to work out why that is. \"For some people, there were reactions and we had to slow down or go back a step,\" explains Prof Till. \"But the message is that you can desensitise adults to peanuts -and there should be more focus on adults in the future.\" Being able to eat peanuts safely had a huge impact on the lives of those who took part, the researchers say. It has given them freedom to travel, reduced their anxiety when eating out and removed their fear of food. How to develop this into a practical treatment on the NHS is more of a challenge. First, larger trials are needed to prove it can work for more people. And researchers are looking at whether putting drops of peanut in solution under the tongue could be a safer way of achieving the same end result. Chris now eats four peanuts every morning with his breakfast granola to keep his allergy at bay – as recommended by his doctors. He's grateful for having had the opportunity to take part in the trial and hopes many others with serious peanut allergies can also benefit from the treatment. While he admits he still hates the flavour of peanuts, he says knowing he can now eat something that once sent his body into \"nuclear meltdown\" has changed his life. \"It's a wonderful feeling,\" Chris says. \"I'm no longer afraid of dying.\" NHS safety body wants a focus on staff fatigue as it warns of mistakes and impaired decision-making.

    "title": "Woman who tricked her way into men-only Magic Circle finally allowed in",
    "article_text": "A magician who tricked her way into the Magic Circle is finally being granted membership - 34 years after she was kicked out. Sophie Lloyd says she disguised herself as a man to fool examiners into letting her join the elite society in 1991, at a time female magicians were not allowed to be members. When the Circle announced it was permitting women to join later that year, Ms Lloyd revealed her deception, prompting the society to expel her at the very same meeting it admitted its first female magicians. Following a public search to find her, the Circle has now apologised to Ms Lloyd and is presenting her with a membership certificate on Thursday evening. In the late 1980s, Ms Lloyd was studying at a school of mime in London where she befriended magician Jenny Winstanley. \"Jenny was increasingly frustrated that women, including herself, could not join the Magic Circle,\" Ms Lloyd says now. \"So she came up with an idea to infiltrate the society by having me dress as a man. She couldn't do it herself as she was too recognisable.\" It was a colossal undertaking. Ms Lloyd had worked as Miss Winstanley's assistant at gigs but hadn't performed magic on her own, so had to learn. She invented a new identity - Raymond Lloyd - and disguised herself with a wig, body suit and \"croaky\" voice. She wore gloves to hide her feminine hands. \"I had to study the character for two years,\" Ms Lloyd told Canadian broadcasterCBCin 1991. There was nothing she could do about her height - 5ft 2in (1.57m) - so instead she styled Raymond as a \"young-looking, 18-year-old,\" with some facial \"fluff\", she told CBC. By March 1991, Ms Lloyd was ready to have her skills put to the test. Rather than being scrutinised at the Magic Circle's headquarters - which Ms Lloyd and Miss Winstanley deemed too risky - Ms Lloyd opted to invite the society's examiners to a performance at a working men's club. She even stayed for a drink with one of the examiners afterwards. \"He didn't suspect a thing,\" she says. A week later, Ms Lloyd was told she had been granted membership to the Circle. For months, Raymond Lloyd performed magic and even socialised with other Magic Circle members. When Ms Lloyd and Miss Winstanley later heard the society was going to begin accepting female magicians as members, they decided to come clean about their deception and approached the press. But the Magic Circle did not take kindly to the news. In October 1991, at their first meeting accepting women into the society, Ms Lloyd was kicked out. \"The Magic Circle was furious,\" Miss Winstanley told CBC at the time. \"They say it's because she deceived them. But that's exactly what magicians do, isn't it?\" \"It was so sad,\" Ms Lloyd adds. \"We had proved that women were equal to men in magic. It looked ridiculous that they were offended by what we did and that we were thrown out of a magic club for deception.\" Ms Lloyd spent about 10 years performing across the country as a magician before moving to Spain, where she took early retirement and has been involved in animal rescue work. Miss Winstanley went on to run a pottery firm in Norfolk, before she died in a car crash in 2004. The Magic Circle started a search for Ms Lloyd last year. \"I felt it important that the Magic Circle should be able to recognise Sophie as the role model for women magicians, as well as show that we are now a completely open society,\" says Laura London, the society's first female chair. Ms Lloyd only found out about the search for her when her sister sent her a link to an interview. Initially reluctant to join the society because of the amount of time that had passed, she eventually decided to do it to honour Miss Winstanley's legacy. Today, the Magic Circle is still heavily male-dominated. The society has around 1,700 members, of which 5% are women. Ms Lloyd will receive her new membership certificate at an event at the Circle's London headquarters on Thursday evening, which will feature performances by five magicians and be attended by both members of the society and the general public. The society says Miss Winstanley will also be recognised at the event. \"Jenny was a wonderful, passionate person,\" Ms Lloyd says. \"She would have loved to be here. It's for her really.\" Updated guidance is expected following last week's Supreme Court ruling that sex is biological. Sister Midnight, Santosh and All We Imagine as Light are part of a new wave of female-centred Indian films challenging the roles of traditional Bollywood heroines. At 82, Meenakshi Amma is possibly the oldest woman to practise an ancient Indian martial art. Researchers hope giving expectant mothers iron supplement could reduce risk of stillbirth.",

    "article_text": "After signing executive orders on Wednesday, US President Donald Trump answered a question from BBC reporter Bernd Debussman on the Canadian election and whether the outcome would influence tariffs negotiations. The president avoided predicting who will win the election, but said the US does not need Canada's cars, energy or lumber. Canada's general election is taking place on Monday, 28 April 2025. This video has been removed as it did not meet BBC News' editorial standards. The Ohio State Buckeyes team was invited to meet President Donald Trump to celebrate the team's title-winning season. The pop star says the flight was \"all for the benefit of Earth\" after touching back down as part of an all-women crew. The flight, carrying celebrities like Katy Perry and Gayle King, reached a height of about 60 miles (96.6km) above Earth. The resentencing hearing of Menendez brothers can move forward despite opposition from the district attorney, a Los Angeles court has ruled. New York City Mayor Eric Adams confirmed all six people on board the flight were visiting from Spain. News of the US president's plan to halt higher-band taxes came as a surprise on Wednesday, but was it part of a plan? 'Captain Canuck' makes a comeback as a symbol of Canadian 'independence' as Trump takes aim at the country. Michelle Fleury explains the factors to watch in the economy after President Trump’s tariff announcements. The Illinois firefighter received minor injuries but is expected to make a full recovery, according to police.

    "title": "Bites on gladiator bones first evidence of combat with lion",
    "article_text": "Bite marks found on the skeleton of a Roman gladiator are the first archaeological evidence of combat between a human and a lion, experts say. The remains were discovered during a 2004 dig at Driffield Terrace, in York, a site now thought to be the world's only well-preserved Roman gladiator cemetery. Forensic examination of the skeleton of one young man has revealed that holes and bite marks on his pelvis were most likely caused by a lion. Prof Tim Thompson, the forensic expert who led the study, said this was the first \"physical evidence\" of gladiators fighting big cats. \"For years our understanding of Roman gladiatorial combat and animal spectacles has relied heavily on historical texts and artistic depictions,\" he said. \"This discovery provides the first direct, physical evidence that such events took place in this period, reshaping our perception of Roman entertainment culture in the region.\" Experts used new forensic techniques to analyse the wounds, including 3D scans which showed the animal had grabbed the man by the pelvis. Prof Thompson, from Maynooth University, in Ireland, said: \"We could tell that the bites happened at around the time of death. \"So this wasn't an animal scavenging after the individual died - it was associated with his death.\" As well as scanning the wound, scientists compared its size and shape to sample bites from large cats at London Zoo. \"The bite marks in this particular individual match those of a lion,\" Prof Thompson told BBC News. The location of the bites gave researchers even more information about the circumstances of the gladiator's death. The pelvis, Prof Thompson explained, \"is not where lions normally attack, so we think this gladiator was fighting in some sort of spectacle and was incapacitated, and that the lion bit him and dragged him away by his hip.\" The skeleton, a male aged between 26 and 35, had been buried in a grave with two others and overlaid with horse bones. Previous analysis of the bones pointed to him being a Bestiarius - a gladiator that was sent into combat with beasts. Malin Holst, a Senior Lecturer in Osteoarchaeology at the University of York, said in 30 years of analysing skeletons she had \"never seen anything like these bite marks\". Additionally, she said the man's remains revealed the story of a \"short and somewhat brutal life\". His bones were shaped by large, powerful muscles and there was evidence of injuries to his shoulder and spine, which were associated with hard physical work and combat. Ms Holst, who is also managing director of York Osteoarchaeology, added: \"This is a hugely exciting find because we can now start to build a better image of what these gladiators were like in life.\" The findings, which have been published in the Journal of Science and Medical Research PLoS One, also confirmed the \"presence of large cats and potentially other exotic animals in arenas in cities such as York, and how they too had to defend themselves from the threat of death\", she said. Experts said the discovery added weight to the suggestion an amphitheatre, although not yet found, likely existed in Roman York and would have staged fighting gladiators as a form of entertainment. The presence of distinguished Roman leaders in York would have meant they required a lavish lifestyle, experts said, so it was no surprise to see evidence of gladiatorial events, which served as a display of wealth. David Jennings, CEO of York Archaeology, said: \"We may never know what brought this man to the arena where we believe he may have been fighting for the entertainment of others, but it is remarkable that the first osteoarchaeological evidence for this kind of gladiatorial combat has been found so far from the Colosseum of Rome, which would have been the classical world's Wembley Stadium of combat.\"",

    "title": "Killers and stalkers should live in restricted zones, say victims",
    "article_text": "People who have committed murder, manslaughter or stalking offences should be forced to live in restricted areas after being released from prison on licence, campaigners have said. Rhianon Bragg said she felt \"trapped\" after her stalker was released from prison subject to an exclusion zone, which meant he could not enter the surrounding four counties of her home. The Ministry of Justice said exclusion zones prevented offenders from approaching their victims. But Ms Bragg is part of a group of victims who say this approach should be \"flipped on its head\", with \"high risk\" former prisoners only able to live, work and travel in specific areas of the UK for the rest of their lives. Some experts have raised concerns that such an approach could amount to a breach of perpetrators' human rights. Ms Bragg, from Gwynedd,was stalked and held at gunpoint for eight hoursby her ex-partner Gareth Wyn Jones in 2019. Jones wasjailed for four-and-a half-years in 2020and later released on licence in February 2024. Being on licence means that a person is still serving a prison sentence but can live in the community under strict conditions. As part of Jones' licence conditions he was not allowed to enter the surrounding four counties of Ms Bragg's home for a period of five years, but Ms Bragg said she began to feel \"trapped\". \"We hadn't got freedom anymore, not truly,\" she said. \"It may sound like a large area, but the clock was ticking. \"Just simply travelling and worrying about stopping at a service station that he might be there,\" she added. \"Being outside the safety zone did feel like a real a risk, and it shouldn't be like that.\" Ms Bragg recently found out that Jones had died. \"The morning after I'd been told that news, I couldn't work out what I was feeling, I couldn't put a name on it, it felt different, it wasn't familiar, and then it suddenly came to me - it was freedom,\" she said. \"Victims have been through enough already, we should all be able to feel freedom.\" Emma King said she had to \"fight\" for a five-mile exclusion zone around her home from the man who killed her sister. Julie Butcherwas murdered in 2005 by her ex-husbandRichard Butcher at their home in Chiseldon, Wiltshire. Butcher was jailed for 13 years but Ms King said he moved back to the same area after being released. \"We are actually imprisoned ourselves now in a small area and will be forever looking over our shoulders,\" said Ms King. She said 50-mile (80km) exclusion zones should be the minimum imposed on perpetrators, and that they should be imposed at sentencing to avoid further trauma for the families of victims. Ms King has joined forces with Carole Gould, whose17-year-old daughter Ellie was stabbed to deathat her home in Calne, Wiltshire, in 2019, by Thomas Griffiths after she ended their relationship. After hearing about Ms King's experiences, Ms Gould said she said she was \"horrified\". \"Naively I just thought Griffiths won't be allowed back to the south west of England [after being released] but hearing what Emma has to say, that means Griffiths could move back and live with his parents who have chosen not to move out of the area,\" Ms Gould said. \"They don't take into account the anxiety we're living with right now, let alone the grief, for what we should do for our long term plans. \"Should we move away or sit it out and see what happens?\" Diana Parkes, whose daughter Joanna Simpson was killed at her home in Berkshire in 2010, has also endorsed the calls for restricted zones. Ms Parkes, who set up theJoanna Simpson Trustin her daughter's name to support children affected by domestic abuse and homicide, said victims were \"absolutely terrified\" when perpetrators came out of prison. \"Every single victim I have spoken to endorses this feeling that the offender should be in a restricted zone and the victim should be able to carry on their life, because they've done nothing wrong,\" said Ms Parkes. \"Why should they only be made to feel safe in an exclusion zone? \"I'm fighting like mad until my dying breath to make sure people understand. Particularly the law makers, if they had lost a family member like us, they would really truly think differently.\" Latest Ministry of Justice data showed 62,821 people were on licence or subject to post release supervision as of September 2024. Craig Court, a solicitor at Harding Evans, in south Wales, who has represented both prisoners and victims of abuse, said introducing restricted zones in which offenders could live and work would pose a \"real risk\" of breaching the Human Rights Act 1998. He said the act had played a significant role in shaping how licence conditions were applied to offenders. \"Victims' campaigns have rightly highlighted the need for more restrictive conditions to ensure their safety and psychological wellbeing,\" said Mr Court. \"While I agree that such restrictive measures are crucial, especially where there is a continuing risk of harm, the act requires that any restriction - such as preventing an offender from entering certain areas - must comply with Article 5 [right to liberty] and Article 8 [right to private and family life] of the European Convention of Human Rights.\" Mr Court said these provisions did not prohibit restrictive conditions but did require them to be proportionate, necessary, and grounded in a clear assessment of ongoing risk. He said the aim was to protect the needs of victims whilst not undermining the fundamental rights of offenders. \"As the law currently stands, confining an offender to a particular area or restricting an offender from leaving a defined area runs the real risk of breaching both Articles 5 and or 8,\" he added. Ms Gould said she felt the emphasis should be \"flipped on its head\". \"It's all about the perpetrators' human rights and not ours, and that's so wrong,\" she said. \"The radius should be put on them. So we know where they are and we have the freedom of the UK.\" A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \"Victims must feel safe, which is why any offenders released on licence who break the rules face going back to prison. \"They have to follow strict conditions, such as curfews and exclusion zones that prevent them approaching their victims, as well as restrictions on phone and internet use.\" If you are affected by any of the issues in this article you can find details of organisations that can help via theBBC Action Line.

    "title": "Why South Africa and Ukraine are wooing each other - and what will Trump think?",
    "article_text": "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky is on a historic visit to South Africa, signalling a dramatic improvement in the once-strained relations between the two nations. The visit marks a diplomatic breakthrough for the Ukrainian leader in his efforts to counter Russia's strong - and growing - influence in Africa. \"I'm sure that Russia will be annoyed by the visit, but I don't think it can do much about it,\" said Steven Gruzd of the South African Institute of International Relations think-tank. Apart from a brief stopover in Cape Verde in 2023 while flying to Argentina, this is Zelensky's first visit to Africa since he became Ukraine's president in 2019. Ukraine grasped the diplomatic significance of African states, when many of them - including regional powerhouse South Africa - refused to condemn Russia's full-scale invasion of its territory in 2022. \"Ukraine neglected the continent in terms of foreign policy, but it has changed that over the last three years, doubling its embassies from 10 to 20,\" Mr Gruzd told the BBC. \"But it's in a very crowded space - Russia, China, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates are all trying to increase their influence in Africa.\" Zelensky's visit to South Africa at this point is especially significant, as Ukraine's relationship with the US - its main weapons supplier - has soured since US President Donald Trump took office in January. He has paused military aid, denounced Zelenksy as a \"dictator\", and has accused Ukraine of being responsible for the war. \"Ukraine needs every bit of legitimacy it can get internationally - not just in Europe.   Wars aren't only won in the battlefield, but also in courts of public opinion around the world,\" said Prof Siphamandla Zondi, a political analyst at the University of Johannesburg. For South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa, the visit is equally significant, as his country, too, is under intense pressure from the Trump administration. \"The US has turned diplomacy on its head,\" Mr Gudz said, adding: \"Everyone is looking for new friends.\" Ramaphosa sees Zelensky's visit as an attempt to boost his credentials as a peacemaker, saying their talks will focus on efforts to find \"a path to peace\". The South African leader added that he and Putin had held a phone conversation ahead of Zelensky's visit. \"We both affirmed the strong bilateral relations between our respective countries,\"Ramaphosa said in a post on X. \"We further committed to working together towards a peaceful resolution of the Russia-Ukraine conflict,\" he added. Ramaphosa first tried to assume the role of peacemaker in 2023 when he led a delegation of African leaders to both Kyiv and Moscow in an attempt to mediate an end to the conflict. The initiative came as South Africa faced a backlash from then-US President Joe Biden's administration, which questioned its professed neutrality in the conflict after it held a naval exercise with Russia and China. Relations worsened after Washington's then-ambassador to Pretoriaaccused South Africa of supplying arms and ammunition to Russia. Ramaphosa later appointed a judge-led inquiry to investigate the allegation. It found no evidence to back up the ambassador's claim, but relations between South Africa and the Biden administration remained strained. South Africa's ties with Russia have not been a sore point for Trump, as he too gets along with Putin and has been pushing Zelensky to make a deal with the Russian leader. However, Trump's relationship with South Africa has reached rock bottom over its genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and for what he calls the \"unjust and immoral practices\" against the white-minority Afrikaner community - an allegation Ramaphosa's government denies. Prof Zondi said South Africa would have to ensure that Ramaphosa's talks with Zelensky did not hurt its attempts to mend relations with the Trump administration. \"South Africa will want to explain that it is adding to the efforts to build peace, and its role is not in competition with that of [the] US,\" he added. The analyst said he also expected Ramaphosa to focus on strengthening trade ties with Ukraine, as South Africa's economy was in crisis, with low growth and high unemployment. \"Any volume of trade, no matter how small, is critical for South Africa,\" he said, adding that strong relations between the two nations could also benefit Ukraine in its efforts to extend its influence on the continent. \"South Africa could be Ukraine's gateway to Africa because of its ports and financial systems,\" Prof Zondi said. If this happens, it would mark a new chapter in Ukraine-Africa relations, though not necessarily at the expense of Russia. \"Both Russia and Ukraine are the biggest exporters of cereals to Africa. Africa needs both. It cannot be expected to choose sides,\" the analyst said. Go toBBCAfrica.comfor more news from the African continent.

    "title": "Five cards China holds in a trade war with the US",
    "article_text": "A trade war between the world's two biggest economies is now in full swing. Chinese exports to the US face up to 245% tariffs, and Beijing has hit back with a 125% levy on American imports. Consumers, businesses and markets are braced for more uncertainty as fears of a global recession have heightened. Chinese President Xi Jinping's government has repeatedly said it is open to dialogue, but warned that, if necessary, it would \"fight to the end\". Here's a look at what Beijing has in its arsenal to counter US President Donald Trump's tariffs. China is the world's second-largest economy, which means it can absorb the impacts of the tariffs better than other smaller countries. With more than a billion people, it also has a huge domestic market that could take some of the pressure off exporters who are reeling from tariffs. Beijing is still fumbling with the keys becauseChinese people are not spending enough. But with a range of incentives, from subsidies for household appliances to\"silver trains\"for travelling retirees, that could change. And Trump's tariffs have given the Chinese Communist Party an even stronger impetus to unlock the country's consumer potential. The leadership may \"very well be willing to endure the pain to avoid capitulating to what they believe is US aggression\", Mary Lovely, a US-China trade expert at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC, told BBC Newshour earlier this month. China also has a higher threshold for pain as an authoritarian regime, as it is far less worried about short-term public opinion. There is no election around the corner that will judge its leaders. Still, unrest is a concern, especially because there is already discontent over an ongoing property crisis and job losses. The economic uncertainty over tariffs is yet another blow for young people who have only ever known a rising China. The Party has been appealing to nationalist sentiments to justify its retaliatory tariffs, with state media calling on people to \"weather storms together\". President Xi Jinping may be worried but, so far, Beijing has struck a defiant and confident tone. One official assured the country: \"The sky will not fall.\" China has always been known as the world's factory - but it has been pouring billions into becoming a far more advanced one. Under Xi, it has been in a race with the US for tech dominance. It has invested heavily in homegrown tech, from renewables to chips to AI. Examples include the chatbot DeepSeek, which wascelebrated as a formidable rival to ChatGPT, and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) maker. Apple has been losing its prized market share to local competitors such as Huawei and Vivo. Recently Beijing announced plans to spend more than $1tn over the next decade to support innovation in AI. US companies have tried to move their supply chains away from China, but they have struggled to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere. Chinese manufacturers at every stage of the supply chain have given the country a decades-long advantage that will take time to replicate. That unrivalled supply chain expertise and government support have made China a formidable foe in this trade war - in some ways, Beijing has been preparing for this since Trump's previous term. Ever since Trump tariffs hit Chinese solar panels back in 2018, Beijing sped up its plans for a future beyond a US-led world order. It has pumped billions into acontentious trade and infrastructure programme, better known as the Belt and Road initiative, to shore up ties with the so-called Global South. The expansion of trade with South East Asia, Latin America and Africa comes as China tries to wean itself off the US. American farmers once supplied 40% of China's soybean imports - that figure now hovers at 20%. After the last trade war, Beijing ramped up soy cultivation at home and bought record volumes of the crop from Brazil, which is now its largest soybean supplier. \"The tactic kills two birds with one stone. It deprives America's farm belt of a once‑captive market and burnishes China's food security credentials,\" says Marina Yue Zhang, associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney's Australia-China Relations Institute. The US is no longer China's biggest export market: that spot now belongs to South East Asia. In fact China was the largest trading partner for 60 countries in 2023 - nearly twice as many as the US. The world's biggest exporter, it made a record surplus of $1tn at the end of 2024. That doesn't mean the US, the world's biggest economy, is not a crucial trading partner for China. But it does mean it's not going to be easy for Washington to back  China into a corner. Following reports that the White House will use bilateral trade negotiations to isolate China, Beijing has warned countries against\"reaching a deal at the expense of China's interests\". That would be animpossible choicefor much of the world \"We can't choose, and we will never choose [between China and the US],\" Malaysia's trade minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz told the BBC last week. Trump held firm as stocks plummeted following his sweeping tariffs announcement in early April, likening his staggering levies to \"medicine\". But he made a U-turn, pausing most of those tariffs for 90 days after a sharp sell-off in US government bonds. Also known as Treasuries, these have long been seen as a safe investment. But the trade war has shaken confidence in the assets. Trump has since hinted at a de-escalation in trade tensions with China, saying that the tariffs on Chinese goods will \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\". So, experts point out, Beijing now knows that the bond market can rattle Trump. China also holds $700bn in US government bonds. Japan, a staunch American ally, is the only non-US holder to own more than that. Some argue that this gives Beijing leverage: Chinese media has regularly floated the idea of selling or withholding purchases of US bonds as a \"weapon\". But experts warn that China will not emerge unscathed from such a situation. Rather, it will lead to huge losses for Beijing's investments in the bond market and destabilise the Chinese yuan. China will only be able to exert pressure with US government bonds \"only up to a point\", Dr Zhang says. \"China holds a bargaining chip, not a financial weapon.\" What China can weaponise, however, is its near monopoly in extracting and refining rare earths, a range of elements important to advanced tech manufacturing. China has huge deposits of these, such as dysprosium, which is used in magnets in electric vehicles and wind turbines, and Yttrium, which provides heat-resistant coating for jet engines. Beijing has already responded to Trump's latest tariffs by restricting exports of seven rare earths, including some that are essential for making AI chips. China accounts for about 61% of rare earths production and 92% of their refining, according to estimates by the International Energy Agency (IEA). While Australia, Japan and Vietnam have begun mining for rare earths, it will take years before China can be cut out of the supply chain. In 2024, China banned the export of another critical mineral, antimony, that is crucial to various manufacturing processes. Its price more than doubled amid a wave of panic buying and a search for alternative suppliers. The fear is that the same can happen to the rare earths market, which would severely disrupt various industries from electric vehicles to defence. \"Everything you can switch on or off likely runs on rare earths,\" Thomas Kruemmer, director of Ginger International Trade and Investment,told the BBCpreviously. \"The impact on the US defence industry will be substantial.\" The comments from the US Treasury Secretary come as the trade war between the world's two biggest economies has escalated. Tariffs are a key part of the US president's political vision but economists fear a global trade war. Face-scanning apps, social media influencers and toxic beauty standards are fuelling China's cosmetic surgery boom. Zhong Changchun was sentenced to death in January for attacking the boy who later died of his injuries. The toy, sold by Chinese company Pop Mart, has become the must-have fashion accessory.",

    "title": "The church Pope Francis kept returning to - and chose as his final resting place",
    "article_text": "Every time Pope Francis came back to Rome after a trip abroad, he made sure to pay a visit to the church of Santa Maria Maggiore. It was a fitting choice: Francis was particularly devoted to the Virgin Mary, and Santa Maria Maggiore was the first church to be dedicated to her when it was built in the 4th Century. It is one of Rome's four major basilicas and one of the oldest in the city. On Saturday, it will also become Francis's final resting place. It is a short walk from some of Rome's most recognisable landmarks like the Colosseum, and a stone's throw from the city's endlessly bustling and chaotic central Termini station. The diverse Esquilino neighbourhood is close by. Santa Maria Maggiore feels steeped in the \"real\" Rome – despite technically being a part of the Vatican state. The square it stands on - lined with bus stops, cafes and shops - certainly seems a world away from the awe-inspiring St Peter's Square and its imposing basilica, under which Popes are usually buried in centuries-old crypts. And yet the chapels, mosaics and gilded wood of Santa Maria Maggiore remain stunning. Seven other popes are buried here. The basilica also hosts what is said to be a relic of Jesus's crib and an icon of Mary, to whom Pope Francis would pray to asking for protection before a journey. Santa Maria Maggiore's senior priest, the Lithuanian Rolandas Makrickas, gave Italian newspaper Il Messaggero his account of how the Pope's decision to be laid to rest there came about. He said: \"In May 2022… I asked him if he wasn't by any chance thinking about being buried in [the basilica], given how often he came.\" Francis smiled and said that Popes are buried in St Peter's - \"and that was that\", Makrickas thought. The priest continued: \"A week later he called me and said, 'the Virgin Mary has told me to prepare my tomb'. \"Then he simply told me, 'find a place for it, because I want to be buried in this basilica and you've been a bit of a prophet'.\" The place Mackrickas found is next to the icon of Mary that the Pope so loved. It is now cordoned off and obscured by plywood. A security guard who wished to remain anonymous told BBC News stories of Pope Francis visiting the church on many occasions. \"Yes, we used to see him all the time when he came here,\" he said, interrupting himself to sternly invite tourists to put their phones away or cover their shoulders. \"After a few times of seeing him, one time he looked at me and asked me, 'why are you always here?' \"And I said, 'Holy Father, I'm working just as you are'.\" As the security guard spoke, people continued to stream in from the blazing sunshine into the quiet shade of the basilica. Several queued outside wooden booths, each topped with a sign indicating in which languages the priests inside could hear confessions. Every few minutes, the chatter would be momentarily quietened by a voice hissing over the loudspeaker: \"Silenzio.\" Outside, a woman called Pat from Manchester was squinting at the sun and gathering her thoughts. \"I came here because this is where the Pope used to come before any journey,\" she told the BBC, raising her voice over the sound of the midday bells tolling. \"That's why I've always wanted to come and it hasn't disappointed.\" After a pause, she said: \"Beautiful isn't the word. It's just vast, it's enormous.\" Apologising for not being able to put her emotions into words, she said she was \"particularly impressed\" that many of the six chapels hold different masses at different times, \"so if you're late for one, you can go into another\". Pat heard the news about the Pope's death when her plane from the UK landed in Rome on Monday morning. It did not scupper her visit. As a devout Catholic, she said Santa Maria Maggiore \"was always the place I wanted to come\" because Francis loved it so. \"I came without any sort of preconceived idea and I made a point of not reading up about it, I just wanted to take the atmosphere in, and feel it.\" \"And I did,\" she said, looking up at the basilica. \"I am full of the spirit.\" On Saturday afternoon, after the world has had a chance to bid farewell to him, Pope Francis will make his final journey from the Vatican to Santa Maria Maggiore, as he did so often in life. The church will be shut for a few hours, then the stream of visitors will resume. Some, like Pat, will continue to come to the basilica and try to put something intangible into words. Others will simply admire the mosaics. And on the left hand side, by an icon of the Virgin Mary, Santa Maria Maggiore's newest resident will begin his rest. Several names are prominent as cardinals prepare to gather in the Vatican to elect Pope Francis' successor. Pope Francis' funeral will take place outside St Peter's Basilica in the Vatican on Saturday. Tributes are being paid to Pope Francis following his death on Easter Monday at the age of 88. The LGBT+ Catholics Westminster Pastoral Council has praised the late Pope for improving relations. Despite having the world's fastest-growing Catholic population, odds are against Africa producing the next pontiff.",

    "title": "What is Doge and why is Musk stepping back?",
    "article_text": "Tesla boss Elon Musk has pledged to \"significantly\" cut back his role in Doge, the body tasked with reducing US government spending and cutting jobs. The Department of Government Efficiency has faced legal challenges over the scope of its work, and Musk and his team have been been criticised for a lack of transparency. However, polling suggests its cost-cutting agenda has widespread support. Despite its full name, Doge is not an official government department, which can only be established by an act of Congress. Instead the advisory body was created by an executive order signed by US President Donald Trump. Part of Doge's mission, according to the order, relates to IT upgrades aimed at boosting efficiency. It must finish its work by July 2026. Many Doge staff appear to be young people with tech backgrounds and limited or no government experience. Yes. Musk initially said he would perform his role as an outside volunteer but the White House later confirmed he would operate as an unpaid special government employee. That designation covers those working for the government for no more than 130 days in a year. Supporters argued that the body's outsider status - and somewhat vague mandate - would increase its effectiveness. \"They're a little more untethered to the bureaucracy itself and to the systems that slow processes down around here,\" Republican Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota told the BBC. \"I think the lack of parameters is part of what will make them effective.\" In an unexpected appearance at the White House in February,Musk denied leading a \"hostile takeover\" of the US government, and defended his approach. \"The people voted for major government reform and that's what the people are going to get,\" he said. \"That's what democracy is all about.\" He also made a number ofexaggerated and unsupported claimsduring the event. Musk said his \"time allocation to Doge\" would \"drop significantly\" from May to one to two days per week, after accusations he had taken his focus off Tesla. His political involvement has sparked global protests and boycotts against the company's cars. In April, the firm said sales had fallen to their lowest level in three years and warned investors that \"changing political sentiment\" could continue to hurt demand. Musk was already due to reach his 130-day limit on government work in late May, but it is not clear whether he will step down completely. He pledged to stay on \"as long as the president would like me to do so and as long as it's useful\". Musk said Doge's mission was to end the \"tyranny of the bureaucracy\", save taxpayers' money and reduce US national debt, which stands at $36tn (£28.9tn). Initially he said he hoped to save as much as $2tn a year, but later tempered this estimate. It is not clear how much money Doge has managed to save so far, although its X account gives regular, celebratory updates about its activities. These have included shuttering government agencies, defunding programmes and mass layoffs: Polling in February by the BBC's US partner CBS News suggested that Doge had popular appeal. It indicated that a majority of Americans - especially Republican voters - backed its work. David Ditch, a senior analyst at the Economic Policy Innovation Center, a conservative think tank, insists Doge's work is necessary: \"They're shining a very bright spotlight on various parts of the federal government and they're asking -  whether it's the American public, whether it's moderate members of the Republican caucus - is this how you want America's tax dollars to be used?\" But even some of those who support Doge's work appear to dislike Musk himself. In February, Pew Research found that 54% of Americans had an unfavourable view of him, including 37% who said their view was \"very unfavourable\". Political opponents and government watchdogs have criticised Doge for acting without transparency and spreading misinformation about government spending - and accuse Musk of overstepping his authority as an unelected official. They highlight potential conflicts of interest, given Musk's businesses hold contracts with the US government worth billions. Trump and Musk deny that any conflicts have arisen. Democrats accuse them of tampering with funding approved by Congress that is outside the president's scope. The White House denies that the work has broken any laws. Multiple groups including unions and state attorneys general have sued Doge and the wider Trump administration over their plans. On several occasions the courts have stepped in to halt the cost-cutting moves, at least once blocking Doge directly when a judge stopping the agency from accessing personal data held within US Treasury records. Many analysts remain sceptical about whether Doge can deliver on its bold pledges. Elaine Kamark from the Brookings Institution said government spending could be streamlined, highlighting her own work for President Bill Clinton in the 1990s. But she described Musk's goal to slash a third of government spending as \"ridiculous\", since so much of the budget was mandatory, including popular programmes like Social Security and Medicare. Aged just 10 when his father first became president, he's now well over six feet tall, and goes to New York University. The US president spoke about his plans for the second Trump administration, as well as criticising the 'corrupt establishment'. Watch the historic moment when the 45th president is returned to power as he takes the oath of office. Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos were among those invited inside the Capitol for Donald Trump's swearing in. Thousands of people joined in on demonstrations as the United States prepares to inaugurate its new president. The outgoing US president warned against power in the hands of the wealthy, the threat of the tech industry and climate change. Trump's pick for US attorney general was pressed on claims of election fraud and pardons for January 6 rioters. Donald Trump's defence secretary nominee was asked about his stance on women in combat and his alleged excessive drinking. Harris, who Trump defeated in the 2024 election, presided over the event as required by the US Constitution. Among the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans. The president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. The suspect used an “improvised incendiary device” to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election. A week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds. Republicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years. The president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power. Given all the things they’ve said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump’s meeting could be really awkward. 'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton. The Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him. The president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory. After Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign. The conspiracy theorist reportedly urged Trump to fire several National Security Council officials, a claim denied by the president. The Vances met as students, when they joined a discussion group on “social decline in white America”. Indian Americans are optimistic about India’s future, but wary of US-India ties under a second Trump term. The conservative from Ohio shot to fame writing about his hard upbringing and is now next in line to the US presidency. Trump's inner circle includes the world's richest man, a former NFL player, and a Wall Street financer.",

    "title": "'Extraordinary world-views': Turner Prize nominees revealed",
    "article_text": "A learning disabled artist, a former Iraqi refugee and one of the youngest ever nominees are among the artists shortlisted for this year's Turner Prize. Nnena Kalu, Mohammed Sami, Zadie Xa and Rene Matić - who at 27 is the second youngest artist to be nominated after Damien Hirst - are all in the running for the prestigious annual art prize, the Tate announced on Wednesday. An exhibition of their work will be held at the Cartwright Hall Art Gallery from September as part of Bradford's UK City of Culture celebrations. The winner, who will be awarded £25,000, will then be announced on 9 December at a ceremony in the West Yorkshire city. Alex Farquharson, director of Tate Britain and chair of the Turner Prize jury, said the shortlist \"reflects the breadth of artistic practice today, from painting and sculpture to photography and installation\". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the artists, who are each guaranteed to receive £10,000, offer \"extraordinary world-views that are very personal\". Take a closer look at all four shortlisted artists and their work: Glasgow-bornNnena Kalu(above), who has limited verbal communication, has been a resident artist with Action Space, which supports artists with learning disabilities, for more than 25 years. She creates large-scale swirling abstract drawings and sculpures made from colourful streams of repurposed fabrics and materials such as reels of VHS tape. The jury praised her \"unique command of material, colour and gesture and her highly attuned responses to architectural space\". Photographer, writer and poetRene Matić, from Peterborough, is nominated for solo exhibition As Opposed To The Truth at CCA Berlin, which touches on the rise of right-wing populism and identities. Matić captures \"fleeting moments of joy in daily life, and expressions of tenderness within a wider political context\", according to Tate, using intimate photos of family and friends placed in an installation which also includes objects like the artist's collection of children's black dolls bought in second-hand shops. Their work looks at themes including \"the constructed self through the lens of rudeness\" and rudeboy culture, a Jamaican subculture. The jury said they were \"struck by the artist's ability to express concerns around belonging and identity\". Mohammed Samihails from Baghdad and his work draws on his life and experiences during the Iraq war and as a refugee in Sweden. The artist is recognised for solo exhibition After the Storm at Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire, and the jury were impressed by his \"powerful representation\" of war and exile. His large-scale paintings explore memory and loss, layering patterns and colours to create \"haunting, dreamlike scenes\". Zadie Xacomes from Vancouver, Canada, and her work is inspired by her Korean heritage and the importance of shamanic beliefs. Interweaving paintings, murals, traditional patchwork textiles and 650 brass bells that make harmonised sounds inspired by Korean shamanic ritual bells, Xa's art focuses on the sea as \"a spiritual realm to explore traditions and folklore, speaking to a multitude of cultures\". The jury felt the \"vibrant installation\" was a \"sophisticated development\" of her work. Established in 1984, the prize is named after radical painter JMW Turner -who would have turned 250 on Wednesday- and is awarded each year to a British-based  artist for an \"outstanding exhibition or other presentation of their work\". Shanaz Gulzar, creative director Bradford UK City of Culture 2025, said it was \"a huge honour and privilege\" to bring the prize tothe city that gave the world David Hockney. \"Bradford has produced some amazing artists, literary artists, visual artists, contemporary artists,\" she told Radio 4. \"And to have these four artists in Bradford, I think really speaks to how we're delivering our year so far, and it speaks to our audiences.\" Last year's prize was won by Jasleen Kaur, who used a vintage Ford Escort, worship bells and Irn-Bru to celebrate the Scottish Sikh community. Other ther previous winners have included Sir Anish Kapoor (1991), Damien Hirst (1995) and Sir Steve McQueen (1999). The projection is part of celebrations for the 250th anniversary of JMW Turner's birth. A Right Royal Heist exhibition will open at Lincoln Cathedral on 3 May. He was known for gigantic and often controversial monuments, including some taller than the Statue of Liberty. Artist Farrah Fortnam said she wants to raise the issue of rewilding and inspire \"hope and joy\". More than 65 seaside images are set to be displayed across the East Sussex city.",

    "title": "How long are people having to wait to take their driving test?",
    "article_text": "BBC Verify has found that three quarters of the 319 driving test centres across Great Britain have hit the maximum average waiting time - of 24 weeks - to book a practical test. This is the backdrop to thegovernment's announcementof measures to deal with the delays, which include training more driving examiners and dealing with the issue of bots - automated software - booking up test slots. The driving tests backlog has been largely building since the Covid pandemic and has been rising since Labour came to power. BBC Verify obtained data from the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) - the body that runs driving tests - in a Freedom of Information request. The data reveals that as of 24 March 2025: Millie Moyler from Buckinghamshire is nearly 19 years old and has been learning to drive for almost two years. She has been trying to book a test since September 2023. She says it has been a \"strain\" on her mental health. Her mum Sara is in a WhatsApp group where she says \"hundreds of tests are being sold every week for all locations\" at a cost of £200 a test. Theofficial driving test feeis £62 for weekdays and £75 for evenings, weekends and bank holidays. Neither Millie nor her mum wish to take this route saying it is \"morally wrong\" and \"compounds the problem\". \"It's been a ridiculous process,\" she says. \"Driving is a basic life skill and it shouldn't be this much of a problem.\" She has now managed to book a test for July, but is worried that if she fails it she will have to wait another two years and keep having to pay for lessons in the meantime to keep her skills up. Waiting times have increased sharply since the pandemic. At the start of 2020 the average waiting time was six weeks. Driving tests were suspended completely several times during the Covid outbreak, while there were other times when they were only available for emergency workers and key workers. That took the average waiting time up to 15 weeks by the end of the pandemic. The DVSA also says that people are booking their tests much earlier in the learning process meaning they are not always ready by the time their test comes up. It encourages learners - through its 'Ready to Pass?' campaign - to only book their driving test when their instructor agrees they are ready. Nonetheless, waiting times rose considerably in early 2023. Then there was a temporary fall from October 2023 when the government announced that for six months qualified examiners who were not at the time giving tests would be redeployed. The government has now announced that redeployment will happen again and overtime payments for examiners will be allowed. The government has also been talking about how it will tackle bots, which are automated programmes that can find and secure available test slots more quickly than individual customers. The DVSA has urged people not to buy test slots through social media channels, warning that they may be scams and that people could have to pay more for a test than the official fee. In January, the government changed the test-booking rules so that: Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has now announced she will be launching an \"accelerated consultation\" in May to improve the booking system and block bots from accessing tests. Tests are made available 24 weeks - almost six months - in advance. It is not possible to book more than 24 weeks in advance. The average waiting time is the number of weeks it will be at a test centre until 10% of tests are available for a particular week. For example, in a test centrewith 175 tests available each week, the average waiting time is the first week when 18 or more appointments are still available to book. Additional reporting by Gerry Georgieva, Daniel Wainwright and Kris Bramwell Correction: an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Oswestry was in Wales. What do you want BBC Verify to investigate? Dylan Whiteley, 17, has been trying to book a test for seven weeks, without success. Transport secretary Heidi Alexander said the government would provide at least 10,000 extra driving tests a month. A bereaved mum is calling for the government to introduce graduate licences for young drivers. The Welsh government say it wants to reduce two-year waits for patients to 8,000 by March. Attempts to cheat at both theory and practical driving tests are being detected in Kent, Surrey and Sussex.",

    "article_text": "A judge has ordered that Scottish schools must provide single-sex toilets for students after parents brought a case to court against Scottish Borders Council (SBC). The local authority had installed only gender neutral toilets at the replacement Earlston primary school, which recently opened. Parents Sean Stratford and Leigh Hurley complained to the council about the policy at the school their son had previously attended, but it was rejected. But at the Court of Session in Edinburgh the council conceded that they had a legal obligation to provide male and female facilities. The move comes after judges at the UK Supreme Court last week unanimously ruled that a woman isdefined by biological sexunder equalities law. Rosie Walker, of law firm Gilson Gray which is representing the parents, said: \"This case will have far reaching implications.\" BBC Scotland News understands that the Scottish government is confident that the vast majority of schools in Scotland already offer single-sex lavatories. Ministers are still considering the implication of the Supreme Court judgement and whether any changes will have to be made to toilet provisions. Ms Walker said all schools in Scotland would now have to \"urgently review\" whether half of their toilets are for boys and half for girls, as is required by theSchool Premises (General Requirements and Standards) (Scotland) Regulations 1967. She added: \"This case, on top of the Supreme Court decision last week, gives focus to the importance of protecting sex-based rights and single-sex spaces.\" A council spokesperson said: \"Prior to the hearing, SBC had accepted and acknowledged the decision that was being sought was correct and therefore did not seek to defend this in court. \"Moving forward, SBC will revisit and reconsider the complaint and respond in due course.\" The Scottish government said it would carefully consider the implications of that ruling. A spokesperson added: \"Local authorities have statutory responsibility for the school estate, including provision of toilets. \"The Scottish government is committed to ensuring that our Transgender Guidance for Schools remains up to date and fit for purpose. \"As with any significant legal or policy developments, we will consider whether the guidance requires to be updated to reflect upon these.\" They added the social justice secretary and the health secretary will meet with the  Equality and Human Rights Commission - which will soon publish guidance on the issue - on Thursday. Updated guidance is expected following last week's Supreme Court ruling that sex is biological. The PM says the Supreme Court ruling brought clarity and now is the time to \"lower the temperature\" on the debate.

    "article_text": "Kemi Badenoch has rejected claims of a rift with shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick over whether the party should form a pact with Reform UK. The Conservative leader has always ruled out an electoral pact with Reform UK, arguing that Nigel Farage's party is seeking to destroy the Tories. In a leaked recordingobtained by Sky News,Jenrick said he wanted the \"fight\" against Labour at the next general election to be \"united\" and he was \"determined\" to \"bring this coalition together\". Asked about Jenrick's comments on Wednesday, Reform leader Farage told GB News: \"I think my supporters would be revolted.\" The story was seized on by Labour and the Lib Dems, who urged Badenoch to sack her former leadership rival for contradicting her - but her spokesman insisted there were no differences between them. \"Kemi Badenoch has made perfectly clear there will be absolutely no electoral pact with Reform. \"If you actually read the shadow justice secretary's words, he is saying he is working to defeat Reform. The coalition he's talking about is of centre-right voters and bringing them together,\" the spokesman told reporters. Asked if Badenoch considered Jenrick a \"team player\", the spokesman said: \"Yes, the shadow cabinet is a well-functioning team.\" He said Badenoch had not been aware of Jenrick's comments ahead of them being obtained by Sky, but it was \"demonstrably true\" that the right is not \"united\" and that the Tories needed to get millions of voters back from Reform UK. And he hit back at claims Badenoch, who beat Jenrick to the Tory crown in a vote of members last November, should \"rein him in\" for writing articles and speeches that went beyond his shadow ministerial brief. \"It is fine for shadow cabinet members and MPs to talk about things that are in the advancement of the Conservative Party,\" he told reporters. The Tory leader struck a similarly relaxed tone when asked by the BBC if Jenrick was undermining her leadership with his comments on Reform. \"No, not at all,\" she replied. \"I mean we have to be realistic. The Conservatives lost a lot of seats not just because of Labour doing better, but because we lost a lot of votes to Reform so of course we want those voters to come back to us, just as the ones who went to the Lib Dems and Labour we want them to come back to us.\" She added that the party could only tempt voters back with a \"visibly centre-right, authentic Conservative offer\". Farage was equally unenthusiastic about the potential for a deal with either Jenrick or the Tories, telling GB News: \"I can only deal with people who I could trust. I don't trust them.\" He added: \"We had 14 years of the Conservative party. \"Tax is the highest since 1947, the state growing, the civil service growing, mass immigration at levels even Tony Blair couldn't dream of. \"They let people down by every single measure.\" Earlier, at a fiery Prime Minister's Questions, Badenochattacked Sir Keir Starmer for lacking the \"balls\"to say what he really thought about the transgender issue. The PM hit back, saying no Tory MPs thought she would be the Conservative leader at the next general election. He added that Jenrick - who was absent from the chamber - was \"away plotting,\" and that he would be left \"fighting over the bones of the Tory party\" with Nigel Farage, who he said would \"eat the Tory party for breakfast\". In the recording at the centre of the controversy, which was made in March this years at a local Tory event, Jenrick can be heard talking about how Reform UK could make life difficult for his party. \"You head towards a general election, where the nightmare scenario is that Keir Starmer sails in through the middle as a result of the two parties being disunited. \"I don't know about you, but I'm not prepared for that to happen.\" He added: \"I want the fight to be united. And so, one way or another, I'm determined to do that and bring this coalition together and make sure we unite as a nation as well.\" A source close to Jenrick told PA Media on Wednesday that he had no differences with his party leader on ruling out a pact with Reform. \"Rob's comments are about voters and not parties. \"He's clear we have to put Reform out of business and make the Conservatives the natural home for all those on the right, rebuilding the coalition of voters we had in 2019 and can have again. \"But he's under no illusions how difficult that is - we have to prove over time we've changed and can be trusted again.\" Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletterto keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond.

    "title": "Call to fine 'headphone dodgers' who play music on buses",
    "article_text": "The Liberal Democrats are calling for fines of up to £1,000 for \"headphone dodgers\" who play loud music and videos on public transport. Current railway byelaws already ban many forms of anti-social behaviour on trains and at stations, including using equipment to produce sound without permission if this annoys others. However, the Lib Dems want to change the law to explicitly ban playing music and videos out loud from a phone on trains and buses in England. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: \"There are already strict rules in place to prevent anti-social behaviour on public transport, including possible fines of up to £1,000.\" The government is also introducing further measures to tackle anti-social behaviour on buses, including mandatory training for staff on how to respond to incidents. The idea has cross-party support, with some Labour and Tory MPs previously suggesting similar measures. However, without government support the Lib Dem proposals are unlikely to become law. A survey of more than 2,000 UK adults for the Lib Dems, conducted by Savanta, found 38% had experienced people playing music out loud often or sometimes. Some 54% of people would not feel comfortable asking someone to turn down their music on public transport, the findings suggest. The figure was higher for women (63%) then men (46%). The Lib Dems said they would try to amend the Bus Service Bill, which is currently making its way through Parliament and is due to be debated by peers next week, to introduce the changes. The party said it also wanted existing railway byelaws to be amended to make clear playing music and videos out loud from a phone counts as unacceptable behaviour and should be punishable with a fine of up to £1,000. It said this should be accompanied by a national publicity campaign, including posters on train platforms and at bus stops. Currently passengers who breach bylaws can be removed from trains or stations, with a maximum fine of £1,000. Existing regulations also allow passengers to be removed from buses if they play sounds which are likely to annoy others. Liberal Democrat Home Affairs spokeswoman Lisa Smart said: \"Far too many people dread their daily commute because of the blight of anti-social behaviour - and headphone dodgers playing loud music on buses and trains are some of the worst offenders. \"Whether you're heading to work, taking your kids to school, or simply trying to enjoy a moment of peace, everyone deserves to feel safe and respected on public transport.\" She added: \"It's time to take a stand for the quiet majority who just want to get from A to B in peace.\" Conservative shadow transport secretary Gareth Bacon said: \"Playing loud music on public transport may seem like a small thing, but it speaks towards a growing tolerance of anti-social behaviour that chips away at public civility.\" He added that the Conservative Party supports \"common-sense reforms like this\" but \"any new byelaws must be backed by stepping up enforcement - something the Liberal Democrats' plan fails to deliver\".

    "title": "China sends Boeing planes back to US over tariffs",
    "article_text": "China has sent back planes it ordered from the US in its latest retaliation over Trump tariffs, the boss of aircraft maker Boeing has said. Kelly Ortberg said two planes had already been returned and another would follow after trade tensions between the two countries escalated. Boeing's chief executive told CNBC that 50 more planes were due to go to China this year but their customers had indicated they will not take delivery of them. The US put 145% tariffs on imports from China and it hit back with a 125% tax on US products. Speaking in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump said he wasoptimistic about improving trade relations with China, saying the level of tariffs he had imposed would \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\". However, Mr Ortberg said China \"have in fact stopped taking delivery of aircraft because of tariff environment\". Boeing is America's largest exporter with about 70% of its commercial aircraft sales outside of the US. Mr Ortberg said Boeing was assessing options to re-market 41 of the already built planes to other customers as there was high demand from other airlines. He said there were nine planes not yet in Boeing's production system and he wanted to \"understand their intentions and if necessary we can assign to other customers\". He added Boeing was \"not going continue to build aircraft for customers who will not take them\". Later in the afternoon, Mr Ortberg told an investor call \"there is not a day that goes by that we're not engaged with either cabinet secretaries or either POTUS himself (President Trump) regarding the trade war between China and the USA.\" He added he was \"very hopeful we'll get to some negotiations\". On Wednesday, America's Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told the International Monetary Fund (IMF) conference there was anopportunity for a \"big deal\" between the US and China on trade. Asked about an upcoming meeting between the countries, Bessent said it would be an \"incredible opportunity\" to strike an agreement, if China was \"serious\" on making its economy less dependent on manufacturing exports. Mr Ortberg also told investors others in the Boeing supply chain were now exposed to tariffs - mainly in Japan and Italy where universal tariffs of 10% are being implemented. Brian West, Boeing's chief financial officer said during the call \"free trade policy is very important to us\" and Boeing will continue to work to with suppliers to ensure continuity. Boeing has reported smaller losses for the first quarter of the year after it manufactured and delivered more planes. Production had slumped in 2024 due to a series of crises and a strike by about 30,000 American factory workers. It wants to increase output of its 737 MAX jets to 38 a month in 2025.

    "title": "Letter reveals Shakespeare did not abandon his wife",
    "article_text": "The relationship between William Shakespeare and his wife Anne Hathaway may have been happier than previously thought, according to new research. For more than 200 years it has been believed that Shakespeare left his wife in Stratford-upon-Avon when he travelled to London and that a decision to leave her almost nothing in his will meant he probably felt bitterness towards her. However, examination of a fragment of a letter, which is addressed to \"good Mrs Shakespeare\", appears to show they did live together in central London between 1600-1610. The research was carried out by Prof Matthew Steggle from the University of Bristol's Department of English. In the letter, which was preserved by accident in the binding of a book in Hereford, it is alleged that Shakespeare is withholding money from an orphan boy named John Butts, with the letter asking Mrs Shakespeare for money instead. Prof Steggle said: \"First discovered in 1978, the letter's been known for a while, but no-one could identify the names or places involved or see any reason to think that the Mr Shakespeare in the letter was necessarily William rather than anyone else of the same name in the general period. \"So, it's a story about the Shakespeares' marriage, really, as well as about Shakespeare's London contacts. \"And if the writing on the back of the letter is a reply, then it's also a story about the first ever bit of writing which can be attributed to Anne Hathaway.\" The letter refers to the boy being a fatherless apprentice and through his research Prof Steggle says there was only one person in London called John Butts who fits that criterion. The letter also refers to a Trinity Lane and of the four married couples called Shakspaire (spelling of the time) known to be in London in that period, only William and Anne are likely to have lived in that area. \"It at least doubles the number of letters known to be addressed to or sent from Shakespeare and his family,\" Prof Steggle said. \"Currently, there's only one known. It also shows a side of Shakespeare's London life that's not been known before, giving him a new address in Trinity Lane and a whole new sphere of activity for him.\" Prof Steggle said it \"opens the door\" to the idea Shakespeare's wife did indeed spend \"significant\" time with her husband in London. \"It's not a complete slam dunk,\" he told the BBC. \"It's a possibility that seems difficult to avoid, rather than a certainty.\" Speaking on BBC Radio 4's World at One programme, author Maggie O'Farrell, whose book Hamnet is a fictionalised account of the marriage between Shakespeare and his wife as they deal with the loss of their son, called the discovery \"thrilling\" and \"wonderful\". \"There have been very respected scholars who've said that she was ugly, that Shakespeare hated her, that she trapped him into marriage, that she was illiterate, that she was stupid,\" Ms O'Farrell said. \"There is absolutely not one shred of evidence for any of that and it's always baffled me as to why she attracts all this vilification and all this misogyny. \"And it's so wonderful to find this tiny fragment of a letter which was discovered in the binding of a book that was published in 1608, that proves of course that they did love each other and probably lived together for some time in London.\" Follow BBC Bristol onFacebook,XandInstagram.

    "title": "An inner drive mistaken for laziness: The makings of Van Dijk",
    "article_text": "An inner drive mistaken for laziness: The makings of Van Dijk Suddenly he was back where it all began. Last month Virgil van Dijk made a secret visit to his old Dutch club Willem II to bring back a youth football tournament. He said: \"It's my way of giving back and helping nurture the next generation of world-class talent. This tournament gives rising stars the platform they need to take the next step towards their dreams.\" Fittingly, the next edition of the 'Virgil Legacy Trophy' in September will feature all of the clubs where Van Dijk played in his career, plus the likes of Arsenal, Manchester City and PSG. And it was in Tilburg, a Dutch city in the southern province of North Brabant, where the current Liverpool captain gained invaluable insights about football and life. As he prepares to lift his second Premier League title with Liverpool, we look at how the 33-year-old centre-back learned from early setbacks to become one of the best in the world. Liverpool one point from title - but when could they clinch it? Van Dijk joined Willem II's then-acclaimed academy in 2001 as a 10-year-old. It was a club that had defied the odds just a few years earlier by finishing second in the Eredivisie in 1998-99 and reaching the Champions League. Shortly after his arrival, Jan van Loon was installed as academy director. \"There was actually no striker who stood a chance against him,\" Van Loon said. \"He was physically strong and he had a natural talent to take balls off opponents at exactly the right moment. \"I remember in games we would sometimes say to him: 'Watch out Virgil, there is an opponent behind you.' He would be very relaxed, like: 'Yeah, OK, no worries.' \"I recall a game against Ajax, where he would mark their best player. We were saying 'make sure he doesn't touch any ball,' and that's exactly what Virgil would do.\" Yet there was still room for improvement, Van Loon, added: \"So now and then he could come across as laconic, a bit too easy going. Maybe at times some youth managers even thought of him as lazy.\" That image was partly created by his timekeeping, as Van Dijk would sometimes arrive late for training sessions. It even got to the point where some coaches wondered whether the young defender should remain at the club. But when Van Loon took a closer interest in the young footballer, he also gained insight into Van Dijk's personal life. He said: \"His parents were divorced and at times he had to look after his younger brother and sister. Sometimes he had to take them from school and make them lunch, before jumping on the bus to Willem II. \"That meant he could be late now and then, and if I asked him about the reasons he would always explain in detail what had happened. \"One time I remember his little brother had asked him for peanut butter on his bread, something he had to go and get in the supermarket - and subsequently he just missed the bus. That period has shaped him both as a human and footballer.\" Virgil van Dijk made his debut for Groningen in May 2011 Van Dijk's impressive performances finally saw him offered a chance to play for the second team, when he was playing for Willem's under-19s. But on the day of the match he had to submit a report for school, which he hadn't completed. School was paramount for the club, so he risked missing his big break, \"I said to Virgil: 'Let's look for a solution together',\" Van Loon added. \"He was really popular with his classmates, not because he was a footballer but just as a human being. \"He asked a few of his peers and everything was done in time. Not that they wrote the assignment, but they did help him. The night before the game I got a message from the teacher saying everything was fine. \"That teacher also played his part. That's why I always say it takes a village to raise a child. You need several people around you to push you in the right direction.\" Van Loon, who also had a spell as head of coaching at Arsenal's academy, noticed how Van Dijk nurtured his people skills by recognising who could help him. He said: \"He developed a skill to assemble people around him who would be best for his career. He would ask for extra attention from the best staff members, because he instinctively felt they could make him better. \"That was very special, I also saw that with players like Bukayo Saka and Frenkie de Jong, who was also in the academy of Willem II. \"At the club there was an exercise physiologist, who knew how to relate strength training to the role of centre-back. When exercises were finished, Virgil said: 'No, we'll continue for a while.' There you could see his inner drive, even though some other coaches had an impression that he was lazy.\" As a teenager, Van Dijk combined his time playing at the Willem II academy with a part-time job as a dishwasher. But, despite growing in stature and switching from right-back to centre-back, not everyone was convinced by Van Dijk at Willem and clubs hesitated to offer him a first professional contract. \"Inside the club there wasn't a unanimous opinion about him and I think Virgil felt that, that the opinions of the technical people were divided,\" Van Loon said. FC Groningen took the opportunity and signed a 19-year-old Van Dijk in 2010 - despite Willem finally making him an offer. The defender felt his own club were late with their offer and opted to take a different path in his career. He made his professional debut in May 2011 and impressed in his first full season the year after - until serious illness stopped him in his tracks. It took two trips to different hospitals to diagnose him with appendicitis, peritonitis and a kidney infection, and he had to be operated on straight away. Van Dijk, said at the time: \"My body was broken and I couldn't do anything. At such a moment, the worst scenarios are whizzing around your head. For the first time in my life, football was very much a side issue. My life was at risk. \"At some point I had to sign some papers. It was a kind of testament. If I died, a part of my money would go to my mum.\" Virgil van Dijk won the Champions League with Liverpool The operation went well but, despite a quick recovery and some impressive performances, the top clubs in Holland didn't express a big interest. It was then Celtic signed him for about Â£2.5m in 2013. \"He came in the first day and trained. I had a chat with him and said 'enjoy yourself here because I don't think you'll be here long',\" then manager Neil Lennon recalls. \"He's got pace, composure, physicality, technically brilliant. The progress was impossible to stop. He was such a good player - probably the best I've worked with as a manager.\" After two seasons, including two league titles and a Scottish Cup, Van Dijk moved to Southampton. \"I always thought he had the game and he's proven that,\" said Lennon. \"He could play for any team in the world and I'm surprised Manchester United or Manchester City, Barcelona or Real Madrid didn't come in and buy him rather than Liverpool at the time.\" Van Dijk became the world's most expensive defender when he signed for Liverpool in 2018 for Â£75m. He has since won the Champions League, Premier League, an FA Cup, two League Cups, the Club World Cup and won the 2019 UEFA player of the year award. He is now just one win away from his second Premier League title. Van Loon, said: \"He has adapted to new and more challenging situations. He has become captain and the way he deals with the coaching staff and press is very impressive. \"I'm very proud of what he has achieved. And he did it himself, there is no-one who solved things for him. \"He had to pull the strings and take the initiative. It gives such a boost to young people who may also start with nothing and who work to achieve their goals in life.\" Four Premier League clubs eyeing Huijsen Latest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views Get Liverpool news sent straight to your phone Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "Returning O'Sullivan feared Crucible 'meltdown'",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played 'I loved being out there!' O'Sullivan charges into last 16 Ronnie O'Sullivan has said he was \"worried\" about returning to snooker, fearing he would \"implode\" and \"have a meltdown\" in his first competitive match since January. O'Sullivan, 49, beat Ali Carter 10-4 on Wednesday in the first round of the World Championship, a competition he has won seven times. However, his participation in the tournament was only confirmed late last week after he went three months without playing competitively following an incident at the Championship League in January in which he snapped his cue and threw it in a bin. \"I lost the buzz for playing because I wasn't able to execute shots,\" said O'Sullivan. \"I was bailing out of shots. I was having to play a different game that I didn't enjoy and it didn't feel like I could express myself, so it got really tough.\" Ronnie O'Sullivan has won the World Snooker Championship seven times and is aiming to become the first man in the modern era to gain eight titles Asked if there were times in the past week where he thought he had made a mistake about returning to snooker, O'Sullivan said: \"Yeah, totally. \"I thought 'what am I doing coming here, exposing myself, [potentially] imploding out there, having a meltdown?' All that went through my head. I told [sports psychiatrist] Steve Peters that and he said 'I'm coming - I will get you through the first match'. \"I was quite a bit scared coming and playing. It's a daunting venue to play at anyway but it's about getting on the bike again and playing and I'm really proud that I've done that. \"Even if I had lost, it didn't really matter. I made that breakthrough. There's still a lot of work to do.\" O'Sullivan scored 504 points in five frames on Wednesday, compared with just 43 for Ali Carter In Tuesday's first session against two-time Crucible finalist Carter, neither player was at their best, with it seemingly finely balanced at 5-4 to O'Sullivan. But on Wednesday, 'The Rocket' was in sensational form, winning all five frames and not letting Carter score a point in four of them. O'Sullivan made breaks of 59, 117, 74, 123 and 131, but in the post-match news conference stressed he was trying to \"rebuild\" his technique after losing faith in his ability. He said: \"I couldn't even watch myself play as I could see what was wrong. I just couldn't correct it and every time you make a change you think 'this is terrible'. \"I've changed my alignment, changed certain things. I had lost all connection with the cue, the timing had gone, the touch had gone, feeling had gone. Years and years of that mounted up and it got to the point where I couldn't play and it got too much. \"It got to the point where I couldn't pull the cue forwards and backwards, which was quite scary.\" O'Sullivan beat Carter in the Crucible finals in 2008 and 2012 Four seeded players, including world champions Kyren Wilson and Neil Robertson and last year's runner-up Jak Jones have been eliminated from O'Sullivan's half of the draw. Chinese qualifier Pang Junxu is his opponent in the second round, although O'Sullivan said he enjoyed his Crucible return because he had not placed any expectations on himself. \"This game can humble you so many times,\" said O'Sullivan. \"To play one good session. It was a nice feeling and I did enjoy being out there. \"I didn't feel too nervous because my expectation levels were maybe just to get a few frames and see where we go. I didn't feel pressure and normally when I come here with a half-decent game I feel pressure more as it is a chance to go deep [into the draw], but on this occasion I wasn't expecting to do much. \"I'm going to give myself two years. No more exhibitions, no more distractions off the table. It might take one month, six months, a year and give it a good go. I owe it to snooker and to myself. I just have to put everything into this tournament.\" Carter felt O'Sullivan would claim an eighth world title if he could maintain the form he showed on Wednesday. \"No question, no-one can live with that,\" said the world number 18. \"He could've had 10 years off and still come here. He is a freak natural, that's why you love to watch him - he played fabulously well. \"When the opponent is potting all the balls every mistake is highlighted and you just have to sit and watch and hope. He looks like he is in a good place and he is the man to beat.\" John Parrott, the 1991 world champion, speaking on BBC Two, added: \"There should be a sign in the foyer which should say 'Quiet please, genius at work'. \"We use the word 'genius' in sport with people like Lionel Messi and players like Tiger Woods in his pomp. This boy is in that [bracket]. It's been over an extended period as well, and when he plays the cue ball sings. \"O'Sullivan seems in a very good place. He was born to play snooker, and when he's out there he's at peace with it.\" Ruthless O'Sullivan cruises into Crucible last 16 Watch: World Snooker Championship - Trump leads Zhou, Selby v Woollaston World Championship: Schedule, results & BBC coverage",

    "article_text": "Emma Raducanu was playing her first WTA match for almost a month Emma Raducanu's return to the WTA Tour began with a hard-fought win over Dutch opponent Suzan Lamens in the Madrid Open first round. The British number two, playing competitively for the first time in almost a month, ground out a 7-6 (7-4) 6-4 victory on the outdoor clay. Raducanu trailed by a break in each set before instantly recovering and edged the bigger points to secure victory. It was her first win on outdoor clay in almost three years. \"I'm pleased with how I just got on with it and didn't try to make too many excuses or complain too much - to myself or to my box,\" Raducanu told BBC Sport. \"It was just accepting it was a challenge. I don't necessarily feel so comfortable on this surface but it is a surface I can get better on.\" Boulter breaks new ground with first WTA clay win Raducanu happy with 'informal' coaching set-up Raducanu took a \"physical and mental\" break from competitive action after reaching the Miami Open quarter-finals last month, instead opting for a 10-day training block in Los Angeles. The world number 49 spent the time there working with Mark Petchey, who is coaching her on an informal basis and was watching as she beat Lamens in her first clay-court appearance of the season. Raducanu, 22, will play Ukrainian 24th seed Marta Kostyuk in the second round. There were mixed fortunes for the other two Britons playing their first-round matches on Wednesday. British number three Sonay Kartal is through with a 6-2 7-5 win over Romania's Jaqueline Cristian, but Francesca Jones is out after losing 7-6 4-6 6-3 to Dayana Yastremska of Ukraine. The Madrid Open is a WTA 1000 event - the rung of tournaments below the Grand Slams - and one of the most important in the build-up to next month's French Open. During her Miami run, Raducanu spoke regularly about showing \"resilience\" to win matches and needed to demonstrate that quality again in her first clay-court match in a year. Lamens, ranked 73rd in the world, is a combative player who has improved sharply over the past year and is more than comfortable on the surface. Earlier this month, she beat British number one Katie Boulter in the Billie Jean King Cup tie that Raducanu missed to \"rest\" her body after a packed start to the season. Raducanu was often unable to cope with Lamens' thumping forehand in the opening set but recovered from a break down - and saved three more break points in the ninth game - to drag her opponent into a tie-break. Another measure of the 2021 US Open champion's improved mentality has been her impressive recent record in these situations - and showed it again. Petchey was sat in her box alongside Raducanu's long-time ally Jane O'Donoghue, regularly offering praise and encouragement at crucial junctures. Raducanu played more aggressively in the second set but also had to dig deep as Lamens tried to pin her back behind the baseline. There were flashes of brilliance from the Briton, too, after she had adjusted to the fast clay conditions created by Madrid's altitude. A running forehand down the line and another thunderous winner piled on the pressure as Lamens failed to hold serve in a lengthy seventh game. However, it was not a straightforward path to victory. Raducanu shakily lost serve for 4-4 before a frustrated Lamens wobbled again and allowed the Briton to secure another confidence-boosting victory. \"I needed to fight and pull through some really difficult moments,\" Raducanu added. \"When your opponent is hitting great shots it is easy to get frustrated and think 'oh my God, they've hit the line so many times'. \"But I had to reset and accept that she's good, here for a reason and playing amazing tennis.\" Live scores, results and order of play Get tennis news sent straight to your phone",

    "title": "Colombian ex-minister accuses the country’s president of drug abuse",
    "article_text": "A prominentColombianpolitician and former minister has accused the country’s president, Gustavo Petro, of being a drug addict who allegedly went awol during an official visit to France. In a damning letter to the South American leader, the former foreign minister Álvaro Leyva painted a dire picture of his one-time boss and ally, later publishing the text on his official X account. When he joined Petro’s cabinet, shortly after his historic 2022 election, Leyva recalled having high hopes for his administration believing Colombia’s first leftwing president could become a “regional leader and global hope”. However, Leyva said he had subsequently witnessed scenes that had caused him “unease and bewilderment”, citing the president’s supposedly poor punctuality, incoherent statements and the pointless trips he allegedly made. Most sensationally, the ex-minister claimed he had witnessed unspecified “embarrassing moments” involving Petro such as when – during a 2023 trip to France – Colombia’s president allegedly “disappeared” for two days. “It was in Paris that I was able to confirm that you had a drug addiction problem … Your recovery, sadly, has not taken place,” wrote Leyva, who was once close to Colombia’s leftist leader despite being of the right and served under him for nearly two years. Petro, who has denied such claims in the past, hit back at his former ally on social media, although he stopped short of denying the accusation. Writing on X, where he is known for his lengthy and sometimes late-night posts, Petro criticized the press and said he had better things to do than spend time with his foreign minister while visiting the French capital. “Isn’t Paris full of parks, museums, bookstores, more interesting than the letter’s writer, to spend two days in? Almost everything in Paris is more interesting. Don’t I have daughters and granddaughters in Paris who are far more interesting than the writer?” Petro wrote. Leyva’s letter sparked a political firestorm in Colombia, with newspapers stamping his claims across their homepages. Writing in El Tiempo, the journalist Juan Sebastián Lombo Delgado, said that never before in recent Colombian history had a key ex-member of the government publicly questioned “the faculties” of his former boss. Congresswoman Katherine Miranda told the same newspaper the “grave” accusations would be irrelevant “if we were talking about any old person – but we are talking about the head of state”. In 2023, after similar allegations from a Colombian journalist, Colombia’s president responded: “The only thing I am addicted to is a morning coffee.” Earlier this year Petro claimed cocaine – a drug Colombia produces more of than any other country – was “no worse than whiskey” and was only illegal because it was made in Latin America. Cocaine production has soared since he took office nearly three years ago. According to the UN office on drugs and crime there wasa 53% potential increasein cocaine production during 2022, with production reaching 2,664 metric tons. The claims came as Petro again locked horns with Donald Trump, with whom he had avery public falling out earlier this year over deportation flights. The row between Petro and Trump began at 3.41am local time in Colombia, on 26 January, when the former took to X to condemn the US’s treatment of Colombian migrants and announce he would not allow US planes to land in his country. Trump responded swiftly and ferociously, threatening visa restrictions and tariffs unless Petro backed down, which he quickly did. On Tuesday, Petro said he believed the US had now “taken away” his visa and claimed he could no longer travel there. “I’ve already seen Donald Duck numerous times so I’ll go see other things,” he added sarcastically.",

    "article_text": "The families of prisoners being held by the authoritarian governments ofEl SalvadorandVenezuelahave condemned President Nayib Bukele’soffer to swap 252 Venezuelan detainees sent to his jailsby theTrump administrationfor the same number of political prisoners incarcerated byNicolás Maduro’s regime. Nelson Suárez, whose brother was among the Venezuelan immigrants sent from the US to a notorious maximum-security jail inEl Salvadorlast month, said he was desperate for the release of his brother, from whom he has heard nothing in five weeks. But Suárez voiced outrage that his sibling – a 33-year-old musician who uses the stage nameSuarezVzla– had become a bargaining chip in a political game. “I feel they are treating my brother like merchandise … like political merchandise,” said Suárez. Sebastián García Casique, whose 24-year-old brother Franciscowas also sent to the prison in El Salvador, also condemned the proposed trade. “Why are you using human beings in a negotiation as if they were toys?” he asked Bukele in a post on Instagram. Relatives of the estimated 900 political prisoners who are incarcerated inVenezuelaalso questioned Bukele’s controversial offer, which the rightwing populist made on Sunday on the social network X, where he has more than 7.5 million followers. In an open letter, the Committee for the Freedom of Political Prisoners in Venezuela said it wanted both political prisoners in Venezuela and innocent immigrants jailed in El Salvador to be freed. But the group said it did not support the “exploitation of the pain of victims for propaganda purposes in an effort to cover up injustices being committed against innocent Venezuelans, either inside or outside of the country”. The committee opposed those incarcerated being “played with” or “used as a political resource to make invisible the inhumane conditions” in which prisoners were being detained in both countries. Bukele repeated his offer on Tuesday after Maduro’s administration rejected what it called his “cynical” gambit, with Venezuela’s top prosecutorcallingEl Salvador’s president a “tyrannical” human trafficker. Scores of Venezuelan immigrants have been deported to El Salvador since mid-March without due process, withDonald Trump’s officials accusing them of being dangerous terrorists and gang members. However, the administration has produced little evidence for those claims and many of the detainees – who were at least initially held in a maximum-security prison called the Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot) –appear to have no criminal background. Their relatives insist they are innocent. “First they were supposedly alleged terrorists – and now they are no longer terrorists, they’re part of a political exchange,” complained Suárez, who believed the Venezuelan migrants were being treated by Bukele “as if they were animals”. Adelys Ferro, a Florida-based Venezuelan American activist who runs an advocacy group called the Venezuelan-American Caucus, said she also wanted freedom for both Venezuela’s political prisoners and the innocent immigrants being held in El Salvador. Ferro slammed Bukele’s “painful and disgusting” political stunt. “What he’s trying to do – to negotiate innocent Venezuelans back and forth with the Maduro dictatorship – is despicable,” Ferro said. “We cannot celebrate two authoritarians negotiating back and forth with Venezuelan lives.”",

    "title": "Stock markets rise as Trump backtracks on high China tariffs and firing Fed chair",
    "article_text": "Stock markets have risen around the world afterDonald Trumpsaid his tariffs on China would come down “substantially” and he had “no intention” of firing the chair of the US central bank, Jerome Powell. Weeks of tough talk on trade from White House officials have rattled investors and Trump now appears to be softening his tone. The president told reporters in Washington on Tuesday heplanned to be “very nice” to Chinain trade talks and that tariffs could drop in both countries if they could reach a deal, adding: “It will come down substantially, but it won’t be zero.” Overnight in Asia, Japan’s Nikkei rose by nearly 2%, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was up 2.4% and the South Korean Kospi gained 1.6%. The rally spread to Europe in early trading on Wednesday, with the UK’s FTSE 100 index up 1.6%, while the Italian FTSE MIB rose by 1.1%. Germany’s Dax gained 2.6% and France’s Cac 2.1%. Meanwhile, US stocks opened on a high Wednesday morning, with the Dow rallying over 800 points, and the Nasdaq Composite up over 3%. The rally stalled in the afternoon but all the major stock markets managed to end the day higher. On Wednesday, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, also took a softer, optimistic tone onChinain remarks delivered at the Institute of International Finance in Washington DC, saying that China “knows it needs to change”. “If China is serious on less dependence on export-led manufacturing growth and rebalancing toward a domestic economy … let’s rebalance together,” Bessent said. “This is an incredible opportunity.” Bessenttoldinvestors in a private meeting on Tuesday that he expects a “de-escalation” of the trade war between China and the US in the “very near future”. “‘America First’ does not mean America alone. To the contrary, it is a call for deeper collaboration and mutual respect among trade partners,” Bessent said on Wednesday. Investor confidence also grew after Trump told reporters he would not fire Powell, the chair of the US Federal Reserve, reversing the previous day’s losses triggered by the presidentcalling the central bank boss a “major loser”. The president has criticised the Fed chair repeatedly for refusing to cut interest rates and last week hinted that hebelieved he could dismiss Powellbefore his term as the head of the central bank comes to an end in May next year. Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social, last week that Powell’s termination “could not come fast enough”, after the Fed chair raised concerns about the impact of trade tariffs on the American economy. However, the suggestion from the White House that the US central bank will remain independent helped stocks to rise on Wednesday, as well as the prospect of lower tariffs on Chinese imports to the US. The US dollar, which hit a three-year low on Tuesday before recovering, rose by 0.25% against a basket of major currencies. Oil prices also rose on Wednesday, with Brent crude rising above $68 (£51) a barrel amid hopes that lower tariffs will be less damaging to the global economy. The rise was also led by new US sanctions targeting Iranian liquefied petroleum gas and the crude oil shipping magnate Seyed Asadoollah Emamjomeh. Meanwhile, gold, which is traditionally viewed by investors as a safe haven asset during volatile periods, retreated from thenew high of $3,500 (£2,620) an ounceit hit on Tuesday, to trade at about $3,307.",

    "title": "Indonesian ambassador met senior Australian diplomats on same day Albanese accused Dutton of ‘damaging relationship’",
    "article_text": "Indonesia’s ambassador met with senior Australian diplomats on Tuesday as the nation was thrust into an election campaign debate about a potential Russian military presence in the region – and on the same day Anthony Albanese accused Peter Dutton of damaging the bilateral relationship. Indonesia’s ambassador to Australia, Dr Siswo Pramono, met with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s deputy secretary, Michelle Chan, who leads its south-east Asian policy division. One diplomatic source said Indonesia requested the meeting. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter The meeting has been described by multiple sources as part of a regular series of engagements between Pramono and Chan, who is also responsible for managing the department’s diplomatic relationship with Indonesia. Neither Pramono or the department would comment on the issues discussed at the meeting, with a Dfat spokesperson stating it was “not appropriate to comment on private conversations” in accordance with “longstanding diplomatic practice”. But Hervé Lemahieu, the research director at foreign policy thinktank the Lowy Institute, said “it would be more surprising to me ifRussiawasn’t raised in discussion than if it was”. “Given the caretaker period, Dfat would be mindful of not damaging the relationship in any way and I see it in that context,” Lemahieu said. A diplomatic source said the meeting was not called to specifically discuss Russia’s reported proposal to base military aircraft in a remote corner of eastern Indonesia, but confirmed the exchange could have extended beyond the formal discussion plan. Indonesia has featured in the federal election campaign ever since aUS military publication, Janes, reported that Jakartahad received an official request from Moscow seeking permission for its military aircraft to be based at Manuhua air force base in the province of Papua. The story cited Indonesian government sources. Tuesday’s meeting, which took place less than two weeks before an election, followed an Australian government request for more information about the Russian proposal and the Indonesian response, including from the foreign and defence ministers. It is not known when the Indonesians requested the meeting. Canberra made urgent calls to Jakarta after the story’s publication earlier this month. Within hours, Richard Marles said in a statement that he had discussed the report with Indonesia’s defence minister, Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin. “[He] said to me in the clearest possible terms, reports of the prospect of Russian aircraft operating from Indonesia are simply not true,” Marles said. Last week an Indonesian foreign ministry spokesperson, Rolliansyah Soemirat, said the government had not granted permission to any country to establish a military base on its territory, but his statement did not mention if Russia had made a request. Sign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025 Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion The story continued to be a political issue when Dutton wrongly told a press conference that Indonesia’s president, Prabowo Subianto, had announced the Russian proposal. During the second leaders’ debate hosted by the ABC,he admitted this was a mistake. “The reference I was making should not have been to the president, it was in relation to sources from the Prabowo government,” Dutton said. “It was a mistake and I am happy to admit [that].” By then, Albanese had already accused Dutton of “verballing” the Indonesian president and accused him of “extraordinary overreach” before the facts were clear. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, had described Dutton’s comments as reckless and accused him of “fabricating” a statement. During the third leaders’ debateon Tuesday, Albanese accused Dutton of “damaging” a “really important relationship” with his comments. Later in the debate, Dutton referenced his relationship with Prabowo while responding to questions about his ability to manage Australia’s relationship with key allies. “I met the current president of Indonesia when he was defence minister,” Dutton said. “I had a meeting with him in Canberra when he was the president-elect.”",

    "title": "Exclusion zones: is Peter Dutton’s campaign avoiding proposed nuclear power sites?",
    "article_text": "Peter Dutton is avoiding visiting any of the seven sites for his proposed nuclear reactors, Anthony Albanese and the Labor party claim, arguing the issue has become “radioactive” for the Coalition. The Liberal leader says he is still committed to nuclear power, even as he concedes it may not be “politically popular”. Asked earlier this month about visiting communities near the proposed sites on the campaign, Dutton said he had been to some in recent years, but would not “be able to get to all of them”. But is he actually avoiding the towns near where he wants to build nuclear reactors? Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter Labor has long ridiculed the Coalition’s plan for the commonwealth to underwrite the constructionof seven plants on the sites of decommissioned coal stations. Journalists tailing Dutton on the campaign trail have repeatedly questioned why no planned nuclear site has featured in Dutton’s dozens of photo ops and press conferences since the official campaign began. DuringTuesday night’s debate, Albanese claimed Dutton “won’t go anywhere near [the proposed station sites] … because he knows that [the policy] just doesn’t stack up”. On Wednesday, the prime minister visited the Collie power station, about a 20km drive from another of the proposed sites, Muja power station. Both are due to be decommissioned in coming years; the Western Australian state Labor government is pouring hundreds of millions into the town of Collie to support renewable energy projects in the area. “You would think that there was radiation coming from these sites,” Albanese said, referencing Dutton’s absence, “because he just won’t come and won’t talk about what his plans actually are.” The energy minister, Chris Bowen, joked that nuclear power was “the dark lord of policies, the Voldemort, the policy whose name cannot be mentioned by [the Coalition]”. “Peter Dutton has not been within 50km of one of his proposed nuclear reactors in this election campaign,” Bowen claimed. The education minister, Jason Clare, gave a similar line on Wednesday, claiming: “The earthquake in the Hunter this morningwas closer to the site of one of these nuclear reactors than Peter Dutton has even been to them.” The Coalition’s plan is to build nuclear reactors at seven sites: Tarong and Callide in Queensland; Mount Piper and Liddell in New South Wales; Collie/Muja in Western Australia; Loy Yang in Victoria; and Port Augusta in South Australia. Asked at a Perth press conference on 3 April if he would visit Collie during the campaign, Dutton said: “I’ve been to Collie before. There are seven locations around the country and I won’t be able to get to all of them.” In East Maitland on 17 April, in the electorate of Paterson – around an hour’s drive from the proposed plant in the Hunter region – Dutton was asked why he had not visited that site. “I’m not going to be able to meet every Australian. I’ve had the great honour of meeting many around the country,” he answered. Dutton has claimed that “people in regions, including in the Hunter” have been receptive to nuclear power because of the energy-intensive requirements for manufacturing and steel production – and praised residents in those areas as having a higher “energy IQ”. Dutton had previouslypledged to override local opposition to nuclear power, if necessary; inlast week’s ABC debate, Dutton said he would seek local “consensus” – but if that proved impossible “then we’ll do what’s in our country’s best interests”. Sign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025 Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Analysis of Dutton’s campaign visits as of Wednesday shows he has not yet visited any of those towns. It appears the closest he has been to any of the stations was when visiting a trade college in Maitland, which is around 70km from the Liddell site by road. Also in the Hunter, Dutton previously visited a Tomago workshop, 85km from Liddell by road. He also made a brief stop in Busselton, for a quick press conference at the local airport on a trip from Perth to the east coast – around a 120km drive from the Collie/Muja site. Dutton had a scheduled campaign stop in Orange, around 100km from the Mount Piper site, on Tuesday which was cancelled after the death of Pope Francis. On Wednesday, at a Perth press conference, Dutton dismissed any suggestion he had been avoiding the sites. The opposition leader said he’d “been to Bunbury and to the Hunter. I have been to both of those communities.” The coastal city of Bunbury, two hours south of Perth, is around 50km away from Collie, but Dutton has not visited during the official campaign. Dutton doubled down on his criticisms against Labor, claiming the government had not engaged “legitimately” with Hunter region residents about their plans for offshore wind. Asked if he was himself avoiding community engagement with towns affected by his nuclear policy, Dutton replied “no”, before suggesting he had been to the Hunter “more than once”. “We’ve made our decision, and we’re happy to consult with people in government,” Dutton said. The opposition leader on Wednesday stressed: “We are committed to nuclear, not because it’s politically popular.” “I haven’t committed to nuclear energy for votes. I committed to it because it’s in the best interest of our country,” he said. “We can’t pretend that, as the prime minister and Chris Bowen keep talking about, that wind is free and solar is free. If that were the case, why have your power bills gone up by $1,300 instead of down by $275? So, we are committed to it.”",

    "title": "Giant prehistoric kangaroos preferred to ‘chill at home’ and didn’t like to go out much, scientists say",
    "article_text": "Despite their immense size, species of prehistoric giant kangaroos from a site in Queensland were probably homebodies with a surprisingly small range compared with other kangaroos, according to new Australian research. Protemnodon, which lived on the Australian continent between 5m and 40,000 years ago, was significantly larger than its modern relatives.Some species weighed up to 170kg, making them more than twice as heavy as the largest red kangaroo. Given their size, researchers expected they might have an expansive territory, said University of Wollongong palaeo-ecologist Chris Laurikainen Gaete, the co-author of the studypublished in Plos One. That’s because in most modern plant-eating mammals, including kangaroos and other macropods, larger body size correlated with geographic range, he said. A small marsupial such as the pademelon, for example, occupies an area smaller than a kilometre squared, whereas the red kangaroo – the largest of all kinds – in outback Australia can hop long distances, sometimes further than 20km. But analysis of fossil teeth found near Mt Etna, 30km north of Rockhampton in Queensland, revealed something quite different. These protemnodon kept to close quarters, living and dying near the caves where their remains were found. Co-author Dr Scott Hocknull, a vertebrate palaeontologist and senior curator at the Queensland Museum, said the individuals from Mt Etna seemed to be “real homebodies” that stayed within “a tiny pocket” in and around the limestone caves. “These gigantic kangaroos were just chilling at home, eating the rainforest leaves, because there were heaps of them around. That also means that the environment was quite stable. It meant that over hundreds of thousands of years, these animals decided that staying put was a good bet.” Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter The population at Mt Etna was “probably quite happy” for some time, Hocknull said. The rainforest probably provided a reliable source of food, while the caves offered protection from prehistoric predators, such as marsupial lions. But their restricted range was a “bad bet” in the end, Hocknull said, because it predisposed them to a risk of extinction when a changing climate and increasing aridity disrupted the rainforest environment about 280,000 years ago. Dr Isaac Kerr, who specialises in kangaroo palaeontology at Flinders University and was not involved with the study, said protemnodon fossils – found mainly in the south and east of the country – indicated there wereseveral speciesadapted to different environments. “Probably they were all over the whole continent, including New Guinea,” he said. A site in Tasmania had one of the latest surviving species, dated to 41,000 years ago. Sign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025 Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Kerr said these megafauna kangaroosranged in sizebut were generally stockier than their modern counterparts, with shorter feet. Protemnodon probably looked something like a wallaroo, he said, “squat and muscular but still quite large compared to a modern kangaroo”. Mt Etna is one of Australia’s richest fossil sites, containing evidence of ancient Pleistocene rainforests andrecords covering periodsof past environmental change when rainforests gave way to open, arid environments. The researchers’ next step was to apply similar techniques to fossils of smaller kangaroos such as tree kangaroos, pademelons and rock wallabies from Mt Etna, which still have living descendants, to understand how they survived the environmental changes while protemnodon died out. The study compared the unique chemical signatures found in the local geology with those found in the fossilised teeth to establish the range of each animal, Gaete said. “Strontium is an element that varies in the environment, specifically in underlying bedrocks – so a limestone will have a significantly different strontium signature compared to something like volcanic rock or basalt,” he said. These unique signatures made their way into soil and plants, and were reflected in the fossilised teeth of herbivores that ate those plants. Laurikainen Gaete said the technique could be used to understand, on a site-by-site basis, why certain species of megafauna disappeared from particular places. Hocknull said: “It fundamentally shifts how palaeontologists and ecologists look at the fossil record.”",

    "article_text": "A majority of Australians do not view nuclear power favourably, and would be concerned if a plant was built near them, according to anew surveyshared exclusively with Guardian Australia. The new figures come as the Coalition battles toregain momentumin the final two weeks of the election campaign. The Coalition haspledgedto build taxpayer-funded nuclear reactors at seven sites around Australia in a bid for more “reliable” power than could be achieved with renewables firmed by storage such as batteries and pumped-hydro, using gas as a back-up. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter The Coalition has promised a two-and-a-half-year consultation process, but some Nationals constituentshave saidtheir concerns are already being ignored and some community groupshave expressed angerthat they will not be able to veto plants in their area. The new survey suggests concern about nuclear power plants being built nearby is widespread. Almost 10% were concerned when asked about the prospect of a nuclear plant being built within 50km of their homes, while 16% were very concerned and 38.8% were extremely concerned. By comparison, about 80% viewed wind and solar power favourably and the majority surveyed would not be concerned if solar or windfarms were built nearby. The previously unpublished data was collected in December and comes from theNational Climate Action Survey, conducted annually by researchers at Griffith University since 2021. The survey asks more than 300 questions, such as where people get information about climate change from, whether they have been affected by natural disasters and what changes they’d be prepared to make to their behaviour. The aim of the survey, according to associate professor Kerrie Foxwell-Norton, is to measure “the ways in which Australians are thinking about climate change and [climate] action”. “You can see in the way that stats play out, that there’s a lot of concern around the development of a coalmine, gas site, and a nuclear power plant, as opposed to renewable sources of power,” says Foxwell-Norton. “So people are aware of the local environmental outcomes for the development of fossil fuel energy sources as opposed to renewables.” Sign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025 Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion In the latest survey, 84% of Australians believe the world’s climate is changing and 75% are somewhat or very worried about global warming. Foxwell-Norton says the trust in climate science has been pretty steady across the surveys. This trust seems to cut across the political spectrum. 98% of Greens voters believe the science, as do 92% of Labor voters, 80% of Nationals, 73% of Liberal party supporters and 52% of both One Nation and United Australia supporters. “The survey shows that the baseline of trust in scientific expertise is established in Australia. But after that, things get really complicated in terms of how Australians are responding in regional areas as opposed to metropolitan and remote areas. How people are responding based on their socioeconomic class, upon their age, their gender and so on. “And that sort of complexity is not something to be smoothed away if we are going to seek meaningful action on climate, then we need to dig down into the complexity.”",

    "article_text": "The Australian Labor party has outspent the Coalition on television advertising this election, but Clive Palmer’sTrumpet of Patriotshas spent more than everyone on YouTube, where he has forked out more than $4m. Labor’s total outlay on free-to-air and subscription television spots is $5.8m, compared with the Coalition’s $4.2m. However, Trumpet of Patriots is not far behind the ALP, spending $5.6m on traditional TV ads. OnYouTube, a platform where there is 40% more political advertising than there was at the last federal election, Palmer is taking a blunt force approach, according to video ad measurement company Adgile. Labor, the Liberals and the Greens have embraced YouTube’s ability to home in on a specific audience based on demographics and locations, but Palmer is buying to reach broad audiences. “This time round we are seeing a four-way battle between Labor, Liberals, Greens and Trumpet of Patriots for dominance on the platform,” Adgile’s managing director, Shaun Lohman, said. The relatively low cost of YouTube ads means the parties have been able to diversify their messages, with Labor so far making 266 different YouTube ads and the Liberals 251. “At present, Labor is outspending the Coalition in total, but the Coalition is spending more on YouTube, and it’s entirely possible that they may be holding back money for the final week of the campaign,” Lohman said. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter On Facebook and Instagram, Labor is also ahead, so far spending almost $700,000 since the election was called. This is almost double the $385,266 spent by the Liberal party, which also allocated $127,085 to itsTeals Revealedcampaign on social media. Across Meta, Climate 200, which backs some Teal candidates, has spent $430,869 and the Jacqui Lambi Network has spent $94,426. Spending on YouTube by political parties rose significantly during the early weeks of the campaign, potentially reflecting the platform’s capacity to be used for tactical seat-by-seat messaging. “This election has seen a twenty-fold increase in political advertising spend on YouTube compared with the last federal election,” Lohman said. On YouTube, as of the start of this week, the Coalition was behind Trumpet of Patriots’ spend ($4.2m) on $2.3m, but ahead of the ALP’s $2m. Sign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025 Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion “The parties are really homing in on digital video’s ability to geo-target and send different messages to voters in different electorates, with digital video currently enjoying around 40% of the TV budget,” Lohman said. Traditional free-to-air and subscription TV and radio services have to follow blackout rules in the period immediately leading up to an election or referendum – this year, from midnight on Thursday 1 May until 6pm on 3 May, when the polls close. However, noted Lohman, with online channels not bound by the same rules, “it’s quite possible this election will see more political advertising dollars spent online than on TV”. On TikTok, the prime minister was leading the pack in audience engagement. According to influencer marketing platform Fabulate, Albanese’s (@albomp) account was attracting six times the likes and comments of opposition leader, Peter Dutton (@peter.duttonmp), and nine times more than Greens leader Adam Bandt (@adambandt) – and posting more frequently. The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, does not have a TikTok account. “Clearly, the Albanese team have learned a lesson or two about TikTok,” Fabulate’s strategy officer, Nathan Powell, said. “[They] are following best practice on the platform, which is posting consistency and having clear content pillars to message to your audience.”",

    "title": "US peace plan emerges as freezing of Ukraine frontlines with concessions to Putin",
    "article_text": "The contours of the White House’s “final” peace proposal to halt the Russian invasion ofUkrainehave come into focus with proposals to freeze the frontlines in exchange for terms that critics have termed a surrender to Russian interests in the the three-year-old conflict. Three people with knowledge of the talks told the Guardian that Vladimir Putin had signalled a readiness to effectively freeze the frontlines of the conflict in exchange for numerous concessions, including US recognition of Russian control of Crimea and considerable US sanctions relief. The Financial Timesfirst reported Putin’s proposalon Tuesday. The vice-president,JD Vance, confirmed on Wednesday that the US would seek to “freeze the territorial lines at some level close to where they are today”. Some territory could change hands, he said. “The current lines, or somewhere close to them, is where you’re ultimately … going to draw the new lines in the conflict,” he said. “Now, of course, that means the Ukrainians and the Russians are both going to have to give up some of the territory they currently own.” But reports of the US proposal do not include other Kremlin demands, including a limit on the future size of the Ukrainian military or a ban on foreign troops in the country. Russia had listed concerns over Ukraine’s military and foreign backing as among its “root causes” for launching its 2022 full-scale invasion. A draft version of the White House proposal seen by Axios reported that Russia would receive de jure recognition of Moscow’s control of Crimea, de facto recognition of Russia’s occupation of much of eastern Ukraine, and a promise that Ukraine would not become a member of Nato (although it could join the EU). Russia could also receive sanctions relief for its energy sector, enabling the Kremlin to increase vital revenue flows that have been impeded since the invasion. Ukraine, in turn, would receive a “robust security guarantee” from an ad hoc group of European nations, although the draft did not describe how a peacekeeping force would operate or whether the US would take part. Ukraine would also be promised unimpeded passage on the Dnipro River and some territory in the Kharkiv region, along with vaguely defined pledges for future financial support for rebuilding. Senior Russian officials have said Moscow will not take part in talks that include discussions of a European peacekeeping force in Ukraine. “Russia is still against [the presence of European peacekeepers],” the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters on Wednesday. “That would be de facto Nato forces and resources on the territory of Ukraine. It was one of the main reasons for the start of the special military operation.” The US decision to recognise Crimea would be politically contentious in Ukraine and would mark a turning point in US postwar policy, with the White House effectively endorsing a Russian effort to redraw the borders of Europe by force. The Ukrainian leader,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said this week that Ukraine “will not legally recognise the occupation of Crimea … There’s nothing to talk about here. This is against our constitution.” Donald Trump reacted angrily to Zelenskyy’s remarks on Wednesday, calling them “very harmful to the Peace Negotiations with Russia”. “Nobody is asking Zelenskyy to recognize Crimea as Russian Territory but, if he wants Crimea, why didn’t they fight for it eleven years ago when it was handed over to Russia without a shot being fired?” he wrote. “The situation for Ukraine is dire,” he said. Zelenskyy “can have peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole country”. Moscow also appears to be eyeing the deal favourably. “There is a chance to make a deal,” said one source close to the Kremlin. “But they could also miss that chance.” A draft of the plan seen by Axios, as well as the Telegraph, said that Ukraine would retain control over the Zaporizhzhia power plant but it would be managed by the US, which would supply electricity to both Ukraine and Russia.",

    "article_text": "Keir Starmer is under pressure from more than 60 Labour MPs to allow thousands of young Europeans to live and work in the UK, a move seen as key to unlocking a more ambitious trade reset with Brussels. The chancellor,Rachel Reeves, said discussions on a potential scheme were ongoing, in the clearest hint yet that the government is preparing to do a deal. A youth mobility scheme that would allow British and European 18- to 30-year-olds to travel freely has been seen as akey European demandin reaching an economic deal with the UK. Sources suggested the EU would now be open to putting a quota and time limit on such visas, opening the door for an agreement. In a letter to Nick Thomas-Symonds, the minister negotiating with Brussels, 70LabourMPs and peers said a time-limited, capped youth visa scheme should be agreed and trade cooperation deepened beyond the government’s current ambitions. The intervention comes before a crucial few weeks for the UK’s relationship with the EU. Starmer is due to meet the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, in London on Thursday as momentum builds towards a UK-EU summit in May. Cabinet differences remain on the shape a youth visa deal could take. Reeves is said to be in favour of a deal that includes time-limited youth visas – the highest priority for Brussels – but the home secretary,Yvette Cooper, has insisted on a cap on numbers, with a time limit of one year. One source with knowledge of the talks said the cap would probably be about 70,000 people. “Yvette is pursuing the task she has been set by the PM – to reduce net migration,” a source close to the home secretary said. Asked in Washington on Wednesday about the possibility of a youth mobility scheme, Reeves said: “We want to see net migration fall as a government and we’ve set out plans to achieve that. We also want to have control of who comes into this country. That is really important for us. “But we’re not going to be returning to free movement. We will bring down net migration, and the talks are ongoing with the EU around reducing trade barriers.” One EU source said: “Everyone is being cautious but there is a desire to find a way that removes any suggestion that this is going to increase migration. It could come in many forms and quotas is just one.” In their letter to the minister, 62 MPs led by the Welwyn Hatfield MP, Andrew Lewin, said the government should work with the EU to create new opportunities for British young people to work and travel in the EU, similar to agreements with more than a dozen countries including Australia and Canada. “We want to see a new and bespoke youth visa scheme for UK and EU citizens aged under 30. As with all of the UK’s existing schemes, we believe this should be time-limited and subject to a cap on numbers,” the MPs said. It is understood the UK is on the verge of agreeing to enter into negotiations on three key topics including the youth mobility scheme, a sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) deal to eliminate checks on food and drink being exported to the EU and entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain, and a deal on carbon emissions. It is thought the SPS deal would be based on a deal the EU struck with Switzerland in 2023, but with substantial changes. “The EU hates the Swiss mode. It is full of complexity and inefficiency but that is not to say it could not be a conceptual model to build on,” an EU source said. A defence pact is almost certain after the EU’s white paper on defence in March paved the way for British defence companies such as Babcock and BAE Systems to bid for money from the new €150bn (£129bn)EU defence fund. UK and European sources also expect an announcement on trafficking and intelligence sharing as a way of signalling a tough approach to irregular migration. Full negotiations are expected to be given the go-ahead to start by the autumn, once the European Commission has a mandate from member states. The MPs’ intervention has been privately welcomed by some ministers as a tacit signal of the outline of what the government is seeking to achieve. In their letter to Thomas-Symonds, the MPs say the UK should seek to allow products to be tested in the UK to reduce cost and complexity for UK and EU firms. Sign up toHeadlines UK Get the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion The letter suggests furtherBrexittrade barriers could be removed through a Canada-style deal involving a mutual recognition agreement (MRA) on conformity assessment, allowing standards of goods to be tested in the UK before export. That change has been strongly backed by UK business groups but previously resisted by the EU over fears that the EU’s testing capabilities would be offshored in the UK. But negotiations may be possible for specific sectors, such as pharmaceuticals. MPs also said the government should seek to join the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean (PEM) convention, a customs union alternative that would lift barriers particularly for the automotive, chemicals and pharmaceutical sectors. “As certainties about globalisation, trade and tariffs break down at a remarkable speed, we are reminded how our stability, prosperity and security depend on having deep and resilient partnerships with like-minded nations, based on free and frictionless trade, shared values and political trust,” the letter says. Lewin told the Guardian that Starmer should be confident he had support and a mandate for a more ambitious settlement. “This is a moment of opportunity for all who want to see a closer relationship between the UK and the EU, and that includes millions of voters who put their confidence in Labour last year,” said Lewin, who won his seat from the former defence secretary Grant Shapps. The letter has been signed by dozens from the new intake of MPs, including those with constituencies that voted to leave the EU. They include Amanda Hack, who won Andrew Bridgen’s former seat in North West Leicestershire, Mike Tapp, the Dover and Deal MP, and the prominent new backbenchers Yuan Yang, Emily Darlington, Joe Powell, Josh Dean, Simon Opher and Tom Rutland. Phil Brickell, who also signed the letter, said: “This isn’t about relitigating the Brexit years. Rather, it’s about ensuring businesses such as those in my Bolton West constituency can access the European markets fenced off from them by the Tory-botched Brexit deal.” Experts said even the push from Labour MPs would be unlikely to address the hit to UK economic growth caused by Brexit. “I think they are in a race against time to tie down whatever they want to do with the US before they do a deal with the EU. It is a two-headed monster,” said Mij Rahman, the head for Europe at the Eurasia Group consultancy. David Henig, a trade expert, said the deal was unlikely to deliver the economic growth Labour is seeking. “Perhaps it can best be seen as a reasonable first step that should be accompanied by a plan to go further within respective red lines,” he said. Stella Creasy, the chair of the Labour Movement for Europe, said the government’s ambitions should go even further than the letter suggested. “We have to be ruthless about reducing the barriers to trade with Europe that the Tory Brexit deal created, whether they are the paperwork created by VAT, emissions trading schemes that affect energy costs or the extra headaches caused by new regulations,” the MP for Walthamstow said.",

    "title": "Keir Starmer’s realignment with Europe will be a low-key one",
    "article_text": "Talk of veterinary agreements, “Canada-plus” and rules of origin are likely to give even the most hardened Westminster veteran terrifying flashbacks. There was once a time when a word from Tory Eurosceptic Bill Cash on dynamic alignment could splash national newspapers. Now the more common reaction to those terms is a barely stifled yawn. And that is exactly how No 10 would like it to stay. There are those in the Labour party who would like to seeKeir Starmerembrace a more romantic pro-European story, to extol the UK’s European values and solidarity, as a counter to the views of Donald Trump. But that is not this prime minister’s style. So there will be a more ambitious EU reset but in the most low-key way possible. The aim in Downing Street is to Make Brussels Boring Again. It seems fertile ground for the UK to seek closer trade ties with Brussels, and within No 10 there is a will to do it, as long as the words “single market”, “customs union” and “freedom of movement” do not appear anywhere. There are three key reasons why the UK can think bolder. The first is the most obvious: the international turmoil caused by both the US’s wildly wavering support for Ukraine and by Trump’s tariffs has made Brussels a far more willing partner in the coming negotiations. Secondly, the Brexit dinosaurs are mostly gone from the House of Commons. In their place are an army of Labour millennials eager to vote through closer ties withEurope, though there are some who will wobble in their “red wall” seats with Reform snapping at their heels. But Brussels need have no fear – as it once did – about the instability of the UK parliament. And there has been a significant shift in public opinion on Brexit that suggests people are more open to closer ties with Europe. Some of that is simply because of population turnover – according tothe Economist, two-thirds of the people who have died since 2020 supported leaving the EU. But each of these three factors have their downsides. Starmer has to tread carefully as he negotiates to remove US trade barriers. It is debatable whether the UK really received lower tariffs than the EU because of a desire for preferential treatment, but it is still a tightrope to walk with such an unpredictable White House inhabitant. It would be advantageous to do an agreement with the US before a deal with the EU. In parliament, the government is worried that its new Labour MPs will get too excited about Europe and begin to crow publicly about how the reset shows how wrong the Brexiters really were. Any kind of language like that is likely to be stamped on hard. And Starmer may have ejected Jacob Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker from parliament but he has a very effective foe in Nigel Farage. Some in government believe Farage will ultimately show little interest in what the government does on border sanitary checks – perhaps even he is bored of shouting “Brexit betrayal” or realises it is lower salience than immigration or net zero. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion But theyouth visa scheme, which is likely to be agreed as part of the talks, has the potential to spiral. While public support for Brexit may be dropping, polls show the issue is a very low priority for voters, despite what pro-European campaigners would like to think. There could be a major polling backlash if the issue is likely to be seen to dominate the government’s agenda. And the drop in support for leave does not tell the full story. Downing Street sources say from their focus groups that this is not the people who say they regret voting leave. The blame is laid at the feet of the Tories who negotiated the last deal. This is how Starmer will frame his eventual EU reset, fixing the mess of the negotiation he will say was left by Boris Johnson’s government. There will even be language that will infuriate some pro-European MPs, that forging smoother trade with Europe is a “Brexit benefit”, that the UK can be more flexible with its powerful neighbour. But the strategy over the coming weeks and months will be to push for the most ambitious deal possible in the most unromantic terms possible.",

    "title": "Trump accuses Zelenskyy of jeopardising imminent peace deal",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump has accusedVolodymyr Zelenskyyof jeopardising what he claimed was an imminent peace deal to end the war in Ukraine, as he gave the clearest hint yet that the US would be willing to formally recognise Russia’s seizure of Crimea as part of any agreement. The US president claimed a deal to end the war – largely negotiated between Washington and Moscow – was close, while the vice-president,JD Vance, said the agreement would include a proposal to freeze the conflict roughly along the current frontlines. It was unclear howUkraineand its European allies, who were meeting in London on Wednesday, would respond to a plan largely constructed in their absence. Zelenskyy countered by proposing a simple ceasefire without conditions on both sides, though this did not immediately gain any traction from the US. But after a day of speculation and partial disclosure of the terms of the peace proposal, Trump attacked his Ukrainian counterpart for complaining that Kyiv was unwilling to cede Crimea toRussia– the most contentious aspect of the tentative agreement that has leaked so far. The US president wrote on social media that “Crimea was lost years ago” in 2014, when Barack Obama was president, and its control “is not even a point of discussion”, an apparent reference to the fact that Ukraine has been unable to recapture it in the three-year war sparked by Russia’s full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022. Reports that Washington would be willing to recognise Crimea under Russian control have been circulating for a couple of days. That prompted Zelenskyy to say on Tuesday that “Ukraine will not recognise the occupation of Crimea”, arguing that doing so it would be incompatible with the country’s constitution. Responding to a report of his comments, Trump wrote on Wednesday that “this statement is very harmful to the Peace Negotiations with Russia” and accused the Ukrainian leader of making “inflammatory statements” that “makes it so difficult to settle this War”. “Nobody is asking Zelenskyy to recognize Crimea as Russian Territory,” Trump wrote, implying that US was willing to do so, before accusing Ukraine of failing to defend Crimea. “If he wants Crimea, why didn’t they fight for it eleven years ago when it was handed over to Russia without a shot being fired?” Later, Trump said he thought Russia had agreed to a deal to end the conflict in Ukraine, with Zelenskyy now the holdout. “I think we have a deal with Russia. We have to get a deal with Zelenskyy,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “I thought it might be easier to deal with Zelenskyy. So far it’s been harder.” Russia unilaterally annexed Crimea in March 2014 during a political crisis in Ukraine after the ousting of the country’s pro-Russia president, Viktor Yanukovych. Gunmen seized the regional parliament and airports, and in a subsequent referendum 97% voted to join Russia. The poll was not recognised as legal by the US, UK or EU. Matthew Savill, the director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank, said that US recognition of Russia’s control of Crimea would be a “de jure recognition of territory taken by force” and amount to “actively endorsing the Russian position in opposition to the European position and Ukrainian politics”. A Ukraine peace summit in London was hastily downgraded on Wednesday morning after Washington said the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, would not be travelling the evening before. Hosted by the UK foreign secretary,David Lammy, the meeting was said to be taking place at the level of officials instead. Downing Street said it had consisted of substantive technical meetings on how to stop the fighting, with Washington’s Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg; Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, and national security advisers from France and Germany among those present. Vance had earlier called on Ukraine and Russia to accept a US-led peace proposal and threatened that Washington would abandon its effort to end the war – a Trump campaign promise – if it was not accepted. “We’ve issued a very explicit proposal to both the Russians and the Ukrainians, and it’s time for them to either say yes or for the United States to walk away from this process,” Vance said. The US proposal would mean “we’re going to freeze the territorial lines at some level close to where they are today”, Vance said, though he added there should be some adjustments. “Now, of course, that means the Ukrainians and the Russians are both going to have to give up some of the territory they currently own.” A ceasefire on the current frontlines has already been accepted in principle by Ukraine and Zelenskyy called again for an immediate halt to the three-year war. “In Ukraine, we insist on an immediate, full and unconditional ceasefire,” he said, adding that “stopping the killings is the number one task”. Early on Thursday, a missile attack in Kyiv killed at least two people and wounded 54, the capital’s mayor said. Thirty-eight of the injured – including six children – were hospitalised, Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram. Nine people were reportedly killedearly on Wednesday when a Russian drone hit a bus carrying workers in the Ukrainian city of Marhanets – one of 134 large drones that Ukrainian authorities reported had attacked the country overnight. Though Ukraine has indicated it is willing to accept de facto Russian occupation of about a fifth of its territory, arguing that it will reunite the country by diplomatic means eventually, it has refused to accept what would be a domestically unpopular partition by accepting Russia’s formal control of Crimea, even if the recognition came from the US. Other anticipated elements of the deal are that Ukraine would be prevented by a US veto from joining Nato, a point largely accepted by a reluctant Kyiv. Another, that future security guarantees would be provided by a UK and French-led “coalition of the willing” made up of 30 countries, has not been accepted by Russia. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Russia continued to oppose the presence ofEuropean peacekeeping forces, which Ukraine sees as the only viable alternative to Nato membership for ensuring its security. Peskov said there were “many nuances” surrounding negotiations to end the conflict in Ukraine and that the positions of the various parties involved had yet to be brought closer – suggesting, from a Russian perspective, that the deal was not yet agreed. Initial reports on Tuesday had suggested Russia was willing to trade territory it does not control in Ukraine – in effect, fresh air – for a US recognition of its seizure of Crimea, in what would be a formal acknowledgment that it is possible to change borders by force, creating an extraordinary post-second world war precedent. Russia may be banking on the idea that Ukraine is weary after more than three years of war and that its proposal is a reasonable counter to western suggestions, backed by the US, Ukraine and Europe, that there should be an immediate and full ceasefire to allow other wider negotiations to take place.",

    "article_text": "This live blog is now closed. For the latest on Ukraine, read more coveragehere. US president Donald Trump chided Ukrainian leaderVolodymyr Zelenskyyon Wednesday for saying Ukraine would not recognise Russia’s occupation of Crimea, which he called an inflammatory statement that will make a peace deal with Russia harder to achieve. “This statement is very harmful to the Peace Negotiations with Russia,”Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. He said Crimea was lost years ago “and is not even a point of discussion.” “We are very close to a Deal, but the man with ‘no cards to play’ should now, finally, GET IT DONE,” Trump added. “I look forward to being able to helpUkraine, and Russia, get out of this Complete and Total MESS, that would have never started if I were President!” It’s 9.15pm in Moscow and Kyiv. Here’s a recap of the latest developments: US vice-president JD Vance urged Ukraine and Russia to accept a US-led peace proposal, threatening that Washington would “walk away” if it was not accepted.The US proposal would mean “we’re going to freeze the territorial lines at some level close to where they are today,” Vance said during a trip to India on Wednesday. US president Donald Trump lashed out atVolodymyr Zelenskyyafter the Ukrainian leader rejected ceding Crimea to Russia as part of a potential peace plan.Trump, in a Truth Social post on Wednesday, said Zelenskyy is prolonging the “killing field” and making statements that are “very harmful” to the peace negotiations. Crimea was lost years ago “and is not even a point of discussion,” the US president said. Zelenskyy said on Tuesday his country could not accept recognising Crimea as Russian territory.“There is nothing new to mention or discuss. Ukraine will not recognise the occupation of Crimea,” he had said, adding that it would be incompatible with Ukraine’s constitution. On Wednesday, Zelenskyy countered with his own peace proposal. Ministerial-level Ukraine peace talks that were due to take place in London on Wednesday were postponed at the last minute after the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said he could not attend.UK foreign secretaryDavid Lammysaid his discussions with Rubio were productive. The late downgrade came amid speculation that Russia is willing to change its position in separate bilateral peace discussions. Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, the foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, and the defence minister, Rustem Umerov instead met with the US envoy, Keith Kellogg, in London.The Ukrainian delegation described the talks as “productive” and “constructive”. The Kremlin said Russia is engaged in direct talks with the US over the Ukraine war, but that there are no ongoing discussions with Europe or with Ukraine.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov dismissed media reports of what might be in any US-Russian peace proposal, and said there was still a lot to be worked out. Nine people were reportedly killed on Wednesday morning when a Russian drone hit a bus carrying workers in the Ukrainian city of Marhanets– one of 134 large drones that Ukrainian authorities reported had attacked the country overnight. Russia has imposed sanctions on 15 UK MPs and six members of the House of Lords,banning them from the country over what it called “hostile statements and unfounded accusations” about Moscow. Ukraine’s defence ministerRustem Umerovsaid the Ukrainian delegation held “productive” talks with the US envoy,Keith Kellogg,in London on Wednesday. Umerov, in televised comments, said: We talked about our consistent position regarding a ceasefire, also about security guarantees. For my part, I believe the meeting was very productive and successful. Separately,Andrii Sybiha, Ukraine’s foreign minister, said that during his meeting with Kellog a “constructive exchange of views on the path to peace” took place. He added: Ukraine wants the war to end more than anyone else in the world. We are committed to working together to achieve this goal.

Vance, on a trip to India on Wednesday, said there would have to be “some territorial swaps” to reach a deal. He said: We’ve issued a very explicit proposal to both the Russians and the Ukrainians, and it’s time for them to either say yes or for the United States to walk away from this process. The only way to really stop the killing is for the armies to both put down their weapons, to freeze this thing and to get on with the business of actually building a better Russia and a better Ukraine. Here’s the clip: Donald Trump, in a Truth Social post on Wednesday, accusedVolodymyr Zelenskyyof making “inflammatory” statements that are “very harmful” to the peace negotiations with Russia. Trump wrote: Nobody is asking Zelenskyy to recognize Crimea as Russian Territory but, if he wants Crimea, why didn’t they fight for it eleven years ago when it was handed over to Russia without a shot being fired? The US president described the situation inUkraineas being “dire”, and said Zelenskyy “can have peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole country.” “He has nothing to boast about!” Trump added. The statement made by Zelenskyy today will do nothing but prolong the ‘killing field,’ and nobody wants that! Donald Trump’s latest attack onVolodymyr Zelenskyycomes a day after the Ukrainian leader ruled out recognising Crimea as Russian territory as part of a potential peace plan. Zelenskyy, during a briefing in Kyiv on Tuesday, saidUkrainewill not legally recognise Russia’s occupation of Crimea under any circumstances. He told reporters: There is nothing new to mention or discuss. Ukraine will not recognise the occupation of Crimea. His remarks came amid speculation that Moscow had told Washington it might be willing to drop its claim to parts of Ukraine it does not occupy, in return for the US recognising the 2014 annexation of Crimea. Zelenskyy said no such proposal had been shared with him by the White House and that his country could not endorse it. He also warned that any discussion of Crimea risked shifting negotiations into a framework dictated by the Kremlin, and played directly intoVladimir Putin’s game. As soon as talks about Crimea and our sovereign territories begin, the talks enter the format that Russia wants — prolonging the war – because it will not be possible to agree on everything quickly. Russia imposes sanctions on 15 MPs and six members of the House of Lords, banning them from the country over what it called “hostile statements and unfounded accusations” about Moscow. The Russian foreign affairs ministrypublished a statement on Wednesdayaccusing the UK of “fabricating anti-Russian narratives” and attempting to “demonise” the country. The ministry announced sanctions against 21 British politicians from across the political spectrum, targeting parliamentarians who have called forfrozen Russian assets to be seized and used to fund Ukraine’s war effort. Those sanctioned include Labour MPs Phil Brickell, Jeevun Sandher, Johanna Baxter and Blair McDougall, and the Liberal Democrats’ Alistair Carmichael, Chris Coghlan, Helen Maguire and James MacCleary. Stephen Gethins of the Scottish National party and Jim Shannon of the Democratic Unionist party were also on the list. US president Donald Trump chided Ukrainian leaderVolodymyr Zelenskyyon Wednesday for saying Ukraine would not recognise Russia’s occupation of Crimea, which he called an inflammatory statement that will make a peace deal with Russia harder to achieve. “This statement is very harmful to the Peace Negotiations with Russia,”Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. He said Crimea was lost years ago “and is not even a point of discussion.” “We are very close to a Deal, but the man with ‘no cards to play’ should now, finally, GET IT DONE,” Trump added. “I look forward to being able to helpUkraine, and Russia, get out of this Complete and Total MESS, that would have never started if I were President!” A planned meeting Wednesday between top US, British, French and Ukrainian diplomats to push forward a peace deal between Russia andUkrainewas scrapped at the last minute, with US vice-president JD Vance saying negotiations are reaching a moment of truth. “We’ve issued a very explicit proposal to both the Russians and the Ukrainians, and it’s time for them to either say ‘yes’ or for the United States to walk away from this process,” Vance told reporters during a visit to Agra, India. He said it was “a very fair proposal” that would “freeze the territorial lines at some level close to where they are today,” with both sides having to give up some territory they currently hold. He did not provide further details of the proposal, AP reported. Ukraine said Wednesday that it was “committed” to Washington-led efforts to end the war with Russia after US vice-president JD Vance threatened to abandon negotiations if a deal was not reached soon. “We emphasised that we are committed to the peace efforts of US president Donald Trump,” Ukrainian presidential aide Andriy Yermak said after talks in London with representatives of Kyiv’s allies, adding: “We are grateful to our partners for their firm support and common desire to end the war as soon as possible.” Russia on Wednesday added 21 British parliamentarians to its list of UK nationals banned from entering the country, reflecting the dire state of relations with London. Moscow maintains extensive lists of foreign officials, business figures, journalists and others who are barred from entering Russian territory, mostly from countries officially designated as “unfriendly”. In a statement, Russia’s foreign ministry said that the designated lawmakers had made “hostile statements and unfounded accusations” against Moscow. They include six members of the House of Lords, along with 15 members of parliament from the governing Labour party, the centrist Liberal Democrats, the Scottish National Party and the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist party. Members of the French Foreign Legion and British soldiers have started a joint military exercise in northeastern France, applying urban warfare lessons from the conflict inUkraine, an AFP reporter said. Here is an extract from the report: A French officer, perched on a British armoured vehicle camouflaged with branches in the small town of Jeoffrecourt, translated commands for armoured infantry troops from Britain. The FFL and the Royal Welsh First Battalion were part of a team trying to capture this town of 5,000 residents Tuesday during a two-week training exercise. The exercises come as French president Emmanuel Macron and British prime minister Keir Starmer are spearheading European efforts to send what they call a “reassurance force” to Ukraine after any end to the war sparked by Russia’s 2022 invasion. “We look at what is happening in theatres of operation and new modes of action to integrate them,” said Lt Col Romain, an FFL training officer who gave only his first name under French military policy. A member of his 13th Demi-Brigade toggled a joystick from a basement where a video feed showed footage from the drone he controlled as it flew above the streets. With just four radios, four laptops and a white sheet serving as a makeshift projection screen, the setup was spartan but for good reason, said the brigade’s commanding officer, Col Benjamin Brunet. “We drill to change position every six hours,” Brunet said, a lesson gleaned from Ukraine, where adversaries quickly spot the electromagnetic radiation emitted from command posts to destroy them. For Capt Ed, a British intelligence officer who also could give only his first name, France and Britain have a proven track record of working together because they “share a similar mindset and values”. “Since 2018, the French and British have been together in Estonia” as part of a mission set up by Nato on its eastern flank, the captain said. “We are training and we are ready to go anywhere in the world,” he said. A topDutchcourt said Wednesday that the government could stop its support for foreigners living inUkrainewho fled afterRussia’s invasion, paving the way for their deportation, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). In its ruling, theCouncil of State (RvS), the country’s highest administrative court, said the government’s plan to end temporary asylum for the group of about 1,700 people could be implemented. Many of the refugees hailed from places includingAlgeria,TurkeyandPakistanand were working or studying in Ukraine at the time of Russia’s invasion in February 2022, reports AFP. Rights and refugee advocates have criticised the move to expel “third country nationals”. But the court “ruled today that the temporary protection for third-country nationals in Ukraine can end”, theHague-based court said in a statement. Government support for this group “can end earlier than for other Ukrainians, stateless persons and third country nationals with a permanent Ukrainian residency permit,” who are still temporarily being sheltered in the Netherlands, the statement said. The ruling came after previous Dutch government plans to halt the protection for non-Ukrainian nationals ran into legal obstacles including several lawsuits. The RvS had already ruled in January 2024 that temporary asylum for the group could end on 4 March 2024, before referring the matter to theEuropean court of justice (ECJ)for a legal opinion. In December, the ECJ confirmed that EU countries could end temporary residency for third-country nationals before other Ukrainian citizens, those with permanent residency status and stateless persons. “The reason for this is because EU member countries are not obligated to protect this group, although they may choose do so,” saidPieter-Bas Beekman, an RvS spokesperson. “The Council of State today confirms the decision by the European court of justice, which means that from 4 March last year, protection for third-country residents have ended in the Netherlands,” he said. There are about 118,000 registered Ukrainian refugees in total in the Netherlands, according to the latest government figures. Lithuania’s capitalVilniuspresented on Wednesday an evacuation plan in case of war, as theBalticnation worriesRussiacould target the former Soviet republic next after its invasion ofUkraine, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). Lithuania, aNatoandEUmember, has been a staunch ally of Ukraine sinceMoscow’s 2022 invasion, and has since ramped up defence spending and training. Emergency services have put out a fire at a car park in a shopping mall located inMoscow’s business district, the state Tass news agency reported on Wednesday, according to Reuters. Videos posted by variousRussianmedia outlets showed black smoke billowing among the district’s skyscrapers on the banks of theMoskva River. The cause of the explosion and whether anyone was in the vehicle at the time was unclear, reports Reuters.",

    "title": "Thousands from around world wait hours to visit coffin of Pope Francis",
    "article_text": "Thousands of people queued for hours under the hot spring sun in St Peter’s Square on Wednesday to pay their final respects toPope Francis, whose simple wooden coffin has been placed on the main altar of the 16th-century basilica, where he will lie in state until Friday evening. The pope, the head of the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics,died at his home inCasa Santa Marta on Monday aged 88 after a stroke and subsequent heart failure. He had been recovering from double pneumonia, which had kept him in hospital for five weeks. In keeping withhis requests for simple funeral rites, Francis was dressed in his vestments, holding a rosary, with his open casket lined with red cloth. Unlike those of most of his predecessors, his coffin, which is being watched over by two Swiss Guards, has not been raised on a platform. That was one of the rituals Francis shunned when he simplified rules for papal funerals last year. His funeral mass will take place at St Peter’s Square on Saturday morning, an event that will be attended by a host of world leaders and royals, including the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, the US president, Donald Trump, and Prince William. He will then be buried at the Santa Maria Maggiore Basilica in Rome’s Esquilino neighbourhood, breaking with longstandingVaticantradition. On Wednesday morning, mourners erupted into a prolonged but sombre applause as Francis’s coffin was carried through the square by pallbearers in a solemn procession involving dozens of cardinals and bishops, and watched over by Swiss Guards. The bells of the basilica gently tolled as a choir chanted psalms and prayers in Latin, repeating the call to “pray for us”. “It was the most profound moment,” said Cardinal Thomas Christopher Collins, the former archbishop of Toronto, who was among the procession. “But from the simple prayers to the incense, it was no different to a [funeral] ritual that any baptised person would have.” As of Wednesday night, a Vatican official said almost 20,000 people, from all parts of the world, had joined the queue, which stretched along the road leading to Vatican City, to pay their respects to Francis, many holding umbrellas to shield themselves from the sun. Braced for a long wait, Abigail and her family, from California, brought food. “We’re happy to wait as long as it takes,” she said. “It’s a privilege to be here.” It was only a few days ago that Francis had made his way through St Peter’s Square aboard the popemobile before appearing on the basilica’s central balconyto give a blessing to the crowds gathered for Easter Sunday mass. It was his final public appearance. Even though people were aware that Francis was seriously ill, some of those waiting in the queue to pay tribute were still struggling to digest the fact of his death. “It feels strange that he is no longer with us,” said Piotr Grzeszyk, from Poland. Their shoulders wrapped with the flag of Francis’s native Argentina, Vicky Cabral and her family arrived in Rome from Buenos Aires on Saturday and saw Francis on the balcony the next day. They had been hoping to get another glimpse of him during the now suspended canonisation of Carlo Acutis, which had been due to take place on 27 April. “We came toItalyfor the Catholic jubilee year and for Carlo Acutis,” said Cabral. “But it now feels like a real blessing to be here for this special moment. Francis was a great pope and I think he should be made a saint too.” Once through the huge bronze doors and inside the cavernous basilica, pilgrims fell silent as they shuffled slowly towards the altar. Francesco Catini, who travelled to Rome from Venice, had waited for four hours to see Francis’s body. “It was a beautiful experience,” he said. “To me, Francis was a living example of peace, of love, and especially of humility and solidarity.” Chiara Frassine, from Brescia in northern Italy, had waited a similar amount of time. “I’m very happy to be here,” she said as she left the basilica. “Pope Francis had a pure soul. He was a humble point of reference for many people, not just Catholics.” Not everyone waiting to pay their respects was Catholic. Standing at the end of the queue was Gunnar Prieß, from Germany, who arrived in the Italian capital on Wednesday morning. “I booked a flight only to be here to see this,” he said. “I am not Catholic, but this is so majestic. What we’re seeing here today is the expression of a holy ritual that goes back 2,000 years. There’s an aura in the Vatican and I wanted to experience it.” As the funeral rituals continue, speculation is rife about who will succeed Francis. Some 103 cardinals met on Wednesday evening and approved nine days of mourning from the date of the funeral, with a conclave –the secret election process to choose a new pope– therefore not expected to begin before 5 May. There is no clear frontrunner, although Luis Antonio Tagle, a reformer from the Philippines, and Pietro Parolin, from Italy, who were among the procession, are early favourites. Collins will be involved in the conclave too and, at 78, will be among the 135 cardinals eligible to vote. But he declined to give any hint of who he thought might succeed Francis.",

    "title": "Israel’s far-right security minister to visit Yale day after Mar-a-Lago dinner",
    "article_text": "Israel’s far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir was set to address a meeting at Yale University, a day after being honored at a lavish dinner atDonald Trump’sMar-a-Lagoresort. Ben-Gvir, who has past convictions for supporting terrorism and was considered persona non grata under the Biden administration, attended a fundraising event at the Florida resort on Tuesday, where he told attendees about harsh new measures implemented against Palestinian prisoners. “I love the American people very much,” Ben-Gvirtold attendeesvia a translator. “We have a joint war against the jihad.” Trump himself was absent and the minister was not expected to meet the US president, but Ben-Gvir’s spokesperson said the minister met with “dozens of senior businessmen from Miami” and the Republican House majority whip, Tom Emmer, according to theTimes of Israel. Emmer did not respond to a request for comment. Ben-Gvirposted on Xthat he “had the honor and privilege of meeting with senior Republican Party officials at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate”, though it is unclear who those officials were. “They expressed support for my very clear position on how to act in Gaza and that the food and aid depots should be bombed in order to create military and political pressure to bring our hostages home safely.” Ben-Gvir, a hardline Jewish settler from the occupied West Bank who has advocated for the deportation of all Arab citizens, has been an integral part of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition since 2022, and has threatened to leave his side should the war in Gaza end. His presence in the Israeli government has been a source of international concern; major American Jewish organizations distanced themselves from his current visit, and demonstrators allied with Yale’s Students for Justice in Palestine set upprotests on the university’s grounds ahead of his scheduled appearance at a meeting of Shabtai, a Jewish society based at the university. Yale did not return a request for comment. Khaled Elgindy, a visiting scholar at Georgetown University’s Center for Contemporary Arab Studies, expressed alarm at Ben-Gvir’s reception in the United States. “The fact that someone like Ben-Gvir … is even being hosted by US institutions is in and of itself deeply disturbing,” said Elgindy. “That the GOP is aligned with the most fanatical elements in Israeli politics, while perhaps not surprising, is extremely alarming and does not bode well for the stability of the region.” Ben-Gvirwas convictedin 2007 of racist incitement and support for groups on terrorism blacklists. For years, he prominently displayed a photo in his living room of Baruch Goldstein, who massacred 29 Muslim worshippers in Hebron in 1994. In 2022, the Biden administration condemned Ben-Gvir’s visit to the memorial ofviolently racist and anti-Palestinian rabbi Meir Kahane, whom the national security minister was a follower of in his youth. “Celebrating the legacy of a terrorist organization is abhorrent. There is no other word for it,” US state department spokesperson Ned Price saidat the time. “We urge all parties to maintain calm, exercise restraint, and to refrain from actions that only serve to exacerbate tensions and that includes in Jerusalem.” But since joining Netanyahu’s coalition government, Ben-Gvir has continued his provocations, including an inflammatory visit to the Al-Aqsa mosque compound last year – also a historically significant and highly venerated holy site in Judaism – that drew international outrage and a rebukefrom Netanyahu himselflast summer. Ben-Gvir again visited the Al-Aqsa mosque earlier this month,prompting more outragein the region. The White House did not return a request for comment. Following Yale, Ben Gvir wasexpected to addressa gathering on New York’s Upper East Side, focusing on “securing Israel post-October 7th”.",

    "title": "Children in school shelter among 25 killed in wave of Israeli strikes on Gaza",
    "article_text": "At least 25 people have been killed in Israeli airstrikes across Gaza, including 11 in the bombing of a school turned shelter, the strip’s civil defence agency said, as Israel’s war against Hamas in the besieged Palestinian territory grinds on despite a new ceasefire proposal from Arab mediators. Intense Israeli bombings hit several areas ofGazaon Wednesday, killing 11 in a school sheltering displaced people in al-Tuffah, a neighbourhood of Gaza City. The strike ignited a huge fire that claimed most of the casualties, said a civil defence spokesperson, Mahmoud Bassal. The Qatari network Al Jazeera and Palestinian media broadcast footage of several bodies wrapped in white shrouds at al-Shifa hospital’s morgue, and women weeping over the body of a child. “We were sleeping and suddenly something exploded, we started looking and found the whole school on fire, the tents here and there were on fire, everything was on fire,” a witness, Umm Mohammed al-Hwaiti, told Reuters. “People were shouting and men were carrying people, charred [people], charred children, and were walking and saying ‘dear God, dear God, we have no one but you’. What can we say? Dear God, only,” she said. Unusually, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not comment on the school attack. Israeli officials say fighters from Hamas and allied factions hide behind civilian infrastructure, claims that the Palestinian militant group denies. Israel has renewed its aerial and ground campaign since the collapse of a two-month-old ceasefire and hostage and prisoner release swap in mid-March. Since then, according to the UN, nearly 2,000 people have been killed and another 420,000 forced to leave their homes or shelters as Israel seizes ever-larger swathes of the territory for what it terms security buffer zones. More than 51,300 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s retaliatory offensive after the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel in which 1,200 people were killed and another 250 taken captive. Fifty-nine hostages remain in Gaza. Israel imposed a total blockade on the strip two weeks before it unilaterally restarted the fighting. Food, water, fuel and medicine are now running critically low, leading aid agencies to declare that Gaza’s already devastating humanitarian crisis is worse than ever. On Wednesday, the foreign ministers of the UK, France and Germany urged Israel to stop blocking aid into Gaza, warning of “an acute risk of starvation, epidemic disease and death”. “Humanitarian aid must never be used as a political tool and Palestinian territory must not be reduced nor subjected to any demographic change,” the ministers said. The joint statement – unusually strong criticism from some of Israel’s closest allies – came several weeks after similar calls from the UN, EU and Arab states. Efforts led by Qatari and Egyptian mediators to resume talks aimed at a ceasefire and ending the war have not yet led to a breakthrough. Reports of a new plan emerged on Wednesday that would include a truce of between five and seven years, and the release of the rest of the Israeli hostages seized in October 2023. Sign up toGlobal Dispatch Get a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team after newsletter promotion A Hamas delegation travelled to the Egyptian capital, Cairo, late on Tuesday to discuss the proposal. Israel has not responded to the invitation to another round of indirect negotiations. There has been little sign that either side is willing to move closer on fundamental issues such as the disarmament of Hamas or the withdrawal of Israeli troops, although it is believed mediators are under pressure from Washington to show progress before Donald Trump’s visit to the Middle East next month. The president of the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority (PA), Mahmoud Abbas, made a rare intervention in the conflict on Wednesday, calling for Hamas to free the Israeli hostages and saying their captivity provided Israel with “excuses” to attack Gaza. Basem Naim, a senior Hamas official, called Abbas’s remarks “insulting”. Hamas and Abbas’s secular Fatah party, which dominates the semi-autonomous Palestinian Authority, fought a brief civil war in 2007 that resulted in Hamas seizing control of Gaza.",

    "title": "Jordan shuts local branch of Muslim Brotherhood after arrests",
    "article_text": "Jordan has said it is shutting down the local branch of theMuslim Brotherhoodand banning membership of the Islamist political group. The ban came a week afterJordansaid it had arrested 16 members of the Muslim Brotherhood accused of threatening national security by training militants, making explosives and plotting to strike targets in Jordan with rockets and drones. The Muslim Brotherhood denied any involvement in the alleged plot. Jordan’s interior minister, Mazen Farraya, connected the ban with the alleged plot, saying members of the group had attempted to “smuggle and destroy large quantities of documents from its headquarters” on the same night that authorities carried out arrests. Farraya said the Muslim Brotherhood had been “working in secret and undertaking activities that threatened to undermine stability, security and national unity.”. The Muslim Brotherhood is a political Islamist group founded in Cairo in 1928 that has branches across the Middle East, including in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Palestine. Jordan’s move to ban the Jordanian branch comes after years of a steadily tightening crackdown on the group. The group’s political wing, the Islamic Action Front (IAF), won 31 out of 138 parliamentary seats in elections last September and it is the largest and most popular opposition organisation in Jordan. The group has criticised the Jordanian government’s 1994 peace treaty with Israel, which is largely unpopular among citizens, the majority of whom are of Palestinian descent. It also took an active role in demonstrations in Amman, Jordan’s capital, against Israel’s war in Gaza. Last year, Human Rights Watch criticised Jordanian authorities for arresting and harassing “scores of Jordanians” who participated in the pro-Palestine protests or posted online in support of them. Jordan’s government has been outspoken against the war in Gaza, expelling Israel’s ambassador and consistently calling for an end to the humanitarian siege on the territory. Protesters have called for the government to scrap the peace treaty between the two countries, cancel an unpopular gas deal and end all exports to Israel. The Muslim Brotherhood and its ally in Gaza, Hamas, have seen a surge in popularity among Jordanians since the start of the war. Jordan expelled Hamas’s leadership and shut its offices in 1999, and it views the group’s growing popularity among its own population warily. Authorities searched the headquarters and branches of the IAF across the country on Wednesday. A week earlier, authorities arrested Khaled al-Johani, the office director of the IAF. Wael Sakka, the IAF’s general secretary, told the Guardian that the group’s work would continue despite the ban on the Muslim Brotherhood. “Our party has no organisational link with any other entity and we are in compliance with the provisions of the constitution, the political parties law and Jordanian law,” Sakka said. Farraya said the government was committed to guaranteeing freedom of expression and political activity in accordance with the law. The country’s cybercrime unit later said publishing anything on social media relating to the Muslim Brotherhood would be met with legal action. Rights groups have warned of a steady erosion of civic space in Jordan in recent years, with Freedom House downgrading the country from “partially free” to “not free” in 2021 due to its crackdown on civil society. The passing of a new cybercrime law in 2023 that criminalised speech on social media that “undermined national unity” drew criticism from rights groups.",

    "article_text": "Sharon Osbourne has urged US authorities to revoke work visas for Kneecap after theIrish language rap groupused a performance at Coachella to denounce Israeli attacks on Gaza. The TV presenter accused the band of hate speech and supporting terrorist organisations and said it should not be allowed to perform in the US. “I urge you to join me in advocating for the revocation of Kneecap’s work visa,” she exhorted followers on X on Tuesday. Fox News commentators also condemned the band and accused it of bringing “Nazi Germany” sentiments to America. Kneecap scorned the Fox News comments and posted supportive messages from fans, saying it had received thousands of such endorsements as well as “hundreds of violent Zionist threats”. Almost all the concerts of a US tour scheduled for October have sold out, it added. The trio, Móglaí Bap and Mo Chara from Belfast and DJ Próvaí from Derry, have built a following in the US with a mix of Irish republican totems, punk spirit and afilmthat stormedlast year’s Utah film festival. During their set last weekend atCoachella, the California desert music festival, Mo Chara said Britain had persecuted Irish people but not bombed them from the skies. “The Palestinians have nowhere to go.” The performers led the audience in chants of “free, free Palestine” and screened pro-Palestinian messages on to screens. “Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people,” said one. “It is being enabled by the US government who arm and fundIsraeldespite their war crimes,” said another. The last used an expletive against Israel. Osbourne, a judge on the TV show America’s Got Talent, said the festival had “compromised its moral and spiritual integrity” by allowing Kneecap and Green Day to denounce Israel over the 18-month war. “Music’s primary purpose is to unite people. It should not be a venue for promoting terrorist organisations or spreading hate”, she said, singling out Kneecap’s “aggressive” political statements. “This band openly support terrorist organisations. This behaviour raises concerns about the appropriateness of their participation in such a festival and further shows they are booked to play in the USA.” Fox News commentators compared the band’s comments to Nazi Germany, with one saying the band should be removed from “authority positions” and that the “values of education” should be re-instilled. Kneecap posted a clip of the segment and said the commentator’s admission that she had not previously heard of the band was the “only part of this shite that made any sense”. The group said they had planned to denounce “US-backed genocide in Gaza” at an earlier performance in Coachella, on 11 April, but that the comments did not appear on the screen. The band also complained that the festival’s livestream did not carry a chant celebrating the death of Margaret Thatcher.",

    "title": "Kashmir attack sparks fear of fresh conflict between India and Pakistan",
    "article_text": "The brutal militant attack thatkilled 26 people in one of Kashmir’s most scenic spotshas shattered the region’s relative calm, turning a popular tourist destination into a scene of horror – and raising fears of a fresh conflict between nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan. Soon after the attack in which gunmen emerged from dense pine woods and opened fire on families picnicking and riding ponies, India’s defence minister, Rajnath Singh, vowed a “loud and clear response”. A little-known outfit called the Resistance Front claimed responsibility for the attack, but India believes the group to be a proxy for the Lashkar-e-Taiba terror group or another Pakistan-based faction.Pakistandenies backing insurgents, but says it supports Kashmiri calls for self-determination. The massacre has reignited tensions between the two neighbours, which have fought three wars over the disputed Muslim-majority territory and come close to conflict several times. An Indian security analyst who asked not to be named said the attack came a week after Pakistan’s army chief, Gen Asim Munir, describedKashmiras Pakistan’s “jugular” and promised not to “leave our Kashmiri brothers in their heroic struggle”. “This is a very pivotal moment for the region. We have two nuclear-armed neighbours staring at each other,” said the US foreign policy author and South Asia expert Michael Kugelman. “All bets could be off.” Among its first retaliatory moves, India announced the expulsion of the Pakistan high commission’s defence, navy and air advisers; the closure of a critical border trading point; and – for the first time – the suspension of the crucial Indus waters treaty. The treaty governs the shared waters of one of the world’s biggest river systems that affects millions of lives in both countries, and India has never previously put the deal “in abeyance” – even in times of open conflict between the two neighbours. But if the terrorists hoped the assault would win support from Kashmiris or revive separatist sentiment, they miscalculated: more than a dozen Kashmiri groups staged a complete shutdown of stores and businesses to mourn the victims, while local people held protest marches chanting: “Tourists are our lives.” “Kashmiris are genuinely appalled,” said Siddiq Wahid, a professor in the department of international relations at Shiv Nadar University. Militant violence has plagued Kashmir, claimed by both Hindu-majority India and Islamic Pakistan, since an anti-Indian insurgency began in 1989. Thousands have been killed, although violence has tapered off in recent years. In a controversial move in 2019, Narendra Modi’s government revoked Jammu and Kashmir’s semi-autonomous constitutional status, splitting the state into two federally governed territories. The government, known for its embrace of a Hindu-first political agenda, also allowed non-local land ownership to further integrate Kashmir with the rest of India. The security clampdown reduced militant activity and tourism surged – a record 3.5 million people visited the Kashmir valley in 2024. Modi has framed Kashmir’s “normalisation” as a political triumph, saying firm action resolved the separatist issue and made the snow-capped, lush region “open for business”, although there is some local resentment at the heavy militarisation. “Unfortunately, this attack punctures the government’s narrative that things are ‘normal’,” said another Indian security analyst who also requested anonymity. Modi’s swift return from an official visit to Saudi Arabia signals the government’s determination to respond. Pressure is mounting for a strong response to the daylight attack in a heavily militarised zone. Delhi may opt for cross-border strikes, as it did after the 2019 Pulwama suicide bombing that killed 40 Indian paramilitary troops, analysts said. But this time, the victims were not soldiers or security personnel, making the situation even more politically charged. “India cannot twiddle its thumbs. Once the escalatory ladder is revved up, it can go out of hand,” said the security analyst. “You cannot read Modi, you can’t predict the man. He is very muscular,” he added. What heightens the political dynamics of the Kashmir attack is the timing – during a high-level US visit. The US vice- president, JD Vance, on his first official trip to India, emphasised strengthening defence ties and praised India as a strategic partner. In 2002, India and Pakistan came very close to full-scale war aftera terrorist attack on the Indian parliamentin December 2001 that New Delhi blamed on Pakistan-based militant groups. The US played a key diplomatic role in de-escalating the crisis. “The messaging we are seeing from senior officials points to the US being fully behind India – and that it would not stand in the way of how India will respond,” Kugelman said.",

    "title": "India closes land border with Pakistan after 26 tourists killed in Kashmir attack",
    "article_text": "India has closed a key land border withPakistan, cancelled a water-sharing treaty and barred Pakistan’s citizens from entering under a visa exemption scheme after Tuesday’s attack by Islamic militants in Kashmir that killed 26 tourists. India’s defence minister, Rajnath Singh, said those who carried out and planned theKashmirregion’s worst attack on civilians in years, including those “behind the scenes”, would see a swift response. Announcing the downgrading of relations with Pakistan, the Indian foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, told a media briefing that cross-border connections to the attack had been “brought out” at a special meeting of the security cabinet, after which it was decided to act. Misri said India was suspending the Indus water treaty “until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism”. Pakistan has denied involvement in the attack and said its prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, would chair a national security committee meeting on Thursday to respond. Indian security forces fanned out across the Himalayan region of Kashmir on Wednesday as the army and police launched a massive manhunt for the perpetrators of the attack on Tuesday that killed at least 26 tourists, all men. Amid rapidly rising tensions in the region, which has been riven by militant violence since the start of an anti-Indian insurgency in 1989, survivors said the militants had asked men they had rounded up to recite Islamic verses before executing those who couldn’t. Asavari Jagdale, from India’s western state of Maharashtra, who lost her father and uncle in the attack, told local media that she and her family hid inside a nearby tent along with other tourists when the shooting started. When the militants reached their tent, Asavari said, they asked her father, Santosh Jagdale, to come out and recite an Islamic verse. “When he failed to do so, they pumped three bullets into him, one on the head, one behind the ear and another in the back,” she said. “My uncle was next to me. The terrorists fired four to five bullets into him.” Debasish Bhattacharyya, a Hindu who teaches at Assam University and who grew up in a Muslim neighbourhood in the state, told Reuters he had been spared because he was familiar with Islamic verses. The militants ordered him and those nearby on to their knees and when the others started chanting the verses, he followed along. “I knew the words and at that moment it was probably the only way to save our lives. Those who failed were killed,” he said, adding that they fled when the gunmen left, and trekked through a forest for two hours. A little-known militant group, the Kashmir Resistance, claimed responsibility for the attack. Posting on social media, it expressed discontent that more than 85,000 “outsiders” had been settled in the region, spurring a “demographic change”. The attack, reportedly involving four gunmen, took place in a meadow in the Pahalgam area of the scenic Himalayan federal territory. The dead were 25 Indians and one Nepalese national. It was the worst attack on civilians in India since the 2008 Mumbai shootings. The prime minister, Narendra Modi, cut short a two-day visit to Saudi Arabia and returned to Delhi on Wednesday morning. He held a meeting with his national security adviser, the foreign minister and other senior officials at the airport, and a special security cabinet meeting was called for later on Wednesday. The incident is being viewed as a major escalation in the regional conflict, in which attacks targeting tourists have been rare. The last deadly attack took place in June 2024 when at least nine people were killed and 33 injured after militants caused a bus carrying Hindu pilgrims to plunge into a deep gorge. The Kashmir Resistance claimed those attacked on Tuesday “were not ordinary tourists; instead, they were linked to and affiliated with Indian security agencies”. The attack prompted an immediate exodus of tourists from the region, with airlines operating extra flights from Srinagar, the summer capital of the territory. Local television showed tourists carrying their bags to taxis and filing out of a hotel in Srinagar. “How can we continue our trip in such a situation?” Sameer Bhardwaj, a tourist from Delhi, said to the news agency ANI. “We need to prioritise our safety. We can only travel if our minds are relaxed but everyone is tense here. So we cannot continue to travel.” Gulzar Ahmad, a taxi driver in Pahalgam, said: “This attack will impact our work but we are more concerned about the loss of lives. No matter what we do in the future, our tourism industry has been stained by this attack. The perpetrators must receive exemplary punishment so that no one dares to commit such an act again.” The attack occurred during a four-day visit to India by the US vice-president, JD Vance, who called it a “devastating terrorist attack”. Omar Abdullah, the region’s top elected official, posted on social media: “It’s heartbreaking to see the exodus of our guests from the [Kashmir] valley after yesterday’s tragic terror attack in Pahalgam. But at the same time, we totally understand why people would want to leave.” There has been an increase in the number of targeted killings of Hindus, including migrant workers from other Indian states, in the disputed Himalayan region since Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party government unilaterally revoked Kashmir’s limited autonomy in 2019 by imposing a communication blockade and jailing activists and political leaders. It split the state into two federally administered territories – Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh – and allowed local authorities to issue domicile certificates to outsiders, enabling them to apply for jobs and buy land. Since then, civil liberties and media freedom in the region have been severely curtailed. Pakistan’s foreign office spokesperson, Shafqat Khan, issued a statement saying Pakistan was “concerned about the loss of tourists’ lives in the attack”, and extended condolences to the victims.",

    "title": "UK seeks global green investors with windfarm cash and planning policies",
    "article_text": "The UK is to woo global green investors, including those scared away from the US by theactions of Donald Trump, by offering cash and infrastructure improvements to encourage companies to set up manufacturing plants and supply chains. The government will bring forward £300m for offshore windfarms, an area in which the UK retains a lead, and has invited banks and major international companies to a60-country summitin London this week. Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, has written to dozens of global investors citing the UK’s industrial strategy and commitment to moving to low-carbon electricity by 2030. “We are looking at opportunities all over the world to attract clean energy investment and are setting up conversations with companies from all countries, to ensure the UK can be a winner in the global race for the clean industries of the future,” a government source said. Under the US presidency of Joe Biden, whoseInflation Reduction Actoffered billions in incentives for low-carbon technology manufacturing, international investors flocked to America. But renewable industry insiders say many companies have been spooked by the actions of Trump, who hasdeclared his scorn for wind and solar energyand promoted fossil fuels. That leaves some investors reconsidering their US plans for fear of losing money. Last week the Trump administrationordered a haltto work on a new windfarm off the coast near New York owned by the Norwegian company Equinor. “That kind of thing really worries investors,” said one insider. “Nobody knows what will happen next.” On Thursday afternoon, Keir Starmer will address theenergy security summit, which is being held in partnership with the International Energy Agency, He will vow to double down on the UK’s commitments to a low-carbon economy despite attacks on net zero from the Conservatives and Reform UK. Starmer said before the summit’s start: “Let my message to the world go out: come and build the clean energy future in Britain.” Ajai Ahluwalia, the head of supply chain at RenewableUK, a trade association, said: “US companies are already interested in investing in the UK’s rapidly expanding clean energy sector, for example in helping to develop ports for the offshore wind industry. “The global uncertainty currently being caused by President Trump’s ever-changing policies on tariffs, and his opposition to clean energy, mean that the UK has an even greater opportunity than before to provide a stable, attractive market for international investors in renewables.” Labour has pledged £8.3bn to Great British Energy, a nationally owned company that willco-invest in clean energy projectswith the private sector, over this parliament, though this has been called into question as the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, takes an axe to spending. The US will send a senior official to the summit, which will take place at Lancaster House in London on Thursday and Friday, but China will skip the event. China’s president, Xi Jinping,attended a small UN online climate meetingon Wednesday with heads of state and the UN secretary general, at which he vowed to press ahead with clean energy despite “some major country’s pursuit of unilateralism and protectionism”. While the renewable energy industry welcomed the government’s measures, wildlife campaigners raised concerns over changes to the planning system designed to streamline new energy and other developments. The government tabled an amendment to its planning and infrastructure bill on Wednesday that would mean less consultation at the pre-application stage for “nationally significant infrastructure projects”. Matt Browne, the head of public affairs at the Wildlife Trusts, said the move was a “misstep” and called for reconsideration. Sign up toDown to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion “The government is proposing changes through the planning bill which would be disastrous for the natural world and undermine infrastructure delivery,” he said. “Removing the opportunity for experts to improve proposals at an early stage could lead to badly designed infrastructure which harms precious natural areas and destroy communities’ much-loved green spaces.” Campaigners also called for more focus on the UK’s domestic energy agenda. Mike Childs, the head of science, policy and research at Friends of the Earth, said much more effort was needed to insulate draughty homes, as well as to build renewables. “Our country has been held hostage by the yo-yo-ing price of dirty fossil fuels for far too long,” he said. Labour will face opposition to its clean energy plans, and its commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, in the local elections next week. Reform and the Conservatives arelikely to blame net zero for high pricesand the crisis in the steel industry, though experts have said these arethe result of an overreliance on fossil fuels. Rob Gross, a director at the UK energy research centre, said the UK’s electricity costs would begin to fall once it had severed its reliance on gas power plants, which generate the most expensive electricity on the grid and set the overall market price. “If you look across Europe, and you look at the electricity wholesale price, those with the lowest wholesale market prices are those which are least reliant on gas for generation. Those that have the highest prices are those most exposed to gas generation,” he said. “Our reliance on gas for electricity generation has been decreasing steadily as the share of renewables increases, but it will take several more years before we have severed the link to price formation.”",

Fatigue among frontline personnel causing them to make mistakes is a “significant” risk to patients, according to theHealthServices Safety Investigation Body (HSSIB). It “contributes directly and indirectly to patient harm”, yet is not properly appreciated as a risk by the NHS, possibly because of the perceived “heroism” of NHS staff. Exhaustion hasled to doctors and nurses harming patientsby inserting feeding tubes in the wrong place, leaving swabs inside a woman who had just given birth and mislabelling blood samples. But the NHS safety regulator for England also found that staff who are driving home after finishing a long shift could die in a road accident because they are extremely tired. “Fatigue was found to have a negative impact on staff safety,” the HSSIB said in a report, which is based on interviews with about 100 staff and evidence from national organisations. “A key risk related to this was staff driving home after a long shift and being involved in fatal car accidents or near misses.” Organisations representing doctors have highlighted that danger after a number of medics died in such circumstances, includingDr Ronak Patel, a trainee anaesthetist, in 2015. His death prompted the Association of Anaesthetists to launch acampaignto raise awareness of how common such incidents are and to demand that NHS organisations do more to safeguard the welfare of staff doing night shifts, for example by giving them somewhere to have a nap before going home. Patel, who was 33, was singing to his wife, Helen, on a hands-free phone while driving home after finishing the last of a run of three night shifts at the Norfolk and Norwich universityhospital in Norwich. A police officer who investigated the crash told the inquest into Patel’s death that “the most plausible explanation for the collision was that Dr Patel fell asleep which prevented him from having appropriate control of his car”. Dr Jyothis Manalayil also died in a crash in June 2022 while driving to an appointment with medical students in Blackpool after working overnight at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary. Alan Wilson, the coroner who presided at his inquest, said he had not been driving at high speed. “That gives two possibilities, that he simply was distracted by thinking about something else and at the wrong time lost concentration, or that he fell asleep,” he said. “We know he is a junior [resident] doctor working long hours and it could have been just fatigue.” Staff end up fatigued because of long shifts, heavy workloads and a lack of breaks and rest facilities at work, the HSSIB added. But personal issues such as caring responsibilities, menopause, pregnancy and religious practices can also contribute. “Being a doctor typically involves high intensity, time-pressured working patterns. This can lead to sleep deprivation and fatigue, affecting doctors’ health, wellbeing and performance, their safety and that of their patients,” said Dr Latifa Patel, the chair of the British Medical Association’s representative body and workforce lead. “The findings of this report are concerning, but will come as no surprise to the doctors who have faced 13-hour back-to-back shifts with no respite.” NHS trusts and health boards need to do more to improve rest facilities, doctors’ rotas and common room areas, to stop medics getting so exhausted, she added. “This report lays bare the daily reality for nursing staff. They are overstretched, understaffed and regularly work beyond their hours caring for too many patients,” said Patricia Marquis, the Royal College of Nursing’s executive director for England. “This drives dangerous levels of fatigue which not only harms patients but also follows staff home, with sometimes devastating consequences. “Nursing fatigue is deadly and in health and care services should be treated as a public safety emergency.” A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “This government inherited a broken NHS with an overworked, demoralised workforce and this report highlights the profound consequences this can have for patients and staff alike.” They highlighted the pay rises the government gave NHS staff in England and a recent support package intended to improve their working lives, including easier access to flexible working.",

    "title": "BBC announces 2025 Proms lineup – including first female-fronted Last Night",
    "article_text": "The BBC today announce its eight-week Proms season featuring 86 concerts in London, Bradford, Belfast, Bristol and Gateshead. A record number of female conductors will be at the podium – 15 – and the Last Night will be the first to feature an all-female lineup of conductor and soloists:Elim Chanwill conduct, with trumpeter Alison Balsom and sopranoLouise Alder, plus the evening will feature two world premieres, by 34-year-old French composer Camille Pepin, andRachel Portman, who was the first woman to win an Oscar for best original score, both making their Proms debuts. Also making herPromsdebut will be Claudia Winkleman, who, fully cloaked, will present a Traitors Prom featuring a mix of symphonic pop and classical music exploring timeless themes of intrigue, treachery and betrayal. Suzy Klein, the head of arts and classical music TV at the BBC, promised that the concert would evoke all the drama of the Highland castle where the hugely popular reality TV show takes place. There won’t be gameplay or interaction, she added, but “it is going to be shaped and curated as a dramatic evening. There’s so much music featured in the series that we wanted to take some of that and say to people, ‘Welcome to the world of classical music, you’re already listening to it and loving it without realising it!’” Winkleman will be joined by the BBC Scottish Symphony and the BBC Singers, with other guests and the full programme to be announced. Will season three fan favourite Linda Rands, a retired opera singer, be taking part? Potentially, said Klein. SuccessfulBBCbrands will also be giving shape to the children’s concerts: a CBeebies bedtime story prom and the return of the Wildlife Jamboree Prom in Gateshead’s Glasshouse Centre for Music. The Ulster Orchestra will perform a concert celebrating the centenary of the Shipping Forecast with music inspired by the sea and a new work composed and performed by poet laureate Simon Armitage. And, although not quite a Proms first (1983’s seasonfeatured an all-night prom of Indian classical music), the first overnight prom of the 21st century will run from 11pm to 7am and, curated and conducted by organist Anna Lapwood, will also feature Japanese pianist and YouTube sensation Hayato Sumino alongside the much loved Norwegian ensemble Barokksolistene. “We want it to be very engaging, there will be a real breadth of repertoire,” said Sam Jackson, the controller of BBC Radio 3 and the Proms. “There’s something very special about classical music at night time. The intimacy of certain repertoire really lends itself to that kind of immersive listening,” he continued. “But the intention is not simply to put people to sleep for eight hours, although audiences can of course come and respond to the music in whatever way you want!” Blankets and pillows will however not be allowed into the Royal Albert Hall, the venue confirmed, nor will the seating be reconfigured. “The only time Lapwood gets to practice the RAH organ is usually between midnight and four in the morning, because it’s the only time when somebody isn’t getting in or getting out for another gig. She absolutely knows how to unleash energy at that time of the day!” added Klein. Among some notable anniversaries honoured this year, there will be a focus on the music of Shostakovich, who died in 1975, and a complete performance – only the second ever at the Proms – of his opera Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District, with the chorus of the English National Opera. Proms regulars Aurora Orchestra will perform his fifth symphony by heart following a dramatic exploration of its troubled origins and meaning, andChineke!will celebrate their 10th birthday with guest conductor Simon Rattle leading the Black and ethnically diverse orchestra through a programme that includes Shostakovich’s 10th symphony. Ravel – born 150 years ago – features on the opening weekend: his Piano Concerto for the Left Hand will be played by Nicholas McCarthy, which will be the first time the concerto has been played at the Proms by a one-handed pianist since it was performed by the man it was composed for, Paul Wittgenstein, in 1932.Boulez, whose centenary is celebrated this year, features in three proms including a late-night one performed by the Ensemble intercontemporain (the group he founded), which places his modernist music alongside Luciano Berio’s, whose centenary it also is. Other international orchestras include the Royal Concertgebouw with their chief conductor designate Klaus Mäkelä, the Vienna Philharmonic, and the Budapest Festival Orchestra. Twenty-five proms will be televised – more than ever before, said Klein. “We had record breaking numbers last year, over 5m streams on BBC Sounds, and across TV and iPlayer we reached nearly 13 million people.” TheRoyal Albert Hallwas full to 96% capacity for evening Proms in 2024, said Jackson. He confirmed that the Last Night will end in its now traditional style, with Rule, Britannia among the closing pieces. “The Last Night always evokes strong opinions and discussion. There are some people for whom it’s a really important tradition, and there are some who say it’s now part of how they would like to celebrate in the summer,” he said. “Our job is to cater for as broad an audience as possible, but also to ask, how can we continue to develop this festival? What can we do differently? How can we introduce new music? And how can we over the course of 86 concerts make sure that there’s a real breadth of repertoire of artists? And then there’s something for everybody.” The Promswill run from 18 July to 13 September. General booking opens at 9am on 17 May.",

    "article_text": "Police have launched a manhunt after a convicted murderer escaped from an open prison inScotland. Raymond McCourt, 59, was reported missing from HMP Castle Huntly in Dundee at 5.30pm on Tuesday. Police Scotland have warned the public not to approach him. McCourt is described as 6ft 2in, stocky, with short grey hair and a beard and has reduced mobility. He uses public transport, with connections to the Glasgow and Edinburgh areas, the force added. The convicted murderer was last known to be wearing a long black trenchcoat, grey dress trousers, a grey waistcoat, a blue shirt with a red and white tie and brown shoes. McCourt was jailed for life in 1993 for the murder of shopkeeper Khalid Mahmood and for shooting a woman, Moira Rooney, and PC Brian Williams, who was giving chase. He was jailed for charges including murder, attempted murder, assault and robbery, assault to severe injury and firearms offences. McCourt was freed in 2015 but returned to prison after admitting stealing his partner’s valuables from her home in Perthshire and selling them within weeks of being released.",

    "title": "Rachel Reeves dashes hopes of early breakthrough in UK-US trade deal",
    "article_text": "Rachel Reeves has dashed hopes of an early breakthrough in trade talks with the Trump administration, stressing that the UK is “not going to rush” into a deal. Speaking before her first face-to-face meeting with the US Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, in which she was expected to lobby him to reduce tariffs, the chancellor said negotiations would take time. “We’re not going to rush a deal. We want to get the right deal that’s in our national interest, and those talks are ongoing,” she said. Asked about her discussions with Bessent – the first time the pair will meet face to face – Reeves said: “We’re not going to be, I don’t think, discussing the intricacies of autos and food standards.” Instead, she said, they would be talking about “how we can build on the trade relationship that we have”. The UK has already offered concessions to the US in the hopes of getting tariffs cut, including reducing the digital services tax on US tech companies. Reeves travelled to Washington for the spring meetings of the IMF with hopes of securing a carve-out from the 25% levies on cars, aluminium and steel. Car industry bosses have warnedjob losses are weeks awayin Britain’s premium automotive sector unless the UK can secure a deal to shield the likes of Jaguar Land Rover, Rolls-Royce, Bentley, Aston Martin and McLaren from tariffs. It is unclear whether an exemption from the 10% base tariff Donald Trump has levied on all imports is on the table. Hopes of an early agreement were undermined on Wednesday by a leaked document setting out new US demands. The text, which first appeared in the Wall Street Journal, dismayed UK officials by including calls for concessions in a series of new areas, including a demand for the government to drop its standards on agricultural products including beef. Allowing US hormone-treated beef into the UK has long been a demand from Washington, which successive British governments of all stripes have rejected. Reducing agricultural standards is a particular red line for Labour because it would kill hopes of a veterinary agreement with the EU. Reeves flatly rejected the idea that food or other product standards would be up for grabs. “We’re not going to be relaxing our food standards. We are clear with the US about that and they respect that and understand that,” she said. She added: “These are all discussions around tariffs and trade barriers but we are not going to be changing our standards based on asks from foreign governments. Decisions around food standards, around digital services, around auto standards, are decisions for the UK government to make and we will continue to do that.” She did not rule out discussing another request in the leaked US negotiating document, that the UK should reduce import tariffs on US cars from 10% to 2.5% to secure a deal. “I’m not going to give a commentary on the numbers but I have always been clear that I believe in free trade,” Reeves said. Later on Wednesday, appearing at a live event for global investors, Reeves appeared to hint that the UK was indeed prepared to cut import taxes on some US goods to placate Washington. “There are still tariffs, both ways, even before ‘liberation day’, between our two economies. I would like to see those tariffs – and non-tariff barriers – reduce,” she said. Reeves’s cautious tone contrasted withrecent mood musicfrom the government suggesting much of the deal had all but been agreed. Asked about the urgent plight of UK carmakers, Reeves said: “We’re under no illusions about the scale of the challenges that tariffs pose to UK car manufacturers and beyond, which is why we are working to secure a deal. “But I think everybody agrees that the most important thing is that we get the right deal for Britain in our national interest, rather than rush into a poor deal.” Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion One British official said the leak of Washington’s demands showed how difficult finalising a deal was likely to be, despite positive remarks from Trump’s vice-president, JD Vance, who said last week there was a “good chance” of agreement. “The recent JD Vance comments got a lot of hares running but things like this show why this deal will be much more complex to agree than lots of people think,” the official said. British ministers presented a draft text of a deal to their US counterparts even before Trump had announced his tariffs. However, the Guardian revealed this week that the agreement does not cover pharmaceutical products. Officials say it will therefore need to be renegotiated, should the president follow through on his promise to target that industry as well. “Our assumptions have had to be reset a few times during this process,” said one Whitehall source, “and they probably will be again.” The Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, speaking in Washington, said he and his colleagues were concerned about the risks to economic growth in the UK from the chaos in the global trading system. “We do have to take very seriously the risk to growth,” he said. “Because the UK is such an open economy, so when we do our modelling … we also have to take into consideration the effect on growth in the rest of the world.” Earlier on Wednesday, official figures underlined the perilous fiscal position the government faces. The Office for National Statistics said borrowing in the financial year ending in March was £151.9bn,more than £20bn higherthan in the previous financial year. Asked about the downbeat figures, which prompted some analysts to reiterate warnings that she may have to raise taxes in her autumn budget, Reeves stressed that her fiscal rules were non-negotiable. “The numbers today just reinforce to me the importance that this government is placing on controlling the public finances,” she said. The chancellor announced welfare cuts and reductions to future Whitehall budgets in herspring statement last monthin order to meet her self-imposed fiscal rules. As Reeves prepared to meet her counterparts from a string of other large economies in Washington, shares on global stock markets were soaring after Trump appeared to indicate a softening of his stance on Chinese tariffs. The US presidentsaid he expectedthat tariffs on China would “come down substantially, but it won’t be zero”. Beijing has been facing 145% tariffs and has hit back with 125% levies of its own. The IMF’s spring meetings in Washington opened on Tuesday with astark warningabout the economic impact of the trade war, which the fund said would prompt a “major negative shock”. Later on Wednesday, Trump said that tariffs on Canadian-made cars “could go up” past 25%, adding: “I really don’t want cars from Canada.”",

    "article_text": "Emergency services were called out to a chemical and gas leak from a lorry inGreater Manchesteron Wednesday. Video footage circulating on social media showed a luminous vapour billowing from a gas tanker HGV in Oldham shortly after 3pm. Firefighters wearing hazmat suits and using specialist equipment worked alongside police and ambulance crews on West End Street to make the vehicle and surrounding area safe, and some nearby businesses and buildings were evacuated. The public were advised by police to avoid the area and keep their doors and windows closed. A spokesperson for Greater Manchester fire and rescue service (GMFRS) said: “At around 3.15pm five fire engines from Ashton, Heywood, Mossley, Rochdale, Bury fire stations plus the incident command unit from Rochdale fire station attended a chemical and gas leak from a HGV on West End Street, Oldham. “Firefighters wearing PPE and using specialist equipment worked alongside partners to make the vehicle and surrounding area safe with some nearby businesses and buildings evacuated while this took place. “The incident has now been scaled down with no wider threat to the public while crews work with partners to decontaminate the affected area so businesses can return to the site. GMFRS are likely to remain in attendance overnight while this work takes place.” A spokesperson for Greater Manchester police said officers were supporting colleagues in the fire service as they carried out work after the incident. “The public are asked to avoid the area, and keep their doors and windows closed if nearby,” the spokesperson added. A firefighter at the scene told the Manchester Evening News the vapour cloud was due to a chemical reaction, adding: “There was a strong acid poured into a truck from a site that deals with cleaning metals. “It’s reacted with the truck and created a vapour cloud which has now dissipated. We are now dealing with the cleanup, crews are blocking drains and containing spills.”",

    "title": "Florida students lobby to keep 2018 gun control law in wake of recent shooting",
    "article_text": "Florida students who were traumatized by the2018 Parkland school shooting– and last week’s deadlyshooting at Florida State University– are urging lawmakers in the Republican-controlled statehouse not to roll back gun restrictions they passed in the wake of the killing at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school. Gun rights activists have been fighting to unravel the2018 lawsince it was passed, including a provision that raised the state’s minimum age to buy a gun to 21. Governor Ron DeSantis and some Republican lawmakers have argued that if an 18-year-old Floridian can serve in the military, they should be able to purchase a firearm. In the wake of the FSU shooting, student activists – including some who were in the vicinity of both mass shootings – were walking the halls of the capitol building in Tallahassee, lobbying lawmakers to support gun control policies in the final two weeks of the legislative session, which is scheduled to end on 2 May. “No one should ever have to experience a school shooting – let alone two – just to have to beg lawmakers to care enough to stop the next one,” said Stephanie Horowitz, who was a freshman at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in 2018 and is now a graduate student at FSU. Two people were killed and six others injured in the shooting last Thursday that terrorized FSU’s campus, about a mile from the state capitol. Logan Rubenstein, a 21-year-old junior at FSU, says it could have been much worse, if a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers had not taken action after Parkland. Rubenstein believes gun restrictions passed by theFloridalegislature in 2018 helped prevent the FSU shooter from carrying out more carnage – like what happened at Rubenstein’s high school in Parkland seven years ago. Rubenstein was in eighth grade at nearby Coral Springs middle school when a 19-year-old gunman armed with an AR-15-style rifle killed 17 people and injured 17 others at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Investigators say the suspect in the FSU shooting, a 20-year-old student at the university named Phoenix Ikner, armed himself with a handgun that was the former service weapon of his stepmother, a local sheriff’s deputy. Under the state’s current laws, he could not legally buy a rifle from a federally licensed dealer. “The law that we passed after Parkland worked,” Rubenstein said. “Because if he was able to buy an AR-15, body armor and a bump stock and unlimited ammo, how much more deadly would it have been?” About three weeks before the FSU shooting, the Florida house passed a bill that would lower the state’s minimum age to buy a gun to 18. The proposal had stalled in the state senate even before the FSU shooting, and it appears even less likely to advance now. Still, speaking at a rally with student activists on the steps of Florida’s historic old capitol on Wednesday, the Democratic state senator Tina Polsky said she was not letting up. Polsky, whose district includes Parkland, is among the Democrats who have sponsored gun control bills this session that never got a hearing in the capitol, where Republicans hold a supermajority in both chambers. “I am begging them to do something like we did after the horrific Parkland shooting,” Polsky said. “I don’t know if it’s going to happen. But we will continue to fight.”",

    "article_text": "Arda Guler struck the only goal asReal Madrid won 1-0 at Getafeto claw back to within four points of LaLiga leaders Barcelona. The young Turkey international fired in from outside the area midway through the first half on Wednesday as Carlo Ancelotti’s side stayed in title contention afterBarcelona won by the same scoreline at Mallorcaon Tuesday. Archrivals Madrid and Barcelona will meet in the Copa del Rey final in Seville on Saturday, with Kylian Mbappe poised to return from injury for the weekend Clasico – one of two remaining this season. In his absence on the outskirts of Madrid, 18-year-old Brazilian striker Endrick made his first league start as England international Jude Bellingham dropped to the bench. Left-back Fran Garcia twice went close for Madrid, his initial effort palmed away by David Soria before he blasted the rebound high and wide. It wasn’t long before Guler broke the deadlock after Brahim Diaz looked to have wasted the chance. Madrid worked the ball back out to Guler, whose powerful 20-yard drive flashed past Soria despite the Getafe goalkeeper getting a hand to it. Endrick thought he had scored only his second LaLiga goal after being put through by Vinicius Junior, but Soria took the sting out of his shot and Djene cleared off the line. Getafe created opportunities of their own, the best of which fell in the second half to an unmarked Mauro Arambarri, who dragged wide with only Thibaut Courtois to beat. Courtois came to Madrid’s rescue in stoppage time as he smothered inside his six-yard box after Peter and Juanmi tried to force the ball home from close range. Getafe substitute Alvaro Rodriguez, who is on loan from Madrid, nearly snatched an equaliser at the death, but saw his low shot beaten away by Courtois. Inaki Williams fired Athletic Bilbao to a 1-0 home win over Las Palmas earlier on Wednesday to strengthen their chances of direct qualification for next season’s Champions League. The Basque side sit fourth with five games to go, eight points clear of fifth-placed Villarreal, who suffered a 3-0 defeat at Celta Vigo. Bilbao also have a Europa League semifinal against Manchester United to come, and should they win that, they will play the final in their home stadium. Five LaLiga sides qualify for the Champions League this season. Sixth-placed Betis are a point behind Villarreal ahead of their encounter with rock-bottom Valladolid on Thursday. A fifth-minute goal from the elder Williams brother after he turned a defender in the box and side-footed home with the outside of his boot was enough for all three points. Bilbao needed two sharp saves from Spain goalkeeper Unai Simon before half-time as relegation-threatened Las Palmas went down fighting.",

    "title": "Arsenal held by Palace to leave Liverpool on brink of Premier League title",
    "article_text": "Liverpool are on the brink of winning the Premier League title after Arsenal were held to a 2-2 draw by Crystal Palace. Arne Slot’s side were watching in anticipation of an Arsenal defeat on Wednesday that would have secured Liverpool’s record-equalling 20th English title. They didn’t get their wish to start the party just yet, but Liverpool look certain to lift the trophy for the first time since 2020 after Jean-Philippe Mateta’s late equaliser for Palace at the Emirates Stadium. Liverpool are 12 points ahead of second-placed Arsenal, who have just four games left and an inferior goal difference of +34 compared with the leaders’ +44. The Reds, who have five matches remaining, will be assured of matching the 20 titles won by bitter rivals Manchester United if they avoid defeat against Tottenham at Anfield on Sunday. While the champagne remains on ice for Slot’s men, it is only a matter of time before Liverpool finish their relentless march to the title after Arsenal’s third draw in their last four league games. Jakub Kiwior put the Gunners ahead early on, but Eberechi Eze equalised for Palace. Leandro Trossard restored Arsenal’s advantage before half-time, only for Mateta to come off the bench and bag a sublime leveller with seven minutes left. Arsenal had delayed Liverpool’s celebrations by routing Ipswich 4-0 on Sunday, when a defeat for the Gunners and a Reds win over Leicester would have ended the title race. Mikel Arteta’s team again kept Liverpool waiting a few days longer, but their real focus was already on Tuesday’s Champions League clash with Paris Saint-Germain. Arsenal will be making their first Champions League last four appearance since 2009, when they host the French club in the first leg. Arteta had insisted he would not rest his stars against Palace with a view to protecting them for the PSG showdown. But he opted to leave Bukayo Saka on the bench after the England winger was left limping by a foul from Ipswich’s Leif Davis last weekend, with Mikel Merino and Ben White not fit to feature. With Palace facing an FA Cup semifinal clash against Aston Villa on Saturday, Oliver Glasner started without key forwards Mateta and Ismaila Sarr. Arsenal looked set to take advantage of Palace’s Wembley distraction when they went in front after just three minutes. It was another success for Arsenal’s set-piece coach Nicolas Jover as they scored from a well-worked dead ball routine for a Premier League leading 16th time this season. Martin Odegaard whipped a free-kick into the Palace area, and Kiwior was left completely unmarked to power his header past Dean Henderson from 12 yards. The Poland defender’s first league goal since February 2024 was almost followed by an immediate Palace equaliser as David Raya saved Daniel Munoz’s volley from an acute angle. So switched on when attacking from set-pieces, Arsenal were caught out from one when Palace equalised in the 27th minute. Adam Wharton picked out the unmarked Eze on the edge of the area, and the England midfielder’s agile volley went in off the post after bouncing past an unsighted Raya. Trossard put Arsenal back ahead in the 42nd minute as the Belgian took Jurrien Timber’s pass and deftly evaded two Palace defenders before clipping a deflected finish into the bottom corner from 12 yards. Arteta took a risk by sending on Saka for the last half an hour, but it was Palace who were on the offensive as Justin Devenny’s header was tipped over by Raya. Henderson made a brilliant save to push Saka’s volley over, and Palace took advantage of that escape to snatch an 83rd-minute equaliser. William Saliba carelessly conceded possession, and Mateta pounced to chip a superb finish over the out-of-position Raya from 30 yards to leave Liverpool within touching distance of the title.",

    "title": "India downgrades Pakistan ties after attack on Kashmir tourists",
    "article_text": "India has announced a raft of measures to downgrade its ties to Pakistan, a day after armed menkilled 26 peoplein the tourist town of Pahalgam in the disputed region Kashmir. Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri told a media briefing on Wednesday that the cross-border linkages of the attack in Indian-administered Kashmir had been “brought out” at a special meeting of the security cabinet, after which it was decided to act against Pakistan. He said the main land border crossing between the two countries would be shut with immediate effect and New Delhi would suspend a water treaty that allows for sharing the waters of the Indus river system between the two countries. He said Pakistani nationals would be barred from travelling to India under the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) visa exemption programme, and that Pakistanis using the visas have 48 hours to leave the country. The defence advisers in the Pakistani high commission in New Delhi were declared persona non grata and asked to leave, Misri said, adding that the overall strength of the Indian high commission in Islamabad will be reduced to 30 from 55. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has called a meeting of the National Security Committee on Thursday morning to respond to the Indian government’s statement, Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar posted on X. A little-known group,the Resistance Front(TRF)claimed responsibilityfor the attack in a social media message, in which it expressed discontent that more than 85,000 “outsiders” had been settled in the region, spurring what it called a “demographic change”. The dead included 25 Indians and one Nepalese national, police said, and at least 17 other people were wounded. Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry said it was “concerned at the loss of tourists’ lives” in Indian-administered Kashmir. “We extend our condolences to the near ones of the deceased and wish the injured a speedy recovery”, the ministry’s spokesperson said in a statement. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi cut short his two-day visit to Saudi Arabia and returned to the capital early on Wednesday. He decried the attack as a “heinous act” and pledged that the attackers “will be brought to justice”. “Their evil agenda will never succeed. Our resolve to fight terrorism is unshakeable and it will get even stronger,” he said in a post on X. India’s Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said, “Those responsible and behind such an act will very soon hear our response, loud and clear.” “We won’t just reach those people who carried out the attack. We will also reach out to those who planned this from behind the scenes on our land,” Singh said in a speech in the capital, New Delhi. Kashmir has seen a spate of deadly attacks, including against migrant workers from Indian states, since New Delhi ended the region’s semi-autonomous status in 2019 and drastically curbed dissent, civil liberties and media freedoms. Tuesday’s attack was a setback for Modi’s government, which has repeatedly made claims of “normalcy” in Kashmir since the region’s semi-autonomous status was revoked. New Delhi has vigorously pushed tourism and the region has drawn millions of visitors to its Himalayan foothills and exquisitely decorated houseboats. Ajai Sahni, executive director of South Asia Terrorism Portal, a platform that tracks and analyses armed attacks in South Asia, said “zero militancy in Kashmir is an impossible objective to realise, at least in the absence of a political solution within the state”. “The normalcy narrative creates a situation where groups are encouraged to engineer attacks,” Sahni said. “There is no normalcy in Kashmir.” Following the attack, panicked tourists started to leave Kashmir. Monojit Debnath, from the eastern Indian city of Kolkata, said Kashmir was undoubtedly beautiful, but his family did not feel secure anymore. “We are tourists, and we should think about what safety we have here for us,” Debnath told the Press Trust of India news agency as he was leaving Srinagar, the region’s main city, with his family. TRF said the “individuals targeted were not ordinary tourists”. “[Instead], they were linked to and affiliated with Indian security agencies,” it said in a separate statement, adding that it would step up its activities in the region. India’s government has not commented on the claim. Attacks by armed groups have afflicted Kashmir, claimed in full but ruled in part by both India and Pakistan, since an anti-Indian rebellion began in 1989. Tens of thousands of people have been killed, although violence has tapered off in recent years.",

    "title": "Trade war with China to hit US healthcare",
    "article_text": "As the United States and China engage in a trade war driven by steep tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump and counter levies by President Xi Xinping, one sector that could be deeply impacted – and in turn have a disproportionate impact on the health of Americans – is pharmaceuticals. The US imports 75 percent of its essential medicines. The Trump administrationhas begun its investigationinto imports of medications and the active ingredients needed to make them, saying a lack of that in the US poses a national security threat. It as also threatened sectoral tariffs – that could range from 7.5 percent to 100 percent – in addition to the 145 percent currently in place on China. While pharmaceuticals have been exempt from Trump’s reciprocal tariffs thus far, it’s not clear how long that will last, especially with potential sectoral levies in the pipeline. In the immediate term, there is some insulation between the looming escalated prices and what consumers will pay when they go to pick up their medication at their local pharmacy. Unlike other goods, pharmaceutical prices for consumers are not subject to the same instantaneous market fluctuations. The complex supply chain across the pharmaceutical industry means that there is a lag between tariffs and the impact they might have on patients. At the same time, there are stockpiles at nearly every step of the supply chain. Wholesalers have their own, as do pharmaceutical giants and even the federal government. “A lot of these medications, especially ones that are, like, in pill forms, are pretty stable for a long time,” Bruce Y Lee, professor of health policy at the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy, told Al Jazeera. In the short term, pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers can eat the spike in costs like they did during the COVID-19 pandemic. That gives pharmaceutical companies and trade groups time to plead with the administration to ensure exceptions from the tariffs continue. India supplies about half of all generic drugs used in the US. However, it depends on China for 80 percent of its active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), the chemical compounds medications are made from. One of the globe’s biggest pharmaceutical giants said it worries any tariff would drive up prices and hurt patient care. In a shareholder meeting, Michel Demare, chairman of the board for AstraZeneca, said, “We still strongly believe that medicines should be exempted from any kind of tariffs because, at the end, it is just harming patients’ health systems and restricting health equity.” AstraZeneca did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for further remarks. Eli Lilly and Johnson and Johnson echoed similar concerns. In the last six months, all three companies have pledged multibillion-dollar investments to ramp up manufacturing as well as research and development in the US. But pharma giants will be able to bite the cost only for so long. Falling stock prices for pharma giants mean that they will need to find other ways to raise the stock price to meet their fiduciary responsibilities to shareholders. Experts say they can do that by renegotiating drug prices higher, depending on the medication. That causes a downstream effect that will lead to higher insurance premiums across the board and higher prices for Americans who rely on these drugs daily. “Demand for many pharmaceuticals is not flexible. This is not a consumer good,” Lee pointed out. “When you impose something that increases the cost, like the tariff, you can’t really change the demand … and will ultimately hurt patients”. According to a report from the supply chain analytics company Exiger released last week, the US relies on China for as much as 80 percent of active pharmaceutical ingredients. For generic antibiotics, in particular, the dependence is much higher at 90 percent. Because China disproportionately produces more generic drugs, which are 80 to 85 percent cheaper than their brand-name alternatives, tariffs on China will hurt low-income communities the hardest. “If there’s a place where you save money, it is generic, and that’s exactly where the increases will be. Generic companies work on the slimmest margins, and they’re just not in a position to absorb [that],” Michael Abrams, partner at Numerof and Associates, a global healthcare consulting firm, told Al Jazeera. Recent analysis from the financial services company ING found that even a 25 percent pharma tariff could force cancer patients to pay as much as $2,000 more for a 24-week supply. Tariffs could force makers of generics to pull out of the US market altogether, says Tom Kraus, vice president of government relations for the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) told Al Jazeera. “Imposing tariffs on medications and their ingredients could force generic drug manufacturers with already slim profit margins to drop out of the US market for a given medication, resulting in drug shortages for American patients,” Kraus said. About 90 percent of the medications prescribed in US pharmacies are generic or biosimilar (meaning ingredients that have similar effects),according to a reportfrom the Association of Accessible Medicines published in February. “It will cause a lot of reverberations throughout because someone’s going to have to pick up the tab. This will result in a smaller percentage of medication costs being covered by insurance companies, and thus this burden pushed to patients and consumers,” Lee added. Americans are already struggling to meet the costs of healthcare as it is. One in three Americans say they cannot take medications they are prescribed because of the cost, and11 percent of Americanssay they cannot meet their healthcare costs, with a higher burden on Hispanic adults at 18 percent overall. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that7.7 percent of Americansare uninsured, meaning their medical costs are out of pocket. Even for those who do have insurance, public health experts believe that insurance premiums will increase if Trump moves ahead with pharmaceutical tariffs. “They’re going to spread that out among anyone paying insurance as a whole. That’s the whole concept of insurance,” Lee said. More expensive drugs are produced stateside or in Europe. Those could also get pricier. There is currently a 10 percent tariff in place impacting these drugs but that could go higher when country-specific tariffs, currently on pause, kick in. Drugs that come out of Europe are more often the blockbuster brand-name medications. Zepbound, Eli Lilly’s weight loss medication, for instance, is made in Ireland. If tariffs kick in there, out-of-pocket costs for US patients on Zepbound could run as much as $1,086.37 for a one-month supply, in contrast to as low as $25 with insurance. In February, the American Hospital Association (AHA), in a letter calling for tariff exceptions for pharmaceuticals, said it is worried that the levies would make existing supply chain strains worse. “Despite ongoing efforts to build the domestic supply chain, the US healthcare system relies significantly on international sources for many drugs and devices needed to both care for patients and protect our healthcare workers. Tariffs, as well as any reaction of the countries on whom such tariffs are imposed, could reduce the availability of these life-saving medications and supplies in the US,” the trade group said in a letter to the White House. “US providers import many cancer and cardiovascular medications, immunosuppressives, antibiotics and combination antibiotics from China. For many patients, even a temporary disruption in their access to these needed medications could put them at significant risk of harm, including death.” The AHA declined Al Jazeera’s request for additional comment. “Healthcare has a very elaborate logistics chain, and obviously, it varies from product to product, but some of them are very complicated,” Abrams of Numerof and Associates added. For instance, some APIs undergo two or three different processes and not all of them are in the same place before they even come to the US to be incorporated into the final product, he explained. “When you take all these relationships and throw them up in the air and see how they come down, inevitably it leads to disruption in supply,” he continued. There are more than 104 active drug shortages in the United States, including common antibiotics like amoxicillin. China is one of the world’s three biggest exporters of the drug, and the US is the largest importer. Another concern about the US’s extreme reliance on China is that the country’s API market is only expected to grow by 7.8 percent over the next five years, according to themarket research firm Modor Intelligence. During the COVID-19 pandemic, when trade essentially halted temporarily, there were concerns that the US did not have enough medications in its strategic reserve to handle a temporary halt. Both Republicans, such as Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton and Democrats, such as former President Joe Biden have long called for less reliance on China for pharmaceuticals as a result. “When you have supply chains that are not well diversified or dependent on just particular channels, then that supply chain is fragile and there’s risk,” Lee said. There have long been suggestions from prominent Chinese voices, including economist Li Daokui, that have called on leadership in Beijing to reduce antibiotic exports to the US as a tool in a trade war. But experts agree that Trump’s rapid approach does not give companies time to prepare and thus is putting patients at risk. The ASHP told the White House in a February letter that tariffs “should be applied selectively and dovetail with other incentives to increase domestic production and promote a stable supply chain”. “You can’t do it in the 18 months that you’re trying to get it done, OK? And it’s not even exactly a four-year undertaking either,” Abrams added. Some companies have said they will bring more pharmaceutical manufacturing jobs stateside. Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche announced a $50bn investment in the US over the next five years, which will include funds to build research and development facilities and expand existing manufacturing operations. Roche follows Novartis, which announced that it would invest $23bn over the next five years to expand its US infrastructure. That includes thousands of new jobs in seven facilities that will manufacture drugs and APIs. But building and getting plants like these in production will not solve the immediate issue, according to ASHP. “It is important to note that building new pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity will take several years. In the meantime, tariffs risk higher prices for those drugs that can pass increased costs to consumers, and shortages for generic drugs that can’t,” Kraus of ASHP continued. The White House did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.",

    "title": "Tunisian judge orders detention of prominent lawyer Ahmed Souab",
    "article_text": "A Tunisian judge has ordered the detention of prominent lawyer Ahmed Souab, a fierce critic of President Kais Saied, lawyers said, two days after his arrest for comments about the judiciary. Souab’s arrest sparked widespread anger among political parties and civil society groups, which said the move was a dangerous escalation of a crackdown on dissent and marked a further entrenchment of the country’s authoritarian regime. Activists took to the streets in protest this week, calling for his release, chanting slogans against Saied and demanding an end to the harassment, silencing and imprisonment of critics. Souab was on the legal defence team in the mass trial last week, in which dozens of defendants, including vocal critics of Saied, were handedjail terms of up to 66 years. The lawyer was arrested on Monday in a police raid on his home in the capital Tunis, after saying before his clients’ sentencing that “knives are not on the necks of detainees, but on the neck of the judge issuing the ruling,” criticising political pressure judges were allegedly under. An anti-terrorism court interpreted the comment as a threat to the judges, but Souab’s lawyers said it was a reference to the huge political pressure on judges. Souab had been detained on “terrorism-related charges” over the comment, a spokesperson for the court said. Souab is a retired administrative judge and lawyer, and a vocal critic of Saied, who has repeatedly said the judiciary had lost its independence. His lawyers boycotted Wednesday’s hearing after the judge informed them that he had accepted the representation of only four lawyers out of the dozens present to defend him. Saeb Souab, the detained lawyer’s son, told journalists that “based on a metaphor, my father is now suspected of terrorism”. Addressing President Saied, his former law professor Saeb Souab said, “This is not the law you taught us.” He called for the release of his father, who he said suffers from heart problems. Since Saied launched a power grab in the summer of 2021, rights advocates and opposition figures have decried a rollback of freedoms in the North African country where the 2011 Arab Spring began. Critics have denounced the recent mass trial as politically motivated and baseless. The defendants faced charges including “conspiracy against state security” and “belonging to a terrorist group”, according to their lawyers. Among those targeted are figures from what was once the biggest party, Ennahdha, such as the leader and former Speaker of ParliamentRached Ghannouchi, former Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi, former Minister of Justice Noureddine Bhiri, and Said Ferjani, a member of the party’s political executive. But the crackdown has also hit many non-Ennahdha figures, including Abir Moussi, a fierce critic of Ennahdha, and Abderrazek Krimi, the project director of the Tunisian Refugee Council. Some of them had been arrested in February 2023, after which Saied labelled them “terrorists”. “The Tunisian court did not give defendants so much as a semblance of a fair trial,” said Bassam Khawaja, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. Tunisia was “making it clear that anyone participating in political opposition or civic activism risks years in prison after a hasty trial without due process”, he added. Several Tunisian legal scholars also denounced in a petition on Tuesday “flagrant violations of all the bases of a fair trial”.",

    "title": "Trump administration considers China tariff cuts: Report",
    "article_text": "The administration of United States President Donald Trump is mulling lowering US tariffs on Chinese goods amid talks with Beijing, the Reuters news agency has reported, citing an unnamed source. No action would be made unilaterally, Reuters reported on Wednesday. The source’s comments followed a report from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) newspaper that the White House is considering cutting its tariffs on Chinese imports in a bid to de-escalate tensions. China tariffs could come down from their current level of 145 percent to between 50 percent and 65 percent, the paper said, citing a White House official. “We are going to have a fair deal with China,” Trump told reporters on Wednesday, but did not address the specifics of the WSJ report. His remarks followed optimistic comments he made on Tuesday that a deal to lower tariffs was possible. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also declined to comment on the WSJ story, but said that he would not be surprised if tariffs went down. Bessent saidboth countries see the current rates as unsustainable, but said he does not know when any negotiations might start. Bessent added that there needs to be a de-escalation before trade talks can proceed. “I think both sides are waiting to speak to the other,” Bessent said. Separate talks between the two countries over tackling the fentanyl epidemic have not yielded results so far, sources say. White House spokesperson Kush Desai said any reports on tariffs were “pure speculation” unless they came directly from Trump. The tariff levels outlined in the Wall Street Journal report would likely still be high enough to deter a significant chunk of trade between the world’s two largest economies. German shipper Hapag-Lloyd said Wednesday that 30 percent of its US-bound shipments from China have been cancelled. China has retaliated with 125 percent tariffson US imports, along with other measures. US stocks extended their early session gains after the report. The market had opened sharply higher on relief among investors after Trump backed away from threats to fire the head of the US Federal Reserve and said a deal with China was possible. The benchmark S&P 500 index was up roughly 3 percent in mid-morning trading. The WSJ reported that discussions remain fluid and several options are on the table. One option would be a tiered approach similar to one proposed by the House of Representatives Committee on China late last year: 35 percent levies for items the US deems not a threat to national security, and at least 100 percent for items deemed as strategic to US interests. That bill proposed phasing in those levies over five years. In addition to the steep tariffs on China, Trump has also imposed a blanket 10 percent tariff on all other US imports and higher duties on steel, aluminium and autos. He has suspended targeted tariffs on dozens of other countries until July 9 and floated additional industry-specific levies on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. That has roiled financial markets and raised fears of global recession. The International Monetary Fund (IMF)said on Wednesdaythat the tariffs will slow growth and push debt higher across the globe. The IMF – which recently released a Global Financial Stability Report – said that US economic growth would be 1.8 percent for the year, a sharp downturn from the 2.7 percent it previously forecasted.",

    "article_text": "Far-right Israeli ministerItamar Ben-Gvirhas claimed that top US Republican lawmakers support bombing “food and aid depots” in Gaza. The statement, made in a social media post on Wednesday, came after the Israeli national security minister said he had met with “senior Republican Party officials at [US President Donald] Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate” in Florida in the United States. “They expressed support for my very clear position on how to act in Gaza and that the food and aid depots should be bombed in order to create military and political pressure to bring our hostages home safely,” Ben-Gvir posted on X in Hebrew. The US president was not at the event, according to his public schedule. Ben-Gvir’s post did not specify which Republicans were in attendance. However, Ben-Gvir’s office told Israeli media that Republican Congressman Tom Emmer, considered to be the third-highest-ranking member of the US House of Representatives, was among the lawmakers present. The Times of Israel and the Jewish News Syndicate were among the news outlets that cited Ben-Gvir’s office in reporting Emmer’s presence, which also appeared to be confirmed by video of the event. The congressman has been one of the leading voices in the US Congress supporting Israel amid thewar in Gaza, and has regularly said that Hamas, and not Israel, was to blame for the high rate of civilian deaths in the Palestinian enclave. A spokesman for Emmer did not reply to a request for comment from Al Jazeera regarding the Mar-a-Lago visit and whether the congressman supported Ben-Gvir’s position on attacking food and aid sites. To date, the Health Ministry in Gaza has said at least 51,300 Palestinians have been killed since the war began in the wake of the October 7 attack by Hamas on southern Israel, during which at least 1,139 people were killed. Ben-Gvir has been one of the leading voices in Israel calling for the escalation of Israel’s assault on Gaza. A resident of an illegal Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank, he has called for the resettlement of Gaza and glowingly endorsed Trump’s plan toforcibly displaceresidents of the Palestinian enclave. He initially resigned from the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in January, in opposition to a temporary ceasefire deal. Before rejoining the government in March, he called for Israel to cut off electricity and water and to bomb aid depots in Gaza as a six-week pause in fighting reached its end. Israeli attacks have continued after military operations resumed on March 18, with 1,928 Palestinians killed since then. While Trump had vowed to end the war upon taking office, a lasting ceasefire agreement has remained elusive. Meanwhile, France, Germany and the United Kingdom condemned on Wednesday the ongoing Israeli blocking of aid, food and medicine entering Gaza. They called the actions “intolerable”.",

    "title": "Trump accuses Ukraine’s Zelenskyy of harming Russia negotiations",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has lashed out at Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accusing the Ukrainian leader of making “very harmful” statements after he pushed back on ceding occupied Crimea to Russia in a potential peace deal. President Zelenskyy on Tuesday ruled out the idea of Ukraine ceding territory to Russia in any deal before talks on Wednesday in London among US, European and Ukrainian officials. “There is nothing to talk about – it is our land, the land of the Ukrainian people,” Zelenskyy said. His comments came after US media reports that the Trump administration was ready to accept recognition of annexed land in Crimea as Russian territory. In a post on the Truth Social platform on Wednesday, Trump accused Zelenskyy of stoking tension by “boasting” that Kyiv would not legally recognise ceding Crimea to Russia. “This statement is very harmful to the Peace Negotiations with Russia,” Trump said, adding that Russia invaded the Crimean Peninsula and annexed it back in 2014 “without a shot being fired”. “It’s inflammatory statements like Zelenskyy’s that makes it so difficult to settle this War,” Trump said. “He can have Peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole Country.” Earlier, US Vice President JD Vance told reporters in India that the US has “issued a very explicit proposal to both the Russians and the Ukrainians”. “It’s time for them to either say ‘yes’, or for the United States to walk away from this process,” he added. Vance said land swaps would be fundamental to any deal. “That means the Ukrainians and the Russians are both going to have to give up some of the territory they currently own,” he added. In London, the US, Ukrainian and European officials held “substantive” truce talks despiteUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio cancelling his trip. Rubio’s no-show on Wednesday prompted a broader meeting with foreign ministers from Ukraine, the UK, France and Germany to be replaced by discussions at an official level, underscoring the tension between Washington, Kyiv and its European allies over Russia’s war in Ukraine. Zelenskyy said the talks had been marked by emotions and expressed hope that future joint work would lead to peace. “Emotions have run high today. But it is good that 5 countries met to bring peace closer,” he wrote on the X social media platform. “The American side shared its vision. Ukraine and other Europeans presented their inputs.” Trump’s Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg said talks with Zelenskyy’s chief of staff Andriy Yermak were positive. “It’s time to move forward on President Trump’s UKR-RU war directive: stop the killing, achieve peace, and put America First,” he said in a statement on X. A spokesperson for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer played down any disappointment over Rubio’s abrupt cancellation, saying the talks involved “substantive technical meetings with European, US and Ukrainian officials on how to stop the fighting” triggered by Russia’s 2022 invasion. “We remain absolutely committed to securing a just and lasting peace in Ukraine, and these talks today are an important part of that,” the spokesperson said. A foreign office spokesperson said “all agreed to continue their close coordination and looked forward to further talks soon.” At the heart of Wednesday’s talks was an attempt to establish what Kyiv can possibly accept after Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff presented proposals that appeared to demand more concessions from Ukraine than Russia. Reuters reported that several sources said Witkoff’s proposals included recognising Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, Washington beginning to lift sanctions on Russia and ruling out Ukrainian membership of NATO. Al Jazeera’s Zein Basravi, reporting from Kyiv, said Ukrainians found the US stance “simply unacceptable”. “Ukraine’s position is that it boggles the mind that … the US would ask an ally to give up sovereign territory of its own after an invasion,” he said. Mattia Nelles, who heads the German-Ukrainian Bureau think tank in Dusseldorf, told Al Jazeera that Europe now finds itself in the position of drawing red lines and trying to prevent Ukraine from being “thrown under the bus”. What was particularly worrisome to Europe was the US position on sanctions. “What the US is also throwing in the mix is sanctions relief, and this is very dangerous because it allows Russia to rearm very quickly while leaving Ukraine in a weaker position,” Nelles said, adding that this would remain unacceptable to both Kyiv and other European nations.",

    "title": "What we know about the funeral of Pope Francis",
    "article_text": "Vatican City –Pope Francis’sfuneral will be held in the Vatican on Saturday at 10am local time (8:00 GMT), with hundreds of thousands of guests and mourners expected to attend the latepontiff’s final ceremonies. US President Donald Trump and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will be among the dozens of dignitaries travelling to the Vatican for the ceremony, which will be a simpler affair than previous papal funerals. Last year,the Argentine popeamended the funeral rites to show that he was a “disciple of Christ” rather than “a powerful man of this world”. As well as being a major religious event, papal funerals also have an important diplomatic dimension. The pope is the head of the Roman Catholic Church, but he also leads the Holy See – a sovereign juridical entity with a seat at the United Nations – and the Vatican city-state. There are some 1.4 billion Catholics worldwide, concentrated above all in Europe, the Americas and increasingly in Africa. For this reason, papal funerals tend to attract large numbers of political figures. When Pope John Paul II died in 2005, his funeral attracted some 70 presidents and prime ministers – making it one of the largest gatherings of world leaders in history. Among those to have already confirmed their attendance for Francis’s funeral on Saturday are US President Trump, the UN chief Guterres, and Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has no plans to attend, according to the Kremlin, but there will be a delegation from China. Alongside these political figures, there will be large numbers of Catholics and other well-wishers. The Italian government said on Tuesday that it expected at least 200,000 foreigners to travel to Rome for the funeral. Although the Vatican is a sovereign state, it is located in the heart of the Italian capital, and Italy will help manage some elements of the logistics. There is, however, some reason to think that the eventual turnout will be higher than the Italian government’s estimate – the last funeral of a sitting pope, John Paul II, attracted some four million attendees. That said, the number of mourners on Saturday might not quite reach that high. While both popes enjoyed high levels of popularity, John Paul had served for 26 years, compared to Francis’s 12. Moreover, John Paul’s native Poland – where he had a huge number of admirers – was close enough to Italy to facilitate large-scale travel. In 2024, Pope Francis simplified the Rite of Burial for Roman Pontiffs, which lays out the rubrics for papal funerals. According to the new rites, Francis will be buried in a single coffin, rather than the three used by previous popes. Different language will be used, too – during the funeral, the pope will be called “Bishop of Rome”, “Pope”, “Pastor”, or “Roman Pontifex”, with grander titles such as “Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church” now avoided. Mirticeli Medeiros, a Catholic Church historian and Vatican correspondent for Brazil’s GloboNews, told Al Jazeera that “Francis’s simplification of the funeral rituals reflects not only his humility, which was well known, but also his revolution of the institution of the papacy”. “He always said that he did not feel comfortable with the idea that the Vatican was the last absolute monarchy of Europe,” Medeiros said. “That is why, from the very beginning, he presented himself as ‘Bishop of Rome’, which for him was the most dignified title – he was a bishop, a pastor and a Christian like any other.” Explaining the changes, Archbishop Diego Ravelli, master of Papal Liturgical Ceremonies, said that the aim was to highlight that the pope’s funeral is “that of a shepherd and disciple of Christ, and not of a powerful man of this world”. Archbishop Ravelli added that it was Francis himself who had stressed the need to “adapt certain rites, so that the celebration of the funeral of the Bishop of Rome might better express the Church’s faith in the risen Christ”. Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, the 91-year-old Italian who is currently dean of the College of Cardinals, is expected to preside over the pope’s funeral mass. He will lead those present in prayers and Bible readings, and will deliver the final commendation and valediction, entrusting the pope’s soul to God. The funeral will be held in a variety of different languages, reflecting the Catholic Church’s international nature and the varied backgrounds of those present. It is likely that – as is the case for most masses of this kind at the Vatican – the main prayers will be said in Latin and Italian, with Bible readings in Italian, Spanish, and English, and a number of shorter prayers in other languages such as Arabic, Polish, and Chinese. After Pope Francis’s funeral, his coffin will be transferred to the Basilica of St Mary Major, a church lying outside the Vatican’s walls that he was particularly fond of visiting. Francis will be the first pope to be buried there since the 1600s, and the first in over 100 years to be buried outside the Vatican. In his final testament, released on Monday, the pope asked that his tomb be “in the ground;simple, without particular ornamentation”, and specified that the only word should be his papal name in Latin: “Franciscus.” A plain gravestone in a church that hasn’t held a pope’s remains in centuries – it’s a fitting final resting place for a man who will be remembered by many for his humility and his independence. “After his election in 2013, the pope first appeared in public wearing simple white vestments, as a way to demonstrate his desire for a less ostentatious church”, Christopher White, Vatican correspondent for National Catholic Reporter, told Al Jazeera. “So,” White added, “it is fitting that he has stripped down the funeral rites, to ensure that in death he can offer one final lesson in symbolism for a church which, he hopes, will continue on a path toward humility.”",

    "title": "‘I don’t know where I will go’: Refugees run out of options in Tunisia",
    "article_text": "Patricia is sobbing over the phone. About a dozen Tunisian policemen came to her camp this morning to tell her and the other refugees, asylum seekers and undocumented migrants living rough in the olive fields outside of Sfax, a coastal city in Tunisia, that they had to leave. They gave them 48 hours. The police didn’t tell them where to go, only that they couldn’t move to any of the 15 or so camps that have grown outside of the city since police first expelled its refugee population inSeptember 2023. Patricia, a nurse, had been working for months from her makeshift clinic at Kilometre 33 – named, like all the temporary settlements outside of Sfax, for its distance from the city. Now she doesn’t know where she, or the old, the infirm, or the children and the nursing mothers who congregate around her clinic, will go. No one has any illusions about what will happen at the end of the deadline. Other camps swept up in the three-week-old police operation to clear the olive fields have been demolished with heavy equipment and burned. Anyone resisting has been arrested. “I don’t know what I will do,” she says. “I don’t know where I will go.” Patricia and others had hoped their camp might be safe. The elders, or “stakeholders”, who settle disputes between camp residents, had contacted security officials, imploring them to spare the relatively quiet Kilometre 33. It hasn’t worked. Now, she must wait for either help or the arrival of the police. A few months ago, she applied to the International Organization for Migration (IOM) to go home to Sierra Leone. She is still waiting for a response. Speaking to Al Jazeera a few days earlier, amid the clamour of her clinic, Patricia had described wanting to be a nurse since she was a girl living with her parents and younger sister in northern Sierra Leone’s Makeni. She remembered her father, a driver for a mobile telephone network, taking her on trips from Makeni to the family’s village, where she would see how other children lived. “I would take water and medicine to the children and tell them how important it was to take their medicine,” she said. “There was a nurse there, Aisha, who I would help. She told my daddy: ‘Watch her. This one will be a nurse.'” Patricia qualified as a nurse and ultimately decided to focus on midwifery. “I’m still a nurse here. I have my licence with me,” she said, describing how she takes her qualifications with her to plead at nearby pharmacies for the medicines she needs to treat others at the settlement. “My daddy was so happy when I graduated [in 2020]. He thought everything was going to be OK. I wanted especially to be a midwife. I liked the deliveries and working with children,” she said. However, Patricia’s world ended on April 22, 2022, when her father was in a car accident. Without the funds to pay for his treatment, the hospital where Patricia had worked for years refused to treat him, simply offering him a bed where, a few days later, he died. A phone call from a friend after her father’s death changed her life’s course. The unnamed man, from her family’s village, had made the journey through Tunisia to Europe seven years ago and was ready to help. Patricia recalled the conversation. “He said: ‘You have nothing, how can you survive?’ and asked me if I would like to go on this journey [to Europe]. I said, I have no money, and he said it was OK. He would pay, but I could not fly. I would have to take transport and walk.” Finding transport to take Patricia through Guinea and Mali was straightforward. But in Algeria, she had to walk. “Sometimes we would walk for days, we had no water. I saw people die. Sometimes my friend would call me and give me courage. He would say: ‘You have to go on.’ But it was so hard.” Eventually, in April 2024, the young woman who had never left her home country crossed into Tunisia and met the smugglers, or “bogan”, who took her to Kilometre 33, then to three failed crossings to Europe and, now, total uncertainty. “[When I arrived] They said we’ll leave tomorrow,” she recalls. “I looked around and saw all the people with no food or shelter, and thought, if they can do it, I can do it for one night.” But “then [a smuggler] brought the plastic [to set up a shelter] and I thought, why do we need this if it’s only for one night?” “The next day, he said the weather was bad … every time, there was an excuse.” More calls were made by Patricia and her friend, and more smugglers were contacted. In June, a little over two months after she arrived, she attempted the first of three failed crossings to Europe. The third, just last month after a second attempt in October, saw her and others reach international waters, only to be pulled back by Tunisian security forces and dumped without phones, money or directions, in the desert. “We were there for 16 days. I often felt like dying. There was no sign of rescue. “All around us were bad people; the police, the Tunisian mafia [robbers who attacked, hoping they had something to steal],” she says. There will not be a fourth crossing, she says. Throughout her time in Tunisia, the authorities have harassed people living in the camps outside Sfax. Now, reportedly under the personal direction of President Kais Saied, they have promised to clear them all, justifying it as a response to Tunisian farmers’ complaints that they are unable to access their olive groves. Announcing the programme in early April, a National Guard spokesperson said camps in the al-Amra and Jebeniana areas, north of Sfax, had already been cleared “peacefully”, with the support of the Red Crescent, the Health Ministry and the Civil Protection agency. About 4,000 people of various nationalities had left one camp, they said, with an unspecified number “dispersed into the countryside” and health authorities taking charge of pregnant women and the infirm. However, none of the refugees Al Jazeera spoke to after the operation knew of any assistance being offered to the vulnerable. Tunisia’s Ministry of the Interior, which oversees both the police and the National Guard, has yet to respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment. “[Authorities are] trying to frame their latest operation, which was accompanied by a propaganda campaign, as … supposedly respecting human rights,” Romdhane Ben Amor, of the Tunisian Forum for Economic and Social Rights (FTDES), said. “It’s unclear how human rights are being respected with bulldozers, heavy machinery and actions like burning the small cloth or plastic tents of migrants,” he said. The current location of many of the people expelled from the camps remains unclear. Al Jazeera spoke to some who say they are still wandering the olive fields, hiding from the police. Ben Amor suspects others have been bussed to the border with Algeria and abandoned in the desert,something that has happened before. The question of where these people may have ended up, or where Patricia may go, has not been posed by the national press, which is more focused on what Ben Amor describes as “propaganda” justifying bulldozing camps. Speaking to a radio station earlier this month, Member of Parliament Tarek Mahdi channelled the president’sclaims that Tunisia was in “imminent danger”, made in February 2023, as “births among migrant women have reached 6,000 births in a short time”. Patricia, on the other hand, just wants to know where she and her patients will sleep in two nights’ time. She cannot face continuing her journey to Europe, and officials have yet to contact her about returning home. “Why do they want to hurt us?” she asked. “We are humans, too. “All that is different is the colour of our skin.”",

    "title": "‘I grabbed my cat and ran’: Istanbul panics as earthquake hits",
    "article_text": "Istanbul, Turkiye –For five terrifying seconds, buildings shook, shelves toppled, and panic rippled through Istanbul, Turkiye’s cultural and economic heart. The ground beneath Istanbul trembled at 12:49pm (09:49 GMT) on Wednesday, sending millions scrambling into the streets as amagnitude 6.2 earthquakestruck in the sea off the city’s western coast. Severalsmaller aftershockshave followed, with magnitudes of between 3.5 and 5.9. No major damage was reported according to authorities, although Istanbul Governor Davut Gul said that at least 151 people were injured after jumping from heights to escape in a panic. The quake, centred near Silivri in the Sea of Marmara, revived painful memories of past disasters and left residents grappling with fear over what might come next. In the upscale Nisantasi district, 69-year-old Bilge was at home when her building suddenly rattled. “People in the building screamed ‘earthquake!’ and ran outside. My hands wouldn’t stop shaking,” she told Al Jazeera, describing crowds spilling onto the sidewalks, clutching phones to check on loved ones. Nearby, coffee shop workers rushed out into the street. “We were just calling our families,” one said, as aftershocks continued to ripple across the city. The earthquake coincided with National Sovereignty and Children’s Day, a public holiday, leading to the cancellation of events and heightened public anxiety. Parents were seen walking through the streets with their children still dressed for celebrations. “I was on the seventh floor, just about to make lunch,” said Zeynep Karatas, 41, a freelance designer from Sisli who had come to Nisantasi’s Macka Park with hundreds of others who wanted the safety of an open space. “The walls in my building cracked, the glasses clinked. I didn’t wait – I grabbed my cat and ran,” said Karatas. She joined dozens of neighbours already gathered outside. Some clutched pets, others their phones, trying to contact relatives. “We all ran out together. Strangers were helping elderly people down the stairs. I felt like crying,” she added. Some in the park are anxious, and say they will stay awake as long as possible at night. Others are planning to pack a small bag in case they need to leave their home quickly. Turkiye’s emergency authority AFAD has warned residents to stay alert, as aftershocks can continue for hours, even days. While initial reports indicated little structural damage, the psychological impact was immediate. “Everyone was talking about 2023,” said Baran Demir, 62, referring to the devastating earthquake thatkilled more than 53,000 peoplein southern Turkiye, and another 6,000 people in Syria. “You could see it on people’s faces, that same fear. My building didn’t collapse then, but the memory came rushing back.” In Nisantasi, 35-year-old cafe worker Mehmet was helping usher customers outside when the aftershocks hit. “Everyone stayed calm, but the mood shifted fast. We just kind of held our breath. We thought this was the big one we’ve been waiting for.” Residents of Istanbul have long feared a major earthquake hitting the city, as has happened in the past. Earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 7 have hit Istanbul in 1509, 1766 and 1894, causing thousands of deaths and large-scale destruction. A 1999 earthquake in Izmit, approximately 100 kilometres (62 miles) east of Istanbul, killed more than 17,000 people. The city lies near the North Anatolian Fault, a major fault line that regularly triggers earthquakes. Improved building codes in recent decades are designed to counteract the effect of earthquakes in the densely populated city, but many are still worried. “I’m scared to sleep tonight,” said Gokhan, an elderly man who lives alone. “What if there are strong aftershocks tonight, I can’t move quickly,” he says with a wry smile. “If it’s my time, it’s my time.”",

    "title": "Jordan outlaws Muslim Brotherhood group, confiscates assets",
    "article_text": "Jordan has imposed a sweeping ban on the Muslim Brotherhood, the country’s most vocal opposition group, after members of the group were found to be linked to a sabotage plot, Minister of the Interior Mazin Fraya said. Police surrounded the party’s headquarters on Wednesday and were searching it. Fraya said all the activities of the group would be banned and anyone promoting its ideology would be held accountable by law. The ban includes publishing anything by the group and the closure and confiscation of all its offices and property, he added. There was no immediate comment from the group, which has operated legally in Jordan for decades and has widespread grassroots support in major urban centres and dozens of offices across the country. The Islamic Action Front (IAF), a political party linked to the regionwide group, won the most seats in parliamentary elections last year against the backdrop of mass protests against Israel over its war on Gaza. In a press conference later on Wednesday, the IAF sought to distance itself from the MB, saying it would continue to operate as a fully independent Jordanian political party with no affiliation to any other entity, and “within the limits of the law”. IAF’s Secretary-General Wael al-Saqqa, speaking at the party’s headquarters in Amman, said the party will work to “defend the interests of the nation and its citizens, to safeguard Jordan’s security and stability, and to engage constructively with national and regional issues”. Jordan banned the Muslim Brotherhood a decade ago but officially licensed a splinter group and continued to tolerate the Islamic Action Front while restricting some of its activities. It was not immediately clear how far the latest ban would go. “It has been proven that members of the group operate in the dark and engage in activities that could destabilise the country,” the Interior Ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. “Members of the dissolved Muslim Brotherhood have tampered with security and national unity, and disrupted security and public order.” It said a son of one of the group’s leaders had joined others in trying to manufacture and test explosives to be used against security forces, without providing names or further details. Last week, Jordan said it hadarrested 16 peopleaccused of manufacturing short-range missiles, possessing explosives and automatic weapons, concealing a ready-to-use missile, and illegally recruiting and training people. The government said the accused belonged to what it called “unlicensed groups,” referring to the Muslim Brotherhood. The group denied the allegations and said it was committed to Jordan’s security. Jordan also attributed a foiled plot in 2024 to Muslim Brotherhood members in Jordan. The group’s members have led some of the largest protests in the region against Israel’s war on Gaza. The group’s opponents say the protests allowed them to increase their popularity. Over the last two years, Jordan has been tightening restrictions on the group, forbidding some of its activities and arresting vocal antigovernment dissenters. International rights groups say that in the last four years, Jordanian authorities have intensified the persecution and harassment of political opponents and citizens using a string of laws to silence critical voices. The Jordanian government says it tolerates public speech that does not incite violence. The Muslim Brotherhood was established in Egypt nearly a century ago and has branches across the world. Its leaders say it renounced violence decades ago and seeks Islamic rule through elections and other peaceful means. Critics, including autocratic governments across the region, view it as a threat.",

    "title": "Is Russia’s Putin ready to stop Ukraine war along current front line?",
    "article_text": "Kyiv, Ukraine –Finishing a cigarette with a final deep puff outside a hospital building in central Kyiv, a wounded Ukrainian drone operator sums up Russian President Vladimir Putin’s readiness to end the Ukraine war along the current front lines. “Don’t trust these leaks, the … vampire is just dragging the talks out,” Arseny, a 31-year-old recovering from a cranial wound that left him blind in one eye, told Al Jazeera while standing near a blossoming apple tree. He referred to aFinancial Timesreport on Tuesday that suggested that Putin could “relinquish” Moscow’s claims on four partly-occupied Ukrainian regions. In September 2022, seven months after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began, Moscow recognised the regions as part of Russia even though it did not fully control them – and began losing some occupied areas within weeks. In return for the Kremlin’s concession, the US may recognise Crimea, a Black Sea peninsula Moscow annexed in 2014, as part of Russia, and “acknowledge” the Kremlin’s de facto control over the four regions’ occupied parts, the Financial Times claimed, citing officials familiar with the talks. “The grandpa in the bunker wants to fool [US President Donald] Trump and then find an excuse to resume the war,” Arseny, who withheld his name in accordance with the wartime protocol, said, referring to Putin. “We’ve known this imperial tactic for centuries.” The Kremlin’s chief spokesman rejected the report, but fell short of denying details about Crimea’s recognition. “Many fakes are being published these days, including by respectable publications,” Dmitry Peskov told the RIA Novosti news agency on Wednesday. “That’s why one has to listen only to original sources” of information, he said. However, a researcher with Germany’s University of Bremen is confident that the ceasefire along the current front line is a viable option for Putin. “Russia doesn’t have resources to continue the war and, moreover, achieve any large-scale conquests,” Nikolay Mitrokhin told Al Jazeera. Western sanctions, a dire shortage of qualified labour, and the Russian economy’s militarisation triggered an abrupt fall in production in many industries, he said. “For Putin, Washington’s recognition of Crimea as part of Russia and Ukraine’s refusal to join NATO are a good trophy that [would look] convincing for the public,” he said. The trophy “would nurture further hopes that [the Kremlin] doesn’t have to rush to fulfil so that [Russian forces] can rest, regroup and further act according to the situation”, he said. A deal with the European Union, whose member states overwhelmingly oppose the dismemberment of Ukraine, “could be reached somehow later”, he said. However, Volodymyr Zelenskyy does not seem convinced. “He’s an independent player whose game can thwart the deal,” Mitrokhin said, referring to Ukraine’s president. “But so far, Zelenskyy seems to be in the mood to try and reach a deal.” Putin is ready to formally agree with some of Trump’s demands – only to come up with more demands of his own. “This is double-dealing, Putin’s traditional style,” Volodymyr Fesenko, head of the Penta think tank in Kyiv, told Al Jazeera. “This is an attempt to keep Trump on the hook in negotiations, an attempt to haggle in return for a virtual agreement to cease fire along the front line,” he said. The concession may look like a “formal step” towards Washington’s position. But in fact, Putin wants to get much more, including the immediate lifting of all sanctions the West slapped on Russia since Crimea’s 2014 annexation, Fesenko said. Putin “is dragging Trump into the negotiation process, but on Russia’s terms”, he said. He noted Washington’s readiness to recognise Crimea as a “principal mistake” that caused a crisis in the talks that have been dragging on for months despite Trump’s claim that he could end the war “in 24 hours”. If the White House does not back out of the Crimea conundrum, the talks will stall, Fesenko said. Crimea seems to have indeed become the bone of contention. Zelenskyy said on Tuesday that Kyiv would never recognise the peninsula as part of Russia. His words apparently forced Trump’s special Ukraine envoy Steve Witkoff and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio to refuse to attend peace talks in London that were scheduled for Wednesday. Even though the Ukrainian delegation arrived,London said the talkswith other European and United States officials will not take place. Meanwhile, Moscow is boosting its push along the crescent-shaped front line that stretches more than 1,000 kilometres (620 miles). But military analysts say Moscow simply lacks manpower and weaponry. “They don’t have enough power,” General Lieutenant Ihor Romanenko, former deputy head of the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, told Al Jazeera. He said that Moscow is trying to kick Ukrainian forces out of their toeholds in thewestern Russian regionsof Kursk and Belgorod. Putin also wants to maintain a buffer zone in the northern Ukrainian region of Sumy, where Russia occupied several border towns but failed to advance towards larger cities, Romanenko said. “The task from the top is to reach the [borders of the eastern] Dnipropetrovsk region by May 9,” when Moscow will lavishly celebrate the 80th anniversary of Nazi Germany’s defeat in World War II, Romanenko said. Under Putin, theMay 9 celebrationshave become the focal point of Russia’s political calendar. A Ukrainian political analyst-turned-serviceman thinks that the war will drag on for several more months. “We are sure that by fall or winter we can squeeze serious concessions out of Russia because of economic reasons” such as continuing sanctions, Kirill Sazonov wrote on Telegram. “No four regions, no official recognition of occupied areas, the termination of hostilities along the front line, foreign peacekeeping contingents to control the ceasefire – and that’s it,” he wrote. Meanwhile, Moscow wants to break Ukraine’s defences to resume its offensive on eastern and southern fronts and then “use their position of power in talks,” he wrote. “The scenario is simple and understandable, the war is going on, the sides didn’t run out of arguments on the battlefield,” Sazonov concluded.",

The Nebula X1 is quiet, bright, and supports two battery-powered surround-sound speakers. byThomas Ricker If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Anker’s new all-in-one Nebula X1 smart projector has everything you’d want from a “cinema-grade outdoor entertainment system.” It produces a bright 4K image from a triple-laser light engine capable of 3,500 ANSI lumens, automatically finds the best place to project an image optimized for the environment, has Google TV built-in to unlock 4K Netflix streams, and features two battery-powered Wi-Fi satellite speakers to create a legitimate surround-sound experience. The only thing missing is a portable screen. The X1 can project a 200-inch image from a distance of 13 to 22 feet thanks to its optical zoom. It’s also fitted with a gimbal that can tilt the output up to 25 degrees to automatically find the best placement on a screen or wall where the image is keystone corrected, focused, and adapted to the ambient light and surface color. A button on the remote control can initiate all that spatial adaptation whenever you want and the X1’s memory feature can preserve settings for repeat locations. And its 5,000:1 native contrast and Rec.2020 color support should help make the X1’s Dolby Vision certification more than just a marketing stunt. It’s the X1’s sound system, however, that’s the real star of this show. The projector includes four built-in speakers (two 15W and two 5W). Those speakers can be combined with a pair of optional battery-powered Wi-Fi speakers good for up to eight hours of audio. Each satellite speaker contains a 40W pair of front drivers, a 20W upward-firing driver, and a 20W side-firing driver to add width and height to audio. The result is a 4.1.2 surround-sound experience when the audio drivers inside the X1 are switched into subwoofer mode. And while the satellite speakers feature IP54 resistance to dust and rain, the X1 projector itself offers no such assurances. Lastly, the X1 is also liquid cooled — an industry first, according to Anker. That not only reduces the size of the unit by omitting the high-powered fans, it also drops the noise to a relatively quiet 26dB. There’s even the option for a two-pack of wireless microphones to get your karaoke on. Anker’sNebula X1won’t come cheap. The projector alone will cost $2,999 starting on May 21st, or $3,298 for the X1 bundle, which includes the projector, two mics, a travel case, and a pair of those satellite speakers.

And unlike Apple Intelligence, Perplexity’s assistant can do these things on older devices, like my iPhone 13 mini. When the Android versionlaunched in January, Perplexity’s spokesperson toldThe Vergethat it would come to iPhones and iPads once “Apple gives us the right permissions,” and apparently that has been worked out. I downloaded Perplexity for the first time on my iPhone today and asked it to set a reminder for me to start cooking at 7PM. I was greeted with a pop-up asking me to give it permission to see my reminders. I accepted, and it added the reminder as I expected. I tried crafting a text message and, as expected, Perplexity asked for access to my contacts. I declined, but I appreciated that the assistant’s next step was to prompt me to just say the intended phone number instead of failing completely. I also tried booking a table at a restaurant, as shown in the video demo posted by Peplexity, and its mobile assistant opened Open Table, then entered the dates and times I said out loud. The actions aren’t end-to-end, though; you’ll still need to complete the process yourself in the window. Perplexity can also open my Uber app and set me up with a ride. Perplexity’s voice assistant has other limitations on iOS. You can’t ask it to look at your camera and “see” what you see for context, as other AI assistants can, likeChatGPTandGrok. But you can still use the standard text-based chatbot to ask questions about a picture. And you can’t ask it to set your iPhone’s scheduled alarms for you — you’ll still need Siri for that.

The dock also features adjustable ambient lighting and a cooling fan so it won’t get too hot to handle. byAndrew Liszewski Anker has announced its first Thunderbolt 5 dock. At roughly 5.2 inches wide and 3.4 inches tall, the Anker Prime TB5 Docking Station is not as compact as some competitors, like CalDigit’sElement 5 Hub. But inside its aluminum alloy housing is an integrated GaN power supply delivering up to 232W of combined power output, so you won’t have to deal with a chunky power brick or a bulky adapter. The Prime TB5 Docking Station has 14 ports, according to Anker, including the SD and microSD memory card slots on the side. Along with those you get two 10Gbps USB-C ports, three 10Gbps USB-A ports, HDMI, DisplayPort, a 2.5Gbps ethernet port, a headphone jack, two downstream USB-C Thunderbolt 5 ports offering up to 120Gbps speeds with aBandwidth Boost option, and an upstream USB-C Thunderbolt 5 port that can deliver up to 140W of power to a host computer. For comparison,CalDigit’s TS5 Plus, the reigning champ of Thunderbolt 5 port offerings, has 20 ports, including three Thunderbolt 5, five USB-C, and five USB-A. TheElement 5 Hubhas 15. The Anker Prime dock can connect up to two 8K displays, although Anker says resolutions and refresh rates may be limited by the host system’s capabilities. The company hasn’t said whether triple-display setups are possible;Cable Matters says its Thunderbolt 5 dockcan be connected to three displays running at 8K/60Hz or 4K/144Hz. Available starting today through Anker’s online store and other retailers for $399.99, the TB5 Docking Station also features a ring of adjustable ambient LED lighting around the top and a U-shaped air duct with a cooling fan that uses an “intelligent temperature algorithm” to prevent overheating and performance loss. Its firmware can also be updated remotely using Anker’s Dock Manager software, making software maintenance easier in facilities with several in use.

    "title": "Perplexity wants to buy Chrome if Google has to sell it",
    "article_text": "But it would rather see Google keep it than sell it to OpenAI. But it would rather see Google keep it than sell it to OpenAI. byLauren Feiner Perplexity Chief Business Officer Dmitry Shevelenko said he didn’t want to testify in a trial about how to resolve Google’s search monopoly because he feared retribution from Google. But after being subpoenaed to appear in court, he seized the moment to pitch a business opportunity for his AI company: buying Chrome. If Judge Amit Mehta sees things the way the Justice Department does,he could force Google to spin out its popular web browser— including the free open source Chromium browser that many other web browsers are built on. Google says this remedy is playing with fire, and could result in a new Chromium owner charging for the product or failing to keep it running in an adequate way, causing ripple effects across the browser industry. But Perplexity would be happy to take on the project, Shevelenko testified. When an attorney asked if Perplexity believes anyone besides Google could run a browser at the scale of Chrome without diminishing its quality or charging for it, Shevelenko responded, “I think we could do it.” It’s not the first time the AI upstart has put its name in the ring to take over a major technology platform under siege by the US government. The less than three-year-old companyalso thinks it could buy TikTok, which is facing an ever-extending ban in the US over national security concerns based on its ownership by China-based ByteDance. Although Shevelenko wasn’t a voluntary witness — he was called by the DOJ to demonstrate how Google’s search monopoly affects new generative AI companies — he seemed prepared to lay out his grievances against Google. He described the “jungle gym” of Android settings a user needs to navigate to set Perplexity as their default AI assistant, and admitted he even had to call on a colleague to help him do it (Shevelenko also admitted he’s a long-time iPhone user). Even once Perplexity’s assistant is set as the default over Google’s on an Android phone, he testified, it still doesn’t have the same standing as Google’s, since a user needs to press a button to activate it, rather than using a wake word like “Hey Google.” Companies under contract with Google essentially have a “gun to [their] head” During the DOJ’s questioning, Shevelenko walked through an anonymized list of phone makers that Perplexity has spoken with about a deal to make it a preloaded search engine or default assistant in the US, but failed to strike a bargain with. In talks with one company whose name was hidden from the public, Shevelenko said the discussion kept “hitting a wall because they were fearful of losing Google revenue share or Google agreements.” As it stands, Shevelenko testified, companies under contract with Google essentially have a “gun to [their] head” because Google can turn off significant revenue share if they do something Google dislikes. Mehta found in the first phase of the case that Google used exclusionary agreements with phone and browser companies to lock up distribution channels, and many of those agreements prevent the companies from making certain kinds of deals that could displace Google’s status on their products. Shevelenko said another unnamed company — which, based onpublic reporting appeared to be Motorola— agreed to preload Perplexity on its devices, but would not make it the default assistant “despite both parties wanting it to be.” He testified that Perplexity and the phone-maker “tried every creative workaround” to evade Google’s restrictions, but even though the company thought Perplexity’s assistant would be “great for their users,” they just couldn’t find a way to “get out of their Google obligations” and dislodge it as the default. Shevelenko credited the judge’s monopoly ruling as the reason it could enter these talks at all. The fact that Google is “under pressure,” he said, is why wireless carriers, phone manufacturers, and browser makers are comfortable even discussing the possibility of a deal. But despite his opportunistic pitch, Shevelenko seemed ambivalent of Google being actually forced to sell Chrome. Ahead of his testimony, he shared a post from the Perplexity teamon LinkedInthat argues Google should not “be broken up.” His company seems more concerned with ending Google’s search distribution agreements. And in court, Shevelenko warned it would be concerning to see a company like OpenAI buy Chrome (as one of its executivestestified Tuesday it would be open to) and discontinue Chromium’s open source model or fail to adequately support the product. “There’s all the self-serving incentive to be here today and shout about how evil Google is, and I think we want to be reasonable,” he said. Google, he continued, builds good products that others are able to iterate on. “We wouldn’t want a remedy that cripples Google’s ability to keep doing that.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

    "title": "Playing Oblivion for the first time is like opening an RPG time capsule",
    "article_text": "﻿Without the benefit of nostalgia, the remaster is a fascinating piece of history that’s not very fun to play ﻿Without the benefit of nostalgia, the remaster is a fascinating piece of history that’s not very fun to play byAsh Parrish It was really great seeing all the excitement from fans whenOblivionshadow dropped earlier this week. For a lot of people, the fourth installment in the Elder Scrolls series isthegame, the experience that either was the impetus for their career in video games, instilled in them an everlasting love for the format, or both. But I never playedOblivionwhen I was younger. It came out in 2006, when I was a freshman in college and firmly within the iron grip of the PS2. (While you partied on Cyrodiil, I studied the keyblade.) I was first introduced to the Elder Scrolls series viaSkyrim, a game that I simply could not get into despite my best efforts and having a partner who loved the game who I wanted to become closer to. When I startedOblivionfor the first time I was so hopeful that it would capture me in a way its successor did not. It did — but not for the reasons I expected. My first surprise came within the game’s opening minutes when I met Emperor Uriel Septim VII. I was shocked. This wasthePatrick Stewart, Captain Picard himself, best friend of Gandalf the Grey. I was surprised yet again when I met Brother Martin; I’d know Sean Bean’s voice anywhere. (And because it’s him,I think I have a major clue as to his inevitable fate.) I tend to think of stunt casting in video games as a much more recent thing. Video games have always been popular and celebrities have always engaged with the medium. (See alsoClair Obscur Expedition 33which came out this weekboasting the voice talents of fellowLord of the Ringsalum Andy Serkis andDaredevilhimself, Charlie Cox.) But having Patrick Stewart show up in your game in 2006 is another level. I wanted to know why and how Bethesda managed this which led me to theMaking of Obliviondocumentary. I love hearing how moments from a developer’s personal history influence a game and it was really cool watchingTodd Howard gush over Terrance Stampand seeing the developers freak out hearing Patrick Stewart voiceOblivion’s opening lines for the first time. It was a special kind of forensic enjoyment I would not have gotten just playing the game itself. When it comes to the game, I like the flexibility of the class system. I prefer ranged combat and I appreciated thatObliviondidn’t shunt me into either a pure archer build or a pure magic build the way other RPGs do (likeDragon Age) and instead gave me the best of both worlds in the monk. I tend to struggle with the “you can be anything” type of games because I need direction. I can’t have too many options because I’ll wind up not picking any of them. WithOblivion, I could make a class that feels good to play and is suited to my particular tastes without getting overwhelmed. I can sling my spells and arrows safely while still being able to mess shit up in melee range because of my Redguard’s affinity for all kinds of weapons. As for the actual gameplay ofOblivionitself, the experience is neither terrible nor great. I know it’s one of those games where its bugginess is part of its charm but I’m not getting any of the funny bugs, just the frustrating ones. I’m playing on Game Pass and during every one of my sessions, the game has crashed. Unreal Engine 5 makes the world look nice but it feels very generic. I understand that seeing Cyrodiil in 2006 was probably groundbreaking and seeing it updated for 2025 inspires a lot of warm, nostalgic feelings. But while I’ve seen this kind of world before in every similar game since, there’s something interesting in knowingOblivionis one of the places where that all came from. Speaking of updated graphics, the NPC faces are truly terrifying. They do look better with all the fancy graphics and textures but all the updates cast them firmly within the unsettling uncanny valley with eyes too small and too icy blue on faces that are way too big. But as I understand it, that’s part ofOblivion’s appeal. Even though playingOblivionis not particularly fun for me, whatisreally fun and fascinating is seeing all the little bits and pieces that I recognize from other games or from games media in general in their proper context. It’s likeThe Simpsons, another thing I did not grow up with that seemingly everyone else did. I’ve seen and used the meme ofHomer disappearing into the busheshundreds of times but it was only this year that I ever sawthe episode in which that happened. It’s like cracking open an RPG time capsule. Even for all its unsavory bits, being able to make the connection betweenOblivionand all the other games it has inspired that I actually do enjoy is really neat. I even think that with more time I could come to enjoy the game as I unravel the Cyrodiilian line of succession and shut all the Oblivion gates. But even if that doesn’t happen, I’ll still enjoy the ride.

    "article_text": "The automaker plans “a comprehensive reimagining” of its brand in October. The automaker plans “a comprehensive reimagining” of its brand in October. byUmar Shakir Lexus’s mid-sized ES luxury sedan is getting a redesign for its eighth generation that includes some edgier styling and a significant platform change that accommodates both an all-electric drivetrain and a regular hybrid one. Revealed at the Shanghai Auto Show today, the 2026 ES is Lexus’ second electric vehicle after the RZ, which was justrefreshedin March. The bolder-looking ES borrows its “spindle” front styling, spicy angles, L-shaped daytime running lights, and swooping rear from theLF-ZC conceptrevealed in 2023 at the Japan Mobility Show. Lexus says it will present “a comprehensive reimagining” of its brand at the show this October. The ES uses a modified version of Toyota’s EV platform called the TNGA GA-K, which includes reinforcements for better stability for both the hybrid or EV versions. It can accommodate a new, lighter-weight 2.5-liter hybrid system that comes with more battery capacity for the 350h model, which now includes an AWD option. The platform can also house a big EV battery on the floor of the FWD 350e and AWD 500e models without making the interior less comfortable, according to Lexus. The company estimates that the ES 350e has 300 miles of range per charge when equipped with 19-inch wheels. Inside the ES, you get a 12.3-inch instrument display and a 14-inch infotainment touchscreen that supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, plus the ability to connect to two smartphones via bluetooth simultaneously. The door panels have a bamboo look made from 3D printed materials and the cabin has ambient lights and Mark Levinson surround sound audio. Lexus plans to launch the new ES before March 2026, including in the US. In the same timeframe, it plans to release another EV, which could be based on an upcoming three-row SUV that parent company Toyota has cookingwhile it works to get more serious about EVs.

    "article_text": "﻿The dual-rubber roller brushes are back, baby. ﻿The dual-rubber roller brushes are back, baby. byJennifer Pattison Tuohy If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. iRobot just launched its ninth new robot vacuum of the year. That’s a record number for the company, which is struggling to dig itself out of thegiant financial holeit was left in afterAmazon’s bid to buy itfell through. The newRoomba Max 705has the same design and lidar navigation as the rest of thenew lineup, and comes with an auto-empty dock and 13,000Pa suction power — the highest advertised on a Roomba. The 705 costs $899.99 (€699) and is available to order now atiRobot.com. Most exciting for pet owners, the 705 brings back Roomba’s excellent dual rubber roller brushes, which are absent from the rest of the new bots. These were a staple of iRobot’s previous range of mid-to-high-end robots, such as the Roomba j9 and theRoomba i5. I have recommendedRoombas for pet ownersspecifically because of these brushes. The nubby rubber rollers, which iRobot claims are anti-tangle and which move in opposite directions, do the best job of any bot I’ve tested at picking up stubborn pet hair from carpet and hard floors. Hopefully, they will be as effective on this redesigned Roomba as they are on the current models. Also good news for pet families: the 705 features iRobot’s excellent AI-powered obstacle detection, which uses an onboard camera to recognize and navigate around objects such as cords and socks, as well as anyunfortunate pet accidents. A dirt-detect feature also uses the camera to identify messy areas it should pay more attention to. The 705 doesn’t have a mop, though, so it can’t tackle muddy paw prints in the same way theCombo 10 Max does. However, based on iRobot’s history, it’s likely we’ll see a combo version of the 705 with a mopping element at some point. Whether that will be dual spinning mop pads like those on the new Roomba 405 and 505, or a retractable mop like the Combo Max 10, or maybeeven a roller mop(which are starting to appear on higher-end robot combos), we’ll have to wait and see. iRobot says the 705 will work with the new Roomba Home app for scheduling, mapping, and control, including features such as room or zone-specific cleaning, four levels of suction power, and repeated cleaning passes. The company says the robot vacuum will beMatter-certifiedand compatible with the Apple Home app later this year. It also works with Amazon Alexa and Google Home for voice and smart home control options.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 23, 2025 / 7:50 PM EDT/ CBS News At the last remaining video store in Pocatello, Idaho, the curtains have closed after more than 30 years, but owner David Kraning found a way to keep a crucial service going for his most loyal customer. Christina Cavanaugh, who hasDown syndromeand is mostly non-verbal, has rented a movie from The Video Stop every day for the past 20 years, often the same titles at the same time each afternoon. \"She doesn't ask for very much, she asks for very little, so when she does express herself, I try and accommodate her,\" said Toni Cavanaugh, Christina's mother. Though Christina's family owns most of the movies she rents, the routine of visiting the store and checking out films is essential to her well-being. \"She'll only watch them if they're from the video store,\" Toni explained with a laugh. \"I think it's comforting.\" When financial realities forced Kraning to close The Video Stop, he faced a dilemma about how to break the news to Christina. \"Last year, just looking at the financials, it wasn't sustainable to try and keep the video store going,\" Kraning said. \"This was one of my first jobs and I remember back in high school, her bringing her daughter in, getting the movies.\" Instead of simply shutting down, Kraning, who also owns the convenience store next door, created \"Christina's Corner\" — a special section with shelving and a display of DVDs designed to look like the video store experience she was accustomed to. \"That somebody would do something so kind, for her specifically like that — he wasn't thinking about anything else except her. That's huge,\" said Toni. Christina still arrives around 3:30 p.m. daily, selects a movie from Christina's Corner, and checks it out herself at the register. Before leaving, she gives a gesture that powerfully communicates her gratitude. Toni says Pocatello has been the ideal community for raising Christina. \"The people here treat her like family — especially Dave and his team, who continue to prioritize her needs despite business challenges,\" she said.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 23, 2025 / 7:13 PM EDT/ AP A dozen states sued the Trump administration in the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York on Wednesday to stop its tariff policy, saying it is unlawful andhas brought chaosto the American economy. The lawsuit saidthe policy put in placeby President Trumphas been subjectto his \"whims rather than the sound exercise of lawful authority.\" It challenged Trump's claim that he could arbitrarily impose tariffs based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The suit asks the court to declarethe tariffsto be illegal, and to block government agencies and its officers from enforcing them. A message sent to the Justice Department for comment was not immediately returned. The states listed as plaintiffs in the lawsuit were Oregon, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York and Vermont. In a release, Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes called Trump's tariff scheme \"insane.\" She said it was \"not only economically reckless — it is illegal.\" Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said, \"Trump's lawless and chaotic tariffs are a massive tax on Connecticut families and a disaster for Connecticut businesses and jobs.\" White House spokesman Kush Desai in response accused Democratic attorneys general of \"prioritizing a witch hunt against President Trump\" and said, \"The Trump Administration remains committed to using its full legal authority to confront the distinct national emergencies our country is currently facing—both the scourge of illegal migration and fentanyl flows across our border and the exploding annual U.S. goods trade deficit.\" The lawsuit maintained that only Congress has the power to impose tariffs and that the president can only invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act when an emergency presents an \"unusual and extraordinary threat\" from abroad. \"By claiming the authority to impose immense and ever-changing tariffs on whatever goods entering the United States he chooses, for whatever reason he finds convenient to declare an emergency, the President has upended the constitutional order and brought chaos to the American economy,\" the lawsuit said. Last week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat,sued the Trump administrationin U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California over the tariff policy, saying his state could lose billions of dollars in revenue as the largest importer in the country. White House spokesperson Kush Desai responded to Newsom's lawsuit, saying the Trump administration \"remains committed to addressing this national emergency that's decimating America's industries and leaving our workers behind with every tool at our disposal, from tariffs to negotiations.\" © 2025 The Associated Press.

Kennedy, Jr. announced Tuesday. The goal is to replace them with natural alternatives in the U.S. food supply. The FDA will be accelerating the review and approval of some new natural color additives, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary told reporters at an event to announce the plan, which stopped short of an outright ban. On \"CBS Mornings\" Wednesday, CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook said the move was significant. \"There have been somesafety issuesthat have been raised, and you have to remember, there's no known nutritional value to these additives, these food dyes,\" he said. \"So you want to be safe not sorry.\" The food dye industry has denied any safety concerns with artificial dyes. The International Association of Color Manufacturers said in a statement after the announcement that artificial dyes are \"essential for consistency, visual appeal, and consumer trust in food products.\" Here's a look at the six dyes being targeted. FD&C Red No. 40, or Red 40 for short, is also known asAllura Red ACin the food industry andE 129in Europe. There are thousands of foods with Red 40, according to databases published by theU.S. Department of AgricultureandEnvironmental Working Group. It can also be found in medications and cosmetics. According to anFDA studypublished in 2016, children are exposed to Red 40 primarily from drinks (likeGatorade Fruit PunchandFanta Soda), cereal (likeKellogg's Froot Loopsand General Mills'Lucky Charms) and frozen desserts (like Turkey Hill'sBlack Raspberry Premium Ice Cream, Breyers'M&M's Minis Caramel Fudge Light Ice Cream, Blue Bell'sBirthday Cake Vanilla Flavored Ice Cream Cupsand Blue Bunny'sStrawberry Flavored Soft Frozen Dairy Dessert). Other beverages that contain Red 40 include severalstrawberry milkbrands and various generic manufacturers ofpink lemonade mixes. The dye can also be found in some candies. In addition to Red 40, Yellow 5 and 6 are themost popular artificial dyesused,according to the Michigan State University Center for Research on Ingredient Safety. Yellow 5 is found inLucky Charms,M&Ms,Skittlesand somecake mixes. It is also found in drinks likeMountain Dew, chips likeDoritosand condiments like Vlasic'ssweet relishand Kraft'screamy French salad dressing. Yellow 6 can be found in many of the same products that contain Yellow 5. It is also found inTrix,Froot Loops,Fanta Soda,Otter Popsand other products. Blue 1 can be found along with other dyes in many multi-colored candies, such asM&MsandSkittles, as well asAirheadsandJolly Ranchers. It can also be found in Pillsbury'sFunfetti Aqua Blue Vanilla Flavored Frosting, YoPlait'sblueberry patchyogurt, berry-flavoredJellomix,MoninandToranibrand blue Curacao syrups, certain energy drinks likeRed Bull Blueand some medications likeProzac. The candy bits in the Pillsbury aqua blue frosting also contain Blue 2 as do other food and drink products. Blue 2, also sometimes labeled as Indigotine or Indigo Carmine, can also be found in other products like soaps, shampoos and even somedog foods. In addition to some food products, certain oral care products like mouthwashes fromColgateandListerineas well as some breath mints include Green 3. Alexander  Tincontributed to this report.

    "title": "Fossil fuel companies caused $28 trillion in climate damage, study finds",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 23, 2025 / 6:40 PM EDT/ CBS/AP Extreme heat caused by emissions from 111 fossil fuel companies cost an estimated $28 trillion between 1991 and 2020, according to researchers at Dartmouth College. Their study, which waspublished Wednesday in \"Nature,\"presents a peer-reviewed method for tying emissions to specific climate harms. Their goal is to help hold companies liable for the cost of extreme weather, similar to holding thetobacco industryliable for lung cancer cases orpharmaceutical companiesliable for the opioid crisis. The research firm Zero Carbon Analytics counts 68 lawsuits filed globally about climate change damage, with more than half of them in the United States. \"We argue that the scientific case for climate liability is closed,\" wrote the study's authors, Christopher Callahan, who received his PhD from Dartmouth College, and Justin Mankin, a Dartmouth Department of Geography professor. About a third of the total cost was attributed to five companies, which can be tied to more than $9 trillion in climate damage, according to the study. These are the top-emitting companies and the dollar amount the researchers estimate they are responsible for: The researchers figured that every 1% of greenhouse gas put into the atmosphere since 1990 has caused $502 billion in damage from heat alone, which doesn't include the costs incurred by other extreme weather such as hurricanes, droughts and floods. Emissions data is taken from the publicCarbon Majors database, they said. They used 1,000 different computer simulations to translate those emissions into changes for Earth's global average surface temperature by comparing it to a world without that company's emissions. Using this approach, they determined that pollution from Chevron, for example, has raised the Earth's temperature by .045 degrees Fahrenheit. The researchers also calculated how much each company's pollution contributed to the five hottest days of the year using 80 more computer simulations and then applying a formula that connects extreme heat intensity to changes in economic output. This system is modeled on the established techniques scientists have been using for more than a decade to attribute extreme weather events, such as the 2021 Pacific Northwest heat wave, to climate change. Mankin said that in the past, there was an argument of, \"Who's to say that it's my molecule of CO2 that's contributed to these damages versus any other one?\" He said the study \"really laid clear how the veil of plausible deniability doesn't exist anymore scientifically. We can actually trace harms back to major emitters.\" Aramco, Gazprom, Chevron, Exxon Mobil and BP did not respond to requests for comment. \"All methods they use are quite robust,\" said Imperial College London climate scientist Friederike Otto, who heads World Weather Attribution, a collection of scientists who try rapid attribution studies to see if specific extreme weather events are worsened by climate change and, if so, by how much. She didn't take part in the study. \"It would be good in my view if this approach would be taken up more by different groups. As with event attribution, the more groups do it, the better the science gets and the better we know what makes a difference and what does not,\" Otto said. So far, no climate liability lawsuit against a major carbon emitter has been successful, but maybe showing \"how overwhelmingly strong the scientific evidence\" is can change that, she said. The research is a good exercise and proof of concept, but there are so many other climate variables that the numbers that Callahan and Mankin came up with are probably a vast underestimate of the damage the companies have really caused, said Michael Mann, a University of Pennsylvania climate scientist who wasn't involved in the study. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "Trading partners play hardball as Trump administration digs in on tariffs",
    "article_text": "The Trump administration's latest efforts to soften its trade stance amid a market rebellion are running into a harsh reality: Other nations do not yet appear willing to negotiate. On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reiterated remarks he'd made to investors at a private conference Tuesday that the tariffs standoff with China was \"unsustainable.\" But he said that any de-escalation would have to be mutual — and had not yet been initiated by the White House. In response, an official with China's U.S. embassy accused the U.S. of continuing to mistreat it. “Our doors are open if the U.S. wants to talk,” the spokesperson said in a statement Wednesday. “If a negotiated solution is what the U.S. truly wants, it should stop threatening and blackmailing China and seek dialogue based on equality, respect and mutual benefit. To keep asking for a deal while exerting extreme pressure is not the right way to deal with China and simply will not work.” Meanwhile, a European Union representative told The Wall Street Journal that it was not going to abandon its value-added tax or the agricultural subsidies its nations provide to the regions farmers. The official also posted to X that the E.U. was seeking to strengthen and expand ties to other nations, indicating it was positioning itself as a counter-weight to the instability set off by the Trump administration. Major stock indexes, as well as bond markets,saw earlier gains evaporate Wednesdayas the day wore on and investors grasped that  the rest of the world was not shifting its hard-line posture. Indeed, the reactions from China and the E.U. may be a response to a sense that it now has leverage. Despite weeks of market turmoil, the White House's new, softer stance appeared to be in response to the threat of physical shortages on U.S. retail shelves — an experience Trump lived through during his first term as the pandemic unfolded. According to a person familiar with the White House's thinking, some companies have stated the tariff rates on imported goods are now so high that they have effectively become embargoes, and the firms have simply stopped bringing in goods in response. The White House was particularly concerned about shortages of products around the holidays, the person said. The Christmas ordering cycle is starting and July Fourth is coming up where retailers might not have the summer products, like beach chairs, umbrellas, grills, fireworks or light-up trinkets. Bessent told a Washington, D.C., conference that “more than 100 countries” have now approached the U.S. to address trade imbalances, though he reasserted a key Trump talking point that the rest of the world, as well as past U.S. presidents, were responsible for harming America’s heartland. “For decades, successive administrations relied on faulty assumptions that our trading partners would implement policies that would drive a balanced global economy,” Bessent said. “Instead, we face the stark reality of large and persistent U.S. deficits as a result of an unfair trading system.” He continued: “Intentional policy choices by other countries have hollowed out America’s manufacturing sector and undermined our critical supply chains, putting our national and economic security at risk.” Bessent's remarks initially sent markets higher. But after Bessent, and later, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, said there would be no unilateral reduction in tariffs against China,stocks pared gains significantly, while U.S. government bonds sold off after an earlier rally. Trump changes-of-mind have been a constant of his second term, and there was nothing to suggest that the latest evolution of his thinking would be final. He was set to make additional remarks Wednesday evening. “With investor concerns growing, U.S. President Trump demonstrated the art of the retreat,” Paul Donovan, chief economist of UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note to clients Wednesday. Donovan added: “The erratic threaten-retreat-threaten-retreat cycle has economic consequences. The uncertainty this causes may impact consumer and business decision-making.”",

    "title": "Tiger Balm faces tariff aches and pains from Trump’s trade war with China",
    "article_text": "Tiger balm, the popular menthol ointment used by athletes and arthritis patients, has just one U.S. distributor and a single factory in China, making it especially vulnerable to the tariff standoff. A 0.63-ounce hexagonal jar of the amber-colored balm typically sells in the U.S. for about $8. But its sole American distributor, Prince of Peace Enterprises, based in Livermore, California, says retail prices could soon rise asPresident Donald Trump hiked up tariffs on China as high as 145%. The ointment for the U.S. markets is produced at a factory in China and, at the current tax rate, the distributor is anticipating $3 million to $5 million in tariff costs this year for Tiger Balm products, said Matt Chin, Prince of Peace president. At least some of that may be passed onto consumers, but not for now. “We’re adopting a more measured approach,” Chin said. “Our customers rely on us, and we want to hold off on raising prices.” Har Paw Corp., a pharmaceutical company based in Singapore, is the headquarters for Tiger Balm products. But the American product comes out of China, and sells more than $30 million worth of the ointment in the U.S annually. Har Paw didn’t respond to requests for comment. The bruising trade war between the U.S. and China is slamming into American businesses that import popular global products for which there areno clear substitutes. Redolent of camphor and menthol, Tiger Balm was first developed in the late 19th century and is used to relieve ailments from muscle aches to colds and headaches. In recent years, the product has found international appeal, gaining endorsement from basketball's Jeremy Lin and pop star Lady Gaga. Trump roiled global markets last month when he imposed punishing reciprocal tariffs on imports from 90 nations, including more than a dozen from Asia. He has since announced a 90-day pause on the additional levies for most countries — while keeping in place a 10% baseline rate — but raised the tax on Chinese imports to 125%. China has retaliated by hiking up tariffs on American goods from 84% to 125%. The current rate for pharmaceutical imports, which form the backbone of Prince of Peace’s inventory, are set at 20%, and they’re exempt from new reciprocal tariffs. But Trump has vowed to impose “major tariffs” on the products soon. Prince and Peace supplies Tiger Balm to chains like CVS and Walmart as well as local pharmacies. Chin said the company has continued to place inventory and absorbed rising tariff costs. So far, there’s been no change in demand because the company hasn’t raised prices. But the challenge is that big box retailers often require price changes to be announced 90 days in advance, Chin said. “If Walmart, for example, won’t make an exception for the price increase due to tariffs, that means as the seller we would have to eat the difference,” he said. Prince of Peace also carries hundreds of ginseng products, herbal teas and other health supplements imported from China that have no Western alternatives. Researchhas shown that tariff costs are borne mostly by U.S. consumers and businesses. New tariffs on China affect about 13% of U.S. imports and may cost consumers up to $25 billion annually, according to areportfrom the center-right economics research nonprofit American Action Forum. In 2018, when Trump implemented sweeping tariffs during his first term, the U.S. lost roughly $7.2 billion in real income. Yan Liang, a professor of economics at Willamette University in Oregon, said specialty goods like Tiger Balm and ginseng don’t compete with U.S. manufacturing and jobs. Rather, they create jobs and revenue in the service sector. “Distributors may have to absorb some of the rising costs so prices don’t have to rise too much to deter consumers,” Liang said. “In both scenarios, these small Chinese American distributors are being squeezed.” Chin is also the president of the Oriental Food Association, which represents more than 40 Asian food importers and distributors in Northern California. He said the group has been engaging with trade representatives and the Chinese consulate in San Francisco for more clarity about the economic outlook of the tariffs. Smaller herbal shops and medicine halls in Chinatowns across the U.S., Chin said, are taking a bigger hit from the tariffs as they run on narrower margins. But he is optimistic that the Chinese American business community will weather the storm, as it did in 2018, when Trump imposed up to 25% tariffs on imported Chinese goods. “It’s definitely a blow to morale,” Chin said, “but we’re strong and will get through these setbacks as a whole.”",

    "title": "The trucking industry hits the brakes with tariffs set to dent imports",
    "article_text": "U.S. trucking is heading for a slowdown, with industry players fearing the “worst is yet to come” as tariffs start to crimp imports. Trucking volumes have plunged to near pre-pandemic levels, according to Craig Fuller, founder of the logistics industry publication FreightWaves. “With imports deteriorating, volumes are expected to fall by another 3-4% over the next month,” Fuller said Tuesday in aposton X, citing the real-time freight data platform Sonar, which he also founded. Fuller said that’s a worrying sign for truckers this year. Container volumes are down 20% at the busy Port of Los Angeles since a year ago,FreightWaves reportedTuesday, saying “this downturn spells trouble” for trucking firms that ship the overseas cargo inland across the country. Freight trucks carrying goods out of the metro area are “converging downward toward 2020 lockdown levels,” the outlet said. The flags come as warning signs pile up for the broader U.S. economy due to President Donald’s Trump’s evolving trade war. The International Monetary Fund on Tuesdayknocked down its forecast for the year, lowering its January projection for global gross domestic product growth to 2.8%, from 3.6% previously. The IMF also cut its outlook for U.S. growth to just 1.8%, down from 2.7%, citing “epistemic uncertainty and policy unpredictability” out of the White House. Fresh GDP data is due out next Wednesday. Freight carriers are “heavily dependent on the health of the U.S. economy, and many industry insiders are waiting on the final outcome of tariffs prior to expressing opinions regarding their outlook,” said John Crum, head of specialty equipment finance at Wells Fargo. Trucks are the nation’s freight mode of choice for everything from grain to gravel, as measured by weight, and also carry the lion’s share, by dollar value, of foodstuffs, electronics and vehicles,federal data shows. Importsaccounted for 40%of freight tonnage moved domestically by truck as of 2023. Despite freight firms’ broader reticence, many are still “expressing caution regarding freight volumes for 2025,” Crum said. In a separate note, Wells Fargo supply chain finance managing director Jeremy Jansen said one silver lining is that companies “have a bit more profit margins than in 2018/19 to absorb some tariff actions.” The growing pessimism comes just months after industry experts were heralding a likely rebound in trucking volumes after two years of declines. Just days before Trump was sworn in to a second term in January, the American Trucking Association released a forecastprojectinga 1.6% boost in freight for the year. “Understanding the trends in our supply chain should be key for policymakers in Washington, in statehouses around the country and wherever decisions are being made that affect trucking and our economy,” ATA President and CEO Chris Spear said in a statement at the time. But in the more than three months since then,consumers’ outlooks have nosedived, executives across industries haveramped up their warningsabout slower sales, andWall Street has swung wildlyin response to ever-shifting signals about the administration’s trade agenda. Small-business owners say they’redoing their best to stockpile inventorybefore steeper tariffs take hold, even as many already get hit with higher bills from suppliers. With much of Trump’s sweeping April 2 slate of tariffs temporarily rolled back, shipping volumes could jump in the second quarter “as consumers scoop up pre-tariff goods before prices go up,” logistics researchers at Cass Information Systemssaid in their March report. “But thereafter, the trade war is likely to extend the for-hire freight recession as higher prices reduce goods affordability and consumers’ real incomes.” Overall U.S. exports rose 4.6% through February, federal researchersreported this month, while imports surged 21.4% as the trade war heated up. The Cass Freight Index fell 5.5% in 2023 and 4.1% last year, “and so far, is trending toward another decline in 2025,” the analytics company said. Mack Trucks recently announced layoffs of hundreds of workers at a Pennsylvania plant due to economic uncertainty, betting on slower demand for its iconic freight vehicles. The decisiondrew sharp criticismlast week from Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, who said, “I fear that we’re going to see more like this” due to tariffs. “We’re going to see more rising prices, more layoffs, more companies not investing in the future.” “The economy has COVID,” Fullerwrotein a follow-up X post on Wednesday, in response to downbeat manufacturing data released this week. “The only cure is a deescalation of the tariffs.”",

    "title": "Columbia University students plan to build tent encampments this week, sources say",
    "article_text": "A group of protesters is planning to set up tent encampments on Columbia University campuses this week in protest of the war in Gaza, according to three people familiar with the planning and a recording of a meeting to plan the action shared with NBC News. The planned encampments come just over a year after students first erected about 50 tents on a university lawn to protest the war and drew the world's attention. Those demonstrations, in part, fueled the Trump administration's effort to extract concessions from Columbia, saying the university failed to quell antisemitism on its campus. Planning for the encampments has been shrouded in secrecy. The coordinating meeting took place at a community center onTuesday night in Brooklyn’s Bushwick neighborhood, approximately 12 miles from campus, according to screenshots of Signal messages from organizers and a person who was at the meeting. Invitations for the meeting were largely distributed in person or verbally over the phone, according to the person who attended the meeting and asked not to be named due to fears of discipline from the school. More than 100 people were present at the gathering and all wore masks to conceal their identities, according to the person. It is unclear if all of the participants were Columbia students, the person said. The student organizers did not introduce speakers by name and instead used Signal usernames and code names — including the beloved Pokémon “Squirtle” and words such as “butterfly” — to distinguish one another, according to the recording. Organizers have also refrained from referring to the upcoming encampments as \"encampments,\" according to screenshots of Signal messages from the organizers and conversations with two people familiar with the planning for the protests. In writing, and verbally, participants have designated the encampments with a code name, the “circus.\" Organizers asked demonstrators not to arrive on campus wearing masks on the days of the protests, which they said could alert campus security officers, according to the recording. “This year feels so much more organized and careful,” the person who was at the meeting said. Columbia did not confirm or deny whether it knew about the upcoming protests. “Our focus is on protecting the safety of our community and ensuring that the University is able to proceed normally with all academic activities,\" a university spokesperson said in a statement. \"We are closely monitoring, as always, for any disruptions, and campus activities are currently proceeding as usual.\" The spokesperson added that encampments are against the university's policies and participation could result in disciplinary action. In a statement, the school's public safety division said it would immediately try to remove tents or other structures, restrict access to the affected areas and possibly implement other restrictions to campus access. Participants will also be told to disperse. \"Individuals who refuse to disperse will be identified and sanctions, including potential removal from campus and possible arrest, may be applied,\" the public safety division said. Students are planning to erect an encampment on Thursday at the university's main campus in Manhattan's Morningside Heights neighborhood and a second encampment on Friday at the university's nearby Manhattanville campus, according to the recording. \"When we take over the lawn, our goal is to unify the space and make it our own,\" one of the organizers said, according to the recording. Thursday’s encampment was planned to start at 1 p.m. on the West Butler Lawn of the university’s main campus, where encampments were set up last year, according to the recording, and disperse before nightfall or before police enter the campus. There will be a second encampment that is expected to be more robust and begin the next day. It is unclear when the Friday encampment will begin, but according to the recording, students plan to stay indefinitely and expect arrests to be made. Organizers chose to stage Friday's encampment at the Manhattanville campus — the site of the university's business school — because it is not gated off to outsiders, unlike the main campus, according to a person who attended the meeting. A speaker at the meeting also said that the site of the second encampment was aimed at protesting the university's gentrification of Harlem, according to the recording. \"Any action that we do will bring police, will bring repression and we thought about that deeply and we're aware of that,\" a speaker at the meeting said to applause. \"And we're stuck in this situation where inaction is also violence.\" Organizers of the upcoming protests have distributed several guidelines, obtained by NBC News, to student protesters. These guidelines cover legal risks associated with protesting, best practices for encounters with law enforcement and strategies for securing their digital presence. The document on digital security advises that students communicate only through encrypted messaging services such as Signal, over the phone, or in person. It also suggests that students turn off Wi-Fi on their phones while protesting to avoid being traced by the university. Another form shared by the organizers and obtained by NBC News asks students to provide \"all the information necessary to support your legal defense\" for their emergency contacts in the event of  arrest. It asks for student protesters to list any medical conditions, insurance information, prescriptions, if they have dependents, where their government IDs are, their address and how emergency contacts can access their apartments or homes. \"Given the Trump Administration’s commitment to pursuing federal action against pro-Palestine protestors and the abduction of our comradeMahmoud Khalil,we are now asking students to prepare not only for potential arrest and jail for several hours or overnight, but for the possibility of prolonged jail time,\" the form reads. \"Give serious thought to the question of how you would prepare for weeks or months in jail.\" The upcoming encampments precede a monthslong campaign of protests at the university last year, which inspired similar demonstrations at college campuses across the country and around the world. Dozens of students who participated in the encampments were arrested by local authorities or expelled from the university. The protests were prompted by the Israeli military’s response to the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terrorist attacks, in which more than 1,200 people were killed and about 250 were taken hostage, according to Israel. More than 51,000 people have been killed in Gaza and millions have been displaced in the war that followed, according to health officials in Gaza. Student activists staged the demonstrations last year in an attempt to get their universities to divest from companies linked to the Israeli government. The encampments also come amid the Trump administration's push to intervene in Columbia's affairs and some of the nation's oldest higher education institutions. The federal governmentcanceled the university’s federal grantson March 7, part of what the Trump administration says is a broader effort to “root out” antisemitism on college campuses. In an effort to restore the grants, which fund dozens of universities' top-tier research expeditions, Columbia agreed to a list of the administration's demands on March 21. The demands included instituting a mask ban at protests in most cases; hiring an outsider to oversee its department of Middle East, South Asian and African studies; committing to \"greater institutional neutrality\"; and enlisting three dozen new security officers with newly installed powers to arrest students. Faced with its own deal by the Trump administration, Harvard University rejected the administration's demands andsued the administrationseveral days later, aiming to restore billions in funding. The protests also come several weeks after federal immigration officialsapprehended at least three Columbia studentswho participated in the student-led protests, including 30-year-oldMahmoud Khalil.",

    "title": "Judge says Trump administration can't move detained Palestinian student out of Vermont",
    "article_text": "A federal judge blocked officials Wednesday from moving a Palestinian student from Columbia University who was taken into custody during his naturalization interview in Vermont. U.S. District Judge Geoffrey W. Crawford extended a previous temporary restraining order that keeps the student, Mohsen Mahdawi, in the state, where he is a resident. Mahdawi is being held at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Vermont. Lawyers for Mahdawi, a pro-Palestinian activist, had filed a motion for his release, arguing that he is not a flight risk. “Mr. Mahdawi has deep community ties, a long history of being actively invested in the peace process, and nearly 80 individuals who can attest to his character,” the filing said. However, Crawford declined to rule whether the federal government can continue to detain Mahdawi, or whether the court has jurisdiction over his habeas petition challenging his detention. The judge set a hearing for next week, at which he could decide to release him. Mahdawi, who was born and raised in a refugee camp in the West Bank and is a U.S. permanent resident, was taken into custody last week by armed agents from the Department of Homeland Security. Mahdawi walked into what he thought was the “final stage” of the long pathway to citizenship, raising his right hand, answering questions and signing a document that “he was willing to defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America,” his attorneys said in court filings. “It was a trap. At approximately 12:00 P.M., the USCIS official informed Mr. Mahdawi that he needed to ‘check’ on some information and would be right back,” the court filings said. “ICE agents, masked and visibly armed, entered the interview room and shackled Mr. Mahdawi.” Following the brief hearing Wednesday, Mahdawi said he did not want his supporters to lose hope and called on people to “believe in the inevitability of justice.” “This hearing is part of the system of democracy; it prevents a tyrant from having unchecked power. I am in prison, but I am not imprisoned,” Mahdawi said in the statement. “A system of democracy guarantees freedom of speech, speaking of Palestine does not only qualify as freedom of speech, but it is also about our humanity. Keep the hope alive; I will see you under the sun.” Mahdawi’s attorney, Cyrus Mehta, accused the Trump Administration of being \"hellbent on detaining these students and treating them like criminals simply for exercising their First Amendment right to freedom of speech.\" “We will continue to fight for Mohsen to be rightfully returned to his community in Vermont,\" Mehta said in a statement. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin did not comment on the temporary restraining order or elaborate on Mahdawi's case. But she said in a statement that it is a “privilege” to be granted a visa or green card. “When you advocate for violence, glorify and support terrorists that relish the killing of Americans, and harass Jews, that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country,” McLaughlin said. The Justice Department declined to comment. In the DHS notice for Mahdawi to appear, officials said Secretary of State Marco Rubio had “determined that your presence and activities in the United States would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences and would compromise a compelling U.S. foreign policy interest,” the court filing said. Mahdawi’s attorneys have said that the government’s actions are retaliatory. “Prior to and following Mr. Mahdawi’s detention, the government has made clear that it intends to retaliate and punish individuals such as Mr. Mahdawi who advocated for ceasefire and ending the bloodshed in Gaza,” their filing said. “Respondents’ actions plainly violate the First Amendment.” Mahdawi grew up in the al-Fara’a refugee camp, where he witnessed Israeli military violence, according to court filings. At 15, the documents said, he was shot in the leg by an Israeli soldier. Mahdawi, who immigrated to the U.S. over a decade ago before attending Columbia University in 2021, became a key organizer of pro-Palestinian protests at the school last year. “He gave speeches at several of these protests. In these speeches, Mr. Mahdawi advocated for respect for international law, a permanent ceasefire, and a peaceful resolution that affirmed the human dignity of all,” the court filings say. While Mahdawi lives in the U.S., much of his family still remains in the refugee camp, and Israeli authorities have repeatedly harassed them because of his advocacy, the filing says. “Mr. Mahdawi is fearful that, if he loses his lawful permanent resident status and he is removed to the West Bank, he will experience the same harassment, detention, and torture that his family has experienced, and would be in even more danger in light of the campaigns that have targeted and spread lies about him,”  the filing said. Mahdawi’s case has prompted widespread criticism of the Trump administration and its stance on free speech. On Monday,Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt.,visited Mahdawi at the ICE facility. “I want to tell everyone that I feel so loved and so supportive, and I am here in good hands,\" Mahdawi told Welch during the meeting. “I am centered, I am clear, I am grounded, and I don’t want you to worry about me. I want you to continue working for the democracy of this country and for humanity.”",

    "title": "Trump says Zelenskyy derailed Ukraine-Russia negotiations, claims a deal was very close",
    "article_text": "LONDON — President Donald Trump slammed Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday, accusing him of derailing negotiations to end the war in Ukraine while a peace deal was “very close.” In along post on Truth Social, Trump described Zelenskyy’s rejection of Russia's takeover of Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014, as “very harmful” to achieving peace. “It’s inflammatory statements like Zelenskyy’s that makes it so difficult to settle this War,” Trump wrote. Zelenskyy has consistently rejected the suggestion that his country give up its claim to the Crimean Peninsula. “There’s nothing to talk about here,” he said at a media conference Tuesday. “This is against our constitution.” During an Oval Office media event Wednesday evening, Trump suggested negotiations with Zelenskyy have been “harder” than dealings with Russian President Vladimir Putin. “We have to get a deal with Zelenskyy,” Trump said. “I thought it might be easier to deal with Zelenskyy. So far, it’s been harder.” Follow live politics coverage here Trump's comments come after months of discord between the two leaders, including a heated exchangein the Oval Office in February. The two men had a near-shouting match when Zelenskyy noted that Russia has broken previous agreements with Ukraine during a disagreement that included Vice President JD Vance. The situation escalated when Trump raised his voice and pointed his finger at Zelenskyy, accusing him of \"gambling with World War III\" and being \"disrespectful\" to the U.S. Trumpordered a pause on military aid,including providing Ukraine with intelligence, following the Oval Office clash. Zelenskyyurged Trump to visit Ukraineearlier this month after Russia launched two ballistic missiles at Sumy, killing 34 people and injuring 119. He suggested that a visit to the destruction would help U.S. leadership \"understand what Putin did.\" High-level talksaimed at bringinga pause to fighting in Ukrainedisintegrated earlier afterSecretary of State Marco Rubioand special envoy Steve Witkoff pulled out, dealing a blow to Kyiv’s hopes for a short-term peace agreement. While ministerial talks that had been planned in London fell apart, Trump’sspecial envoy to Ukraine,Keith Kellogg, still planned to meet with Ukrainian presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak, who arrived in London early Wednesday with the Ukrainian defense and foreign ministers. The parties in London agreed to \"continue the dialogue,\" Yermak said on Telegram following the meeting. \"We conveyed our position and emphasized that an immediate, complete, and unconditional ceasefire must be the first step toward launching negotiations aimed at achieving a just and lasting peace,\" he said. \"We expressed hope that this aligns with the vision of President Donald Trump.\" In a post on X,Zelenskyy commendedthe meeting, though \"emotions have run high.\" \"It’s important that each side was not just a participant but contributed meaningfully. The American side shared its vision. Ukraine and other Europeans presented their inputs,\" Zelenskyy wrote. \"And we hope that it is exactly such joint work that will lead to lasting peace.\" The latest setback comes during a week in which the Trump administration has doubled down on efforts to push Kyiv and Moscow toward a truce. Next week marks 100 days of Trump's second presidential term, and hepromised to end the waron his first day back in office. Rubio suggested last week thatthe United States may walk awayfrom ceasefire efforts, failing any further progress. Vance said earlier in the day that he was “optimistic” about the talks but also doubled down on the threat to walk away from negotiations. “I think that we put together a very fair proposal,” he told reporters on his trip in India. “We’re going to see if the Europeans, the Russians and the Ukrainians are ultimately able to get this thing over the finish line.” Earlier, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that the U.S. has not set a deadline for a ceasefire and that \"Russia does not consider it appropriate to set deadlines either,\" Russian news agency Tass reported. \"The downgrading is significant,\" said Bence Németh, a senior lecturer in the defense studies department at King’s College London, citing Zelenskyy's rejection of Russia's maintaining control of Crimea as part of any deal. Rubio and Witkoff's absence \"suggests that Washington is increasingly disinterested in drawn-out, multilateral negotiations,\" Németh added. \"This is not just about diplomacy fatigue. It also signals a hard pivot: The U.S. is not positioning itself as a neutral mediator.\" State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce confirmed Tuesday that Rubio would skip the meeting hours after saying the opposite. “That is not a statement regarding the meetings. It’s a statement about logistical issues in his schedule,” he said. Despite initial plans to attend the scheduled talks, neither Rubio nor Witkoff were in London on Wednesday, a European diplomat told NBC News. But representatives from the U.K., Germany and France still met with Yermak and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov in what the British Foreign Ministry described as \"productive and successful\" discussions. \"All parties reiterated their strong support for President Trump’s commitment to stopping the killing and achieving a just and lasting peace,\" the ministry said. \"The talks today were productive and successful, and significant progress was made on reaching a common position on next step.\" Expectations that Kyiv and Moscow would make a deal to end theirthree-year warthis week remained low after the U.S. presented Ukraine and its European allies with peace proposals last week in Paris that both sides saw as unacceptable, according to NBC News’ international partner, Sky News. Under a “terms sheet” offered by Rubio and Witkoff, a land-for-peace deal would recognize Russia’s currently illegal annexation of Crimea and work toward lifting European Union sanctions on Russia. Both parties have since rejected the terms. Yulia Svyrydenko, the country’s deputy prime minister, wrote on X that Ukraine was ready to negotiate “but not to surrender.” “Our people will not accept a frozen conflict disguised as peace,” she wrote. After months of upbeat statements on indirect U.S.-led talks, but limited practical engagement,Putin on Tuesdaysuggested for the first time that he would be open to bilateral ceasefire talks withZelenskyy. The issue of Crimea may well be one of the most difficult points of difference to overcome, said Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank. \"I think it will be extraordinarily difficult, bordering on political suicide, for him [Zelenskyy] to commit to paper on things like giving up Crimea,\" Savill said. That said, \"Ukraine is not going to recapture Crimea anytime soon. Ukraine is unlikely to be a NATO member anytime soon.\" \"There might be some formulation [of a deal] that effectively kicks those into the long grass,\" he added, with the caveat that \"the terms of any deal at the moment are not going to be particularly favorable to Ukraine.\"",

    "article_text": "Most internal promotions don’t get this much attention. Most job selection processes don’t have centuries of history behind them — and few, if any, have a special name. But then, most job selections don’t end with a new pope. Catholic cardinals from around the world are converging on Vatican City in advance ofthe conclavethat will elect the successor toPope Francis, who died Monday.Favorites have emerged, and once the conclave begins it likely won’t be long before a new pope is announced, as data shows that conclaves don’t take as long as they used to. Conclaves were first used to elect a popeabout eight centuries ago, with early elections lasting months, even years. It’s been nearly 200 years since a conclave took longer than a week, with modern conclaves typically taking two to three days. The longest conclave of the past 200 years happened in 1831, when it took 51 days to elect Pope Gregory XVI. The longest took place in the 13th century, before conclaves were formalized, when the process that eventually elected Pope Gregory X started in 1268 and ended in 1271. In all, it took two years and nine months,a process that led to the rules and procedures of conclaves. Most popes choose their papal name upon election, a practice that’s been common for the past thousand years. For instance, Argentine Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio chose the name Francis upon being electedin 2013— the first pope to use the name Francis.  By comparison, there have been more than 20 popes with the most common name: John. At the time of his death, Francis was the second-oldest pope in the last 400-some years. Since 1600, more than 30 popes have served. Nine of those, including Francis, were 70 years of age or older when elected. And more than half worked into their 80s — something that’s happening more and more as the average age of popes climbs.",

    "title": "'Star Wars' fans say 'Andor' feels more relevant than ever",
    "article_text": "Warning: This article includes spoilers for the show “Andor.” It takes place a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, but its plotlines seemed pulled right out of today’s headlines. The second season of Disney’s “Andor,” a “Star Wars” series that takes place nearly two decades after the Empire’s rise, has debuted to raves from critics and many fans who have praised its ability to weave together the power critiques of its space opera source material with even more topical subjects like immigration. “This is George Lucas’s dream for Star Wars manifest in its purist form,” Griffin Schiller, a film critic and YouTube host,wrote on X,referring to the franchise’s creator. “Anti-authoritarian art delivered through populist channels.” The new season, which debuted Tuesday on Disney+, focuses on a time when many in the galaxy live in fear of the fascistic Empire. It centers on thief-turned-rebel spy Cassian Andor (Diego Luna), whom fans first meet in the 2016 feature film “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.” In season one, the events on Cassian’s adoptive home planet, Ferrix, help radicalize him, ultimately turning him into a leader within the resistance movement. Season two picks up with Cassian continuing the rebellion efforts as the Empire furthers its agenda. “Andor” creator and showrunner Tony Gilroytold Rotten Tomatoes in a recent interviewthat he studied revolutions throughout history in writing the series. “For me, it was really important that by the time we were done, it was a definitive work about revolution, as many things as I could get in there from all the revolutions I’d read about,” he said. “In season two, we introduce propaganda and the use of media, we introduce large-scaled destruction of a planet, not just colonialism. We also deal with all the factionalism, every revolution you read about has multiple factions that are all fighting the one thing that’s pissing them off. At the end then they’re at each other’s throats.” The focus on those themes has inspired some on social media to see echoes of the current U.S. political landscape, particularly as President Donald Trump’s early second administration facesa growing crowd of critics who say he is headed toward authoritarianism. “Genuinely insane how relevant these political issues in Andor are and it was written before the current presidential administration came into power,”an X user wrote. Ideas about power and rebellion have been central to “Star Wars” ever since its debut in 1977, and Lucas, the creator of the franchise,has said“Star Wars” is antiauthoritarian. But Disney’s efforts to extend Lucas’ universe with various spinoffs has drawn criticism from fans who say some of the titlesdeviate too much from the original trilogy. Some have also said the franchise has gotten “too woke.” Last April,Disney CEO Bob Iger saidthe studio’s job was to “entertain, first and foremost” and “not to advance any kind of agenda.” Much of the negative sentiment toward the franchise appears to have shifted with the release of “Andor,” which has been described assome of the best “Star Wars” storytelling ever. The season two premiere opens with Cassian stealing a prototype TIE fighter from an Empire base with help from an Imperial worker. When she tells him she’s scared of the repercussions of helping the Rebellion, he gives her a rousing pep talk about the why of it all. “The Empire cannot win,” he says. “You’ll never feel right unless you’re doing what you can to stop them. You’re coming home to yourself. You’ve become more than your fear. Let that protect you.” The episode also includes a scene in which Imperial Director Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) leads a secret meeting with a group of high command officers in which he discusses a plan to take over the peaceful planet Ghorman. Gilroy told The Hollywood Reporterthat he took direct inspiration from World War II history for the scene, specifically when the Third Reich plotted its “final solution” at the Wannsee conference in 1942. “The very first scene that Krennic has where he talks about Ghorman, that’s based on the Wannsee convention — the Nazi convention where the Nazis got together and planned the final solution over a business lunch,” Gilroy said. In episode three, imperial troops search for “undocumented” workers who don’t have visas on a planet on the outskirts of the galaxy. It is in this episode that the “Star Wars” franchise also delved into where it has never gone before by including a storyline in which an Imperial lieutenant tries to rape Bix Caleen (Adria Arjona), Cassian’s love interest, who is hiding out with fellow Ferrix refugees on the planet where Imperial forces have landed. “I know you’re illegal; we’ve been counting visas. It’s a tough spot for everyone,” he tells her before implying that if she has sex with him he won’t turn her in. In his original six \"Star Wars\" films, Lucas infused his storytelling with critiques ofthe U.S. war in VietnamandPresident George W. Bush’s administration. Arjonatold Varietythat they shot the episodes a year and a half ago — but that the plot’s relevance to today is not lost on her. “It’s just mirroring that we keep stumbling on the same rock,” she said. “It’s one of my favorite parts about the show. It’s relevant now, and it’s going to be relevant in five years and 10 and 20 and 50 years, because we keep doing the same thing.” Some fans online praised the series for tackling political issues. “Andor Ep1 already has leftist infighting and global supply chain issues We love to see it,”an X user wrote. “the discussion about undocumented immigration and visas in those first three episodes... oh this show is touching on REAL topics”wrote another. The show will drop three new episodes every Tuesday. The finale will be released May 13.",

    "title": "Every NFL team wants a good, young quarterback. Drafting one is the hard part.",
    "article_text": "At this week’s NFL draft, the 32 teams in the world’s most profitable league will be searching for its most valuable commodity: a young, difference-making quarterback. Talent is only part of the appeal as new draftees enter the league on bargain, cost-controlled contracts. In a league in which offenses rely heavily on passing and the highest-paid veteran quarterbacks command $60 million annually, paying a starter a fraction of that amount makes it easier to build a championship-contending roster under the salary cap. Teams devote countless hours and resources toward what amounts to perhaps the highest-pressure job search in professional sports, all in hope of uncovering the next Jalen Hurts, Patrick Mahomes, Joe Burrow or Brock Purdy, each of whom has led his team to a Super Bowl appearance while on a rookie deal since 2019. Yet all the investment in and spotlight on identifying a franchise’s next great quarterback don’t mean teams have gotten any better at picking them. Of the 75 quarterbacks selected in the first round since 2000, 35 earned at least one Pro Bowl appearance. Twenty-one did it multiple times. Just six went on to start and win Super Bowls, and five have been named the NFL’s Most Valuable Player. For every 2004 draft class that produced future franchise cornerstones Philip Rivers, Eli Manning and Ben Roethlisberger, there is also a 2011, when the first round included future MVP Cam Newton but also three other quarterbacks who lasted less than 69 career games apiece. “Player development and quarterback development is circumstantial, and there are different trajectories of development, and how players develop is really impacted by the circumstance and the village surrounding them,” said Scott Pioli, an NFL Network analyst who worked in NFL front offices from 1992 to 2019, including winning three Super Bowls with New England before spending three years as general manager in Kansas City. “Just because someone has immense talent doesn’t mean that they’re being brought into a circumstance or a situation that has all the right people, meaning coaches, front office. They don’t necessarily have the right infrastructure.” That variable makes it impossible to create a foolproof hiring process foranyjob in any NFL franchise, from the general manager to the nutritionist, said a longtime NFL scouting executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preserve relationships within the league. Still, the executive acknowledged that quarterbacks endure a different, and deserved, level of scrutiny. “It’s really hard to put all this on the players. The environment is critical,” the person said. “You’re taking a big, giant step in terms of the ability and talent level of guys that you’re playing against. Combined with less time to practice the things that you need to practice, along with an impatient fan base, impatient owner, impatient everybody, it’s a difficult world all around to really excel in.” Quarterbacks have been sought-after for as long as football has existed, but the 2011 collective bargaining agreement between the NFL and its players union made good, younger starters even more valuable by lowering their cost. As the No. 1 pick in 2010, quarterback Sam Bradford earned $50 million guaranteed on a contract with a maximum value of $86 million. The next year, with new rookie-scale contracts in place, Newton went No. 1 on a deal paying him $22 million over four years. Last year’s No. 1 pick, quarterback Caleb Williams, signed a four-year contract worth $39 million with the Chicago Bears. Purdy is the most recent and extreme example of a low-cost, high-reward draft pick. The 262nd and final pick of the 2022 draft, Purdy earned $870,000 while leading San Francisco to the Super Bowl in his second season — less than many of his starting-QB peers made in just a half of one game,according to ESPN calculations. That kind of potential upside often leads teams to “overdraft” quarterbacks, said Chris Simms, an NBC Sports analyst and former third-round selection at quarterback. A prospect might be ranked 45th among all players on a team’s draft board yet be selected in the top 10 because of what he called a combination of the position’s importance and a team’s desperation. This year’s quarterback draft class could offer a fascinating test case. Though Miami’s Cam Ward is reportedly Tennessee’s target at No. 1, at least one team’s grade of Ward would have made him just the seventh-best QB in last year’s class, and another team didn’t give any of the available quarterbacks a first-round grade, according to ESPN’sAdam Schefter. Seattle Seahawks general manager John Schneidercautioned people in Februaryto be “careful” not to describe this QB class as “weak.” “I think it depends on the team, the player, the quarterback, how you’re going to acquire him, where you’re going to acquire him,” Schneider said. The foundation of a quarterback evaluation in 2025 looks similar to one from 50 years earlier. The first priority, Simms said, is whether a player has the physical tools. To Pioli, arm strength matters, but it isn’t as dependable an indicator as accuracy and decision-making. “You could be really smart at the quarterback position, but can you make a good decision under duress when you’re getting punched in the mouth?” he said. “Those things are very, very different.” Over the decades, however, a data revolution has armed teams with more data than ever about draft prospects. Yet it hasn’t moved them closer to cracking the code of how a particular player will perform in a team’s particular environment, the longtime NFL scout said, because teams can interpret statistics, interviews, background checks and measurements in wildly different ways depending on the preferences or biases of an owner, a general manager or a coach. From 2000 to 2015, 15 quarterbacks drafted in the first round became franchise fixtures, starting at least 100 games in their careers. Yet in the same span, just as many first-rounders played fewer than 60 games. As recently as 2023, when four quarterbacks were taken in the first round, one (Houston’s C.J. Stroud) has become a bona fide starter, while three others have struggled to establish themselves. Some teams lean more heavily on impressions from scouts, while others are driven by analytics departments. Teams can fall into the trap of overanalyzing a player’s performance during the pre-draft process from January to April more than their on-field production. Simms believes an overreliance on analytics “has actually confused people more.” “The great ones have great talent, and they have a charisma about them in the locker room,” Simms said. “We’re talking [John] Elway, [Dan] Marino, Peyton Manning, of course, Tom Brady, [Aaron] Rodgers, to where they can talk to anybody in the locker room and get them to follow and get the energy up on a daily basis in the locker room. And that’s what the great ones have. And I think sometimes that gets lost in translation a little bit with all our other analytical tools we’re talking about.” The longtime NFL scouting executive said, “It always comes back to competitive confidence that I believe I can compete with anybody.” Believing it would lend insights into the NFL draft, Pioli liked to learn how teams in other sports and corporations hired, too. With quarterbacks, he came to believe it was a numbers game. “Smart teams realize, rather than hubris, there’s humility, and they understand that they’re going to get it wrong,” he said. “So you better take as many swings at it as you can.” Pioli was in New England’s draft room in 2000 when the Patriots took arguably the greatest quarterback swing in draft history by selecting Tom Brady with the 199th overall pick. Brady went on, of course, to author the most decorated career of any NFL quarterback. What stood out about Brady? “We had a lot of people involved in the process, but a couple of the things that I do remember coming up consistently was ‘why does it seem that every time that Michigan wins, this is the guy that’s playing quarterback?’” Pioli said. “That was pretty consistent. When Tommy played, they won. And that seems like a very simple thing, but it mattered. “The other thing was a group of people thought he was pretty darn accurate. Everyone that interfaced with him also felt like, you know, his work ethic and his overall makeup as a person was exactly what we wanted in our culture.”",

    "title": "California Bar discloses AI was used to develop some questions in problem-plagued February exam",
    "article_text": "LOS ANGELES — The State Bar of California has disclosed that some multiple-choice questions in a problem-plagued bar exam were developed with the aid of artificial intelligence. The legal licensing body said in anews releaseMonday that it will ask theCalifornia Supreme Courtto adjust test scores for those who took its February bar exam. “The debacle that was the February 2025 bar exam is worse than we imagined,” Mary Basick, assistant dean of academic skills at the University of California, Irvine, Law School,told the Los Angeles Times. “I’m almost speechless. Having the questions drafted by non-lawyers using artificial intelligence is just unbelievable.” In February, the new exam led to complaints after many test-takers were unable to complete their bar exams. The online testing platforms repeatedly crashed before some applicants even started. Others struggled to finish and save essays, experienced screen lags and error messages and could not copy and paste text, the Times reported earlier. According to a recent presentation by the State Bar, 100 of the 171 scored multiple-choice questions were made by Kaplan Exam Services and 48 were drawn from a first-year law students exam. A smaller subset of 23 scored questions were made by ACS Ventures, the State Bar’s psychometrician, and developed with artificial intelligence. “We have confidence in the validity of the (multiple-choice questions) to accurately and fairly assess the legal competence of test-takers,” Leah Wilson, the State Bar’s executive director, told the newspaper in a statement. Katie Moran, an associate professor at the University of San Francisco School of Law who specializes in bar exam preparation, told the newspaper, “It’s a staggering admission.” “The State Bar has admitted they employed a company to have a non-lawyer use AI to draft questions that were given on the actual bar exam,” she said. “They then paid that same company to assess and ultimately approve of the questions on the exam, including the questions the company authored.”",

    "title": "Trump upends DOJ's Civil Rights Division, sparking 'bloodbath' in senior ranks",
    "article_text": "The Trump administration has quietly transformed the Justice Department’sCivil Rights Division, forcing out a majority of career managers and implementing new priorities that current and former officials say abandon a decadeslong mission of enforcing laws that prohibit discrimination in hiring, housing and voting rights. More than a dozen senior lawyers — many with decades of experience working under presidents of both parties — have been reassigned, the current and former officials say. Some have resigned in frustration after they were moved to less desirable roles unrelated to their expertise, according to the sources. “It’s been a complete bloodbath,” said a senior Justice Department lawyer in the division who is not authorized to speak publicly. Last week, President Donald Trump’s hand-picked head of the division issued a series of memos outlining priorities that are dramatically at odds with the way both Republican and Democratic administrations have enforced civil rights law — including the first Trump administration. Rather than focusing on enforcing federal laws against discrimination, the division is now charged with pursuing priorities laid out in a series of Trump’s executive orders, including “Keeping Men out of Women's Sports” and “Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling,” according to the memos, which were issued by division head Harmeet Dhillon and obtained by NBC News. Dhillon is aconservative culture warriorwho represented Trump in challenging the results of the 2020 election and ardently backed his baseless claims of fraud. The changes have not been publicly announced by the Justice Department.Reuters first reportedsome of them Tuesday. “This is a 180 shift from the division’s traditional mission,” said a former senior official in the division who declined to be named in fear of retaliation. \"These documents appear to have been created in a vacuum completely divorced from reality,\" the former official said. \"The division can only enforce statutes that have been passed by Congress, and these orders seem to contemplate division attorneys’ executing on work that fundamentally departs from the division’s long-standing mission.” In a statement, Dhillon portrayed the changes as a normal shift of emphasis in a new administration, as well as a quest for efficiency. “Each new administration has its own priorities, and allocates resources accordingly,\" Dhillon said. \"The Trump administration is no different. When I assumed my duties as Assistant Attorney General, I learned that certain sections in Civil Rights had substantial existing caseloads and backlogs, and that formed the basis of temporary details to assist those sections in getting, and staying, caught up.\" She added: “The Civil Rights Division looks forward to continuing to aggressively protecting the civil rights of Americans.\" NBC News spoke to 10 current and former employees of the Civil Rights Division for this article, as well as other sources familiar with the Justice Department’s operations. Most declined to be identified, citing fear of retaliation. The sources say many of the division’s section chiefs have been transferred to roles unrelated to their legal backgrounds, including in the complaint adjudication office and the office that handles public records requests. “Every presidential administration has its own policy priorities,\" said Stacey Young, who spent 18 years in the division before resigning in January, \"but I don’t think there’s any precedent for an administration almost completely refocusing the civil rights division’s enforcement priorities the way this one has.\" \"The loss is truly hard to quantify,\" added Young, who co-founded Justice Connection, a group now trying to highlight Trump administration changes to the Justice Department. \"Vital civil rights work is not going to get done.\" The overhaul of the Civil Rights Division is a microcosm of what has been happening across the federal government, as the Trump administration hasremoved nonpartisan civil servantsand dismantled orreoriented federal agencieswith a speed and an audacity that few thought was possible. Similar changes have been happening to a lesser degree at other Justice Department offices, current and former officials say. But they say the extent of the repurposing of the Civil Rights Division stands out. Founded in 1957 after the passage of the 20th century’s first major civil rights legislation, the Civil Rights Division has always been subject to the policy preferences of the president, and enforcement priorities tend to differ in Republican and Democratic administrations. But there is no precedent for the changes that have been made over the last three months, which are far more consequential than anything that occurred in Trump’s first term, current and former officials say. “I was there almost 18 years, and what’s happening now is basically the opposite of what we’ve been doing,” said a veteran lawyer who recently left the department. “In the first Trump administration, they engaged with us as attorneys. The political appointees were normal lawyers. Sometimes we persuaded them and sometimes they disagreed, but there was always a conversation about why and what the law required. That is not happening.” In the Biden administration, the Civil Rights Division convicted 180 police officers of violating people’s civil rights, according to Justice Department records. It also prosecuted a variety of high-profile hate crimes cases, including one against the Texas man who targeted Mexicans when he killed 23 people at a Walmart in El Paso and the Pennsylvania man who killed 11 congregants at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. Among the many settlements over racial discrimination, the division secured reforms at Hawkins County Schools in Tennessee, wherean investigation foundthat incidents of harassment — including a mock “slave auction” to sell Black students to their white counterparts and a “monkey of the month” campaign to ridicule Black students — created a racially hostile environment. On voting rights, the divisionsuccessfully challengedan Arizona law requiring people registering to vote to list their birthplaces and provide proof of citizenship. Current and former employees say many of those enforcement actions are unimaginable under the new regime. “They are withdrawing everything we’ve done and taking the opposite side on voting rights, for example,” said a recently departed Civil Division lawyer. “This is not ‘Oh, we want to do more religion cases’ or ‘We don’t want to do creative redlining cases.’ This is abandoning everything that we have done in the past. They are actively anti-civil rights. This didn’t happen in Trump 1.” Dhillon took office April 7, but the changes had already been underway. So far the Civil Rights Division hassuspended investigationsof police abuse and launched probes into whether Los Angeles isviolating people’s gun rightsand whether American universities aretolerating antisemitism. The division was also involved in thelawsuit filed last weekaccusing the state of Maine of violating the law by allowing transgender athletes to participate on women’s sports teams. At the same time, current and former officials say, the managerial jobs vacated in recent weeks have not been filled, so the traditional work of the division has all but stopped. “If regular Americans think that this administration is going to protect their rights, they’re just wrong,\" a recently departed division lawyer said. In theirProject 2025 blueprint, conservative Trump backers wrote that Trump should “reorganize and refocus the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division to serve as the vanguard” for what they called a “return to lawfulness.” “Entities across the private and public sectors in the United States have been besieged in recent years by an unholy alliance of special interests, radicals in government, and the far Left,” they wrote. “This unholy alliance speaks in platitudes about advancing the interests of certain segments of American society, but that advancement comes at the expense of other Americans and in nearly all cases violates long-standing federal law.” Dhillon’s memos, issued last week, laid out a sweeping set of new priorities. The Federal Coordination and Compliance Section, for example, had been tasked with enforcing Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by preventing and remedying discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, religion and shared ancestry in federally funded programs across the country. Dhillon’s memo says the section now has new priorities, not mentioned in the 1964 law but outlined in Trump’s executive orders, including those on “Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism,” “Restoring Merit Based Opportunity” and “Designating English as the Official Language of the United States.” On Tuesday, Attorney General Pam Bondi hosted a meeting of a new Trump administration task force on “Eradicating Anti-Christian Bias.” “The Biden administration engaged in an egregious pattern of targeting peaceful Christians while ignoring violent, anti-Christian offenses,” she said.",

    "title": "A dozen states sue to stop Trump's tariffs",
    "article_text": "Twelve states filed a lawsuit Wednesday challenging the legality of President Donald Trump'sbroad tariff agenda, arguing it unlawfully undermines Congress' constitutional authority to regulate foreign commerce. The legal challenge, led by Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes and Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield, seeks to halt the enforcement of the global tariffs Trump levied that invoked a wartime law granting presidents the power to oversee trade if the United States is in a state of emergency. \"By claiming the authority to impose immense and ever-changing tariffs on whatever goods entering the United States he chooses, for whatever reason he finds convenient to declare an emergency, the President has upended the constitutional order and brought chaos to the American economy,\" said the complaint Democratic attorneys general filed in the U.S. Court of International Trade. Mayes said in a statement announcing the lawsuit, “Trump’s insane tariff scheme is not only economically reckless — it is illegal.” Follow live politics coverage here New York Attorney General Letitia James, a frequent target of Trump's attacks, argued that the tariffs \"will lead to more inflation, unemployment, and economic damage\" and that U.S. consumers will be forced to foot the bill for what amount to high import taxes. In response to a request for comment, White House spokesman Kush Desai said: “Once again, Democrats like Letitia James are prioritizing a witch hunt against President Trump over protecting the safety and wellbeing of their constituents.\" \"The Trump Administration remains committed to using its full legal authority to confront the distinct national emergencies our country is currently facing—both the scourge of illegal migration and fentanyl flows across our border and the exploding annual U.S. goods trade deficit,” Desai added. The lawsuit cites four tariff-focused executive orders signed by Trump. Each one invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a law that grants presidents permission to make trade decisions without congressional approval under declarations of national emergencies. “The purported ‘unusual and extraordinary threat’ identified by President Trump as ‘national emergencies’ do not amount to emergencies. Nor are they extraordinary or even unusual,” the lawsuit says. Without proper emergency justification for using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the lawsuit says, the Trump administration is violating Congress’ “power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises,” as delegated by Article 1 of the Constitution. The Trump administration has sought to justify its recent tariffs on key U.S. trading partners by declaring various emergencies it argued the countries were at fault for causing. The lawsuit comes amid a bipartisan push in Congress to put broad trade authority back in the hands of the legislative branch. Sens. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., and Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who are on the Senate Finance Committee, have co-sponsoreda billthat would require the president to notify Congress 48 hours before imposing new tariffs.",

    "article_text": "Dartmouth College, the only Ivy League university that did not sign a letter condemning the Trump administration for trying to dictate policies and pausing billions of dollars in federal funding, said doing so would not have been an effective way to defend its mission and values. College President Sian Leah Beilock instead wants to focus on the lawsuits the university is already involved in that address pauses in funding for the National Institutes of Health and a new Energy Department policy toreduce the fundingof indirect costs of research grants to 15%, school officials said Wednesday. “President Beilock does not believe that signing open form letters like this one is an effective way to defend Dartmouth’s mission and values,” university spokesperson Kathryn Kennedy said in an email. More than 300 universityand college presidents co-signed Tuesday's letter, which condemns the Trump administration for following through on threats to pause billions of dollars in federal grants and research funding, in part to change schools’ policies and punish them for their handling of student protests.

Last month, many Ivy League universities abruptly stopped hiring faculty members, partly prompted by fear of how the Trump administration’s funding cuts could affect them.

    "article_text": "Welcome to the online version ofFrom the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail. With another Senate Democrat announcing retirement plans, we explore the wave of younger candidates who are looking to replace them. Plus, Andrea Mitchell dives into the collapse of high-level talks to end the Russia-Ukraine war. Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. — Adam Wollner Have a question for the NBC News Politics Desk about the Trump administration’s latest tariff moves, what comes next for the GOP’s big budget bill on Capitol Hill or the early developments of the 2026 midterm elections? Send your questions topoliticsnewsletter@nbcuni.comand we may answer them in a future edition of the newsletter. A growing number of Democrats in the Senate are stepping aside and clearing the way for the next generation of leaders as the party debates its path forward in the Trump 2.0 era. The latest example came Wednesday, when Sen. Dick Durbin, of Illinois, the second-ranking Democrat in the chamber, announced he will not seek re-election in 2026 after having served in Congress for more than four decades,Sahil Kapur, Ben Kamisar and Bridget Bowman report. The decision will set off a scramble for his leadership posts in the Senate — he’s the minority whip and the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee — as well as for his seat in solidly blue Illinois. Already, a bevy of prominent Democrats in the state have signaled their interest in replacing the Durbin, 80. Reps. Lauren Underwood (age 38), Raja Krishnamoorthi (51) and Robin Kelly (68) and Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton (59) are all considering bids, according to sources familiar with their thinking. The winner of the Democratic primary would be a heavy favorite in the general election. Durbin is the fourth Senate Democrat to announce retirement plans ahead ofnext year’s midterm elections, along with Gary Peters of Michigan, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, and Tina Smith of Minnesota, who have similarly seen a wave of younger candidates jump into the races to succeed them. Michigan:The Democratic primary for the seat held by Peters (66) has quickly become crowded. Rep. Haley Stevens (41) isthe latest candidate to jump in, joining state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (38) and former Wayne County health director Abdul El-Sayed (40). It’s expected to be one of the most competitive Democratic primaries in the country next year. And it is likely to lead to one of the most competitive general election matchups, too, with former GOP Rep. Mike Rogers (61) running again after having narrowly lost the Senate race in the state last year. New Hampshire:Rep. Chris Pappas (44) is the early Democratic favorite in the primary to replace Shaheen (78). Minnesota:After Smith (67) announced her retirement, Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan (45) and former state Senate Democratic leader Melisa López Franzen (44) launched their primary campaigns, while Rep. Angie Craig (53) is considering a bid. Those states will be more competitive in a general election than Illinois, so securing the Democratic nomination won’t provide a glide path to the Senate. But the open-seat primaries could pave the way for the sort of youth movement some Democrats have argued is needed to reinvigorate the party ahead of the 2026 and 2028 elections. Side note:Democrats will also aim to defend the youngest member of the Senate next year: 38-year-old Jon Ossoff of Georgia is expected to be Republicans’ top target on the map. U.S. peace talks to end the war in Ukraine appear to be near collapse, with President Donald Trumplashing out atUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for not accepting a U.S. proposal that is widely viewed as favoring Russia. The U.S. plan would let Russia keep Crimea, Ukrainian territory that Russia occupied in 2014, and prevent Ukraine from joining NATO. In a one-two punch, Vice President JD Vance, traveling in India, threatened that the United States would walk away from the talks if the two sides didn’t accept the U.S. terms, which would be a territorial and military victory for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Zelenskyytold The Wall Street Journalthat giving up Crimea would violate Ukraine’s constitution. And he asked what concessions Russia would make if Ukraine gave up hopes of becoming a member of NATO. While Zelenskyy has agreed to a 30-day ceasefire, Russia has not. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff were to hold talks Wednesday with Ukraine, England, Germany and France in London, but Rubio and Witkoff canceled at the last minute. That led European foreign ministers to also drop out, downgrading the talks to a meeting of technical experts. “If at some point we determine that if we’re just too far apart and not enough movement is happening, we may need to move on to other priorities, because there are a lot of important things happening in the world,” Rubio said. “This is not our war. We didn’t start this war.” Trying to smooth over the impasse, Zelenskyy said laterin a statement: “Emotions have run high today. But it is good that 5 countries met to bring peace closer. ... The American side shared its vision. Ukraine and other Europeans presented their inputs. And we hope that it is exactly such joint work that will lead to lasting peace.” The White House says Witkoff will go to Moscow this week for his fourth meeting with Putin. Trump had promised he would end the war within 24 hours of taking office. That’s all From the Politics Desk for now. Today’s newsletter was compiled by Adam Wollner and Bridget Bowman.

    "title": "Dwyane Wade shares the 1 person he took back with him before cancer surgery and why",
    "article_text": "When Dwyane Wade was the most “scared” he’s ever been in his life, there was one person he wanted by his side. The retired Miami Heat legend opened up to Hoda Kotb on the April 23 episode of her“Making Space” podcastabout choosing the one family member he was allowed to have with him before he underwentsurgery for kidney cancerin 2023. “I chose my dad,” Wade said. “He’s the guy, for me. He’s always been. It’s crazy because I’m a mama’s boy, all those things, but my dad has been there.” Wade, 43, has previously shared that he traveled to the hospital that day with his wife,actor Gabrielle Union, and his father, Dwyane Wade Sr. The NBA Hall of Famer told Hoda that only one of them was permitted to be with him before the procedure to remove 40% of his right kidney after doctors had found a cancerous mass on it. “I just thought about actually who I wanted to see in my most vulnerable state,” Wade said. “And it was my dad. I wanted my wife to see me when I woke up, I wanted her to be the first person I saw, but in my most vulnerable state, when I was probably as scared as I’ve ever been, I wanted my dad to be there. I was like, ‘I need my dad.’” Dwyane Wade Sr. also had endured a cancer diagnosis of his own, which further bonded the father and son. “My dad shared with me when he was going through prostate cancer, and I think we got closer through that process because I (was) obviously concerned about him, but we started communicating more because this was something that was a part of our genetic genes as men in our family,” Wade said. “And so we started being able to share personal things,” he continued. “Like, I would call my dad after I left the hospital, like, ‘Yo, I just got a prostate exam, Pops, and the doctor did this,’ and he’ll laugh and say, ‘Oh yeah, that’s nothing. She just wanted to do this.’ We just got close when his prostate cancer (was being treated).” Wadesaid on \"TODAY\" on March 11 that a crucial reason his cancer was detected in the first place was because he went to see his doctor for a checkup in the wake of his father’s prostate cancer diagnosis. It led to further testing in which Wade said his doctors found a 3-centimeter mass on his right kidney that was Stage 1 cancer. It was removed in December 2023 in a surgery during which Wade was accompanied by his father. Dwyane Wade Sr. has been a constant source of strength for his son from the beginning, which included helping him develop a passion for basketball growing up in Chicago. “He channeled his love of sport into his son,” Wade said. “He channeled it into me, and he took me, like, literally everywhere with him. And so I fell in love with sport. I fell in love with competition. I fell in love with camaraderie.” The elder Wade is a military veteran who also instilled a sense of discipline and responsibility in Dwyane Jr. at a young age. “My father would get up every day at 5 a.m., and I would have to get up every day at 5 a.m. with him because he would make me iron his clothes before he went to work,” Wade said. He said he even drove his father to the train station for work when Wade was only 12 years old. “My dad saw something and he was putting something in me and a lot of responsibilities on me,” Wade said. “And so I’ve been getting up at 5 a.m. since I was, like, 9 years old.” “My dad was an amazing father, and he was there,” Wade said later in the podcast. “He showed up. He instilled things in us. Like I said, he was very militant, so a lot of ways that I am, when I say I’m OCD, a lot of that comes from my dad — make your bed, wash the dishes.”",

    "article_text": "By The Associated Press An airplane flies over the container ship Alexandra at the Port Newark Container Terminal on April 18 in Newark, N.J.Julia Demaree Nikhinson/APhide caption NEW YORK — A dozen states sued the Trump administration in the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York on Wednesday to stop its tariff policy, saying it is unlawful and has brought chaos to the American economy. The lawsuit said the policy put in place by President Trump has been subject to his \"whims rather than the sound exercise of lawful authority.\" It challenged Trump's claim that he could arbitrarily impose tariffs based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The suit asks the court to declare the tariffs to be illegal, and to block government agencies and its officers from enforcing them. A message sent to the Justice Department for comment was not immediately returned. The states listed as plaintiffs in the lawsuit were Oregon, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York and Vermont. In a release, Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes called Trump's tariff scheme \"insane.\" She said it was \"not only economically reckless — it is illegal.\" Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said \"Trump's lawless and chaotic tariffs are a massive tax on Connecticut families and a disaster for Connecticut businesses and jobs.\" The lawsuit maintained that only Congress has the power to impose tariffs and that the president can only invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act when an emergency presents an \"unusual and extraordinary threat\" from abroad. \"By claiming the authority to impose immense and ever-changing tariffs on whatever goods entering the United States he chooses, for whatever reason he finds convenient to declare an emergency, the President has upended the constitutional order and brought chaos to the American economy,\" the lawsuit said. Last week,California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, sued the Trump administrationin U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California over the tariff policy, saying his state could lose billions of dollars in revenue as the largest importer in the country. White House spokesperson Kush Desai responded to Newsom's lawsuit, saying the Trump administration \"remains committed to addressing this national emergency that's decimating America's industries and leaving our workers behind with every tool at our disposal, from tariffs to negotiations.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Air pollution still plagues nearly half of Americans. That does a number on our health",
    "article_text": "By Alejandra Borunda A layer of smog lingers above downtown Los Angeles in 2024. Millions of Americans are still breathing in unhealthy air, despite long-term progress toward cleaning up many sources of pollution, according to the 2025 State of the Air report.ETIENNE LAURENT/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption Air in the U.S. has gotten cleaner for decades, adding years to people's lives and preventing millions of asthma attacks, but nearly half of Americans still live with unhealthy air pollution, a new report finds. The report comes as the Trump administration is considering rolling back some key air quality regulations. Air quality across the country has improved dramatically since regulations like the Clean Air Act were put in place in the 1970s to govern sources of pollution like coal-fired power plants and emissions from diesel trucks. Despite that progress, the air is still unhealthy and polluted in many parts of the country. In 2023, nearly half of the country's inhabitants — 156 million people — lived in places heavy in smog or soot pollution that harms their lungs, hearts, and brains, according to the newest edition of the American Lung Association'sState of the Air report. \"Both these types of pollution cause people to die. They shorten life expectancy and drive increases in asthma rates,\" says Mary Rice, a pulmonologist at Harvard University. Pollution levels vary widely across the country, the report finds, with the worst soot pollution, averaged over the whole year, centered on California cities like Fresno and Bakersfield. Ozone pollution is highest in the Los Angeles region. Phoenix, Arizona, and Dallas, Texas, also rank in the top 10 most smog-heavy cities. Nationwide, people of color are about twice as likely to live somewhere with high soot and ozone pollution as white Americans. The report, now in its 26th year, comes as the Trump administration pushes federal agencies to reconsider many of the regulations that have resulted in cleaner air in recent decades.  Environmental Protection Agency administrator Lee Zeldin has announced his intention to re-evaluatelimits on soot pollution, which were last tightened in 2024, claiming the tighter rules restrictbusiness activity. The EPA has grantedexemptions on emissions reduction requirements to dozens of coal-fired power plants, which produce some of the most health-harming particle pollution. Doctors and health experts have expressed alarm at the proposed changes. \"Any rollback of environmental regulations has the potential to have really widespread public health impacts,\" says Neelu Tummula, an ear, nose, and throat physician and a spokesperson for this year's report. \"The U.S. can protect the environment and grow the economy at the same time,\" EPA spokesperson Molly Vaseliou wrote in an email, adding that \"the Trump Administration is taking steps in the right direction to ensure EPA adheres to the agency's core mission of protecting human health and the environment and Powering the Great American Comeback.\" In October of 1948, a thick, choking smog settled over the small Pennsylvania town of Donora. The town was home to two steel plants. Pollution from those plants, likehydrogen fluorideandsulfur dioxide, lingered near ground level for five days. The pollution morphed into a thick, acidic mix that sickened nearly half the town's residents. In the months and years after the smog lifted, scientists figured out that breathing in pollutants from the smog worsened people's respiratory problems and contributed to 20 deaths. Air pollution, they concluded, was far more dangerous than previously thought. Heavy smog blanketed Piccadilly Circus in London, in December 1952. The smog, driven by air pollution from burning coal and unlucky weather conditions, caused thousands of deaths and catalyzed action toward cleaning up sources of pollution. A similar event in the U.S. a few years earlier highlighted the dangers of air pollution on human health.Central Press/Getty Images/Hulton Archivehide caption The incident, along with smog that regularly blanketed cities like Los Angeles, pushed the federal government to develop theClean Air Act, which was first implemented in 1963 and then updated significantly in 1970 and several times since. The law focused on lowering levels of several pollutants known to harm human health: particulate matter (also known as particle pollution), ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and lead. In the years since, study after study has found profound health improvements linked to better air quality. \"The Clean Air Act is one of the greatest success stories in our country,\" says Rice. The law requires that the EPA revisit the science every five years, reassessing what health researchers have learned about the risks of breathing in poor air and adjusting the regulations accordingly. \"So the air quality standards have kept pace with the science over time, and levels of fine particulate matter have declined over the last 50-plus years,\" Rice says. \"As a result, life expectancy is longer, and asthma rates have gone down.\" One landmark study informing the regulations spanned 20 years. TheSix Cities study, led by researchers from Harvard University, followed about 8,000 people who lived in six different U.S. cities—some heavily polluted, like Steubenville, Ohio, and others where air pollution was mild, like Portage, Wisconsin. The scientists measured people's lung physiology at the start of the study and checked in with the participants every year. \"We were not just going into a community, but going into people's homes,\" says Douglas Dockery, one of the leaders of the study and an emeritus professor at Harvard. \"It was real shoe-leather epidemiology.\" They kept track of those who died and of what causes over 20 years. The results, which they published in 1993, were unambiguous. \"People in dirtier communities died sooner than people in clean places,\" says C. Arden Pope, a researcher at Brigham Young University and another author of the study — about two years earlier than a similar person in the cleaner cities. The magnitude of the impact was so large that \"we almost didn't believe it,\" Pope says. In fact, a study published around the same time had investigated the impact on life expectancy from a much more familiar killer: cancer. \"And here we were, saying that the effects of air pollution in the six communities we studied was about that big,\" Pope says. To check the results, Pope led a follow-up study that analyzed health outcomes for more than 500,000 people across the country, in more than 150 cities.That analysiscame to the same conclusion: air pollution shortened people's lives significantly. What Pope found particularly striking was that pollution levels in all six of the original cities studied didn't exceed the pollution limits that existed at the time — yet even at those allegedly \"safe\" levels, people's lives were being prematurely shortened. The outcomes showed that the rules weren't yet tight enough to protect people's health, Pope says. The new research kicked off an effort to strengthen pollution rules. After the two studies were published, the American Lung Association pushed the EPA to tighten thestandard for particle pollution. Scientists have also explored how and why different types of air pollution harm health. Some particles, for example, are so small they can be inhaled deep into people's lungs, where they irritate the organ's delicate lining and trigger respiratory problems, from asthma to COPD. But the problems don't stop in the lungs. The tiniest particles can pass through the lungs' barriers and slip into the bloodstream — \"and from there, anywhere,\" says Tummula. \"They contribute to a lot of inflammation within the bloodstream—but can also disrupt plaque within the arteries,\" she says. Exposure to long-term pollution accelerates thebuildup of plaquein the arteries around the heart, increases the chances ofheart failure and arrhythmias, and increases the likelihood of strokes. Recent research has also found that air pollution directly impacts the brain. Higher exposure to particle pollution is linked to \"problems with cognition and brain function,\" says Wilson. Exposure to high pollution can disrupt children's learning and hasten the onset ofbrain problems like dementia. Since the Clean Air Act first passed, air pollution has dropped by nearly 80% across the country, according to this year's State of the Air report. Cleaner air keeps 2.4 million asthma attacks from happening every year, says Tummula. \"These are each a person we're talking about,\" she says — 2.4 million people every year who can go to school or a full day of work without being interrupted by a health problem. Visitors hold a map showing city landmarks in a clear day as they stand before the Manhattan city skyline during heavy smog brought by wildfire smoke from Canada. Climate change is making wildfires likely to burn more intensely; their smoke is damaging air quality in the U.S. West as well as in parts of the country that have not historically dealt with smoke, like New York City.ED JONES/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption The improvements progressed steadily for years, with soot pollution levels dropping about 40% since 2000, when the SoTA report began its annual roundup. But recently, some of those improvements have plateaued. One major factor, the report says, are climate change-intensified wildfires, which have started burning bigger areas and more intensely. The smoke they produce now impacts parts of the county that historically had little experience with it, like the Midwest and northeastern U.S. Fine particle pollution from wildfire smoke has now eroded about a quarter of air quality improvements since 2000, according to a studypublished in 2023. Climate change is complicating the fight against air pollution in other ways, too, says Rice. For example, ozone, the primary component in smog, forms more readily in hot, sunny weather, and climate change is bringing more hot days to the U.S. A more immediate concern, Rice says, may come from changes in the federal government as the Trump administration makes efforts to cut staffing and spending. Scientists and technicians at the EPA monitor the air and study the health effects of different pollutants. Their work contributes to how regulations on pollution are updated. EPA leaders have proposed eliminating the agency office that performs that research. That would be a \"terrible mistake,\" Rice says. \"We are best equipped to protect our health when we have all the information, like weather and air quality,\" she says. Without it, she worries more people's health will suffer. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

Compounded drugs aren't generics. Rather, they are essentially copies that are allowed to be made by special pharmacies called compounding pharmacies during drug shortages. Tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Lilly's Zepbound and Mounjaro for Type 2 diabetes, was in shortage for two years until Dec. 19, 2024. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration required an end to making the copiesby mid-March, but pharmacies could sell stock already produced until it ran out or expired. And compounders can generally make custom drugs for patients with a doctor's prescription as they do for patients with allergies to certain preservatives in medications, for example. During the Zepbound shortage, compounding pharmacies filled the gap for patients who couldn't find the brand name drug in their pharmacies and patients who didn't have insurance coverage for the drug and couldn't afford Zepbound sticker price of more than $1,086.37 a month. For comparison, compounded tirzepatide sells for as little as $99 a month. Now, the tirzepatide shortage is over and deadlines for producing new copies of tirzepatide have passed, Eli Lilly is cracking down. \"Anyone continuing to sell mass compounded tirzepatide is breaking the law and deceiving patients,\" Lilly said in a company statement sent to NPR. \"We will continue to take action to stop those who threaten patient safety and urgently call on regulators and law enforcement to do the same.\" Eli Lilly filed lawsuits against compounding pharmacies earlier this month. Now, it has turned its attention to telehealth companies selling compounded tirzepatide. On Wednesday, Lilly filed complaints againstMochi Health,Willow Health,Fella Health and Delilah, andHenry Meds. According to one complaint, Mochi allegedly switched its patients to compounded tirzepatide with different additives, likeniacinamide. The complaint also alleges they switched patients over to different doses than those offered by Eli Lilly. These changes were made \"at least five times in just eight months,\" alleges the complaint, to enable Mochi to keep selling compounded tirzepatide. Theexisting law prohibitscompounders from making \"essentially\" a copy of an existing commercially available drug. Mochi representatives did not respond to requests for comment. Lilly's complaint against Henry Meds alleges the telehealth company improperly referenced Lilly's approved drugs and clinical trials on its website in order to sell more compounded versions. Henry Meds and Fella Health are also accused of selling tirzepatide in pill form, which has never been approved by the FDA. \"Fella even tells patients that its untested oral drug is better than Lilly's approved medicines,\" Lilly's complaint against Fella alleges. And the complaint against Willow Health asserts that Willow falsely claimed to have developed the first \"cosmetic\" GLP-1. \"FDA has never approved any form of tirzepatide for cosmetic weight loss,\" Lilly's complaint alleges, adding that Lilly makes the only FDA-approved tirzepatide. Henry Meds, Fella Health and Willow Health did not respond to NPR's requests for comment. On April 1, Eli Lilly sued two compounding pharmacies: Strive and Empower. Strive tells NPR it will fight back, and Empower says in astatement posted to its website, \"We stand by our mission, and the patients and providers who depend on it.\" Scott Brunner, the CEO of the Alliance for Pharmacy Compounding, an advocacy group for compounding pharmacies, declined to comment on the specific suits or companies. However, in an email to NPR, he explained that compounders only produce drugs when a prescriber sends a prescription. \"I fear there is not a bright line on this issue of corporate practice of medicine vs. legitimate customization of a drug based on the judgment of a prescriber who has actually interacted with a patient,\" he wrote. \"FDA guidance clearly authorizes the latter, but the former is to a certain degree in the eye of the beholder. In these new Lilly lawsuits, [it] looks like the beholder will be a Federal judge.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "By Eric Westervelt , Joel Rose A person holds a sign with a photo of Kilmar Abrego Garcia at a protest in New York City.Adam Gray/Getty Imageshide caption WASHINGTON – A federal judge agreed to give the Trump administration another week to answer detailed questions about the illegal deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. A day earlier, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis issued a scathing rebuke of the administration's response to her order for more details about its efforts to return him to the U.S. But the Trump administration asked for more time to respond in the case of the Maryland man who wasdeported to El Salvador last monthin an \"administrative error\" despite court protections. Despite the temporary reprieve, the standoff between the White House and the federal courts may still be heading for a reckoning. In a scathing order Tuesday evening, Judge Xinis accused the Justice Department of willful refusal to comply with her order and attempting to \"obstruct\" discovery after receiving what she characterized as vague and unsatisfying responses to her demand for information on efforts to return Abrego Garcia to the United States. \"Defendants have failed to respond in good faith, and their refusal to do so can only be viewed as willful and intentional noncompliance,\" Xinis wrote. \"That ends now,\" Judge Xinis declared as she rejected the administration's arguments so far as \"specious\" and condemned their \"mischaracterization\" of the Supreme Court's directive to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. In response, Justice Department lawyer Drew Ensign filed a sealed motion on Wednesday requesting a seven-day stay of the judge's directive for the U.S. to provide testimony and documents. The White House continues to insist, without providing solid evidence, that Abrego Garcia is a member of MS-13, the Salvadoran gang that the Trump administration has recently declared a Foreign Terrorist Organization. White House border czar Tom Homan defended the administration's handling of the Abrego Garcia case. \"We removed an MS-13 gang member, public safety threat, wife-beater, designated terrorist from the United States,\" Homan told reporters on Wednesday.\"He's home. He's a citizen of El Salvador, a native of El Salvador who had due process despite what you're hearing.\" Abrego Garcia's lawyers and family strenuously dispute that he's a gang member, saying the allegation is based on flimsy evidence, and note that Abrego Garcia has no criminal record. Judge Xinis said the Trump administration must answer questions about who authorized Abrego Garcia's placement in a Salvadoran prison and provide evidence supporting claims that he belongs to MS-13 – an allegation the judge noted remains unsubstantiated in court.This case has now traveled through three federal courts, including the Supreme Court, whichordered the administrationto \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's release and handle the case as if the improper deportation had never occurred. Yet the Justice Department continues to resist, arguing in court filings that since Abrego Garcia is now in El Salvador's custody, American courtscannot order his return. The administration also says, according to a court filing Tuesday, that it has taken additional steps to comply. But the justice department lawyers have invoked a variety of legal confidentiality protections including state secrets privilege and attorney-client privilege, among others. Attorney General Pam Bondi earlier this month told Fox News that Abrego Garcia \"is not coming back to our country.\" Court documents show that Abrego Garcia entered the U.S. illegally but was granted protection by an immigration judge in 2019 that should have prevented his deportation. He had been living quietly in Maryland with his wife and three children and working in construction until Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers arrested and deported him last month. Lawyers for Abrego Garcia complained Tuesday that despite the court-ordered discovery process, the government had produced \"nothing of substance\" and repeatedly refused to answer questions based on what the administration called the \"false premise\" that the administration must facilitate his release. In fact, that isexactly what the Supreme Courtordered. Judge Xinis dismissed the government's state secrets argument, writing that the administration has been hiding behind \"vague\" and \"unsubstantiated\" claims of privilege to evade her orders. Multiple federal courts have already weighed in on this case. Ina remarkable opinion, appeals court Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson said the government's argument \"should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.\" \"The government asserts that Abrego Garcia is a terrorist and a member of MS-13. Perhaps, but perhaps not,\" wrote Wilkinson, a conservative judge who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan. \"Regardless, he is still entitled to due process.\" The case parallels another ongoing legal battle involving more than 100 Venezuelan migrants deported to El Salvador under the wartime Alien Enemies Act without opportunities to contest allegations they were gang members. In that case, federal judge James Boasberg has already threatened criminal contempt proceedings against administration officials. Legal experts watching both cases suggest the judiciary and executive branch are headed toward a constitutional showdown, with judges' patience wearing thin as the administration appears to be moving closer to open defiance of the court's orders.

    "title": "Funding cut for landmark study of women's health",
    "article_text": "Rob Stein Federal funding to support collection of new research data for the Women's Health Initiative will end in September 2025.Stefania Pelfini/Getty Images/Moment RFhide caption The Trump administration is shutting down most of a landmark federal project studying women's health, stunning researchers around the country. \"It's a huge loss. I can't put into words what a huge loss it is,\" saysMarian Neuhouser, who chairs the steering committee for the federally fundedWomen's Health Initiative. The study, begun in the 1990s, has produced a series of groundbreaking results and was continuing to gather valuable data about women's health. The Department of Health and Human Services is terminating contracts with all four regional centers that have been following tens of thousands of women who have been participating in the project for decades,according to the project's coordinating center. Neither the National Institutes of Health, which funds the study, nor HHS, which oversees the NIH, responded to NPR's questions about the matter. But Neuhouser says HHS notified the project's four regional centers in California, New York, Ohio and North Carolina that their contracts for collecting data will be terminated in September. The decision comes as the Trump administration has been demanding all federal health agencies cut what they spend on contracts by at least 35%, in addition to massive layoffs, grant terminations and other cuts. \"We're all shocked. It feels like being punched in the gut,\" says Dr.Marcia Stefanick, who leads the coordinating center at Stanford University. \"It's just outrageous. It's such an important study. It's devastating. It just feels terrible.\" Others said the decision is ironic given that the new administration has made fighting chronic diseases a top priority. The initiative is uniquely positioned to produce important new insights into many chronic diseases, including Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia, Stefanick and others say. \"No study is a better example of the enormous scientific impact of research on the prevention of chronic disease in the population, which is one of the stated priorities of the HHS leadership,\" says Dr.JoAnn Mansonof the Harvard Medical School, a long-term principal investigator with the initiative. \"The funding cuts to the Women's Health Initiative will deal a devastating blow to all older adults.\" The NIH launched the initiative in the 1990s because most medical research had been conducted in men. The lack of women in studies raised crucial questions about whether their findings applied to women and it left unanswered health questions unique to women. \"When WHI was formed there was a need to understand women's health because so little had been funded in women's health,\" saysJean Wactawski-Wende, who leads another regional center at the University at Buffalo, whose $1.2 million contract is being terminated. Scientists at more than 40 research centers around the country started collecting detailed information about more than 160,000 women, including data about their diets, exercise, medications and illnesses. And over the years, the project produced a series of landmark discoveries. Probably the most well known was the recognition that taking hormones starting in menopause does not protect a woman's heart, which had been the medical dogma for years. Later findings supported the use of hormones to ease symptoms of menopause. The initiative also produced important findings about whether taking vitamins like vitamin D and calcium can decrease the risk for osteoporosis and cancer. The study found no benefit. \"It's a huge blow,\" says Wactawski-Wade. \"It's been one of the most productive studies in history. And to really understand older women's health — dementia, heart failure, frailty — we are the study to do that. And it's been eviscerated right now because of these budget cuts.\" Wactawski-Wade and the other coordinating centers will cease collecting any new data from more than 40,000 women who are still in the study. The researchers are starting to notify the now older women in the study that their participation will be ending. The fate of the study's coordinating center at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center is unknown. The project says HHS has informed it that the coordinating center's funding will continue through January, but what happens after that remains \"unclear.\" One big question is what will happen to the huge repository of data, including blood and urine samples and genetic material, which represents a treasure trove that could be mined to make yet more important discoveries. \"We are really the guardians of the database – the biorepository,\" says Neuhouser. \"There's a glimmer of hope that we might be able to continue, but we don't know.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "After Kashmir attack, India downgrades ties with Pakistan and suspends water treaty",
    "article_text": "By Omkar Khandekar Security personnel patrol a street the morning after militants indiscriminately opened fire on tourists near Pahalgam in Indian-controlled Kashmir, April 23.Dar Yasin/APhide caption MUMBAI, India — The day after a deadly attack on touristskilled 26 peoplein the mountain town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, India announced it was closing a border with Pakistan, downgrading its diplomatic ties and suspending a crucial water treaty. The Indus Waters Treatylays out how India and Pakistan use water from six rivers that flow through both countries. It was negotiated by the World Bank in 1960 andaffectshundreds of millions of people on either side of the border. India's foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, told reporters on Tuesday night that the treaty will remain suspended until Pakistan \"credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism.\" He added that no Pakistani national will be allowed into India anymore under aspecial visa programand asked such visa holders in India to leave the country within 48 hours. Pakistan's military advisers serving in the country's high commission in New Delhi have a week to leave India. Misri said India will be withdrawing its counterparts from Islamabad too. These decisions, hesaid, were made in a meeting chaired by India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who cut short a visit to Saudi Arabia to return to India following news of Tuesday's attack. Misri's announcement came hours after Pakistan's Defense Minister Khawaja AsifdeniedPakistani involvement in Tuesday's attack. \"This is the result of a Hindutva [Hindu nationalist] government exploiting and killing religious minorities, including Christians and Buddhists,\" Asif told a Pakistani news channel. The attackers, he said, were India's \"homegrown rebels.\" Pakistan's Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif has called for a National Security Council meeting to address the situation Thursday morning. India has long accused its western neighbor of stoking and sponsoring armed militancy in India-administered Kashmir, accusations that Pakistan denies. The Muslim-majority Kashmir region has been disputed between India and Pakistan since they became independent nations in 1947. Each country claims Kashmir in its entirety. They have fought three wars over it. Pakistan controls a smaller portion of the region, known as Azad Kashmir. Tuesday's attack on Indian civilians is being referred to as the worst since gunmen stormed the streets of Mumbai in 2008 andkilledmore than 160 people. Indian investigations later alleged the attackers were trained in Pakistan. Indian media nowallegePakistani origins of the Pahalgam attackers, andanalystspointed toa speechPakistan's army chief Gen. Asim Munir made last week, reiterating support for Kashmiris' struggle against what he called \"Indian occupation.\" Analysts say thousands of civilians and Indian military personnel have been killed in Kashmir since armed militancy took root in the early 1990s. In 2019, the Indian Parliament passed a law that revoked the region's administrative autonomy, which many in the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party had blamed for the violence that has rocked the Himalayan valley. For months after, mobile and internet communications were blocked, movement of Kashmiris was restricted and local politicians were detained in jails or their own residences. The years since the clampdown saw a dramatic fall in the number of violent attacks. But in recent years, attacks haveincreased, often targeting Indian migrant workers from outside Kashmir. As in the Pahalgam attack, most of the victims have been Hindus. In Tuesday's attack, a little-known militant group called Kashmir Resistance claimed responsibility. In a post on Telegram, it said the attack was in retaliation for the \"demographic changes\" seen in the valley since 2019. In the wake of the attack, leaders including President Trump expressed support for India, with the U.S. president postingon Truth Socialthat India had his \"full support.\" On India's right-wing news channels, there are calls for retaliatory attacks against Pakistan. Sushant Singh, alecturer in South Asian studies at Yale Universityand a former Indian military officer, said that the jingoism surrounding the attacks eclipses the security and political failures. \"The fact that Kashmir is a disputed territory between India and Pakistan is well known. Pakistan has provided a lot of support, including training to armed militants who operate inside Kashmir. But the focus on Pakistan cannot obscure the questions of accountability from the Indian establishment, including India's political leadership, that they have failed to keep a large number of Indian people safe in Kashmir,\" he says. Singh says that the Kashmir policy of India's Hindu nationalist government has alienated residents of Kashmir, and cost the Indian army its vital network of local informers. \"It's essentially more like domination and oppression than engagement and support. So, with this kind of politics, which is of exclusion and oppression and targeting, the emotional distance between Kashmir and Delhi has increased even further than what it has historically been,\" he says.

    "title": "Tapeworm in fox poop that will slowly destroy your organs is on the rise",
    "article_text": "The worm indefinitely proliferates into cystic masses in organs, mimicking cancer. No matter how bad things might seem, at least you haven't accidentally eaten fox poop and developed an insidious tapeworm infection that masquerades as a cancerous liver tumor while it slowly destroys your organs and eventually kills you—or, youprobablyhaven't done that. What's more, according toa newly published study in Emerging Infectious Diseases, even if you have somehow feasted on fox feces and acquired this nightmare parasite, it's looking less likely that doctors will need to hack out chunks of your organs to try to stop it. That's the good news from the new study. The bad news is that, while this infection is fairly rare, it appears to be increasing. And, if you do get it, you might have a shorter lifespan than the uninfected and may be sicker in general. The new study is a retrospective one, in which a group of doctors in Switzerland examined medical records of 334 patients who developed the disease alveolar echinococcosis (AE) over a 50-year span (1973–2022). AE is an understudied, life-threatening infection caused by the fox tapeworm,Echinococcus multilocularis. The parasite is not common, but can be found throughout the Northern Hemisphere, particularly regions of China and Russia, and countries in continental Europe and North America. In the parasite's intended lifecycle, adult intestinal worms release eggs into the feces of their primary host—foxes, or sometimes coyotes, dogs, or other canids. The eggs then get ingested by an intermediate host, such as voles. There, eggs develop into a spherical embryo with six hooks that pierce through the intestinal wall to migrate to the animal's organs, primarily the liver. Once nestled into an organ, the parasites develop into multi-chambered, thin-walled cysts—a proliferative life stage that lasts indefinitely. As more cysts develop, the masslooks and acts like cancer, forming necrotic cavities and sometimes metastasizing to other organs, such as the lungs and brain. The parasite remains in these cancerous-like masses, waiting for a fox to eat the cyst-riddled organs of its host. Back in a fox, the worms attach to the intestines and grow into adults. Humans crash this vile cycle by accidentally eating the eggs excreted by infected foxes or other primary hosts. This generally happens by a delightful \"hand-to-mouth\" transfer or contamination of food. In humans, the parasites invade organs much like they do in voles, forming cancer-like masses in organs. In the liver, the infection closely resembles liver cancer and cirrhosis. The tumor-like parasites can also spread to the lungs, brain, heart, bone, and other organs. In humans, the infection is insidious, with anasymptomatic incubation periodof between 5 and 15 years. Once the disease develops, about 90 percent of people will die within 10 years if they are not treated. The most common treatment in the past has been surgically removing sections of organs where the cysts are endlessly proliferating, which doesn't always catch all the parasites. However, modern treatment has turned more toward using benzimidazole drugs that fight parasitic worms, namely albendazole or mebendazole. Of the 334 patients with AE in the Swiss study—who were all treated at the University Hospital of Zurich between 1973 and 2022—the median age at diagnosis was 57.5 years. Of the 334 patients, 151 had some type of surgery to remove the parasites, and 315 received benzimidazole drug therapy. Over the 50-year study period, 90 patients died, but most of the deaths were from causes other than the parasitic infection. Only 13 deaths were caused by AE. Survival analyses showed that those with AE had lower survival rates compared with the general population five years after diagnosis, especially those who were diagnosed with AE later in life. But, AE did not appear to be the main driver of their shortened life expectancy. The reasons for this aren't entirely clear, but the authors speculate that \"the gradual decline of relative survival 5 years after diagnosis could reflect a generally sicker population.\" Further, those who had curative surgery did not have a statistically significant boost in survival compared with infected patients who didn't have curative surgery. The authors attributed this finding to the \"excellent disease control with benzimidazole drug therapy.\" They recommend that clinicians rethink the optimal treatment for AE. \"Today, treatment decisions should be made on the basis of the patient’s expected remaining years with the disease and the potential complications and cost-effectiveness of either a surgical or conservative approach,\" they write. \"Although younger patients will most likely benefit from radical resection, older patients may not.\" Like other previous studies, the Swiss analysis found a jump in infections starting around 2000. It's unclear what's causing this, but researchers have speculated that habitat expansion of primary host populations, an increased use of imaging in health care, and a more susceptible population may be possible explanations. In the current study, the increase in the number of cases was linked to a \"substantial\" increase in incidental findings of AE—that is, asymptomatic parasitic cysts were detected inadvertently during medical care. That points to increased imaging. But, in 2021,researchers in Canadareported AE as an emerging disease in Alberta, which they partly attributed to the growing urbanization of coyotes.

    "article_text": "Live-action film is directed by Dan Trachtenberg ofPreyfame. It's not every day you get a trailer for a new, live-action Predator movie, but today is one of those days. 20th Century Studios just released the first teaser forPredator: Badlands, a feature film that unconventionally makes the classic movie monster a protagonist. The film follows Dek (Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi), a young member of the predator species and society who has been banished. He'll work closely with a Weyland-Yutani Android named Thia (Elle Fanning) to take down \"the ultimate adversary,\" which the trailer dubs a creature that \"can't be killed.\" The adversary looks like a very large monster we haven't seen before, judging from a few shots in the trailer. Some or all of the film is rumored to take place on the Predator home world, and the movie intends to greatly expand on the mythology around the Predators' culture, language, and customs. It's intended as a standalone movie in the Predator/Alien universe. The trailer depicts sequences involving multiple predators fighting or threatening one another, Elle Fanning looking very strange and cool as an android, and glimpses of new monsters and the alien world the movie focuses on. Predator: Badlands' director and co-writer is Dan Trachtenberg, who directed another recent, highly acclaimed, standalone Predator movie:Prey. That film put a predator in the usual antagonist role, and had a historical setting, following a young Native American woman who went up against it. Trachtenberg has also recently been working on an animated anthology series calledPredator: Killer of Killers, which is due to premiere on Hulu (which also carriedPrey) on June 6. Predator: Badlandswill debut in theaters on November 7. This is just the first teaser trailer, so we'll learn more in subsequent trailers—though we know quite a bit already, it seems.

    "title": "Can the legal system catch up with climate science?",
    "article_text": "New estimate: Fossil fuel companies have caused trillions of dollars in damages. A few decades ago, it wasn't realistic to attribute individual events—even heat waves—to the general warming trend driven by human-caused climate change. Now, there are peer-reviewed methods ofrapidly detecting humanity's fingerprintsin the wake of weather disasterslike hurricanesorclimate-driven wildfires. In today's issue of Nature, Dartmouth's Christopher Callahan and Justin Mankin argue that we've reached a similar level of sophistication regarding another key question: What are the economic damages caused by individual climate events? They argue that we can now assign monetary values to the damage caused by emissions that can be traced back to individual companies. They found that \"The global economy would be $28 trillion richer ... were it not for the extreme heat caused by the emissions from the 111 carbon majors.\" They argue that this method might provide legal ammunition for those interested in seeking climate damages in court: \"By revealing the human fingerprint on events previously thought to be ‘acts of God,’ attribution science has helped make climate change legally legible.\" The method used by Callahan and Mankin is a variant on standard climate attribution studies. In the standard studies, climate models are run with and without the carbon dioxide that humanity has pumped into the atmosphere through fossil fuels and land use changes. You can then compare the frequency of specific weather events, like the intensity of rainfall from a hurricane or the peak temperatures of a heatwave, both with and without the added CO2. The difference in frequency is an indication of the impact of climate change. But it's possible to repeat the analysis with arbitrary amounts of carbon dioxide. So, the researchers could calculate the estimated emissions from different companies and compare the probabilities of events with and without those emissions. So, for example, Callahan and Mankin calculate the individual contributions of the companies responsible for the most carbon emissions (the \"carbon majors\" mentioned earlier), such as Chevron or Saudi Aramco. These include both the direct emissions during fossil fuel production, as well as the emissions that result when the products are burned. Similarly, it's possible to calculate the impact of emissions within a limited number of years. For example, Callahan and Mankin note that internal oil company research suggested that climate change would be a problem back around 1980, and calculated the impact of emissions that occurred after people knew they were an issue. So, the approach is extremely flexible. From there, the researchers could use empirical information that links elevated temperatures to economic damage. \"Recent peer-reviewed work has used econometrics to infer causal relationships between climate hazards and outcomes such as income loss, reduced agricultural yields, increased human mortality, and depressed economic growth,\" Callahan and Mankin write. These metrics can be used to estimate the cost of things like flooding, crop losses, and other economic damages. Alternately, the researchers could analyze the impact on individual climate events where the financial costs have been calculated separately. To implement their method, the researchers perform lots of individual models, collectively providing the most probable costs and the likely range around them. First, they translate each company's emissions into the impact on the global mean surface temperature. That gets translated to an impact on extreme temperatures, producing an estimate of what the days with the five most extreme temperatures would look like. That, in turn, is translated to economic damages associated with extreme heat. Callahan and Mankin use Chevron as an example. By 2020, Chevron's emissions were responsible for 0.025° C of the warming that year. If you perform a similar analysis for the ears between 1991 and 2020, the researchers come up with a range of damages that runs from a low of about $800 billion all the way up to $3.6 trillion. Most of the damage affected nations in the tropics. Carrying on through the five companies that have led to the most carbon emissions, they calculate that Saudi Aramco, Gazprom, Chevron, and Exxon Mobile have all produced damages of about $2 trillion. BP brings up the rear, with \"just\" $1.45 trillion in damage. For the full list of 111 carbon majors, Callahan and Mankin place the total damages at roughly $28 trillion. To look at the differences between separate periods, the researchers analyze the impacts in terms of an entity that's responsible for 5 percent of the total carbon emissions—that's roughly a quarter of the US's contributions, or a bit more than the entire contribution of Brazil. For the full period with global temperature records starting in 1850, the damages would be $4.2 trillion. If you start when Exxon's internal research work first highlighted the risk of climate change in 1977, the damage would be $3.3 trillion. If you wait until a clear scientific consensus that it was happening emerged (1990), then the damages would still be $2.5 trillion. (Note that this analysis does not attempt to quantify the benefits of burning fossil fuels during this period. And it also leaves out various non-climate costs, such as the impact of pollution on health.) The analysis of individual events produces smaller, but still striking numbers. For a2012 heat wave in North America, the researchers place Chevron's share of the damages at just shy of $30 billion. Smaller losses ($28.8 and $3 billion) were associated with heat waves that struck Russia in 2010 and France in 2003. Callahan and Mankin directly relate this to potential legal liability, arguing that science has progressed to the point where it has something to say about potential liabilities. \"To sue over an injury, a litigant typically must demonstrate a causal connection between the action of the defendant and the plaintiff’s injury, sometimes through meeting a ‘but for’ standard: 'but for the actions of the defendant, the plaintiff would not have been injured.'” As they note, this matches up very well with the structure of their analysis, which compares the present climate to one that includes all the emissions \"but for\" the ones associated with specific companies. But they also note that we're still figuring out what legal standards should be applied, and who should be held liable. For example, asuit in Montanatargeted the state for failing to provide its residents with a healthful environment. Other suits have targeted emissions as creating a public nuisance, or companies for misleading their investors by failing to account for climate-related risks. The liability that this study speaks to is not the only option for seeking legal redress. Still, with this work as a guideline, it seems inevitable that someone will attempt to use this to hold oil companies to account. Nature, 2025. DOI:10.1038/s41586-025-08751-3(About DOIs).

    "article_text": "Biggest threat to free speech \"is coming from our own government,\" Gomez says. A Democratic member of the Federal Communications Commission plans what she calls a First Amendment tour to fight the Trump administration's \"ongoing campaign of censorship and control.\" \"Since the founding of our country, the First Amendment has protected our fundamental right to speak freely and hold power to account. Today, the greatest threat to that freedom is coming from our own government,\" Commissioner Anna Gomezsaid yesterday. Gomez plans to focus on FCC Chairman Brendan Carr's actions against news broadcasters and tech firms. Under Carr, \"the FCC is being weaponized to attack freedom of speech in the media and telecommunications sector instead of focusing on its core mission—connecting the public, protecting consumers, and supporting competition,\" Gomez's announcement said. Gomez's office said \"she is partnering with consumer and civil society organizations across the ideological spectrum to participate in speaking engagements and listening sessions focused on protecting the rights and freedoms enshrined in the First Amendment.\" The first event isscheduled for Thursdayand will be hosted by the Center for Democracy and Technology. The events will be open to the public and livestreamed when possible, and feature various speakers on free speech, media, and telecommunications issues. With Democrat Geoffrey Starksplanning to leavethe commission soon, Republicans will gain a 2–1 majority, and Gomez is set to be the only Democrat on the FCC for at least a while. Carr is meanwhile pursuingnews distortion investigationsinto CBS and ABC, and he hasthreatened Comcastwith a similar probe into its subsidiary NBC. Gomez's press release criticized Carr for these and other actions. \"From investigating broadcasters for editorial decisions in their newsrooms, to harassing private companies for their fair hiring practices, to threatening tech companies that respond to consumer demand for fact-checking tools, the FCC's actions have focused on weaponizing the agency's authority to silence critics,\" Gomez's office said. Gomez previously criticized Carr forreviving news distortion complaintsthat were dismissed shortly before Trump's inauguration. \"We cannot allow our licensing authority to be weaponized to curtail freedom of the press,\" she said at the time.

    "article_text": "The modding community is already hard at work despite lack of \"official\" support. Bethesdaisn't officially supporting modsforthe newly releasedElder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered. But that hasn't stopped some players from discovering that many mods created for the 2006 original seem to work just fine in the new game with a bare minimum of installation headaches. Asnoted on Redditandthe Bethesda Game Studios Discord, some .esp mod files designed years ago for the originalOblivionhave the same effect when plugged into the newRemasteredgame. Ars confirmed this during some quick testing, usinga mod uploaded in 2008to easily add high-end weapons and armor to the opening jail cell scene in theRemasteredversion. While players of the original game could usethe Oblivion Mod Managerto easily install these mods, doing so in theRemasteredversion requires a bit more manual work. First, users have to download the applicable .esp mod files and put them in the \"Content/Dev/ObvData/Data\" folder (the same one that already houses DLC data files like \"DLCHorseArmor.esp\"). Then it's just a matter of opening \"Plugins.txt\" in the same folder and adding that full .esp file name to the plaintext list. Early testersreportthat some more complex mods designed for the originalOblivionwill lead to crashes or mixed results when loaded in theRemasteredgame. Otherstheorizethat \"the game seems to read OGOblivionas its base, so manually adding a mod that doesn’t have new assets ... would work.\" As the community continues to analyze this modding backward compatibility, other modders have already rushed torelease dozens of new modsdesigned specifically for theRemasteredversion, even without official support from Bethesda. At this point, most of these seem focused onsome basic UI tweaksorquality-of-lifehacksto make the game more enjoyable (we're particularly fond ofthis one that makes slow-walking NPCs a bit faster). More complex mods may requirediving into the Unreal Engine's pak file formatto replace in-game assets with new, modded versions.

    "title": "AI secretly helped write California bar exam, sparking uproar",
    "article_text": "A contractor used AI to create 23 out of the 171 scored multiple-choice questions. On Monday, the State Bar of Californiarevealedthat it used AI to develop a portion of multiple-choice questions on its February 2025 bar exam, causing outrage among law school faculty and test takers. The admission comes after weeks of complaints about technical problems and irregularities during the exam administration,reportsthe Los Angeles Times. The State Bar disclosed that its psychometrician (a person or organization skilled in administrating psychological tests),ACS Ventures, created 23 of the 171 scored multiple-choice questions with AI assistance. Another 48 questions came from a first-year law student exam, while Kaplan Exam Services developed the remaining 100 questions. The State Bar defended its practices, telling the LA Times that all questions underwent review by content validation panels and subject matter experts before the exam. \"The ACS questions were developed with the assistance of AI and subsequently reviewed by content validation panels and a subject matter expert in advance of the exam,\" wrote State Bar Executive Director Leah Wilson in a press release. According to the LA Times, the revelation has drawn strong criticism from several legal education experts. \"The debacle that was the February 2025 bar exam is worse than we imagined,\" saidMary Basick, assistant dean of academic skills at the University of California, Irvine School of Law. \"I'm almost speechless. Having the questions drafted by non-lawyers using artificial intelligence is just unbelievable.\" Katie Moran, an associate professor at the University of San Francisco School of Law who specializes in bar exam preparation, called it \"a staggering admission.\" She pointed out that the same company that drafted AI-generated questions also evaluated and approved them for use on the exam. Alex Chan, chair of the State Bar's Committee of Bar Examiners, noted that the California Supreme Court had urged the State Bar to explore \"new technologies, such as artificial intelligence\" to improve testing reliability and cost-effectiveness. However, the California Supreme Court told the LA Times that it \"was unaware that AI had been used to draft any of the multiple-choice questions\" until the State Bar's Monday press release. The AI disclosure follows other problems with the February exam. Test takers reported being kicked off online testing platforms, experiencing screen lag and error messages, and encountering typos and confusing questions. These issues prompted a federal lawsuit againstMeazure Learning, the exam administrator, and calls for an audit of the State Bar. The State Bar of California switched from the National Conference of Bar Examiners' Multistate Bar Examination to its own hybrid in-person and remote testing model last year while facing a $22 million deficit. It contracted with Kaplan Exam Services for $8.25 million to create test questions. According to the LA Times, law professors Basick and Moran had previously raised concerns about the quality of the February exam questions, noting that the 50 practice questions released before the exam \"still contain numerous errors\" even after editing. Basick expressed additional concerns about the use of first-year law exam questions, arguing that an exam determining minimal competence to practice law requires a different standard than one assessing first-year law school learning. The State Bar plans to ask the California Supreme Court to adjust test scores for February exam takers but has resisted returning to the National Conference of Bar Examiners exams for July, citing test security concerns with remote testing options. The Committee of Bar Examiners will meet on May 5 to discuss remedies, but Chan said the State Bar is unlikely to release all 200 exam questions or return to National Conference of Bar Examiners tests soon, as nearly half of California bar applicants want to keep the remote testing option.

    "title": "Trump is “desperate” to make a deal—China isn’t, analysts say",
    "article_text": "China apparently gains upper hand, while TikTok's fate hangs in the balance. Donald Trump has started signaling that he's ready to slash tariffs on Chinese imports, but economists have warned that the US softening its stance now likely cedes power to China, which perhaps benefits from dragging out trade talks. On Tuesday, Trump confirmed that he is willing to reduce 145 percent tariffs on all Chinese imports. A senior White House officialtold The Wall Street Journalthat the tariffs may come \"down to between roughly 50 percent and 65 percent.\" Or perhaps the US may use a tiered approach, charging a 35 percent tax on goods that don't threaten national security, while requiring 100 percent tariffs on imports \"deemed as strategic to America’s interest,\" other insiders told the WSJ. For now, Trump is being vague, only confirming that tariffs \"won't be that high\" or \"anywhere near\" 145 percent. Attempting to maintain a tough veneer, Trump warned that China must act quickly to make a deal to end the trade war or else risk making concessions that China may not consider ideal. \"If they don't make a deal, we'll set the deal,\" he said. But analyststold the South China Morning Postthat Trump appears \"anxious\" and \"panicked,\" rushing to make a deal that China can afford to delay until more favorable terms are offered. So far, Trump has not met with China's president Xi Jinping, the WSJ reported, which will be essential to inking a deal. Instead, US officials have been in contact with underlings who have not helped advance the deal. Last week, Trump confirmed the deal was not \"imminent,\" the South China Morning Post reported, despite meeting a \"number of times\" to discuss opening up negotiations. On Wednesday, while analysts suggested that Trump appeared \"desperate\" for a \"quick deal,\" China’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Guo Jiakun, warned that the only path to a deal required the US to \"stop making threats and resorting to coercion.\" According to Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis, China is well-positioned to get a better deal. \"[Trump] needs a quick deal,\" Garcia-Herrero told the South China Morning Post. \"China does not need to offer anything big in such circumstances, because the US is so desperate for a deal. With a few billion in imports from the US, China might manage to lower the tariffs. The deal might be sweeter for China than in 2019.\" One source familiar with the Trump administration's thinking at this stage of negotiationstold Reutersthat Trump is even willing to stop acting unilaterally to get China to come to the table, likely offering that any future trade action \"would be in conjunction with negotiations.\" Another potential concession could find Trump phasing in tariffs over a five-year period, which could offer China a desirable cushion compared to some of the arbitrary tariffs that Trump announced on social media with enforcement deadlines within days. Trump isn't so desperate that he's ready to remove all tariffs, though. On Tuesday, he confirmed that seemingly no matter how good negotiations go, \"it won’t be zero.\" According to the WSJ, although China retaliated with increased tariffs on US imports to 125 percent and seemingly has not seriously engaged Trump, China remains \"open to trade talks\" so long as Trump keeps things civil. Their ongoing demands that Trump drop the tough guy act continue, even as people who consult with Chinese officials told the WSJ that Chinese policymaking circles see Trump's latest moves \"as a sign of him folding.\" Chen Zhiwu, a chair professor of finance at the University of Hong Kong, told the South China Morning Post that \"the more he talks like this, the more it shows how anxious the US side is.\" \"Trump and his team are under pressure, but China isn’t showing any signs of impatience,\" Chen said. It's Trump facing all the pressure to end the trade war, Chen suggested. Trump risks his approval rating falling the longer markets appear destabilized, US economic growth forecasts appear threatened, and theUS dollar's dominance in global trade risks disruption. Among those hardest hit arethe tech industryandonline retailers. China has little reason to rush to make a deal that ends all that, if more power can be derived from waiting it out, Chen suggested, especially since theChinese yuan's popularity is risingamidst the US trade chaos. Instead of rushing to meet with Trump, China is apparently wooing key US ally Japan to team up to oppose Trump's tariffs, NewsweekreportedWednesday. On Tuesday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed that negotiations with China had not yet started, but \"no one thinks the current status quo is sustainable, at 145 and 125 [percent], so I would posit that over the very near future, there will be a de-escalation.\" But Xu Tianchen, a senior China economist, told the South China Morning Post that China may decide to wait and force Trump to make maximum concessions under potentially more intense pressure. \"Rising living costs, economic disarray, and popular discontent will eventually force a definite pivot of Trump’s approach,\" Xu said. Potentially adding to the pressure are questions about TikTok. Trump's initial wave of tariff announcements in early April apparently shut down the TikTok deal that would allow the popular social media app—which last yearreportedhelping contribute $24 billion to the US economy in 2023—to continue operating in the US. A person familiar with the dealtold AP Newsthat the US was very close to finalizing an agreement to spin off TikTok into a US-owned company in which current owner ByteDance would maintain a minority stake. But ByteDance was forced to shut down the deal after Trump rolled out tariffs because \"China would no longer approve the deal\" until the trade negotiations were resolved, the source told AP News. At that time, a ByteDance spokesperson told AP News that there were still \"key matters to be resolved\" before reaching a TikTok deal. The longer Trump pushes back the TikTok deal deadline, the less urgent the supposed national security threat that TikTok poses feels to Americans who have continued using the app without any changes ever since Trump paused enforcement of the TikTok ban law. While analysts claim that Trump looks soft to China, at least one TikTok user, Terrell Wade—who is known to his 1.5 million followers as @TheWadeEmpire—told AP News that Trump's tough stance on TikTok looks less serious, too. \"Every time a new deadline pops up, it starts to feel less like a real threat and more like background noise,\" Wade said. \"That doesn’t mean I’m ignoring it, but it’s hard to keep reacting with the same urgency each time.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "article_text": "\"Wherever there's murder and mayhem, you will always find an Addams.\" It's been a long, long wait, but we're finally getting a second season of the Netflix supernatural horror comedy,Wednesday. The streaming giant dropped the first teaser and several first-look images to whet our appetites for what promises to be an excellent follow-up to the delightful first season. (Spoilers for S1 below.) Aspreviously reported, director Tim Burton famously turned down the opportunity to direct the 1991 feature filmThe Addams Family, inspired bycharacters createdby American cartoonist Charles Addams for The New Yorker in 1938.Wednesdayshowrunners Alfred Gough and Miles Millar—best known forSmallville—expected Burton to turn them down as well when they made their pitch. He signed up for the project instead. This was an older, edgier, and even darker Wednesday (Jenna Ortega) than the dour young girl Christina Ricci made famous in the 1990s. Aloof, sardonic, and resolutely independent, she was very much the problem child, even by Addams standards, having been expelled from eight schools in five years. Hence her enrollment at Nevermore Academy, a haven for so-called \"outcasts\" and the alma mater of her parents. Wednesday struggled to fit in at first, clashing with her cheery werewolf roommate Enid (Emma Myers) and the school queen bee, a siren named Bianca (Joy Sunday). Then she began investigating a string of brutal murders, leading her to resolve some long-standing family issues and delve into the school's dark history. It all added up to a winning formula—basically a very good eight-hour Burton movie with a spooky murder mystery at its core. Most of the main cast returns for S2, including Ortega, Myers, and Sunday. Reprising their roles: Luis Guzman and Catherine Zeta-Jones as Gomez and Morticia Addams; Isaac Ordonez as Pugsley Addams; Victor Dorobantu as Thing; Fred Armisen as Uncle Fester; Luyanda Unati Lewis-Nyawo as Deputy Ritchie Santiago; Hunter Doohan as Tyler Galpin, revealed as a murderous Hyde in the S1 finale; and Jamie McShane as Donovan Galpin, the Jericho sheriff and Tyler's father (McShane is a guest this season). We'll miss Gwendoline Christie's Principal Larissa Weems and Christina Ricci's diabolical botany teacher, Marilyn Thornhill (RIP to both), but at least we're getting the fabulous Joanna Lumley as Hester Frump, Morticia's mother. Other new cast members include Billie Piper, Steve Buscemi, Evie Templeton, Owen Painter, and Noah Tyler. And apparently Lady Gaga will make a guest appearance. It looks like Wednesday's S1 love interest, Xavier (Percy Hynes White), will not be back for S2. Here's hoping we'll at least be seeing more of nerdy bee enthusiast Eugene (Moosa Mostafa). The second season ofWednesday will drop on Netflix in two parts. Part 1 premieres on August 6, 2025, while Part 2 will follow on September 3, 2025.

    "article_text": "Google revealed in court that Gemini now sees 350 million monthly users. You may not use Gemini or other AI products, but many people do, and their ranks are growing. During day three of Google'santitrust remedies trial, the company presented a slide showing that Gemini reached 350 million monthly active users as of March 2025. That's a massive increase from last year, showing that Google is beginning to gain traction among competing chatbots, but Google's estimation of ChatGPT's traffic shows it still has a long climb ahead of it. The slide was presentedduring the testimony of Sissie Hsiao, who until recently was leading Google's Gemini efforts. She wasreplaced earlier this monthby Josh Woodward, who also runs Google Labs. The slide listed Gemini's 350 million monthly users, along with daily traffic of 35 million users. These numbers represent a huge increase for Gemini, which languished in the tens of millions of monthly users late last year. Gemini's daily user count at the time was a mere 9 million, according to Google. Since then, Google has released its Gemini 2.0 and2.5 models, both of which have shown demonstrable improvements over the previous iterations. It has also begun adding Gemini features to more parts of the Google ecosystem, even though some of those integrations can be more frustrating than useful. Despite the uptick in Gemini usage, Google is still far from catching OpenAI. Naturally, Google has been keeping a close eye on ChatGPT traffic. OpenAI has also seen traffic increase, putting ChatGPT around 600 million monthly active users, according to Google's analysis. Early this year, reports pegged ChatGPT usage at around 400 million users per month. There are many ways to measure web traffic, and not all of them tell you what you might think. For example, OpenAI has recently claimed weekly traffic as high as 400 million, but companies can choose the seven-day period in a given month they report as weekly active users. A monthly metric is more straightforward, and we have some degree of trust that Google isn't using fake or unreliable numbers in a case where the company's past conduct has already harmed its legal position. While all AI firms strive to lock in as many users as possible, this is not the total win it would be for a retail site or social media platform—each person using Gemini or ChatGPT costs the company money because generative AI is so computationally expensive. Google doesn't talk about how much it earns (more likely loses) from Gemini subscriptions, but OpenAI has noted that it loses money even on its$200 monthly plan. So while having a broad user base is essential to make these products viable in the long term, it just means higher costs unless the cost of running massive AI models comes down.

    "article_text": "Campaigns and spinoffs, even commercial, can use basic pieces for free. Wizards of the Coast has released theSystem Reference Document, the heart of the three core rule books that constituteDungeons & Dragons' 2024 gameplay, under a Creative Commons license. This means the company cannot alter the deal further, like italmost did in early 2023, leading toconsiderable pushbackand, eventually, aretreat. It was a long quest, but the lawful good party has earned some long-term rewards, including a new, similarly licensed reference book. Dungeons & Dragonsowner Wizards of the Coast (WotC) put the coreD&Drules into anOpen Gaming Licensein the early 2000s, inspired by Richard Stallman'sGNU General Public License. The idea was that by making the core mechanics, classes, spells, races, and monsters available for anyone to build on, royalty-free, more versions of games would draw more people into the tabletop roleplaying sphere, and perhaps back to the coreD&Dgames and rule books. It also likely didn't do much harm to WotC's properties, as these basic aspects of the game, and bits taken from existing fantasy works, were going to be difficult to copyright. WotC considered that the Open Gaming License (OGL) was open to revisions, however, and the companyproposedchanges to the OGL that would require that anyone making certain amounts of money had to report it (over $50,000 per year) or start paying royalties (over $750,000). Aleaked version of that licenseput the higher-level royalties at 25 percent, and only covered printed materials and static PDFs, leaving virtual tabletop and software makers questioning where they might fit in. Because the OGL was \"perpetual,\" but not \"irrevocable,\" there wasdebate on the legality of WotC's proposed changesand revocation of the 1.0 version of the OGL. After receiving survey feedback thatWotC characterizedas \"in such high volume,\" with \"direction [so] plain,\" it released itsD&DOneSystem Reference Documentunder aCreative Commons 4.0 Attribution 4.0 International License. That meant that not only wereD&D's core mechanics free to use and reference, so long as proper credit was given, but that the license could not be changed at a later date. Version 5.2 of the SRD, all 360-plus pages of it, has now been released under the same Creative Commons license. The major change is that it includes more 2024 5th edition (i.e.,D&DOne) rules and content, while version 5.1 focused on 2014 rules. Legally, you can now design and publish campaigns under the 2024 5th edition rule set. More importantly, more aspects of the newestD&Drule books are available under a free license: There aresome aspects ofD&Dyou still can't really touch without bumping up against copyrights. Certain monsters from the Monster Manual, like the Kraken, are in the public domain, but their specific stats in theD&Drulebook are copyrighted. Iconic creatures and species like the Beholder, Displacer Beast, Illithid, Githyanki, Yuan-Ti, and others remain the property of WotC (and thereby Hasbro).

The companies are required to bring their platforms into compliance within 60 days or face \"periodic penalty payments,\" the EC said. These are the first two non-compliance decisions adopted by the commission under the DMA. The ECsaidit determined that Apple breached its anti-steering obligation and that \"Meta breached the DMA obligation to give consumers the choice of a service that uses less of their personal data.\" \"Apple and Meta have fallen short of compliance with the DMA by implementing measures that reinforce the dependence of business users and consumers on their platforms,\" said European Commissioner for Competition Teresa Ribera. Both companies criticized the fines. Metaallegedthat the EC is \"unfairly restricting personalized advertising\" and that \"forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service.\" \"The European Commission is attempting to handicap successful American businesses while allowing Chinese and European companies to operate under different standards,\" Meta Chief Global Affairs Officer Joel Kaplan said. Apple said in a statement provided to Ars that it \"will appeal and continue engaging with the Commission in service of our European customers.\" \"Today's announcements are yet another example of the European Commission unfairly targeting Apple in a series of decisions that are bad for the privacy and security of our users, bad for products, and force us to give away our technology for free,\" Apple said. \"We have spent hundreds of thousands of engineering hours and made dozens of changes to comply with this law, none of which our users have asked for. Despite countless meetings, the Commission continues to move the goal posts every step of the way.\" The EC can fine companiesup to 10 percentof their global annual turnover, which would amount to many billions for Apple and Meta. Reutersreportedthat the relatively modest fines are \"due to the short period of the breaches, a focus on compliance rather than sanctions, and a desire to avoid possible retaliation from [President Donald] Trump.\" Ribera said the EC took \"firm but balanced enforcement action against both companies, based on clear and predictable rules.\" The EC said Apple is required to let app developers \"inform customers, free of charge, of alternative offers outside the App Store, steer them to those offers and allow them to make purchases.\" But because of \"a number of restrictions imposed by Apple, app developers cannot fully benefit from the advantages of alternative distribution channels outside the App Store,\" the European regulator said. \"Similarly, consumers cannot fully benefit from alternative and cheaper offers as Apple prevents app developers from directly informing consumers of such offers.\" Apple \"failed to demonstrate that these restrictions are objectively necessary and proportionate,\" the EC said. The regulator \"ordered Apple to remove the technical and commercial restrictions on steering and to refrain from perpetuating the non-compliant conduct in the future.\" The DMA requires Meta to \"seek users' consent for combining their personal data between services,\" the EC said. \"Those users who do not consent must have access to a less personalized but equivalent alternative.\" With Meta's \"Consent or Pay\" advertising model introduced in November 2023, \"EU users of Facebook and Instagram had a choice between consenting to personal data combination for personalized advertising or paying a monthly subscription for an ad-free service,\" the EC said. The EC found that this model violated the DMA because it didn't give users \"the required specific choice to opt for a service that uses less of their personal data but is otherwise equivalent to the 'personalized ads' service\" and \"did not allow users to exercise their right to freely consent to the combination of their personal data.\" Meta changed the model in November 2024 after discussions with the commission, the announcement said. \"Meta introduced another version of the free personalized ads model, offering a new option that allegedly uses less personal data to display advertisements,\" the EC said. \"The Commission is currently assessing this new option and continues its dialogue with Meta, requesting the company to provide evidence of the impact that this new ads model has in practice.\" The €200 million fine is only for the period between March 2024, when the DMA obligations took effect, and November 2024. Meta could face another penalty if its new system is also found to be non-compliant. The EC separately gave Meta some good news as it determined that Facebook Marketplace should no longer be designated as a gatekeeper under the DMA because it had fewer than 10,000 business users in 2024. Meta appealed the gatekeeper designation in March 2024. Because of the service's low usage, \"Meta therefore no longer meets the relevant threshold giving rise to a presumption that Marketplace is an important gateway for business users to reach end users,\" the EC said.

    "title": "Zuckerberg stifled Instagram because he loves Facebook, Instagram founder says",
    "article_text": "Before acquiring Instagram, Mark Zuckerberg swore Facebook had “no agenda.” At the Meta monopoly trial, Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom accused Mark Zuckerberg of draining Instagram resources to stifle growth out of sheer jealousy. According to Systrom, Zuckerberg may have been directly involved in yanking resources after integrating Instagram and Facebook because \"as the founder of Facebook, he felt a lot of emotion around which one was better—Instagram or Facebook,\" The Financial Timesreported. In 2025, Instagram is projected toaccount for more than half of Meta's ad revenue, according to eMarketer'sforecast. Since 2019, Instagram has generated more ad revenue per user than Facebook, eMarketer noted, and today makes Meta twice as much per user as the closest rival that Meta claims it fears most, TikTok. Seeming to back up Systrom's claim that Zuckerberg acted irrationally in suppressing Instagram was a 2018 email in which Zuckerberg considered selling off Instagram to \"immediately stop artificially growing Instagram in a way that undermines the Facebook networks.\" That email came right at the moment when Instagram was overtaking Facebook's ad revenue per user, the data suggests, and Systrom testified that he felt Zuckerberg's strategy seemed so fishy that he left the company that year. \"Every company needs to make trade-offs, but... [it] felt like something else was going on,\" Systrom testified. Some of Zuckerberg's interviews from 2012—the year that Facebook bought Instagram—suggest that Systrom may be onto something. In atalkwith Y Combinator's Startup School, Zuckerberg passionately explained that Facebook's services are about \"what makes humans human\" and made a mission of expanding the social capacity of humanity beyond Dunbar's number, which claims that the human brain can only handle maintaining about 150 relationships. At that time, the average Facebook user had about 150 connections, Zuckerberg said, and he fervently wanted the service to essentially train human brains to manage even more social interactions than ever before. \"There had to be a service that gave people the power to share the things they wanted and control it in the way they wanted, and Facebook did that,\" Zuckerberg said. And about his ambition to multiply Dunbar's number, he said, \"it was fundamental for me. I felt this need really acutely; I really wanted this.\" Systrom testified that Zuckerberg favored Facebook so much that he began starving Instagram of resources, including denying any additional staffing to help build out Instagram's video tools in 2017. \"We were given zero of 300 incremental video heads, which is an unacceptable and offensive outcome,\" Systrom testified. Systrom's testimony, the FT reported, \"hit at the heart\" of the Federal Trade Commission's case, as the FTC has alleged that Meta cut off Instagram's growth to avoid Facebook’s \"network collapse.\" Antitrust lawyer, Brendan Benedict, who is monitoring the trial, wroteon Xthat Systrom was \"a really effective witness\" who appeared \"justifiably upset with how Zuckerberg didn't seem to be keeping his end of their bargain.\" By 2018, Systrom testified that Meta viewed Instagram as a \"threat\" to Facebook's growth, The Vergereported. \"If Instagram didn’t grow as quickly, Facebook wouldn’t shrink as quickly or plateau as quickly,\" Systrom testified. \"I don’t think he [Zuckerberg] ever said it out loud that way, but that was the only reason we were having this discussion\" about ending feature integrations between Facebook and Instagram—which was one of the primary ways Meta had fueled Instagram's growth. On Tuesday, Meta issued a statement following Systrom's testimony that maintained Meta's argument that the FTC is rehashing old deals that the agency long ago approved. \"Out-of-context and years-old documents about acquisitions that were reviewed by the FTC more than a decade ago will not obscure the realities of the competition we face or overcome the FTC’s weak case,\" Meta said. Tensions between Zuckerberg and Instagram co-founders Systrom and Mike Krieger started before the acquisition, Zuckerbergtoldattendees at the 2012 TechCrunch Disrupt conference. Explaining that then-Facebook was impressed by Instagram's use of its open graph to make sharing Instagram's appealing photos on Facebook easier, Zuckerberg said that the decision to acquire Instagram came after realizing that Facebook wasn't deriving value from supporting the popular camera app. \"There's this question of, OK, well, we can help them grow,\" Zuckerberg said. \"But without the value occurring to us,\" so I just brought up the idea to Kevin—hey, maybe we should just join and become one company.\" Listening to Zuckerberg at that time, it's easy to see why Systrom so defiantly pushed back on the stand against Meta's claims that its choices were made purely to fuel Instagram's growth. Zuckerberg insisted early on that Instagram wouldn't be forced to integrate with Facebook, which, of course, eventually happened. \"We think Instagram is amazing, and we want to help it grow to hundreds of millions of users,\" Zuckerberg said in 2012. \"We want to help them out with whatever we can, but we have no agenda in terms of making them go into our infrastructure or something. I know a lot of times companies force companies that they're integrating to do stuff like that. I think it's primarily a waste of time.\" Systrom testified that rather than support Instagram, Meta quickly pulled Facebook growth team staff off Instagram, crippling its growth, The Verge reported. Instagram's \"first slowdown that we had was maybe a year into being at Facebook,\" Systrom testified, saying that \"Meta had the 'best' growth team, 'if you could work with them,'\" the FT reported. On X, Benedict reported that Meta's lawyer scored \"some points\" by getting Systrom to admit that Instagram pre-acquisition decided \"not to compete\" with Facebook and had no intentions of ever becoming a social network (seeing itself more as an interests-based app focused on sharing photography). That could undercut the FTC's argument that Facebook shut down a rival's growth. The FTC needs to convince the court that Meta holds a monopoly in a market for personal social networks after foreclosing competition, partly by acquiring Instagram. Meta is hoping to broaden the market definition to pull in other social media rivals, like TikTok, that would significantly reduce Meta's market share below monopoly levels. If the FTC wins, Instagram may be spun off from Meta's \"family of apps,\" which the FTC believes would, for the first time ever, force Meta to face competition as a social media company focused on connecting friends and family. Some critics think that Meta has never really had rivals. Back in 2012, Zuckerberg claimed in his talk with the Startup School that Facebook had no beef with MySpace, for example, which crumpled in the face of Facebook's competition. Instead, he insisted that for Facebook, \"it's not about winning and losing. It's about doing something that's valuable.\" But when Zuckerberg tried to claim that there was \"more than one\" social network in 2012, the Startup School interviewer abruptly interrupted him. \"More than one social network? Not really,\" the interviewer joked, stirring loud laughter from the audience by pointing out the obvious. Rather than point to any Facebook rivals, Zuckerberg dodged by saying that Facebook's integration into a wide range of apps had made nearly everything people did online social. \"My view of the world is almost every product and category is going to get transformed and reimagined to be social,\" Zuckerberg said, almost paving the way for Meta's argument today that it faces vast competition in every direction, including from video apps like YouTube or professional social networks like LinkedIn. Similarly, at the 2012 TechCrunch conference, Zuckerberg explained that Facebook isn't about dominating markets but is instead about fulfilling his vision of expanding the way that humans connect in the world. \"We don't build services to make money,\" Zuckerberg said. \"We make money to build better services.\" And that \"really goes to the heart of the philosophy that we have in running the company,\" he said. \"We exist and we wake up in the morning, and the thing that gets us excited is making a world more open and connected.\" Systrom alleged to the court that, in reality, Zuckerberg ran Facebook based on his personal desire to have his flagship product remain on top. When confronted with an email in which Systrom praised Instagram's seemingly inevitable integration with Facebook for driving growth, Systrom claimed \"he was only emphasizing the benefit to appease Zuckerberg,\" The Verge reported, amid rising tensions between the founders. And when Meta's lawyer asked if that meant he was lying in the email, Systrom appeared to run out of patience for Meta's line of questioning, responding only with a terse \"Sir.\" On X, Benedict joked that for everyone closely watching the testimony from one of the FTC's star witnesses, it was \" the 'Sir' heard round the world.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Bethesda isn’t shutting down ambitious fan-made “Skyblivion” remaster project",
    "article_text": "\"Bethesda has always been supportive of community projects like ours...\" Bethesda fans are understandably excited about the opportunity to revisit the world of Cyrodiil withyesterday's heavily telegraphed release ofThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered. But that excitement may have been tinged with at least a little bit of trepidation for the team behindSkyblivion, a volunteer-run project that hasspent yearstrying to \"port and rebuild\" 2007'sOblivioninto the updated engine from 2016's remasteredSkyrim: Special Edition. Fortunately for the Skyblivion team, Bethesda has apparently decided there's room enough in this world for both official and unofficial remakes ofOblivion. The teamtook to social media Tuesdayto thank Bethesda for \"their continued support\" and for \"the generous gift ofOblivion Remasteredgame keys for our entire modding team.\" \"To clear up any confusion Bethesda made it clear that they have no intention of shutting down our project,\" the teamadded in a social media reply. Earlier this month, when credible rumors of the officialOblivionremaster were running rampant, the Skyblivion teampostedthat it was \"eagerly aniticipating\" the official release and that there was \"no need for comparisons or a sense of competition between Skyblivion and a potential official remaster.\" That's particularly true, the team wrote, because Skyblivion's PC mod won't be available for console players, who will be able to enjoy Bethesda's official version instead \"Bethesda has always been supportive of community projects like ours, and we don't see that changing anytime soon,\" the team wrote at the time. Other publishers aren't always similarly open to competition from fans, though. Nintendo has longtaken a legal scorched earth approachto a wide variety of fan games that use its licensed characters or trademarks. And last year, Valvealso took stepsto shut down a number of fan remakes of its legacy games. In 2016, Blizzardshut downacoupleof fan-run \"classic\"World of Warcraftservers in the run-up to its announcement ofofficialWorld of Warcraft Classicservers.ActivisionandEAhave similarly shut down modded servers for legacy online titles. Some publishers have mirrored Bethesda's more open approach to modders, though. Segaactively encouragedofficialSteamworks moddingfor some Sega Genesis classics released as PC downloads in 2016. And the heavilyHalo-inspiredInstallation 01continues to thrivewithsomething close to official supportfrom Microsoft and developer 343 Industries, as long as it remains a non-commercial project. As for Skyblivion, while the project's last public road map updateis months oldat this point, the team is still confident it will be able to release a version of its ambitious mod later this year. \"We are confident that players will be the true winners, having the opportunity to experience both a community-driven reimagining and a professional, modern version of this beloved game.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Republican space officials criticize “mindless” NASA science cuts",
    "article_text": "\"Heliophysics is the most unknown—and underrated—part of NASA’s science program.\" In the nearly two weeks sinceArs reportedon the Trump administration's proposed budget cuts for NASA's science programs,scientistsandDemocratic lawmakershave both expressed deep concerns about the future of the space agency. However, in a pattern consistent across a host of issues in which GOP lawmakers do not want to be seen to be publicly criticizing the Trump administration, the response to these sweeping cuts from Republican officials has been much more muted. But this week, three prominent Republican space policy officials broke their silence.In an op-edpublished Tuesday on Real Clear Science, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, former House Chair Robert Walker, and the head of the landing team for NASA for the Trump-Vance transition team, Charles Miller, said they were \"deeply disturbed\" by the proposed cuts. All three men have played an important role in setting Republican space policy over the last decade. The cuts were part of a \"passback\" proposal sent to NASA leadership by the White House Office of Management and Budget two weeks ago. Overall, the White House sought a 20 percent cut for NASA, but by far the deepest cuts were earmarked for the agency's science division: a two-thirds cut to astrophysics, down to $487 million; a nearly 50 percent cut to heliophysics, down to $455 million; a greater than 50 percent cut to Earth science, down to $1.033 billion; and a 30 percent cut to planetary science, down to $1.929 billion. \"Certainly, the space agency needs to modernize and reform practices and personnel management—but not at the expense of world-class science programs,\" the Republican officials wrote this week. \"Deep cuts to NASA’s science programs would be the end of America’s leadership in space science. It would clearly signal to the world (and to America’s children) that America is a declining power.\" The authors note that cuts to heliophysics are especially surprising. This is the study of the Sun and the effects of solar activity, including cosmic rays and space weather, on Earth and other planets. \"Heliophysics is the most unknown—and underrated—part of NASA’s science program,\" they wrote. \"As humanity becomes more dependent on satellite technology, and as we expand into space, we must get much better at predicting space weather. Solar storms and other events dramatically impact Earth’s magnetic fields and atmosphere.\" Gingrich, Walker, and Miller argue that the space agency needs \"rational\" reform rather than \"reckless\" cuts. They say the cost of space missions has been steadily rising and that, as marvelous as the results of the James Webb Space Telescope have been, its cost growth was unsustainable. They add that future large telescopes should be assembled in orbit, and they question the value of a Mars Sample Return mission if NASA is serious about sending humans to the red planet. Their arguments lie well within the regular sphere of debate about the future of NASA. This stands in contrast to the proposed cuts by the Trump administration, which appear to be punitive toward science and intended to close one or more of NASA's science field centers. A 50 percent cut would eviscerate the agency's future science programs and, according to some scientists, would represent an \"extinction level\" event for the agency's exploration of the Solar System and the Universe beyond. The cuts originated within the White House Office of Management and Budget, which is led by Russ Vought. His office has sought deep and devastating cuts across a number of federal agencies that conduct scientific research, including the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health. All of these proposed cuts are not yet final Trump policy and won't be until the President's Budget Request for fiscal year 2026 comes out next month. Following this, the White House will work with Congress to actually set the budget. The US House and Senate each have separate appropriations committees that consider the White House priorities in establishing a final budget that the president must then sign into law. There will be fierce opposition to some of these NASA cuts in Congress. However, one source said the Republican-led US House is likely to go along with many of the Trump administration's cuts. The chair of the House Appropriations Committee, Tom Cole, comes from a deeply red district in south-central Oklahoma. He has indicated that he is likely to support the Trump budget cuts because a majority of his district wants him to carry out the Trump administration's agenda. It is less clear what will happen in the US Senate, which is chaired by Maine Republican Susan Collins, who is more moderate and more likely to listen to her Democratic colleagues. Regardless, it seems clear that President Trump's proposed cuts to NASA are actual rather than performative, and the threat to science is very, very real. For this reason, vocal opposition from influential Republican voices on space policy comes at a helpful time. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "4chan may be dead, but its toxic legacy lives on",
    "article_text": "It is likely that there will never be a site like 4chan again. My earliest memory of4chanwas sitting up late at night, typing its URL into my browser, and scrolling through a thread of LOLcat memes, which were brand-new at the time. Back then a photoshop of a cat saying \"I can has cheezburger\" or an image of an owl saying “ORLY?” was, without question, the funniest thing my 14-year-old brain had ever laid eyes on. So much so, I woke my dad up by laughing too hard and had to tell him that I was scrolling through pictures of cats at 2 in the morning. Later, I would become intimately familiar with the site’s much more nefarious tendencies. It's strange to look back at 4chan, apparently wiped off the Internet entirely last weekby hackersfrom a rival message board, and think about how many different websites it was over its more than two decades online. What began as a hub for Internet culture and an anonymous way station for the Internet's anarchic true believers devolved over the years into a fan club for mass shooters, the central nodeof Gamergate, and the beating heart of far-right fascism around the world—a virus that infected every facet of our lives, from the slang we use to the politicians we vote for. But the site itself had been frozen in amber since the George W. Bush administration. It is likely that there will never be a site like 4chan again—which is, likely, a very good thing. But it had also essentially already succeeded at its core project: chewing up the world and spitting it back out in its own image. Everything—from X to Facebook to YouTube—now sort of feels like 4chan. Which makes you wonder why it even needed to still exist. \"The novelty of a website devoted to shock and gore, and the rebelliousness inherent in it, dies when your opinions become the official policy of the world's five or so richest people and the government of the United States,\" the Onion CEO and former extremism reporter Ben Collins tells WIRED. “Like any ostensibly nihilist cultural phenomenon, it inherently dies if that phenomenon itself becomes The Man.” My first experience with the more toxic side of the site came several years after my LOLcat all-nighter, when I was in college. I was a big Tumblr user—all my friends were on there—and for about a year or so, our corner of the platform felt like an extension of the house parties we would throw. That cozy vibe came crashing down for me when I got doxed the summer going into my senior year. Someone made a “hate blog” for me—one of the first times I felt the dark presence of an anonymous stranger’s digital ire, and posted my phone number on 4chan. They played a prank that was popular on the site at the time, writing in a thread that my phone number was for a GameStop store that had a copy of the ultra-rare video gameBattletoads. I received no less than 250 phone calls over the next 48 hours asking if I had a copy of the game. Many of the 4chan users that called me mid-Battletoadattack left messages. I listened to all of them. A pattern quickly emerged: young men, clearly nervous to even leave a message, trying to harass a stranger for, seemingly, the hell of it. Those voicemails have never left me in the 15 years I've spent covering 4chan as a journalist. I had a front-row seat to the way those timid men morphed into the violent, seething underbelly of the Internet. The throbbing engine of reactionary hatred that resented everything and everyone simply because resentment was the only language its users knew how to speak. I traveled the world in the 2010s, tracing 4chan’s impact on global democracy. I followed it to France, Germany, Japan, and Brazil as 4chan's users became increasingly convinced that they could take over the planet through racist memes, far-right populism, and cyberbullying. And, in a way, they did. But the ubiquity of 4chan culture ended up being an oddly Pyrrhic victory for the site itself. Collins, like me, closely followed 4chan's rise in the 2010s from Internet backwater to unofficial propaganda organ of the Trump administration. As he sees it, once Elon Musk bought Twitter in 2022 there was really no point to 4chan anymore. Why hide behind anonymity if a billionaire lets you post the same kind of extremist content under your real name and even pays you for it? 4chan’s “user base just moved into a bigger ballpark and started immediately impacting American life and policy,\" Collins says. \"Twitter became 4chan, then the 4chanified Twitter became the United States government. Its usefulness as an ammo dump in the culture war was diminished when they were saying things you would now hear every day on Twitter, then six months laterout of the mouthsof an administration official.\" But understanding how 4chan went from the home of cat memes to a true Internet bogeyman requires an understanding of how the site actually worked. Its features were often overlooked amid all the conversations about the site's political influence, but I'd argue they were equally, if not more, important. 4chan was founded by Christopher “Moot” Poole when he was 15. A regular user on slightly less anarchic comedy site Something Awful, Poolecreateda spinoff site for a message board there called “Anime Death Tentacle Rape Whorehouse.” Poole was a fan of the Japanese message board 2chan, or Futaba Channel, and wanted to give Western anime fans their own version, so he poorly translated the site's code and promoted his new site, 4chan, to Something Awful's anime community. Several core features were ported over in the process. 4chan users were anonymous, threads weren't permanent and would time out or \"404\" after a period of inactivity, and there were dozens of sub-boards you could post to. That unique combination of ephemerality, anonymity, and organized chaos proved to be a potent mix, immediately creating a race-to-the-bottom gutter culture unlike anything else on the web. The dark end point of the techno-utopianism that built the Internet. On 4chan you were no one, and nothing you did mattered unless it was so shocking, so repulsive, so hateful that someone else noticed and decided to screenshot it before it disappeared into the digital ether. \"The iconic memes that came out of 4chan are because people took the time to save it, you know? And the fact that nobody predicted, nobody could predict or control what was saved or what wasn't saved, I think, is really, really fascinating,\" Cates Holderness, Tumblr's former head of editorial, tells WIRED. Still, 4chan was more complicated than it looked from the outside. The site was organized into dozens of smaller sections, everything from comics to cooking to video games to, of course, pornography. Holderness says she learned to make bread during the pandemic thanks to 4chan's cooking board. (Full disclosure: I introduced Holderness to 4chan way back in 2012.) \"When I switched to sourdough, I got really good pointers,\" she says. Holderness calls 4chan the Internet's “Wild West” and says its demise this month felt appropriate in a way. The chaos that defined 4chan, both the good and the very, very bad, has largely been paved over by corporate platforms and their algorithms now. Our feeds deliver us content; we don't have to hunt for it. We don't have to sit in front of a computer refreshing a page to find out whether we're getting a new cat meme or a new manifesto. The humanness of that era of the web, now that 4chan is gone, is likely never coming back. And we'll eventually find out if that's a good thing or a bad thing. \"The snippets that we have of what 4chan was—it's all skewed,” Holderness says. “There is no record. There's no record that can ever encapsulate what 4chan was.\" This story originally appeared onwired.com. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

If this is your first run at owning a bike that gets ridden frequently, the below is a good starting point to keep you (and your cargo) safe—and your bike running. I once was asked by another cargo bike dad, “Are people wearing helmets on these? Is that uncool?” “You're already riding the uncoolest bike on earth—buy a helmet,” I told him. For the most part, any helmet you pick up at a big box store or your local bike shop will do a perfectly fine job keeping your brains inside your skull. Even so,the goodly nerds over at Virginia Tech have partnered with the Insurance Institute for Highways Safety (IIHS) to rate 238 bike helmets using the STAR evaluation system. Sort by your use case and find something within your budget, but I’ve found that something in the $70–$100 range is more than adequate—any less and you're sacrificing comfort, and any more and you won't notice the difference. Save your cash. Giro, Bell, Smith, POC, and Kask are all reputable brands with a wide range of shapes to fit bulbous and diminutive noggins alike. Additionally, helmets are not \"buy it for life\" items—manufacturers recommend replacing them every four to five years because the foam and glues degrade with sun exposure. So there's a built-in upgrade cycle on that one. Many cargo e-bikes come with front and rear lights prewired into the electric system. If you opted for an acoustic bike, you’ll want to get some high-lumen visibility from dedicated bike lights (extra bike nerd bonus points fora dynamo system). Front and rear lights can be as cheap as you need or as expensive as you want. Depending on the brands your local bike shop carries, you will find attractive options from Bontraeger, Lezyne, and Knog. Just make sure whatever you’re buying is USB-rechargeable and has the appropriate mounts to fit your bike. Additionally, you can go full Fast and the Furious and get nuts with cheap, adhesive-backed LEDs for funandsafety. I’ve seen light masts on the back of longtails, and I have my Long John blinged out with LEDs that pulse to music. This is 82 percent for the enjoyment of other bike parents. You will inevitably blow a tire on the side of the road, or something will rattle loose while your kid is screaming at you. With this in mind, I always have an everything-I-need kit in a zip-top bag in my work backpack. Some version of this assemblage lives on every bike I own in its ownseat bag, but on my cargo bike, it’s split between the pockets of the atrociously expensive but very well thought-outFahrer Panel Bags. This kit includes: Lezyne is a ubiquitous name in bike accessories, and for good reason. I’ve had the previous version of theirPocket Drivemini pump for the better part of a decade, and it shows no sign of stopping. What sets this pump apart is the retractable reversible tube that connects to your air valve, providing some necessary flexibility as you angrily pump up a tire on the side of the road. I don’t mess with CO2 canisters because I’ve had too many inflators explode due to user error, and they’re not recommended for tubeless systems, which are starting to be far more common. If you spend any amount of time on bike Instagram and YouTube, you've seen pocketable USB-rechargeable air compressors made to replace manual pumps. We haven't tested any of the most common models yet, but these could be a solid solution if your budget outweighs your desire to be stuck on the side of the road. Depending on the style and vintage of your ride, you’ll have at least two to three different-sized bolts or connectors throughout the frame. If you have thru-axle wheels, you may need a 6 mm hex key to remove them in the event of a flat.Crank Brothersmakes what I consider to be the most handsome, no-nonsense multi-tools on the market. They have tools in multiple configurations, allowing you to select the sizes that best apply to your gear—no more, no less. As long as you’re not counting grams, the brand of bike tube you use does not matter. Make sure it’s the right size for your wheel and tire combo and that it has the correct inflator valve (there are two styles: Presta and Schrader, with the former being more popular for bikes you’d buy at your local shop). Just go into your local bike shop and buy a bunch and keep them for when you need ’em. The Park Tool patch kit has vulcanization glue included (I’d recommend avoiding sticker-style patches)—they’re great and cheap, and there’s no excuse for excluding them from your kit. Park Tool makes some really nice bike-specific tools, and they produceThis Old House-quality bike repair tutorials hosted by the GOAT Calvin Jones. In the event of a single failure, many riders find it sensible to simply swap the tube and save the patching for when they're back at their workbench. With that said, because of their weight and potentially complicated drivetrains, it can be a bit of a pain to get wheels out of a cargo bike to change a tire, so it's best to practice at home. If you’re regularly locking up outside an office or running errands, you’re going to need to buy (and learn to appropriately use) a lock to protect your investment. I’ve been a happy owner of a few Kryptonite U-Locks over the years, but even these beefy bois are easily defeated by a cordless angle grinder and a few minutes of effort. These days, there are u-locks fromAbus,Hiplok, andLiteLokwith grinder-resistant coatings that are eye-wateringly expensive, but if your bike costs as much as half of a used Honda Civic, they're absolutely worth it. Though you may not always carry stuff, it’s a good idea to be prepared for the day when your grocery run gets out of hand. A small bag with a net, small cam straps, and various sizes of bungee cords has saved my bacon more than once. Looking for a fun gift for the bike parent in your life? Overengineered, beautifully finished cam buckles fromAustere Manufacturingare the answer. Depending on whether we’re on an all-day adventure or just running down to school, I have a rotating inventory of stuff that gets thrown into the front of my bike with my daughter, including: And even if it’s not particularly cool, I like to pack a camping blanket like aRumpl. By the time we’re on our way home, she is invariably tired and wants a place to lay her little helmeted head. When I first started riding, it didn’t occur to me that one should check their tire pressure before every ride. You don’thaveto do this if your tires consistently maintain pressure day-to-day, but I’m a big boy, and it behooves me to call this out. That little pump I recommended above? You don’t want to be using that every day. No, you want what’s called a floor pump. Silcamakes several swervy versions ranging from $150 all the way up to $495. With that said, I’ve had theLezyne SportFloor Drivefor over 10 years, and I can’t imagine not having it for another 20. Mine has a wood handle, which has taken on some patina and lends a more luxurious feel, and most importantly, it’s totally user-serviceable. This spring, I regreased the seals and changed out the o-rings without any special tools—just a quick trip to the plumbing store. I was also able to upgrade the filler chuck to Lezyne’s new right-angle ABS 1.0 chuck. No matter what floor pump you go for, at the very least, you’ll want to get one with a pressure gauge. Important tip: Do not just fill your tires to the max pressure on the side of the tire. This will make for an uncomfortable ride, and depending on how fancy of a wheelset you have, it could blow the tire right off the rim. Start with around 80 PSI with 700x28 tires on normal city roads and adjust from there. The days of busting your back at 100 PSI are over, gang. Even if you don’t plan on wrenching on your own bike, it’s handy to have the right tools for making minor fit adjustments and removing your wheels to fix flats. The most commonly used bolts on bikes are metric hex bolts, with Torx bolts used on high-end gear and some small components. A set ofBondhus ball-end Allen wrencheswill handle 99 percent of what you need, though fancy German tool manufacturerWera makes some legitimately drool-worthy wrenches. If you have blessed your bike with carbon bits (or just want the peace of mind that you’ve cranked down those bolts to the appropriate spec), you may want to pick up a torque wrench. They come in a few flavors geared at the low-torque specs of bikes, in ascending price points and user-friendliness:beam-type,adjustable torque drivers, andratcheting click wrenches. All should be calibrated at some point, but each comes with its own pros and cons. Keep in mind that overtightening is just as bad as undertightening because you can crack the component or shear the bolt head off. It happens to the best of us! (Usually after having said, “I don’t feel like grabbing the torque wrench” and just making the clicking sound with your mouth). Keeping your chain (fairly) clean and (appropriately) lubricated will extend its life and prolong the life of the rest of your drivetrain. You’ll need to replace the chain once it becomes too worn out, and then every second chain, you’ll want to replace your cassette (the gears). Depending on how well you’ve cared for it, how wet your surroundings are, and how often you’re riding, an 11-speed chain can last anywhere from 1,000 to 1,500 miles, but your mileage may vary. You can get the max mileage out of your drivetrain by periodically wiping down your chain with an old T-shirt or microfiber towel and reapplying chain lube every 200–300 miles, or counterintuitively,morefrequently if you ridelessfrequently. Your local shop can recommend the lube that best suits your climate and riding environment, but I’m a big fan ofRock’n’Roll Extremechain lube for my more-or-less dry Northern California rides. The best advice I’ve gotten is that it doesn’t matter what chain lube you use as long as it’s on the chain. Also, do not use WD-40. That is not a lubricant. That’s it! There may be a few more items you'll want to add over time, but this list should give you a great start.

    "title": "Tesla’s Q1 results show the financial cost of Musk’s support for Trump",
    "article_text": "As Elon Musk helps undo regulations, regulatory credits keep Tesla profitable. Tesla managed to hold onto profitability in the first quarter of 2025—but only just.Earlier this month, the automaker reported double-digit declines in both production and delivery numbers thanks to the impact of CEO Elon Musk'scentral rolein the Trump administration, a global trade war, and an increasingly outdated and tiny product lineup. Yesterday, we saw the true cost of those factors whenTesla publishedits profit and loss statement for Q1 2025. Total revenues fell by 9 percent year over year to $19.3 billion in Q1. Selling cars accounts for 72 percent of Tesla's revenue, but these automotive revenues fell by 20 percent year over year. Strong growth (67 percent) in Tesla's storage battery and solar division helped the bottom line, as did a modest 15 percent increase in revenue from services, which includes its Supercharger stations, which are now opening to other car brands. But Tesla's expenses grew slightly in Q1 2025, and more importantly, its profitability shrank. Income from operations fell by two-thirds to $399 million, and its operating margin—once as high as 20 percent—has fallen to just 2.1 percent. After the thirdsuccessive fall in a row, the company will start to lose money on every car it sells if this trend continues. Despite all this bad news, the bottom line remains in the black. Ironically, given Musk's role in tearing up environmental protections, it's regulatory credits that have kept the company profitable. Last year, Tesla increased the amount of credits it pulled in by 54 percent to more than $2.7 billion. That trend may accelerate for 2025 as new rules in the European Union incentivize other automakers like Stellantis to pay Tesla to count its electric vehicles as part of their own pool for emissions. But for this quarter, you can thank the changing headwinds here at home. This \"was driven by demand for credits in North America as other automobile manufacturers have scaled back on their battery electric vehicle plans,\" Tesla wrotein its 10-Q. For Q1 2025, Tesla took in $595 million in regulatory credits. Net income amounted to just $409 million. None of this should be cause for concern, unlike the many times in the past that Tesla almost went out of business, Musk told investors on a call last night. \"It's been so many times. This is not one of those times. We're not on the ragged edge of death, not even close,\" he said. The good news—if you're a Tesla investor, at least—is that Musk says he will be spending more time at the electric car company in the coming months. He was hired by President Trump as a \"special government employee,\" a loophole that allows someone to be appointed to a senior government position without any of the congressional scrutiny that would normally accompany such a significant job. The proviso is that such positions can legally only last for 130 days, and Musk should reach that total in the next few weeks. The flip side is that hissecretive involvement with the DOGE wrecking balllooks set to continue. \"I'll have to continue doing it for, I think, probably the remainder of the president's term, just to make sure that the waste and fraud that we stop does not come roaring back, which [it] will do if it has the chance,\" Musk told investors last night. Earlier this month,The New York Timesreported that Musk said his DOGE group would now generate just 15 percent of the vast savings he originally claimed—and even this smaller amount was disputed by the Times. Musk says he expects to still devote 20 to 40 percent of his working time to the government, meaning Tesla must still compete for his attention, alongside SpaceX and other, lesser ventures. Tesla remains \"absolutely hardcore about safety,\" Musk said, despite the Cybertruck being more likely than the infamousFord Pintotoburst into flames. \"We go to great lengths to make the safest car in the world and have the lowest accidents per mile in. So—and look, fewest lives lost,\" Musk said on last night's call. In 2024, an analysis of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's vehicle fatality rate data found that, actually, Tesla wasthe deadliest brand of car on sale in the US. Musk and the other Tesla executives on the call continued to tout the importance of artificial intelligence and autonomous driving to the company's future. Musk described a \"convoy of Teslas\" driving in circles around the company's base in Austin, Texas, to \"figure out long-tail things,\" Musk said. Autonomous or even partially automated driving systems never make it into the list of \"must-haves\" for American car buyers, but Tesla is pinning its hopes on selling such systems here and abroad. In China, Musk described bold user behavior. \"They have a lot of fun with the cars. I saw one guy take a Tesla on—autonomous on a narrow road across like a mountain. And I'm like, \"Very brave person.\" And the Tesla's driving along on a road with no barriers where [if] he makes a mistake, he's going to plunge to his doom,\" he said. Tesla charges almost $9,000 for its partially automated driving system in China, which can now no longer be called \"FSD\" or \"Full Self Driving\" in the country.Earlier this week, the Chinese government banned misleading terms like \"smart\" or \"autonomous\" in vehicle advertising. And Tesla's domestic rivals like Zeekr and BYD—which now outsell the American company—are giving away their own partially automated driving systems for free. It all may sound like a great big bucket of bad news for the car company, but the stock market has a different take. \"If this is the worst it gets for Tesla, then certainly there must be some upside for the stock once tailwinds, such as the highly awaited cheaper model and the Robotaxi, finally hit the market later this year,\" wrote Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst atinvesting.com. Predictably, Tesla's stock price has risen steadily in premarket trading immediately after announcing its results.

    "article_text": "This article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. TheNintendo Switch 2 is generating massive hypebut if you haven’t preordered yet, you may want to know that stock is already very low at most retailers. Most retailers have limited allocations andnot every customer is going to be guaranteed a unit at launch. Among the handful of stores still regularly stocking, Walmart is one of the sole retailerswhere you can still preorderand with some added perks that make it your best option. Preorders start on April 24 at midnight Eastern Time (12:00 a.m. ET), the equivalent of 9:00 p.m. Pacific Time on April 23. The sale allows gamers nationwide to place orders from home but the demand is so robust that most retailers will sell out immediately. Walmart has a steady supply of both the standard Nintendo Switch 2 console at $449and the Mario Kart World bundle at $499, and it guarantees the delivery on launch day (June 5). Preorder Switch 2 at Walmart Preorder Switch 2 + Mario Kart at Walmart The offer that truly sets Walmart apart from the other retailers is theguarantee of launch-day delivery which is June 5. Customers preordering through Walmart by 8 a.m. local time on June 4 will have theirconsole delivered for freeby 9 a.m. local time on June 5âlaunch day, no less. That guarantee is a valuable benefit especially when you know that many other retailers can’t promise launch-day delivery due to low inventory. If you don’t want to suffer the frustration of waiting in endless lines or indefinite shipping dates, Walmart is a great choice. The Nintendo Switch 2 console itself is ready with everything necessary for a seamless gaming experience: The box contains the console, Joy-Con 2 controllers (left and right), Joy-Con 2 Grip, Joy-Con 2 Straps, Nintendo Switch 2 Dock, ultra high-speed HDMI cable, AC adapter, and a USB-C charging cable. This means that you can play immediately without the need to make additional accessory purchases. As you probably know the Switch 2 is a significant upgrade from the original: It features a larger, crisper 7.9-inch 1080p display for handheld play and 4K output when docked to a TV which offers stunning visuals, and HDR support. The console also boasts improved processing capabilities for smoother gameplay and faster load times, along with improved audio for a better overall experience. With demand through the roof and supplies limited,most retailers will sell out shortly after preorders open. Walmart is one of the few places accepting preorders but make sure you get yours before it runs out of stock (like it’s the case in the UK). If you want to reserve your place as one of the earliest to receive the Switch 2 when it’s released on June 5, your best bet is to act quickly and go with Walmart.

    "title": "The Most Exciting Animation and Events Coming to Annecy 2025",
    "article_text": "The slate of animation coming to France’s annual Annecy Festival, running June 8-15,has been announced. And with it comes a lot of exciting presentations from global studios big and small celebrating the timelessness and reach of the medium around the world. Disney, Netflix,Warner Bros. Animation, DreamWorks, and Sony Animation are among the larger studios making a splash at the festival, including anticipated projects fromStar Wars,Stranger Things,Marvel, and DC. None other than Bugs Bunny himself, drawn in classic 2D by Warner Bros.â Hanna-Barbera Studios Europe, presented the Annecy trailer this year. The delightful short ad was directed by Grant Orchard (Hey Duggee) with executive producer Ben Bocquelet(The Amazing World of Gumball)with Eric Bauza voicing WB’s iconic character. It’s got us really excited for the annual international event and hopeful for more of the Looney Tunes’ presence during the ceremonies. Here are some of the titles we’re most excited to see and learn more about. Fans of the anthology series will get an early peek at season three, whicharrives in Octoberand is led by Japanese animation houses. The specific short getting an Annecy spotlight, “Black,” is directed by Shinya Ohira and centers “a psychedelic battle between past and present, light and dark, and life and death plays out in the haunted psyche of an Imperial trooper who is on the cusp of defeat.” Pixar CCO Pete Docter(Monsters, Inc., Up, Inside Out, Soul)will be presenting a showcase of the studio’s upcoming slate includingElio, Hoppers,andToy Story 5.ÂThe festival will also celebrate 30 years ofToy Storywith new behind-the-scenes look at the CG animated film that started it all. Walt Disney Animation Studios’ CCO and award winning director-writer Jared Bush (Encanto, Zootopia, Moana) will appear at Annecy for the first time to give a sneak peek atZootopia 2. Marvel Animation will host a special “making-of session” that will double as an exclusive premiere screening of the first episodes of itsBlack Pantheruniverse seriesEyes of Wakanda.“The story follows the adventures of brave Wakandan warriors throughout history. In this globe-trotting adventure, the heroes must carry out dangerous missions to retrieve Vibranium artifacts from the enemies of Wakanda. They are the Hatut Zaraze and this is their story.” The series hits Disney+ in August. The Simpsonscreator Matt Groening, executive producer and showrunner Matt Selman, and animator David Silverman are set to be honored at the festival for the longest-running animated show’s achievements in the arts. A panel will “offer a rare insight into the groundbreaking legacy ofThe Simpsonsin animation,” among other events that will take attendees behind the scenes of modern pop culture’s first family of animation. The creators behindMerry Little Batmanincluding director Mike Roth will lift the lid on the caped crusader and son’s continuing adventures withBat-Fam. A conversation between creators of Cartoon Network’s most formative animation shows during its first 25 years, including Gendy Tartakovsky (Dexterâs Laboratory), Craig McCracken (The Powerpuff Girls), Pendleton Ward (Adventure Time), Rebecca Sugar (Steven Universe), J.G. Quintel (Regular Show), andÂ  Adam Muto (Adventure Time: Fionna and Cake). Stranger Things: Tales from ’85showrunner Eric Robles will be on hand to give the world a first look at the animated show in the universe ofStranger Things. The streaming platform will also give a peek atÂ  brother and sister adventure feature fantasy filmIn Your Dreams,Âwhich centers around the siblings going dream-hopping to find the sandman. Andy Serkis’ adaptation ofÂ  George Orwell’s ever-so timelyAnimal FarmÂwill make its debut at Annecy as an official selection screening event. The film is directed by Serkis, written by Nick Stoller, produced by Aniventure and Imaginarium with CG production by Cinesite. This looks unhinged as beloved animeNarutosees a collab with Oasis “celebrating manga culture with an animated film inspired by the openings, taking the audience into an epic adventure alongside the Oasis mascots. This project pays tribute to the aesthetic and narrative codes of anime, captivating manga fans.” The all-animal animated sports featureGoatfrom Tyree Dillihay and co-director Adam Rosette will be featured at the festival. No word on anySpider-Verseaction, however. The Bad Guys 2will make its debut at the festival. We’re hoping there will be some sort of update onThe Wild Robot 2, which we’re eagerly anticipating.

    "title": "An Unannounced Blade Runner Game May Have Quietly Died in 2024",
    "article_text": "ABlade RunnerÂgamecalledÂTime to Livewas once in development but never officially announcedâand now that title is no more. All that’s left are a few details about what might have been. That’s according toInsider Gaming, which claims the project was in development withUntil DawnÂdeveloper Supermassive Games. It was reportedly a character-focused action-adventure title where players would take on the role of So-Lange, the sole Blade Runner existing in 2065 “well beyond their limited lifespan.” Pre-production allegedly began in late 2024, with several staff on 2023’sThe QuarryÂinvolved. Had Supermassive gone into full production, the aim was for the game to release in fall 2027 for PC and current and next-gen consoles. Documents obtained by the outlet mention gameplay would’ve been a mix of stealth, action, exploration, and investigation, similar toCyberpunk 2077Âor theÂDeus ExÂgames. What reportedly didTime to Livein was Alcon Entertainment, which owns the IP. The company allegedly canceled the project late last year, though a specific reason wasn’t given as to why; when asked, Supermassive told Insider Gaming it was “unable to comment.” io9 reached out to both it and Alcon, and the latter acknowledged âdiscussionsâ of aBlade RunnerÂproject last year that âdid not proceed for business reasons.â To date,Blade Runnerhas had three video games. The 1985 game was a shoot-em-up loosely inspired by the film, and the 1997 title was a point-and-click adventure. Then, 2018’sRevelationsÂwas a VR title from Seismic Games. A few years ago, Annapurna Interactive revealed it was developingBlade Runner 2033: Labyrinth,its first in-house game. However, that project’s status is unclear following the developer’sinternal collapsein late 2024.

    "title": "Gamers Are Mobbing Nintendo Switch 2 Preorders Worldwide Despite Calls to ‘Drop the Price’",
    "article_text": "Absence only makes the heart grow fonder. If that idiom holds true, it means bad tidings for Americans looking to get their hands on theSwitch 2. U.S. and Canada-based Nintendo fans will be some of the last in the world to have the opportunity topreorder the Nintendo Switch 2at 12:00 a.m. ET on Thursday, April 24. If you want an inkling of how hectic events will be this week, take a gander at the hysteria of worldwide Switch 2 preorders. Nintendo itself indicated that even preorders through the My Nintendo Store’s anti-scalper âpriority”console lotterymay not guarantee you a first crack atthe new handheldat launch June 5. Though some people onlinecomplained relentlesslyabout the $450 price tag of the Switch 2, Nintendo is already apologizing to people in Japan who may not get a Switch on release day. In apost to X(read via machine translation), Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa said it received âan extremely large number of applicationsâ in Japan alone for its lottery sale of the Switch 2. Approximately 2.2 million people in the country signed up, which âfar exceeds the number of Nintendo Switch 2 consoles that can be delivered from the My Nintendo Store on [release day] June 5.â Furukawa says: Just Japan My Nintendo Store received 2.2 million applications for the lottery sale Those who didn't get picked will be auto carried to the next lottery sale. Even with the second lottery sale they won't be able to accommodate every applied person!This is hype!https://t.co/jszUwkFtAhpic.twitter.com/SmUkmpBBid — Switch 2 Stock (fan account) (@Switch2Stock)April 23, 2025 There will be a second drawing for Switch 2 preorder ticket in the country, but even then Furukawa wrote âwe cannot fulfill all of the applications we received.â The company is bumping up production for Japan. âWe plan to continue producing and shipping a considerable number of Nintendo Switch 2 units in the future,â the Nintendo president said. Nintendo’s priority picks for Switch 2 buyers in the U.S. will be sent out on and after May 8. At least Nintendo is being up front about stock plans, though it may not aid folks overseas. In other countries where Switch 2 preorders already went live, the demand for the new handheld was âcompletely crazy.â That quote comes courtesy of Charlotte Massicault, the head of gaming at French retailer Fnac. Massicault toldFrandroid(read via machine translation) that the first weekend of preorders reached âhistoric levels.â The retailer claimed it opened up preorders on April 2, the same day Nintendo fully unveiled the Switch 2. TheFrench retailerseemed relatively confident Nintendo would avoid a shortage in the country. As with any product release as big as the Switch 2, demand will be different depending on the region. In countries like the UK, where Switch 2 preorders went live April 7, stocks are completely sold out onAmazon(which does not seem to have a U.S.-based page for Switch 2) and retailers likeEEStoreandArgos. That doesnât mean the U.S. will meet the same fate, though it’s a factor of whether Nintendo had enough foresight to guess demand for different regions. Back during the original Switch launch, Nintendo sold around 360,000 units in Japan during the first month of release. Todayâs figures indicate the legacy console maker is seeing many times more demand than its first handheld, but it’s not an apples to apples comparison. Nintendo lists âThe Americasâ as its biggest region for sales, of which the U.S. is the lionâs share of customers eager to snap up whatever the Mario maker provides. The Americas counted for 54.5 million original Switch sales compared to 34 million in Japan, according to Nintendoâslatest sales data. The company does not provide data broken out by country, though the entire European region made up 36 million unit sales over the Switch’s lifetime. Industry analysts have near-universally claimed the Switch 2 will be a big launch. Analysts who spoke to Gizmodo previously said Nintendo had put in more effort than most companies togenerate enough stockof console units for launch on June 5. Other industry insiders claimed Nintendo may have shipped around 137,000 units to the U.S. earlier in the year, before Trump tariffs messed with worldwide supply chains andshunted the Switch 2 preorder date. Still, thatâs a small number compared to how many handhelds Nintendo could sell in June alone. In Nintendoâs last financial earnings report,Furukawaindicated his company had learned from its mistakes with the original Switchâs launch stock woes. He further claimed Nintendo was working to meet âas large a demand as possibleâ for the Switch 2. He also hedged, saying âwe believe it will not be easy to rapidly increase production capacity, so based on our prior experience, we are making preparations to be able to respond as quickly as possible.â U.S.-based preordersgo live at midnight, 12 a.m. ET for Walmart, Best Buy, and Target. GameStop, with its too-good-to-be-true trade-in policy, will start selling Nintendoâs handheld at 11 a.m. ET. If your heart is set on getting a console on release date, you may need to stay up late just to make sure you get your place in line. Or, better yet, avoid the hubbub and buy one when it’s back in stock, though that could be awhile. NintendoNintendo Switch 2 Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Tony Gilroy and Adria Arjona on Andor‘s Dark Season 2 Scene",
    "article_text": "The first season ofÂAndorÂtook moments to show the small waysthe Empireoppresses its people. Season two’spremiere episodescontinue that thread, with the darkest example so far coming in episode three, “Harvest.” Spoilers and a content warning for discussions of assault below. On a farming settlement, Cassian’s old friend Bix Caleen (Adria Arjona) is still recovering from her torture on Ferrix last season. The Empire’s come for a routine inspection (and to find undocumented workers), and an officer has taken a particular interest in her, asking when her “husband” is coming home and casually noting comms have been blocked. He then forces himself on her, resulting in her killing him in a blow to a head and a declaration to the man’s subordinate: “He tried to rape me.” In an interview withthe Hollywood Reporter, Tony Gilroyâthe show’s creator and writer of this season’s first arcâsaid it felt “organic and right” to incorporate the scene, which is part of Bix’s “difficult path” back to herself pre-torture. “I get one shot to tell everything I know or discovered about revolution and battles, with as many incidents I can get in there without having the story tip over,” he explained. “I mean, let’s be honest: in the history of civilization, there’s a huge arterial component of it that’s rape. […] Armies and power throughout history have committed it.” Star WarsÂhas previously touched on sexual assault viaLeia’s slave outfitand mentions of Qi’ra’s backstory inÂSolo, but it’s never shown an attempted assault. Gilroy noted the “very clear” limits of sex and violenceAndorÂis allowed, but otherwise, Disney had no pushback on the scene. In a separate interview withVariety, Arjona recalled a mix of emotions reading and filming the scene. On one hand, she admitted being “really scared” beforehand, but she considered it “really fucking powerful” to get to do it in this franchise. “Bix is in the most vulnerable state she can possible be in, and someone tries to take advantage of her,” she said. “We’ve heard that story many times. The fact that Tony gave it to Bix was a big honorâand it was right.” There was “so much power” felt in declaring the attack an attempted rape, added Arjona, and advised for “any woman, foranyone, when you have a stranger, a male stranger, in your own space, everything becomes survival.” Want more io9 news?

Whether you work from home or you do most of your playing from home, a new monitor is always a good idea. Think of how much you probably look at the screen on a daily basis.

    "title": "Driverless Semi-Trucks Are Coming Soon to a Highway in Texas",
    "article_text": "Driverless big rigs may soon be cruising down a particular highway in Texas. Axioswrites that, later this month, driverless trucks plan to unleash themselves upon a 200-mile stretch of Interstate 45 between Dallas and Houston. Aurora Innovation, a Pittsburgh firm founded in 2017, has developed a truck, outfitted with sensors and specialized software, that can allegedly operate 24/7, with no breaks and no driver, while transporting large amounts of cargo to and fro across America’s freeway system. Aurora has been testing its vehicles in closed environments, and has alsoused “virtual testing” of real-world conditions. Aurora calls its AI-fueled software system the “Aurora Driver,” and plans to have its driverless trucks on the road by the end of the month. According to Axios, the new industry will revolve around a business model in which AI vendors lease their automated software to truck manufacturers, who will then sell the vehicles to logistics companies that need driving fleets. If all of this conjuresFinal Destinationtype scenarios, the companies behind this technology swear it’s safe (andsome data agrees). In fact, one of the advertised benefits of driverless trucks is that they are actuallysaferthan those with someone behind the wheel. “At Aurora, we believe that the benefits of self-driving technology will increase efficiency and mobility, while bringing a reliable driver supply and heightened safety to Americaâs roads,” the company’s website says. “A safer world where goods never stop moving.” Earlier this month, Aurorareleased a reportthat purported to explain how its model of automated big rigs can safely navigate roadways. Many trucks now on the road have extensive safety features including automatic emergency braking and forward collision warning. In 2023 theNHTSA proposed rules to require those safety features on all semis. While self driving cars might appear to make driving safer there’s little data on how safely self driving trucks will operate on a major interstate There’s no telling how those stats might change if you introduce a large numbers of software-guided semis onto a heavily used public roadway. Waymo alreadyoperates on highways and interstates with relative safety, but its vehicles are much less dangerous in a crash than an 18-wheeler with a full load. It should also be pointed out a major incentive for the development of this technology is money, not safety. AI companies are racing to become the first to corner the market for this kind of automation. Trucking companies, meanwhile, have an incentive to invest because it means they won’t have to hire drivers.Given there’s a shortage of drivers, with many blaming low wages and bad hours, driver-less trucks would be a big deal for the industry. Aurora is also currentlysuing a federal automotive safety agency, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. Aurora had requested that the FMCSA exempt it from a federal regulation that stipulates truck drivers must deploy roadside warning devices whenever they’re stopped on the side of the road. Obviously, since Aurora doesn’t have human operators, there would be no one to physically deploy the necessary devices. The FMCSA denied the exemption request, thus sparking the litigation.

    "title": "Vietnamese Vampire Movie Daydreamers Is a Blood-Slicked Guilty Pleasure",
    "article_text": "Daydreamersdoesn’t stray too far fromvampire movienarratives we’ve seen before; there arewarring clansof bloodsuckers, a brother versus brother face-off, and visits to flashy clubs stuffed withfang-faced partiers. But it’s one of very few vampire movies to come from Vietnam, which makes it a curiosity worth seeking out. And once you start watching,Daydreamers‘ stylish execution and ridiculously good-looking cast just might hook you in. What you should not do is spend too much time worrying about the movie’s particular vampire “rules.” Basically, it comes down to this: there are two kinds of vampires roaming around contemporary Ho Chi Minh City. One group clings to the belief that if they resist killing humans and survive instead on animal blood, they may one day reverse the curse and walk freely in the sunlight again. (They are who the movie title refers to, if that wasn’t already obvious.) It’s a lonely, angst-ridden existence, especially for Nhat (Tran Ngoc Vang), who doggedly keeps to his “blood trial” training, hoping to become human again. It’s something his late mother dreamed would be possible for him and his brother, Marco (Thuan Nguyen), but since her death the siblings have become estranged. Marco is now part of thatothervampire clique: flashy, vapid, and glamorous, they have fun living undead life to the fullest and have no desire to revert back to mortality. They give off majorLost Boysvibes. Thanks to the brief animated segment thatDaydreamersopens with, we know that vampires have been around for hundreds of years but were nearly exterminated some time ago by revenge-seeking humans. To ensure their eternal survival, there’s a general shared agreement not to kill any humans, though not everyone sticks to that. An even bigger no-no, however, is letting any non-vampire become aware of vampire existence. “Leave no witnesses” is a sacred creed, though it was either a failing ofDaydreamers‘ subtitles or script that made this point a little confusing, since it seems to create a pretty gaping loophole for that whole “kill no humans” thing. Any vampire who dares spill the secret is also supposed to get taken out, which can be accomplished using silver weapons, a stake through the heart, or good old-fashioned sunlight. Every vampire movie offers its own tweaks on genre lore, andDaydreamersleans really hard into its rules. You kind of wish it had just been “if we don’t kill humans we might heal ourselves” versus “hell yes, kill humans!”âand focused solely on Nhat versus Marco, rather than introducing a plot about Nhat falling for Ha, a human girl (Trinh Thao) he must protect once she accidentally figures out monsters are real. It’s a forbidden romance, butDaydreamersunfortunately provides precious little evidence of sparks between Nhat and Ha, despite the fact that they’re willing to die for each other within days of meeting. There’s a much spicier connection between Marco and vampire queen Trieu (Vietnamese superstar Chi Pu); the latter in particular has a charismatic screen presence that makes you wishDaydreamershad shifted more of its focus her way. At just under two hours,Daydreamershas a lot of time to explore the push and pull between Marco and Nhat, whose shared history goes back over 100 years (at one point, Nhat reveals he was last in school in 1895), but has come to a head with their mother’s tragic passing and Marco’s subsequent transformation into a murderous bad boy. At its core,Daydreamersis mostly fascinated with Nhat’s dilemma: he doesn’t want to die, but even after all this time, he also doesn’t know how to liveâthough he becomes very certain that Marco’s way is not for him. Daydreamerstakes place almost entirely at night, naturally, and it makes good use of that setting to lean into the neon-tinged glamour of eternal debauchery. The “vampire nightclub” trope was used to hilarious effect inWhat We Do in the Shadows, butDaydreamersplays it very straight. Perhaps that’s because the film hails from a culture that hasn’t already done vampire stories to deathâor perhapsDaydreamersis a little too self-serious. Whatever the case, this movie is dripping with blood and eye candy in equal parts, and that’s a praise-worthy achievement even if the plot gets a little wobbly at times. Daydreamersopens in select theaters May 2; it’ll hit all the major VOD platforms June 3. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Pre-order Switch 2: Why You Should Buy It at Walmart and Nowhere Else?",
    "article_text": "This article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. The Nintendo Switch 2 is getting closer to make its grand entrance and for fans looking to lay hands on one,knowing the precise where and when of the preorder is most important. Afteran initial announcementthat preorders would go live on April 9th, Nintendo had to delay the release due to new tariff policies. And then the new date: preorders become available at midnight Eastern Time on April 24, 2025 (12:00 a.m. ET) or 9:00 p.m. Pacific Time on April 23. Of all the stores, Walmart is probably thebest place to preorder the Switch 2. Contrary to what most other stores offer, Walmart has a very promising deal:free and guaranteed delivery as early as 9 a.m. local time on launch day, June 5, to those who preorder by June 4 at 8 a.m. ET. This means that instead of waiting in lines for hours or take a chance with delayed shipping, customers can wake up on the day of launch with their new console in hand already. See Switch 2 at Walmart See Switch 2 + Mario Kart at Walmart The Switch 2 itself includes everything that the players would want, and a little extra. Thepackage contains the console, Joy-Con 2 controllers (left and right), Joy-Con 2 Grip and Straps, Nintendo Switch 2 Dock, ultra high-speed HDMI cable, AC adapter, and USB-C charging cable. Nintendo offers two purchase options (on Walmart or anywhere else): the standard Switch 2 console for $449.99 and a Mario Kart World bundle for $499.99. This bundle includes the console along with the popularMario Kart Worldgame (it can also be bought separately for $79.99, but you get it for $50 if you go for the bundle). See Switch 2 at Walmart See Switch 2 + Mario Kart at Walmart The April 24 pre-order date (instead of the originally scheduled preorder date of April 9) was a bit disappointing to fans worldwide but it was unavoidable due to the tariffs applied by the Trump administration and the impact this would have on prices and supplies. Nintendo hasassured fans that the June 5 release date remains and the first stock is reserved. Demand should be very strong, and there should be little supply, so it is very important to pre-order your Switch 2 early and not miss out. Walmart’s guaranteed 9 a.m. launch day delivery is absolutely fantastic: The deal is worth it considering the predicted surge and potential stock shortages. Best Buy and Target will also be launching preorders at midnight ET on April 24 but Walmart’s delivery guarantee offers unparalleled security. For gamers who want in on the chance of avoiding last-minute purchases or truncated shipping dates, Walmart is a safe bet.

    "article_text": "Black Mirrorfans felt excitement and joyâunfamiliar emotions to associate with the dystopian series, to be honestâupon learning that the show’sseventh seasonwould include a sequel to season four’s “USS Callister.” Now that “USS Callister: Into Infinity” has hit Netflix, putting its cast of humans and digital-clones-trapped-in-a-video-game through a new high-stakes adventure, the question has now become: will there bea third installmentfor “Callister” fans? Jimmi Simpson, who plays Waltonâa character who’s either odious or brave, depending on which version you meetâis 100% enthusiastic about another return. “I would hold the boom mic for [Black Mirrorcreator Charlie Brooker] if he wanted me to,” he toldthe Hollywood Reporterin a new interview. “Iâm in, whatever that is.” Simpson also already has an idea about which character he’d like to see the next “Callister” explore: programmer Dudani, who’s heroic in the game but somewhat morally corruptible in the real world. “I want to know more about Dudani,” Simpson said. “Paul [G. Raymond], the actor who plays him, is really, really gifted. I canât wait to see that character blossom. I feel like thatâs the next one that will really come to life.” The ending of “Into Infinity,” which sees all the digital clones become trapped inside the brain of Nanette (Cristin Milioti), certainly leaves more runway to expand the story. “This ending does throw into question a whole lot of shit long-term for the existence of these people,” Simpson said. “But I think it also is perfect not only inBlack Mirrorworld but also in our world. It says, ‘Okay, so you were unhappy with that? How aboutÂthis? Now, what do you think? Figure it out!'” “There are a lot of unanswered questions, and that is the next step. They stepped outside of this imminent danger and what they have now is each other, truly in a deeper way. And thereâs stuff to explore there. Obviously, we know with personalities forced into this space, thereâs going to be some wild shit. But I really respect this ending very much, and I enjoy it.” Brookerhas saidhe’s considering moreBlack Mirrorsequel episodes, so we may yet learn what’s next for Walton and his friends and frenemies.

    "title": "OpenAI Would Totally Buy Chrome From Google, in Case Anyone Was Wondering",
    "article_text": "As the federal government and Google work through potential remedies for the company’s illegal monopoly over online search, OpenAI is interested in purchasing the Chrome browser, should the court order it be sold off to loosen Google’s grip on the market.According to Bloomberg, Nick Turley, OpenAI’s head of product for ChatGPT, signaled the AI company’s interest in the browser while on the stand testifying at the behest of the Department of Justice. To be fair, OpenAI’s interest in Chrome is not unique. Turley stated “many other parties” would also want to buy the browser should it become availableâand understandably so, seeing as Chrome hasabout 3.45 billion usersglobally and holds a nearlytwo-thirds shareof the browser market. Turley and OpenAI also have another compelling reason to suggest there would be a lot of interest in ChromeâTurley’s testimony could help sway the court’s decision to break the browser free of Google’s control. Whether OpenAI ends up buying it or not, it has a much better shot at doing business with whoever owns a spun-off version of Chrome than with Google, given that it made zero headway trying to get ChatGPT natively integrated into Google’s ecosystem. Earlier in the trial, Turleytestifiedthat search technology would be key to OpenAi’s goal of building a “super assistant,” but Google, who is one of OpenAI’s biggest competitors in the AI space, has shut OpenAI out. Turley laid out some specifics as to why OpenAI would want in on the browser. First and foremost: Distribution. Getting ChatGPT onto more devices has apparently proven a challenge for the company. While it does have integration on iOS devices, Turley claims getting on Android devices has been more difficult, in part because Google allegedly gave some preferential treatment to Gemini, its consumer focused AI product. But also because Google is paying some Android phone makers. The DOJ told the court Monday thatGoogle paidan âenormous sum of money in a fixed monthly payment” to Samsung in order to get Gemini pre-installed on the company’s devices. OpenAI apparently made a bid for that same access, but lost out. Turley said that was “not a lack of trying,”per Bloomberg. Turley also expressed concern that OpenAI “may be shut out” by some of the bigger companies who “control the access points for how people discover products, including our product.” Apple and Google both maintain control of the app stores for their mobile phones which means that Google can prioritize its own product, Gemini, and Apple can prioritize whomever (ChatGPT is currently number two on the iOS Top Free Apps list). This would all probably register as a slightly more genuine concern if OpenAI weren’t also propped up by a$13 billion investment from Microsoft, which has in turnintegrated the startup’s AI model into its search(okay, it’s Bing, but still),browser,AI suite, andstandalone devices. And it’s a little hard to imagine OpenAI would operate Chrome as some sort of bastion of open access and not a way to drive users directly to itsown search product, ChatGPT Search. Heck, if it wanted a browser so badly it could just build one off of Chromium, the open source web browser that’s maintained by Google and used as the foundation for multiple browsers including Microsoft Edge, Opera, and Google Chrome. OpenAI has reportedly considered getting into the browser business already,starting conversations about building its ownback in November of last year. Yet getting its hands on Chrome would kickstart that whole process. But simply getting Chrome out of Google’s hands might be more important to OpenAI. antitrustChromiumGoogleGoogle ChromeOpenAI Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Ghost of Yotei Will Slash It Up on PlayStation 5 in October",
    "article_text": "What a year for games based in Japan and featuring samurai, huh? AfterÂAssassin’s Creed ShadowsÂin March, players can look forward to the PlayStation 5 exclusiveÂGhost of YÅteiOctober 2. Developed by Sucker Punch, the game takes place in 1603 Japan, over 300 years after 2020’sGhost of Tsushima. Players take on the role of Atsu (Erika Ishii), a warrior seeking revenge against the people who killed her family. In the trailer below, we learn about her targets, the YÅtei Six: the Oni, the Snake, the Dragon, the Kitsune, the Spider, and Lord Saito. Armed with the katana Saito used to pin her to the wall during her family’s slaughter, Atsu sets about tracking and cutting them down, adopting the moniker of the Ghost first used byTsushima’sÂprotagonist, Jin Sakai. Like its predecessor,YÅteiÂis an open-world game, and players will explore Ezo (now Hokkaido), taking on contracts and killing enemies in various forms of combat. Unlike Jin, Atsu has dual katanas and other tools at her disposal like a gun, an odachi, and a wolf buddy that can attack enemies. There’s a lot of overlap between this andÂShadows,Âthe key difference beingYÅteiÂplayers can be led to their objective via the way the wind blows. It’s a small thing, but it gaveÂTsushimaÂa lot of charm and highlighted the beauty of its recreated island, so it’s nice to see that return here. Ghost of YÅteiwill initially be exclusive to the PlayStation 5, but a PC release is likely some time after its release. PlayStation’s previously expressed hope this’ll be big enough to adapt into a movie or film, so keep that in your mind when you eventually play it. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Egyptologist in Paris Discovers Secret Messages on the Luxor Obelisk",
    "article_text": "In 1830, the viceroy of Egyptgifted Francea 3,300-year-old Egyptian obeliskâa carved stone pillar with a pyramidal top.In 1836, the obelisk found its home in Paris, in Place de la Concorde. One would think that after standing in the center of the French capital for almost 200 years, Parisian Egyptologists would have learned all there is to discover about the ancient monument. But it turns out the famous obelisk still has its secrets. Jean-Guillaume Olette-Pelletier, an Egyptologist and cryptologist from the Catholic University of Paris, claims to have discovered seven previously undocumented messages carved into the 13th-century BCE Luxor Obelisk. Altogether, the inscriptions were intended to establish Pharaoh Ramses II’s divine authority in the eyes of the ancient Egyptian elite. The discovery and its interpretation were first reported byFrench media, and the researcher aims to further detail his findings in a paper forthcoming in the journal ENiM (Egypt of the Nile and Mediterranean). Olette-Pelletier identified the inscriptions in December 2021, when the obelisk was surrounded by renovation scaffolding. The scaffolding allowed Olette-Pelletier to observe the monument’s highest inscriptions, close to its golden pyramid-shaped top. According toEuroWeekly, it was when Olette-Pelletier attempted to read the hieroglyphs horizontally, rather than vertically, that he began to spot previously unidentified inscriptions. Some (perhaps all) of the new messages were hidden in the hieroglyphs themselves, a technique known as “crypto-hieroglyphs” used by the ancient Egyptian elite that today only six Egyptologists in the world are able to interpret, according toLa BrÃºjula Verde. “People had not noticed that under [one of the drawings] of the god Amun, there is an offering table. This allows us to discover a sentence where no element is missing: an offering that the king gives to the god Amun,” Olette-Pelletier toldBFMTV. Combinations of the newly identified inscriptions produce additional meanings in what’s called three-dimensional cryptography. In total, the Egyptologist identified seven encrypted messages across the obelisk’s various facades. He explained that the enigmatic text can only be understood by walking around the monument. Additionally, the messages in question can only be seen from a specific angle. In particular, when the obelisk stood at the entrance of Egypt’s Luxor Temple, one of the messages would have been visible to vessels sailing on the Nile, according to EuroWeekly. This suggests that the message, exalting Pharaoh Ramses IIâs divine power, was intended for elite individuals arriving by boat. Another inscription encourages viewers to make divine offerings to appease the gods’ anger. Overall, the secret inscriptions highlight Ramses II’s power, victories, longevity, and his appeasement of the gods through word-play from well-known papyrus texts. âThese messages are a form of propaganda in favor of the builder of the site: Pharaoh Ramses II,â Olette-Pelletier told Le Point. He argues that Ramses II wanted to further legitimize his divine claim to power in the eyes of the noble class, as reported by EuroWeekly. Ramses II ruledfrom 1279 to 1213 BCEand is one of ancient Egypt’s most famous pharaohs. The Luxor Obelisk in Paris is one of two that he erected at the entrance of what today is known as the Luxor Templeâthe second obelisk remains in Egypt. Ultimately, Olette-Pelletierâs discovery highlights that even the most familiar ancient monuments still hold secrets left for us to unravel.

Researchers compared puncture marks on an 1,800-year-old skeleton in the UK to various animal bites, and concluded that the individual was likely bitten by a lion. A construction project in Stuttgart, Germany, resulted in the discovery of the ancient site. Archaeological records indicate that prehistoric people in Europe relied on fire throughout the Ice Ageâbut the evidence drops off during its harshest period. The remains belonged to around 150 men between the ages of 20 and 30âall victims of a fierce battle. The artifacts reveal the harsh working conditions in ancient Egyptian gold mines under the rule of the Ptolemaic dynasty. Two archaeologists discovered the ceramic figurinesâpossibly used as puppetsâat the top of a pyramid, and three of them have adjustable heads.

    "title": "Elon Musk’s Pledge to Step Away From DOGE Sounds Like Word Games",
    "article_text": "Elon Musk soundedextremely depressedon Tesla’s earnings call Tuesday after the EV company reported a 71% drop in profits last quarter. But one of the big headlines you’re seeing everywhere is this claim that Musk is leaving his role in President Donald Trump’s government as the head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). And while it’s something Musk really did say, it’s worth taking a closer look at the exact words he used. Because just like everything else the billionaire oligarch promises, this claim needs to be treated with some healthy skepticism. “The large slug of work necessary to get the DOGE team in place and working in the government, to get the financial house in order, is mostly done,” said Musk. “And I think… starting… probably in, next month, in May, my time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly.” That’s the news that everyone seemed to focus on. Musk is leaving DOGE and going to pay more attention to his several companies, including not just Tesla but X and SpaceX. Maybe Musk will even devote more time to his more neglected ventures like The Boring Company. But what got less attention was the line Musk followed up with. “I’ll have to continued doing it for, I think, probably the remainder of the president’s term just to make sure that the waste and fraud that we stopped does not come roaring back, which will do if it has the chance,” Musk continued. Musk then elaborated on how much time he will actually be working on government issues, which he thinks will be a day or two during each week. “So I think I’ll continue to spend a day or two per week on government matters for as long as the president would like me to do so and as long as it is useful,” said Musk. “But starting next month I’ll be allocating far more of my time to Tesla and… now that the major work of establishing the Department of Government Efficiency is done.” Musk didn’t address the fact that he’s classified as a Special Government Employee (SGE), which allows him to sidestep financial and ethical disclosure rules, but has a hard deadline for when he’s supposed to exit from his role. SGEs can’t work for more than 130 days in any 365-day period. Musk has worked about 90 days as an SGE if we start counting from the inauguration on Jan. 20, but many people don’t seem to be realizing the tricks Musk could play. What if Musk suddenly decided to say that he wasn’t actually working for the government for half of those days or more? Who’s actually going to audit that? Musk’s insistence that he’s only going to work one or two days a week feels like he’s showing his cards. Two days a week for 52 weeks in the year brings us to 104 days. And who’s to say what counts as “work” in Musk’s eyes? If he only devotes a few hours each day to government work but does that for seven days a week, does that count as seven days or does he need to accumulate 24 hours of work to count as a full day? You can see how these guys could play around with semanticsâtechnically following the letter of the law while violating the spirit of the law. Musk frequently says he works 14-16 hours per day, but we know from his livestreams andreporting from Washingtonthat he plays a lot of video games. Does his time playing video games count as work if he’s listening to a conference call or something while he does it? There are way too many loopholes to count at this point when you think of how Musk might add up his days as a Special Government Employee. The billionaire hasn’t actually declared how many days he thinks he’s “worked” for the government so far this year. Officially, the Trump regime insists incourt filingsthat Musk isn’t even an employee of DOGE, let alone its leader. It’s a bald-faced lie, given the fact that Trump and Musk never played along with that ridiculous idea. But it presumably insulates Musk from legal exposure for all the clearly illegal shit he’s been doing. For example, DOGE has completely abolished the U.S. Agency for International Development, which he has no authority to do. Only Congress can create or dispose of entire federal agencies. The audio of Musk talking about his potential exit from the Trump regime isworth listening to, if only because the written word doesn’t properly communicate just how uncertain the billionaire sounds when he was talking on Tuesday. Musk pauses for long periods, sounding incredibly downtrodden and perhaps trying to collect his thoughts or choose his words carefully. We’ve clipped the relevant portion below and it’s weird to hear for yourself. Tesla is clearly hurting as a direct consequence of Musk’s own choices and how people view his brands. The Tesla CEO has embraced Trump, had a direct role in destroying the government, and constantly shares his far-right views on X. But Musk doesn’t think a rejection of his ideas, and by extension Tesla, could possibly be an organic display of disgust by the public. The billionaire opened his earnings call by insisting that protesters at his dealerships were all paid by nefarious forces who were actually just upset that he’s cutting “waste” and “fraud” in the federal government. “The real reason for the protests, the actual reason, is that… those receiving the waste and fraud wish to continue receiving it,” Musk said. “That is the real thing that’s going on here. Obviously.” If we’re going to get into what’s “obvious,” it would seem much more apparent that Musk’s fascism is playing a role. This is the guy who made twoNazi-style salutesthe day Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20. While he would later deny that’s what he was doing, the vast majority of people know what they saw. Will Musk actually step away from DOGE? It’s entirely possible. Especially if the billionaire has outlived his usefulness to Trump. There have been countless reports from inside the White House that Musk has annoyed Trump, but so far they’veneeded each otherto achieve their fascist goals. Musk has likely gained unique insights into federal contracts as he and his band of DOGE dipshits ransack government data. That kind of god-view access is pretty much unprecedented for a private contractor who relies heavily on government money. Musk is getting tremendous benefits from Trump, even if he has to endure some tariffs imposed by the president that harm his business in the short term. And Trump needs Musk’s political machine to keep members of Congress in line. Musk helped get Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth confirmed by throwing his money and influence around after there were signs Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa wouldn’t help get Hegseth over the finish line. Musk helped fundadsthat called Hegseth a âpatriotâ who was a victim of the âdeep state,” and urged people to call their senators. It successfully got Ernst to play ball, even if Senators Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Susan Collins of Maine all voted against Hegseth, with Vice President JD Vance breaking the tie 50-50 vote. The long and the short of it: We’ll believe Musk is actually leaving government when we see it. Trump and Musk both say a lot of things that don’t turn out to be true.Â Tesla didn’t respond to an email Wednesday asking for more details about Musk’s plan to supposedly step away from DOGE. But that’s not a surprise, given the fact that the company dissolved its media relations department in 2020. Gizmodo will update this post if, by some miracle, we hear back.

    "title": "Roku’s Wireless Outdoor Security Camera Will Keep Streaming for Up to Two Years",
    "article_text": "Most homeowners donât need any high-tech, facial recognition-capable super-sharp 4K outdoor security camera, especially one you need to keep plugged into an outlet. Roku, the brand most known for cheap streaming devices, plans to releasea1080p outdoor camerathat it claims wonât need a charge for up to two years. Still, just like all Roku devices, the hidden price is how much of your privacy youâre willing to give up in the name of cheap tech. The $40 Roku Battery Camera and $60 Roku Battery Camera Plus are the new additions to the cheapo streaming brandâs line of smart cameras that wereÂ first introduced in 2022. While the Rokuoutdoor wired cameraalso offers 1080p streaming, the new, Battery Camera should last six months while the Plus model shouldnât require a charge for close to two years. Already, the small stature, large battery, and low price make Rokuâs outdoor camera extra enticing. It includes WiFi 6 connectivity, but its range will depend on the quality of your WiFi signal. Thereâs no release date yet and Roku said itâs looking at a summer release. Of course, the full battery life depends on how often the motion sensor-activated camera gets triggered. Either way, recharging it only requires you unscrew it from its base and plug it into a USB-C cable. Otherwise, itâs a very basic device, and thatâs to its benefit. It includes basic motion sensing to detect people or animals crossing in its field of view, but it lacksfacial recognition featuresfound on devices likeRing doorbellsand other, higher-end outdoor security cameras. The Battery Camera and Battery Camera Plus work with the Roku Camera app for TV and the Roku Smart Home app on your phone. That will allow you to remote monitor the camera feed or get updates for when the device spots any incoming mailmen or rogue deer stampeding across your lawn. The app defaults to cloud storage, even though youcan back up videosto a microSD card. The companyâsprivacy policyexplicitly states âRoku collects and may review (for example, for content moderation purposes) any files, including photos, videos or audio files, that you choose to upload or make accessible to the Roku Services.â That’s a potential problem considering the lingering privacy issues surrounding outdoor smart cameras. Although it lacks facial recognition, there’s still a chance police may seek to access that footage through Roku. Police can request cloud video footage in cases of emergencies. We reached out to Roku to learn if it has any policy about offering data to police on request, but we did not immediately hear back. Weâll update this post when we learn more. Roku reps also told Gizmodo the outdoor camera isnât currently Matter compatible, but it may get connections to different apps when Matter comes to fully support smart security cameras. Roku announced a few other new products on Wednesday, including that it’s working with outside OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) on Roku-enabled projectors. This may mean you no longer would need to stick a streaming stick into your projector or operate two separate remotes. Thereâs no word on when those projectors may come , but at least thereâs all-new, ultra-cheap streaming sticks available. The new Roku streaming sticks include a $30 entry-level Streaming Stick for HD alongside a $40 Streaming Stick Plus for 4K content. The box comes with the dongle, plus the Roku voice remote, though it lacks the HDR support of the more-expensive $50 Roku Streaming Stick 4K or the $100 Roku Ultra. The Streaming Stick Plus essentially replaces the Roku Express 4Kâthe companyâs previous smaller-sized set top box. The company claimed that these new streaming sticks should be power efficient enough that the vast majority of TVs should offer enough juice through a USB-A port. Once more, it all seems relatively solid for the price, butâagainâyouâll have to entertain Rokuâs data harvesting practices andpotentially more-obtrusive adsfor the sake of watching all your shows.

    "title": "Meta’s Oversight Board Is Worried Meta’s New Policies Will Harm Human Rights",
    "article_text": "On Wednesday, Meta’s Oversight Board called on the company to evaluate how recent policy change’s may negatively impact human rights. The Board’s request comes alongside its publication of its first 11 case decisions following Meta’ssweeping policy changesat the start of the year. Meta’s January policy changes included overhauling content moderation, lifting restrictions on hot button political topics like immigration, and ending third party fact-checking in favor of X-style community notes.When announcing its policy changes, Meta said that its platforms are meant to be somewhere “people can express themselves freely” â even if things gets ugly.In a video statement, CEO Mark Zuckerberg added that, “[W]e’ve reached a point where it’s just too many mistakes and too much censorship. The recent elections also feel like a cultural tipping point towards once again prioritizing speech.”Â In Wednesday’spress release, the board expressed concern about Meta’s updated policies, noting that “no public information [was] shared as to what, if any, prior human rights due diligence the company performed” before the change. The board called on Meta to address adverse impacts that its policies may have on communities like LGBGQ+ people, including minors, and immigrants. Additionally, the board requested that Meta review the effectiveness of the Community Notes system especially as it pertains to combatting misinformation. As for the decisions themselves, the board sided with Meta on a number of issues, but disagreed on others, echoing their larger concern about potential human rights violations. The board overturned Meta’s decision to keep up three posts related to last summer’s riots in the United Kingdom, stating that “the likelihood of their inciting additional and imminent unrest and violence was significant.” They’ve requested those posts be removed. In separate cases, the board also overturned Meta decision to keep up content “including a racist slur and generalizations of migrants as sexual predators” and noted concerns regarding “dehumanizing speech” about disabled people that the company’s systems failed to detect. However, the board upheld some of Meta’s controversial decisions including allowing two posts about transgender peoples’ bathroom access and participation in sports to remain up. Although the posts are “intentionally provocative…they related to matters of public concern and would not incite likely and imminent violence or discrimination.” The Oversight Board’s requests comes weeks after a former Facebook employee, Sarah Wynn-Williams,released a book recounting her time at the companyand observing a pattern of Zuckerberg announcing new policies without consultation and ignoring potentials harms created by the platform. It’s also only a day after Kevin Systrom, Instagram’s co-founder, testified for the Federal Trade Commission’s lawsuit against Meta. Hestatedthat Instagram received “zero” money Zuckerberg committed to spending in trust and safety resources after the Cambridge Analytica scandal. So, when it comes to safety, Meta isn’t looking good on multiple fronts. Thing is, Meta’s disastrous human rights impacts are already well-documented. For example, it played asignificant role in the Rohingya genocideand issystemically censoring contentabout Palestine. The Human Rights Campaign evenrecognizedthat Meta’s changes “will normalize anti-LGBTQ+ misinformation and intensity anti-LGBTQ+ harassment” and, in February, Amnesty Internationalwarnedthat Meta’s policies may fuel more mass violence and genocide. The board’s request for Meta to assess the impact of its policies is cool and all but it’s unclear what that will really do. After all, Meta’s new policies blatantly use dogwhistle terms like “transgenderism”. and the training materials regardingnewly permissible speechincluded “Immigrants are grubby, filthy pieces of shit”, “Black people are more violent than whites”, or “Trans people are mentally ill” as examples.

    "title": "Lion Bite Marks on 1,800-Year-Old Skeleton Confirm Gladiators Fought in Roman Britain",
    "article_text": "Gladiatorial games are perhaps one of the most iconic and romanticized features of ancient Roman culture. Historical texts, bas-reliefs, pottery, and mosaics depict warriors fighting to the last breath for freedom and glory, often wrangling exotic beasts in front of crowds of cheering fans. While gladiatorial arenas such as the Roman Colosseum have survived for thousands of years, gladiators themselves have left behind little archaeological evidence, and even less that testifies to their legendary animal combats. Researchers in Ireland and the United Kingdom have identified the first physical evidence of ancient Roman human-animal gladiatorial combat in Europe: a human skeleton with bite marks on its pelvis likely from a large cat, unearthed in what is believed to be a gladiator burial outside of York, in the UK. âFor years, our understanding of Roman gladiatorial combat and animal spectacles has relied heavily on historical texts and artistic depictions,” Tim Thompson, an anthropologist at Maynooth University, said in a universitystatement. “This discovery provides the first direct, physical evidence that such events took place in this period, reshaping our perception of Roman entertainment culture in the region.â Archaeologists had previously unearthed the skeleton at the center of thestudy, published today in the journal PLOS ONE, in Driffield Terraceâan approximately 1,800-year-old burial ground that scholars speculate may have served as a gladiator graveyard in Roman Britain. Among other evidence, the numerous skeletal remains belonged to well-built young men from around the empire with various healed injuries. The individual in question was a male between the ages of 26 and 35 with some health issues, and discovered under a layer of horse bones. Led by Thompson, the team of archaeologists and osteologists made a 3D model of punctures in the man’s pelvis. After comparing them to the bite marks of different animals, they concluded that a large cat had been responsible for the lesions, perhaps while scavenging the body after the man’s death. âThe bite marks were likely made by a lion, which confirms that the skeletons buried at the cemetery were gladiators, rather than soldiers or slaves,” Malin Holst, a co-author of the study and an osteoarchaeologist from the University of York, said in a universitystatement. The bite marks “represent the first osteological confirmation of human interaction with large carnivores in a combat or entertainment setting in the Roman world.â The man was likely aBestiariusâtypically criminals or prisoners sentenced to fight against animals, without training or defenses, in front of an audience. “We may never know what brought this man to the arena where we believe he may have been fighting for the entertainment of others,” David Jennings, CEO of York Archaeology, said in a PLOSstatement, “but it is remarkable that the first osteo-archaeological evidence for this kind of gladiatorial combat has been found so far from the Colosseum of Rome, which would have been the classical worldâs Wembley Stadium of combat.â Jennings did not participate in the study. Though archaeologists have yet to uncover an amphitheater in the area, the study nevertheless demonstrates that gladiatorial culture reached the Empire’s farthest corners. It also confirms the presence of social, political, and military elite in Roman York; sections of society that would have required such elaborate and cruel entertainment.

The 3,300-year-old monument has sat in the French capital's center for almost 200 years, but no one else noticed these strange encryptions. A construction project in Stuttgart, Germany, resulted in the discovery of the ancient site. Archaeological records indicate that prehistoric people in Europe relied on fire throughout the Ice Ageâbut the evidence drops off during its harshest period. The remains belonged to around 150 men between the ages of 20 and 30âall victims of a fierce battle. The artifacts reveal the harsh working conditions in ancient Egyptian gold mines under the rule of the Ptolemaic dynasty.

    "article_text": "Last weekend’sStar WarsCelebration Japanfeatured the reveal ofÂMaul: Shadow Lord,Âthe next animatedÂStar WarsÂshow. In it, the former Sith apprentice will build up his enterprise into the Crimson Dawn crime syndicate featured inÂSoloÂandÂStar Wars Outlaws. During the event,IGNspoke with returning voice actor Sam Witwer, who explained the show takes place a year afterStar Wars: The Clone Wars. Maul ended that show leaving Ahsoka and the Order 66-controlled Clones to die, and according to Witwer, the character’s in a “challenging place.” By this point in time, his mother Talzin and brother Savage have both been killed, and he’s been abandoned or betrayed by the allies he made during the Clone Wars. All that, plus Ahsokarejecting his offerto kill Anakin and prevent Palpatine’s ascent, has him wondering what to do in life. “Maul comes from a time of magic… now he’s seeing an Empire he knew was coming, and the magic and color is being sucked out of the universe,” continued Witwer. “How does he feel about that? this different than what he expected and how does he feel that affects him? What does he wanna do about it, and can he? He’s not very equipped right now. So this is a guy who’s trying to figure out what his destiny is.â That destiny, as teased during the trailer at SWCJ, will involve taking on another apprentice teased by Witwer as “quite something.” Tone-wise, Witwer further saidÂShadow LordÂwould have no such redemption play for its title character. “He’s a bad guy in this show,” the actor affirmed. “Our show is bad guys versus worse guys, so Maul is every bit as bad as he was beforeâin some ways even worse.” Maul: Shadow LordÂpremieres in 2026.

    "title": "Nintendo is trying to force Discord to give up the identity of the person behind last year's massive Pokémon leak",
    "article_text": "The 2024 'teraleak' saw a huge trove of previously unreleased Pokémon material released to the public, and Nintendo wants to know who's responsible. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Six months after the massive \"teraleak\" that unleashed literally decades of Pokémon art, design documents, and other development material upon the world, Nintendo is trying to force Discord to give up the identity of the person behind it. As reported byPolygon, the company has petitioned a California court to issue a DMCA subpoena ordering Discord to provide the name, address, telephone number, email address, IP address, \"or other information within your possession, custody or control, sufficient to identify the Discord user or former Discord user 'GameFreakOUT'.\" That's the Discord handle of the person who allegedly hacked Pokémon developer Game Freak and then posted a treasure trove of previously unreleased material ranging from work-in-progress sprites to concept art from the original 1997 anime, design bible lore, and even minutes from a Pokémon Company meeting. This is the first step in a process that could have a very unhappy ending for GameFreakOUT. If the subpoena is issued and Discord complies with it, both of which seem likely (I'm not a lawyer, but I know how these things go), Nintendo will then be able to bring its lawyers to bear on the currently-anonymous leaker. That's not a guaranteed outcome, but the company is notorious for being highly protective of its property, and viciously litigious with those who step out of line. This is where we bring up the case of Gary Bowser, who was sentenced tothree years in federal prison(he ultimatelyserved one) and a $4.5 million fine for selling modchips and jailbreaking software for various Nintendo consoles. That's pretty ruthless, but not enough for Nintendo, which came after him for anadditional $10 millionin a separate civil suit. It's an amount he can literally never pay off, but Nintendo'ssqueezing him for itanyway. If legal action is pursued, the \"teraleaker\" may not face consequences quite that severe: They didn't sell anything, after all. But asPolygonreported in 2021, an earlier Pokémon leak did result in a lawsuit, filed in that case by the Pokémon Company, which left the two leakers involved owing the company $150,000each. Given the much larger scale of the \"teraleak,\" I'll be very surprised indeed if Nintendo doesn't come down hard on whoever pulled it off. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "How to master the persuasion minigame in Oblivion so you aren't constantly eating your words",
    "article_text": "Oblivion's persuasion minigame is pretty weird, but you can learn how to charm just about anyone with enough practice. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Almost everyone ignores the persuasion minigame in Oblivion if given the chance. I don't blame them—it's really weird and doesn't make any sense if you think about it for five seconds. Why the heck would you always need to admire and coerce every person you try to persuade? And yet, I earnestly enjoy this weirdo minigame, so I'll coach you through how persuasion works in Oblivion so you don't put your foot in your mouth every time. This guide is valid for both Oblivion and Oblivion Remastered. Although the remaster uses a visual redesign to make the persuasion minigame just a little easier to understand, the rules are all the same as in the original. Persuasion is an essential tool for gathering info during certain quests. Some NPCs won't talk to you at all or will only give you information you want if their approval rating is high enough. To start persuading an NPC in Oblivion, click the button with a face (original) or silhouette and arrows (remaster) below your dialogue options while in a conversation with them. Oblivion's persuasion minigame is basically a randomized puzzle, admittedly a really weird one. Here are the basic rules: Essentially, Oblivion's persuasion minigame is a strategy-lite brain tickler. Knowing thatyoumustclick all four segments at least onceand that each click will rotate the wheel, your goal is to strategically try to line up the most influential wedges with the topics that NPC likes most while waiting to click their disliked topics when they line up with smaller wedges. Each time you start a persuasion game, begin by quickly hovering over each of the four topics and taking note of the faces they make to see which topics they do or do not like. Now consider the starting position of your wheel wedges. If a hated topic already has a small wedge or a loved topic has a full wedge, click it first to lock that topic in! If the character's most loved topic isn't already in the right position, consider how many quarter turns it will take for it to be in the right position. Dole out your other clicks strategically, going for low bars on hated topics and high bars on liked ones. Oblivion Remastered makes the game just a bit easier by color coding each topic after you've attempted to persuade a given NPC at least once—each topic is red (hate), orange (dislike), yellow (like), and green (love). This means you can visualize their likes and dislikes without having to judge an argonian's facial expressions, though it is annoying that orange and yellow are a bit easy to mix up at a glance. The remaster also turns each wedge into a set of four possible concentric bars, so it's easier to see which pieces have the most influence. Oblivion remastered changes: What's new and what's not?Oblivion console commands: Cheats new and oldOblivion lockpicks: Where and how to use themOblivion vampirism cure: Rid yourself of the afflictionOblivion thieves guild: How to join the crew Just like other skills in Oblivion, you'll earn experience in Speechcraft by using the skill, which includes persuading people. You can unlock a few different benefits that make persuasion easier as you level up. Level Rank Buff 0 Novice No perks 25 Apprentice Disposition decreases more slowly over time when persuading someone 50 Journeyman You can rotate once for free when persuading someone 75 Expert Bribes cost less 100 Master Disposition no longer decreases over time while persuading and is less affected by the least liked topic Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "The new game aims to \"cover the entire world\" of Robert Jordan's book series. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. AVarietyreport says a new videogame based on Robert Jordan's massive Wheel of Time series of books is now in development at a newly established game division of Iwot Studios, one of the production companies responsible for the Wheel of Time TV series on Amazon. The new game, described as a triple-A open-world RPG, will be headed up by former Warner Bros Games vice president Craig Alexander, whose previous credits include The Lord of the Rings Online, Dungeons and Dragons Online, and Batman: Arkham Underworld. Iwot, which acquired the rights to the Wheel of Time property (as Red Eagle Entertainment) in 2004, said the game will be part of its \"multi-platform strategy to expand The Wheel of Time across film, television, and gaming.\" \"It’s an open-world game, and it’ll be everything with the Wheel of Time,\" Iwot Studios CEO Rick Selvage said. \"Everything that is covered in the books, as well as all the backstory elements of it. \"As we build out the world, it’ll be the entire Wheel of Time world, it’s not going to be limited to one area or another or a particular age. Of course, we’ll have opportunity on films, since we’re doing Age of Legends, we’ll have a lot of assets from that and marketing opportunities and fan integration and a lot of other things. But it will cover the entire world.\" Age of Legends is a planned feature film prequel to the Wheel of Time TV series on Amazon. The company is also working on a 3D animated Wheel of Time film at Squeeze Animation Studios, according to the report. This won't be the first Wheel of Time videogame: That honor, as far as I know, goes to Legend Entertainment, which released a Wheel of Time fantasy FPS way back in 1999. It's been a while so details are hazy (pretty much non-existent, really) but I have a vague recollection the game was pretty decent, and it was good enough to warrant aNightdive remasterin 2022. If you're curious, you can pick it up on sale right now for $1.50 onGOG. A release target for the Wheel of Time RPG wasn't announced, but the studio expects it will take roughly three years to develop. It's planned for release on PC and consoles.

    "article_text": "Co-founder Jason Citron is stepping down, but will remain with the company as a member of the board of directors. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Discord co-founder Jason Citron has announced that he is stepping down as CEO, and will be replaced in the position by formerActivisionBlizzard executive Humam Sakhnini. Citron will remain with the company, however, as a member of its board of directors and an advisor to the new chief. Citron's resignation comes a little over a month after the emergence of reports that Discord was making moves towardbecoming a publicly traded company, and that is indeed what's going on: The outgoing CEO said Sakhnini was hired \"to lead Discord through our next chapter of growth and someday becoming a public company.\" \"As we enter our next phase, I’ve been reflecting on how I can best contribute to Discord’s long-term success,\" Citron wrote in a message to Discord employees that was also shared on thecompany's blog. \"The job of a CEO is constantly evolving, and over the years I have continuously 'hired myself out of a job.' Usually that means delegating work and then taking on different leadership challenges. However, as I look at what is needed of Discord’s CEO over the next few years, I realize that it’s time for me to literally 'hire myself out of a job'. \"One thing I know for sure: our company is bigger than any one person. Its future depends not just on me, but on a strong leadership team, a clear vision for what comes next, and all of your incredible talent, care, and hard work. Today’s Discord has all of that. It’s by far the best version of the company we’ve ever had. We have a clear strategy, new business lines to grow into, love and passion from our users, and an incredible team of people working tirelessly to deliver for them.\" Sakhnini definitely seems like a fellow who knows his way around bankers and boardrooms. HisLinkedInpage says he spent eight years at business consulting firm McKinsey and Co. before joining Activision Blizzard as chief strategy and talent officer in 2009. In 2016, following Activision's acquisition of King, he became that company's chief financial officer and then president, a position he held until 2022 when he became vice chairman of Activision Blizzard's board. He left that role in 2023, not long after Microsoft finished its takeover of the company. \"I'm incredibly excited to join Discord at such a pivotal moment,\" Sakhnini said in a separatestatement. \"Discord stands as a massive, foundational part of the gaming ecosystem that millions of players, developers, and publishers rely on every day. What Jason and Discord co-founder and CTO Stan Vishnevskiy have built is truly remarkable—a platform with an undeniable product-market fit where hundreds of millions of people connect around their passion for gaming and shared interests. \"I look forward to working with Stan and Discord's talented team to scale our business while staying true to the company's core mission and the special connection it has with player communities. We're still at the beginning of gaming's impact on entertainment and culture, and Discord is perfectly positioned to play a central role in that future.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Like just about every gaming and gaming-adjacent company in existence, Discord botched the Covid-19 pandemic by grossly overextending itself in unsustainable conditions, after which itlaid off a large number of employeesin pursuit of—you guessed it—\"more agility.\" In May 2024, Discordannounced a new planthat sounded a lot like its old plan: Focus on being a place for people to hang out while they play games online. Whether that focus will hold up once the company is in the hands of institutional investors whose only priority is making numbers go up is a wide-open question and one that, like my compatriot Joshua Wolens, I have grave doubts about.

    "title": "Don't worry, Oblivion Remastered's NPCs are still charmingly ugly, they're just ugly in next-gen ways",
    "article_text": "The new facelifts didn't make them hot or bland, as we feared: now Cyrodiil's citizens have a whole new type of disquieting charm. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The great circle has finally closed. Way back in 2016 I was given a task: findthe ugliest NPC in The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion. Today I'm setting out to do it again in Newblivion, or as it's bafflingly and officially called,Oblivion Remastered. As Tyler wrote last week, he was a bit apprehensive about Newblivion's incoming facelift. Many of the characters in the 20-year-old RPG are uggo, sure, but in a mostly charming way. No one wanted the citizens of Cyrodiilto all suddenly become hotin the remaster. This is Oblivion, after all, not Inzoi. My worry was that they'd becomeStarfieldy: there were so many generic faces in Bethesda's space RPG that they've all blurred together and I can only remember what maybe two or three characters look like despite spending over 100 hours in that game. Would this remaster strip out the unique look of Oblivion's weirdos and make them into a pleasant but forgettable blur? Luckily, neither Tyler's nor my fears were warranted. As I sprinted around Cyrodiil (you can sprint now!) rudely gawking at people's faces from a distance of one millimeter, I quickly discovered the next-gen NPCs of Newblivion look appreciably different than their original counterparts—but they're definitely not sexy and there are still lots of weird, memorable, and mildly disturbing faces. Plenty of wonderful uggos, in other words—they're just uggo in a different way. (And, as I found in my original investigation, there are a bunch of perfectly nice looking folk as well.) My first stop as I burst from Newblivion's sewers with some old man's necklace in my pocket was Bruma, home to Jorck the Outcast, whom I deemed King Ugly back in 2016. He has changed massively in the remaster, no longer owner to \"a weird, tiny fish-mouth that's too far from his giant nose\" as I said in 2016, adding \"when he speaks his whole face stretches weirdly like it's made of fleshy salt-water taffy.\" He's not pretty in the remaster, to be sure. He looks like a meth head, or maybe a guy named Dylan whose girlfriend dumped him because he spent the rent money on a guitar he can't play and he's been crying for three straight days. But he's not a nightmarish blob of mismatched features, which is a bit disappointing. No more jumpscare the first time you talk to Jorck? This did not bode well. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. But visiting another character I deemed ugly in my first tour, Logvaar of the Jerall View Inn, I found him much more faithful to the original, though less dorky and more unsettling. Perhaps it's because they swapped out his big brown eyes for beady blue ones so pale they're almost white. Fair trade: I don't like looking at either of them. Next stop: Newheim the Portly, who wasn't particularly portly in the original, and if anything is less portly now. But whereas he was harmlessly unpleasant to look at in the original, now he's more ominously unpleasant. Again, his eyes are just a little too weird to want to talk to him for long. I approve. As I made my way through the world closely examining faces, I discovered that even though the citizens look a lot different than they used to, they're often still plenty weird. Mouths, overall, seem too big and cavernous. Faces are occasionally weirdly lumpy. They're a far cry from the original Oblivion, but I like these strange mugs for different reasons. Here's a gallery of some of my favorite new beautiful uggos. It takes some getting used to, but I think this is the best outcome I could have asked for. I didn't want them to be hot or bland, and they're not. The remastered faces are still charmingly ugly, but in a fun and different way. Enough of that and onto the real business. Fans ofmy original article(there are probably no fans of my original article) are all now wondering the same thing: Chris, did you get bored of your photography assignment and eventually become fixated on Imperial City musician Salomon Geonette again? Did you follow him around, rifle through his belongings, stare at him while he slept, and then stand outside his door for 13 straight days so you could follow him on his monthly journey to Bruma during which you impassively watched him get slaughtered by a wolf? Ha ha, no, of course not. I only had to stand outside his door for 8 days this time before I could follow him to Bruma. It was a nice, slow walk, the kind you should really take in Oblivion once in a while, especially since the remastered world is much prettier now. And our trip was spiced up by the moment where, after ignoring me for a couple of hours, Geonette suddenly whirled around and approached me, fists up. Turns out he was engaging an imp I hadn't noticed. Geonette, weaponless, punched the imp to death with just three blows, adding \"You're pathetic!\" before continuing his journey. Damn, Salomon! Looks like the real remaster is that you're no longer a useless goof, you can throw hands like a champ. Sadly, he let his victory over a tiny winged demon go to his head, and when he tried the same moves with a heavily armed marauder outside Sercen, he got slashed, he ran away, he got caught, and he got killed. I guess some things never change. 20 years later, Oblivion's citizens are still a bunch of weird-looking folk, and Salomon Geonette still can't make it to Bruma without ending up dead next to the road. Oblivion remastered changes: What's new and what's not?Oblivion console commands: Cheats new and oldOblivion lockpicks: Where and how to use themOblivion vampirism cure: Rid yourself of the afflictionOblivion thieves guild: How to join the crew Chris started playing PC games in the 1980s, started writing about them in the early 2000s, and (finally) started getting paid to write about them in the late 2000s.

    "title": "How to unlock Alice in Disney Dreamlight Valley",
    "article_text": "Here's what you need to do to invite Alice to live in your valley. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. When you've unlocked the door to the Wonderland realm with 15,000 Dreamlight, you'll be able to begin your quest to unlock Alice in Dreamlight Valley. But getting into the Wonderland realm isn't as straightforward as unlocking the door in the Dream Castle and walking in like other realms. There's a little more Wonderland magic in this quest. Once you've gotten rid of the Night Thorns, the door will shrink down and a white rabbit will run out. Merlin will say you should go after it, and you'll need to chase it around the valley before falling into a rabbit hole and finding yourself in Wonderland. You'll meet Alice as soon as you're in, but you'll have to complete her quests before you can invite her to your valley. As soon as you meet Alice and speak to her, she will tell you tofollow her to the Queen of Hearts' garden. But this mission is turned on its head pretty quickly as Alice disappears into the forest and you need totrack her footprints on the floor to get to the Cheshire Cat's tree. He will offer to help you find Alice, but you need to find three Cheshire Cat faces around the realm before he will. Fortunately, these faces aren't too hard to find. I found the first smile after turning right from the area with the Cheshire Cat in and thefirst face was on a bush. From here, I went right again and then turned left and found thesecond smile on a red tree. Thethird smile was on a rockstraight ahead from this area. Go back to the Cheshire Cat when you've collected all three and he will tell you to gather the following ingredients from chests: However, chests don't look like chests in Wonderland. Instead, you need togo into each area of the forest and find the bright pink itemssuch as rocks, logs, or bushes and interact with them to turn them back into normal chests so you can get the ingredients out. Since each area is home to one, if not two chests, you shouldn't struggle to find these ingredients quickly. When you've gathered them all, go back to the Cheshire Cat and you will have tocook a Spicy Moment and a Sweet Moment, alongside \"more time.\" There's a cooking station at the start of the realm so you don't need to travel back to the Valley. Cheshire also gives you the recipes for each. Here's how to make a Spicy Moment: Here's how to make a Sweet Moment: When you've made both of these, you'll need to bake \"More Time\": You now have to find your way around the forest to wherever Alice went. If youhead straight on from the entrance of the realm, and then go right when you hit a dead end, you'll find the Mushroom Forest and the portal in the tree. Go through this, and you'll enter the Queen of Hearts' garden. Before you can get to Alice you need to pull four levers around the Queen of Hearts' labyrinth. These naturally pop up on the path as you walk around, so as long as you're avoiding the card guards you can't get this wrong. When you've reached the exit of the labyrinth, you'll be reunited with Alice. But she's shrunk since the last time you saw her. This will end the Wonders of Wonderland quest and begin the next. When you talk to Alice, she'll ask you to go back to the Cheshire Cat in the forest to ask for help. He will tell you that youneed to find four ingredientsto craft a bottle of \"Contrary Perfume\" which will restore Alice to her normal size. The first, and the easiest to find, is a Jar of Heart Candies which you can fish from the pond to the right-hand side of the realm entrance. Once you've got this, you'll need to talk to the \"matriarch of the singing flowers\" in the area directly ahead of you. To solve this problem,water the smaller flowers either side of the larger oneand you'll receive two bags of \"discontinued seeds.\" For the next item,head to the big blue mushroom at the beginning of the realm and a smaller blue mushroom will be available to pick up on the floor next to it. From here, go into the first area and you'll see abird with a pencil for a headsitting on top of a stack of books. Interact with it, and you will be challenged to answer five questions correctly in return for the Wonderland Plaque. The answers to the bird's questions are: Take all of these ingredients to a crafting station and you'll be able to make a contrary perfume. Go back to Alice in the Queen of Hearts' garden and she will turn back to normal size. When you talk to her, she'll ask for your help in freeing some woodland creatures stuck in crates in the garden, but the boxes are locked and the keys are hidden somewhere on the table. Unsurprisingly you won't be able to get to them straight away. Instead, you'll need to find a few items around this area to help make navigating the table easier. You'll need to find lovely dice, lost marbles, and a pack of playing cards: Pick these up, interact with the table and you'll shrink yourself down. The four keys are easy to find here, but some are tucked in other objects you need to break down first. The first is in apot of sugar which you need to dissolve with your watering can. For the key hidden in the cupcake frosting,use your shovel to dig it out. The key in the teacup needs to be fished out once you'veused your pickaxe to break the teapot behind itand flood the cup. The fourth is just lying on the floor. Take these back to Alice and free the animals. This will end the Teeny Tiny Problems quest. The animals made a mess after you'd freed them and Alice insists you help her clean up before she goes back to the valley. You have to paint the white roses red, clear up any smashed plates, and sort out the burrow holes before you can talk to Alice again.All the smashed plates are around the tea party table. The burrow holes in the centre of this areaneed to be dug up. As for the red roses, Alice will give you a bucket of red paint which you need to combine with your watering can in your inventory. When you've done this, you can walk up to the white rose bushes andwater them to turn them red. Once this is done speak to Alice again and she will ask you to meet her at the entrance to the realm. Meet here there and you'll both go to speak to the Cheshire Cat in an attempt to get some help leaving. Four clusters of colorful mushrooms will now be by the entrance of the realm, and as Cheshire Cat vaguely explains you'll need to light the correct ones to spawn the door out of the realm.You only need to light the pink and blue mushroomsto make the door appear. But wait; the door is tiny. Alice will give you the Contrary Perfume to once again mix with your watering can. Water the door and it will grow and you'll both be able to leave.When you're back in the valley you'll be able toplace Alice's house. It will cost 5,000 Star Coins to build, but as soon as you have the \"Welcome Alice\" screen will play and you'll finally have her in your Valley.

    "title": "Steam's gonna start listing 'adjustable difficulty,' 'save anytime,' and other accessibility features right on a game's store page soon",
    "article_text": "Because people should probably know if they can play a game before they buy it. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It feels like videogames are getting better at realising that, you know, a whole load of different people play videogames these days. Pretty much any modern release will run you through a set of accessibility options the first time you launch it, and those options usually seem pretty expansive, at least to me. But I don't need them, so I could be overlooking some obvious missing options—the writers at websites likeCan I Play That?look for everything from difficulty options to adjustable text size to sound navigation to determine how accessible games are. The problem, of course, is that if you need a particular accessibility option in one of the thousands of games on Steam that hasn't gotten a detailed accessibility review, there's often no way to find out what's in store other than buying it. But it looks like Steam's on its way to rectifying that. In a recentSteamworks update(viaGamingOnLinux) Valve announced a \"new accessibility-support questionnaire for developers to better describe the way their games support accessibility.\" In essence, anyone publishing a game on Steam now has access to a questionnaire where they tick boxes for the accessibility features their games have. Got adjustable text size? Tick a box. Got narrated menus? Tick a box. Colourblind options? Tick a box. And so on. You can find a full list of accessibility options devs will be able to choose from below. That questionnaire is live now, but Valve is giving devs a few months to get to grips with it before the next phase: surfacing the selected features on games' store pages. \"Later this year,\" Steam will start showing players what accessibility features a game (says it) has in the same section it shows stuff like controller support and Steam achievements. Players will also be able to use accessibility features as search parameters on the store. It's a positive sign, I think, that the de facto PC videogame store deems accessibility features important enough to put smack-dab on the store page like this, but Valve says devs and publishers won't beforcedto use the system. You can refuse to tell Steam anything about the accessibility and still be listed on the store, but it's \"highly recommended\" they do. I hope that's impetus enough, but part of me wonders if it wouldn't be better to set a deadline after which all new games on the platform have to list out accessibility options. I suppose we'll find out if Steam sellers use the questionnaire of their own accord once it starts to roll out to buyers.

    "title": "The creators of Wingspan are 'suing the president' to try and save board game publishers from tariff annihilation",
    "article_text": "Stonemaier Games are taking part in a group lawsuit with an unspecified number of other board game publishers. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A couple of weeks ago, I wrote abouthow devastating an impact a 54% tariff on imports from China to the US would be on the particularly vulnerable tabletop gaming industry. Things were already looking pretty apocalyptic at that stage—but, of course, my article was already outdated within days, as the tariffs surged even higher. They currently stand at 145%, changing the outlook for the future from 'selling board games will be extremely difficult' to 'selling board games will be nearly impossible'. So much so that Stonemaier Games, publisher of smash hit board game Wingspan, is taking the fairly dramatic step of\"suing the president\"to try and change the course of the tariffs. The announcement doesn't go into the specifics of the legal action being taken, but it's a group lawsuit of some kind—and it sounds like a big group. Stonemaier initially invited other publishers to get in touch with them to join the suit, but has since updated the post to say that \"the law firm has informed me that they now have as many clients as the case can handle\", though it continues togather statements via an online formto further support the case. The crux of Stonemaier's argument is that it and other board game publishers ordered print runs of games to be manufactured in China before the tariffs came into effect, and now face unreasonable costs to import the finished products that they couldn't have planned for ahead of time. It's currently facing \"nearly $1.5 million\" in such fees. It's a problem that will be particularly stark for many Kickstarter projects, which may now be unable to complete as the cost of importing the goods grows beyond the money already pledged by backers. How much good such a lawsuit can materially do is up in the air, however. Even in the best case scenario it's hard not to imagine such a case taking years to bear any fruit in the courts—though perhaps if it brings together enough companies, it may serve its purpose just as a clear act of protest against the government's actions. Meanwhile, the creators of Gloomhavenhave announced that its second edition is on holddue to the tariffs, and the company's future uncertain; Van Ryder Games has announcedimmediate price increases on its popular Final Girl series; and many other publishers continue to post deeply concerned and uncertain updates and blogs, reflecting on a future that seems guaranteed to simply gut the tabletop games industry if the situation does not change. At leastrecent comments from Trump himselfhave offered a sliver of hope—he's said to reporters that he plans to be \"very nice\" to China and that tariffs with \"drop substantially—but it won't be zero\". As ever though we have no timetable for that or clarity on what the final situation is likely to be, and the industry will certainly be hoping for a decrease of over 100% to be able to move forward with any confidence.

    "title": "Framework 13 AMD AI 300-series review",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I am a huge fan of the Framework 13 machines, and love the upgrade/repair ethos of the company. This AMD AI 300 series mainboard delivers the best overall experience, making it the ultimate version, but the price premium does kinda make the older Ryzen 7 7840U board still very tempting. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. This is the best Framework 13 laptop the company has ever produced. The mighty newAMD RyzenAI 9 HX 370 mainboard is obviously the main thing which has improved the overall experience, performance, and battery life of the wee upgradeable wonder, but I am also rather into the new keyboard and GameBoy Advance opaque monitor bezel, too. I've long loved the ethos behind the Framework 13. It's the ship of Theseus in laptop form. That's how we often refer to our desktop machines, where we'll rip out and replace the innards however we wish, but that's rarely been a feature of notebooks. And where it has been in the past, it's not been for long. Framework, however, has proved itself, releasing new mainboards across a host of different Intel and AMD (and even RISC) PCBs you can quickly and easily drop into the same 13-inch chassis you might have bought four years ago. And each and every other part of these remarkable laptops can be upgraded, too, and in that time we've had new input modules, higher resolution panels, and now a new keyboard and trackpad module, too. And everything is compatible with the very first Framework 13. It's an idea that really captures my imagination, and means that, despite the higher cost of a Framework laptop, the idea that it can grow with me over time and I won't need to spend that much again to get an improved device in a few years time makes the machines incredibly desirable. If you can afford it. Mainboard:AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370Cores:12Threads:24Boost clock:5.1 GHziGPU:Radeon 890MCompute units:16Memory:64 GB DDR5-5600Storage:1 TB WD Black SN850XScreen:13-inch matteResolution:2880 x 1920Refresh rate:120 HzBattery:61 WhrDimensions:16 mm x 297 mm x 229 mmPrice:$2,094|£2,108 But all is notentirelyrosy in my Framework laptop garden. I've spent a long time using these machines now, often as my daily driver work notebook and travel companion, and in that time there are things I wish the company would get around to sorting out. It's certainly not the hardware—though I'd love a less ghostly screen—it's the software. Or rather, the complete lack thereof. Sure, we often castigate laptop makers for their bloatware and myriad apps for controlling fans and lighting and power profiles and updates and whatever else a company wants to force on us. But a simple Framework app that gives us control over fan curves and power would be the icing on the endlessly repairable cake. Noise has been an issue with Framework 13 machines in the past and, though it's been noticeably improved with the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 mainboard here, it will still get those fans blowing even just doing a Windows update. I'd love to have the option to adjust those fan curves to be a little easier on the ear, especially when I'm using my laptop in polite company. Read: don't want my partner kicking off because I'm playing Football Manager while Below Deck is dominating the projector screen. It would also be neat to have that tied into a more granular level of control over the APU, in the same way we can with gaming handhelds using the exact same processor silicon. That's how we get better battery life and noise levels on those devices, so we know it's possible with a little software work. But still, the gaming battery life of the AI 9 HX 370 is already pretty damned good even when that Radeon 890M iGPU is being thrashed, and it will also deliver impressive frame rates, too. When it comes to gaming, this is the most powerful and performant Framework laptop I've seen outside of the sadly stuntedFramework 16. Given AMD's current mobile graphics strategy, the likelihood of seeing a GPU update for that 16-inch gaming laptop is pretty low right now. Stick to 1080p and, with a little FSR frosting and maybe some frame gen thrown in here and there, you'll see some stellar gaming performance out of this 13-incher. The only actual let down on that front is the screen itself. Now, I'm happy that Framework has started shipping this higher-resolution, 120 Hz display for its machines, but one of the biggest downside to the original 2256 x 1504 screen was its response time, and that hasn't been massively improved with the updated 2880 x 1920 panel. That means you do get a level of ghosting that doesn't feel great when you're gaming on the device. Though, obviously it bears saying that this is not a gaming laptop, it's just far more capable of it than previous boards have allowed. I've gone for the GameBoy Advance purple, and it really does frame the Framework beautifully. But there are fresh upgrades alongside the new AMD mainboard, too. And the most obvious from a visual standpoint are the see-through bezels and IO modules. I've got grey and purple options for this machine, and of course I've gone for the GameBoy Advance purple, and it really does frame the Framework beautifully. The other addition is more subtle, and that's the new input cover kit. For the uninitiated, that's the cover which includes both keyboard and trackpad. This second gen cover is designed to have better key stability and more consistent illumination. And while the white RGB LEDs still look fine—and the font is slightly different—the thing is a pleasure to type on, even though I erroneously had a German QWERTZ board shipped my way. Thankfully muscle memory really does help… It is worth cycling back around to the cost angle, however, because Framework laptops are not cheap. It doesn't have the manufacturing might of the Dells and Lenovos of the world, and it's doing something sadly unique, which means there is a price premium. This DIY build I've been testing comes with the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 board, 64 GB DDR5-5600, and a 1 TB WD SN850X SSD. And that makes this an expensive purchase at$2,094(£2,108). I'm into the repair and upgradeability ethos, and that will make it a more affordable laptop years down the line, but when something like the Samsung Galaxy Book4 Edge, with its Snapdragon X Elite chip and OLED screen is just over a grand, orhalf the price, it's only the potential future e-waste that would genuinely give me pause. ✅You value the idea of endless repairability and upgradeability:The whole deal with the Framework 13 is that it can grow with you and you can upgrade as you need... and never need buy another laptop again.✅You want a little laptop with actual gaming potential:The Radeon 890M iGPU has a lot of gaming grunt despite its diminutive scale. ❌You just need a cheap laptop for right now:I get it, sometimes you do just need to buy the notebook you can afford, and the Framework ethos does come with a price premium.❌You must have a quality screen:This is still the weakest part of the Framework package; there's no OLED here. I've been using a Qualcomm machine for almost a year now as my actual go-to work laptop. It's not let me down yet, and will play Football Manager pretty much silently, with the same battery life. You can go cheaper, of course. There's the Ryzen AI 7 350 board, with eight CUs and kinda Steam Deck levels of gaming perf, and you can pair that with 16 GB DDR5 and a cheaper 1 TB drive to bring it down to a more manageable $1,500. That would be a fine machine, but at that point I'd stick with the olderAMD Ryzen 7 7840U Framework 13 mainboardwith the better graphics and even lower sticker price. The beauty of theFramework marketplaceis that older boards do get discounted while they're still in stock. Then there's also the fact you could just buy the mainboard on its own if you're already in the Framework ecosystem, or bring in an SSD from another build, or you want to source SODIMMs yourself. All ways to make things cheaper for yourself in the same way you might while building out a DIY desktop PC. But still, this pricing stuff is where it gets complicated because if you're starting out with Framework there is a price premium. It's morals vs. your bank account. The planet vs. what you can actually afford today. I love the Framework 13, and with the HX 370 APU it's a fantastic all-round device—and the best it's ever been—but it's also a very expensive one that means you really are paying for that possible future upgrade. If you can afford it, though, it should absolutely be an ethos to get behind. I am a huge fan of the Framework 13 machines, and love the upgrade/repair ethos of the company. This AMD AI 300 series mainboard delivers the best overall experience, making it the ultimate version, but the price premium does kinda make the older Ryzen 7 7840U board still very tempting.

    "title": "Swen Vincke and Larian celebrate the last major content update for Baldur's Gate 3, and say now they'll 'focus on making our next big thing as good as we can'",
    "article_text": "\"Feeling good today about where we are with BG3.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Baldur's Gate 3 recently received itseighth major patchand, pinky promise, this time Larian Studios says it's done. All those other times it said it was done were just plain fooling: it's really, properly done with the game now. Wipe that manly tear from your eye, friend, for at the very leastPatch 8 is a cornucopia of goodness, with Larian's bounty as boundless as the sea: studio boss Swen Vincke noted that there were \"48 pages\" of patch notes and \"if there were a Michelin guide to patches, I’d give this one 3 stars.\" We'll be doing the reviewing round here Vincke. Though, erm, Baldur's Gate 3 does happen to be PC Gamer'shighest-rated game of all time(and sits proudly at the summit ofour Top 100), with Patch 8's slew of final additions just the cherry on an enormously tasty cake and, appropriately enough, the capstone to eight years of work on the game (Wizards of the Coast approached Larian about making the game in 2017). While Larian will obviously continue to issue bug fixes and maintenance where necessary, this really is the end of active development. And the team is understandably now looking back on what it achieved with pride, and a determination to focus on the next thing. \"Feeling good today about where we are with BG3,\"writes Vincke. \"Patch 8 got a lot of people playing again. It took a lot of development effort but I'm happy we did it.\" Vincke here shares a Steam concurrent players chart showing that, in the immediate aftermath of Patch 8's release, many thousands of players returned to the game. \"With mod support thriving,\" concludes Vincke, \"I think the game will now continue to do well for quite some time. It gives us room to focus on making our next big thing as good as we can and that focus is more than welcome. We've got big shoes to fill.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. That last line has inevitably been interpreted by some as a tease: whose shoes, exactly? Is Larian going to revitalise another classic IP like, for example, Planescape Torment? That's probably (definitely) reading too much into it, because Vincke could simply be talking about the studio following up on its own colossal success, but stick your answers on a postcard (unless you work at Larian, in which case call me, babe). Vincke's personal message was accompanied by a message from the official Larian Studios account. \"You helped us make Baldur's Gate 3 a bigger success than we could’ve ever hoped for, and that passion could keep us tweaking things and making changes until the end of time,\"reads the studio statement. \"But then we’d never be able to create something new. Thank you, from all of us at Larian Studios.\" The message ends with a little heart emoji, which is rather sweet from the studio that brought us rampant bear sex and possibly the horniest RPG of all time. But the message is clear: this really is it for Baldur's Gate 3 in terms of (official) new content. Which is bittersweet, not so much for Larian moving on, because whatever it makes next is bound to be great, but because it leaves Baldur's Gate and D&D generally in the fumbling hands of Wizards of the Coast, which has proven itself incredibly adept atsquandering all the good willgames such as this create. Let's not end on a bum note, however. Baldur's Gate 3 is one of the greatest journeys gaming will ever offer in our lifetimes, one that it's been a privilege to share as players, and one that we'll always be able to return to, again and again. This game is a beauty and, as Swen and his merry band sally forth to pastures new, all one can do is throw a salute, wish them luck, and say thanks for the memories. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Rich is a games journalist with 15 years' experience, beginning his career on Edge magazine before working for a wide range of outlets, including Ars Technica, Eurogamer, GamesRadar+, Gamespot, the Guardian, IGN, the New Statesman, Polygon, and Vice.

    "article_text": "Not throwing in the towel. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Where has the year gone? Seems like just yesterday the hardware team was all hands on deck for a fresh wave of Nvidia graphics cards that was not exactly the smoothest of sailing. Now we're already staring down this year's Computex, set to run between May 20 and 23 in Taipei, Taiwan, potentially setting the stage for a great big graphics card clash. Appearing alongside the usual suspects, such asNvidia CEO Jensen Huang giving a keynotejust before the main event on May 19, AMD refuses to be overshadowed.AMD announced its own Computex press conferencefor May 21, at 11 am UTC+8 as both an in-person and streamed event. Details about what will be discussed are expectedly thin. What we know so far is that Computing and Graphics Group Jack Huynh, plus guests, will take to the stage to discuss \"how AMD is expanding its leadership across gaming, workstations, and AI PCs.\" As vague as that is, it could be a pretty exciting stageside chat as a little sleuthing from our Jacob suggests we'll also hear more aboutAMD's affordable RX 9060 cards. Last we heard, the RX 9060 cards would arrive some time between April and June. With the slightly delayed launch of AMD'sRX 9070andRX 9070 XTcards, it makes sense that perhaps AMD's plans for the RX 9060 cards have also been pushed back. That means a more detailed announcement in May would still vaguely line up ahead of a potential, properly-summer release. As a perpetually chilly Brit, that would mean I have to survive England's seemingly never-ending false-spring long enough to get into actual-spring, but let's set aside my temperature-based trials and tribulations. Besides unveiling a few more affordable graphics card options for the cost conscious, AMD could also turn heads with a deeper dive into itsRyzen Z2 APUpitched for future handheld gaming PCs. At any rate, it's definitely not unexpected that AMD would mention gaming and AI in the same breath—for one,Nvidia made bank on AIin its last financial year, and for another, the company'sDLSS 4deployment hasmade a Nvidia turncoat of our Andy. Perhaps AMD is looking to regain some ground in the not-too-distant future. How will they do that, exactly?

    "article_text": "So that's why they call it a remaster. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If you're anything like me, the first time you laid eyes on Oblivion Remastered, you wondered why it was called Oblivion Remastered. 'Surely,' you mused to yourself in an urbane, handsome, charmingly mischievous sort of way, 'this is a full-onremake? This is far too much work to just call a remaster.' Well, it's because it really is a remaster—that 2006 game wrapped in a few lovely looking layers of Unreal Engine 5. If you delve into Oblivion Remastered's files, you'll eventually find pretty much all the files for the original game in the exact same structure they were in when they hit your hard drive in 2006. Head to[Drive Letter] > SteamLibrary > steamapps > common > Oblivion Remastered > OblivionRemastered > Content > Dev > ObvData > Dataand, if you ever spent any time shuffling mods around an original Oblivion install, it'll be like seeing an old friend. It's nearly all there. Some stuff has been yanked out—there's no original Oblivion .exe in the root directory any more, nor the stuff for the original launcher—but those .ini files you spent hours tweaking? Right where you left them. The music, texture, and shaders folders? Still there. The original game's .esm, .esp, and .bsa files? Unmoved. I downloaded the original Oblivion to compare, and many of them are the exact same size as they were in 2006. I even swapped the Oblivion.esm master file between the original game and the remaster, and both of them ran fine, like nothing had changed (because, well, it hadn't). Somethings have expanded or contracted in size. The .bsa archives for the game's voice lines, for instance, have gotten bigger (I'm guessing for the extra VO), and the Remastered directories have some extra entries for stuff like the Deluxe Edition content, but for the most part it's the Oblivion you loved 19 years ago. Here's a quick side-by-side of the two games' directories. I suspect to some of you who did more employable degrees than I did, this won't be much of a surprise, but I've found the experience oddly educational and a fun example of the technical wizardry Virtuos and Bethesda did to make the thing work.

    "article_text": "Strong but stretchy, apparently. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. When it comes to computing, flexibility usually means something to do with software compatibility, or just maybe abendable screen. But a computer chip that can be extended to over three times its normal size? That's a real, er, stretch. But it's exactly whata team of researchers at MITare claiming their new \"strong but stretchy\" metamaterial could enable. A metamaterial, in case you're wondering, is a substance with multiple microscopic structures. Typically, these structures combine to enable properties that are usually compatible, including strength combined with softness or stretchiness. As for the new MIT material, it combines a \"rigid, grid-like scaffold of struts and trusses\" with \"a pattern of coils that weave around each strut and truss\". Both structures are made from the same acrylic plastic and are printed in simultaneously using a high-precision, laser-based printing technique called two-photon lithography. “Think of this woven network as a mess of spaghetti tangled around a lattice. As we break the monolithic lattice network, those broken parts come along for the ride, and now all this spaghetti gets entangled with the lattice pieces,” MIT professor Carlos Portela explains. “That promotes more entanglement between woven fibers, which means you have more friction and more energy dissipation.” MIT attached either end of the new material to a specialized nanomechanical press and measured the force it took to pull it apart. The result? The new double-network design could be stretched to three times its own length. MIT also says some printed patterns, \"can impart exceptional strength and impact resistance to the resulting metamaterial.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. This clever new material has a myriad of possible applications using several different base substances. MIT claims it could be used to fabricate stretchy ceramics, glass, and metals. Specific applications include tear-resistant textiles or durable yet compliant scaffolds on which to grow cells for tissue repair. Oh and flexible semiconductors and chip packaging. While that immediately brings to mind various sci-fi possibilities when it comes to bendable or stretchable devices, MIT's new metamaterial could also make existing device classes more robust and reliable. Portable devices like laptops and tablets are particularly prone to physical stresses. But motherboards and graphics cards can also bend over time, often as a result of heat cycles. If not only the chips and other components built onto those boards, but also the electrical traces, were actually bendable themselves, it's not hard to imagine almost unbreakable digital devices. Indeed, \"ceramics, glass and metals\" covers off pretty much everything that goes into computers and other gadgets that isn't already flexible, opening up a whole world of possibilities that go well beyond mere folding or flexible screens.

Monster Hunter Wildskicked off April withTitle Update 1, adding new monster hunts, challenge quests, and a new Grand Hub as a central base of operations and socializing space for hunters to hang out between quests. It's also the venue for Blossomdance, the first Monster Hunter Wilds seasonal event, which kicked off last night in a blizzard of cherry blossom petals and sakura-themed armor sets. When you first enter the Grand Hub during Blossomdance, you'll be greeted by a lot of pink. It's Monster Hunter's own hanami festival, covering the Hub with cherry blossoms and spring pastel streamers. The main attraction, however, are the event's sakura-themed armor sets. The Sakuratide armor sets are easily among the prettiest outfits in Wild, and I'm sure they'll be frequent features in layered armor getups for years to come. Do I feel like my weeb levels are getting a little unsustainable while wearing them? Yes.But look at them.It's good stuff. (And yes, you can tone the pink down by changing the armor pigment if you want.) To craft the Sakuratide sets, you'll need Blossomdance Tickets, which you'll get as login bonuses and limited bounty rewards during the event's two-week duration. One week's bounties will only get you enough tickets for one of the armor sets, but you're in luck: Wearing pieces of Sakuratide armor will give you the Blossomdance Boon skill, giving you a chance to earn additional Blossomdance Tickets whenever you complete a quest. Just throw on your new duds, run some hunts, and you'll have enough materials for both sets in no time. You can also use Blossomdance Tickets to craft a—frankly unsettling—papier mache bobblehead getup for your palico. There's also a new event quest to hunt a Tempered Xu Wu to earn yet another form of ticket that you can use to craft a cool new eyepatch. It's a big week for building out your Monster Hunter Wilds aesthetic options. And there are still more goodies on offer. After accepting your login bonus during the event, you'll automatically unlock a new Seikret decoration, a petal-tossing gesture, sakura-themed pop-up camp gear, and more. You can also talk to one of the Support Deck palico NPCs and select Claim Content to get a free weapon pendant. A veritable bounty of freebies. All those armor sets and cosmetics will only be available while the event lasts, so jump in-game and grab them if you want them. You've got until Blossomdance ends on May 7.

    "article_text": "\"We call it dynamic comic style.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Before playingMarvel Rivals, I was suffering from a serious case of MCU fatigue. I'd gone from watching every film on opening night to actively trying to avoid whatever slop they were trying to shove out as quickly as possible after Endgame. But it took all of two seconds after booting up Marvel Rivals to get excited about all the superheroes again, and its comic book art style was a big reason why. \"In the early stages of defining the overall project's style, our aim was to create a distinctive artistic style,\" the art director known as Dino says in aYouTube video. \"Therefore, we drew inspiration from various aspects such as animation, film, and graphic design. We infused our style with bold colours and rough brushstrokes, emphasising primary colours and the vitality of hues. We call it 'dynamic comic style.'\" Marvel Rivals tier list: Best characters for each roleMarvel Rivals characters: Current and confirmed rosterMarvel Rivals ranks: How to climb in competitiveMarvel Rivals codes: Grab free gear and moreMarvel Rivals crosshairs: The best custom reticles Colours like Fissure Black, Radiant White, and Energy Yellow, which the devs use more than anything else. \"They account for roughly 70% to 100% of the overall system design,\" according to TT, a UI visual designer. But you could probably infer that on your own by just looking at the homepage or anywhere in Marvel Rivals: there's a lot of yellow. While the colours are certainly vibrant, they're not the driving force behind Marvel Rivals' art style. In Marvel Rivals' trailers, launcher, home screen, shop, hero selection screen, and game, you'll see a combination of 2D and 3D styles. \"We use flat stylised lighting and chromatic aberration so the hero portraits burst to life,\" Dino says. \"It lets the heroes leap off the page, creating a compelling style unique to Marvel Rivals, with a strong and distinctive visual representation, which has always been our goal. \"The art style naturally suits heroic characters and storytelling with its vibrant colours embodying pop culture vibes and anime, comic, and game characteristics.\" I love the art style of all the heroes in Marvel Rivals, and all the costumes that have been subsequently added go a long way to making each character even better. The style also makes it seem like you're playing heroes that have jumped straight out of a comic, which I especially love. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"Focusing on the dynamics of camera distance and swift cuts to enhance motion and action,\" Dino continues. \"We utilised a comic-esque 'performance feel' to embody heroic qualities. Along with techniques like line trembling, dynamic cuts, and colour block blurring to intensify visual impact. Players find themselves immersed in an epic storyline!\" It would have been impressive if the devs had nailed playing as just one Marvel superhero, but ensuring that every single hero, out of a roster of 36, manages to resemble their comic book inspirations and play exactly as I'd always envisioned is amazing. \"While creating storyboards for a superhero IP project, one of the most challenging aspects is capturing the unique performance style of each character on camera,\" character designer Hehuiz says. \"Marvel heroes are iconic to fans, each possessing signature movements and personality traits. Their rich histories and stories often predate our own lives. During the storyboarding phase, we have to emphasise these traits, highlighting the heroic qualities to ensure this essence carries on to the next phase.\" Elie is a news writer with an unhealthy love of horror games—even though their greatest fear is being chased.

    "article_text": "Must... not... praise... the... AI... When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Nvidia G-Assist is one of the few AI tools we in the PC Gamer hardware lair have genuinely liked the look of. G-Assist promises quite a lot, but at bottom it's a local language model you can run off your RTX 30-series (or above) GPU to help you with gaming-related tasks. Now, however, it looks like the number of tasks it'll be able to perform could be about to explode, as it's opening up to community plugin development. Nvidia explains: \"This week’sAI Garage blogfocuses on how Project G-Assist is receiving even more support for tinkering, allowing for lightweight custom plug-ins to improve the PC experience.\" And further: \"Plug-ins are lightweight add-ons that give software new capabilities. G-Assist plug-ins can control music, connect with large language models and much more.\" Setting aside the questionable use of a dash in the middle of the perfectly respectable word \"plugin\", this all sounds like very good news for an AI tool that we already liked the look of. Initially it was the ability to have AIhelp you optimise your game settingsthat tickled our fancy, but upon its launch last month our Jameslamented the absence of its gaming AIthat can help you make in-game decisions and so on, much likeRazer Ava. Throw community-made plugs into the mix and by Jove we might just have an actually impressive and beneficial local AI on our hands. Part of the allure of G-Assist is that it runs in the Nvidia overlay, so no alt-tabbing is necessary. Plus the fact that it's local and can hook in certain data from your system such as, most obviously, info about the game you're playing and its settings. Now, the range of fiddling you'll be able to do via this screen is going to shoot up, as Nvidia says that \"Project G-Assist is built for community expansion.\" Plugin developers will be able to \"define functions in JSON and drop config files into a designated directory, where G-Assist can automatically load and interpret them. Users can even submit plug-ins for review and potential inclusion in the NVIDIA GitHub repository to make new capabilities available for others.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. It looks like this will be able to be achieved with the help of a ChatGPT-based Plugin Builder (yes, that's an AI helping you make plugins for another AI). Instructions are found in theGitHub repo. For the average gamer, there arealready some sample pluginswhich you can drop into your G-Assist folder and use from the get-go. These plugins are \"for controlling peripheral & smart home lighting, invoking larger AI models like Gemini, managing Spotify tracks, or even checking streamers' online status on Twitch.\" The prospect of having lightweight, local plugins of your choice to run off your Nvidia GPU—rather than trying to, say, cram an entire gigantic LLM onto your local drive—is very appealing, especially when it can be accessed in-game with an overlay. I, for one, am excited to see what plugins people come up with… you know, so I don't have to do any actual coding myself, with or without the help of an AI.

    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's gorgeously realized world is let down by its emphasis on combat, marred by a few fatal stumbles. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. You know how comedy geniuses and chronic dieters will say their favorite brand of chips is \"dangerous,\" because once you rip open the bag it’s a swift trip to the bottom? That’s me with JRPGs; Kingdom Hearts’ absurd garble of a plot breached my treasured memories after I spent 100 hours with its cast, and the Wii’s Xenoblade Chronicles infected me with a deep-seated bitterness at the fact that I don’t live on a giant mech with a laser sword and a tax evading hamster. These games demand you live in them for a while, slowly fostering a bunch of level one nobodies into god-killing besties, and I'm susceptible enough to that demand I go into new JRPGs prepared to get lost in them, love them, and succumb to ennui when they’re finally over. Clair Obscur’s offbeat take on Belle Époque France promised blockbuster action, a cast of brooding sorcerers to mold into an apocalypse prevention squad, and a battle system which cleaves to genre standards while infusing them with twitchy QTEs and a dang gun I can fire in real time.Dangerous. Clair Obscur's commitment to the vibe drew me in at first, but ... mandatory distractions left me wondering if it might be more fun to gawk at than play Even more tantalizing was its premise, which is so convoluted it's hard to explain concisely. Every year a mysterious figure called the Paintress marks a giant tower with an increasingly low number, and everyone who's that age dies. Fantasy France has been sending expeditions to her tower to figure out what's going on beneath the shadow of a magically warped Eiffel Tower, but none of them have returned. The latest of these squads, my squad, are mostly 33, and in the apparent final year of their lives. Clair Obscur is superlatively French and I've never played an RPG quite like it. It's a somber, swashbuckling tale of loss with lots of surprises along the way, and the strong performances throughout bolster a plot which thrives on its novelty—though too slight and short to amount to much more. Clair Obscur oozes flair, and voice acting by the likes of Andy Serkis and Jennifer English (Baldur's Gate 3's Shadowheart) adds a lot of punch to its lengthy cinematics. Though its splashy combat UI isn't quite as extravagant as Persona's or Metaphor: Refantazio's, it's clearly cribbing from the best. Rapid QTEs and glowing swords dance in tandem with flashy particle effects and emphatic slow motion, giving otherwise ho-hum hacks and slashes the drama of a flying trapeze routine. When protagonist and sword-mage Gustave fires off a fully charged volley of red lightning and quips\"For those who come after\"as a reward for perfect QTE timing, it feels like the final act of a play I wrote just by killing a random goblin. It's rare a turn-based game rolls out the red carpet so lavishly, reaching for narrative catharsis while I grind hordes of identical ghoulies into EXP. Clair Obscur's commitment to the vibe drew me in at first, but it quickly piled on real-time parries, dodges, counters, and other mandatory distractions that left me wondering if it might be more fun to gawk at than play. I admit I've started to doze off grinding mobs in Dragon Quest before, and spicing up a turn-based battle system with a pinch of real-time challenge theoretically primed me to lock in a bit more. I think that's what Clair Obscur is going for when it takes a pretty familiar loop—queue up spells and attacks, guzzle potions to manage health and mana, make it to the next checkpoint without dying—and adds a lethal ultimatum: dodge or parry the majority of enemy attacks or get melted in a handful of turns. It certainly adds some tension, but so would balancing a beach ball on my nose while I speed down the highway. In practice, every overworld encounter becomes an uphill climb where pattern memorization is the crux of the action. These attacks are tricky to dodge; some make use of gratuitous slow motion while others don't. The game slowly introduces new types which must be jumped over, and more still which must be countered with a different button. It feels like Clair Obscur is deliberately trying to trip you up sometimes, and when some of its boss fights drag into multiple phases over dozens of minutes—often introducing new attacks right at the end—losing party members to a handful of failed dodges and getting sent back to the start is a drag. One common overworld enemy is the ghost of a deep sea diver lugging around a naval mine. There's some immediate counterplay I can leverage: if I spend some mana on a Free Aim shot at his mine, it'll do massive damage to the whole pack of enemies, and previous encounters have taught me his elemental resistances. But his signature attack calls down a delayed lightning strike with a narrow dodge window. If I perfectly parry, I'll get a sliver of mana, and if I fail, I almost instantly die. Nearly every fight I wasn't overleveled for cranked up the stakes to noxious thresholds this way—nail the dodge timing for the chance to proceed as normal or it's back to the last checkpoint. Git gud, right? I'd accept that reproach for a lot of games, but the trial-and-error rote memorization needed to reach credits in Clair Obscur frustrated me not just because it was constantly demanding, but because it drowned out the fantastic turn-based core. Character playstyles are radically different from one another; Monoco plays a bit like Final Fantasy's blue mage, collecting enemy attacks and empowering them at the whim of a constantly spinning wheel, while Maelle is a stance-dancing fencer who struggles to stay in a fleeting Virtuoso stance that triples her damage. I grew attached to the cast and struggled to choose my party of three because I found each character so fun. But as much as I tried to line up different status effect combos and outfit my team with different passives to complement their strengths, Clair Obscur never gave me much feedback. It's easy enough to get your party dishing out 9,999 damage regularly—the cap for most of the game—and while I struggled on nearly every boss fight, I never overcame them by adjusting my strategy. I always won because I memorized their animations and parried at the right moment every time. The real-time half and the turn-based half feel at odds, even if there are ways they serve each other. I admit it's fun to discover a secret weak point with the Free Aim shot or parry a flurry of attacks, flooding my mana pool with more than I could possibly spend in a turn. But because the game punishes a missed dodge so harshly and all I got for tightening my strategy was slightly shorter fights, it felt optimal to walk into any given battle with the intent to lose, memorize the enemy's attacks, and return to slap them around. Clair Obscur ultimately seemed uninterested in my build altogether, sometimes feeling more like a rhythm game with a JRPG awkwardly stapled onto it. Clair Obscur bills itself as an evolution of the JRPG, but beyond its surreal world and changes to combat, it's mostly business as usual, albeit streamlined. Exploration is split between a sprawling overworld map and smaller, self-contained zones, and enemies slowly patrol your path to the nearest objective waiting to be trounced. These encounters can be safely avoided for the most part, though you're likely to fall behind on levels if you avoid everything. That said, there's hardly a grind in this game, partially because there are no random encounters, and partially because it's astoundingly short for an RPG, clocking in at around 20 hours. I imagine whether that's a good or a bad thing depends on your work schedule and the size of your backlog, but I found it refreshingly fast-paced and lean. The streamlining continues in the world of inventory and party management; that is to say, there barely is any. Instead of buying or looting potions, you have a limited supply which replenishes each checkpoint. You accrue weapons which scale with different stats and passive-granting Pictos, each of which are easily swapped and reallocated between fights. It's all frictionless and slight, with the emphasis staying on the battles and cutscenes. Had the game been longer I might have wanted more, but the credits rolled before I could get antsy. That's what leaves me in a tough spot with Clair Obscur. The world and characters charmed me. The big goofy balloon man flying my party around not-France. The tragic and convoluted story of the Paintress. The capricious, shapeshifting vendors that only show their whole stock if you can beat them in a fight. It's all strange and arresting, really baguetting a double-take in a sea of games starring anime teenagers getting their deicide on. The score ping-pongs between swelling orchestras, roaring electric guitars, and '80s pop, and every environment I explored was radically different from the last. I feel like I should be chomping at the bit for another adventure in this world, but the majority of my time was spent wrestling with its battle system, undermined by real-time additions that feel like solutions in search of a problem. My affection for everyone in Expedition 33 was drowned out by the exhaustion I felt keeping them alive. Even as short as the game is, I sighed a breath of relief when it was finally over. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's gorgeously realized world is let down by its emphasis on combat, marred by a few fatal stumbles.

    "title": "How to complete the Oblivion Remastered deluxe edition quests",
    "article_text": "Speed through A Wound in Time and Burning Trail for that sweet, sweet deluxe edition content. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. So, you forked out for theOblivionRemastereddeluxe edition contentand are now left clueless about how to actually claim your in-game bonuses. Unlike most games, you're given no hints as to where you have to go to get your hands on it. After exploring Cyrodiil, I've figured out that these special items are actually rewards for completing new questlines:Burning TrailandA Wound in Time. You might expect exclusive deluxe edition quests to be added to your quest log automatically, as that's what most games would do, but that's not the case here. These quests are easy to miss, and you could go hours and hours before finding them, if indeed you find them at all. Below, I'll go over each of the questlines you need to complete to get your bonus items, including how to start and finish them, as even that's a tricky task. The Oblivion Remastered deluxe edition includes four new quests for exclusive Akatosh and Mehrunes Dagon armour sets, weapons, and horse armour: You can start these quests as soon as you leave the Imperial City Sewers, where the story begins. In fact, I recommend completing these new quests early on so that you can get some swanky weapons and armour to use while you go about saving Cyrodiil. To get the Akatosh gear, you'll need to complete the A Wound in Time quest and its sequel, Saving Time Itself. To start A Wound in Time,speak to Ilav Dralgoner, a priest outside the Kvatch refugee camp on the road leading to the city. This questline is much more linear and map-marker-laden than its Mehrunes Dagon counterpart, but here's a step-by-step guide to complete it: With both quests completed, you might be wondering where your loot is. To actually get the reward,you need to speak to Ilav again and say \"equipment\". This lets you pick individual gear pieces or claim all of them in each category (you can repeat the dialogue for each category to geteveryitem). From experience, you won't have enough carrying capacity for everything, so just pick the items you want to use for now. You can always return to Ilav to get more gear. These are all the items you can get: You'll need to complete the Burning Trail quest and its follow-up The Crimson Cave to claim the Mehrunes Dagon-themed gear. To start Burning Trail,collect the Mythic Dawn pamphlet on the barrel to the left of the dragon statue in the Talos Plaza Districtof the Imperial City. I recommend travelling to the Chestnut Handy Stables and then heading through the large doors into the Imperial City, as you'll come out in the Talos Plaza District. From here, it's as simple as walking up the stairs and taking the note from the barrel next to the blue post. The Burning Trail quest is much more complicated than the other deluxe edition content, so I'll break down each step in more detail. After collecting the first note, starting the quest, you'll be sent to Hircine's Shrine to the south of the Imperial City to find another note. The first note pushes you towards Hircine's Shrine where you need to follow \"his wolf's gaze\". This is trying to tell you that the wolf statue in the shrine is pointing in the direction of the next note. To find it,face Hircine's Shrine and turn rightalmost 140°to find a birch tree in the direction of the wolf, slightly lower down the hill. The note is on the back of the tree, so you won't immediately see it. After collecting the note at Hircine's Shrine, you'll then be sent towards Molag Bal's Shrine to follow \"the Light of the Dawn\". This cryptic clue had me pretty confused at first, though it's actually really simple if you ignore the hint and look around yourself. To find the third note,face Molag Bal's Shrine and turn directly to your right, where you'll see the note attached to a thick tree. Since it's pinned to the front side of the tree, you'll be able to see this one from where you're standing. As the previous note hints, the fourth and final note is at the lucky Old Lady's statue in Bravil. Travel to the Bay Roan Stables outside Bravil, head through the main doors, and take the second right, where you'll see the statue outside the church. I'll admit, this pamphlet took me quite a while to find, but it's hiding in plain sight. Face the statue and look down to your right, where you'll find the note attached to the inner side of the low wall around the statue. After you've found the final note, you'll then be sent to the Lonely Suitor Lodge in Bravil to find a \"shy Dunmer\". The culprit you're looking for isRanaline. Speak to her and click the persuasion minigame icon in the bottom left, where you can then either persuade or bribe her to improve your rapport. Once you've done that, say \"Mythic Dawn notes\" to complete Burning Trail. You'll automatically be given the next quest, The Crimson Cave, which sends you to Mingo Cave. To complete The Crimson Cave: Like the A Wound in Time questline, you're not immediately given your rewards. To claim your bounty, you'll need to use the Summon Mehrunes' Harbinger spell to call this NPC back, where you can then sift through the various rewards. Again, you won't have room for everything, so pick and choose what you want. You can always summon them again to get more.

You likely will have spied someblue rockswhile exploring the continent inClair Obscur: Expedition 33. These Paint Spikes, as they're actually known, often block secret routes and treasure you can claim, but first you have to unlock the upgrade that lets you break them. Bad news, too, this upgrade isn't on the main path. Instead, it's the reward for an optional quest, so it's possible to miss it entirely. If you're here looking for how to get past the blue rocks on the overworld map—these are different from paint spikes—you'll be able to do this once you unlock Esquie in the main story, so just keep on progressing. Otherwise, here's how to get the upgrade that lets you break Paint Spikes in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. To break Paint Spikes,you'll need the Paint Break upgrade, which you can get from Sastro for rescuing four of hislost Gestral kids. Sastro appears in your camp shortly after you visit the Gestral Village in the main story, but his quest to track down lost Gestrals is entirely optional. To find Sastro, you need to: the main story. He's easy to recognise either way, since he's a big Gestral wearing a chef's hat. As you find his lost kids—locations in the linked guide above—he'll give you rewards, and after you track down four, you'll get Paint Break. To use Paint Break, you simply have topress the right-shoulder button on controller, since it's an upgrade to the ability you usually use to begin combat with an enemy. Most Paint Spikes contain items, but some block hidden routes which contain tougher Chromatic bosses and even special loot such as pictos.

    "article_text": "Another side quest involving an amulet. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. To begin theGoblin Diplomacyquest in RuneScape: Dragonwilds, you need to pick up the Bandosian Amulet from a goblin camp in the middle of a lake southeast from Bramblemead Valley. Defeat the goblins in that camp and head down the stairs. Your path will be blocked by thorny vines on the right, so you'll need to chop them down to get ahold of the Reliquary. Interact with this with E to receive the Bandosian Amulet. Similarly to the Restless Ghosts quest, this will automatically begin the quest but not give you many clues on what to do from here. You're challenged to find someone who knows something about the amulet, but that's it. Here's what you need to do. To continue the Goblin Diplomacy quest, find Zanik at the edge of a cliff by a tent in northeast Bramblemead Valley.Zanik will explain that she recognises the amulet but you've only got one half and you'll need to find the second before she can be of any help. You'll also get a hint about the whereabouts, but it's not a detailed description since you're just told to visit a cave in the northeast. After getting this clue,go to the Whispering Swamp and find the cave in the northeastwith a clay deposit outside. You need to go inside, where you'll have to fight a level 3 Garou Druid. Keep your distance during this fight since this mob deals poison damage, and it's a pretty strong enemy if you've only just started the game. You can lure it out of the cave by attacking with a bow and then running, which gives you more space to work with.When you've defeated the Druid, you'll berewarded with the other half of the Bandosian Amulet. There is also a chest in this cave which contains some materials like Swamp Tar and Rune Essence which are worth grabbing while you're here.Go back to Zanik with both halves of the amulet to complete the quest.

    "title": "Thermal imaging seems to show there are 'weak point' hot spots in some RTX 50-series graphics cards",
    "article_text": "But don't worry about your graphics card melting just yet When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. After extensively poking and prodding RTX 50-series AIB graphics cards, veritable tech demigod Igor Wallossek of Igor's Lab has discovered that there are potentiallyconcerning hotspots on many RTX 50-series AIB partner cards. These hotspots seem to essentially and most directly be caused by power delivery components being placed too close together on the PCBs and connected via too few traces, although it seems that at least some of this density could in part be a result of an oversight in an Nvidia guide for board partners. That's because, according to Igor, who references an RTX 40-series Thermal Design Guide due to an NDA looming over the one for RTX 50-series ones, the guide is \"far too imprecise and incomplete\", especially concerning the specific area where the hotspots are occurring. Although the two cards in focus are the Palit GeForceRTX 5080Gaming Pro OC and PNY GeForceRTX 5070OC, Igor claims the hotspot can be seen on many more cards than these. It can apparently be seen in the same spot on \"cards from major board partners such as Palit, PNY and MSI as well as variants from other manufacturers.\" This can even occur on \"cards that at first glance appear to be uncritical in terms of performance, such as an RTX 5060 Ti\" because \"even cards with a peak power of just 180 watts can be affected if the topology is concentrated on just a few supply phases and the problem persists due to the concentration.\" So what's the issue exactly? Essentially—and to simplify something that Igor explains in much more detail—these 50-series PCBs seem to be designed in such a way that the densely packed VRMs concentrate the heat generated by the high current flows into a small area. It's not just about having too few VRMs, either, as it's especially pronounced where the vias (vertical connections through the PCB) pass through the copper power planes. They're closely routed together, resulting in a lack of vertical heat dissipation. This leads to the hotspots that Igor identified. In the RTX 5080 he tested, the temperature in this spot reached over 80 °C and in the RTX 5070 he tested, it reached over 107 °C. While these temperatures might not cause immediate instability, the problem is that this might not be good for long-term stability. Igor says: Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"Current-carrying paths are often routed up to the load limit of the thermal and electrical specification, with no additional leeway for ageing, manufacturing variation or load peaks. This results in structures that function reliably under ideal conditions but react sensitively to minor deviations in cooling, placement or load distribution.\" The key phrase here is \"under ideal conditions\", and therein lies the possible criticism of Nvidia's Thermal Design Guide and one possible root cause of this hotspot problem. The Thermal Design Guide is what Nvidia gives out to AIB partners, cooler developers, and so on, to set the standard(s) to compare different components' thermal planning against. According to Igor, using the RTX 4090's Thermal Design Guide as an example, there are some problems with Nvidia's guide or the AIB partners' use of it. The overarching problem is that \"many of the parameters are idealized assumptions that are relativized in practical implementation by various influencing factors.\" In other words, its standards don't seem to be applicable to real-world use, at least not without risking thermal issues. In fact, he presses this point home in regards to the hotspot issue he identified, saying: \"It is remarkable that this particular area is not highlighted as a critical area in its own right in the official Thermal Design Guide.\" Igor also goes on to demonstrate that it wouldn't take much to solve the issue. All one needs to do is create a \"thermal relief\" (a thermal pad) on the back of the graphics card where the hotspot is located, to help dissipate the heat. Best CPU for gaming: The top chips from Intel and AMD.Best gaming motherboard: The right boards.Best graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits.Best SSD for gaming: Get into the game ahead of the rest. This kind of solution is something that cooler manufacturers for these graphics cards could have presumably implemented had they known about the problem. Which is something that, also presumably, the Thermal Design Guide could and perhaps should have alerted them to. As with most things in the industry, though, root causes are rarely simple to identify. Igor points out from the start that there are multiple kinds of actor involved in the production of a graphics card, and it might in fact be the poor communication and collaboration between different actors that can lead to such issues: \"Layout managers at board partners are often directly dependent on external PCB suppliers and have to adapt their designs to cooler solutions, which in turn are created under separate design and manufacturing premises. The lack of interoperation between these development lines then leads to design compromises which—as in the present case—can have unfavorable thermal effects without one of the parties involved being able to fully oversee this in isolation.\" Too many cooks can spoil a broth, perhaps? Whatever the case, I wouldn't worry too much about hotspots on your RTX 50-series GPUs just yet. These kinds of temperatures shouldn't cause short-term issues; the concern is more that GPU lifespans could be shortened over the course of a few years. This isn't great, of course, but you shouldn't have to worry about your graphics card melting because of one of these hotspots any time soon.

In case the approximately 60,000 Oblivion-related stories we've published in the last 24 hours have escaped you, it's feasting season for Elder Scrolls fans right now. The release of Oblivion Remastered has seenover 120,000 playerspour into Cyrodiil at once, and I suspect it might beat that record this coming weekend. But you know what?Whatever. Because as if that wasn't enough, the good folks over atTamriel Rebuilt—the Morrowind mega-mod that aims to build the entire Morrowind province mainland into the game—also chose yesterday to tease the release of its next big update: Grasping Fortune. I first saw the tease on TR's own Discord server, where project senior dev Sultan of Rum posted a symbol of some scales in a very Morrowind-y triangle above some Daedric text. \"Coming soon,\" said ol' Rum, tantalisingly. I entered detective mode. I pulled up theUESP's Daedric alphabet pageand carefully translated the message. It very clearly read \"Grasping Fortune,\" the name of TR's next update. Feel very smug about cracking the case, I then visitedTR's Bluesky, where it had posted the same teaser with the hashtag \"#GraspingFortune\". That'll teach me to ever try. More details coming very soon. #ElderScrolls #Morrowind #TamrielRebuilt #GraspingFortune pic.twitter.com/2ZQUKQSC2FApril 22, 2025 Previously, the TR team has said that Grasping Fortune \"will extend the available mainland all the way to Morrowind’s southwestern border with Cyrodiil.\" That's the province Oblivion's set in, in case you forgot. It'll also add Narsis, the capital city of Morrowind's House Hlaalu. That's the House that's all about trade, diplomacy, and Imperial sympathies, in contrast to Houses Telvanni (magic, slavery), Dagoth (plague, world domination) and Redoran (swords, swords). Here's a map of the area being added. I can't wait. I've been enjoying Oblivion Remastered—the original game was formative for me as a 12 year old—but I'm a crusty old Morrowind fan at heart.

Restless Ghostsis one of many obscure side quests you'll pick up while exploring Ashenfall inRunescape: Dragonwilds, specifically, when youvisit the Crumbling Well in Bramblemead. When you're nearby, you'll be able to interact with the well by pressing E, which lets you retrieve the mysterious Ghostspeak Amulet, and immediately begins the quest. Annoyingly, though, you aren't given much explanation as to what you're supposed to do with it. If you open your map to check the quest, it just says \"search for a purpose for the Amulet of Ghostspeak.\"What this really means is that you'll need to track down some ghosts which canonly be found at night. You need to find four ghosts before you can lay the spirits to rest. So, hide out in your house until night, and then you can start the journey to completing this quest. Warren is the first ghost you need to track down , and you canfind him in the same area where you picked up the amulet. For me, he was located just to the left of the well, hiding in one of the abandoned houses. Interact with him, and he will give you a riddle that helps you find the next ghost: This riddlesends you to the windmill in Temple Woods, which is the same place you had to go and kill giant rats if you did the tutorial.

    "title": "A graphical history of Far Cry: 17 years of huge maps, epic vistas, and fast food fighting fun",
    "article_text": "Open-world mayhem at its best. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. When you think of the Far Cry games, what do you picture? I see beautiful ocean views, lots of guns, frantic battles, and a host of semi-unstable characters acting out a larger-than-life story. That's how they've been almost since the very first one came out in 2004, and for 17 years,Ubisofthas stuck to the theme of bullet-flinging anarchy. There's no sign of a new one coming out just yet, but since we've just enjoyed a new (and surprisingly good) Assassin's Creed game, it perhaps won't be long before we're back in the action. Until then, let's have a look through the six major releases and three smaller standalones that make up the Far Cry franchise. Not only will you get to see what each Far Cry game looks like at its very best, but we'll go through what made each one different from the others, either in terms of graphics and tech, or gameplay features and story elements. If you've not played any of the games in the franchise, this walk through Far Cry's history might be just the thing to get you hooked. All the footage you'll see was captured at 4K using the game's maximum graphics settings, using a CyberPowerPC/MSI gaming rig (Ryzen 7 9800X3D,GeForce RTX 5080). Load up on guns, bring your friends, it's Far Cry time. Kick-starting the whole franchise is the original Far Cry, created by German developer,Crytek, which made its own engine (CryEngine) to handle the game code. At the time, it was a technical tour de force for PC gaming, and its use of shaders and textures still holds up quite well today. There was certainly nothing to touch it for foliage, draw distance, and water effects in 2004. While the tropical island setting appears completely open-world in nature, the game's structure is almost entirely linear. However, the fundamental gameplay elements—you and lots of guns versus endless quantities of enemies to mow down—would go on to be reprised in all but one of the Far Cry releases. The above clip of Far Cry is perhaps a little misleading, with regards to the quality of the graphics, as the capture wasn't done with stock settings. The game's launcher lets you jump into some of the finer aspects of the graphics configuration, and what you're seeing here is with everything maxed out (e.g. 16x anisotropic filtering, ultra-fast environment refresh rate in reflections). In 2004, no gaming PC would have been able to run Far Cry like this at 4K, but with anRTX 5080, it's a breeze. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. This would be the first and last Far Cry game that Crytek made for Ubisoft, due to the developer signing a deal with Electronic Arts that ultimately resulted inCrysis. But Ubisoft arranged its own deal with Crytek for the Far Cry IP and a perpetual licence to CryEngine. It was Ubisoft's Montreal studio in Canada that was tasked with coming up with a sequel, and itscoders went to work on updating CryEngine, to support destructible environments, fire mechanics, and better physics and animation. The significantly rewritten engine was named Dunia, andFar Cry 2was its first public airing. Eschewing the linear structure of the first game, Far Cry 2 is genuinely open-world, and perhaps a little too non-linear for its own good. Set in the savannah of a fictitious African country, the vistas are certainly not as eye-catching as those in Far Cry, and the muted palette and textures belie the heavy graphics processing taking place. No modern gaming rig will struggle, of course, but you will get all kinds of game-breaking bugs occurring if you don't cap the frame rate to 60 fps or lower. That's because the physics scripts are synchronised with the frames, so if they run too quickly/frequently, you get all kinds of funny things going on. This is something that's common to many games from this era, especially those that are multi-platform releases. It's not the best-looking game in the series, the combat is poor, and the malaria mechanic is somewhat tiresome, but underneath it all, Far Cry 2 is perhaps the best example of the series' do-anything-you-like nature. At the very least, the player's background (mercenary for hire) makes a lot more sense than that of the next one. Heading back to the tropics, Ubisoft spent many years creating its perfect paradise for open-world exploring and fighting. Dunia was further refined—becoming Dunia 2 in the process—with better water and weather rendering, motion capture and animation, and adecent attempt at global illumination. Far Cry 3's story is perhaps the weakest of them all, mostly because of how quickly a rich college jock transforms into a one-man slaughterhouse, dispatching fauna and flora alike with ease. Still, at least it has one best ever villains in a game, Vaas, though it's a shame that his character is rather wasted. Despite having some of the best graphics in a PC game for its time, Ubisoft chose not to offer a benchmark mode inFar Cry 3. The original game doesn't have one either, but you can record gameplay and play it back in-game, via console commands. Perhaps it was to disguise the fact that, at maximum graphics settings, the game's performance wasn't exactly stellar at launch. If you've watched the above video and thought that there's something odd about the graphics, then don't worry, you're not just imagining things. Far Cry 3 uses screen space ambient occlusion to give objects a more realistic sense of lighting and shadows around them, and its maximum setting rather overdoes it—to the point it's almost like cel shading. Despite its shortcomings, Far Cry 3 was a huge hit on release, and it's a lot of fun to play. Some gamers might not like the repetitive nature of unlocking towers, taking over bases, and slowly grinding through the map, but it's been perfect fun for millions of people. Initially intended as a DLC for Far Cry,Blood Dragonwas released as a standalone game in its own right. It's a pastiche of every 1980s gung-ho action and sci-fi movie you can think of, and while the humour won't be to everyone's taste, the combat certainly should be. The developers stripped everything right back to focus on you, guns, and lots of shooting. They had to, though, as Ubisoft wanted the project done very swiftly, and some of the assets from Far Cry 3 are reused in Blood Dragon. To disguise this, the game is set almost entirely during the night, so you need to look really carefully at the vegetation, for example, to spot its FC3 origins. The next major entry in the Far Cry franchise is number four, which commenced development immediately after Ubisoft Montreal finished Assassin's Creed III. Dunia 2 was used again and once more, received a flurry oftweaks and updatesto improve the graphics and animations. For starters, the iffy ambient occlusion in Far Cry 3 was replaced by something far more robust (HBAO+developed by Nvidia), along with a shadow system that greatly improved the accuracy of soft edges (PCSS, also developed by Nvidia). Add in nicer lighting, and it was a genuine step forward for Ubisoft's engine. Far Cry 4 is arguably a rise-and-repeat of Far Cry 3, though the Himalayan setting gives the game world a somewhat narrower feel to it than its predecessor. However, Ubisoft significantly increased the vertical scale of the map, and although you don't have the ultimate freedom to fly anywhere you like, FC4 has some of the best vistas in the series. It feels more polished, too, with weapons and vehicles having more control and bite to them than those in FC3. Plus, you get to ride elephants and bash people and cars out of the way, and the game's worth playing just for that. There's a vast amount to discover and do, and even if some of it is rather repetitive (unlocking towers by climbing to the top, once again), it's a perfect game to unwind with after a long day of work. Primal is what happens when somebody asks, \"What would Far Cry 4 be like if it was set in the past, say 10,000 years ago?\" That question was clearly raised at some point after FC4 was finished, because that's precisely what Far Cry Primal is—to the point that the map is actually the same, albeit reskinned to look suitably Palaeolithic. Unusually for a Far Cry game, there's no multiplayer element, which is a shame as hunting mammoths and sabre-tooth tigers by yourself is no laughing matter.Far Cry Primalis still a lot of fun, though, and one could argue that it actually has some of the best combat of all the FC games. It also has some excellent graphics, and they've aged incredibly well. The high-quality motion capture, especially that of facial movements, helps a lot, but the overall lighting, shadows, and textures are top-tier. To showcase the pretties, Ubisoft added a benchmark for Primal (though oddly not for FC4), but it focuses a little too much on water graphics, rather than showing off the game's epic views. Shame, then, that the overall story and game structure aren't as solid as those in Far Cry 3 and 4, and while the open-world looks ripe for exploring, the fact that it's set in the Stone Age means there's relatively little to see or do, other than offing baddies. Still, lobbing a spear into somebody's head in Primal feels like headshots perfected. Perhaps the most Far Cry out of all the Far Cry games, number five ups the ante when it comes to a sense of scale and openness. Want to just let the world burn while you do a spot of fishing? Go right ahead. Fancy taking a plane out for a spin and strafing a few camps and structures? Not a problem. Wish you could rely on an in-game companion to help out, rather than relying on co-op?Far Cry 5has got just the ticket. Although Ubisoft was still using Dunia 2, the engine was the same as that in FC3 in name only. By 2018, it had been massively updated and overhauled, and it's well worth checking out thislong video presentationon all of the rendering tricks Ubisoft pulled out to make FC5. The game enjoyed a lot of commercial success on release, though it also attracted a fair amount of controversy. Partially because of its setting (a small rural country in America reminiscent of Montana), but mostly because of the integral use of far-right theatrics and drug-guided religious fanaticism in the story. The latter was also critically received rather poorly. If one ignores all of that (and the less-than-satisfactory ending), Far Cry 5 perhaps offers the most fun out of all the FC games. There's a huge amount to see and do; it's a measure of how good Far Cry 5 is when you feel sad once everything has been ticked off and completed. New Dawn picks up where Far Cry 5 ends, albeit by a number of years, and once again, it's you who's here to save the day (or overly-vibrant post-nuclear rural country, in this case) with that special blend of combat, vehicles, and companions. Planned as a smaller project right from the start, New Dawn's map is far more concise than FC5's so there's considerably less to explore and do. And in terms of graphics or other gaming tech, nothing new was brought to bear—just a reuse of the same mechanics (and some assets) to tide you over while the next major Far Cry game was being developed. That said, the base building element was new and gaveFar Cry New Dawna better sense of who you were trying to help out, rather than just being a lone warrior, out to wreak havoc on the hordes of baddies. And so we come to the final Far Cry game in the franchise so far. It's almost been four years sinceFar Cry 6was released, and looking back through the timeline of the other games suggests that we're due another one soon. However, Ubisoft's recent financial woes probably mean the next Far Cry will have been paused until the publisher can be certain of it being a major hit. That's possibly down to the fact that while Far Cry 6 sold quite well, it wasn't as successful as its predecessor, and it garnered lacklustre reviews. The game's world is vast and detailed, and the Dunia 2 engine arguably produces the best graphics of the whole franchise in this form. Evenray tracing makes an appearance, though for nothing more than making puddles of water reflect the environment better. Far Cry 6 has all the gung-ho, gun-slinging elements that are the hallmark of every FC game (bar Primal, of course), and there's no shortage of bases and enemies to battle against. Ubisoft packed FC6 with a host of additional features to keep you playing the game, and yet, for all its wonderful chaos, the story doesn't quite hit home. Let's finish this amble through Far Cry's history by considering what's next for the franchise in terms of rendering, as graphics have been a major component of what makes an FC game… well… an FC game! Ubisoft's studios use a host of different engines, but two of its biggest—Anvil for Assassin's Creed and Snowdrop for The Division, Avatar and Star Wars Outlaw—are perhaps the best ones to use to judge what'll happen with Dunia. Ray tracing will almost certainly be present in the next Far Cry game, but perhaps not to the extent that it is with the recent Snowdrop-powered games. In those, ray tracing isalwaysused, and while it can be done on GPUs with RT units, they're games that are best played on modern graphics cards. Assassin's Creed Shadowsonly forces ray tracing on in the main home base; outside of that, it's entirely optional, though the game does look nice with it enabled. Given that Far Cry games lean heavily on the visuals, I suspect that the next one will fall in the Assassin's Creed camp and use it selectively. That's because Far Cry worlds have always been heavily detailed, especially when it comes to foliage and other assets that give ray tracing a headache to deal with. That said,Avatar: Frontiers of Pandorais rich with detail and packed with trees and plants, so it's not impossible that Far Cry 7 will be permanently ray-traced. But the aesthetics of a game are more than just lighting, shadows, and reflections. One criticism of Far Cry worlds is the relatively lack of interactivity they have, especially in terms of destructibility. There is some element of that in FC games, of course, but ramping this up (e.g. in the form of buildings that can be fully destroyed) would make the next Far Cry game stand out. One last thing to consider iswhereis next for Far Cry? Will Ubisoft return to Africa or try somewhere like Alaska, where it can return to including snow and ice in the graphics? Wherever it does head off to, you can be sure that some elements will just be the same: lots of guns, lots of fighting, lots of kooky characters that will tag along for the mayhem. Perhaps gamers want more than just shooting people and animals, wrapped in a silly story, but to me, Far Cry has always been about blowing off some steam and having a (literal) blast. It's the fast food of the game industry, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.

After a short stint working at Beyond3D.com, Nick joined Futuremark (MadOnion rebranded) full-time, as editor-in-chief for its gaming and hardware section, YouGamers. After the site shutdown, he became an engineering and computing lecturer for many years, but missed the writing bug.

    "title": "Behold! A single QR code containing a miniaturized take on Doom: 'literally the entire game'",
    "article_text": "Asking the question that never gets old. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There's something a bit magical about shareware stalwart Doom and folks' compulsion to make it run on absolutely everything. Present a sufficiently motivated individual with the game's open source code, and a less than powerful bit of kit offering maybe the barest whisper of a GUI, and you can be sure they'll put two and two together. So, when I ask 'what does apregnancy test,gut bacteria, and100 pounds of moldy potatoesall have in common?', you know the answer. Well, now we can add QR codes to that list—with an asterisk. Developer Kuber Mehta has created something exceedingly light-weight that can be compressed, encoded into, and then extracted from a single QR code (viaTechSpot). However, as the developer chronicles in a recentblog post, it turns out getting Doom itself to run via QR code is actually not that straightforward. Just for a start, QR codes can only encode up to 3 KB of data, and as Mehta points out, the original Doom's chaingun sprite alone is an absolutely whopping 1.2 KB. So, the developer decided upon a compromise, writing that his eventual 'absurd premise' became \"Create a playable DOOM-inspired game smaller than three paragraphs of plain text.\" So, it's notactuallyDoom—that's the asterisk—but Mehta's game is definitely Doom-like. Taking heavy inspiration not just from the original 1993 shooter, but liminal space creepypastaThe Backroomsas well, Mehta's project is called 'the backdooms.' It's very silly as names go, but I'm still kicking myself for not having come up with it. Crafted in HTML, Mehta had to make every character of his code count, and he was able to compress variables to single letters by using what he describes as \"EXTREMELY aggressive minification\". Looking at the resulting code kind of makes me feel like a Doom demon taking a headshot, but I'm nonetheless impressed. Unfortunately, encoding HTML into a QR code is also not a walk in the park, with the usual go-to Base64 conversion route leaving very little of an already meagre storage budget for the game itself. So, Mehta turned to the cursed trinity ofChatGPT, DeepSeek, andClaudeto source a solution. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Demonstrating why AI chatbots are not especially useful referencing tools, Mehta writes, \"I talked to [the three AI chatbots] for two days, whenever I could [...] 100 different prompts to each one to try to do something about this situation (and being told every single time hosting it on a website is easier!?) Then, ChatGPT casually threw in DecompressionStream [a WebAPI component built into most browsers].\" This was not the last hurdle for the project to creatively hurl itself over. Though the backdooms originally used tiny baked-in maps, Mehta instead chose to implement maps based on a seed that infinitely generates. While somewhat random, this means maps can be retrieved if you've got the seed number it was generated from—however, the real magic trick was then making this look like even rudimentary 3D. Borrowing a page out of Doom's original playbook, Mehta deployed a simplified version of raycasting—so, technically, this (and the original Doom) is a 2D game in a trench coat. As a result of all of the above constraints, 'the backdooms' is a visually limited project,seeing you avoiding red-eyed rectangles amid grey walls, but it definitely gets the point across. You can take a deeper dive into the guts of the project yourselfvia GitHub. Naturally, compressing everything into a QR code isn't going to be practical for most projects, but it's definitely in the shareware spirit of the original Doom. Thrifty use of underpowered resources is always impressive—especially whena powerful quantum computer struggles to run even a wireframe version of Doom.Along the lines of getting the most out of incredibly limited foundations, you may also be interested in Roche Limit,a horror game made entirely in PowerPoint. Despite the jaunty trailer, that's a project with a powerfully cursed (though no less compelling) vibe.

    "article_text": "It's probably time to rectify that. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Crusader Kings 3, Paradox's brilliant RPG/grand strategy hybrid, has reached a pretty significant milestone, hitting the four million sales mark a bit over four years after it launched. Now, that's a pretty hefty number for what you might consider a fairly niche strategy romp. Certainly, Paradox has reason to be pleased. And I don't want to be the one to rain on the parade, but still: the number really should be greater. I've been gushing about the series for about as long as I've been spitting out hot takes. WhileBaldur's Gate 3might be the game I gave my highest review score to (at least in the hallowed halls of PC Gamer), CK3 is my forever game. Every time I start up a new game, picking another dynasty to lead to glory or ignominy, I am still stunned by the absurdity of what's on offer here—especially when you throw in the DLC. I can spend the weekend creating a Viking kingdom in Egypt; craft my own bespoke, complex religion; bless the world with an entirely new culture; engage in some cannibalism; host the grandest tournaments the medieval world has ever seen; or just set off on a meandering adventure around the world, making friends, enemies and lovers. My particular videogame fetish is the crafting of wholly original stories that sprout out of random events and my own whims.

And yes, if you have to ask, I am still pretty sore about our 2020 GOTY going toDeath bloody Strandinginstead of the actual best game of the year. I'm still planning my revenge. If you are a bit tempted to check it out for the first time, you've picked a good moment. The last expansion,Roads to Power, is one of the best DLCs Paradox has ever developed, fully committing to the incredible RPG side of things by letting you become a wandering, landless noble, getting into scrapes and only putting down roots for long enough to get some coin and some stories. And the upcomingKhans of the Steppe expansionis a pretty exciting prospect, too, allowing you to sit atop your horse as a khan, leading your nomadic horde towards all those tantalisingly wealthy cities, all begging to be pillaged. Even though it's been kicking around since 2020, it's only getting bigger and better, and you probably don't want to miss out.

    "title": "Intel will reportedly fire fully 20% of its workforce and focus on 'engineering', a plan that sounds all too familiar at this point",
    "article_text": "New CEO, same old staff cuts? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Intel is planning to slash 20% of its workforce, or fully one in five employees.According to Bloomberg, Intel will announce the move later this week when it details its latest financial figures on Thursday. Reportedly, the staff cuts will be pitched as part of a broader strategy to focus on engineering while streamlining operations and reducing bureaucracy. It's not entirely clear whether these cuts will be on top of the 15% reduction in work force Intel announced in August last year, or if the new 20% figure incorporates those job losses in part or whole. If the new cuts are entirely separate, that would mean around a third of Intel's employees being let go, overall, since August 2024. The 15% cuts in August totalled around 17,500 workers, bringing Intel's head count down to roughly 100,000. A further 20% cut would see Intel's workforce shrink to about 80,000. Intel's head count peaked at 131,000 in 2022,according to Statistica. So, 80,000 would be a dramatic drop in just three or so years. To put those numbers in to further context, AMD current has a little under 30,000 employees. Nvidia's workforce, meanwhile, numbers roughly 35,000. In other words, even after these mooted cuts, Intel will still be a very, very large operation with extensive human resources. After all, Intel not only has similar chip design operations as AMD and Nvidia. Uniquely, it also has its own chip production facilities, or fabs, something AMD and Nvidia lack. This news comes just over a month after Intel appointed a new CEO,Lip-Bu Tan. Earlier this month, Tan conceded that Intel needed to \"correct past mistakes\" and promised a return to its roots as \"an engineering first company.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Of course, a return to an engineering focus was exactly what Intel's previous CEO, Pat Gelsinger, had also promised. Reportedly, the Intel board did not feel that Gelsinger's plan was moving fast enough. So, perhaps firing 20,000 employees within months of taking over is the kind of swift action Tan needs to maintain board confidence. On the other hand, another massive head-count cull will hardly be confidence inspiring for investors and other outside observers. Whatever, one thing seems certain. If this latest news is true, things will likely get worse for Intel before they get better as the company goes through the painful process of shedding staff before rebuilding.

    "title": "Fallout 3 Remastered seems almost inevitable now, but still a long way off",
    "article_text": "And like the big sucker that I am, I'd lap it up. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Modern Bethesda likes to take its time. Starfield was in active development for eight years before it was able to disappoint cosmic explorers. The Elder Scrolls 6, meanwhile, was announced way back in 2018, didn't enter active development until 2023, and won't launch until 2026 at the earliest—and let's face it, it's gonna be a lot longer. The chances of us getting a brand new Fallout this decade, then, are pretty slim. But you know Todd and his buds are desperately trying to figure out how to capitalise on the series' popularity, especially in the face of the ongoingAmazon TV show, which is gearing up for its second season. Sure, Fallout 76's live service format means it will continue to grow, bringing in new players and more cash, but it's no replacement for a new Fallout game. So what's the solution? I'd be willing to bet a case of Nuka Cola on Bethesda trying to replicate the already significant success ofOblivion Remastered. And it's an incredibly safe bet, given the mention of a Fallout 3 remaster in the sameleaked FTC documentsthat confirmed Oblivion Remastered was coming. It makes a lot of sense. Even if Bethesda was up for getting another studio to develop a new Fallout, like Obsidian and Fallout: New Vegas, that would still take forever to appear. A remaster, though? That seems more feasible. Something that another studio could do without needing too much from Bethesda, while it works on TES6. Feasible, but not immediate, mind you. We first heard about Oblivion Remastered in 2023, which was a yearafterit was meant to have come out—at least according to the leaked FTC document. We don't know how long it was in active development for, but a remaster of this scale doesn't just magically appear. If Bethesda's using Virtuos again, then it seems unlikely active development on a Fallout 3 remaster would have kicked off until very recently. But if it's not Virtuos, that opens things up a bit. The leaked document isn't particularly helpful here, unfortunately, since it seemed pretty speculative. And it was from a 2020 presentation. It took three extra years for Oblivion to come out. It had Fallout 3 Remastered down for 2024, and obviously that never happened. Going on Oblivion Remastered's timeline, we might be looking at a 2027 release. That's the predicted release date plus three years. At least that's still this decade. But without knowing when active development began (if it's already begun), it's hard to predict a realistic timeline. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Still, yesterday's (kinda) surprise drop of Oblivion Remastered is reassuring. Because the dates in the FTC leak were completely off, it seemed like both remasters could have been shelved. Even clearly legit leaks like this should be taken with a grain of salt because companies pivot all the time, and countless games get cancelled long before they're announced. But Oblivion Remastered is finally a tangible thing we can actually play, which makes Fallout 3 Remastered all the more likely. Prolific leaker Nate the Hate is also still convinced it's coming, too, though he reckons it will \"be a while\" before it appears. I do wish it would hurry up, though. The show has reinvigorated my love for the series, and while I've had fun with Fallout 76, especially now that I canfinally play as a ghoul, it's simply not as good an RPG as Fallout 3. The survival nonsense and focus on crafting and multiplayer means it's not even trying to be. It's a small-scale survival MMO, and there are already far too many of them. Mind you, I'd much rather live in the universe where Bethesda wanted to remaster my favourite games rather than the runner ups. Oblivion ain't no Morrowind, and Fallout 3 sure as hell ain't Fallout: New Vegas. But we can't have it all, I guess. Fraser is the UK online editor and has actually met The Internet in person.

    "article_text": "Hawk your ill-gotten gains to make mountains of gold. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Working out how tosell stolen itemsinOblivionis one of your first steps as an enterprising thief or regular old RPG player. Honestly, even when I'm playing a good character I still steal like an absolute menace, and I'm certain I'm not alone in that. Being a thief in Oblivion is one of the most lucrative ways to play, and perhaps the most rewarding thief experience in the entire series, considering merchants have unlimited gold. If you're tired of lockpicking to filch valuable items, you might also want to track down theSkeleton Keyto make things easier. Either way, here's how to sell stolen items—the ones marked with the little hand symbol that shows you pinched them—in Oblivion. To sell stolen items,you need access to a fence—a merchant who specialises in stolen goods—and sadly, there's only one fence available if you don'tjoin the Thieves Guild. This is Manheim Maulhand, the owner of the Inn of Ill Omen on the road between the Imperial City and Bravil. Since he only has a 50 gold limit and lives in the ass end of nowhere, I'd honestly just recommend you join the Thieves Guild instead. Upon joining the guild,you can sell stolen goods to Ongar the World-Wearyin Bruma—either find him in his home, south of the church, or in Olav's Tap and Tack just to the left as you enter the city. Ongar has a purchase limit of 600 gold, which is more than enough to get started. As you fence stolen goods and complete special jobs, you'll also be promoted by the guild and gain access to fences with higher purchase limits in other cities. If you're ever in doubt about what fences you have access to, go see Armand Christophe in the Garden of Dareloth in the Imperial City Waterfront at midnight—where you undertook the trial to join the guild. Choose the \"About the Thieves Guild\" dialogue option and then \"Where can I find a fence?\"This gives you a list of all the fences available to you, besides Manheim Maulhand, and he'll direct you to each when you select their name.

The quest tojoin the Thieves GuildinOblivionis one of the funnest faction introductions in the series, as you follow rumours of the Gray Fox to a mysterious garden, and compete with fellow thieves to steal a diary before the night ends. \"Why join the Thieves Guild?\" you may well ask, given you can simply steal whatever you want anyway. One key benefit the guild offers is the ability tosell stolen items, and considering Oblivion's merchants only have a purchase limit and infinite gold otherwise, it's extremely lucrative to be a thief. If you like the sound of that but can't be arsed with lockpicking, you might also want to find theSkeleton Key. Otherwise, here's how to join the thieves guild in Oblivion. It's surprisingly easy to become part of the Thieves Guild in Oblivion and you can do it as soon as you exit the sewers near the Imperial City. Simply follow these steps: I'll walk you through stealing Amantius Allectus' diary down below, but the trickiest part of joining the Thieves Guild is using the persuading mechanic if you haven't before—you can select this in the bottom left when talking to someone. Honestly, the fastest way is just tobribe them with goldby selecting the left option on the wheel until their disposition—the central number—reaches the relevant number I list in the steps above. You may also struggle to find the Garden of Dareloth, but if you follow these steps, you should have a quest marker that indicates where it is. If you're still struggling: Though not much to look at, this is the Garden of Dareloth. Now, onto the diary. To join the Thieves Guild, you'll have to complete a trial. The May the Best Thief Win quest sees you facing off against two other thieves to steal the diary of Amantius Allectus. Armand Christophe suggests you talk to beggars to work out where he lives, but here's an even better idea: I'll tell you. Amantius Allectus lives in the Temple District—when leaving the district from the east, towards the Arboretum, his house is the first on the right.Pick the lock, head inside, and grab the diary from the desk on the right. If you do this straight away, you can beat Methredhel, the other thief you're competing against.If Methredhel grabs the diary first you'll either have to pickpocket it from her and break into her houseand steal it from her chest once she deposits it and goes to sleep. Thankfully she lives right next door to the Garden of Dareloth where you started, so that makes it nice and convenient. Bring the diary to Armand Christophe and congratulations, you're now a member of the Thieves Guild. Get out there and get stealing.

    "article_text": "Could *this* be the BIOS update to make Arrow Lake worth it for gaming? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Intel's Core Ultra 200S 'Arrow Lake' processors didn't exactly spark joy for us PC gamers when they launched last year. That could (emphasis on could) all be about to change, though, as Intel's just released an update that claims to improve gaming performance for the current-gen desktop CPUs. Enabling theIntel 200S Boost Overclocking Profilewill, apparently, result \"in a performance boost for low-latency workloads like gaming\" thanks to boosts in \"fabric, die-to-die, and memory frequencies.\" And it'll all be available without voiding your boxed processor's warranty from Intel. Specifically, (inter-die) fabric and die-to-die frequencies get boosted from 2.6 GHz and 2.1 GHz, respectively, to up to 3.2 GHz. DDR5 memory frequencies will permit up to 8000 MT/s (4,000 MHz), up from 6,400 MT/s (3,200 MHz). This is welcome news because the Core Ultra 200S chips didn't impress us for gaming when we tested them. They only sip at power, sure, and they're not half bad at productivity tasks (though they face stiff competition from AMD'sRyzen9000-series chips), but for gaming they're pretty underwhelming. This overclocking profile will, presumably, walk back on the whole 'super-low power while gaming' Arrow Lake theme, lifting the lid a little and allowing the juice-ometer to be dialled up. We won't know how that pans out until we've tested it ourselves (and on that note, watch this space), but whatever helps these chips close that performance gap will be worth it for gamers, by my estimation. TheIntel Core Ultra 5 245K, for instance, is pretty significantly behind even midrange previous-gen Intel and Ryzen chips when it comes to gaming. Our colleagues at Tom's Hardware had an early look at the update and have seen around a7% performance uplift in gamesfrom this Boost Overclocking Profile. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Hopefully this official profile will net better results than the updates we've seen until now, too. The firmware and software updates released up to January werepretty disappointing, to say the least. In our Nick's words, speaking about the few games he tested: \"Intel's fixes and Microsoft's Windows updates have barely made any difference and in some cases, it's made things significantly worse.\" Fingers crossed, then. This update should be rolling out across a ton of Z890 boards soon. Intel lists the following motherboards as ones that partners have already tested for the profile: Similarly, Intel lists the following memory kits as ones that partners have tested for it: Note that these lists aren't exhaustive of motherboards and memory kits that will work with the profile, either. For instance, G.Skill has already released amore extensive listof its compatible memory configurations. Intel assures us that \"eligible Intel Core Ultra 200S series processors will retain the three-year limited warranty provided by Intel\" but this only applies to boxed processors, ie, processors bought separately, not as part of an OEM or third-party-built system. Regarding this, Intel says: \"If your PC was purchased through a system builder or OEM, your warranty and support for that warranty are provided exclusively by the system builder or OEM. Please contact your OEM or reseller for warranty support or with any questions about your warranty.\" I've reached out to some OEMs and resellers for comment. Hopefully they will all honor existing warranties whether the new overclocking profile is enabled or not. Intel certainly seems to deem it safe enough, and so many partners having already tested it is a good sign, too. Fingers crossed.

    "title": "Bugaboo Pocket is a Tamagotchi full of creepy crawlies",
    "article_text": "Don't step on the little guy. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I grew up playing with a lot ofdesktop pets, which probably explains my need to have so many real ones now I have my own money and free will. But there's something about bugs which just puts me off owning them. Mostly because of their short lifespans and my larger critters which would eat a bug in a heartbeat. Luckily,Bugaboo Pockethas come along to satiate my yearning for more obscure animals without having to set up more tanks and clear more room in my house. If you had any generation of Tamagotchi in the past, you'll be familiar with the routine of Bugaboo Pocket. You start with a little golden insect egg which you need to nurture until it hatches into a small version of a bug: initially, a rubber ducky isopod. From here you raise it until it's fully grown while also doing things like cleaning up its mess, decorating its house, and most importantly making it wear little hats. By spending time with your little critter, a bond is formed, which can flourish into a friendship, exactly like a Tamagotchi, which is all documented in a tiny journal you can check at any time to see what your bug really thinks of you. Outside of forcing whatever outfits I could onto my fingernail-sized friends, my favourite part of Bugaboo Pocket is the mini games that come with each bug. Each species comes with a set of three minigames, all of which are slightly different to one another. For a rubber ducky isopod, you start with a game of pachinko before moving onto a game involving stacking blocks to create a path. When you eventually move onto hatching weevils you get to play a game like red light green light. But my favourite is the orchid mantis whose signature game is basically Fruit Ninja, except you get to chop up what looks like woodchips and your weapons are your own raptorial legs. These minigames are an incredibly fun way to shake up the routine of staring into the insect tank and praying something more exciting happens than watching them use the bathroom. There are also very simple quests, tasking you with raising bugs with specific personalities. But it's the minigames that kept me nurturing my little pets. Without them, Bugaboo Pocket It could quite easily slip exclusively into the idle category—at least if the bugs weren't so hungry all the time. You'll spend a lot of time sitting and waiting for something to happen, like your bug to growing up. But this also gives you a lot of time to sit and develop a connection with whichever insect you're raising. It's easy to become quite attached to them. Unfortunately, these insects don't last forever, and there comes a time where I have to let them go. And by let go I mean either preserve them as a wet specimen in a jar, bury them, or pin them to a board to make a taxidermy frame of them. After a fair few hours of playing and watching my bugs die, I couldn't help but question if I was doing something wrong. Sure, these things happen naturally, but at what point do you stop blaming the circle of life and start blaming yourself? I had to keep reminding myself that there's only so much you're actually responsible for in Bugaboo Pocket, so there's very little opportunity to mess up. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. But as is the way with things like this, the guilt becomes overwhelming when you're staring at a wall of all your pinned pets. I think that's just a me problem, though. I doubt anyone else playing will feel as responsible for their bundle of pixels. And it hasn't stopped me from hatching more and repeating the cycle, either. Kara is an evergreen writer.

PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. What is it?A time-hopping adventure game set in NYC. Release dateApril 23, 2024 DeveloperWadjet Eye Games PublisherWadjet Eye Games Reviewed onRTX 4090, Intel i9-13900k, 32GB RAM Steam DeckVerified LinkOfficial site Time travel is perhaps the most deliciously compelling of all the sci-fi conceits because it taps into something so incredibly human and primal that we're all burdened with: regret. By turning back the clock, we can fix all of our mistakes. A better version of our lives is just one time jump away—at least in Wadjet Eye's brilliant new adventure game, Old Skies. Not for Fia Quinn, though. A ChronoZen agent in 2060s New York, she serves as guide, bodyguard and fixer for tourists with enough money to book some time in the past. In this tantalisingly close future, she gets to watch people make their time tweaks, and all the changes they create just wash over her. See, like her fellow ChronoZen agents—and important historical events, people and even buildings—Fia's chronolocked. This means she's unaltered by the constant changes to the timeline—even her personal timeline. One moment, she might have a spouse and a child who she's never technically met before, the next she's a free-spirited party girl. But from her perspective, she's always the same Fia—immutable, diligent, lonely and dedicated entirely to the job. As we enter Fia's life, she's an experienced, busy agent helping her clients fix their present by exploring the past. It's a job that tends to come with complications. Sometimes clients go rogue. Simple missions might get tangled up in elaborate mysteries. And then there's the risk of getting shot in the head—something that happens repeatedly. It's a good thing her handler, Nozzo, always has a finger hovering over that rewind button. Old Skies' conundrums are not the sort of thing that'll lead to your own head wounds, as you smash your face against the keyboard. Indeed, most of the time they're pretty simple—at least compared to the ridiculous leaps that so many other point and clicks expect you to make. Logic and common sense will keep you moving forward at a good clip, most of the time. But the puzzles are also frequently tactile and playful, and crucially they don't forget that you're a time traveller. Sometimes that means you can resolve obstacles simply by searching the historical record. Other times, it means you'll need to hop between two different time periods, making changes in the past to solve problems at a later date. One of my favourites sees you trying to save your own life in 30 minutes by creating a life-saving drug that doesn't exist yet, using ingredients that have ceased to exist. I took a few notes here and there, but mostly because middle age has stolen my ability to remember things for more than a minute. Like most Wadjet Eye games, especially those created by Dave Gilbert, the puzzles are fun rather than challenging. But the end result is largely the same: I always feel incredibly satisfied. I might not feel like a genius for solving them, but they're still clever and fulfilling. One thing that is a little different from the rest of Wadjet Eye's oeuvre is the art. Artist Ben Chandler's vibrant, hand-painted backgrounds persist, but the character art has made the switch from intricate pixel art to something more evocative of a comic book: bold colours, thick lines, and a hand-drawn, sketched quality. I thought I'd miss the classic pixels more, but this new style is so confident and the characters so lively that I grew to dig it just as much. The art, puzzles and Thomas Regin's jazzy, bluesy score all contribute towards this being another feather in Wadjet Eye's cap, but I found myself even more smitten than usual this time, elevated as Old Skies is by the potency of the writing and the large cast's phenomenal performances. Gilbert's adventure games have never let me down in this regard, but this feels like a notable leap forward. The missions initially have an anthology-like vibe—each a discrete adventure set in a different era, but always in New York. They are intimate examinations of human nature, but equally stories about the changing face of the city that Gilbert has spent his career depicting. These aren't reallyourstories, though. Like Fia, we are observers and facilitators. At first, anyway. But Old Skies slowly grows into a cohesive story of love, loss and regret that started to punch me in the gut with alarming regularity. There were a few points where I simply had to stop playing for a wee bit to regain my composure. As Fia develops more agency, more personal connections, a desire to have a real life rather than just being stuck in the eye of the storm, surrounded by an ever-changing reality, Old Skies truly becomes something special. My heart shattered into a million tiny pieces as I listened to her recite her mantra, \"Focus on the job\", after she'd once again had a chance at a sliver of happiness mercilessly ripped away from her by another change in the timeline. Rather than devolving into melodrama, Sally Beaumont's understated performance is uncomfortably real—you can feel Fia's composure and experience as she tries to move on, but also her weariness, and the cracks snaking across the surface of the walls she's been maintaining for all these years. Her journey from composed workaholic to tragic hero chips away at all the sci-fi gizmos and macguffins until you've just got this incredibly heartfelt story. Too many time-hopping adventures—especially videogame ones—get lost in the high-stakes, sci-fi nonsense, but Old Skies is far more interested in familiar, evocative human stories, finding the root of what makes time travel such a gripping concept, and then keeping that at the heart of everything. It's beautiful, sad and one of my favourite adventure games. A new adventure game classic, and a bit of a tear-jerker. Fraser is the UK online editor and has actually met The Internet in person.

    "article_text": "Some of these classic constellations have changed a little bit. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Deciding on thebest birthsignfor your character inOblivion Remasteredcan be a little tricky. You've barely murdered a few rats and goblins, and yet you're already being asked to define what type of character you want to play in the game. Luckily, there are a few birthsigns that stand above the others. Whether you want a generally useful stat-boost, an ability that can save your skin once per day, or something specific to the style of character you want to play, be it warrior, mage, or sneaky archer. All that said, here are the best birthsign choices based on what you decide to play in Oblivion Remastered. While there are 13 birthsigns to choose from, there are a few that I recommend depending on what kind of character you want to make: While you could also take The Lord if you want a tankier character, The Warrior is a great, straightforward choice if you're planning to slog it out in melee and play a classic fighter. The extra endurance will improve your maximum health, making it a little easier to survive against tougher enemies early on, while the strength will benefit you when whacking them with your weapon. With a big stat boost to agility, luck, and speed right from the get-go, The Thief is a solid birthsign for those who want to play a sneakier, more agile character, but also those who simply want a useful early game stat boost. All three of these are helpful; agility impacts stamina, speed impacts…well, move speed, and luck has a small bonus effect on all other skills. Oblivion remastered changes: What's new and what's not?Oblivion console commands: Cheats new and oldOblivion lockpicks: Where and how to use themOblivion vampirism cure: Rid yourself of the afflictionOblivion thieves guild: How to join the crew If you're looking to play a mage, you could always just take The Mage birthsign which grants 50 increased Magicka with no downside, but personally I think The Atronach is better. It's got the biggest Magicka boost of all birthsigns at 150 points, and gives the added benefit of that 50% chance to absorb spells, which is a very strong defensive ability. Sure, your Magicka regeneration is halted, but you can deal with that through potions and Welkynd Stones, as well as by taking a high elf—the race with the highest base Magicka. Of all the birthsigns that grant active powers, such as The Tower, The Serpent, The Lover, and The Ritual, this one has gotten me out of so many sticky situations in the past. In a game where it's quite easy to find yourself out of your depth while exploring, especially early on, having on-demand invisibility to hightail it away from enemies is ridiculously useful. It's also good if you want an easy way to steal stuff. Another strong early one is The Ritual, which can force undead to flee, and grants 200 points of health recovery once per day.

    "title": "You don't need an Oblivion Remaster, you need Boblivion, the mod that makes Oblivion Bob",
    "article_text": "Bobbing for poisoned apples. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's Oblivion time, folks. No, not March 20—Oblivion's original release date. No, not one of those weekends where I wake up and stare at the ceiling for three hours, either. It's finally time for the much-anticipated and maddening The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remaster, which was leaked and rumoured for so long that it was starting todrive fans off the rails. But who cares? Well, me. I care. I was literally liveblogging about the remaster's release yesterday. But Ishouldn't. Because I don't really need Oblivion Remastered. What I need is Boblivion, a project I struggle to translate into words and yet translate into powerful feelings unconsciously. From visionary artist assman3000,Boblivionis a mod for OG Oblivion that \"changes literally every single thing in the base game to 'Bob' literally everything, well, 99% of everything.\" Although I'm slightly disconcerted by assman's narrative crumbling under zero external pressure, I'm still impressed/amused by the whole effort. It really does change all things to Bob. Main menu items? Bob. Pause menu items? Bob. Bar menu items? Wall to wall Bob, my friend. Every cheesewheel, every sword, every misaimed arrow: it's all Bob as far as the eye can see. Which is a very stupid joke in atradition of stupid jokesI can't help but admire. But what I really like about Boblivion is its willingness to commit to the bit to an invisible-yet-game-breaking degree. Our author delved into the Oblivion Creation Kit sufficiently to even rename all the game's races to, well, you know. \"This breaks dialogue though, because all races are now Bob. But you can still talk to people telepathically. Although all they have to say is 'Bob'.\" Which makes sense, given the nature of the project at hand. It's a dumb, throwaway gag that I have likely already dedicated more thought to than it strictly deserves, but here's some more thinking: I love this. Not because I think the joke is gut-bustingly hilarious, but because it's the kind of weird, baffling, meta outgrowth that comes when you leave a community to tinker with a game—right down to the fundamentals—for 19 years. It's like a plant that's been left in one pot too long: mutated and strange and kind of wonderful. It's the kind of thing I'm excited to see develop around this new, shinier Oblivion. Which means it's also the kind of thing that will keep OG Oblivion relevant even with its jazzed-up successor on the scene.

    "title": "Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 mime locations and how to beat them",
    "article_text": "Find the mimes scattered across the continent and work out how to damage them. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The continent inClair Obscur: Expedition 33is filled with Nevrons and mighty foes to take down. However, another more mysterious enemy you can battle are themimes. These strange, creepy, oversized robotic mimics seem almost untouchable initially, as your attacks, free aim shots, and skills won’t do anything against the indestructible wall they put up. You first have to\"break\" mimes to damage them, which means using a skill that deals break damage like Gustave's Overcharge. Once broken, you can deal damage normally and defeat them to claim the rewards. Here I'll run through all the mime locations I've found in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and what you get from each. You can find the first mime during the prologue section in Lumiere. As you reach the waterfront steps down to the harbor, look to your right to see some children performing on a stage. The mime is off to the right, collapsed on the ground in its own little area. This mime is only accessible during this prologue. If you've passed this moment and moved on to the expedition festival at nighttime, you cannot fight it or return to fight it later on. However, there is another way to get the Lumiere record from a different source later on, so fear not. In the Spring Meadows area, you'll eventually reach the Grand Meadow expedition flag as you and Lune push towards the Indigo Tree. Ignore the path to the right with the big hulking Nevron and take the left instead. Defeat the Nevron with the spear down this path, shaded by the rocks and cliffs, and grapple up to the platform ahead. Do the same to the next cliffside. Continue down this cliffside until you reach a circular platform with a mime. You can find this mime later on in the Flying Waters area that you visit early in the main story. From the Lumieran Streets expedition flag, backtrack through the level until you drop down a climable ledge, then turn right, taking a path through the seaweed to reveal another ledge with climbing holds. Hop up this to find the mime at the top. As you enter the Ancient Sanctuary area for the first time during the main story, the second rest point you visit is the Sanctuary Maze expedition flag. From this flag, stick to the right and head under the fallen tree branch. Then, take a right again and crawl under the gap in the rock. Follow the path along to the next open area with the broken wooden hut and in the back behind it, you'll spot this mime near a windmill. The next mime is in Esquie’s Nest, which you visit as part of the main story. Go past the Entrance expedition flag and down the central corridor. Once you reach the first open section of the cave, look down to your right to find the Mime. You can jump down from this pathway to the lower section to fight it. The next mime is in the optional Yellow Harvest area, which is to the east of the Gestral Village and Esquie’s Nest, by some yellow trees. From the Harvester’s Hollow expedition flag, head down the path to your right. When you reach the dead Nevron with the blue lamp in the middle of the field (another Nevron will be walking around it), look to your right to find a cave opening you can crawl into, with the mime inside. The next Mime is located in the optional Frozen Hearts location, which is in a region accessible via the back of Monoco's Station. You'll have to delve quite far into the area, until you get to the station on top of the hill that leads into the crater and find the Iced Heart expedition flag. From here, climb and grapple up the frozen train cars until you reach the level with the Gestral merchant. Look to your right to spot the mime sitting at the back by some pillars and boxes. You can find these two mimes in the overworld once you exit from Old Lumiere in act two. Head north-west to find a small island with red grass and trees, with two mimes at the centre of it. If you're still struggling to find the location, it's also south-west from the Visages area—the island with all the big masks—where you find one of the Axons. You can find this mime in the Visages location, where you'll head later in the story while hunting down one of the Axons during act two. While in the area, you'll have the option to fight the Axon or explore three optional side paths. The mime is on these paths, specifically the one directly to the left of the Plazza expedition flag (the happiness mask path). You'll know it's the right one because the grass will switch from red to green before you get the cutscene with the mask that teleports your party. From the Joy Vale expedition flag, head left past the leafy bodies entwined in branches, then turn right and take the path between the rocks, with the enemies on the left. Carry on, and you'll find the mime on a cliff edge hiding behind a tree. While exploring Sirene, where you'll also head later in the story while hunting down one of the Axons during act two, you'll eventually find yourself at the Sewing Atelier expedition flag rest point just before the Tisseur boss. From here, head right up the stairs towards the statue, then take another right into a dark room with the mime inside. This mime is located at the very end of act two once you find yourself inside the Paintress' monolith. Upon reaching the Tainted Cliffs expedition flag, continue along the main path, up the stairs and along the cliffs, until you reach two patrolling enemies with swords. Hug the left wall until you find the point where you can descend a rope into an arena with a mime and two enemies.

    "article_text": "Use the resin to show this strange Nevron light. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Helping theJarfind light is the first quest you'll encounter inClair Obscur: Expedition 33—in fact, it's unavoidable. While battling your way through the first Spring Meadows area, you'll encounter this strange monster on the main path and it'll trigger a cutscene. The Jar is unable to move without light, and the lamp he's carrying isn't lit. If you want to help him, you'll have to find a way to bring him light and set his lamppost glowing again. Since there are few reasons to return to this area, and the game doesn't have a quest log, it's easy to forget the Jar even exists. Still, if you get this done early, you'll get a nice little item bonus that'll help in all your future battles. To show the Jar light, you first need toacquire the resin quest item, which is also located in the Spring Meadows area. From where you find the Jar and the Expedition 81 rest point, you need to: If you haven't used free aim before, hold left trigger on controller to aim, and then press right trigger to fire—or hold right mouse button and click left mouse button. Now you can head back and give the resin to the Jar, who'll be pleased with your discovery. The monster will ask you to light his lamp now he's got some fuel, souse your free aim to target and shoot the top of the lamppost he's carrying. As a reward, you'll get a little tidbit of lore about the Paintress, but more importantly, a Healing Tint Shard that'll give you an extra healing item during battles. As with other Nevron quests, you can also choose to fight and kill the Jar once his quest is complete, for which you'll get three Colour of Lumina, one Chroma Catalyst, and an eternal sense of guilt for murdering this sweet boy.

    "article_text": "What to do with this strange item you won at the expedition festival. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. You probably found theweird pictosinClair Obscur: Expedition 33during the expedition festival by spending a token with Tom—it's a very unusual quest item that offers no clue what to do with it. However, considering you get them right before you set off for the continent, it's clear that you won't be using them in the city of Lumiere. That leaves you with a bit of a quandary; you've got the whole rest of the game to explore but no clear indication of what this item is used for. If you want to skip the finding out phase, here's where to use the weird pictos in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and what they'll get you. You won't be able to use the weird pictos in Expedition 33 until youreach the Gestral Village, even though you found them before even setting out. It's not that far away, but getting there will require a reasonable amount of story progression, successfully navigating the first few areas and beating multiple bosses. Once you arrive in the Gestral Village—don't worry, the story will literally guide you to this location—you'll want tohead into the bazaar on your left and look for the Gestral Merchantbehind the counter talking to a customer just by where you enter. This is Jujubree and he'll let you browse his wares once you speak to him. After you close the shop menu, he'll notice your weird pictos and ask to take a look at fixing them. For me, thisadded three levels to my Augmented Aim picto, taking it from level two to level five. I tried unequipping all my pictos to see if that made a difference, but it didn't. You might not have acquired Augmented Aim, so there's a chance that this upgrade might be applied to another picto in your collection. Either way, three levels is a big bump. I'm not sure if there are other weird pictos you can find in the game, but if you do, bring them back to Jujubree for even more free levels.

    "article_text": "Track down all the troublesome lost Gestrals and discover what rewards you get for returning them to Sastro. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There's a lot to do inClair Obscur: Expedition 33's open world that isn't immediately accessible, from secret areas to hidden endgame boss fights. One thing you can do, though, is hunt down somelost Gestrallocationsscattered across the map. You'll first have to reach Esquie's Nest in act one of the game's story, which is when you can meet Sastro—a Gestral wearing a chef's hat who hangs out in your camp. Each Gestral you find for Sastro unlocks a new reward you can claim from him if you return to camp (by pressing G or down on a controller in the overworld). If you're struggling to find the Gestral chef, head left at the entrance to the clearing with The Curator, then take another left into a small clearing, though, as mentioned, he won't appear until after you meet Esquie. It's also possible he doesn't appear until you find the first lost Gestral out front of Esquie's Nest. Here I'll detail each lost Gestral location in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, what reward you'll earn from Sastro, as well as whether you need an upgrade for Esquie to reach them. Since the rewards relate to the number of lost Gestral kids found, you can grab these in any order, provided you're able to access them. The first lost Gestral is hard to miss since it's standing directly in front of Esquie’s Nest when you visit in act one. You'll naturally enter Esquie’s Nest during the main story after visiting the Gestral Village, so unless you choose to walk on by, finding this one is a given. Once you speak to them, they will return to the camp, and Sastro will also appear. Sastro is located down the path to the left of the Curator’s cave. Take another left once you reach the pond, and he can be seen standing by a blue glowing tree. The second lost Gestral is located just to the east of the Stone Wave Cliffs, down the path to the right of the entrance. You'll need to defeat the Bourgeon and the enemies here to reach the Gestral, who is just off to your right after the Bourgeon. If you're struggling, there's no reason you can't also return to this location later, once you gain Esquie's ability to fly in act three, letting you bypass the enemy entirely—though you'll easily be strong enough to beat it before then. The third lost Gestral is on a small island by the White Tree area to the west of the Gestral Village—you'll need Esquie's swim ability you get at the end of act one to get here. Head west from the village to the Gestral Beach, swim across the gap, then swim north-west to find the White Tree island. You can find the lost Gestral in the portion with the seaweed-looking plants, standing in front of some vases. You can find the fourth lost Gestral in the area after The Forgotten Battlefield, just before Monoco's Station, which you visit in act two. From the station itself, head down the hill and hug the left side, keeping an eye out for a lost Gestral by a cluster of green trees, where the snow meets the grass, standing by some pots and broken crates. If you missed this during the story, you can return here by swimming back through the corals, using Esquie’s flying ability in act three, or by heading through Monoco’s Station, although this is the longest route back. The fifth lost Gestral is located on a beach just to the east of the previous one you found near Monoco Station. From the station entrance, find the beach to the east and swim through the coral north of it—if you don't have this ability for Esquie yet, you'll need to progress the story a little further. On the northern tip of the headland to your right, you'll find a small beach with some enemies and the lost Gestral. If you miss this one, you can use Esquie's coral-smashing ability to get back here from the act three region, coming from the north. You can find the sixth lost Gestral once you make it through Old Lumiere and start hunting the Axons. Just to the west of the exit from Old Lumiere, you'll find an island with red grass and trees, plus two mimes in the centre of it. You'll find the Gestral just behind the mimes at the rear of the island. The seventh lost Gestral is only accessible once you arrive in act three and acquire Esquie's ability to fly. Travel to the far north of the map, and search to the west of the Visages location, where you fought one of the Axons—it's the place covered in masks if you can't recall. Here you'll find a small strip of otherwise inaccessible land where you can put down with Esquie, just to the north of the giant wooden tower with the hot air balloons. The Gestral is in the southern section, by some destroyed trees. The eighth lost Gestral is another that is only obtainable once you're in act three and Esquie can fly. This one is located in the far east of the map—from Sirene, the colosseum where you found the second Axon—fly directly south-east, over the Gestral Beach on its own little island, until you spot a small red jungle. You'll know you're in the right place because this is where the Endless Night Sanctuary is located. Just below that area, you'll spot a group of enemies by a big bell, with the lost Gestral slightly to the north of them between some trees. The final Lost Gestral is on a small island high up next to the Endless Tower in the west of the map. It requires Esquie’s flying ability to reach, which you unlock during act three. Fly up, close to the skybox ceiling, and you can see a small island with the Gestral sitting on it. And with that, you've found all nine lost Gestrals for Sastro.

    "title": "10 tips to conquer the continent in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33",
    "article_text": "Battle deadly Nevrons and melt your brain trying to work out what the hell's going on. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Coming up with someClair Obscur: Expedition 33tipswas surprisingly challenging, and that's not because it's a simple game. There's so much to say about this French JRPG-style game that it's tough to know where to start. Many have dubbed it French Persona, but while there are certain similarities in systems and UI that any fan would instantly recognise, it's got a lot of its own tricks too. You'll find yourself dodging, parrying, and even jumping attacks in real time, almost like a rhythm game, for example. While the social systems may be sidelined in comparison to Persona, Expedition 33 is far more extensive in terms of overworld exploration, too, letting you discover secrets, puzzles, and optional bosses as you progress. Here are ten tips that'll help you tackle the continent and its many mysteries in Clair Obscur. More than most RPGs I've played, exploration feels massively important in Expedition 33. Taking your time to travel around the continent imparts lore and paints a picture of the prior expeditions and their struggle to take down the Paintress. It also provides powerful pictos, upgrade materials for weapons, healing items, and even outfits. Those who properly search every nook and cranny will get to experience optional bosses, quests, and super pretty areas they never would've encountered otherwise—so get out there and get exploring. Lumina is the most powerful combat mechanic in Expedition 33, but honestly, it's easy to forget it's there. While characters can only equip three pictos—which each provide a benefit—lumina points let you activate extra pictos as bonus effects. Once you complete the Flying Waters area and unlock the Curator in your camp, speak to him and select the \"Upgrade Expedition resources\" option. This will let you use any Colour of Lumina items you've found to add lumina points to members of your party, increasing their capacity for active buffs. To manage these, select a character in the menu, and cycle across to the right side where it says luminas to edit them. Though its combat is fairly complex, with a variety of buffs and debuffs, Expedition 33 features a straightforward elemental weakness system for enemies and bosses. Depending on the damage type, you might find that an enemy is weak, resistant, immune, or even healed by the element you're using, so it's worth paying attention to. Each weapon has a fixed element—you'll deal this damage type when you attack normally—but skills also deal specific elemental damage, so make sure to bring a range so you can cover your bases no matter the boss. This step is kind of unavoidable alas. If you find quicktime events annoying, Expedition 33 isn't for you, since you'll be dodging, jumping, and parrying in real time despite its turn-based battles. Each enemy or boss only has a few attacks, so it isn't particularly hard to nail down the timing—what's harder is responding appropriately to each onslaught. Some attacks require you to dodge, some require you to jump, some need a parry, and others necessitate a gradient counter, which you unlock later in the game. Thankfully, Expedition 33 is very good at slowly introducing each of these so you don't feel like your brain is melting. When you see that Gustave has the option to use a gun in combat, you'll probably be like, \"Hey, it's Joker's pistol from Persona 5!\" While this is fairly accurate, \"free aim\" as this turn-based gunplay is called, is actually a fully-fledged combat mechanic. You'll often find enemies with weak points you can shoot at which produce a variety of effects. If you shoot the mine that the aquatic Demineur enemy carries, for instance, it'll blow up and hurt other enemies. Some bosses even have shooting-based mechanics, where using your gun in a clever way will provide a bonus or stop them performing some horrendous attack that was about to one-shot your party. Lastly, remember that you can also use your gun to deal with annoying enemies that dodge all of your attacks. While we're on the subject of guns; use free aim to destroy shields. Frequently during battles, enemies and bosses will call on abilities that let them protect themselves, giving them a little shield icon above their health bar—this will ignore one instance of damage. Since there's no point wasting an actual attack removing these shields, use free aim and simply spend action points to shoot the enemy until their shields are gone, then you can deal proper damage with your turn. Easy! If you're playing Expedition 33 like a metroidvania, assuming you'll unlock everything just by following the main track of the game, think again. There are multiple traversal and exploration-based abilities that you'll only be able to unlock through optional activities, such as smashing those big blue rocks you see around the map, and diving underwater. It's just another reason to explore thoroughly and do some side stuff rather than just pursuing the main story. Though Expedition 33 doesn't feature relationship mechanics that are quite as complex as Persona, you do have a bond with each expedition member, and you can improve this by spending time with them in camp. Besides giving you some heartfelt interactions to enjoy, your relationship level will also unlock new character abilities, and in the case of Esquie, even some traversal abilities that help you explore the continent more. If you're unsure when to spend time with your companions, there's usually a new hangout event available whenever you're forced to revisit camp after an important story moment. If you're also interested in customising your party with cosmetics, then there are a few different ways to do it. You can complete quests, track down mimes, or the easiest option; find Gestral merchants. These vendors are dotted around the overworld and in various areas, and they'll straight up sell you upgrade materials, pictos, and most importantly, character cosmetics. The real barrier to dealing damage in Expedition 33 is having enough action points to actually use your most powerful abilities. Sure, you can get action points by just doing plain old attacks, but that's a mug's game and wastes a precious turn. Instead, use your pictos and lumina points to activate buffs that'll get you AP through other sources. Dodger, for example, gives you +1 AP per turn for a perfect dodge, Rewarding Mark gives +2 AP for hitting a marked target, Energising Break gives +3 AP for breaking an enemy, while Dead Energy gives +3 AP on killing a target. You can also earn AP by parrying. Later on, you can even find the Powered Action picto which consumes extra AP for 30% increased damage. Whatever happens, you'll want plenty of AP for your characters so they can use their best skills often. Each character in Expedition 33 has their own distinctive playstyle, whether it's Maelle's stances conferring buffs on her during combat, or Lune stockpiling stains as she casts magic to unleash even more powerful spells. Pictos and lumina, too, incentivise you to combine them in smart ways that'll provide extra buffs, damage, and just generally let you get pretty OP—you'll need it if you want to tackle tanky endgame bosses. The good news is that the game almost never forces you to play as specific characters, so you can pick and learn the ones you like. For maximum damage early on, I recommend you take Maelle no matter what because her Percée skill is a bit cracked, but any character can be decent with the right picto and lumina combos, so long as you learn and take the time to build them.

Tracking downthebluemushroomfor Karatom inClair Obscur: Expedition 33is a quest you can undertake once you arrive in the Gestral Village. This little Gestral inventor is trying to create the ultimate Sakapatate—you might remember fighting these patchwork sentinels a little while earlier in the Ancient Sanctuary. The problem is that Karatom needs more potent gunpowder that can only be refined from blue mushrooms. You'll have to locate this mushroom if you want to complete the quest and help birth his creation. One thing worth noting is thatthis quest becomes inaccessible after you complete the Stone Wave Cliffsarea as part of the main story, so make sure to finish it before then if you want the rewards. Now, here's where to get that mushroom. You canfind the mushroom in the Esquie's Nest area. You'll head here as part of the main story immediately after you visit the Gestral Village, but first you'll need to meet Golga, the village chief, and compete in the Gestral tournament to earn the password—this will allow you to get past the sentry standing guard at its entrance. Esquie's Nest is pretty easy to spot on the overworld map since it's effectively a small mountain wearing a mask relatively close to the village. Once inside Esquie's nest, to find the mushroom: Bring the mushroom back to Karatom in the Gestral Village and he'll be able to finish his Sakapatate. The bad news is that he needs someone to test it on. You'll have tofight the Ultimate Sakapatate boss as Gustave, but since it has the same attack patterns as the big Sakapatate you defeated in the Ancient Sanctuary, it shouldn't prove too much trouble. Just remember to build Gustave's Overcharge skill and use that to break it for extra damage. Beating it gets you three Chroma Catalysts and one Recoat. When Karatom thanks you, he'll also give you the extremely fancy Pure outfit for Gustave—a cool-looking white and gold version of the expeditioners' clothing.

    "article_text": "Answer all of Antoine's questions at the expedition festival and get a prize. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. While attending the pre-departure festival inClair Obscur: Expedition 33, you can takeAntoine's quiz—a test of knowledge to see if you've been paying attention in the city of Lumiere so far. If you answer all three of his questions, you'll get an additional festival token that you can spend in the three tents just behind him. These unlock two potential quest items—which you presumably can't access later considering you leave Lumiere—and an extra tied-back hairstyle for Gustave. Now you know what's at stake, here are the three answers you need to give to Antoine's questions. Since your expedition is number 33 and the previous expedition was 34, you know that it's counting down. The expeditions started in year 100 after the fracture, so that means you calculate 33 minus 100 to get the answer. Considering the previous question, you'd have thought expedition 100 would be the right answer to this, but for some reason the first one was called \"Expedition Zero\"—even Antonine is confused as to why this was the case. I'm honestly not sure how you're supposed to know this information considering Pictos aren't introduced as a mechanic until later on, but this is the correct answer nonetheless. Answer all three and, as mentioned, Antoine will give you a festival token to exchange in the stores at the back. If you're wondering where to get the third and final token—you already get one as you enter the festival—you'll need to beat Maelle in the duel she proposes. Since there are three stalls, you only need three tokens to get the old key and weird pictos quest items, as well as Gustave's new hairstyle.

Finding a use for theold keyinClair Obscur: Expedition 33is a bit unusual. Just like the weird pictos, you can acquire this mysterious quest item at the expedition festival before you leave Lumiere, but since you get it before you even arrive on the main game's map, it's impossible to know which door it's used to unlock. The description doesn't give much away either; it's simply an old key used to unlock an old door. While I'll point you in the right direction below, note first thatyou won't be able to use the old key until a fair way into act twoof the game, so you might want to return here later once you've progressed to that point. The old keyopens a gate in Old Lumierebut, as mentioned, you won't find yourself in this area until later in act two of the game, around 15 - 25 hours in, depending on how many extracurricular activities you get drawn into. You'll head to this area as part of the story and the door that the old key opens is hidden just off to the side of your main path through it. When you arrive in Old Lumiere, you'll soon find your party split into two groups. First, you'll play as Lune's group, and then as Maelle, and this is when you need to locate your locked door. From the Expedition 42 - Left Street rest point where Maelle starts: Behind this locked grating, you'll find the otherwise inaccessibleSurvivor log.

    "article_text": "Help the Demineur in the Flying Waters retrieve his beloved mine. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. InClair Obscur: Expedition 33, there are lots of mysterious creatures and enemies you come across on your journey. However, not all of them are hostile, and in the Flying Waters area early on in act one, you come across aDemineur missing its mine. While you can attack it, you can also help return its bomb to unlock an excellent early-game weapon. You can find the Demineur towards the end of the area, after the Noco’s Hut expedition flag. Instead of heading up to the left to progress, make your way to the back of the area and walk through the huge opening ahead—you'll find this white Demineur floating by itself. As mentioned, you can fight it straight away if you choose, butI'd recommend not attacking the Demineur, since you won't be able to complete the quest and you'll miss out on the rewards. All that said, here's where to find the bomb and what you'll get for your trouble. The Demineur’s bomb is located on a ledge just to the right of it in the same minefield area. Follow these steps: Picking this item up will give you theintact mineto hand back to Demineur. Return to it by jumping down from the ledge and heading back up the original path through the cave opening. Choose the “Hey, hold this” dialogue option to hand over the mine. In return, the Demineur will give you Lune’sDeminerimweapon, which deals lightning damage and scales with luck. It also has some great inherent skills like decreasing the AP cost of lightning skills when upgraded and boosting lightning skill damage by 20%. Once you've delivered the mine,you can also fight the Demineurif you choose. This Nevron attacks with lightning spells and ranged attacks that you can easily dodge, and as with the regular version, you can explode its mine using free aim. You'll get three Color of Lumina and one Chroma Catalyst if you defeat it, though it's worth noting that these are fairly common throughout the game, so you might not want to kill it. With this side quest completed, you can return to the main path and continue on your journey through the Flying Waters.

    "article_text": "It's just a trash can… right? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's just atrash can; you'll likely have seen this message inClair Obscur: Expedition 33during the intro in the city of Lumiere. After finding Sophie as Gustave, you can explore and examine to your heart's content, not limited to sticking your nose into the city's various trash receptacles. Every time you try to examine a bin, you'll get a message professing its innocence, but seasoned gamers know the truth: a trash can is neverjusta trash can. If you've already carried on to the expedition festival, then you might want to know the answers toAntoine's questionsinstead. Otherwise, here's how to unravel the mystery of the Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 trash can. After you meet Sophie as Gustave and start exploring the city of Lumiere, you'll find a number of trash cans you can interact with, but upon examining each, it'll either say \"It's just a trash can\" or \"A normal trash can\". Obviously, this is a straight-up lie. You can uncover the mystery of the trash can when you pass the main square and enter the area with the painter and the woman playing guitar on stage. Justbehind the painter and his blank canvas, you'll find a trash can with a slightly different message: \"A perfectly normal trash can\". Keep interacting with this new trash can for \"It is indeed a perfectly normal trash can\" and then \"Once again, a perfectly normal-\". At this point, Trash-can Man will interrupt (yes, that is genuinely his name) and tell you that he's hiding in there so the paintress won't find him—genius idea, pal. Keep talking to him and he'll explain there's something digging into him, before handing you a Chroma Catalyst for upgrading weapons as a reward. Congratulations; you've resolved the trash can mystery. Also, quick note: if you find yourself back in Lumiere, be sure to check this trash can again.

    "title": "How to deal 9,999 damage to Ono-Puncho in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33",
    "article_text": "Exploit Maelle’s powerful skills to deal max damage to this warrior in Gestral Village. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. InClair Obscur: Expedition 33, the Gestrals are an enigmatic and playful species that you'll find across the continent. During your journey through act one, you visit their home, Gestral Village, and can talk to a Gestral namedOno-Punchoin the back of the the arena. He challenges you to deal9,999 damagein just one hit. While that might seem like a huge challenge, it is possible to complete this during act one of the game thanks to Maelle’s Percée skill, plus some key pictos and lumina that boost her damage to marked enemies. Below, I'll break down exactly how to set up your party, plus Maelle’s skills and stats to deal 9,999 damage to Ono-Puncho without too much trouble. If you haven’t found Ono-Puncho yet, head to the Gestral Village arena where all the fighters are gathered. To the right of the two tall Gestral arena fans, you'll find an archway leading to a small path with Ono Puncho sitting in the corner. The trickiest part of dealing 9,999 damage to Ono-Puncho isn't hitting that number—you'll frequently hit that number in act two and three of the game. No, the challenge is getting there with little to no setup, since you can only hit Ono-Punch once. To deal 9,999 damage to Ono Puncho, I used the following build and setup with Sciel and Maelle. If you haven't recruited Sciel, you'll need to complete the main Gestral Village storyline. Otherwise, here's what to do: The core of this setup revolves around Maelle’s skills. The first is Last Chance, which allows you to sacrifice 99% of your health to enter Virtuoso stance and regain full AP. In this stance, Maelle does 200% damage, and since Ono-Puncho doesn’t attack, you won’t have to worry about her dying due to low HP. The second skill is Percée, which does a lot of damage and only costs 2 AP when in Virtuoso stance. Additionally, it does even more damage if the target is marked. Investing your points into Maelle's Might and Agility will give you more turns, ensuring you're set up to deal maximum damage with Percée. We'll also be using Sciel’s Fortune’s Fury skill to double that damage. Finally, equip the Marking Shots picto or lumina to give Maelle a 20% chance to mark the enemy she shoots in free aim. You can find this picto in the Flying Waters area, before you meet Maelle and visit The Manor: Additionally, you can equip Augmented First Strike to deal 50% more damage on Maelle's first hit of a fight, although this isn’t needed with all the extra damage buffs we are already getting from marking the target and Sciel. You can get the Augmented First Strike picto by defeating the Mime in Esquie’s Nest. Now that you're fully set up, it's time to take on Ono-Puncho. Follow these steps to defeat him: The only catch with this setup is that if you get unlucky and don’t mark Ono-Puncho by the time you hit 2 AP with Maelle, you need to restart the battle and repeat the steps—simply talk to him again to do so. It's also worth noting that a variety of different setups will let you beat Ono-Puncho. You'll realise later in the game, but 9,999 damage isn't actually that hard to reach once you've levelled up. Upon successfully dealing 9,999 damage to Ono-Puncho in one hit, you'll get the Sakapatate outfit for Maelle, and the quest will finish.

    "article_text": "This fountain in the Red Woods is hungry for your chroma. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Deciding whether to pay theodd fountaininClair Obscur: Expedition 33is a bit of a quandary. While exploring the initial areas of the continent, you may have encountered this mysterious pool in the Red Woods area, and upon closer examination, realised that you can chuck your hard-earned chroma into it—just like tossing a coin into a fountain. Chroma is pretty valuable considering you can use it to buy pictos, upgrade materials, cosmetics for your characters, and even weapons once you locate the right NPCs. The fountain, on the other hand, doesn't give you an indication of what you'll get for chucking your chroma in, and it'll ask for even more once you do. Here I'll explain your ultimate reward for feeding the fountain so you can decide whether it's worth it. As you give the odd fountain your chroma,it will ask for escalating amounts, providing a cryptic riddle each time you pay. However, you will get a proper reward at the end if you pay all of the necessary chroma and fill the fountain fully. I'll detail the cryptic messages below, along with the final reward you get when you reach the max amount: At this point, the fountain will come to life and hop out of the ground, revealing itself to be a fountain-headed Nevron known as Benisseur. He'll explain that he was hiding in the woods andhe'll give you the level 20 Recovery pictoas your reward. This picto restores 10% health on turn start, so it's pretty strong. So strong that it's worth paying 90,000 chroma? I'm not so sure. Then again, chroma is infinite considering you can get it from battles. If you want some extra rewards, just like other Nevron quests, you can choose to fight Benisseur. This is a slightly unusual boss battle where you have to dodge his bubble attacks until he dies of exhaustion. Beating him gets you one Recoat, three Colour of Lumina, and one Grandiose Chroma Catalyst. Honestly, it serves him right for scoffing all your chroma.

An accessory bundle, with the two wireless speakers, a carry case and two wireless microphones designed with karaoke in mind, is available for $999.99 / £499.99 ($667 / AU$1,042 directly converted). Both will be on sale atAmazonand Nebula in the US and Nebula in the UK. The headline of Anker's release of the X1 is that it is perfect for the outdoors day or night, its 3,500 ANSI lumens brightness putting it in the same category as the likes of theSamsungPremier 9 andEpsonQB100, both of which we classed as 'super-bright'. Although the X1 sounds like it will be super-bright, even the brightest andbest 4K projectorscan still struggle with outdoor daytime viewing, as the lumens required to project a decent image in brighter viewing conditions can be a real challenge. However, 3,500 ANSI lumens is indeed very bright, and with the added benefit of Dolby VisionHDR, the X1 could produce images bright enough for outdoor viewing. Admittedly, it's not a cheap projector, but compared with other portable projectors with similar specs, such as theJMGO N1S Ultra 4K, it's competitively priced for what it offers. With the display specs listed and the option for an audio upgrade, plus two wireless microphones for anyone who fancies a bit of karaoke after their movie night, the Nebula X1 really could be the ultimate portable and outdoor projector cinema package. I'll be keen to get my hands on it and see how it fares. James is the TV Hardware Staff Writer at TechRadar.

    "title": "Character.AI's newest feature can bring a picture to uncanny life",
    "article_text": "Like an even more eerie version of the portraits from the Harry Potter books When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Images may be worth a thousand words, but Character.AI doesn't see any reason that the image shouldn't speak those words itself. The company has a new tool called AvatarFX that turns still images into expressive, speaking, singing, gesturing video avatars. And not just photos of people, animals, paintings of mythical beasts, even an inanimate object can talk and express emotion when you include a voice sample and script. AvatarFX produces surprisingly convincing videos. Everything from lip-sync accuracy, nuanced head tilts, eyebrow raises, and even appropriately dramatic hand gestures is all there. In a world already swirling with AI-generated text, images, songs, and now entire podcasts, AvatarFX might sound like just another clever toy. But what makes it special is how smoothly it connects voice to visuals. You can feed it a portrait, a line of dialogue, and a tone, and Character.AI calls what comes out a performance, one capable of long-form videos too, not just a few seconds. That's thanks to the model's temporal consistency, a fancy way of saying the avatar doesn’t suddenly grow a third eyebrow between sentences or forget where its chin goes mid-monologue. The movement of the face, hands, and body syncs with what’s being said, and the final result looks, if not alive, then at least lively enough to star in a late-night infomercial or guest-host a podcast about space lizards. Your creativity is the only thing standing between you and an AI-generated soap opera starring the family fridge. You can see some examples in the demo below. Of course, the magical talking picture frame fantasy comes with its fair share of baggage. An AI tool that can generate lifelike videos raises some understandable concerns. Character.AI does seem to be taking those concerns seriously with a suite of built-in safety measures for AvatarFX. That includes a ban on generating content from images of minors or public figures. The tool also scrambles human-uploaded faces so they’re no longer exact likenesses, and all the scripts are checked for appropriateness. Should that not be enough, every video has a watermark to make it clear this isn’t real footage, just some impressively animated pixels. There’s also a strict one-strike policy for breaking the rules. AvatarFX is not without precedent. Tools like HeyGen, Synthesia, and Runway have also pushed the boundaries of AI video generation. But Character.AI’s entry into the space ups the ante by fusing expressive avatars with its signature chat personalities. These aren’t just talking heads; they’re characters with backstories, personalities, and the ability to remember what you said last time you talked. AvatarFX is currently in a test phase, with Character.AI+ subscribers likely to get first dibs once it rolls out. For now, you can join a waitlist and start dreaming about which of your friends’ selfies would make the best Shakespearean monologue delivery system.

    "title": "Inside Disney’s high-tech mission to protect the Great Lizard Cuckoo at Lookout Cay",
    "article_text": "Combining wildlife biology with modern technology When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. WhenDisney Cruise Lineopened its new island destination in the Bahamas – Disney Lookout Cay at Lighthouse Point – it wasn’t just a vacation spot for island visitors. Instead, in coordination with its Animals, Science, and Environment (ASE) team, the brand launched a major conservation project that combined wildlife biology with modern technology, including radio telemetry and 3D printing. While Disney Lookout Cay opened in June 2024, planning had been underway well before then, with the ASE Conservation team included from the start. A key decision was that Disney wouldn’t develop more than 16% of the land. “We were going to leave a lot of the critical habitat, such as forest habitat, intact for the animals that were already living there,” Lauren Puishys, a Conservation & Science Tech with Disney’s ASE team, explained. “We created an environmental impact analysis before any construction began,” Puishys said. That then turned into an Environmental Management plan, which was focused on learning about the bird population on the island and protecting them. This article is part of a series of sustainability-themed articles we're running to observeEarth Day 2025and promote more sustainable practices. Check out all of ourSustainability Week 2025content. The team identified key zones on the island that would remain untouched based on where birds were nesting, migrating, or foraging – all gathered through on-the-ground fieldwork. “You're collecting every bird you see, every bird you hear, and you're just writing this down to make observations about how many of these birds are in this region,” Puishys said. One species quickly emerged as important, though – the great lizard cuckoo. “They're noisy, they're really cool looking,” Puishys explained, calling them ‘incredibly smart.’ Now, to track a population, though, in terms of patterns when moving around the island and where they were choosing to nest, Puishys and team combined old with new. In this case, the team turned to the art of 3D printing to get close to the bird species in question, and then, through radio telemetry, mapped them on the island. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. “I need a very specific bird,” Puishys recalled telling her colleague, Jose Dominguez, a member of Disney’s ASE Behavioral Husbandry team. Though he’s 3D modeled a variety of enrichment items for Disney’s Animal Kingdom theme park, he didn’t necessarily have experience modeling birds, so he called on other expert teams at Disney that did. Disney has teams unsurprisingly well-versed in 3D modeling using CADs and tools like Blender. “They were like, ‘Oh, absolutely, I would love to work on this,’” explained Dominguez. They collaborated for months, refining the model through regular Zoom calls. “Lauren provided her input on if it was too big or it needs an extra toe, things like that,” said Dominguez. “Eventually, we got to our desired model shape, the great lizard cuckoo.” The model was printed in PLA, a plant-based plastic, which Dominguez said is what Disney routinely uses for deployments in “behavior-based enrichment.” The model was then coated with the same durable outdoor paint used across properties. More specifically, “an outdoors acrylic-based UV-resistant paint, and then with a protective clear coating on top. The outcome? A decoy bird coupled with audio recordings of real bird calls. It worked and was deployed. “We had it down there with the speaker underneath it, and we had two different types of calls on there,” Puishys said. “At one point, an actual great lizard cuckoo called back and forth to it… So it was actually trying to communicate with the model, which was incredible to see.” We have infrastructure around property on the rooftops of buildings and cell towers that's actually created to pick up that signal Finally, a bird approached the decoy, and Puishys was ready for it. “I was in the woods, out of sight from the cuckoo but in sight of the model, so I could see it myself. And then all I had to do was step out of the woods, and the bird was in the net.” From there, the team attached a solar-powered radio telemetry tag to track the bird. “So there's small solar panels on it with a little antenna, and that's giving off a radio frequency of 434 megahertz,” Puishys said. “We have infrastructure around property on the rooftops of buildings and cell towers that's actually created to pick up that signal, which has an associated identifying eight-digit number and letter code for that animal.” Thanks to the tag and the infrastructure installed around the island in an unintrusive manner, Puishys can now track bird movements from her desk in Florida. “We work pulling everything off of the cloud with an API key through the company, and we can just download it all to my desk using RStudio,” she said. “We’ve had it up now since pre-construction and now have over 35 million data points associated with this.” We’ve had it up now since pre-construction and now have over 35 million data points associated with this That data is captured through a highly structured array of nodes across the island, with about 25 of them being spaced around 400 meters apart. Further, the data is stored on those nodes, then sent to the sensor station, which processes it and is uploaded via a cellular network so that the team can access it from anywhere. That includes Puishys’s desk in Florida, and it’s the most data the ASE team has ever collected on a terrestrial species. For Puishys, the most exciting part isn’t just the success of the project – it’s how early they were brought in. “I honestly think our involvement as a Conservation team in the development of Disney Lookout Cay was our biggest leap,” Puishys said. “It kind of blew me away… and it was a big part about why I was so happy to join the team and help out with the project.” The hope is that this approach – one that blends science, tech, and collaboration – becomes a template for future projects. “We hope that it worked out well enough that we can kind of be an example or a good model for other construction projects moving forward,” Puishys said.

    "title": "Microsoft teams up with Western Digital to extract rare earth oxides from decommissioned datacenter hard drives",
    "article_text": "Project recycles 50,000 pounds of HDDs into reusable high-purity materials When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A new pilot program fromMicrosoftand Western Digital has demonstrated a novel method of recycling rare earth elements (REEs) from decommissionedhard disk drives. The initiative, developed in collaboration with Critical Materials Recycling (CMR) and PedalPoint Recycling, successfully recovered nearly 90% of rare earth oxides and around 80% of the total feedstock mass from end-of-life drives and related components. Using materials sourced from Microsoft’s U.S.-baseddata centers, the project processed approximately 50,000 pounds of shredded HDDs and mountings, converting them into high-purity elemental materials. These can now be reused across key sectors such as electric vehicles, wind energy, and advanced computing. The project employs an acid-free, environmentally friendly recycling process that reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 95% compared to conventional mining and refining. This approach not only recovers rare earths like neodymium, praseodymium, and dysprosium, which are essential for HDD magnetic systems, but also extracts valuable metals including copper, aluminum, steel, and gold, feeding them back into the U.S. supply chain. It shows that evenexternal hard drivescan have an eco-friendly second life. Despite the critical role of rare earths in cloud infrastructure, current domestic recycling efforts in the U.S. recover less than 10% of these materials. Meanwhile, over 85% of global REE production remains concentrated overseas, but this pilot aims to change that, offering a scalable, domestic solution that reduces landfill waste, enhances supply chain resilience, and lowers dependence on foreign sources. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! “This is a tremendous effort by all parties involved. This pilot program has shown that sustainable and economically viable end-of-life (EOL) management for HDDs is achievable,” said Chuck Graham, corporate VP of cloud sourcing, supply chain, sustainability, and security at Microsoft. Acid-free dissolution recycling (ADR), a technology developed at the Critical Materials Innovation (CMI) Hub, was central to this achievement. “This project is significant because HDD feedstock will continue to grow globally as AI continues to drive the demand for HDD data storage,” said Tom Lograsso, director of CMI.

    "title": "YouTube's 20th Anniversary:  I hope you know, you are the way you are because of YouTube",
    "article_text": "The YouTube generation When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I remember life beforeYouTubeand life after. In the 20 years since Jawid Karim postedthat first zoo video, YouTube has become a dominant force in media creation and consumption. It's built industries and stars and forever altered viewing habits. I'd argue that it's the reason we now get most of our information from social video. And whileAIis fast becoming the source for every answer (and some videos), we still get things done with YouTube's voluminous guidance. As a long-time technology journalist, I'm embarrassed to admit I was a little late to the YouTube revolution, waiting to post my first video until almost 18 months after the initial launch. Even so, that first video made me a convert. I was so excited, Idetailed the entire process in a PCMag post. The video is in some ways emblematic of 2006's state-of-the-art. It's a silent, grainy 800-x-600 pumpkin carving animation. In hindsight, \"Ghost Carves Halloween Pumpkin\" looks awful, and yet, it set the template for a long and fruitful relationship, which even then featured many of the elements YouTube Pros rely on today. There's the pithy and key title, an accurate, if brief description, thumbs up marks (miraculously, no one gave me a thumbs down), and dozens of comments, including many that noticed my less-than-expert animation work. In those early days, it wasn't entirely clear what YouTube was meant for. Even the crew that launched it, Chad Hurley, Karim, and Steven Chen, could not agree on where the idea came from. At the time, Karim toldUSA Todaythat they wanted to build a platform where people could quickly discover highly publicized (trending) stories online. Others recall that the desire was a place where people could share videos of important life events. In a way, early YouTube is a reflection of all those intentions. Certainly,my own YouTube library, which is around 260 videos, is proof of that. It took me years to try my hand at becoming an official \"YouTuber\" but only after I learned the craft by watching thousands of other people's pro-level creations. There were, however, some who quickly recognized YouTube's storytelling potential. The breakthrough hit \"Lonelygirl15\" used YouTube's early confessional style to tell a complex story that, for a time, many people believed was real. The story ran on YouTube for a few years, but it was soon just one of many tales and, as I see it, lost among an explosion of YouTube talent that started using the platform as a way to convey lengthy monologues and details about their interests in science, technology, entertainment, DIY, and more. YouTube was the first media platform to lower the bar between filmed content and an audience. You no longer needed a TV network or film producer to greenlight your idea. If you could film and edit it, you could attract an audience. When my 46-second Pumpkin animation was unexpectedly featured on YouTube's homepage, my views exploded. The short video soon boasted well over 200,000 plays. I spent years trying to recreate that success, but that was another early lesson of YouTube: virality is not promised. It tickles me when TikTokkers moan about how the algorithm has abandoned them as if every video is supposed to hit 2 million views. YouTubers know all too well the vagaries of a platform and editors (then) and algorithms (now). YouTube made stars of people like Justin Bieber and Shawn Mendes (don't let people tell you that it was all Vine). YouTubers likeMKBHDandiJustinehave built and held onto enviably devoted audiences that I think most network television shows would kill for. (If you want to have some fun, visit any of these YouTubers' pages, go to the video tab, and click on the \"Oldest\" link to see their first YouTube videos.) In the meantime, YouTube altered our viewing habits and may have helped smooth the way for streaming platforms likeNetflix, which launched its streaming platform two years after YouTube. Watching high-quality videos online was quickly becoming an ingrained habit when Netflix first dumpedLilyhammeron us, but thankfully, it followed withHouse of Cards. Over time, YouTube transformed from a place for sharing short, interesting videos to long-form, lean-back experiences. Today, it's stuffed with video podcasts, hour-long videos that couldn't survive on TikTok. The transition from virality to information happened years ago, though. 2025's YouTube is as much about information as it is about entertainment. Parent companyGooglecertainly assisted in this. How many times have you Googled how to do something and found a YouTube video that shows you exactly how it's done? I'm not sure how I accomplish any unfamiliar tasks without YouTube's steady tutelage. With it, I've done everything fromjump-starting my carto installing a bathroom fan, all under the confident guidance of a YouTube video. YouTube's knowledge base across a wide range of topics is truly encyclopedic. I challenge you to find a topic that doesn't have a dozen or more video tutorials. In truth, the world learns differently because of YouTube. A2022 Pew Research studyfound that 95% of teens use YouTube. TikTok was close behind, and by now, it may be neck and neck. Still, learning from video and using it as your foundational source for news and forming opinions is all YouTube's doing. I understand that people still watch cable news and form opinions based on specific information bubbles, but online video wasn't a primary news source until YouTube came along. And it's not just young people.Statista foundthat people across all age ranges are watching videos, and the next generation will too, as 80% of parents said their under-11-year-olds are also watching YouTube. I've seen these kids in their strollers, iPad in hand, staring intently at the latestMs. Rachel video. And with YouTube entering its third decade, we are now living among adults who literally grew up with the platform. They've never known a world without YouTube, and their expectations for content are largely shaped by what they found there. My point is, we made YouTube, and then YouTube made us.

    "title": "ChatGPT news just got a major upgrade from The Washington Post",
    "article_text": "But don't expect any AI Pulitzers just yet When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Washington Posthas inked a deal withOpenAIto make its journalism available directly insideChatGPT. That means, the next time you ask ChatGPT something like “What’s going on with the Supreme Court this week?” or “How is the housing market today?” you might get an answer including aPostarticle summary, a relevant quote, and a clickable link to the full article. For the companies, the pairing makes plenty of sense. Award-winning journalism, plus an AI tool used by more than 500 million people a week, has obvious appeal. An information pipeline that lives somewhere between a search engine, a news app, and a research assistant entices fans of either or both products. And the two companies insist their goal is to make factual, high-quality reporting more accessible in the age of conversational AI. This partnership will shift ChatGPT’s answers to news-related queries so that relevant coverage fromThe Postwill be a likely addition, complete with attribution and context. So when something major happens in Congress, or a new international conflict breaks out, users will be routed to The Post’s trusted reporting. In an ideal world, that would cut down on the speculation, paraphrased half-truths, and straight-up misinformation that sneaks into AI-generated responses. This isn’t OpenAI’s first media rodeo. The company has already partnered with over 20 news publishers, includingThe Associated Press, Le Monde, The Guardian,andAxel Springer. These partnerships all have a similar shape: OpenAI licenses content so its models can generate responses that include accurate summaries and link back to source journalism, while also sharing some revenue with publishers. For OpenAI, partnering with news organizations is more than just PR polish. It’s a practical step toward ensuring that the future of AI doesn’t just echo back what Reddit and Wikipedia had to say in 2021. Instead, it actively integrates ongoing, up-to-date journalism into how it responds to real-world questions. The Washington Posthas its own ambitions around AI. The company has already tested ideas like its\"Ask The Post AI\"chatbotfor answering questions using the newspaper's content. There's alsotheClimate Answerschatbot, which the publication released specifically to answer questions and share information based on the newspaper's climate journalism. Internally, the newsroom has been building tools like Haystacker, which helps journalists sift through massive datasets and find story leads buried in the numbers. Starry-eyed idealism is nice, but there are some open questions. For instance, will the journalists who worked hard to report and write these stories be compensated for having their work embedded in ChatGPT? Sure, there's a link to their story, but that doesn't count as a view or help lead a reader to other pieces by the author or their colleagues. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. From a broader perspective, won't making ChatGPT a layer between the reader and the newspaper simply continue the undermining of subscription and revenue necessary to keep a media company afloat? Whether this is a mutually supportive arrangement or just AI absorbing the best of a lot of people's hard work while discarding the actual people remains to be seen. Making ChatGPT more reliable withThe Washington Postis a good idea, but we'll have to check future headlines to see if the AI benefits the newspaper.

    "title": "YouTube is giving its TV app a much-needed redesign soon – here’s what it looks like",
    "article_text": "The YouTube experience on TVs is about to get a lot better When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Twenty years ago today, the first video was uploaded toYouTube(the thrilling'Me at the zoo'). To celebrate that milestone, Google has announced that YouTube's TV app experience is going to get a big upgrade soon. And as someone who watches a lot of big-screen YouTube, that's something I'm very much looking forward to. Googlehasn't revealed a lot about the \"TV viewing upgrade\" it has planned. It's apparently coming \"this summer\" (which means sometime between June and September, if you're in the southern hemisphere). But it has revealed a screenshot (below) of what it'll look like, plus a few hints of what's coming. Apparently, we're going to get \"easier navigation\" alongside some \"quality tweaks\" and an improved playback experience. There will also be \"streamlined access to comments, channel info, and subscribing\". In other words, YouTube on your TV (not to be confused with YouTube TV) is going to become a lot more like the fully-featured browser experience. Alongside the improved TV experience, YouTube TV subscribers will also gain the ability to build their own multiview experience. This four-way grid has traditionally been reserved for sports fans, but this is being opened up to non-sports content with a \"small group of popular channels\" in the \"coming months\". So if you aren't feeling quite distracted enough yet, this multiview update could be for you. I've been watching YouTube on TV for years and it's always felt a few steps behind the full experience. TheAppleTV app, for example, was only given a comments section relatively recently – and while that might sound like a mixed blessing, I've always found comments to be an important part of the experience for the channels I follow. The incoming YouTube update for TVs appears to be more about design than functionality, but still looks a lot more modern and in tune with its mobile apps. There's a new button for adding the video to your playlists and it also appears to be easier to subscribe from within videos. There are no doubt more tweaks not shown in the single teaser image. YouTube is naturally reserving lots of features for Premium subscribers, too. As part of its 20th birthday announcements today, Google also revealed that a '4x playback speed' option is coming to smartphones for Premium subscribers (a service that costs $13.99 / £11.99 / AU$14.99 per month). Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

    "title": "Roku's new wireless security cameras will guard your home for up to two years on a single charge",
    "article_text": "... or even longer with a solar panel When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Streaming specialistRokuhas launched a pair of new wireless security cameras that can send video footage straight to your phone or TV, letting you watch your yard without leaving the couch. The Roku Battery Camera can run for up to six months on a single charge, while the Battery Camera Plus runs up to two years. Both cameras are weather-resistant, and can be set up indoors or out in a few seconds. You can use the Roku Smart Home app or Roku Web View to customize your camera's settings, set up schedules, and receive notifications. The cameras can also be used as motion-detectors to activate some of thebest smart lightsor other connected devices. Real-world battery life will depend on which settings you choose and the weather (lithium-ion batteries tend to drain faster in cold conditions), but the Battery Camera Plus should be a serious rival to theBlink Outdoor 4,which also runs for up to two years before it needs recharging. Both the Blink Outdoor 4 and Roku Battery Camera Plus boast 1080p resolution with motion detection and notifications, but the Roku camera also offers color night vision rather than black and white, which could give it the edge over the Blink model if the price is right. You could also extend the Roku cameras' battery life even further by connecting an optional solar panel – something that's not possible with the Blink camera. Roku has yet to announce official pricing for the two cameras, but it says they will be available \"in the coming months\". We're hoping to test both ourselves so we can see whether they deserve a place in our roundup of thebest home security camerasto secure your smart home.

    "title": "'A beautiful realization': Andor season 2 stars tease what Star Wars fans can expect from 'really bold' yet 'very strange' Syril and Dedra romance",
    "article_text": "Exclusive: 'It baffles me and I still can't fully work it out' When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Full spoilers immediately follow forAndorseason 2 episodes 1 to 3. Andorseason 2will take some very bold swings with the incredibly weird romantic relationship that develops between Syril Karn and Dedra Meero. That's according to Kyle Soller and Denise Gough, who told TechRadar that they're still struggling to truly \"work out\" what's going on between their characters one year on after filming wrapped on theStar Warsshow's latest season. They aren't the only ones. Ever since Syril saving Dedra's life inAndor's season 1 finale – a moment that was infused with a strange romantic tension – fans have longed to learn if the pair would actually get together. Now that season 2's first three episodes are not only out, but also confirm they're involved in some form of romantic entanglement, viewers are equally fascinated by the dynamic that's played out thus far. Indeed, threads on numerous Star Wars-based Reddit pages are filled with fans commenting on the curious atmosphere that arises whenever the Imperial officers are in the same room. Other social media platform are similarly awash with people trying to dissect the clearly uncomfortable nature of their dynamic. Fan examination of the romance between two members ofAndorseason 2's castis sure to continue for weeks and months to come, too. Well, as long as some of them remain as fascinated by the relationship as Soller and Gough continue to be – the duo telling me they're still not sure what's actually going on between their characters in one of thebest Disney+ shows' second and final season. \"I think it was really bold of [showrunner] Tony [Gilroy] to end season one with the two of them in this strange little cupboard [where they hide from the Ferrix rebellion],\" Soller mused. \"Now, going into the domestic intimacy of it all, and what that might look like for these two very strange animals, I think it's another masterstroke.\" Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. My biggest fear was 'Oh, great, they fall in love and then what?' \"But he [Tony] doesn't change them,\" Gough interjected. \"Going into this season, my biggest fear was 'Oh, great, they fall in love and then what? What does domestication look like to them?'. But, once I got the scripts for season two, I was like 'Okay, it still looks weird and it's even more surreal than before.'\" There was plenty for audiences to enjoy regarding the pair's relationship in one of 2025'snew Star Wars TV showsthroughout its first three chapters, too. Whether it was the extremely uncomfortable nature of Dedra meeting Syril's overbearing mom Eedy in episode 3, or the general conversations that they engage in, it seems fans are smitten with this villainous duo enjoying some frivolity amid the evil nature of their day-to-day jobs as employees of the Galactic Empire. So, will the good times last? Predictably, Gough and Soller wouldn't be drawn on how this dynamic will evolve over the next nine episodes. That said, they drop a couple of teases that viewers are sure to pore over during the wait for new episodes to air on one of thebest streaming servicesevery Tuesday (US) and Wednesday (UK and Australia). \"Relationships are all about power in one way or another,\" Soller said. \"This is a beautiful realization of how that power imbalance can grow and take things in all kinds of directions. I always thought Syril wants Dedra, but I also think he wants to use her, so it's hard to get a read on where his motives truly lie.\" The last thing I was expecting from #Andor S2 was a Syril and Dedra home life sitcom but I absolutely loved every second of it.Also, absolute mood: pic.twitter.com/Q5TRbjODtAApril 23, 2025 \"At her core, Dedra is a monster,\" Gough added. \"She does awful things based on where she's come from. \"Does she really care for Syril? I watch it as a viewer and I still don't know,\" Gough continued. \"To me, she doesn't have that human programming inside her to make me think that she's in love with him. She's like a computer, but I also think that she definitely wants him. It's not a loving relationship where they turn down the lights and cuddle. It feels very transactional and strange. It baffles me and I still can't fully work it out.\" My fullreview ofAndorseason 2doesn't contain any spoilers about where Syril and Dedra's relationship goes next.

    "title": "Western Digital plans to launch 40TB HDD next year using HAMR technology and a pinch of flash memory",
    "article_text": "WD says AI-driven storage demand will spike in late 2026 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Western Digital recentlyheld an investor day, with a primary focus on how it intends to supercharge hard drive capacity within a decade. WD’s detailed roadmap showed a clear technological evolution from energy-assisted Perpendicular Magnetic Recording (ePMR) to Heat-Assisted Magnetic Recording (HAMR), and ultimately to Heat Dot Magnetic Recording (HDMR), at which point it will be targeting capacities in excess of 100TB. By 2026, WD said its HDD capacity will reach 36TB-44TB thanks to HAMR technology which uses laser heating to temporarily lower the magnetic resistance (coercivity) of the disk, allowing for significantly denser data writing. In a recent interview withPC Watch, Kimihiko Nishio, sales manager for Western Digital Japan, went into further details on the company’s plans. “Other companies have started adopting HAMR with 30TB HDDs, but we believe HAMR’s true potential begins at 40TB,\" Nishio said. \"Until then, we'll continue using technologies like OptiNAND and UltraSMR to increase the capacity of existing HDDs up to 40TB.” OptiNAND, integrates flash memory with HDDs to boost capacity, performance, and reliability, while UltraSMR, uses advanced error correction to pack data tracks more densely than traditional SMR. “We’re targeting the latter half of 2026 for the release of 40TB drives,” Nishio said, adding that WD is \"currently developing HAMR with that goal in mind.” He explained that while data generation is booming, particularly due to AI advancements, storage demand is still catching up. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! “Right now, there's a huge surge in demand for generative AI, but storage hasn't really benefited from it yet. Currently, the biggest beneficiaries are GPU servers. First, data is being generated in large volumes, and after that, it will need to be stored. That’s where we expect storage demand to spike.” Western Digital is timing its production plans to coincide with this predicted demand. “We anticipate that spike will happen in the second half of 2026, which is why we're aligning our HAMR-based high-capacity HDD development to that timeframe,” Nishio said. “Since HAMR production requires a complete overhaul of materials, starting production now while demand is still low (e.g., for 40TB drives) would result in high costs. But we expect that in 2–3 years, demand will rise, allowing us to offer them at reasonable prices.” Nishio also shared Western Digital’s even more ambitious long-term vision. “Looking further ahead, we plan to release 100TB drives by 2030, after which we’ll pursue even greater capacities using new technologies,” he said.

You can always count onMaxfor a show-stopping drama, but you never know when it could get rid of that one movie you've been relying on it for. Luckily, that's what we're here for, and you can bet that we've had our eagle eyes peeled for the titles leaving Max soon. There are five stand-outs that have limited time left on one of thebest streaming servicesand now is the time to make the most of them. With two A24 movies on the chopping block (one of them a previous Best Picture Oscar winner), there's a beloved superhero movie, a British modern classic animated feature, and historical war biopic that Max have decided to let go. Thankfully none of our picks for thebest Max moviesare leaving any time soon - but that's never guaranteed. On a brighter note, Max has a wave of new movies and shows on the way, and you can view our full list ofeverything new on Max in May 2025. RT score:94%Directors:Dan Kwan & Daniel ScheinertAge rating:RLength:132 minutes One of the most-loved movies to come from the A24 studio that captured the hearts of millions of movie fans, and now it's running its course with Max. Though many were left utterly disappointed with Jamie Lee Curtis' Oscar victory over fellow nominee Stephanie Hsu, it certainly redeemed itself when it swept Best Supporting Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Best Picture. In this surrealist comedy action drama Michelle Yeoh stars as Evelyn Wang, a Chinese immigrant who is under IRS investigation. She uncovers a strange ability to transport through different universes and connect with her alternative timelines. Through this crazy journey across the multiverse she must stop a powerful being from destroying everything, but this wild ride turns into a touching story of self-discovery which leads her to rekindling her complicated relationship with her daughter. RT score:90%Director:Morten TyldumAge rating:PG-13Length:113 minutes Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. When I started my monthly streaming diary roundups earlier this year,The Imitation Gamewas one of thenine movies I streamed in January 2025. As far as biopics go, Tyldum's retelling of Alan Turing's history-altering discovery is a gold standard British drama film despite its small handful of historical inaccuracies. As much as its a war drama,The Imitation Gameis an inspiring story of a queer genius who helped saved millions, but was still persecuted for his sexuality even in the events after his ground-breaking achievement. It's the Second World War, and English mathematician Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) has been recruited by MI6 to help crack the Enigma Nazi code which professionals have failed time again to achieve. Behind him is a team of computer whizzes Hugh Alexander (Matthew Goode) and Joan Clarke (Kiera Knightley), who assist Turing in building a machine which he hopes will be the answer to saving the country from war. RT score:96%Director:Sean BakerAge rating:RLength:111 minutes If you loved recent Best Picture winnerAnora(2024) you only have a few more weeks left to revisit this coming-of-age drama from the back catalog of Sean Baker. Before he dabbled in comedy crime dramas, Baker put out his slice of life drama starring Willem Dafoe exploring the small joys in life and the means of creating your own fun and happiness with what you have. Six year-old girl Moonee (Brooklynn Prince) lives with her single mother at a motel in Florida who struggles to make ends meet and dips in and out of homelessness. Their world is a stark contrast from the one which surrounds them - the surreal and built-for-distraction Walt Disney World. RT score:96%Director:Paul KingAge rating:PGLength:95 minutes ThePaddingtonseries of movies has sat very well with audiences, with its recent installmentPaddington in Peru(2024) scoring 93% on Rotten Tomatoes. But its second moviePaddington 2(2018) comes out on top with a near-perfect score of 99%. Inspired by the classic British children's literature Paddington Bear (Ben Whishaw) lands himself in London after his Peru home is destroyed by an earthquake. He immediately warms to the family of Henry Brown (Hugh Bonneville) and Mary Brown (Sally Hawkins) and their two children, who decide to adapt him into the family, but shortly after settling into city life, he becomes the target of Millicent Clyde (Nicole Kidman), a taxidermist who will stop at nothing to get her hands on a bear as rare as he. RT score:85%Director:Tim MillerAge rating:RLength:108 minutes Miller made his directorial debut withDeadpoolin 2016 and went on to produce theSonictrilogy of movies (we won't mentionBorderlands). In contrast to otherMarvelmovies and superheroes, Deadpool isn't the suave, put-together action hero you'd expect. Instead, he's irreverent and unserious, yet has smart comedic timing. After serving in the Special Forces Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) is disfigured by evil scientist Ajax (Ed Skrein) and is turned into Deadpool. In spite of his disfigurement he's left with superhuman powers which he uses to his advantage to track down the man who ruined everything for him.

    "title": "MG and Zeekr show us the future of electric SUVs – and it includes the return of pop-up headlights",
    "article_text": "Zeekr goes for the cut-price Cullinan approach When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Both MG and Zeekr have joined a plethora of Chinese brands in showcasing exciting new models at this year’s Shanghai Motor Show. Sitting at the more affordable end of the spectrum, MG unveiled the second in its fashion-forward ‘Cyber’ themed series, which includes the ground-breaking two seaterCyberstersports car. While much of the current global MG range is stylish but a little restrained, the Cyber X is a full-on design showcase, boasting boxy proportions, a high-riding road presence and cool pop-up headlights that retract when the ignition is turned off. Sporting a stealthy smoked black paint job, it is the work of ex-VW and Bugatti Veyron designer Jozef Kaban, who joined MG early last year to bring some design spice to the brand. Speaking toAutocar, he said that the point of the Cyber X was to show how diverse the company is. Just around the corner from MG’s stand, Zeekr showcased its first every hybrid model in the gargantuan 9X – a car that the company hopes can legitimately take on the Rolls-Royce Cullinan and Bentley Bentayga in the ultra-luxury SUV space. But unlike the Rolls-Royce Cullinan, which costs well in excess of $400,000 (or £300,000 / AU$625,000) the 9X is slated to start at around $70,000 (about £53,000 / AU$110,000) and offer plenty in terms of intentions plushness and technology. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. There’s a 43-inch cinema screen in the rear, allowing passengers to recline in plush surroundings, while Zeekr says it will be the first model to sport its G-Pilot autonomous driving technology. According to the marque, its extensive camera, sensor and Lidar suite is good for true Level 3 autonomy – allowing drivers to take hands off the wheel and eyes off the road where legal to do so. Recent reports have suggested that the demand for premium Western brands is cooling in China, as the domestic market looks more towards its own start-ups for the latest and most innovative electric vehicle technology. Sales of Porsche and Ferrari vehicles have dipped in recent years, while even the luxury watch, wines and spirits markets have seen an overall decrease in sales numbers, according toFinews. This could be down to several factors, butJing Daily, which covers China’s luxury market, claims that there has been a general societal shift away from showy signs of wealth, while younger buyers expect a much higher level of digital engagement in their products. It is the reason that Audi has launched its own China-only brand in the confusingly-badged AUDI and Mercedes-Benz is showcasing its futuristic Vision V MPV concept at the Shanghai Motor show this year – not only is China producing some of the most advanced EVs on the planet, it is also exclusively receiving some of the newest and most innovative models from western brands. But both Zeekr and MG sell far beyond their domestic markets, with the pair rapidly finding an audience in Europe and beyond. While it is unlikely the rest of the world will get to see the mammoth 9X on the roads any time soon, the MG Cyber X is highly likely to spawn a global production variant. The Cyberster did a great job of establishing the brand as something more than just a budget offering, but the Cyber X could well be a volume seller that proves MG can also do desirable design. Leon has been navigating a world where automotive and tech collide for almost 20 years, reporting on everything from in-car entertainment to robotised manufacturing plants. Currently, EVs are the focus of his attentions, but give it a few years and it will be electric vertical take-off and landing craft. Outside of work hours, he can be found tinkering with distinctly analogue motorcycles, because electric motors are no replacement for an old Honda inline four.

Earlier this month we reported on rumors that suggestedGoogle Messages would be getting a snooze featureso you can temporarily turn off group chat notifications, and now it looks even more likely that this feature is on the way. That’s according to a newAndroid Authority teardownof the latestGoogleMessages build, in which the AA team actually managed to get the tool to work – suggesting it’s very close to release. The snooze feature will see a new button added to the toolbar (which appears at the top of the screen when you long-press on a chat). Choosing snooze will cause a second menu to appear, where you can choose to mute a group chain for one hour, eight hours, 24 hours, or 'always'. The menu also reveals that “other members will not see that you snoozed this chat.” You can also tweak your snooze options within user profiles, with this option giving you the ability to fine-tune notifications – such as muting everything except direct @ mentions in the chat. Muting can be an invaluable group chat function. Sometimes you just need to focus on something for a few hours and don’t want your phone to be bombarded with notifications. And we’ve all been in the family group chat which might be just a few very active relatives pinging messages back and forth – it would feel rude to leave, but only about 5% of the messages are relevant to you (and if a message is relevant the sender can always @ you). Muting allows you to remove some distractions from your life without completely shutting yourself off socially. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. As with all leaked features, there’s no guarantee that this will launch; however, given how in-depth the muting feature already appears to be, it seems likely that it’s not only on the way, but on the way soon.

    "article_text": "Pro Series, make way for the Plus Series When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Today, streaming stick and smart TV makerRokuannounced a range of enhancements for its currentRoku ProandRoku PlusSeries models, as well as a new 85-inch screen size option for its entry-level Select Series TVs. The Roku Pro series, the budget choice in ourbest TVsguide, will now get custom factory calibration, a process designed to ensure that “every TV delivers a stunning picture right out of the box.” The most significant announced changes are for the mid-range Roku Plus Series TVs, which now feature mini-LED backlighting. Combined with the TV’s QLED display panel, this should bring the brightness and color benefits of the Pro Series to a much cheaper price point. Plus Series TVs will also get Roku Smart Picture Max, a feature that performs picture adjustments on a scene-by-scene basis, so you don’t have to fuss with picture settings. Roku's Plus Series TVs will additionally get a remote finder button, first introduced in the Pro Series. This feature lets you easily locate a remote control buried between couch cushions or left in a different room. Additionally, the Pro Series’ integrated cable management, a design highlight we appreciated in our Roku Pro Series TV review, is also migrating to the Plus Series. Finally, the full Roku TV lineup will now feature a Bluetooth Headphone Mode, allowing for an easy wireless connection from the TV for private viewing. Roku’s Pro Series has been among our regular go-to recommendations for viewers looking to upgrade their TV to one with a mini-LED backlight without having to take on excess credit card debt. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. At under $1,000 for a 65-inch screen size, the Pro Series is an exceptional value, offering additional benefits such as4K120Hz support for gaming, a sleek design, and, of course, Roku’s excellent smart TV interface. With mini-LED backlighting now on the Plus Series, along with Smart Picture Max, remote finder, and integrated cable management, we may now have a new best budget TV option. Roku’s announcement indicated that the upgraded Plus Series TVs would be available at the “same affordable price.” With the current 65-inch Plus Series model priced at $649 (and now selling for $499), the new Plus series should be a compelling value, competing head-to-head with other high-value mini-LED TVs such as theHisense U6N.

Those critics include us: in ourBlack Mirrorseason 7 reviewwe said that perhaps Charlie Brooker and co should quit while they're still ahead. That said, the series does still deliver some great episodes: we really likedCommon PeopleandHotel Reveriein ourBlack Mirrorseason 7 episode ranking.Both episodes stick toBlack Mirror's most resonant theme: that technology can really mess with your head. Sometimes, of course, you actually want technology to mess with your head. It's why some of the most enjoyable shows are also some of the weirdest – and why I'm recommending these highly rated sci-fi and supernatural shows for you to stream. Stranger Thingsisn't so much a show as a phenomenon, and the world owes it a big thanks for introducing a new generation to Kate Bush's sublimeRunning Up That Hill. Oh, and for making some utterly compelling television too. Stranger Thingsis set in a sleepy midwestern town in the 1980s where weird things are going on. It's smart, it's scary and it often feels like a love letter to a much-maligned decade. As someone who was a teen back then, I'm well aware that growing up then was as much about expecting World War III as it was big pop songs and highly flammable clothes. AndSTabsolutely nails that.

And overall, it's a delight to watch.\" And theLA Timesraved: \"Stranger Thingshonors its source material in the best way possible: By telling a sweet 'n' scary story in which monsters are real but so are the transformative powers of love and fealty.\" The first season achieved 97% on Rotten Tomatoes and while later seasons haven't quite reached that high point they're still great, gripping TV. \"HavingStranger Thingswithdrawals?\" asksCNET. \"Tune in to the eerie supernatural German Netflix show that will make you think twice about stepping into caves.\" Stranger Thingscomparisons are common for this, well,Darkdrama. Here's theSydney Morning Herald: \"IfStranger Thingsis a big bowl of macaroni and cheese made with that lurid orange cheddar you can only get in America, Dark is a gamy Old World stew ladled out from a pot that has been bubbling away for centuries.\" Darkhas consistently scored highly on the Tomatometer, with the second season hitting the full 100% and season 3 getting a still exceptional 97%. It's an extremely twisty drama that centers on the disappearance of two children in a small German town – a disappearance that unearths the town's sinful past and something supernatural. Dark is the first German original series made for Netflix and has beendescribedas being rather like Lost, without just being another Lost. \"Dark’s creators Baran bo Odar and Jantje Friese’s have crafted a remarkable, labyrinthian series of interconnected characters, events, and consequences,\" saysLoud and Clear Reviews, whileCNETsaid \"For my money, it's the best show on Netflix.\" Natasha Lyonne is Nadia, a young woman who finds herself out of time: en route to a fancy New York party, she gets trapped in a mysterious time loop that has her attending the same event again and again and again. Season 1 and 2 both racked up a 97% critics rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and clearly delighted many reviewers: \"The show is perfect,\" saidLatinaMedia.co, whileConsequencesaid that \"It offers philosophy, humor, a strong cast, and sci-fi-esque twists and turns that feel intentional rather than hokey.\" Lyonne is remarkable,ScreenCrushsays: \"Natasha Lyonne gives a terrifically layered performance that ranges from hilariously funny in the early episodes to brutally emotional.\" AndColliderloved it. \"A brilliant tale of morality and mortality that finds an expert balance between sincerity, cutting comedy, and wild genre flourish.\" Writer, broadcaster, musician and kitchen gadget obsessive Carrie Marshall has been writing about tech since 1998, contributing sage advice and odd opinions to all kinds of magazines and websites as well as writing more than a dozen books.

Cybersecurity researchers from HUMAN have spotted a major ad fraud operation that leverages people’s interest in pirated content to generate ad revenue from otherwise non monetizable content. In an in-depth report, HUMAN explained pirated websites don’t host ads because they would “run afoul of most advertisers’ policies”. Instead, they are partnering with hundreds of website owners (scammers, basically) who deploy a set of fourWordPress pluginson their assets. These plugins are collectively named Scallywag, and they are designed to do a couple of things, but mostly to load as many ads as possible, and make sure people stick around until they fully render. There are a couple of tactics to slow visitors down, from the “please wait” button that turns to “download now”, to fake CAPTCHAs and other methods. The plugins are called Soralink (released in 2016), Yu Idea (2017), WPSafeLink (2020), and Droplink (2022).

It uses zero-knowledge encryption and offers features like two-factor authentication, dark web monitoring, secure file storage, and breach alerts to protect against cyber threats. Preferred partner (What does this mean?) After rendering the ad, visitors are again redirected and allowed to download the pirated content they were looking for. By the time HUMAN discovered the operation, it counted 407 domains and 1.4 billion fraudulent ad requests - per day. It seems the strength is in numbers, since the fraudsters even madeYouTubevideo tutorials, coaching other people on how to join: \"These extensions lower the barrier to entry for a would-be threat actor who wants to monetize content that wouldn't generally be monetizable with advertising; indeed, several threat actors have published videos to coach others on setting up their own schemes,\" HUMAN said. The researchers moved in to report and block Scallywag traffic, and claim to have largely succeeded. The traffic allegedly shrunk by 95%, although the operation is not entirely dead since threat actors rotated domains and moved to other monetization models.

    "title": "Andor season 2 is laying the groundwork for one of the most mysterious and tragic events in Star Wars history",
    "article_text": "Weaving a web of lies When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Andorseason 2has finally made itsDisney+debut – and, amid the numerous online discussions that its first three episodes have spawned, there's one above all others that's really gotStar Warsfans talking. Indeed, following the release of this season's first three episodes, it's all but confirmed thatAndor's final installment will cover one of the most tragic moments in the near 50-year history of Lucasfilm's iconic sci-fi franchise. Full spoilers immediately follow forAndorseason 2 episodes 1 to 3. Turn back now if you haven't watched them all yet. Andor has arrived.See episodes 1-3 of the final season of Andor now streaming, only on @DisneyPlus. pic.twitter.com/Ut8QfdW1qTApril 23, 2025 So, what emotionally devastating event is season 2 building towards? The Ghorman Massacre, which is not only a hugely pivotal moment for many characters involved in the Rebel Alliance, but one whose canonicity has sparked a fierce debate among Star Wars fans for many years. But let's not get ahead of ourselves just yet. First, let's explore how the final season of one of thebest Disney+ showsis laying the foundations to depict this grave moment in such soul-destroying fashion. In season 2's opening episode, Ben Mendelsohn's Orson Krennic, aka the Galactic Empire commander who's overseeing the creation of the Death Star, invites a number of high-ranking Imperial officers to a secret meeting at The Maltheen Divide. There, Krennic informs the assembled guests that nobody outside of this room – Emperor Palpatine and a couple of high-ranking officers notwithstanding – is to know about what's discussed at the gathering. Indeed, no notes are to be taken, officers' personal droids will have their hard-drives wiped once the meeting ends, said meeting shouldn't have been put in their calendars, etc. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. With that housekeeping out of the way, Krennic plays an infomercial-style video to his fellow Galactic Empire employees about the planet Ghorman. This world is famous for the spiders that weave the best silk in the galaxy, which is used to make the finest twill for the priciest clothes, which are sold across the cosmos. It's a strange mini-documentary to show to the assembled guests, including Imperial Security Bureau commander Major Lio Partagaz and Dedra Meero. But, hey, Krennic is nothing if not eccentric (he's also terrifying, but we knew that already). Anyway, there's a reason why Krennic played this video, and it's got nothing to do with the spiders that inhabit Ghorman. The planet is also home to a particularly important material – Deep Substrate Foliated Kalkite (DSFK) – which is apparently important to the Emperor's Energy Initiative. The public line is that DSFK will allow the Galactic Empire to create \"stable, unlimited power\" (Krennic's words, not mine) that can be used throughout the galaxy, but that's merely a front for the tyrannical regime's true intentions. Indeed, DFSK is actually going to be used to coat the Death Star's reactor lenses. This will allow the Death Star's crew to concentrate its planet-destroying beam to apply enough force to, well, destroy any planets and their inhabitants who oppose the Empire. Learn the behind-the-scenes secrets of building Yavin 4, Chandrila, Mina-Rau, and more locations from Andor Season 2: https://t.co/XuaShFS8Z5 pic.twitter.com/IR2n2ct0O2April 23, 2025 The Empire's problem is two-fold. For starters, excavating DSFK is an incredibly invasive procedure, so much so that it would destabilize the planet's core and effectively destroy it. If the Empire fails to find a suitable alternative to DSFK – it has three years to locate a substitute, according to Krennic – it'll have no choice but to begin \"gouge mining\" Ghorman for DSFK. The other issue is the Empire has little to no presence on Ghorman, so its sudden appearance would raise eyebrows and potentially lead to a rebellion from its 800,000-plus inhabitants. But the Empire has a plan. By building an armory in Palmo, Ghorman's capital, the autocratic regime plans to distract Ghorman's citizens by using it as a front to secretly ferry in the machines necessary to start digging for DSFK under their noses. With Dedra Meero also informing Krennic that he'll need an Empire-led insurgency on Ghorman to give the Imperials an excuse to start erecting said armory, too, the Empire's scheme will be fully operational soon. Alright, so what does this have to do with The Ghorman Massacre? Without spoiling too much, Ghorman's populace isn't naïve enough to simply take the Empire's 'we're building an armory, honest!' line at face value. With rebellions springing up across the galaxy as the embryonic Rebel Alliance starts to fight back against the dictatorial Empire, it's only a matter of time before Ghorman's own underground resistance is established. What'll be most interesting to Star Wars fans iswhichversion of events, neither of which has been covered in a big- or small-screen Star Wars project before, is depicted in season 2. That's because there are two incidents that bear 'The Ghorman Massacre' name in Star Wars literature. The most well-known one takes place two years before the Battle of Yavin (2 BBY), aka the battle depicted inStar Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope. The other, outlined in the now non-canonical Star Wars: Legends timeline, occurs in 18 BBY, i.e. well before the events ofAndor. For those unfamiliar with The Ghorman Massacre, I won't spoil what happens during either event. But, with season 2 episodes 7 to 9 in 2 BBY, fans won't have long to wait to find out which version not only serves as inspiration for the Ghorman Massacre in one of 2025'snew Star Wars TV shows, but clears up confusion about which event is actuallycanon.

    "title": "Russia easier to deal with than Ukraine – Trump",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has said he expected Vladimir Zelensky to be much“easier to deal with”than Russian President Vladimir Putin, but indicated he still hopes Kiev will accept Washington’s proposal to end the conflict in Ukraine. Zelensky haspublicly rejectedone of the key points in the proposedUS peace framework, insisting earlier this week that Kiev will neven even discuss formally recognizing Crimea as Russian territory. The White House criticized him forrevealing sensitive detailsof the negotiations – while President Trump warned that herisks losing the entire countryif he continues to stall talks with Moscow. “I think Russia is ready… I think we have a deal with Russia. We have to get a deal with Zelensky,”Trump told journalists at the White House on Wednesday. And I hope that Zelensky… I thought it might be easier to deal with Zelensky – so far it’s been harder. The US president added,“that’s okay, it’s alright,”expressing hope that“we’ll have a deal with both.” Earlier on Wednesday, Trump warned in a post on Truth Social that Zelensky holds a weak bargaining position.“The situation for Ukraine is dire – He can have Peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole Country,”he wrote. Trump declined to say whether he intends to meet Zelensky when both are expected to attend the funeral of Pope Francis later this week.“I don’t know if he is going to the funeral or not… I just hope he gets this thing solved,”Trump told reporters. Asked whether he expects to meet Putin during a planned visit to Saudi Arabia next month, Trump said it was“possible, but most likely not… I think we’ll meet with him shortly thereafter.” The US has been pushing for a resolution to the conflict, while also seeking to secure a minerals extraction agreement with Ukraine to help offset the billions of dollars it has spent supplying weapons and aid. However, Trump and his administration have grown increasingly frustrated with the slow pace of negotiations on both fronts. Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned on Tuesday that if progress stalls, the US may walk away from the talks.“If not enough movement is happening, we may need to move on to other priorities,”he said. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also voiced Trump’s frustration with Zelensky.“Unfortunately, Zelensky has been trying to litigate this peace negotiation in the press, and that’s unacceptable to the president,”Leavitt said on Wednesday. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted that a peace deal with Ukraine is unlikely to be concluded in an expedited manner due to the complexities of the negotiations. Moscow has said it has always been ready to engage in peace talks, provided they ensure a permanent solution that addresses the root causes of the conflict – while any temporary ceasefire would be used by Ukraine’s Western backers to rearm the country’s military.",

    "title": "White House accuses Zelensky of megaphone diplomacy",
    "article_text": "The White House has criticized Vladimir Zelensky for publicly discussing sensitive details of peace negotiations aimed at ending the Ukraine conflict. On Tuesday, it was reported that Zelensky publicly rejected a US proposal for territorial concessions to Russia, including the recognition of Crimea as Russian territory, as part of a peace deal. According to the media, the move has angered US officials, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio skipping Wednesday’s talks in London with European and Ukrainian delegations. During a press briefing on Wednesday, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt voiced US President Donald Trump’s frustration over Zelensky’s recent comments to the media regarding the talks. “Unfortunately, President Zelensky has been trying to litigate this peace negotiation in the press, and that’s unacceptable to the president,”Leavitt said. Leavitt stressed that the Trump administration believes such talks should be handled in private. “The president’s national security team, his advisors have exuded significant time, energy and effort to try to bring this war to an end,”she stated.“The American taxpayer has funded billions of dollars in this effort and enough is enough.” The remarks signal growing impatience within Trump’s team over what it sees as an unproductive public discourse surrounding peace efforts.“The president… is frustrated. His patience is running very thin. He wants to do what’s right for the world. He wants to see peace, and unfortunately President Zelensky seems to be moving in the wrong direction,”Leavitt said. The spokesperson clarified that Trump is not demanding Ukraine recognize Russian sovereignty over Crimea, but is instead calling for realistic dialogue.“What he is asking is for people to come to the negotiating table recognizing that this has been a brutal war for far too long.” She concluded by emphasizing the need for compromise in any future peace deal.“In order to make a good deal, both sides have to walk away a little bit unhappy,”Leavitt said.",

    "title": "Smoke in Rome: What’s really cooking between Trump and Tehran?",
    "article_text": "Last Saturday, the second round of US-Iran nuclear talks took place in Rome, following an initial meeting held a week before in Muscat, Oman. Both sides had described the talks as“constructive,”but that optimism quickly collided with a wave of conflicting signals from the Trump administration. Despite the encouraging tone, it remained unclear whether a new nuclear agreement was truly within reach. At the outset of negotiations, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz – an outspoken Iran hawk – laid down a hardline condition: Iran must completely dismantle its uranium enrichment program if it wanted any deal with the US. But after the Muscat meeting, Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, who led the US delegation, struck a very different note. In an interview with Fox News, he suggested that Tehran might be allowed to maintain limited uranium enrichment for peaceful energy purposes – something that would have been a nonstarter just days earlier. Witkoff emphasized the importance of strict verification protocols to prevent any militarization of Iran’s nuclear capabilities, including oversight of missile technology and delivery systems. Notably absent from his remarks? Any mention of“dismantlement.”This shift hinted that the administration might be considering a modified return to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) – the very agreement that Trump tore up in 2018, branding it a“disaster.” But the pivot didn’t last. Just one day later, Witkoff reversed course in a post on X, doubling down on the demand for full dismantlement of Iran’s nuclear and weapons programs. So what triggered the rhetorical whiplash? According to Axios, Trump huddled with top national security officials just three days after the Muscat talks to reassess the US strategy. In that meeting, Vice President JD Vance, Witkoff, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth argued for a pragmatic approach. Pushing Tehran to dismantle its entire nuclear infrastructure, they warned, would tank the talks. Iran had already made it clear that such sweeping concessions were off the table. Vance even suggested Washington should brace for some level of compromise. But not everyone agreed. A rival faction – led by Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio – saw things differently. They argued that Iran’s current vulnerability gave the US a unique upper hand, one that shouldn’t be squandered. If Tehran failed to meet America’s terms, they insisted, the US should be ready to strike militarily or greenlight Israeli action. The divide exposes a deeper strategic rift within the Trump administration. Between the maximalist view that Iran must be completely disarmed and the more flexible position that aims to curb weaponization while preserving peaceful enrichment lies a vast gray area. The lack of a unified message – or even basic consensus – risks leaving the US at a disadvantage against a seasoned and coordinated Iranian negotiating team. In short, Trump finds himself in a difficult balancing act. On one hand, it’s clear he wants to avoid military escalation. The decision to send Witkoff – a figure known for his willingness to compromise – signals a genuine interest in diplomacy over saber-rattling. If hardliners had the upper hand in Washington, it’s unlikely the second round in Rome would have happened at all. On Monday, April 21, Trump cautiously told reporters the talks were going“very well,”but warned that real progress would take time. His choice of words reflected a desire to stay flexible, while acknowledging the complexity – and risks – of negotiating with Tehran. Optimism seems more palpable on the Iranian side. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the two sides had found significantly more common ground in Rome than in Muscat. His remarks suggest that momentum is building and that real progress may be on the horizon. Araghchi’s itinerary also raised eyebrows. Before heading to Rome, he made a stop in Moscow, where he met with President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. He reportedly carried a personal message from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei – what he called“a message to the world.”The West didn’t miss the symbolism: the visit was widely interpreted as a public reaffirmation of the Moscow–Tehran alliance. Retired US Army Colonel and former Pentagon advisor Douglas MacGregor noted on X that any major American military action against Iran would likely draw a response from Russia, Tehran’s strategic partner. On that same day, President Putin signed a law ratifying a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership with Iran – further cementing political and economic cooperation. Against the backdrop of fragile US-Iran talks, the Moscow-Tehran axis suddenly looks more consequential. With these growing ties, Washington may find it harder to exert unilateral pressure on Iran. Meanwhile, not everyone in Tehran is sold on the negotiations. Many Iranian officials remain skeptical of Trump, whose decision to unilaterally scrap the JCPOA in 2018 still looms large. Their distrust extends beyond Trump himself to a broader concern: that future US presidents may once again reverse course. If Obama’s deals were dismantled by Trump, why wouldn’t Trump’s agreements suffer the same fate? Despite these tensions, major international outlets have confirmed that two more rounds of talks are planned: one in Geneva next week, and another in Oman the week after. The continued diplomatic activity points to a shared interest in keeping the conversation alive. For now, both Trump’s measured optimism and Iran’s cautious tone suggest that, at least in the near term, the risk of war has receded. This de-escalation in rhetoric reflects a deeper truth: despite lingering mistrust and domestic political pressures, both sides see value in staying at the table. You don’t have to be a policy wonk to see that. But in Israel, the mood is far more anxious. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – never one to hide his skepticism about engaging Iran – has condemned the talks. For Tel Aviv, negotiations risk softening Tehran’s isolation and threatening Israel’s strategic position. Still, Trump’s priority isn’t regional politics – it’s his legacy. He wants to be seen as the president who avoided war and brokered a deal the American public can get behind. In that light, Netanyahu’s objections may have to wait.",

    "title": "Trump task force vows to ‘end anti-Christian bias’",
    "article_text": "The White House has launched a task force to investigate the alleged anti-Christian bias within federal agencies, directing employees to report perceived discrimination against Christians among their colleagues, according to media reports. US President Donald Trump mandated the creation of what is called the Task Force to Eradicate Anti-Christian Bias in an executive order in February. The task force is meant to identify policies and actions across federal departments that have unlawfully discriminated against Christians, according to the document. “The Biden administration engaged in an egregious pattern of targeting peaceful Christians while ignoring violent anti-Christian offenses,”Attorney General Pam Bondi said at the task force’s inaugural meeting on Tuesday. Christians under the administration of Joe Biden were subjected to abuse and spying from federal agencies, she claimed. The task force will identify“unlawful anti-Christian policies, practices or conduct across the government,”as well as“find and fix deficiencies in existing and regulatory practices,”Bondi said. Federal employees have reportedly received instructions to report instances of this kind of discrimination among their colleagues. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has requested that their workers relay instances of“anti-Christian”bias, complete with names, dates and locations to a government email address, The Guardian wrote on Tuesday, citing an internal email from the body. A similar internal memo was circulated among US State Department staff, Politico reported earlier this month. Several senior members of Trump’s administration are devout Christians, including Vice President J.D. Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. A large share of white American Christians supported Trump's presidential bid, according to a Pew Research study from last year. The US president himself was raised Presbyterian, but announced himself a non-denominational Christian in 2020. After surviving an assassination attempt, and having several plots on his life foiled during his 2024 reelection campaign, Trump has repeatedly said that God spared his life. The majority of Americans, 62%, identify as Christian, while around 30% are non-religious, and 7% belong to non-Christian religions, according to a Pew Research study from February.",

    "article_text": "A meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, could happen on Friday, Axios reported on Wednesday, citing an unnamed US official. Earlier, Moscow confirmed that Witkoff would travel to Russia later this week. Witkoff has visited Russia three times in recent months for multiple rounds of talks with senior Russian officials, including Putin, as part of peace efforts undertaken by Washington and Moscow to end the Ukraine conflict. As part of a potential peace deal, Washington reportedly proposes to recognize Russia’s jurisdiction over Crimea and acknowledge Moscow’s control over four other former Ukrainian regions that voted to join Russia. The plan is also said to include the scheduled lifting of some sanctions against Russia and a denial to Ukraine's request to join NATO. On Tuesday, Vladimir Zelensky rejected any discussion of recognizing Crimea as Russian, prompting Trump to warn on Wednesday that Zelensky risked losing his entire country if he continued to undermine the talks. Witkoff, together with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, skipped a high-level meeting on Ukraine in London on Wednesday, following Zelensky's rebuttal of a key pillar in the US peace proposal. The UK Foreign Office later confirmed to AFP that a meeting of foreign ministers from countries backing Kiev had been indefinitely postponed, adding that“official level talks”will continue but behind closed doors.",

    "title": "US has ‘better understanding’ of Russia’s stance on Ukraine – Rubio",
    "article_text": "Washington has gained a much better understanding of Russia’s position on the Ukraine conflict, now that it has engaged with Moscow after three years of diplomatic refusal, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said. Rubio made the remarks on Wednesday in an interview with The Free Press, saying the US has been seeking to grasp what the Russian position is. “We have a better understanding of that now because we’ve actually spoken to them after three years of not speaking to them,”he stated. Ties between Moscow and Washington all but collapsed following the 2022 escalation of the Ukraine conflict under then-President Joe Biden. Since returning to the White House in January, President Donald Trump has distanced himself from Biden-era policies, pushing for a rapid resolution to the conflict and a reset in bilateral relations. The two sides have held several rounds of high-level talks in recent months. Voicing hope for a peace deal, Rubio emphasized there’s“no military end”to the ongoing hostilities. “We have to be frank. Russia’s not just going to roll over Ukraine and take the whole country. And Ukraine’s not going to push them all the way back to where they were before 2014,”he stated. “We’ve done our best,”Rubio told the outlet.“This is not our war. We didn’t start this war. We’re trying to help everybody end it,”he said, expressing hope to“bring the two sides closer.” Rubio was expected at a high-level Ukraine meeting in London on Wednesday with UK, US, French, German and Ukrainian diplomats. However, later Rubio and Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff decided to skip the event. The UK Foreign Office later confirmed to AFP that the foreign ministers meeting had been indefinitely postponed, adding that“official level talks”will continue but behind closed doors. As part of a reported“final offer”to end the Ukraine conflict, Washington had planned to present a proposal in London recognizing Crimea as Russian“de jure”and acknowledging Moscow’s control over the Lugansk and Donetsk People’s Republics, as well as Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions. The plan was also said to include the lifting of some sanctions against Russia and opposing NATO membership for Ukraine. On Tuesday, Vladimir Zelensky rejected any discussion of recognizing Crimea as Russian. Trump warned on Wednesday that Zelensky risked losing the entire country if he continued to stall talks. Moscow has maintained that the status of Crimea – which joined Russia in 2014 following a referendum held after the Western-backed coup in Kiev – and the four other former Ukrainian regions that voted to join Russia in 2022, is not up for negotiation. Russian officials also insist that any peace agreement must address the“root causes”of the conflict. President Vladimir Putin has also said that a viable ceasefire would require Western nations to stop arms deliveries to Ukraine.",

    "title": "Trump accuses Zelensky of harming peace talks",
    "article_text": "Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky could lose the entirety of his country if he continues stalling talks with Russia, US President Donald Trump warned in a post on Truth Social on Wednesday. Zelensky had publicly announced that Kiev will not even discuss officially recognizing the Crimean Peninsula as Russian, a key tenet of a Washington-backed peace proposal which it was to present at a meeting with officials the country's European backers on Wednesday. Following the rebuttal the top members of the US delegation withdrew from the planned talks, leading to the meeting being“downgraded”at the last minute. “This statement is very harmful to the Peace Negotiations with Russia in that Crimea was lost years ago,”Trump wrote, accusing the Ukrainian leader of prolonging the conflict. Crimea’s predominantly ethnic-Russian population voted to join Russia in a referendum in 2014, following a Western-backed armed coup in Kiev. Trump took to his Truth Social platform on Wednesday, declaring The situation for Ukraine is dire – He can have Peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole Country. Trump reiterated that Zelensky has a weak bargaining position in the negotiations.“We are very close to a Deal, but the man with ‘no cards to play’ should now, finally, GET IT DONE,”he wrote. The US has been pushing for a  resolution to the conflict, while at the same time trying to secure a minerals extraction deal with Ukraine to recoup some of the billions of dollars spent on arming the country. However, Trump and his administration have been growing impatient with the pace of the negotiations on both fronts, signaling that they may abandon the efforts. If the US determines that“not enough movement is happening, we may need to move on to other priorities,”Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in an interview with the Free Press published on Tuesday. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated in response that a peace deal with Ukraine is unlikely to be concluded in an expedited manner due to the complexities of the negotiations. Moscow has said it has always been ready to engage in peace talks, provided they ensure a permanent solution that addresses the root causes of the conflict – while any temporary ceasefire would be used by Ukraine’s Western backers to rearm the country’s military.",

    "title": "EU state’s PM issues Covid vaccine warning",
    "article_text": "Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has called for an immediate halt to government purchases of Covid-19 vaccines, citing a recent report that found mRNA jabs contain extremely high levels of DNA and substances that were not disclosed by the manufacturer. Bratislava initially considered outright banning the vaccines when a commission led by Peter Kotlar, an orthopedic doctor and member of the ruling Slovak National Party, published a report in October claiming that the mRNA jabs alter human DNA, have been inadequately tested, and therefore should not be administered until they are proven safe. Kotlar has also described the Covid-19 pandemic as an“act of bioterrorism”and a“fabricated operation,”and has accused vaccine manufacturers Moderna and Pfizer of turning vaccinated people into“genetically modified organisms.” His report, however, was met with significant pushback from opposition parties, as well as former Slovak Health Minister Zuzana Dolinkova, who cast doubt on Kotlar’s qualifications with regard to the subject. She subsequently resigned from her position that same month, citing government backing for an anti-vaxxer and insufficient prioritization of health care. In a post on X on Wednesday, Fico published a video in which he stated that ignoring the findings of the Kotlar-led commission on the quality of the Covid-19 vaccines would be“extremely irresponsible.” Fico noted that in March, he instructed the Health Ministry to establish a working group to address the findings of the expert report submitted by Kotlar, but acknowledged that this may not produce results quickly enough. The prime minister said he would try to resolve the issue in“a reasonable timeframe”and propose during an upcoming government meeting that apart from the working group, the Slovak Academy of Sciences (SAV) would also be asked to conduct a quantitative analysis of the presence of DNA and other substances in the vaccines. Fico also suggested that the government should inform the population about the“serious findings”regarding the jabs.“Although Covid-19 vaccination rates are extremely low, people deserve such a warning,”he said. The prime minister went on to propose that Slovakia suspend the purchase of additional vaccines from the unspecified manufacturer, which it is obligated to do under a contract signed by the former government in 2023. Bratislava is still expected to procure nearly 300,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines in 2025 and 2026, which is estimated to cost around $6.6 million, Fico said, stressing that“until the results of the additional quantitative analysis are delivered, the government should not procure further vaccines from this manufacturer or pay for them.”",

    "title": "French veterans demand disclosure on Ukraine involvement",
    "article_text": "A group of high-ranking French veterans has called for increased oversight of the country’s military involvement in Ukraine. In alettersent to the heads of both houses of Parliament, the former officers urged lawmakers to hold a formal debate on weapons supplies and the continued presence of French troops bolstering Kiev’s war efforts. The letter, titled the ‘Citizen Resolution’, was published earlier this week on Place d’Armes, a platform for current and former service members to express views on national policy. It included a public call for citizens to sign the resolution in support. The authors argued that France’s military involvement in Ukraine without a parliamentary mandate, and arms deliveries without public debate, violate the French Constitution and Criminal Code. They claimed that no clear communication has been made to Parliament about the possible presence of French troops in Ukraine since 2022, despite the legal obligation to inform lawmakers of any“military intervention.” The letter has urged the parliament to publish“all information”about troop presence in the Journal Officiel, the country’s official gazette, and to“organize a debate with a vote on the continuation of this intervention”within 15 days of receiving the letter. The document also noted that the French-Ukrainian security pact signed last year – which included €3 billion in aid and multi-year military support – has not been ratified by Parliament, despite the Constitution requiring such ratification for treaties having major financial implications for the state. “The lack of regular parliamentary ratification raises the question of the legality of the supply of weapons from the French army reserves to Ukraine for use against Russia, with which our country is not at war,”the letter states. The letter also highlighted President Emmanuel Macron’s recent remarks about potentially deploying troops to Ukraine and sharing nuclear capabilities with European partners. The authors argued that such decisions require parliamentary debate to ensure legitimacy. Commenting on the letter, the head of the Place d’Armes association, Jean-Pierre Fabre-Bernadac, told Sud Radio it reflects heightened public concern about the country’s involvement in Ukraine. “Is it a fable? Is there a reality of French troops on Ukrainian soil? This will be clarified by the National Assembly and the Senate,”he said.“The army is at the service of the nation. It is not at the service of a man or a regime.”He noted that his association did not write the text but that it was instead prepared by military professionals, including 26 former army generals. The heads of the Senate and National Assembly have not yet publicly responded to the letter, while the mainstream French media has largely been quiet about its existence. However, the document has been signed by over 14,000 people since its release. Despite numerous reports of Western troops in Ukraine, Kiev’s backers have avoided confirming any official deployments. Russia has repeatedly opposed the presence of Western forces under any pretext in the combat zone, warning that such a move would be treated as direct involvement in the conflict.",

    "article_text": "US officials are angered by Vladimir Zelensky’s public dismissal of an American proposal to make territorial concessions to Russia in exchange for a peace deal in the Ukraine conflict, according to the Washington Post. In public comments on Tuesday, Zelensky dismissed options that the administration of US President Donald Trump reportedly presented at high-level discussions in Paris last Thursday, which they believe could facilitate a peace agreement. One such proposal reportedly involved formal recognition of Crimea as Russian territory. ”[Crimea] is our territory, the territory of the people of Ukraine. We have nothing to talk about on this topic – it is outside our Constitution,” Zelensky stated. According to the Post, citing an anonymous official briefed on the situation, there is“anger in Washington over [Kiev’s] reluctance to accept proposals to cede territory to Russia,”and that Ukraine prefers“to discuss a complete ceasefire first and everything else later.” A follow-up meeting to the Paris talks between European and US officials had been scheduled for London on Wednesday, although it was abruptly downgraded when US Secretary of State Marco Rubio opted not to attend. Foreign ministers from European NATO members – including France and Germany – who were also due to gather in London followed Rubio's lead and skipped the event. Zelensky’s chief of staff, Andrey Yermak, who heads the Ukrainian delegation, stated that he and Ukrainian defense and foreign ministers would“discuss ways to achieve a full and unconditional ceasefire”with Western officials. Rubio had previously expressed hope that“substantive and good technical meetings”in London would pave the way for his rescheduled visit to the British capital“in the coming months.”Senior US officials have warned they will abandon efforts to negotiate a compromise truce between Ukraine and Russia if either side attempts to obstruct their initiatives. The EU and the UK are committed to continuing military support for Ukraine and are urging the US not to distance itself from the crisis, contrary to Trump’s announced intention. British and French leaders are reportedly willing to support territorial concessions by Ukraine, provided Western security guarantees are offered in return. Moscow has made it clear that it will not accept the presence of troops from NATO countries in Ukraine, a proposal championed by Paris and London.",

    "title": "700 koalas killed in helicopter sniper operation",
    "article_text": "Australian authorities are under fire following the culling of hundreds of koalas in the state of Victoria. Around 700 koalas have been shot by snipers from helicopters flying over Victoria's Budj Bim National Park, in an act of euthanasia following a devastating bushfire that scorched over 2,000 hectares of habitat. The fire left many koalas injured, dehydrated, and without food, prompting authorities to initiate the cull in early April as a means to prevent further suffering. Animal welfare organizations have voiced alarm over the wellbeing of orphaned joeys left behind, media reported on Tuesday. However, the approach – deploying snipers to shoot the animals from helicopters – has sparked swift and widespread backlash. Activists have raised concerns that decisions were being made by veterinarians and shooters from distances of up to 30 meters, increasing the risk of mistakenly killing healthy koalas—including mothers still caring for their joeys. ”The use of aerial shooting should be treated as a last resort,” Friends of the Earth Melbourne said in a statement, urging authorities to pause the cull and allow independent observers access to the site. ”This is the first time that koalas have been killed by shooting from a helicopter in Australia,” the organization said.“Aerial culling of koalas is an Australian first and sets a nasty ethical precedent.” The animal protection organization Koala Alliance echoed concerns about vulnerable young joeys potentially being left behind to starve or succumb to exposure. ”If koalas were shot out of trees, this means many joeys would be left to suffer and die. It’s despicable. It’s cruel,” the group said in a statement on Facebook. The regional government has defended its decision to conduct an aerial cull of koalas in Budj Bim National Park, citing expert assessments and veterinary advice. However, calls for an independent review of the culling process have been growing, with activists urging for more humane and precise methods of wildlife management.",

    "title": "EU refusing to lift Russia sanctions for peace – Reuters",
    "article_text": "The EU has firmly rejected the idea of easing Ukraine-related sanctions against Russia before peace negotiations are concluded, Reuters reported on Wednesday, citing sources. Last week, the US shared with EU officials proposals aimed at facilitating a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. The initiative reportedly outlined potential terms to end the conflict, including the easing of sanctions on Moscow in the event of a lasting ceasefire. Brussels, however,“staunchly opposes”Russia’s request to lift EU sanctions before peace talks are concluded, Reuters wrote, citing European diplomats. Another sticking point is the US proposal to recognize Russian sovereignty over Crimea – a suggestion the outlet described as a“non-starter”for both the EU and Kiev. The EU’s stance is reportedly seen as diminishing the chances of any breakthrough in the peace negotiations, prompting senior US officials to skip a high-level meeting in London on Wednesday held for discussing the Ukraine conflict. The gathering was due to include top diplomats from the UK, US, France, Germany, and Ukraine but ended up being downgraded to involve lower-level officials. Both special envoy Steve Witkoff and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are skipping the event. The US delegation is instead being led instead by General Keith Kellogg, another envoy of US President Donald Trump focused on Ukraine. Last month, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen declared the EU would not lift its sanctions against Russia for as long as the Ukraine conflict continues. Also in March, the EU rejected a Russian demand to lift sanctions on Russian Agricultural Bank as part of the Black Sea ceasefire initiative discussed between Moscow and Washington. During the talks in Saudi Arabia, Russia and the US agreed to work toward reviving the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which, according to the Kremlin, would include the removal of Western restrictions against the agricultural bank and other financial institutions. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov responded that the EU’s refusal to lift sanctions on Russia demonstrates the bloc’s reluctance to end the Ukraine conflict.“If European countries don’t want to go down this path, it means they don’t want to go down the path of peace in unison with the efforts shown in Moscow and Washington,”he said at the time.",

    "title": "Ukraine’s Easter tantrum: guns, gold, and guilt – Kiev’s loudest lobbyist demands salvation at the EU’s expense (again)",
    "article_text": "Most people keep their Easter expectations pretty modest: some pastel candy, a chocolate bunny, maybe even one that doesn’t taste like it was made during the Cold War. But Ukraine’s former ambassador to Germany, Andrey Melnik, has decided that this is the perfect time to send the Easter Bunny – also known, apparently, as incoming German Chancellor Friedrich Merz – a list that reads less like holiday funsies and more like a NATO procurement form. “I am a realist and have no illusions as to whether you will take up one or more of these ideas. Or even none,”Melnik wrote in anopen letterpublished by the German newspaper Die Welt last week.“But Easter is approaching. We are celebrating the resurrection of Christ, who overcame death on the cross. And we can hope for a miracle.” Alright, so what exactly is on this audacious list? A Ladurée Macaron or Fabergé Egg? A five-star Easter getaway to the Alps complete with Easter brunch? Not quite. Melnik apparently wants Merz to get cracking on getting Ukraine 150 Taurus missiles the day he’s expected to take office as chancellor on May 6. We’re talking the kind that can hit deep Russian targets, like the Crimean bridge that Merz keeps obsessing about openly. Melnik also wants 30% of Germany’s current inventory of fighter jets. But why stop there? Spoiler alert: He doesn’t. Look, how about I just grab you some marshmallow Peeps from the store? Classic yellow? Electric pink? Because that’s the sort of thing that belongs in Easter baskets – not precision-guided missiles. This isn’t even Melnik’s first holiday-themed ask. Over the last Christmas period, he wanted €20 billion a year from Germany. Not quite the usual stocking stuffers of socks, aftershave, or underwear. “The thing is that this should not be perceived as “Christmas charity”, as some call it. We are talking about Germany’s investments in its own security,”Melniksaidto Germany’s N-TV at the time. In Melnik’s new Easter plea, he also asked for 30% of the entirety of Germany’s weapons inventory. And all this is in addition to his proposal that a quarter of that 2% GDP that NATO countries are supposed to spend on defense – so we’re talking 0.5% of German GDP – should just be straight-up earmarked for Ukraine. He adds that Merz should also lobby the entire EU to do the same. Also? Confiscate €200 billion in frozen Russian state assets and reroute it to Ukraine. As in:“Hey Merz, could you just go full Ocean’s Eleven real quick and fund our rebuild?” Melnik also wants security guarantees, which, in plain terms, means that Germany would have to vow to step in and take a punch to the face itself from Russia if Ukraine does something face-punch-worthy. And even Melnik acknowledges right in his letter that he, personally, is highly punchable.“I know that many in the SPD – perhaps even in your own party – will once again be outraged: ‘How dare you!’ ‘Not that cheeky Melnyk again, who puts his two cents in everywhere.’ ‘We don’t need his advice, you pain in the ass.’ I can understand these reactions on a human level,”he said. But it’s all worth it, he says, because Russian President Vladimir Putin would sit up and take notice if Merz did what Melnik suggested.“This mega-commitment of €550 billion for Ukrainian defense over the next four years would be a massive warning signal to Putin that you, Mr. Merz, and our allies are serious about aiding Ukraine. That will impress Putin.” No doubt Putin could only marvel at Kiev’s consistent treatment of the EU as a 24/7 weapons vending machine, all while insisting that it’s doing the EU itself a big favor. Which is exactly what Melnik keeps saying himself.“Not only the future of Germany depends on your success as chancellor, but also the fate of Ukraine and all of Europe,”he says. Apparently, if Merz doesn’t risk World War III, he’s letting down the whole continent. And this is Melnik on his best behavior. When diplomacy doesn’t deliver, he shifts gears fast. Like three years ago, after Ukraine iced out German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier for being too chummy with Moscow, prompting Chancellor Olaf Scholz to cancel his own visit to Kiev. That led to this classic from Melnik:“To play an offended liverwurst doesn’t sound very statesmanlike. We’re talking about the most brutal war of extermination since the Nazi attack on Ukraine, it is no preschool.” Nothing says diplomatic savvy like slandering processed meat by comparing it to Scholz. Or reminding Germans of the Nazis as a means of seduction. Melnik’s like,“Hey man, help us out here against Russia. But it still isn’t as bad as that time when you guys genocided us.”What a charmer. And just when you might have thought that was rock-bottom, Melnik brings out the jackhammer. He once responded to Elon Musk’s Ukraine peace plan workshopping efforts on social media with a rather unique proposition, rarely observed in the diplomatic world.“F*ck off is my very diplomatic reply to you,”Melnikwroteon Musk’s own X platform. Turns out his style of diplomacy almost worked. Musk did, in fact, consider effing off, and taking Ukraine’s free Starlink satellite access with him. Now, fresh off this highlight reel of diplomatic brawls masquerading as strategy, Melnik is poised to strut into the United Nations as Ukraine’s new envoy. Buckle up, world, and get ready for wishlists, lectures, and the occasional middle finger diplomatic salute. Kiev might still be waiting on those Taurus missiles, but one thing’s for sure. Melnik’s weaponized mouth is always locked and loaded to friendly-fire on allies. And if the Easter Bunny doesn’t deliver the loot, guess there’s always another holiday right around the corner. Maybe try Oktoberfest.",

    "title": "US judge blocks Trump’s Voice of America funding cut",
    "article_text": "A US federal judge has issued an injunction against the decision by the administration of President Donald Trump to cut funding for Voice of America (VOA), ordering the government to restore resources to the state-funded propaganda outlet. VOA and its sister service, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, have long functioned as foreign-language broadcasting arms of the United States government. The outlets were originally created during the Cold War to spread pro-Western propaganda in the Soviet bloc, with RFE/RL initially being financed by the CIA. Recently, both outlets have depended on grants from the US Congress. Earlier this year, Trump ordered funding to be slashed for the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), the federal body that oversees VOA and RFE/RL. The move forced the outlets to put their employees on unpaid leave. The decision has been framed by the Trump administration as part of a broader effort to dismantle bureaucratic influence networks and shift toward soft power efforts in line with“America First”principles. On Tuesday, Judge Royce Lamberth of the US District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that Trump’s efforts to dismantle VOA were unlawful. The justice, appointed to the bench in 1987 by then-President Ronald Reagan, expressed concern over the abrupt defunding of the outlet, citing potential long-term harm to its employees and consumers. In his ruling, Lamberth ordered the USAGM to restore funding to VOA and other outlets under its umbrella and barred the agency from blocking their operation. He further stated that Trump’s slashing of USAGM funding was done“without regard to the harm inflicted on employees, contractors, journalists, and media consumers around the world.” Lamberth noted that his order does not apply to RFE/RL as he had previously already issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from defunding the outlet. Trump has described Voice of America as outdated, biased and an“unnecessary”burden on American taxpayers, saying it no longer serves the strategic interests of the country. His administration has sought to overhaul or eliminate many institutions associated with Cold War-era influence in favor of direct bilateral messaging. In 2017, Russia’s Justice Ministry designated both VOA and RFE/RL as“foreign agents”and required the outlets to label their content accordingly. In early 2024, RFE/RL was further classified as an“undesirable organization,”effectively banning its operations in Russia and exposing affiliated individuals to legal consequences. Following the US funding cuts, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in March that the decision was an internal matter but noted that“these outlets are not popular or in demand in Russia.”",

    "article_text": "The UK and France are“open to a scenario”in which Kiev would concede territory to Russia in exchange for Western security guarantees and aid, the Wall Street Journal has reported, citing an insider. London and Paris have emerged as the leading backers of Kiev’s war effort against Russia, after US President Donald Trump announced his intention to distance America from the crisis. Washington expects Ukraine and its European NATO allies to respond this week to itsproposedcompromise truce before presenting it to Moscow. European leaders are wary of acknowledging Russian sovereignty over Crimea and freezing the hostilities along the current front lines – conceptsreportedlyoutlined by Trump administration officials in Paris last week – the WSJ said on Tuesday. According to the newspaper’s source, the UK and France would prefer a deal with no formal territorial changes,“like the cease-fire that ended the Korean War.” That armistice, signed in 1953 by military officers from North Korea and the US, was never endorsed by South Korea, which continues to reject the authority of the government in Pyongyang. Without a formal peace agreement, the Korean War remains technically unresolved. Current hopes for a diplomatic breakthrough have been dampened byremarksfrom Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky. On Tuesday, he publicly dismissed certain ideas reportedly included in the Trump administration’s peace plan. Secretary of State Marco Rubio previously cautioned that the US could“move on”if either party delays progress. Moscow has accused the EU and UK of trying to undermine Trump’s mediation efforts. Paris and London have suggested a post-ceasefire deployment of Western troops in Ukraine, a scenario that the Russian government has deemed unacceptable under any circumstances. Washington has ruled out any future military involvement in Ukraine, asserting that European nations should handle its security. Russian officials argue that a lasting peace can only be achieved by addressing the fundamental causes of the conflict, including NATO’s expansion in Europe since the 1990s, and the rise of radical Ukrainian nationalism. According to Moscow, the Zelensky government aims to eradicate“all things Russian”within the nation.",

    "title": "Musk promises to cut back on White House role",
    "article_text": "Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has announced he will scale back his efforts to cut government spending at the controversial US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), and refocus on his businesses. Tesla suffered a massive 71% drop in profits and a 9% decline in revenue for the first quarter of 2025. Musk clarified though that he has no intention of stepping away from his work with DOGE altogether. During a conference call with analysts on Tuesday, Musk stated that with the“major work of establishing the Department of Government Efficiency”now complete, he plans to dedicate more time to Tesla and expects to spend only“a day or two per week on government matters.” The EV manufacturer, based in Austin, Texas, reported a net profit of $409 million for the first quarter of 2025, a steep decline from $1.41 billion in the same period a year earlier - the largest year-on-year drop in the company’s history. Tesla’s revenue also fell from $21.3 billion to $19.3 billion between January and March. Analysts have largely attributed the steepest sales decline in Tesla’s history to Musk’s role with DOGE. The tech billionaire has become an increasingly polarizing figure due to his close ties to US President Donald Trump and his work as the head of the unofficial agency tasked with slashing government spending. Since January, dozens of Tesla-linked locations across the US and internationally have been hit by protests. Musk has suggested the campaign could be a coordinated effort bankrolled by major Democratic donors, including George Soros. Musk claimed during the call, without providing evidence, that the protests were orchestrated by“those who were receiving the wasteful and fraudulent dollars,”saying that violent attacks against Tesla are“paid for.” “I think the right thing to do is fight the waste and fraud and try to get the country back on the right track,”he said.“If the ship of America goes down, Tesla will go with it.” Musk’s role as a special government employee is set to conclude by late May, after which the billionaire is expected to return to his private ventures. DOGE, created under Trump’s executive order, will remain active until at least 2026.",

According to anonymous sources cited by the Washington Post on Tuesday, both the ICCRAA and the interagency working group it led have been terminated. Previous reports indicated that the Trump administration hadwithdrawnfrom collaboration with an EU-led initiative aimed at investigating Russian nationals in connection with the Ukraine conflict, halted a Justice Department program for training Ukrainian prosecutors on handling these cases, andclosedan inquiry into Kiev’s allegations that the Russian authorities kidnapped Ukrainian children. Two major priorities of the Trump agenda include slashing government spending on programs deemed unnecessary and concluding the Ukraine conflict. The efforts to resolve the conflict reportedly reached a critical juncture this week, with Washington anticipating reactions from Kiev and European NATO members regarding its proposed compromise ceasefire deal before presenting it to Moscow. Secretary of State Marco Rubio cautioned last week that the US could“move on”to other issues if the negotiations stall. Neither Rubio nor Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, who outlined the ideas last week at a gathering in Paris, will attend this week’s discussions with Ukrainian officials in London, according to Axios. However, Witkoff is expected to travel to Moscow for follow-up talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Reports indicate that the US is proposing formal recognition of Russian sovereignty over the former Ukrainian region of Crimea, which voted to join Russia following the 2014 Western-backed coup in Kiev. Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky has rejected this, reiterating on Tuesday that Kiev’s claim to the peninsula is non-negotiable.",

    "title": "London Ukraine talks downgraded as big players withdraw",
    "article_text": "A planned high-level meeting in London to discuss the Ukraine conflict has been downgraded after several key European ministers withdrew from the talks. The development comes after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio signaled he would not be present. The meeting, initially set for Wednesday, was due to include top diplomats from the UK, the US, France, Germany, and Ukraine. However, the sit-down has been postponed and the discussions will now proceed at the level of officials, the UK Foreign Office has confirmed to AFP. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrey Sibiga is still expected to hold a bilateral meeting with UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, according to Sky News. The US State Department earlier confirmed that Rubio would not attend the talks, citing scheduling conflicts.“That is not a statement regarding the meetings; it’s a statement about logistical issues in his schedule,”spokesperson Tammy Bruce said on Tuesday. US President Donald Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, will also not be present and is expected to visit Moscow this week. The US side will instead be represented in London by presidential envoy Keith Kellogg. Trump recently floated what was described as a“final offer”to resolve the Ukraine conflict. The proposal would reportedly include“de jure”US recognition of Crimea as part of Russia and unofficial recognition of Moscow’s“de facto”control over the Lugansk and Donetsk People’s Republics, as well as the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions. The plan is also said to include the lifting of certain sanctions against Russia and opposition to NATO membership for Ukraine. Crimea and four other regions overwhelmingly voted to join Russia in referendums in 2014 and 2022, respectively. However, Kiev has refused to accept the results of the vote. A Financial Times report has claimed that Moscow would be ready to freeze hostilities with Ukraine along the current front lines. Commenting on the report, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov remarked that“a lot of fakes are being published now,”calling for people to rely only on“the primary sources”of information.",

    "title": "Trump makes ‘final offer’ to end Ukraine conflict – Axios",
    "article_text": "Washington has presented Kiev with what US President Donald Trump has called the“final offer”to end the Ukraine conflict, according to a report by Axios. The Kremlin, however, has urged the public to rely on official and primary sources for developments in US-Russia talks. The one-page document was reportedly drafted following Trump envoy Steve Witkoff’s four-hour meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this month, and was presented to Ukrainian officials in Paris last week, Axiosreportedon Tuesday, citing unnamed sources with direct knowledge of the discussions. Under the proposed deal, the US is said to be prepared to grant“de jure”recognition of Crimea as part of Russia, and unofficially acknowledge Moscow’s“de facto”control over the Lugansk and Donetsk People’s Republics, as well as the regions of Kherson and Zaporozhye. The plan also includes provisions for lifting post-2014 sanctions on Moscow and enhancing bilateral economic cooperation. In addition, Washington would formally oppose Ukraine’s bid to join NATO. In return, Ukraine would reportedly receive a“robust security guarantee”from a coalition of EU and other like-minded countries. The proposal does not detail how a purpoted“peacekeeping”operation would function. Russia has rejected the deployment of NATO forces, or troops from members of the bloc under a“coalition of the willing”to Ukraine under any pretext. The framework also promises Kiev unimpeded access to the Dnepr River and potential compensation for reconstruction efforts, although it does not specify where the funding would originate. The plan references a minerals deal between the US and Ukraine, which Trump expects to be signed on Thursday. Another component of the proposal, according to Axios, involves designating the area around the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant as neutral territory under US administration. Washington reportedly expects Kiev to respond to the proposal during a multinational meeting in London on Wednesday. Both Witkoff and Secretary of State Marco Rubio will skip the event, with General Keith Kellogg, another Trump envoy focused on Ukraine, leading the US delegation instead. Witkoff is expected to travel to Moscow for a follow-up meeting with Putin. Rubio warned last week that the US could abandon the peace initiatives and“move on”to other issues if the negotiations fail. Trump said on Monday there is“a good chance of solving the problem”this week. Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky has repeatedly ruled out ceding any territory to Russia and continues to urge the US and other allies to provide sustained military support. Moscow has stated that the status of Crimea – which joined Russia in 2014 following a referendum held after a Western-backed coup in Kiev – and the four other former Ukrainian regions that voted to join Russia in 2022, is not open to negotiation. Russian officials insist that any peace agreement must address the“root causes”of the conflict. Putin has also said that a viable ceasefire would require Western nations tohalt arms deliveriesto Ukraine.",

    "article_text": "Business Business TOKYO :Japan's tariff negotiator Ryosei Akazawa is planning to visit the United States from April 30 to hold second round of talks with his counterpart, public broadcaster NHK reported on Thursday. The talks would take place on May 1 Japan time if arrangements can be made with the U.S. side, NHK reported without citing sources. NHK also reported earlier Thursday that the Trump administration had told Japan's trade delegation that it could not give Japan special treatment regarding its tariff measures, in response to Tokyo's strong demand for a review during the ministerial negotiations held earlier this month. During the talks, Akazawa demanded a review of tariffs on automobiles and steel, but the American side said it \"cannot give special treatment to Japan alone,\" the report said citing multiple government sources. Akazawa told reporters after the first meeting he strongly requested a revocation of the tariffs. Akazawa intends to ask for a review again in the next negotiations and confirm it as a subject of discussion, the report said.

(Photo: AP/Alex Brandon) WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Wednesday (Apr 23) played up prospects of a \"fair deal\" on trade with China, but his top officials offered few details of how Washington might de-escalate its damaging tariff war with Beijing. Trump told reporters his country would have a \"fair deal with China\", adding that \"everything's active\" when asked if Washington was talking to Beijing. But how soon thetariffs can be lowered\"depends on them\", Trump said, referring to Beijing, even as he maintained that he gets along \"very well\" with Chinese President Xi Jinping and hopes they can reach an agreement. Trade tensions between the world's two biggest economies have soared as Trump ramped up levies on imports from China this year, imposing anadditional 145 per cent tariff on many productsover practices Washington has deemed unfair, and other issues.Beijing in turn has countered with new125 per cent tariffs on US goods.

But despite signals that Washington is looking towards a fair agreement, the state of discussions remains murky. Asked if there is direct US contact with China on trade, Trump said: \"Every day.\" But earlier on Wednesday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters that both countries are \"not yet\" talking when it comes to lowering tariffs. \"I think both sides are waiting to speak to the other,\" he said at an event on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank's spring meetings in Washington. He added that there is no unilateral offer from Trump to slash duties on Chinese goods. Bessent said the staggeringly high tariffs both countries have imposed on each other's goods have to come down before negotiations can occur. \"I don't think either side believes that thecurrent tariff levels are sustainable, so I would not be surprised if they went down in a mutual way,\" he added on the sidelines of an Institute of International Finance forum. \"This is the equivalent of an embargo, and a break between the two countries in trade does not suit anyone's interest,\" Bessent said, stressing that \"de-escalation by both sides is possible.\" But he had no timeframe on how soon bilateral talks could take place. \"It's both a blessing and a curse that the strongest relationship is at the very top,\" Bessent said, referring to Trump's ties with Chinese counterpart Xi. But with \"any de-escalation, the talks would not begin at the very top.\" While Trump has swiftly rolled out sharp tariffs on different countries and sectors, he has also been quick to introduce certain exemptions – most recently sometemporary reprieve for tech productslike smartphones and chipmaking tools. And he could widen the carveouts, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday, saying Trump could exempt car parts from some tariffs on Chinese imports -- alongside those on steel and aluminum. On Wednesday afternoon, Trump said he was not considering changes to US auto tariffs but noted that levies on Canada could rise in terms of cars. Separately, Bessent said on Wednesday that he did not have a stance on whether the president had the authority to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell if he wanted to. He suggested Trump's previous comment that the \"termination\" of Powell could not come fast enough might also refer to the end of the Fed chief's term. Earlier on Wednesday, Bessent said in a speech that Beijing's export-reliant economic model is \"unsustainable\" and \"not only harming China but the entire world.\" He stressed US concerns around trade imbalances that the Trump administration says it hopes to address through sweeping tariffs. But Bessent maintained that \"America first does not mean America alone.\" He insisted that the administration's moves are broadly a call for deeper collaboration and mutual respect among trading partners, while taking aim at policy choices by other countries that he said have hollowed out US manufacturing and put its security at risk.

    "article_text": "Podcasts Podcasts Father of three and PAP new face Dinesh Vasu Dash believes in letting his children set their own targets, \"just roll with the punches and things will be okay\". He took a significant pay cut, declined a private sector job to join the Health Ministry to fight the pandemic. Now Dinesh Vasu Dash is running on the PAP ticket as the new face contesting in East Coast GRC in what he describes as a journey with \"too many points of twists and turns\". He tells Otelli Edwards on this special series of the Deep Dive podcast what he has learnt from working with seniors and lessons on raising resilient children. Here is an excerpt from the conversation: Otelli Edwards, host:During COVID, you played a big part because you were pushing vaccinations and obviously (those were) uncertain times. How would you apply what you've experienced back then to what you're doing now, which is standing for the next election?Dinesh Vasu Dash, PAP candidate for East Coast GRC:Yeah, so I must add that the role that I've had in my life primarily involved getting things done and making things work for people. Often, I guess it's the season now, where we hear a lot, but we don't quite know how are these things going to be impacting residents. We can be talking at length about whether GST should be 9 per cent or 7 per cent or better, 0 per cent, but where would the money be coming in from? And how do we then fund the various other programmes that we have? So I think taking a holistic view of issues might be helpful. And not only the formulation of policy, but to make the policies work for people. You know, you've got to do a lot of tweaks and a lot of to and fros from whatever the ground experience is, so that it works for the residents on the ground. Otelli:So you (were involved during) COVID, and then now you're going to be standing in the upcoming GE. Saying yes to that, is it similar to saying yes or “I do” to someone, to your wife, for instance? I mean, is one decision more difficult than the other?Dinesh:This was probably a very difficult decision, if I were to be very frank, and it's because it's not just me, it's my family. And it's not just about doing your work quietly and making things happen quietly, but it's about being a bit more visible, being out, (being on) podcasts, engaging residents and so forth, which would come with some practice, to be honest. It's not something that's natural in me, because I tend to work quietly in the background, but that is indeed the requirements of the job.

(File photo: REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji) SEOUL: South Korea's economy unexpectedly contracted 0.1 per cent in the first three months of this year, the Bank of Korea said on Thursday (Apr 24), as the country reels from months of political chaos and heightened trade tensions. US President Donald Trump's threatened25 per cent \"reciprocal\" tariffs on export-dependent South Koreahave rattled Asia's fourth-largest economy, sending Seoul-listed shares tumbling and pushing the currency to its weakest level since 2009. The country is also still emerging from a political crisis triggered by former president Yoon Suk Yeol's December attemptto suspend civilian rule, which culminated in his impeachment and removal from office this month. \"Real gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 0.1 per cent compared to the same period last year,\" the central bank said in a press release Thursday, adding that it fell by 0.2 per cent from the previous quarter.

The country's economy expanded 1.3 per cent in the first quarter of last year but grew less than expected in the fourth quarter, as the fallout from Yoon's declaration of martial law hit consumer confidence and domestic demand. According to the Korea Customs Service, as of mid-April, the country's exports had dropped by more than 5 per cent compared to the previous year, with declines reported in nine out of the country's ten major export categories excluding semiconductors. The sharpest fall was inexports to the United States, which fell by more than 14 per cent. This week, the International Monetary Fund sharply revised down its growth forecast for South Korea this year, cutting it from 2 per cent to 1 per cent. \"The South Korean economy is facing structural burdens of high inflation and a weak won-dollar exchange rate, and under this dual pressure, a slowdown in growth is becoming increasingly evident,\" Kim Dae-jong, a professor at Sejong University, told AFP. Last week, Bank of Korea governor Rhee Chang-yong said the country's annual growth rate is now \"expected to fall short of the 1.5 per cent forecast made in February\". \"The tightening of tariff policies, which is much stronger than initially projected, will likely further weigh on growth prospects,\" he told reporters in a press conference. He added that \"political uncertainty has dragged on longer than expected, delaying the recovery of economic sentiment.\" Sluggish domestic demand, along with factors such as large-scale wildfires which tore through swaths of the country's southeast in late March, had also contributed to the downturn, Rhee said.

    "title": "Cam Ward Has a Vision for His NFL Career: ‘Throwing a Lot of Touchdowns and Winning Super Bowls, Honestly’",
    "article_text": "TheNFL Draftis patently absurd. Cam Ward, who has a good chance of being taken with the first overall pick in this year’s edition, knows this well. Apart from the obligations that most fans know about—nonstop meetings with front office executives from various teams, working out in athleisure underwear at the NFL combine—Ward says there’s a whole list of additional elements that make the process not only a bit odd, but a tad difficult as well. “Remembering all those names, that's probably the most difficult part,” he laughed. If theTennessee Titansdo indeed make Ward the first name off the board on Thursday, as many prognosticators expect, they’ll get a seasoned, well-traveled quarterback. Ward played a total of 57 collegiate games: two seasons at the University of the Incarnate Word, in his home state of Texas; two seasons atWashington State; and one final run in 2024 with Miami. Along the way, he honed an understated demeanor that many experts believe to be ideal forplaying quarterback at the highest level. That suave sophistication also led him to a partnership with Boss, who will beoutfitting him for the draft. Ward, 22, says he was drawn to the brand because they’re not big on frills. “I like how casual it is,” he said. “It really fits my personality. Smooth. They're not a real flashy brand when it comes to suits. That's the type of person I am. I like to just put something on, keep it moving. The colorways that Boss has just fit my skin tone.” Wherever he ends up, fans of Ward’s new team can expect to get a chill guy off the field with an uncanny knack for turning up the heat when it counts. It’s an ability that allowed him to set Miami’s single-season record for passing touchdowns in 2024, tossing 39 scores to just seven interceptions. But during his five years ofcollege football, Ward also developed some takes on playing on the road, why the transfer portal rules, and the happening town of Pullman, Washington. Cam Ward:I would say the craziest part is remembering all the coaches’ names. It’s easy to remember thehead coaches, because that’s the ones they show on TV and all that. But the OCs [offensive coordinators] in the league, that changes every year. So, you’re constantly learning new people: the support staff, the quarterback coach, the people who help out in the building. Let me tell you. The Saints, the Vikings, New Or—not New Orleans—Tennessee, Cleveland, New York [Giants], New York [Jets], Las Vegas. Jacksonville, Dallas. I would say at least 12 teams. I met the majority of them at the combine and the rest of them after. Yeah, it’s weird. Probably the weirdest part is how they make you do so much stuff outside of football. All that stuff. This one specific day you go to the hospital to get X-rayed. If you had some injuries or you had surgery, you’ll be there from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. The line’s backed up. I was blessed not to be there that long, but one of my teammates, [wide receiver Xavier] Restrepo, he was there all day. They do need to restructure the combine. Just get the football stuff done with. Because a lot of people who go in there, they’ve been training for three, four months on their 40 [yard dash and] the quarterback’s throwing and all that stuff. Then you get toIndianapolisand you sit for three, four days because you got to do all the meetings with teams first. The test...not the testing. The medical part, going to the hospital—everybody’s already ready to run! Now they just got to sit for three days. You don’t know what could happen. I would say the accountability that they put on thequarterback. The quarterback is the highest paid person in the building, so you also got to be able to take the most responsibility in the building. Them putting that accountability on me lets me know they believe in me. No, I didn’t get no crazy questions. I wish I did! I know a lot of guys got some crazy questions. I wasn’t one of them, though. I got it all picked out. Nice little suit with a shirt on. I was thinking of a collared shirt, but I didn’t want to do all that. I was trying to be comfortable. I did the collared shirt for theHeisman. I’m real simple. There ain’t going to be no flash. I don’t think you’ll ever see me in some crazy flashy stuff. No fancy jewelry. It’s just going to be some jewelry I’ve been wearing my whole life. I like getting dressed up. I think it depends on the event. For the draft I’m not even getting that dressed up. I’m just putting on a suit and I’m trying to hear my name called. I’m trying to get in and out. It taught me that the players shouldn’t get attached. Even I was attached to some spots. I didn’t want to leave, but you have to put yourself in a position to try to get to theNFL. You see it now with all the NIL stuff, a lot of people don’t like it, but it’s the best thing that could’ve happened for players, because now we almost got more control than the coaches. I think it’s good because, at the end of the day, coach can leave whenever he wants! But now the player can leave whenever he wants too. One game? I would actually say when I was at UIW. I played Southeastern Louisiana. I had like seven TDs, 650 yards.[Note: Ward had 610 passing yards.]Me and Cole Kelly, he was thequarterbackover there, we had us a good old shootout. The score was like 55-52. At Miami, I would say Florida. It’s better to beat somebody in their stadium than play at your own. I'd rather play on the road every game if I could. I don’t really like playing at home. Ward had 385 yards and three touchdowns in Miami's 2024 demolition of Florida at The Swamp. I see me throwing a lot of touchdowns andwinning Super Bowls, honestly. Not a lot of people get the opportunity that I’m about to get. I know it’s a short window that a player truly has to maximize himself and the people on his team, so I’m trying to get it all going the right way, the fastest way I can. It’s real exciting to me. I debated [that] even my freshman year in college. Like, would I want to play early, or would I want to sit a year? I think it’s more pros to both of them than cons. Playing early, you can get to your next contract earlier, maybe after year three. Sitting a year, you’ll be able to just grasp everything, see it from a sideline point of view, and be able to learn more. College helped me, because I played enough college football games that it'll translate over. I think the only difference between college and NFL is just theD linemenare a little bit faster. But at the end of the day, you just got to be a playmaker. It really don’t mean nothing to me. I did the same at Incarnate Word. I had more touchdowns at Incarnate Word, and more yards. Miami, their quarterback record book isn’t what it’s supposed to be, especially for a school like that. A lot of schools like that,who have that name like Miami does, their quarterback room has always been, stat-wise, up there with some of the greats. Miami just didn’t have that, because in the past they didn’t run offenses like what we did this year. We consistently threw the ball a lot. But it was good to have my name up there. I wouldn't take it back for nothing. I didn’t even get a chance to see the wheat fields when I went on my visit. I went in December and it was nothing but snow. When I got there they said that was the worst it snowed there in the past 10 years. We flew in straight to Pullman and we could barely see the roads.It was like a blizzard out there. My dad was like, \"Where are we?\" I didn’t even know. You just drive and then you see this little college town. It was a big culture shock, not only being far from Texas, but being on the border of the world. It was good, though. I had some good teammates, all of that. If you go to Washington State, you're only going there, in my position, for football. I’m not going there just for school. I was able to get a full ride, so it was worth it. Ward had eight rushing touchdowns in his lone year at Washington State, the most of any season in his NCAA career. Yeah. It is aparty school, too. It is a good school, though! I would say that.",

    "title": "What Is Skylrk? Here’s Everything We Know About Justin Bieber’s Mysterious New Clothing Brand",
    "article_text": "If you’ve been relatively plugged into the celebrity happenings of Instagram over the past month, you may have noticed thatJustin Bieberhas beenposting. The singer, long one ofthe most idiosyncratic dressersin Hollywood, has been teasing his new clothing brand, Skylrk, which has been in the works since at least 2023. What began then as a slow drip of sneak peeks—that December, Bieber was photographed wearing a pair of mysterious “Skylrk”-soled sneakers—has recently turned into a deluge of updates, with the singer constantly showing off samples, mock-ups, and design decks on his personal Instagram account. Justin Bieber wearing a pink Skylrk beanie in January. In real life, Bieber has become the brand’s zany figurehead as he’s modeled its forthcoming product line, which will feature earth- and candy-toned sweatsuits with matching beanies, sporty sneakers, puffy belted robes, futuristic sunglasses in playful shades like “Wax” and “Dusty Pink,” molded platform slides, bulbous phone cases, and at least onebasketball uniform. Justin and his wife,Hailey Bieber, both wore Skylrk while attendingCoachella, granting the brand the sort of splashy kickoff that most publicists could only dream of. Meanwhile, Bieber has publicly distanced himself fromDrew House, the streetwear label he co-founded with former stylist Ryan Good in 2019. Last fall, he also enlisted a new personal stylist,Jenna Tyson, who has been incorporating Skylrk pieces into Bieber’sboundary-redrawingensembles. On Wednesday, the singer shareda videoof rapper Gunna and streamer Kai Cenat posing in front of rows of shoeboxes, which he provokingly captioned, “Should we activate?” However, the grid for the official Skylrk Instagram account, which currently has around 395,000 followers, remains conspicuously empty. Here’s what we know about Skylrk so far. Bieber has been wearing the brand since at least December 2023, when he was photographed wearing mysterious pairs ofneon slidesand basketball-style sneakers with “Skylrk” embossed on the soles. Over the past year and change, Bieber has worn more unplaceable garments, such as the rolled-hemmed jersey skullcaps that The Cut recently said made him look like“a flirty barista,”that hehas since revealedto be part of Skylrk’s upcoming product line. As noted in a report byFootwear News, lawyer Bobby A. Ghajar filed severalpatent and trademark applicationsfor Skylrk and its bubbly dual-rectangle logo in May 2023. The applications outlined the brand’s planned product output, which would include footwear, apparel, and eyewear. (PerHighsnobiety, Ghajar, the filing lawyer, previously advised Hailey Bieber on trademarks for her cosmetics brand, Rhode.) Justin Bieber, seen here in December 2023, has been covertly wearing his own Skylrk pieces—such as these sneakers—for over a year. Resoundingly, yes. As of this month, Bieber publicly shunnedDrew House, the label he and former stylist Ryan Good launched in January 2019 with a collection ofsmiley-face-embellished appareland louche hotel slippers, which becamestaplesin Bieber’s wardrobe. Beyond streetwear, the Drew brand (Drew is Bieber’s middle name) once held loftier aspirations, too: Bieber even wore a slouchy “Maison Drew” tuxedoto the Met Galain 2021. “I Justin Bieber am no longer involved in this brand. Drew House doesn’t represent me or my family or life,” the singerwrote on Instagramon April 10. “If your [sic] rocking with me the human Justin Bieber don’t waste ur money on Drew House.” (Per a recent story inThe Hollywood Reporter, Bieber unfollowed Good—who served as best man at the Biebers’ South Carolina wedding in 2019—on Instagram in January. The singer also unfollowed a number of former associates including his ex-manager, Scooter Braun.) ACGI-rendered clipBieber shared on April 3 presented a thorny dramatization of this split: An animated Bieber can be seen walking through an unkempt house full of Drew House ephemera—including its signature teddy-bear mascot perched on a yellow pool floatie—before setting the house on fire using a box of Skylrk-branded matches. The clip is soundtracked by the Eddie Benjamin song “Maniac,” whose lyrics include barbed lines like, “I could’ve stayed, but I swear I couldn’t settle.” Meanwhile,the Drew House web storeis still live and active. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. We don’t know much about the specific size or scope of Team Skylrk, but the brand’s lead designer isFinn Rush-Taylor, a 28-year-old former competitive soccer player who hails from Scotland’s Western Isles. As a footwear designer and consultant, Rush-Taylor previously worked with Adidas, Puma, Vivobarefoot, and Crocs; his specialty is 3D modeling, which could explain Skylrk’s convex, digitized silhouettes. The designer made headlines in his native Scotland when, on March 31, Bieber publicized their partnershipon Instagram: “Damn me and this fool Finn cookinnnnngggggg,” the singer wrote, to which Rush-Taylor replied, “They ain’t ready broski.” A local newspaper, theStornoway Gazette,ran a storyabout how the local kid had teamed up with the global pop star; Bieber later posteda photoof the story on the paper’s front page, which prompted another news item inThe Times. Otherwise, Bieber purportedly has full creative control of the brand. Neima Khaila, who previously co-founded the Los Angeles streetwear brand Pink Dolphin, is one of his business partners. Justin’s wife, Hailey Bieber, also appears to be involved in the design process. “Working on creating my favorite jacket of all time,” wrote Hailey—who also serves as creative director of her beauty brand, Rhode—on Instagram this week, alongsidea mirror selfiefeaturing a black leather zip-up bomber with ruched cuffs and slanted front pockets. Hailey Bieber wearing a Skylrk bomber jacket on April 14. As of now, there is no official timeline for when general consumers will be able to get their hands on Skylrk, though Bieber continues to tease its release with wavy,campaign-styleshotson Instagram. Bieber’s business partner Neima Khaila, who previously shareda behind-the-scenes lookat Skylrk on his own social media, has already tempered expectations on when the brand might launch: “We been calibrating for like 3 years, they not ready bro,”Khaila wrotelast April. According to filings obtained byThe U.S. Sun, Bieber’s team requested an extension to file statement-of-use documents for each of its previously granted Skylrk trademarks in November 2024, ostensibly as a result of the brand’s stalled rollout. Thus, the concept-to-commerce pipeline chugs along. Well, skylark is a genus of songbirds, such as the Eurasian skylark, that are generally noted for their ability to sing during flight. Per Merriam-Webster, “skylark” is also a nautical verb meaning to frolic or scamper about the rigging of a ship. Some solid inspiration there, for sure. It is also the surname of Chip Skylark, a fictional disillusioned pop star—voiced by a real-life pop star, Chris Kirkpatrick of NSYNC—from the Nickelodeon animated seriesThe Fairly OddParents. Bieber, who recently turned 31, is squarely in the young-millennial demographic that grew up watching theOddParents-era of Nick cartoons, so I’d put money on the animated former boy-bander (who would perform his big hit,“My Shiny Teeth And Me,”with waning gusto) having some sort of influence on the name here. Not unrelatedly, Bieber may have even dropped the first breadcrumb about this brand all the way back in 2018, whenhe shared a photoof himself alongside actress Bella Thorne at Coachella with the caption, “Meet SKYLARK TYLARK (my alter ego).” Now, seven years later, we’re about to meet a “Skylrk” of a different feather. This story, which was originally published on April 18, 2025, was updated on April 23 to clarify the employees on Skylrk’s design team. Additional reporting by Samuel Hine.",

    "title": "La Sportiva TX4 Review: For Gyms, Climbing, and NYC Streets",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. Finding a stylishgym shoeI could wear whilenotat the gym is tough—but the La Sportiva TX4 EVO ST might finally be the cheat code for anyone looking to put together elite post-workout ‘fits,sweaty clothingand all. The brand is known for making high-quality outdoor gear (particularly footwear for trail running, hiking, and climbing) worn by some of thebiggest names in fashion. In the age ofSalomonsupremacy, lord knows we're all looking for the next big gorp-adjacent sneaker (ormaybe that's just me). Either way, if you need for a shoe that you can wear on a hike, at the gym, and whilewaiting in line at the Stüssy store, look no further. La Sportiva REI Backcountry La Sportiva Specs The TX4 is classified as an “approach” shoe, a style of shoe that aims to bridge the gap between a hiking boot and a climbing shoe. Approach shoes offer a climbing shoe's secure fit and grip, paired with the supportive and comfortable sole of a hiking boot. I took a pair of the previous iteration (TX3s) on a trip to Joshua Tree a couple of years back, and they served me well on multiple hikes of up to five miles with some elevation gain. They especially shined on more uneven terrain, allowing me to quickly and confidently scramble up boulders like someone with a Vital membership. When I returned to New York and started wearing the new TX4s to thegym, I found those same qualities also served as an asset to myworkouts. The grippy outsole made even theheaviest sled pushesa breeze, and the secure fit and stable platform provided a confident base for all manner ofkettlebellmovements. I took a pair of the previous iteration TX3s on a trip to Joshua Tree a couple of years back. The TX3s served me well on uneven terrain. The La Sportiva TX4 is an subtle statement maker. It feels more inspired by classic vintage silhouettes than some of its more technical outdoor shoe peers. The sole is more substantial than those in previous TX iterations, and it uses a recycled yarn upper. The La Sportiva logo is tucked casually by the heel. I opted for the Carbon/Mountain Red colorway, which is nicely understated yet still maintains a little pop of color (without feeling like you've got a color wheel on your feet). Overall, the TX4 does a great job of utilizing modern tech and materials while still staying true to the design cues of its predecessors. The TX4 is meant to stand in for a climbing shoe in certain situations—low-grade climbing, traversing uneven terrain to get to therealclimbing, etc. For that reason, the fit is rather snug. It's typical for climbing shoes to be quite tight, and La Sportiva definitely has a history of fitting particularly snug. I ordered my usual size, and while it isn't uncomfortable, you may want to consider going a half size up. Aside from the fit, these shoes arecomfortable. They come with a four-millimeter Ortholite Hybrid Approach insole that provides great support. The toe box is nice and wide, and there's moderate heel cushioning. Borrowing a design detail from climbing shoes, the laces extend far closer to the toes than your standard hiking boot or trail runner. This detail allows for a tighter fit when scrambling up a ridgeline, hitting that last set of box jumps, or staggering out of the wine bar. The TX4's climbing adjacent pedigree means that they feel rather stiff and responsive. The reinforced toe box, while not as strong as yourleather hiking boots, still goes above and beyond a standard trail runner in terms of durability. They utilize a patented Impact Brake System—a lug pattern with slanted and opposing angles that reduces impact and increases traction. These shoes are probably not the best choice for wet climates or rainy days: The recycled yarn upper is very breathable, ideal for warm weather but decidedly less ideal for keeping water out. Additionally, the tread isn't quite as deep as most hiking boots and may cause you to run into some traction issues in grassy, muddy, or overly wet conditions. The good news is that after your adventures inevitably take their toll on your kicks, you can make use ofLa Sportiva's Resole Platformto have the soles replaced. The TX4 EVO ST is a shoe that can do a lot. It'll serve you well on the street, while hiking, and if you're doing some light climbing. It's great in the gym, filling in as an all-purpose training shoe, and the understated outdoor style cues pair well with some vintage Levi's for a few beers on a weekend afternoon. Outside of long-distance running or heavy rain, this shoe really does have you covered. Plus, once you've worn through the soles (which should take you a while, for the record), you can get them replaced so they'll last you another few years. TL;DR: Get on the wave.

    "title": "19 Best Razors for Men in 2025, According to GQ Editors",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. Every guy has his own preference when it comes to shaving, and the best razors for men can be a pretty divisive issue. Chalk it up to nostalgia or sheer stubbornness, but plenty of dudes refuse to stray from the good ol' cartridge razor. Then, there’s the large group of shave enthusiasts and everyday gents alike who believe “once you gosafety blades, you never go back,\" while other fellas remain loyal to theelectric razorand its promise of fewer risks like ingrown hairs, shave bumps, andrazor burn. Which begs the question: What type of razor isactuallybest? We’re not here to pick sides, per se—but we can help steer you in the right direction if you’re curious to try something new. Already decided on your preferred type of razor and just want a new go-to brand to get it from? Our insights into the best mens razors covers all that, along with how to shop for the best razor if you need a little more intel on which types of blades suit different skin and stubble needs. But know this: If you’re experiencing consistent irritation, you might need to switch up your general approach to the process—either by overhauling yourshaving regimenentirely or revisiting the canonizedrules of razor hygiene. “Shaving is more of a ritual than a single act of taking blade to skin,” saysGQ’s resident grooming expert, barberMatty Conrad. “The process is often more important than the individual tools. A man whose skin is sensitive or prone to ingrown hairs will not completely correct these issues by buying a more expensive razor or changing up his can of foam. It requires a process, and often multiple products working in tandem to create a better shaving experience.” That said, it's still imperative to audit the tool you’re using to shave, and to find the best one for your needs. Read on for a roster of the best razors for men, from our own comprehensive experience along with insights from Conrad, and board-certified cosmetic surgeon and dermatologistAriel Ostad. Leaf Shave Amazon Leaf Design Features: Single-edge blades, base twists for easy blade loading, recyclable and plastic-free I've been a huge fan of Leaf since they came on the scene (via Kickstarter, in 2016, believe it or not). And while their initial launch—the Hybrid—gave you all the best parts of a cartridge and safety razor combined, I think their second razor deserves some major spotlighting. It also launched via Kickstarter (in 2020), and is more of a straightforward single-edged straight razor,butit's the kind that can easily convert cartridge-stubborn shavers (like me, previously). The blade loading is extremely easy, with a twist at the base to insert, fasten, and remove any of the blades, and I've never had an easier time drawing clean, no-crumbs strokes on full shaves. I attribute the \"ease of transition\" to the tinny barrier bar that precedes the blade; it almost coaches you as to how to angle the blade, and prevents any mishaps even if you're a newbie. And aside from being terrific for full shaves, it's also proven effective at keeping my facial hair lines tidied, too—my cheeks and neckline, that is, whenever I grow things out. Ditto for the hairs just under my nose, which I like to keep tidied so that my mustache has better curvature all throughout; this one is precise enough to mind those tiny details. There's a lot to love about Leaf as a brand too, from full-metal recyclable parts to beautifully designed products. Color me a big fan. Gillette Amazon Walmart Walgreens Number of Blades: 5Design Features: Anti-friction blades mow through thick pubic hair, added lubrication nourishes sensitive parts, shower holder allows for fast and easy tune ups You're brave totrim your body hairwith a bare razor, but if you must, use a tool that won't get caught on stuff stubble and will leave your precious pubis pearly smooth. With double the lube and an anti-friction blade design, these five-blade cartridges from Gillette deliver much smoother results than other razors. It might contradict the notion that you want fewer blades in your intimate parts,but, I find it a lot easier to get the task done in a single pass, and with the ergonomic angles necessary when I use this one. So, while I'd otherwise tell ya to let it grow (albeit trimmed nicely) or to wax it clean; if you're going to bare shave, consider this razor the sole option I'll endorse for your most sensitive bits. HeadBlade Amazon HeadBlade Number of Blades: 1Design Features: Rollerball navigates head contours, easy palm-held grip with finger ring, flexible design pivots every which way for uniformly smooth finish Think of this like a little Zamboni that you grip in your palm and glide around your dome, polishing things up with aplomb—despite having so many blind spots along the way. That’s HeadBlade’s whole area of expertise: products designed for smooth, soothed, and eye-catching shaved heads. The HeadBlade shaver is its namesake, and some 2,000+ five-star reviews on Amazon can’t be lying about its ease of use and efficient results. And while I'm not bald, my brother Sam is the one who tests all things bald for me, and he's been loyal to the HeadBlade for as long as I can remember. It's fast, easy, and he basically operates it on autopilot now, he says. GilletteLabs Amazon Target Walmart Number of Blades: 5Design Features: Exfoliating bar removes dead skin to minimize razor burn, flexible head pivots generously to both sides as well as front and back Quick background before I explain this pick: While there's a lot of messaging around “exfoliating before shaving,” I think it is often too risky to do agritty scrubor to use achemical exfoliantright before you rub a sharp razor over the skin. It's a recipe for irritation, despite your intentions being true. Yes, it's good to have as little dead skin as possible (to minimize razor drag), but I think it should be part of yourregularskin care regimen, not your pre-shave routine. So, that's why I think GilletteLabs' invention here is the perfect solution: You know how many cartridge razors have a lubricating strip that cushions skin after of the blade? Well, this one also has a buffing baraheadof the blades to do the very light same-day exfoliation work. It's like a snow plow for your skin—pushing the dead stuff away for a smoother, bump-less result—and on top of that, it's Gillette, so it's been as efficient and effective for each shave as I'd expect. It's a good example of “reinventing the wheel” that actually offers something new and improved. Merkur Amazon Merkur Design Features: 1 double-sided replaceable safety blade, brass handle, die-cast zinc razor head, bright chrome, closed comb, straight cutDimensions: 4.2 cm x 2.5 cm x 10.2 cm I gave this pick to the barber, since my “overall” winner was a safety razor, too. So, consider this a runner up in that field, as well as the barber's favorite for customers. “Merkur's 38C Long Handle is as classic as they come,” he says. “Honestly, most three-piece safety razors are going to be more or less the same functionally with varying degrees of quality when it comes to the blades (Feather bladesare my favorite)…” but Merkur has a reputation for quality in the barbering and safety-razoring communities. If you are a true novice in safety razor shaving, consider theshort-handle 34C option from Merkurtoo; it might offer you more control as you get ahold of things, though if you've got big hands, then Conrad's pick here is a more reliable option. Feather Artist Jatai Design Features: Compatible with Feather blades (single edge),teakwood handle, Japanese madeDimensions: 14.5 cm body x 13 cm handle Here's another pick from Conrad, who has a lot more mileage with straight razors than I do. \"Stropping and honing a blade to keep a razor sharp edge is not a skill to take lightly. It takes many hours of practice just to become good enough to maintain a straight razor, let alone use one on your own face. So, for everyone who wants to straight shave without the hassle of sharpening, I recommend the Feather Artist Club Series because it uses replaceable disposable blades which are always factory sharp, and is the closest thing to an actual straight razor I have found in a shavette.\" Philips Norelco Amazon Amazon Amazon Shaving head (PRO Model):Dual-sided head trims or shaves from all sides; trimmer attachment allows for 5 length settingsBattery:NiMHRun time:45 minutesCharge time:8 hoursQuick charge:NoWaterproof:Yes I love a multitasking grooming product, and Philips Norelco's OneBlade trimmer-shaver can handle just about every hair-taming task you assign. Be it facial hair or body hair, it can trim, shave, or detail as you need, wet or dry, and has interchangeable double-edged blades for every use. It even comes with a skin guard for those more precious, sensitive spots. I also called it one of my favorite electric shavers, but this thing is unclassifiable since it feels like a hybrid between shaver, trimmer, and cartridge razor. It does everything except leave skin irritated; best of all you can use it to customize facial hair styles; the trimmer manages length while the shaver tends to the edgework. Supply Supply Design Features: 1 single-sided replaceable safety blade, side-loading cartridge, intuitive angular head, nick-stopping fins at base TheShark Tank-backed Supply uses a nifty sliding installer to load single bare-metal blades straight into its sleek metal frame. Many new safety-blade shavers don't love handling a bare blade, and Supply’s razor takes care of that. Consider it driving automatic compared to the manual-transmission double-sided shave from more traditional safety razors. You still get a close, smooth shave from a simple single-blade design, but without the fuss—and because it's a single blade, it minimizes any agony on the skin. That's perfect for whenever I'm going long stretches without shaving. Typically, in times of frequent shaving, I'm alternating between this and Leaf, and I find them most comparable on this list. But Conrad echoes my sentiments for this one being great for sensitive skin, too: “This one is designed for maximum protection of the skin with minimal irritation or nicks,” he says. Braun Amazon Braun Shaving head:Foil (5 elements including two foil blades and three additional cutting and lifting component)Battery:Lithium-ionRun time:1 hourCharge time:1 hourQuick charge:5 minutesWaterproof:Yes Here's another all-time favorite electric razor of mine, which earned a much deserved accolade in ourbest electric shaverarticle. And since I praised it so much there, I'll let Conrad add his two cents on this list. “For guys that have a lot of acne I usually recommend Braun's electric foil razor. Ideally you don't want a razor gliding over acne bumps causing nicks and irritation which can also lead to scarring. The technology for these has actually surged in the last few years and the level of protection it gives the skin's surface while still achieving a shockingly close shave is remarkable.” Bolin Webb Amazon Bolin Webb Gillette Fusion5 Cartridges Number of Blades: 5 (on Gillette Fusion5)Design Features: Aluminum handle and stand, slip-proof grip (on Bolin Webb Generation razor) Bolin Webb's beautiful, sleek razor won a BritishGQGrooming Award last year, given its trophy-esque state. And when paired with a Gillette cartridge (which the brand tends to recommend), you have a recipe for some seriously efficient, swift shearing—perfect for thick and coarse stubble that otherwise struggles with resistance and razor drag. “While I usually recommend a safety razor for thick stubble—since they get get clogged up—if you are one of those guys whose face is made of granite and you are looking for the smoothest shave possible, Gillette Fusion5 is a pretty tough customer [thanks to its reinforced, anti-friction design]. Class it up a little by ditching the factory handle and get yourself something a bit more stylish like Bolin Webb's razor.” BIC Amazon Target Number of Blades: 4Design Features: Precision edging blade, aloe-packed lubricating strips to ensure results as soothing as they are smooth Somewhere in the “more is better” marketing blitz, we lost track of the fact that fewer blades yields better spacing when it comes to rinsing the razor, and preventing razor drag between strokes. I love that BICs' disposables here deliver on their promise of less drag and more efficient results (which is usually why I'd suggest skipping disposables in the first place). They have 30% more space between the blades than their closest competitors. So if you need a razor in a jiffy, or you just don't shave enough but need a sensitivity-minded one stocked up, then look for EasyRinse. Gillette Amazon Number of Blades:2 Design Features:Patented irritation defense bar helps blades cut hair while barely touching skin, enhanced lubrication before and after blades, precision trimmer on back of cartridge for lineups. For men who've resorted to maintaining perpetual stubble just toavoid razor bumps, this razor could be the game-changer that brings back your clean-shaven era. What makes this design unique is the “irritation defense bar” (very serious!) situated between the twin blades: The defense bar absorbs pressure from your hand while slightly raising the blades from the skin, creating the ideal distance for cutting hairs without aggravating sensitive areas. I was particularly impressed with how it handled my neck and jawline—traditionally problem areas where I can end up with irritation and ingrown hairs. The aloe-infused lubrication strips create a super smooth glide that breezily gets the job done. The handle is lightweight without feeling flimsy, and while I wouldn't reach for this razor to hack through a week's growth, it's become my go-to \"closer\" for achieving a gentle, irritation-free finish. Harry's Harry's Design Features:Water-resistant tear-resistant fabric case, travel-size essentials including Harry’s classic Truman handle, travel-size Shave Gel, and a travel blade cover. If you’re always in the TSA PreCheck line and care about keeping your shave consistent, might I suggest upgrading from your raggedy collegetoiletry bagto a dedicated travel shaving kit? We all know Harry’s as the OG’s of making high-quality razors at accessible price points. This kit includes their signature Truman razor, a travel cover to protect your blades (essential for keeping them clean and helping them lasting longer), a travel-size shave gel that lathers up well and smells good, and a slim, durable zip case that’s water resistant and easy to clean. It’s got everything you need and nothing you don’t–perfect for throwing into your carry on so you don’t have to resort to risking it with a hotel front desk disposable razor the morning before a big meeting. MÜHLE Amazon Design Features:Steamed Ash wood construction, black fiber vegan shaving brush, traditional single blade safety razor, chrome-plated soap dish and stand If you’ve spent most of your shaving journey tossing a plasticky razor into a drawer, allow me to put you on to the beauty of an old-school shaving stand. This German-made set from MÜHLE is basically bathroom counter eye candy—elevating your bathroom decor instead of cheapening it. The real ash wood is gorgeous (that deep, rich grain comes from a special steaming process) and the brush feels fantastic against your skin and whips up a rich lather without using animal hair (yep, it's vegan). Plus, as this is a classic safety razor, you’ll be able to invest in this kit and swap in replacement blades for decades to come with no plastic waste. Chicandsmart. Gillette Amazon Number of Blades:5 Design Features:Stainless steel warming bar, adjustable temperature levels, wireless magnetic charging, waterproof design Is there anything more blissful than the moment your face is wrapped up in a barber’s hot towel? With the noble goal of taking your everyday shave and turning it into something more luxurious, the GilletteLabs Heated Razor brings that barbershop bliss into your bathroom. The stainless steel warming bar heats up instantly and maintains a strong and satisfying heat that I found made the whole shaving experience more enjoyable. Plus, given that heat is known to help your skin’s pores stay open, applying it directly to the skin while simultaneouslycutting hairhelps reduce ingrown hairs and irritation. On top of the headline heating feature, this razor just feelsgood–with a weighty aluminum-zinc handle, GilletteLab’s agile FlexDisk head, and a sleek magnetic charging dock. While the price point puts it firmly in the luxe category, if traditional shaving leaves you cold—literally and figuratively—this could be the upgrade that makes you look forward to your next shave. Henson Amazon Henson Style commerce writer Gerald Ortiz says this double-edged joint from Henson is his go-to pick. Bonus points for the cool blue colorway. Bevel Amazon Bevel Senior commerce editor Ian Burke loves his Bevel safety razor. “It's got a great weight to it,” he says. “Even though I keep a beard, I like to use this to clean up my neck and edges.” Harry's Harry's You can't get more classic than the bright-orange handle of Harry's Truman razor: It's an affordable and dependable stalwart in the grooming game. Dovo Amazon If you're going to be running a straight razor across your face, we suggest splurging on a nice one. Your cheeks will thank you! Here’s a quick guide to the different types of razors, and what to expect or look for in each. Since the above types of razors often boil down to preferences and prices, it’s also imperative to consider any unique variables that affect your shave routine—from facial hair growth patterns to skin sensitivities. Here is what to factor in, according to Conrad. I’ve tried it all. Testing grooming products is my job, and has been for over a decade; I’ve also beenGQ’s go-to expert on all things grooming since 2016. And whenever I have blind spots, I call in the experts like Matty Conrad,GQ’s other resident expert on this stuff. He’s a barber, so he’s shaved many faces. While I get tons of razors, he has tons of clients, so by our powers combined, this list was born. And it’s not just about the products we’ve loved for many years. We keep our eyes on what’s new, and try to keep these lists updated as one product ekes out another in any category. What is the best razor for men? In our roundup of the best mens razors, we gave Leaf’s single-edge safety razor (The Twig) the top prize for its ease of use, beautiful design, and its ability to convert cartridge shavers over to the safety-blade world, since it makes things so easy for first-time safety razor users. What is the top razor brand? Look, we don’t want to say any single brand is the best of the best,butthere are far more mentions of Gillette on this roster than any other brand, so maybe that’s the easiest way to answer. How many times can razors be used before replacing them? Our general suggestion for razor replenishment is to toss out blades after every 6-8 uses, or after 2-3 weeks—whichever of those two things comes first. You never want them to accumulate too much dust, rust, or bacteria, nor to become too dull.

    "title": "Apple Watch Is Still the Best Fitness Tracker, 10 Years Later",
    "article_text": "The Apple Watch, which was released on April 24, 2015, wasn’t the first fitness tracker or even the first smartwatch. (Depending on how you define those categories, they had been around for as much as half a century already.) But it did set a new industry standard and shape fitness trackers as we know them today. When Tim Cook unveiled it, he said the goal was to make the best watch in the world. While “best” is a subjective term, Apple Watch has objectively become the most popular timepiece on the planet, by both present-day market share and all-time number of units sold. But I’m not sure even Cook imagined the impact Apple Watch would make on fitness, where it has become the de facto wearable for anyone looking to measure and maximize their health, fitness, and general well-being. “When we look all the way back to how it started, we would have never anticipated that the watch would be doing as many things as it's doing to impact people's health,” says Jay Blahnik, Apple’s vice president of fitness technologies, who leads the team responsible for developing fitness features across Apple hardware, software, and services. But you don’t have to take it from an Apple employee. Take it from me, a veteran fitness editor who has worn an Apple Watch for the better part of its decade-long existence. With core features rooted in behavioral psychology and functionality tempered by the realities of human nature, the Apple Watch is, to me, still the best fitness tracker that money can buy. Many fitness trackers tout advanced metrics and accuracy but neglect to take into account the user’s general well-being. Fitness can only be built on a foundation of good health, and to ignore this fact is to invite inconsistency, frustration, and even injury. “The science was indicating, even 10 years ago, that while quantity [of activity] is important, intensity and frequency is also important; just moving around is not enough,\" says Blahnik. In fact, it was right around the time of the Apple Watch’s 2014 reveal that a landmarkstudyrevealed that extensive sitting can counteract the benefits of exercise. “We really did focus on this idea of how we could help people sit less, move more, and get some exercise. That was sort of our mantra from the very beginning,” says Blahnik. “It inspired the Activity app, and it inspired the notion of the three rings.” The rings, which track standing, movement, and exercise, serve as the core of Apple Watch’s Activity app. They’ve been baked in from day one, and have become a defining feature of the product, complete with progress notifications throughout the day to keep you on track and celebratory animations to acknowledge wins. As the old saying goes, the best workout is the one you stick with. More than the specifics or intensity of your workouts, consistency is the true key to effectively and safely building fitness over time. And it’s a central pillar of Apple Watch’s user experience. While most fitness trackers lay out your training data in a way that invites comparison between workouts, regardless of how far apart those sessions occurred, Apple Watch’s user interface prioritizes consistency. “Behavior change does not necessarily mean constantly getting better,” says Blahnik. “It could be about becoming super consistent.” The accompanying Fitness app lays out all your sweat sessions in a traditional calendar format. While simple, this is actually one of the most effective ways to keep yourworkout motivationalive, according to a peer-reviewedmeta-analysispublished in the journalBMC Public Health. Apple Watch takes the star chart approach a step further, rewarding those who check the box, but even more so those who smash it. “One of the most profound ways to encourage behavior change is, don't just let me know when I've completed my goal, give me a super-big high five when I've exceeded it, so I can take that energy into the next day,” says Blahnik. Simple, habit-forming features that reduce time spent sitting and improve workout consistency are great, but they’re not exactly the kinds of things that draw serious athletes to a fitness tracker. But a decade’s worth of updates and improvements have endowed Apple Watch with a dizzying array of metrics to satisfy even the most data-driven athletes. “For every person who loves the sparkly rings, someone else might say, ‘I’d really love to know my ground contact time and my vertical oscillation when I run.’ And so our teams work really hard to release features that are great for the person just starting out, but also for that elite athlete that wants to dig deeper,” says Blahnik. Apple Watch Ultra 2can automatically detect if your outdoor run is taking place on a track and then measure your performance based on the specific lane you’re in. Triathletes will see the watch’s interface display sport-specific metrics in real time as they move from swim to bike to run. Hikers can set waypoints and retrace their steps if they get lost. Gym goers can monitor their training load to maximize recovery and avoid overtraining. And this is barely scratching the sapphire crystal surface. Crucially, though, the watch never feels cluttered with features, data, or charts, as many others do. “We always say that, even when we're developing those more experienced consumer features, they shouldn't overwhelm someone who is more of a beginner,” says Blahnik. They should be easy to find and easy to use if you love them, but they shouldn't burden people who don't want to use them.” Apple Watch offers Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, dual-frequency GPS, and even cellular connectivity. That right there is already more than can be said for any other fitness tracker, but what I’m talking about is how it connects us to other people. With activity sharing, Apple Watch eschews the social network model favored by many competitors to focus instead on connecting you directly with the people you actually care about. I can’t count the number of times I’ve been swayed to hit the gym because of a notification saying that one of my close friends just completed a workout. And the option to set up a weeklong head-to-head challenge is great fun. I especially love how these kinds of interactions require virtually no extra effort. “It's built in such a simple way. If you invite someone, and you both say, ‘Yes, let's share activity,’ it works with you, and you don't have to do much,” says Blahnik. “When you do a workout, I get notified. I can send you a message. When I get a badge, you get notified. You can send me a message. It's designed to be really lightweight, but really connected.” And then there are the myriad ways outside of activity sharing that Apple Watch makes connection easier—like its ability to reply to a text, take a call, or send a voice note right from your wrist during a workout. And this is to say nothing of what this product can do beyond fitness, which is, of course,a lot.“It's really lovely that the same watch you can use to pay for your coffee and do your first marathon can also take an ECG,” says Blahnik. “Whatever you might enjoy using it for, it can still be there as a guardian for your health.”",

    "title": "Manscaped Chairman Pro Review 2025: This Shaver Gave My Beard the CEO Treatment",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. I'm quite proud of mybeard. I rarely shave it off completely as I'm so in love with it. I also hate how I look when I shave it all off, but for the sake of experimentation, I'm willing to make the sacrifice. Sort of. I tested out the Manscaped Chairman Proshaverfor two weeks, and while I tried as hard as possible to retain my facial fuzz, I found myself enjoying it so much that it's now replaced myPhilips Series 9000 trimmerfor detailing and stubble management. I've tested a few of Manscaped's wacky roster of trimming tools, from the Beard Hedger to the LawnMower 5.0body hair trimmer, and find the brand has a number of quality options for most men's grooming concerns. The Chairman Pro is a bulky unit designed for skin-safe shaving and, through my testing, I've got very few complaints. MANSCAPED Amazon Manscaped To get the gripes out of the way first, the Chairman Pro is a pretty chunky boy. It feels more like a retro microphone than a lithe shaver, and that could turn off a few people. It's fully waterproof, so usable in the shower or by the sink, but I felt the bulk and weight make it a bit of a chore to use freely. The reason for its size is twofold: firstly, the four-blade foil strip is thicker and longer than many other shavers I've used, including Braun's huge Series 9 Pro. This is excellent, though, for the overall speed of shaving, as you get more coverage to slice through unwanted stubble in rapid time. The foil head is articulated, flexing and bending slightly to accommodate your jaw's ridges. I enjoyed the range of motion you can achieve here, as it allowed me to be a bit cavalier once I got comfortable with the device, slicing along my cheeks and neckline without having to consider the points of my chin or beneath my ears. If you'd prefer a more rigid shave, you can lock the head into place and take a more considered approach. In that regard, it's one of the fastest and most comfortable shavers I've tested. Blessedly, I suffered through noirritationor nicked skin throughout testing, which should quell any skin-safe fears you may have of its blades, and it also hides a pop-up beard trimmer to cut down longer sections of your beard along your cheek or underneath your neck to get that perfect edge. MANSCAPED Amazon Manscaped The second reason for its considerable girth is the battery. As with all Manscaped products, its USB-C recharging port is an absolute blessing for anyone who travels. You can pop it into your laptop charger or, if you have one of Apple or Samsung's fancy new smartphones, you can use the same charging cable to top it up. You're always aware of the charge available thanks to the LCD screen that gives the percentage remaining, though in my test, this didn't seem incredibly accurate, as the battery amount fluctuated fairly wildly between uses. USB-C is rapid, giving you full battery back within a few hours, and it can last a total of 75 minutes of continuous shaving. Our stubble doesn't require that level of scrutiny, but if you intended to use the shaver as a body hair tool, then you could do the full gamut of your torso and below in one charge. To aid you in this endeavor, it features an LED light to illuminate the path ahead to those tricky bits that don't often see the sunshine. I didn't test trimming below the neck through my review, but I can see the value in the Chairman Pro's features. However, I would point back to its bulk, which could prove a bit tricky when shaving around those delicate areas that require precision. Finally, the price seems reasonable at $100 considering all the features available. It is a pretty competitive price point compared to its rivals, like theBraun Series 9 Pro+'s $400 or thePanasonic ES-LS9A's $500 price tag. Of course, those devices have self-cleaning charging docks or longer batteries to justify that price. Overall, I really liked theChairman Prothe second I got over its hefty figure. It's big, but considering you do get the behemoth battery with rapid recharging and the broad shaver head and beard trimmer, there's not much this shaver can't tackle for most men. For anyone who shaves clean regularly or would like to take their beard edges a bit more seriously, this shaver offers some of the best value for money and enough versatility to adapt to your needs. A full chin shave? Consider it done. Tidy up your cheeks or neckline? It's a master of detailing. Hoping to explore manscaping below the neck? You're covered. All for $160? Given the industry's penchant for pricey, hyper-specialized devices, finding a shaver like the Chairman Pro that can do it all is refreshing. This story originally appeared onBritish GQ.",

    "title": "Neil Armstrong’s Gold Speedmaster Just Sold for $2.1 Million",
    "article_text": "Update 4/23/25:Neil Armstrong's former Omega, which he received to commemorate the moon landing, is now the most expensive Speedmaster in history. After dozens of online bids that culminated in a live sale, the watch sold for $2.1 million. If you’re anOmegadiehard, you better start rifling through the couch cushions, because you’re gonna need every spare penny: Neil Armstrong’s solid-goldOmega Speedmasterref. BA145.022—one of just 28 pieces made for NASA astronauts and personnel—is coming under the hammer for the first time, with a tidy estimated sale price of $2 million. Presented by RR Auctions Live in Cambridge, MA, on April 17, the auction is sure to be a sensation. Expect bidding by interested private parties, super-collectors, and Omega itself. The story goes something like this: Back in 1969,Omegaproduced the 28 Speedies in question and presented them to NASA astronauts at a gala dinner in Houston in November of that year. (President Richard Nixon and Vice President Spiro T. Agnew were offered two of the watches but had to decline the gift.) Each watch featured an inscribed caseback, with Armstrong’s reading thusly: “Astronaut Neil A. Armstrong, to mark man’s conquest of space with time, through time, on time, Gemini 8, Apollo 8, No. 17.” (The quip about being “on time”—especially given President Kennedy’s insistence that man make it to the Moon by the end of the 1960s—is particularly fun.) This is not, to be clear, one of the NASA-issued stainless steelSpeedmastersthat were worn on the Moon—or, in Armstrong’s case, left in the lunar module as a backup. (Buzz Aldrin’s watch was lost while in transit to NASA, and Armstrong’s is on display at the Smithsonian.) But the fact that this particular watch was given as a gift by Omega to the first man to walk on the Moon has the potential to add a serious premium over similar examples that have come under the hammer recently: Fellow astronaut Michael Collins’ watch hammered for $765,000 in 2022, and Walter “Wally” Schirra’s achieved $1.9 million that same year. Schirra was the first NASA astronaut to wear a Speedmaster in space, but Armstrong's name and legend arguably eclipse this notable horological event. Mark Armstrong, Neil’s son, noted that his father enjoyed wearing the watch on special occasions, and indeed it appears well loved, with a scratched bezel and a gouged caseback. Furthermore, part of the sale’s proceeds will be donated to causes important to Armstrong. It’s anyone’s guess as to whether the watch will achieve its estimate…or rocket past it into deep space. A testament to the enterprising spirit of post-War America—and Switzerland, for that matter—Armstrong’s watch evokes strong feelings of pride for many, especially those who were lucky enough to hear him utter those now-famous words on television in the summer of 1969. Here’s hoping Omega raises its own paddle, for one is reminded of those famous words of Indiana Jones: “It belongs in a museum!”",

    "title": "11 Best Slides for Men 2025, According to GQ Editors",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. It used to be that the best slides for men were only meant for two places: the beach or the home. But as we as a society have grown more mature (debatable) and accepting of exposed toes (not debatable), slides have become not only acceptable but celebrated. At last, the final footwear frontier is being explored. Count it as an alley-oop fromloafersandmules. It’s prime time for slides to come off the bench and into your starting lineup because they’ve evolved far beyond the homestead into all sorts of sick styles. From trail-seeking variants equipped with gravel-grabbing tread to artisanally-crafted leather luxuries and all the slides between, there’s a version for every style tribe. Whether you call them chanclas, tsinelas, or just, uh, slides, we shuffled around the market for the very best so you can step into the warm season with your hottest fits. Birkenstock SSENSE Zappos Birkenstock knows quality comfortable footwear like Planters knows nuts, so it’s no surprise that the iconic German brand makes our favorite version of a style predicated almost entirely upon comfort. The brand’s Kyoto Slide is essentially a simplified and reinforced iteration of theZurich model, with one updated detail that stands out above the rest: the adjustable velcro strap, which comes in incredibly clutch for a custom fit. “It's not surprising to me that the brand that literally invented the footbed makes an incredibly comfortable slide,” style commerce writer Gerald Ortiz says. The sandal is currently available in dozens of colors and seasonal styles. It also has Birkenstock’s classic suede-lined cork footbed and a hardy rubber outsole. Run ‘em with or without socks, with shorts or pants, as your corner-store steppers or something a little more formal. They can handle pretty much anything. For more, check out our guide onthe best Birkenstocks. Adidas Zappos Amazon For less than the price of an exceptionally affordable DoorDash order, you can own perhaps the most iconic, historically significant slide in the entire canon. Introduced in 1972, the Adidas Adilette hasn’t changed much since then—there’s still a quick-drying upper, suction pads on the sole to prevent slipping on wet surfaces, a contoured footbed, and that unmistakable three stripes design. “They're the perfect slide for lazy days and poolside hangs,” Ortiz says, “they're comfy, lightweight, and, crucially, waterproof.” It’s worth noting that while we recommend the Aquas, there’s also theAdilette Comfort slides, which aren’t waterproof but have a softer foam cushioned footbed. However, the Aquas don’t lack in comfort thanks to a nice update: The strap now has a little jelly in it, for added comfort and improved security. All killer, a little filler. OOFOS REI Nordstrom Amazon When it comes to recovery sandals, we think you can do no better than the Oofos Ooahh slides. They're a longtime favorite here at GQ thanks to the brand's patented EVA footbed that absorbs 37% more shock than your garden-variety EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate, which is what most plush slides are made from). The curvature of the sole and footbed also creates something of a natural cradle, which lightens the load on your feet. Out of all the slides we tested for this guide, the Ooahh slides offered the most arch support while being incredibly cushioned and stable. “They feel like wearing a foot massage,” Ortiz says. Simply put, they’re lighter, softer and more ergonomic than any other slide we slide into, and they'll make your feet feel great even after the hardest of sweat sessions. Todd Snyder Todd Snyder In our previous iteration of this article, we reviewed the Nomad slides and were really impressed with the overall quality from the materials to the construction to the attention-to-detail. While we still stand by those slides, it looks like Todd Snyder may or may not be shelving the style. At the very least, they’re on sale and sizing is sparse. That said, if Todd Snyder’s manufacturing has stayed consistent, we also like theupdated version of the Nomadwhich features more coverage, as well as theCrossover Nomad sandals, a variant of the original Nomad which features two overlapping straps rather than a single piece of leather. If you didn’t think slides could clean up, may we introduce you to the Nomad Slides. The product ofapproachable menswear patron saintTodd Snyder, the Nomads feature a super-textured suede strap that flows right into a suede-wrapped molded foam footbed, and all of that sits atop a long-lasting EVA outsole. When taken together, what you get is a gorgeous sandal that will look just as distinguished at the beach with some shorts as it will at dinner with some flowy slacks. Hermès Hermès Gucci may have the name drop on several rap tracks, but there’s no doubt that Hermès slides are the ultimate designer slides. Handcrafted in the Hermès atelier in France, these slides are understated but still send out a clear message: I’m rich, bro. Or at least, you have a sophisticated palate for the finer things of life. Designer slides come in and out of vogue, but since this is Hermès we’re talking about, you know they’ll always be in. Teva Amazon Adventure slides exist? Better believe it. And Teva’s are, unsurprisingly, our favorite of the bunch. Equipped with an adjustable strap system and a quick-drying upper to lock your foot in during more strenuous activity, these also have an off-road approved outsole with a shank running through it for stability purposes. Are there better shoes for the tough stuff? Of course, an entire category is built upon the pursuit. But if you’re looking for one that’s easy to get in and out of, impossibly lightweight and completely unafraid of water, these are world-class. Will they cruise a Class 3 scramble? We wouldn’t advise trying, but if you’re on a trail, they’re plenty of shoe. Crocs Amazon Hoka REI Hoka Nike Nike Keen Nordstrom Salomon SSENSE King Kennedy Rugs Todd Snyder While slides are a pretty pared-down concept, there are still some things to consider when zoning in on a pair. Here’s what we think about when we’re scouting for ours: Intended use.We tend to start here. While plenty of slides are adept in multiple disciplines, if you have a use-case in mind—the gym, summer hikes, or the beach, for example—lead with that. Most slides are, indeed, relatively similar, but that doesn’t mean that all of them will deliver the same ride or handle the same elements or work with every outfit. Materials.If you’re looking for something you can wear in or near water (or after the gym or sauna), you’ll want to prioritize rubber, nylon and other materials that don’t degrade or get waterlogged or crack when exposed to consistent moisture. If you’re trying to find something that wouldn’t feel out of place at dinner, leather, suede, cork and other materials that are found on more traditional footwear will play far better than rubber ones. Construction.When it comes to molded rubber footwear, there’s only so much variance possible between models, but that doesn’t mean that the addition of a strap, the width of straps or the way those straps are attached are afterthoughts. And if they’re not molded, then all the same rules that apply to regular footwear apply to slides—how are the soles affixed to the upper, is it stitched or glued, etc. Style is subjective, we know—that’s the fun of it. But we’re serious about helping our audience get dressed. Whether it’s thebest white sneakers, the flyestaffordable suits, or the need-to-knowmenswear drops of the week, GQ Recommends’ perspective is built on years of hands-on experience, an insider awareness of what’s in and what’s next, and a mission to find the best version of everything out there, at every price point. Our staffers aren’t able to try on every single piece of clothing you read about on GQ.com (fashion moves fast these days), but we have an intimate knowledge of each brand’s strengths and know the hallmarks of quality clothing—from materials and sourcing, to craftsmanship, to sustainability efforts that aren’t just greenwashing. GQ Recommends heavily emphasizes our own editorial experience with those brands, how they make their clothes, and how those clothes have been reviewed by customers. Bottom line: GQ wouldn’t tell you to wear it if we wouldn’t. We make every effort to cast as wide of a net as possible, with an eye on identifying the best options across three key categories:quality,fit, andprice. To kick off the process, we enlist the GQ Recommends braintrust to vote on our contenders. Some of the folks involved have worked in retail, slinging clothes to the masses; others have toiled for small-batch menswear labels; all spend way too much time thinking about what hangs in their closets. We lean on that collective experience to guide our search, culling a mix of household names, indie favorites, and the artisanal imprints on the bleeding-edge of the genre. Then we narrow down the assortment to the picks that scored the highest across quality, fit, and price. Across the majority of our buying guides, our team boasts firsthand experience with the bulk of our selects, but a handful are totally new to us. So after several months of intense debate, we tally the votes, collate the anecdotal evidence, and emerge with a list of what we believe to be the absolute best of the category right now, from the tried-and-true stalwarts to the modern disruptors, the affordable beaters to the wildly expensive (but wildly worth-it) designer riffs. Whatever your preferences, whatever your style, there's bound to be a superlative version on this list for you. (Read more about GQ's testing processhere.)",

    "title": "Carlos Alcaraz Adds Another Outrageous Rolex to His Collection",
    "article_text": "The Laureus Sport Awards always present a chance for A-list sports stars to link up in their biggest fits of the year. This year in Madrid,it was a thrill to see Carlos Alcarazhanging in the same circle asSimone Bilesand soccer superstars Lamine Yamal and Luka Modrić. Given the caliber of assorted talent in attendance—Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, and Kelly Slater were also there—you'd be right to assume there were a lot of grail-worthy watches on show. But Alcaraz's Rolex Daytona 116576TBR still stood out as he walked the red carpet. As Alcaraz fans will have become accustomed to spotting, the 21-year-oldlikes towearhis watches out in the wild. He is known for regularly giving pieces from his collection repeat airtimeat tournaments and red carpets. Case in point, last night at the Madrid premiere ofCarlos Alcaraz: My Way,theNetflixseries about his career to date, he wore the same Rollie that was on his wrist at the Laureus Sport Awards. That's two public wrist checks in a week, pushing the watch into elite daily driver territory. Fittingly, Alcaraz is at the top end of his game, and his watch is a seamless match. For starters, it’s crafted entirely from platinum and takes Rolex’s killer chrono to the next level with a tasty diamond-set bezel and ice-blue dial. Arabic numerals add to the collector appeal, given that Rolex produces these dials in small quantities, and they’re highly sought after (other legendary athletes,like Tom Brady, are big fans). Daytonas with this dial layout were produced for a very small, elite client list in the Middle East, so the chances of seeing them in the wild are pretty slim. Even for Alcaraz, who is knitted in with the Crown, getting this level of watch probably required some determination. He reps the Crown in an official capacity, so it wouldn’t have been a surprise to see himwearing the new Land-Dweller, whichfeatured as part of the brand’s 2025 releases. But there’s something extra special about pulling up with a rare take on the Daytona. The watch has been around since the ’60s and is considered one of the hardest Rollies to score (on the secondary market, this watch goes for well over $200k). Let alone a diamond-set, ultra-rare platinum edition that puts the brand's trademark prestige in turbo mode. It shows that he's a watch guy for real. He doesn't just go for the buzziest watches he can get, but likes to scour for the real gems and collector catnip that sets him apart from the rest. The level-up makes sense. Previously, he’s worn the gold Rolex Cosmograph Daytona ref. 116518LN-0076 for some pretty major moments, including lifting the men’s singles trophy at Wimbledon last year. So he’s got a taste for precious metals. But where his past Daytona came on a rubberized sporty band, his new platinum beast is an all-metal assassin. And when you consider platinum is one of the strongest, rarest, and densest precious metals, it makes for a very sick daily driver. Carlos Alcaraz isn’t the kind of guy to wear a new watch every week. He likes to carry his good form into all of his decision-making, and thus consistently picks killer Rollie grails that he rocks again and again. And with the French Open andWimbledonon the horizon, a rare, all-platinum Daytona is a winning choice if we’ve ever seen one. This story originally appeared onBritish GQ.",

    "title": "Your Righteous Gemstones Final-Season Draft Board, Week 7",
    "article_text": "TheNFLDraft, which begins this Thursday, is all about evaluating talent. Is a given football prospect rising towards the pinnacle of their best selves? Have they plateaued, or are they falling from the summit and bound for disappointment? Despite what Mel Kiper would have you believe, only the Lord above truly knows who will rise or fall. We know this, because we talk to them every Sunday night at the Church of Prepackaged Fajita Meat, a.k.a. HBO’sThe Righteous Gemstones, the raunchiest and yet holiest testimonial to the importance of teamwork currently on streaming television. That team’s own prospects are currently seven segments deep into a combine of the soul.With only twoRighteous Gemstonesepisodes remaining, we’ve evaluated their dash times, their vertical leaps, and most importantly, their character, in an effort to properly project their spots in the most important draft of all: Life. (Or whatever passes for premium cable these days. Same thing.) KELVIN GEMSTONE (Adam Devine).We see you, Top Christ-Following Man. We see you, andHesees you. Let’s check off Kelvin’s streak of recent Ws: Living his truth out loud AND giving his partner the public validation their relationship has been kinda wilting without! Appears to be building an affirming community for himself rather than chasing solo stardom (Judy) or his parents’ legacy (Jesse)! Has a sick treehouse! Executed the sickest strategic gambit of the entire season by pre-applying his makeup before the Night Of Testimony so he could get the best seat on stage! Sneaking up quietly as maybe the actual lead dog preacher the Gemstones have been lacking since Eli’s retirement! Honestly, we all should have known he was bound for greatness when we saw him eating Bugles off his fingers. A pro’s pro. GIDEON GEMSTONE (Skyler Gisondo).Such a tour de force performance from the first-born third-gen Gemstone this week that slotting him in second place feels patently unfair. No, if it hadn’t been for Kelvin snatching a televised victory from the jerky-tanned jaws of Vance Simkins, Gideon would be number one by a comfortable margin here. That might seem like recency bias! There’s a lot of lustrous accomplishments up and down this list. But who else here can say theySHREDDED THEIR WAY INTO THE HEARTS OF A CADRE OF DISAFFECTED YOUTHS, FOR THE LORD? Nobody. NOBODY. (As to his actual vocation: There’s something ball-runnish to how he’s approaching his desire to be a preacher. He’s not GOOD, but he’s gaining inches, and those turn into yards with time and grind.) JESSE GEMSTONE (Danny McBride).“Quietly” is not a term that has ever found much purchase when describing the actions, words, or wardrobe of the eldest child of Eli, but here’s another Gemstone boy sneaking up on what may be his true purpose: Pulling all the strings behind the scenes, just so. In the most recent episode alone, he can be seen nuking rival Vance Simkins by boosting Kelvin at the TCFM Awards, heeding Amber’s advice for-fucking-once and in doing so indirectly wrangling Pontius back into the fold via Gideon, and valiantly trying to rein in a powerfully coked-up Baby Billy. Dare we say it: Kiiiind of a series of political triumphs for Jesse? He might be a big daddy after all! Intangibles are high as well: He appeared much more comfortable operating a jetpack this time around, and at all times and no matter the occasion, he is DRESSING. KEEFE (Tony Cavalero).Still the umbrella over Kelvin’s head, shielding him from the hot piss of the Devil himself – and it’s working for him. Nobody in the Gemstones’ orbit has risen further over the past four years than this sweet-hearted service top. Let’s hear it for Keefe: He’s come a long way since his humble days of house sitting and gazing longingly at Kelvin, and has also made it this far into the fold while being completely himself, a book from which a couple of other spouses of Gemstones might take a few pages! All while still sleeping upside-down wrapped in a cocoon of his own wings AND staying humble: No, don’t you mindKeefe, just over here holding up half the sky for what’s become the most unassailable relationship on the show. JACOB JONES (Steve Little).Look, we're not even sure he’ll ever be back again after last week, butwhata spot to deploy a McBride Players special teams all-star like Little. WithWhite Lotussunsetted, he’s here to hike his hairline up to the heavensandclaim the HBO Sunday evening throne of Sunday’s most inexplicably intoxicating accent—and he’s fresh out of Dippity-Do. BIG GUS (An Alligator).Got fedandset up for a near-certain triumphant return as Chekhov’s Gator. Huge week for Big Gus. One to watch. PONTIUS GEMSTONE (Kelton DuMont).Captured in episode 7 in a crystalline moment of perfect balance. The stats tell the story: Did whippits at church: +100 Got busted by his extremely uncool family in front of friends: -100 Shown up by his brother absolutely shredding in front of his friends -100 Extended a hand to said brother and healed a painful family rift in doing so: +100 BJ (Tim Baltz).At first glance, nothing but open field in front of him, a tremendous accomplishment in itself after taking the season’s most ignominious physical hit. Scored what may very well end up being the line reading of the season (another incredible feat, given the company he’s in) based on the words “prepackaged fajita meat” alone. May have finally found the one soul in the world who knows his true worth. Unfortunately, that soul inhabits the form of his newly acquired service monkey, Dr. Watson. Also unfortunately, it’s draft time, and at draft time we tell the truth: We’re not sure it’s possible for anybody to come out ahead of the massive psychic debt you place on the ledger by marrying Judy in the first place. TIFFANY FREEMAN (Valyn Hall).Has spent most of this season watching her husband disintegrate, but looks fantastic so let’s call it a draw? Potential upside: May have been late to theTeenjusshoot because she was making love to the Freemans’ terrifying Teutonic nanny. Which, to be clear, she deserves to do if she likes. DR. WATSON (A Capuchin Monkey).An unlikely late-blooming success story displaying a number of signs he came to compete, not the least of which involves setting clearly delineated personal boundaries (in this case, staking his territory out in the boudoir by winging loose fajita meat at Judy). Cannot imagine a deeper betrayal to a child of evangelicals than getting attacked by the foundational protein of every strip mall Texican feast. Is the only cast member this season to have their ass washed on camera to date. His biggest red flag, however, seems likely to be his undoing: He’s gone and made an enemy of Judy, on purpose. There’s showboating, and then there’s outright death-wishing. COBB MILSAP (Michael Rooker).Has the least clothes on, a generally accepted indicator ofwho wields the most power in any given episode of the Gemstones. He’s pretty clearly determined to squander this momentum, but at least he might be eaten by an alligator when it happens. (He’s gonna at least lose a limb to Big Gus.) AMBER GEMSTONE (Cassidy Freeman).Injury-prone to a degree that remains concerning to evaluators, Amber is still recuperating from burns sustained via an STFU from Eli, one so vicious it dented her whole season. Recouped some of her credit by pulling Jesse’s strings in turn, in getting him to set a positive example for Gideon by cheering up Kelvin. Devastated all onlookers in a pantsuit, as sure a sign as there is that Amber may yet make a full recovery. JUDY GEMSTONE (Edi Patterson).Let the distance on this board between Judy and her two brothers, all of them noted and inveterate dipshits, serve as a dire warning: In an episode where the mostly useless Gemstone children band together to forge a victory out of thin air and Aqua Net, Judy sticks out even more for being uniquely useless in a crisis. Is currently getting outplayed on her home court by a fajita meat-tossing monkey. Outflanked in the line-reading department by her own husband, where in a lesser episode “I’m merely shitting” might have vaulted her into memetic hall-of-famer territory. Did successfully use a jetpack, which is something. BABY BILLY FREEMAN (Walton Goggins).Has exitedFun Cocaine Hoursand taken a convenient off-ramp toCocaine Cocaine Hours. Has recast himself in the titular role in his budget-strapped teen Jesus television drama. Doesnotlook like a teenager. Is, it’s worth mentioning again, clearly on the verge of putting all of his Bible Bonkers Bucks straight up his nose. May have allowed his own sweaty financial anxiety to cripple his marriage, and is still visibly allergic to all children including his own. Otherwise: KILLING IT. VANCE SIMKINS (Stephen Dorff).FRIED BEFORE THE EYES OF THE LORD. Positively washed. Exploring heretofore unknown depths of being boilt alive, an achievement of some significance for a man whose skin currently resembles nothing so much as a gas station hot dog dipped in paraffin wax. Ate all sassy-like off Jesse’s plate at the Cape and Pistol Society to build an early lead, only to find himself rebuked for his homophobia in front of the only room full of people he cares about impressingandexposed as a seafood hater in coastal South Carolina. I’d die. I’d dietwice. LORI MILSAP (Megan Mullally).It’s been tough sledding for an early-season favorite. Miz Lori’s shouldering twin home losses as she simultaneously deals with a lunatic ex who’s a touch too familiar with alligators and larceny for anyone’s complete comfort, and her current boyfriend, who’s shut her out for her alleged era spent as a pillar of the mature ladies service industry of Pigeon Forge, Tennessee (NB for the Yankees: real place, Dollywood’s there). Still breaking hearts left and right with that one lonesome streak of gray across the front. DR. ELI GEMSTONE (John Goodman).Spiraling in a bad way, and his latest loss is self-inflicted regardless of its genesis: Whether he’s been fooled by Cobb’s cheap-ass forgery of an Appalachian tourist town escort ad OR forgotten that Jesus hung out with sex workers and considered them as worthy of God’s love as anyone else … yeesh, Padre. Get your shit together.",

    "title": "David Beckham: “I Turned Around to Victoria and Said, ‘Do I Need to Dress a Little Bit Cooler?’”",
    "article_text": "When you’re David Beckham, the grind never stops. Even if that means shooting a campaign for hours outside in the pouring Miami rain. “My goodness. It’s not just rainy, it’s torrential,” Beckham told me by phone earlier this month, once he’d escaped to the comfort of a dry car. “It’s okay. Could be worse. At least it’s warm.” Nothing like the sunshine and blue skies Beckham encountered when he shot the campaign for his debut menswear collaboration with the German label Boss, which drops today. Last May, the soccer legend signed a multiyear design deal to create clothing that would emulate his signature personal style, which the 49-year-old admitshas mellowed outover the last decade. The debut Boss x Beckham collection reflects his contemporary fondness for smart English suiting and easygoing casualwear, with linen kits in navy and khaki, soft tees and trousers, and even a spin on the baker boy cap, one ofthe Beckhams’ many hats of choice. (The capsule was preceded by Beckham’s Boss One bodywear campaign, which, when it droppedin January, featured images so steamy that they inspired David’s wife, Victoria Beckham,to caption onewith “My boss” on Instagram.) Ahead of the launch, Beckham and I chatted about his style evolution, his longtime love of tailoring, and the one ’90s outfit his kids can’t stop asking him about. David Beckham: To be honest, I’ve always really looked to get into, not the fashion industry, but in a way where I don’t have to do so much similar to my wife, because my wife, she’s full in. Everything that she does withher brand, she does everything, whereas I obviously have a different business. I havemultiplethingsthat I’m doing, so I wanted something where I could jump into a great company with a great history, and create a collection that eventually I will design. At the moment, it’s a collaboration, but working with Boss has been incredible. When they first approached me about the idea, I was quite excited about it because I’ve been looking for some kind of tailoring collaboration. And then when I sat down with [CEO] Daniel Grieder, I loved his vision. I loved where he wanted to take it. I love where he wanted to go with it, and the commitment also to what we wanted to do as well. It was a real collaboration, because he listened to me, I listened to him. I worked well with his team, they’ve worked well with my team, and really, that’s how it all started. And then he told me, “Okay, but we are going to have to do a bodywear campaign.” And I was like, “Really? I’m almost 50. I wasn’t planning on getting back into my underwear again publicly.” But he said, “Well, this is what we want to do.” And I said, “Okay, well, give me 14 weeks. I’m going to train for it.” And then, yeah, we did it. It’s been good so far. Well, I always train anyway, so there’s a good foundation there. But if I was going to do it—if I wanted to get back in my underwear at 50 years old—I wanted to go all out and make sure that I was tip-top shape. I did a 14-week [diet of] no carbs, no bread, no butter, no pasta, no pizzas, no alcohol, and just trained like crazy for 14 weeks. Because I knew what Boss were putting into this, and I knew I would be working with [photographers] Mert and Marcus again, so it was a real team effort to get back into real good shape and to do the best campaign. “If I wanted to get back in my underwear at 50 years old, I wanted to go all out,” says Beckham of his Boss One bodywear campaign, which dropped in January. I think obviously, being from England, we’ve gota rich historyof tailoring, and it’s something that I’ve always loved. I have averyparticularaestheticthese days. It’s all very classic styles and timeless looks, and understated more than anything else. It’s a very classic style that I’ve been working with with the Boss team. Obviously, for this collection, it being spring-summer ’25, there’s some greatlinen suitsin there, which will be perfect for the summer. Those are actually some of my favorite items. We did a navy linen suit and we did a beige linen suit. We did a pink knit T-shirt that was nice and very, veryappropriate for Miami. But on the tailoring, I’ve always loved wearing suits. I like to dress casual. I love a great T-shirt and a pair of jeans, but I also love to dress up. I love to wear well-tailored suits, so we’ve worked very hard with how my aesthetic and my [preferred] fit is slightly different to what some of the Boss items are, so we’ve just kind of adjusted and worked with the team and it seems to have gone down well. I think since I started to get a little bit older, in all honesty. I think gone are the days where I’d be too daring. I think I’ll leave that to my kids.My sons are quite daring in what they wear, but my aesthetic is really kind of classic now. It’s very understated. So that probably was, I’d say, 10 years ago, maybe 15 years ago, I just started to kind of dress a little bit more understated. I suppose these days, the only things that I push the boundaries on is I’ve made a wide-leg trouser, an oversized trouser for one of the suits. So, that’s my way of pushing the boundaries, and actually doing something different to what I usually do. I was probably about eight years old, funnily enough, and I was part of a soccer team in the UK that every time that we turned up in a game, our coach would make us turn up in a blazer, which wasn’t the normal thing to do. But actually, it set me up for my whole career, because atManchester United, you were only allowed to turn up in games in a blazer. So it started early. Funnily enough, a lot of my teammates weren’t, but I actually loved the fact that we wore blazers. It’s strange because my dad never really wore suits when I was a young kid. It wasn’t something that I got from him. I think it was actually my granddad. My granddad was always well turned-out. Yeah, I think that especially living in the UK, you see a lot of young kids now going out and actually making more of an effort. In the UK, I’ve got a lot of kids of my friends that go out in full double-breasted suits, shirts and ties and nice shoes, and one of my sons is like that. My youngest son, Cruz, loves to wear a smart suit. He loves to wear a smart suit when he’s just going down the pub, and those things date back to 50 years ago or 100 years ago when people actually used to make more of an effort. These days with social media, they see so much of the past, and they’re always referencingmy looks from the ’90sand saying, “Dad, do you still have these jeans? Because I want to wear these jeans. They’re back in now.” So I think we’ve influenced them on that side purely because they see so much of us and how we used to dress. I mean, I supposethe leather outfitis one that continues to come up. None of my kids have actually tried to copy it yet, but they’ve mentioned multiple times that they love that look. What I love about my kids is they’ve all got their sense of style, and they’ve all got their take on what looks good and what feels good, and that’s what I love about my kids and their style. They’re willing to take a risk. They’re willing to do something different, and they’re not scared about it. They’re not self-conscious about wearing something different. They’ll wear it because they like it, not just because it’s the trend. We’re very lucky with our kids on that side. Like I said about Cruz’s taste, he’s verydandy. He likes to wear a double-breasted plaid suit. Romeo,he loves the Balenciaga style, the oversized things.Brooklyn’s quite classic. Harper’s like her mum. She’s quite understated and low-key, Harper. She doesn’t wear things that are too much. She’s very, very, very kind of understated. To be honest, I always think about what I’m wearing ahead of time, even sometimes a week ahead of time. I’m always planning. I know exactly what I’m wearing every single day, and it very rarely changes. On the design side, it’s more of a collaboration than me going in there and being the designer, but I know what I like. I feel that I know what people like and what guys want to wear. Whether they’re 18 or 28 or 50 or 70, I feel that the collection really hits all those different ages. It’s built into my daily life because I actually care what I wear. We were talking about it the other day [when] I turned around to Victoria and said, “Do you think I need to dress a little bit cooler?” And she said, “Well, you are cool because you don’t really make an effort. You make an effort in a discreet way, rather than it being kind of fake, like you’re trying to be cool. You’re not trying to be cool, so it actually makes you cool.” It’s very good advice, and she’s always right. She’s always right. It’s a problem. Yeah, I know, I know. That’s what she keeps telling me. Definitely by the water. I would say by the water in Italy somewhere, with the kids, with Victoria, going out to one of my favorite lunch places. I think that would be the perfect evening to wear one of the linen suits. I would have to say as much pasta as possible. I love pasta, and any kind of seafood, and meat. I love meat. Victoria loves seafood. And some kind of maybe ... I don’t know. You know in Italy when they do that amazing vanilla ice cream with the dark cherries on the top? That would be [ideal] for me. Yeah. I like the sound of that. And I’m going to wear the Boss suit and everything that comes with it. This interview has been edited and condensed.",

    "title": "Jayson Tatum Talks the NBA Playoffs, His Relationship with Joe Mazzulla, and the Player Whose Closet He Wants to Raid",
    "article_text": "Jayson Tatum, like a lot of Gen Zers, is big on manifesting. “When I was a kid, I always dreamed really big,” the Boston Celtics star forward tells me. “I wanted to be the best player in the world. I wantedmy own shoe. I wanted championships. I would try and speak it into existence. And like, I really believed it. I didn’t hope for it. I believed it would happen.” One of those childhood dreams, he recalls, took shape as he flipped through magazines in his dentist’s waiting room. “I’d see theseGQmagazines and they’d have all my favorite athletes and movie stars and I thought, ‘Oh, this is the pinnacle. If you’re in here, this is how you know you’re big time.’” Of course, Tatum—the man that NBA Twitter callsThe Anomaly—was big time long before thisGQinterview. Now in his eighth NBA season, the 27-year-old is a six-time All-Star, a three-time All-NBA first team selection, and, as of last June, a one-time NBA champion. Since entering the league in the 2017-18 season, the rangy 6-foot-8 forward’s Celtics have never missed the playoffs—a feat that none ofSteph Curry, Kevin Durant, LeBron James, or Kawhi Leonard can lay claim to in that stretch—and they’re currently in the hunt for a second consecutive title, matched up in the first round with the upstart Orlando Magic. “It doesn’t matter who you play,” Tatum says. “Winning in the NBA is hard.” When I reach Tatum via Zoom, he’s only a few days out from the playoffs. If he’s feeling any serious pressure to repeat, however, it doesn’t show—he’s loose and easy in conversation. Maybe it’s simply because right now, so much seems to be going Tatum’s way. On top of another dominant season—with the Celtics cruising to a 61-21 record, good enough for second in the Eastern Conference—he’s now the face of Coach’s latest cologne, Eau de Parfum for Men. Tatum has been a Coach ambassador since last summer. The label, he says, fits his personality. “It’s not really alook-at-mebrand,” he says, “Like, I’ve always been laid back, yeah? But I enjoy nicer things.” His personal history with the brand stretches all the way back to his childhood, when he received a Coach money clip for his 10th birthday. “I knew then that my parents and grandparents, they all had wallets,” he recalls. “So I remember getting this money clip, and even at that age, it made me [feel] closer to [being] an adult.” When Tatum gets dressed, it’s always sensible and composed—beyond the occasionalpastel-splashed Richard Mille watch. He looks good and stylish, but not in a way that feels desperate to attract @LeagueFits attention. “I’m always just trying to feel comfortable,” he says. “I’ve always found a lot of importance in how I present myself—of how to dress, of making sure you get your hair cut. I used to think about these things all the time in elementary school, in middle school, in high school.” He admits to trying to follow trends earlier in his career, but as he’s become more at ease in the league, his style has followed. Over time, he took note of the way other players he admired dressed and began—like all great artists and tunnel fit guys—to steal. “You know, I maybe didn’t like the way they dressed from head to toe,” Tatum explains. “But there were certain pieces or certain things that made me go, ‘Oh, I want to steal that.’” When I ask which other NBA player’s wardrobe he would raid, he namesKevin Loveso fast that I’m forced to wonder if he’s really considered goingOcean’s Elevenon the Miami Heat center’s Ralph Lauren-filled closet. As with all things in his life, there’s a level of practicality behind Tatum’s answer: “We’re, like, the same size.” We run through a few of his favorite playoff moments pre-title run, and it’s full of the sort of highlights most players would kill to notch evenoneof on their resumé. “My first year playing against LeBron and the Cavs was incredible,” he says. “But the playoff run in 2022 was special. We went through Kyrie and KD, the defending champs [the Bucks] in seven, and then we beat the Heat in Game 7 in the Conference Finals.” He chuckles. “And I would say playing against the Sixers in 2023, being down 3-2, and then scoring 51 in Game 7 to go to the Conference Finals.” Those highs all came before he ever got a ring. That changed last year, when Boston finally put all the pieces together and turned in as dominant a postseason performance as we’ve seen in some time. It’s no surprise that this year—in a season featuring titanic runs by the Oklahoma City Thunder and Cleveland Cavaliers—the Celtics are still the safe money bet for the NBA title. “Last year really helped me understand the importance of a team,” Tatum says. “The guys in the back, the strength coaches, the security. I have a much higher level of appreciation for everybody and for what it took for us to accomplish something special. I don’t take those things for granted. We’re all bonded for life for what we did last year.” If there’s another X-factor that Tatum believes shouldn’t be overlooked in assessing the Celtics’ title chances, it’s head coach Joe Mazzulla. “He’s the best coach in the NBA, even though he’ll never admit that,” Tatum says. Mazzulla’s brilliance as a play caller is sometimes overshadowed by his habit of droppingunintentionally hilarious one-liners in interviews, which Tatum admits the locker room gets a kick out of. “We laugh [about it],” he says. “Like, weloveto watch his press conferences.” I ask Tatum about his favorite thing Mazzulla has ever said to him. “He always tells me that he loves me,” he shares. “He’ll say it on practice days or in the middle of a game during a timeout. It’ll be the third quarter of a playoff game, a very intense atmosphere, and he’ll say ‘Just want you to know I love you, man.’” A few days after our call, the Celtics throttle the Magic in the opening game of their series. Anything can happen in the playoffs: maybe the Magic’s young core finds a way around Tatum’s Cs in the games to come; maybe the Celtics become the first NBA team to win back-to-back championships since the Golden State Warriors in 2018. There are no safe bets in the NBA, but Tatum may be the closest thing we have to one. No matter what happens in the next few weeks, he’ll almost certainly be back for more this time next year.",

    "title": "Pete Davidson Strongly Endorses AXE, 'The Sopranos,' and His Staten Island Ferry",
    "article_text": "Welcome back toStrongly Endorses, our occasional feature on the everyday things that celebrities are really into. If you see a white 2003 Cadillac Escalade ESV driving down Hylan Boulevard in Staten Island, there’s a good chancePete Davidsonis behind the wheel. The original owner of his car, however, was Tony Soprano. Yes,thatTony Soprano. Davidson, you see, has an affinity for buying things that make him feel nostalgic. “I think that’s what I’m trying to fill my life with more,” he says. “As we get older and when we’re working, what we’re working towards is just to bring back our childhood and things that make us happy.” The 31-year-old actor and comedian, who came up onSaturday Night Live, has been busy since he left the sketch show in 2022. When he’s not removing all 200 of histattoos(which he predicts won’t be done for the next five years), he’s renovating a defunct Staten Island ferry for fun. He’s been careful about doing brand endorsements and commercials—\"the slightest wrong move affects everything,\" he says—but a new partnership with AXE was a “no brainer” for him. The nostalgia factor helped. “I’ve been using this since I’ve been fucking 10 years old,” he says about AXE’s Phoenix, thebody spraythat’s been ubiquitous in high school hallways for the past quarter of a century. As part of this campaign, Davidson will take over the AXE Instagram on May 1 to offer fans advice as part of an AXE Me Anything segment, while a commercial spot starring the comedian titled “Short Kings” will drop on May 12. (This coincides with AXE’s release of two new scents, Cherry Spritz and Watermelon Freeze.) Along with his affinity for AXE,GQchatted with Davidson about his obsession with two specific categories of vintage clothing, his first (incorrect) experience withZyn, and why you gotta give him some time before you can hop on the Pete Davidson Staten Island Ferry. It brings back this nostalgic childhood—memories of playing basketball and having it in your backpack, being in school and not wanting to smell like shit, having a crush on a girl. I had so many bottles of Phoenix, the blue body spray. I had one in my mom’s car, one in my locker, one in my backpack, and basketball practice—anywhere I could store one. Of course I kept one intheSNLdressing roombecause, you know, you live there and you work there. It’s kind of like school where it’s like nine months of very intense work, and then you’re off for the summer. So my whole life was in my office. I had tons of AXE in there and spare clothes. And what’s funny is the second I left, they renovated the whole thing. And when I was there, it was the samesince 1975, so, you know, we needed to have lots of spray in there to make it fresh. If you’ve watched it, watch it again. If you haven’t watched it, what are you doing? There’s actually nothing better, and there never will be anything remotely as close to how perfect that show is. I’ve seen it over 25 times from front to back. I watch it twice a year, usually like February or March, and then I put on a couple episodes aroundChristmastime, because it’s kind of Christmassy to me. I don’t know why, probably [because it’s] family-oriented, and I just don’t think there will ever be as powerful of a performance as [James] Gandolfini as Tony. And obviously, you know, I love Edie [Editor’s note: Edie Falco played Davidson’s mom in his 2023 semi-autobiographical sitcomBupkis]. I’m obsessed and could say every word from every episode. Sometimes when I watch it with my friends, they’re just like, “You’re impossible to watch this with, because you’re just doing what they’re gonna say five seconds before it happens and it’s really frustrating.” I love the show so much. I have a pinball machine, and I have Tony’s actual Escalade that I got at auction, the one he drove in seasons four, five, and six. I think we’re all hoping David Chase just does it one more time. You know, whether it be a prequel or like postal—I don’t know what the fucking opposite of prequel is—but I think he’s got more in the tank. And I saw that documentary [Wise Guy] on HBO a couple months ago, and I’m really hoping that he feels like he wants to go at it again, because there’s just nothing like it. Every show is an utter disappointment in comparison. They’re on eBay somewhere. It’s what every mobster from the ’80s to 2005 wore, and they’re pretty great. I have probably 150 of them. I got them all on eBay. What’s left is what I left up there. I just think that vibe should be brought back: slacks, Alan Stuart shirt, leather jacket over it, halfdress shoe, half sneaker type vibe. Also, if you look atthe wardrobe inThe Sopranos, the shirts are fucking amazing—unreal. So I just think that vibe is really cool. It’s also from a time where things, and the world, were just better. Shameless plug: It’s coming sooner than you think. We just made some major headway. We have a whole floor done out of the four floors, and we’re using this floor that holds 1,000 people all summer for parties and throwing a bar in there. We’re going floor by floor. And we obviously have way more expensive plans, but right now, it’s where it’s moving. It’s just the three of us [Saturday Night Livecast member Colin Jost and The Stand comedy club owner Paul Italia] who have never owned a boat before. I know people like to shit on it, because they’ll shit on anything that a couple of Staten Island guys are trying to do. People don’t understand the fucking scope of this. Like, you can’t do this in a month—this is a 5- to 10-year plan before it’s fully done, and you just got to give us time. It’s been a year and a half, so we’re happy with it, and I’m on constant calls about it, and we’re really enjoying the process. There’s a million different problems, like, what is the curfew to stop serving alcohol on a boat? There are certain anchors that have to be in to stabilize it. There’s a million things that you would never think of, because you’re not supposed to buy a ferry from 1965. But we did, and now we’re here. 50 Centhad a Reebok sneaker from like 2003 to 2008 called G-Unit, and G-Unit is his group of rappers, and it was the coolest thing ever, and they’re really cool sneakers. They did a collab with theYankees, and they just had regular ones. Camo ones. It was a very cool thing. Smoking is gross, and I’m old now, so I can’t really smoke as many cigarettes anymore. So now I’mon Zynlike every frat guy. Shane Gillis gave me a bunch of them because he’s like “You should stop smoking cigarettes, dude,” as he was pounding 12 beers. [The first time I tried Zyn] I ate a whole pack. I swallowedallof them. I didn’t know that they weren’t swallow-able. And then Shane checked in and was like “Are you doing the Zyn?” And I go “Yeah, it’s weird you can just eat them.” And he goes, “You’re not supposed to eat them, but the first pack you have makes you burp and vomit a little bit. You just got to get past that.” I like coffee and I like the cinnamon [flavors]. I’m not a minty or fruit guy. I’m trying to just be on nicotine, and it’s a douchey thing, but it’s pretty great.",

    "title": "Ivanka Trump’s Vacation Beach Reads Include Titles Beloved By Anti-Trumpers, Including Oprah",
    "article_text": "The words “spring break” tend to conjure images of wild college trips, wet t-shirt contests, and phosphorescent drinks in sweating plastic cups. For parents of younger children, however, the week off is more often an opportunity to sit down, keep half an eye on the kids to make sure they don’t accidentally destroy themselves, and maybe read an Oprah’s Book Club selection or two. Judging byIvanka Trump’sInstagram photo dump on Tuesday, the latter was the vibe of her recent family vacation with husbandJared Kushnerand kidsArabella, 14,Joseph, 11, andTheodore, 9, to Costa Rica. Of the 18 photos and videos included in her carousel, just one slide does not feature the beach and/or a horse: a picture of her reading list. And, boy, is it interesting to read into her picks. In the post’s caption, in which she gushes about how “grateful” she is for the trip (the word “doesn’t begin to cover it,” she insists), Trump describes “logging off and tuning in. Grounding in nature’s rhythm. Feeling the sacred in the silence, in the laughter of my children, in the breath of the trees.” Ivanka also, in her own words, “read until the sun dipped low.” Three favorites are arrayed on a bedspread:Tomorrow and Tomorrow and TomorrowbyGabrielle Zevin,The WomenbyKristin Hannah, andThe TellbyAmy Griffin. The books have a few things in common: They’re all written by female authors, and feature main characters that could fall under the “strong female lead” umbrella. They are all distinguished members of theNew York Timesbestseller club. The two fictional entries,Tomorrow and Tomorrow and TomorrowandThe Women, both had their film rights snapped up in big-deal movie contracts before the books even hit shelves. Although none of the three authors have openly criticized Ivanka’s dear old dad,Donald Trump, they carry thematic messages that he might not love so much. And the books she read have been praised by other authors and public figures whohavespoken publicly against her father. Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow, which was published in 2022, follows two friends and eventual creative collaborators through decades, from childhood to middle age, co-creating a hit video game along the way and facing various slings and arrows, together and apart. A major theme of the novel is the push-pull between money and art, a salient topic in a time when artists face personal and financial peril under an unsmiling government. The book was a critical and commercial success, and made theNew York Times’ list of the 100 most notable books of the 21st century. Among its fans are authorJohn Green, who has been vocal about his take of Trump as a national disaster.Green called the novel“one of the best books I’ve ever read.”Bill Gates,whodonated some $50 millionto organizations supportingKamala Harrisbefore Election Day and has sincepublicly sounded the alarmon the current administration’s cuts to public health, loved it too. He said that the book “resonated with me for personal reasons,” but also that the story is “a terrific metaphor for human connection.” DNC speakerOprah Winfreyincluded the bookin her list of the best books of 2022. More recently, Zevin was at the center of a controversy when aChicago bookstore removed the novelfrom consideration for the store's book club, calling Zevin “a Zionist” in an email and explaining that they didn't want to give her “monetary support.” She has never publicly spoken about her views on Israel, and was also included on aseparate list of reportedly Zionist authorsfor readers to consider boycotting. Thebookstore publicly apologizedfor removing her book from the poll without discussion, and to their Jewish customers, but not to Zevin herself. Ivanka Trump is also Jewish, having converted before marrying Kushner. Hannah’sThe Women,a historical fiction account of a young woman working as a military nurse during the Vietnam War, was also an instant No. 1NYTbestseller. It explores themes of mental health and trauma—not things Trump is a huge believer in, beside his many gaffes around military veterans. (Remember when he said that recipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor arein “bad shape” or “dead”? Or his assertion that those who seek help for mental health or suffer from PTSDaren't “strong”? How about his former chief of staff sayingTrump referred to fallen vetsas “suckers” and “losers”? Hedisputedthat last one, but there are more where that came from.)Gates calledHannah’s book a “beautifully written tribute to a group of veterans who deserve more appreciation for the incredible sacrifices they made.”Nicholas Kristof, theadamantly anti-TrumpPulitzer Prize-winningNew York Timesjournalist, dubbed the book “historical fiction at its very best.” And then there’s recent releaseThe Tell, a memoir from Griffin. It’s also a bestseller and got the full Oprah’s Book Club treatment, sticker on the cover and all. In the book, Griffin details how she uncovered childhood and sexual trauma with the help of psychedelic drugs.Chanel Miller, author ofKnow My Name, her own account of the trauma of beingsexually assaulted byBrock Turner, praised the book as “transformative and illuminating.” Miller invoked Trump,accused several times over of sexual assault, which he denied, in her own memoir, writing, “We live in a time where it has become difficult to distinguish between the President's words and that of a 19-year-old assailant. Society gives women the near impossible task of separating harmlessness from danger, the foresight of knowing what some men are capable of.” So, Ivanka, tell us, your imaginary book club: What did you take from these books that your dad would almost certainly abhor?

    "title": "Karen Read’s Second Murder Trial: Let the Witness Questioning Begin",
    "article_text": "Karen Read’s second murder trialhas started off much differently fromher first. On Tuesday, the former equity analyst was back in the defendant’s seat in the same Dedham, Massachusetts, courtroom where she stood trial last year, once again facing charges of second-degree murder, manslaughter, and leaving the scene of an injury or accident. The allegations stem from the mysterious 2022 death of her Boston police officer boyfriend, John O’Keefe, who was found on the lawn of another Boston police officer,Brian Albert,in a blizzard. Because of the nontraditional defendant (a woman with advanced degrees), alleged manner of death (being killed by a car isless common than being poisoned), and claims (that Read is being framed in an elaborate law-enforcement cover-up), the trial snowballed into a global internet obsession by the time it ended in a hung jury last July. According to the defense, five jurors have since come forward to say that during the first trial jurors voted unanimously to acquit Read of second-degree murder and of leaving the scene, but they did not understand that they could come to a partial verdict. Read has appealed the decision up to the Supreme Court, which still has not decided whether it will take the case, and denied her emergency request to pause the Norfolk County case. Read’s legal team is larger this time around:Robert Alessiof New York sat alongside Read’s lawyers from the previous trial,Alan Jackson, David Yannetti,andElizabeth Little. Victoria George,an alternate juror from the first trial who, asVanity Fairreported,joinedRead’s team after growing frustrated with special prosecutorHank Brennan’s statements during pretrial hearings last month, sat in the gallery with a legal pad in hand. AndEvan Wolk—a third-year Boston College Law School student and one of nine law clerks working for Read—was perched behind two computer screens in place of the defense’s previous A/V specialist. All 11 of Read’s additions are working pro bono, after the defendant sunk seven figures of savings and donations into paying for her first defense. Readchangedher strategy too: The meticulous, LA-basedJacksondelivered the opening remarks, as opposed to the Massachusetts-based Yannetti, who delivered the defense’s opening statement in the first trial. Within the first 90 seconds, Jackson brought up the fact thatMichael Proctor,the lead investigator on Read’s case, had been fired by the Massachusetts State Police last month. (Proctor plans to appeal the decision, according to his lawyer.) “Massachusetts State Police found…Michael Proctor guilty of bringing dishonor to the department,” Jackson told the pool of 18 jurors from the podium. “Not in some other case…in this case.” Among the reasons for his dismissal, said Jackson, “bias in favor of his friends” and “bias against my client.” He looked up at the jurors: “Do you have any idea how hard it is for a state trooper to be fired?” After a beat, Jackson continued: “Well, the evidence is going to show that Michael Proctor earned it—every bit of it.” Jackson brought up the damning text message that Proctor sent hours into the investigation—determining thatBrian Albert,the Canton local on whose property O’Keefe was found, would not “catch any shit,” as Jackson put it, because “he’s a Boston cop too.” Said Jackson, “That quote defines the lack of integrity of the Commonwealth’s entire case, entire investigation, and this prosecution.” The entire investigation, he said, was “corrupted by bias, corrupted by incompetence, and corrupted by deceit.” Moments beforehand, Brennan had delivered his own opening salvo. Like Read, the Commonwealth has also changed its legal lineup and strategy.Adam Lally,the Norfolk assistant district attorney who acted as lead prosecutor the first time around, had delivered his opening remarks in monotone. But Brennan—the former Whitey Bulger defense lawyer slated to earn up to $225,000 on the case, according to CBS News outlet WBZ—was confident and dynamic. He left the podium, and walked back and forth before jurors like the lawyer in a TV drama might, outlining the prosecution’s case. “We are here today because John O’Keefe was killed by the actions and conduct of that defendant, Karen Read,” Brennan said, pointing to Read in her seat. There’s a degree of theater to trial lawyering, and Brennan brought a certain dramatic flare to the proceeding as he described the Commonwealth’s version of events: that after a night of heavy drinking and fighting, Read dropped O’Keefe off at 34 Fairview Road, and then reversed into him at a high speed. “She put the Lexus in reverse, put her foot on the gas pedal, and began to press. Not 25%, not 50%…up to 75%,” he said, motioning as if his hand were the foot on the pedal. “The Lexus tires spun backward, she went backwards at least 70 feet. She clipped John O’Keefe. He fell backwards, hit his head, broke his skull.” Jackson, meanwhile, told jurors that they would hear from a medical professional new to the case:Elizabeth Laposata,a forensic pathologist who teaches at Brown University, who will assert that the injury to the back of O’Keefe’s head was “immediately incapacitating” and “produced by an impact from a raised or ledged surface, a surface that does not exist on Brian Albert’s front lawn.” Laposata will also testify, he said, that none of O’Keefe’s injuries arose from a collision or hypothermia—the latter of which is significant because the Commonwealth alleges that O’Keefe was left to die in the front yard during a blizzard for over five hours. Jackson told the courtroom that Laposata determined that “John O’Keefe was injured someplace warmer and he was moved. That alone is reasonable doubt.” Absent from Brennan’s opening statement were several important details to the case. Though he repeatedly referenced 34 Fairview Road, the property where O’Keefe was found, he never mentioned that the owner was Albert, a Boston police officer. He never mentioned Proctor’s name, despite the fact that he had been the lead investigator on the case. And he never discussed the glaring holes in the investigation. Jackson planted seeds about the coincidences following O’Keefe’s death that involved Albert andBrian Higgins,an agent at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), both of whom Read claims were involved in O’Keefe’s death. (Albert and Higgins deny any involvement in O’Keefe’s death.) After Albert’s dog attacked a dog and bit a woman who tried to intervene about three months after O’Keefe’s death, Albert rehomed his dog of seven years and moved out of the house he and his family had owned for decades. (A lawyer for Albert previously toldVFthat the decision to sell the family house was not related to the case.) “You’ll also learn [that] after this incident, within days of one another, both Brian Higgins and Brian Albert—both police officers, both trained investigators—got rid of their phones,” Jackson said. Describing the morning of January 29, 2022, Jackson said, “Blood-curdling screams, ambulances, emergency lights on, fire engines, ladder trucks, paramedics, patrol vehicles, patrol cruisers, police officers, first responders, firefighters, all swarming over Brian Albert’s lawn, literally feet under his bedroom window. Yet Brian Albert, a sworn peace officer, a first responder himself, never came outside. Never went outside to see what the chaos was about…to assist a man in need.” (The Alberts have said they slept through the noise.) Read claims that she was framed in an elaborate cover-up involving four law-enforcement agencies. After a short break, the first witness Brennan called to the stand wasTimothy Nuttall,the firefighter and paramedic Brennan mentioned in his opening argument as having overheard Read say “I hit him” on the morning of January 29, 2022. Nuttall told Brennan about responding to the Albert home and testified that he heard Read say “I hit him” three times. At last year’s trial, Nuttall testified that he heard the statement from Read twice. According to Jackson, Proctor’s report, written within two weeks of O’Keefe’s death, mentioned Nuttall overhearing “I hit him” once. Making the second trial more treacherous for certain witnesses is the fact that they’ve been interviewed so many times—before grand juries, a prior jury, and by investigators—that they risk impeaching themselves should their memory of events be different on the stand this time around. Under cross-examination by Jackson, Nuttall revealed that he met with the prosecution three times in the last three weeks to discuss prior testimony—specifically the number of times Nuttall says he heard Read say, “I hit him.” Nuttall told Jackson that he spoke to Brennan as recently as Monday night, the night before he testified as a prosecution witness. “What did you talk about last night?” asked Jackson. “Mostly just…” he said, before a pause, “making sure that everything was as it had been. And by that I mean it was three times, and that we were continuously making sure that everything was the way that it had happened that morning.” On Wednesday, the prosecution calledKerry Robertsto the witness stand. She was with Read when the defendant discovered O’Keefe’s body on the lawn. Though she has since testified about noticing Read’s taillight was broken on the morning of January 29, 2022—a crucial detail of the case—she did not mention it in her initial interview with law enforcement. “I didn’t want to accuse anyone of anything,” Roberts told Jackson under cross-examination. Another important detail of the case has been a Google search made onJennifer McCabe’s phone—“hos [sic] long to die in cold”—the morning O’Keefe’s body was found. McCabe has maintained that she only made the search at Read’s request after O’Keefe was found in the snow. Roberts previously testified before a grand jury, under the penalty of perjury, that she heard Read ask McCabe that question. But on the stand Wednesday, she admitted she did not in fact hear the question asked. “That was a false statement, wasn’t it?” Jackson asked Roberts, as she grew agitated under his needling. “Yes, technically,” said Roberts. After a heated back-and-forth, she said, “I misunderstood the question.” On Wednesday, O’Keefe’s mother,Margaret,also testified. She was asked by Brennan to describe her immediate family. She recalled her daughter, Kristen, dying from cancer in 2013 and pointed out her son Paul. Speaking about her deceased son, she addressed the courtroom: “Then you all know about John.” She tearfully reminisced about her late son and the morning she learned he was dead. The call came to her from Roberts: “She said John was found in a snowbank…they don’t know what happened.” Margaret testified that when she spoke to Read, she learned that the defendant had dropped O’Keefe off at Albert’s home the night before. “I said, ‘You just left him there?’” recalled Margaret. “She said, ‘Yes, I just left him there.’” HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter Inside Elon Musk’s Grievance-FueledMAGA-morphosis Sinners’ End CreditsExplained The OriginalGirl of the Year Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought Who Is Pete Hegseth’s Wife,Jennifer Rauchet?

    "title": "Beat the Press: How Team Trump Is Trying to Keep the Media in Check",
    "article_text": "It may seem like an odd time to party in Washington. But this weekend, political journalists and politicos will gather for the annual White House Correspondents’ Association dinner (and a slew of late-night soirees and boozy brunches). The media ritual can “serve as a barometer for the press and White House relations,” says Hive editorMichael Calderoneon this week’s episode ofInside the Hive,appearing alongside host andVanity Faireditor in chiefRadhika Jonesand executive editorClaire Howorth.Over the years, the weekend has also had a significant cultural impact, the most consequential dinner likely being in 2011 whenBarack Obamaaddressed birtherism rumors and took shots atDonald Trump.Whether or not that speech is why Trump is now president, it directly “contributes to the origin story of Donald Trump as president. Somebody who had consistently felt like the establishment in Washington mocked him, was against him,” says Calderone. Trump, of course, has no plans to attend the event this year. The dinner also comes at a time when the traditional roles of the White House Correspondents’ Association are being threatened and even taken away by the White House, and as the president continues to berate and attack the press and the First Amendment more broadly. Before he even began his second term, Trump secured a $15 million payment from ABC News as part of a defamation lawsuit. He also still has lawsuits pending against CBS,The Des Moines Register,the journalistBob Woodward,and the Pulitzer Prize Board. The effects will likely result in a lot of press scaling back their coverage, says Howorth. “Because a lot of outlets can’t afford to engage in these battles.” It’s also a matter of bandwidth as the media landscape today is much more fractured than it used to be, says Jones. “The lawsuits themselves are costly and expensive, but so is the labor that goes into simply conducting a legal review of your journalism and making sure that everything is up to snuff.” HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter Inside Elon Musk’s Grievance-FueledMAGA-morphosis Sinners’ End CreditsExplained The OriginalGirl of the Year Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought Who Is Pete Hegseth’s Wife,Jennifer Rauchet?

    "title": "Rashid Johnson on Middle Age, Being Inspired by Amiri Baraka, and What’s at the Heart of His Guggenheim Retrospective",
    "article_text": "ArtistRashid Johnsonhas recently let the light in,renovating the ceilingsof his Brooklyn studio to flood the space via skylight. “A Poem for Deep Thinkers,” the first major solo exhibition of Johnson’s work that opened April 18, does something similar, as theGuggenheim spotlights his multidisciplinary practiceover the course of his three-decade career. The exhibition, which features more than 90 works spanningblack soap paintings, large-scale indoor and outdoor sculpture, film, and video, is a confrontation of time and remembering. In response, Johnson is trying to remain honest. “At the heart of my project is a real attempt when I’m asked something to try to frame it in the most honest way. To say what I was thinking.” In many ways, the survey has been a long time coming. The museum has collected Johnson’s work, he is old friends with chiefcuratorNaomi Beckwith,and prior to his time on themuseum’s board of trusteesfrom 2016 to 2023,formerdirectorRichard Armstronghad envisioned Johnson’s work filling the museum’sFrank Lloyd Wright–designedrotunda. “I saw, in Rashid’s work, an early sculptor and video artist; I saw a maturing artist who could make unassuming materials sing; I saw a lifelong student of Black history and culture; I saw a poet and seeking philosopher,” Beckwith detailed in an email toVF. “These minor narratives were the bookmarks we used to get people reacquainted with this brilliant and sensitive artist.” Throughout Johnson’s evolution, his practice has remained highly referential.Black historic figures are recurrent, like Frederick Douglass and W.E.B Du Bois; Johnson’s origin as a photographer is cornerstone, as this established him as an artist of note with the inclusion of his portraits in“Freestyle,” the Studio Museum in Harlem’s 2001 exhibitwhereinchief curatorThelma Goldendeemed theincluded artists “post-Black.”He has since made his feature-lengthdirectorial debut withNative Son(2019) tomixed critical reception, and his latest film,Sanguine,is a 35-mm short, probing generational relationships as he, his father,Jimmy,and his son,Julius,all feature. His sociopolitical criticality has adapted into his present investment in more “soulful” investigations. “Previously I would’ve been intimidated to use ’the soul’ or ’God’ or ’beauty’ and simple form and tone, and to have the confidence, the wherewithal, the recognition that it didn’t come at the expense of my critical voice and my challenge to the rigors of how one goes about making.” Which has now made self-reference more approachable. “There’s a different confidence that comes from allowing your own experience in a different way, soulfully, to impact what it is you’re making.” As the son ofpoet and professor of African historyCheryl Johnson-Odimand brother of poetMaya Odim,one wonders, does he write poetry of his own? “I did for many years but not so much anymore,” Johnson recalls, sat back on a sectional under the skylight. “I consider now the artworks that I make, the visual artworks, as poems.” The studio space mirrors the sprawl in Johnson’s project: Towering ceilings give the large work from hisSoul Paintingseries on one of the walls immense breathing room. Many surfaces are spotted through with ceramic pots and stacks of poetry books, calling to mind the artist’s ongoing series of steel-grid sculptures, started in 2004,a recent iteration of which is a site-specific installation scaffolding the Whitney museum’s plaza. There an illuminated steel-bar grid of shelves straddles the museum’s indoor and outdoor spaces.Its title,New Poetry,like the title of the spring Guggenheim survey, “A Poem for Deep Thinkers,” is lifted from therepertoireof poet,activist, and teacher Amiri Baraka. Baraka, whose presence looms large in Johnson’s oeuvre,performed the work at the New College of California in 1977, the year Johnson was born. (“In the way he reads it there’s definitely a sense of humor, but like all of Baraka’s stuff, there’s this sense of indictment as well.”) “Artists working in the cultural space today and critical thinkers working in the space today, whether it be around academic space or aesthetic critical spaces: We’re all in the soup and finding ways,” Johnson says, only to be interrupted by a phone call. “This is mybuddyHank Willis Thomas.We talked about this actually.” Such is keeping company with deep thinkers. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Vanity Fair: As a culture, we often conjure the “greats,” their legacy, and that’s the end of the conversation. In some ways you do it too, by bringing in these thinkers and poets. To what extent are you trying to be part of that legacy? Rashid Johnson: I’m almost always conjuring these spaces with the idea that they are alive. I’m always really interested in the transgressive position of challenging and interrupting and employing. But employing within the framework of contemporary discourse and a present discourse. How do things become prescient and how do they become employable in thenowspace. I don’t think of Du Bois or Frederick Douglass or Harold Cruse or Amiri Baraka orAngela Davisor Octavia Butler or Toni Morrison as dead voices. I feel like it’s pyramidal, in the respect that it’s bottom up: that I’m climbing onto this lattice that was built by the antecedent contributors, and then I’m carrying up more material. We’re all finding ways to continue the tradition of learning from the folks who predated you and then amplifying their ideas while contributing your own. I don’t know what James Weldon Johnson thought about: I can’t speak to that. And I do see the value in taking time to recognize the contributions of others just as contributions, but I’m also deeply invested in the critical unpacking and the malleability and the evolution and the fact that these ideas are alive and that all ideas are alive. This point in your life is being defined as your midcareer, but maybe to you it’s “I just got started” or “I’m at the end, actually.” Where are you? I am always in the middle: liminal space, transition, thresholded space. I feel like I am constantly in the middle of something, whether it’s quite literally in the middle of finishing a painting or in the middle of finishing a script and a film. And the post-mediumness of my project has always kept me feeling like I’m a moving target to some degree. I’m in the middle chronologically, and I think the fact that this—you would imagine it likely would—falls in that space we call middle age is really appropriate. Middle-aged space is inherently a crisis space. It’s a compounding set of crises. Thematically and critically, it all builds up to making you feel very challenged and forced to account for your actions. And that sense of accountability is actually rewarding. Being forced to look at actions I took in my early 20s and how those actions output as artworks, and then being challenged to not only see them, recognize them as part of my narrative, but to explain them to some degree or to have them explained to me is a really interesting thing. Because I don’t exactly remember all of the specifics of what motivated everything that I’ve ever done. I think if you were to ask anyone, they would have a similarly challenging experience. They said, “Okay, you were 20 and you did this, and you did that, and you did the other thing. Why did you do that?” And you’re like, “Well…” Amiri Baraka’s words loom large in your work and especially in this exhibition. Thinking about a crisis state or the idea that in your critical being, there’s a chance for transition, or evolution, or growth: that all leads me to Baraka. In particular, the title for this exhibition, “A Poem for Deep Thinkers,” was born of me employing that particular poem by Baraka in a film that’s included in the exhibition. The film is titledSanguine,which is also part of a large installation that happens at the top of the rotunda. I borrow and actually use Baraka’s words and him reading from that particular poem in the film. That poem is an interesting challenge. It’s a challenge to our times, and it feels prescient. He is really trying to hold accountable an educated class of folks and calling into question where their loyalties lie and where their ambitions lie, and questioning their sense of action and their sense of responsibility. Then for your use, who’s on the other end of that indictment? It starts with me, to be honest. There are aspects in that poem that I had to ask myself, and consistently I’m asking myself: What are the intentions of these objects? What are the goals of this project? And do my actions live up to my ambitions? The calls coming from within the building. I think one of the really significant transgressions in an artist project is the willingness to self-challenge and the willingness to recognize your limitations, but at the same time, question what is at the center of your project? I don’t have, and I wish I did, but I don’t have solutions in my project. When people ask me more flat questions, like, what is the intention of this? I’m challenged by it. Sometimes I can kind of conjure an answer. I’ve become less interested in conjuring that answer because it just doesn’t have a solution. There just isn’t a solution. And it’s okay for something to be flimsy in a way and malleable, it’s okay to be in a liminal space. It’s okay to be in transition. It’s okay to be in crisis. And so that brings back Baraka in that idea of transition. I’ve always felt—it’s a strange point of reference—but that I am somehow consistently in a space of crisis and transition, maybe the one Baraka experienced, but that I stay present in that space, that atomic condition of ignition. So, how isthe anxietythese days? It’s not so much in front of me in the same way that it had been previously, but it’s like a scar where I could see it, and I know it’s there, and sometimes it comes back and it comes back in a way that is scary and frustrating. To your point, at an earlier stage, I think that there was a more significant recognition of it because it was really, really actively, consistently producing obstacles. But you get a little bit older, you learn how to treat and affect these things, and then you sometimes move these things into other spaces. I no longer have the same existential crisis that I had as a younger man because I have a child and I’ve moved my concern from my own crisis to his development. And you think about and see the cycles of politics and the changing of the guard, and you recognize what and how younger voices are contributing to discourse in a different way. And maybe I don’t feel as responsible to be leading the charge vocally like I may have thought at a different stage. So, I just feel like I could be a witness and a present participant. A step back? Not so much a step back, but having a different sense of patience and a different willingness to hear and listen. That and just maybe I’m not as smart as I thought I was. That is one of the most rewarding things to come to recognize, is that I have a lot to learn, and I’m here for the contradictions. It’s those spaces in between, again, those liminal spaces that are really fantastic because when you learn to be comfortable being uncomfortable, then you are in the cut. And that’s what I’m trying to learn to do.

    "title": "How Walter Cronkite Unwittingly Coached David Frost to Extract Richard Nixon’s Confession",
    "article_text": "Believe it or not, there was a time, in another America, where, with a few words, a network TV anchor could trigger a seismic shift in public opinion. On February 27, 1968, Walter Cronkite, anchoring theCBS Evening News,turned straight to camera and, for the final three minutes of the broadcast, broke from a career of neutrality as a reporter and delivered a deeply felt editorial on the state of the Vietnam War. It had, he said, reached a point of deadly stalemate and the only way out was not a military victory but an honorably negotiated peace. One month later President Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he would not be seeking a second term. Cronkite had spoken truth to power, and Johnson, knowing and feeling as deeply about the falsehoods told about the war as Cronkite was exhausted by the burden of presiding over it, knew the truth was far worse than had so far been revealed. In September 1969, Cronkite was interviewed on television by David Frost, a newcomer to American broadcasting who had been brought from London by Westinghouse to host a daily talk show taped in New York. Frost had made a reputation in London for a new style of rigorously researched, often news-making interviews. But by some in the hallowed halls of American television journalism, he was regarded as an upstart outsider, while Cronkite comfortably wore the mantle of “the most trusted man in America.” Cronkite did not patronize Frost, and Frost was clearly in awe of him. Talking of how journalism had finally exposed the falsehoods of the war, Frost asked Cronkite, “Is it possible for huge things to be concealed?” “Yes, I think it is,” said Cronkite. “But this is the job of the press—I mean that generically: television, radio, the newspapers—to uncover as much of it as we possibly can, to be sure that those things are not concealed. I don’t think they can be concealed forever. I think they will come out. The truth will come out.” That encounter was the beginning of Frost’s personal passage covering some of America’s most contentious political events that would eventually lead to his historic “confessional” interview with Richard Nixon in 1977, a key moment in a new documentary series airing on MSNBC,David Frost Vs,created by his sonWilfred Frost.I asked Wilfred, who is an anchor on Sky News in London, about that moment when Cronkite seemed, in a sense, to be steering his father toward a clear sense of where he should be headed. “That interview,” he said, “is like a 101 for a broadcast journalist. It’s so rare for me to see dad playing the role of the apprentice.” Cronkite was a seasoned war reporter. His impassioned editorial followed a trip to the battlefields of Vietnam that had, he told Frost in a masterpiece of understatement, left him “quite upset.” But it was not until 1971 that it was revealed that a succession of presidents had concealed from the public (and Congress) how badly the war had been directed, with the publication of a portion of the Pentagon Papers, a vast and damning archive of documents disclosed by the anti-war activist Daniel Ellsberg. In June 1972, Frost interviewed Ellsberg, who said that underlying the whole scandal was an attitude, embedded in both the Pentagon and the White House, to think of “the American public…as an adversary to be tricked, to be manipulated, to be lied to.” This remained true, he said, of the current president, Richard Nixon: “We have an unelected monarch at this point.” At the time, Frost did not know that his show was being monitored by the FBI, which had on at least one occasion planted an agent in the studio audience, according to theNew York Post. In the White House, Nixon taped many of the shows as part of his habit of tracking any of his many perceived enemies who appeared as guests. (That was also true of J. Edgar Hoover at the FBI.) This turned out to be lucky for Wilfred Frost. A cache of episodes that were otherwise missing from the Frost archives were found in the Nixon library in California, including a key segment in the documentaries featuringJane Fondaand the activist Huey Newton. By 1970, Nixon recognized Frost as a rising force in television journalism and invited him to host the White House Christmas party. Watching that event in the documentary, now knowing that Frost would eventually extract from Nixon a tortured apology to the American people, it’s hard to tell who is actually manipulating whom. But I knew just how keenly Frost was studying the complex psychodrama that was the life of Richard Nixon. We had worked closely together for some time. Frost achieved almost overnight fame in the UK as the anchor ofThat Was the Week That Was,a now legendary Saturday night satirical gig on the BBC (and spiritual precursor toSaturday Night Live). When I first met him he was restless, looking for a more serious role. He had followed my work as an investigative journalist, and thought it had lessons for television journalism. Others were discouraging him from dropping the work that had made him a star. How could a satirist suddenly become a serious journalist? I thought otherwise. In 1966, Frost moved from the BBC to commercial television to anchor a new hour-long live prime-time show five nights a week,The Frost Programme,with a risky new format: interviewing news-making figures in front of a studio audience who were invited to join in. Frost’s acuity made him a challenging interviewer. Backed by a team of skilled researchers, his forensic method broke new ground when one of his guests, an insurance swindler, faced an audience that included some of his victims, and he was later jailed for fraud. Some newspaper critics disparaged the program as “trial by television.” In fact, we had drawn on dossiers from investigative reporters whose published stories had had no result, whereas one interrogation on TV by Frost saw justice finally move. The culmination of that technique came a decade later in 1977 with the historic Nixon confrontation. Frost recorded their interview near Nixon’s California home and swung between softball conversation and the pursuit of a carefully calibrated evidential trail of Nixon’s culpability in the cover-up of Watergate. For all his trappings of power, Nixon was strangely susceptible to Frost’s jet-set glamour. He was, however, maladroit in his small talk: After a weekend break in the filming he asked Frost, “Did you do any fornicating?” That mood soon changed. Nixon was warned by his advisers where Frost was headed: “Don’t give him an inch because a mile will be taken.” With a deliberately theatrical gesture, Frost threw aside the clipboard containing his notes that he always had. Leaning forward and looking grave he asked if Nixon was now ready to apologize for his actions, leading to the cathartic moment when Nixon agreed. “I let down the American people,” he said. “I have to carry that burden with me for the rest of my life. My political life is over.” For me, that clipboard had long been at the heart of Frost’s method. In London I was usually the last person to brief him before he went out to the cameras. By then the clipboard had several pages of notes, but in a format legible only to him, with some individual words circled, others underlined, others starred. There was no visible chronology. Frost had the capacity, like someone prepping for a crucial examination, for absorbing detailed packets of information (and, after a program, for wiping it all like a disposable tape). He was instinctively tactical in the clipboard’s use, depending on the way an interview developed. His greatest asset, something few of his rivals managed, was the ability to listen carefully to answers and, suddenly and comfortably, drop everything on the clipboard and pursue an unexpected opening presented by his subject. With this came a similarly improvised skill in engaging an audience. The documentaries convey a sense of watching epic historical moments as people experienced them, unfiltered by historians. It was something new to American television. On a set where the furnishings looked like cast-offs from a Reno bordello, in a converted theater on West 44th Street, Frost wrangled a cockpit of debate and conflict with consummate balance.The David Frost Showwas canceled in 1972, after some 750 performances involving around 5,000 guests.

    "article_text": "On Wednesday,Meghan Markletook to the stage at the annual Time100 Summit, where she spoke with Time CEOJessica Sibleyabout her busy year so far, which has included the initial release ofher Netflix showWith Love, Meghan,thelaunch of her lifestyle business As Ever, and the premiere ofher podcast,Confessions of a Female Founder.While discussingWith Love, Meghan’supcoming second season, already filmed, the duchess revealed thatchef and humanitarianJosé Andréswill make an appearance on one of the episodes. Meghan jokingly apologized to Netflix CEOTed Sarandos,another guest at the annual event, for sharing the secret. “We haven’t revealed [much] about season two,” she said. “Ted will come here later, so I can apologize in advance for saying José Andrés is going to be on the season.” Meghan and her husbandPrince Harryhave developed a close friendship with Andrés over the years, and the couple’s Archewell Foundation has donated to his World Central Kitchen organization to support projects includingCOVID-19 relief effortsandLos Angeles fire recovery. (L-R) Jessica Sibley and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex onstage during the 2025 TIME100 Summit. Meghan and Harry were both honored inTime’s 2021 list of 100 influential people, but Meghan spoke solo during this year’s event. In her conversation with Sibley, Meghan discussed the process that went intolaunching As Ever, and her excitement when its initial eight products sold out after only 45 minutes. She also mentioned she was happythe brand’s flower petal “sprinkles,”which were featured on multiple episodes ofWith Love, Meghan,had become such a phenomenon, adding that she actually used them at home on parfaits, salads, and even scrambled eggs. “I would be just like a little fairy, tossing them around all of the time,” Meghan said. “I think it speaks to the tiny moments of joy that are so effortless and just create a little bit of magic.” She likes the “level of charm” they bring, but said they are just one part of her larger philosophy. “Take flower sprinkles as an analogy and just think about all the small moments in your life that could just have a little splash of magic.” Riffing on the title ofher podcast,Confessions of a Female Founder,Sibley asked the duchess if she had anything she wanted to confess during their conversation. Meghan answered the question with a look into how she is processing her recent busy months. “I think a confession for you, today, that I can very comfortably say is I’m the happiest I've ever been,” the duchess said. “To have a partner and husband who's just so supportive and to have healthy kids that are so joyful. And the freeness of their life and the safety of their life that we create for them. For all the things that have happened in my life, I never would’ve imagined getting here at this point. I feel just so happy and grateful.” HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter Inside Elon Musk’s Grievance-FueledMAGA-morphosis Sinners’ End CreditsExplained The OriginalGirl of the Year Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought Who Is Pete Hegseth’s Wife,Jennifer Rauchet?

    "title": "Sarah Ferguson Says Her Cancer Diagnoses Felt “Like a Death Sentence”",
    "article_text": "Sarah Ferguson,the Duchess of York and ex-wife ofPrince Andrew,announced that she’d been diagnosed withbreast cancerfollowing a routine mammogram in June 2023, less than a year before revealingher diagnosis of skin cancerin January 2024. As part of a new campaign raising awareness for teens with cancer, Ferguson toldThe Timesthat the diagnoses felt “like a death sentence.” Nearly two years after Ferguson’s first diagnosis, her tests have shown no sign of her cancer recurring, and now the duchess is joining with her daughters,Princess BeatriceandPrincess Eugenie,to help raise awareness about the experiences of UK teens who have also been afflicted by the disease. On Wednesday, the three are making a visit to a cancer unit supported by the Teenage Cancer Trust, where they’ll speak to teens who are currently undergoing treatment. Ferguson has also signed an open letter to the UK’s secretary of state for health and social care,Wes Streeting,urging for more resources to be put toward diagnoses and mental health support in young people. Inan essay forThe Times,Ferguson discussed the more than three decades she has spent as a patron of the trust. “My father and stepfather both died of it and I have gone through two diagnoses,” she wrote. “It’s incredibly important to me to seek to amplify the voices and experiences of people with cancer who receive less attention, whose voices are not listened to and who can be overlooked. One group consistently neglected by those developing health plans and policies is teenagers and young adults with cancer. The impact can be devastating.” Ferguson’s diagnoses came ahead of two other members of the royal family,King Charles IIIandKate Middleton,revealing that they were undergoing treatment for unspecified forms of cancer. The Princess of Wales, who became a patron of the Royal Marsden hospital after she was treated there, announced thatshe was in remissionin January. The king, however, is still undergoing treatment for his cancer, and a Buckingham Palace sourcesaid last yearthat it was “a managed condition.” Though his health has been stable enough to allow for international travel and participation in public events, Charles was admitted to the hospitalon March 27after experiencing treatment side effects during an outpatient visit.

    "title": "The Hosts of MSNBC’s ‘The Weeknight’ Say They’ll Cover Trump 2.0 “Without Fear, Without Favor”",
    "article_text": "“The mission of MSNBC remains the same, regardless of who’s in office—lead with the facts, share context,”Alicia MenendeztellsVanity Fairof covering a second Trump term in a new role for the network. “We are covering this administration without fear, without favor, and with a lot of coffee.” Menendez,Symone Sanders Townsend,andMichael Steeleare all making the big move to MSNBC prime time from their weekend panel program, cohosting a new 7 p.m. show titledThe Weeknight.It launches on May 5, taking the slot previously held byJoy Reid,who has since departed the network andset up a Substack. The show will air for two hours on Monday and one hour from Tuesday through Friday. The expansion of theWeekendfranchise, which was launched with the trio in January 2024, comes as newly appointed MSNBC presidentRebecca Kutlerbegins to put her mark on the network’s programming lineup. And the three are ready to take on the challenge of anchoring a show on weeknights, which will see them react to the flood of news that’s come out of the White House, and elsewhere, throughout the day. Sanders Townsend points out that they all have gotten some experience in the 7 p.m. slotsince Reid’s exit. “We’ve all been hosting it and have gotten in kind of that muscle memory.” “We’re 16 months in, and Michael still likes to be like, ‘Well, I’m new here,’” quips Menendez when asked about their dynamic as a trio. “Look, I’m just a brother trying to figure it all out. I don’t want to step on anybody’s toes,” Steele, who has been a regular contributor to the network for more than a decade, says. Sanders Townsend, who previously served as the chief spokesperson for Vice PresidentKamala Harris,adds, “It’s like we’re inviting you into our cool-kids table to talk about it all.” All three of the hosts have been either directly involved in politics at a granular level or around it to some degree. Steele previously served as the lieutenant governor of Maryland and the chairman of the Republican National Committee; Sanders Townsend was a Democratic operative and adviser; and Menendez, who has been covering politics for years, is also the daughter of disgraced former senatorBob Menendez.When asked how they respond to complaints about a government-to-media pipeline, Sanders Townsend says, “We aren’t the first, to be very clear, and we won’t be the last.” “And now apparently there’s a journalist-to-government pipeline. Hello, SecretaryPete Hegseth,” Sanders Townsend also points out, referencing the Fox News weekend anchor turned top Pentagon official. She adds that the hosts’ experience being “literally in the room” and around politics “helps us, frankly, connect with not just the viewers better, but our guests.” “If you’ve written talking points, if you’ve been on the talking points, then you know how to knock people off the talking points,” Menendez says. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Vanity Fair:The launch of the new show is coming at a particularly volatile political moment, a second Trump term with ongoing legal drama and consistent institutional battles. How are you looking at approaching this news cycle? Michael Steele:Volatile? Alicia, you think it’s volatile right now? It’s crazy. From my perspective, that’s what makes the conversation more exciting, to be able to find fresh angles about it. As a former elected official who ran a political party and really has an appreciation of how these dynamics are playing out negatively for the country, and how do we talk about that, what I love about what the three of us do is that we actually want to talk about it. We don’t want to get into the sort of performative kind of conversation where you’re not really pulling back layers of it like an onion. Each layer you pull back, you still cry. That’s what we try to do. We try to help people understand what’s happening right now and give it context historically, politically, socially, culturally, and with some humor and seriousness and all that’s required to have a good conversation. Alicia Menendez:The mission of MSNBC remains the same, regardless of who’s in office​​—lead with the facts, share context. So we are covering this administration without fear, without favor, and with a lot of coffee. Symone Sanders Townsend:We really think about adding context to what is happening. When you do a show on the weekend and you’re watching everything that’s happening all week, you have to pick and choose. You get time to say, Okay, we’ve seen it all. We’ve digested it all. This is what we think, and this is maybe a thread that nobody else pulled on. The difference between the weeknight is we are now going to be reacting in real time. We’ve had, obviously, lots of practice doing that over the years, but over the last couple of months, specifically, every single week, each one of us has been hosting the 7 p.m. hour. We’ve all been hosting it and have gotten in kind of that muscle memory, also bringing that same energy that we have on the weekend to our show because we are a conversation. It’s like we’re inviting you into our cool-kids table to talk about it all. You have all worked together now for over a year. Are there any specific roles that you have fallen into naturally? Menendez:We’re 16 months in, and Michael still likes to be like, “Well, I’m new here.” Sanders Townsend:Michael’s still like, “Oh, you ladies know it. I’m just here.” Steele:Look, I’m just a brother trying to figure it all out. I don’t want to step on anybody’s toes. I don’t want to make anybody mad. Menendez:You’ve learned which camera is your camera, Michael. Sanders Townsend:Any given day, we each play a different role, I would argue. We did a panel discussion with Reverend[Al] Sharptonthe other day, and we were toward the end, and Alicia was so funny. She said, “Since I’m the one whose job it is to usually get us to commercial break…” And we all cracked up because it’s true. Sometimes I done wrapped Michael up and he’s said what he’s said. Maybe I’m turnt up and I said what I said, and Alicia is like, “Thank you, and we will be right back.” And then we go on the other side and sometimes Alicia is very fired up about something, and it’s like, Clock it, Alicia, clock it. Let them know. I love the three-person dynamic. For Alicia and I, we used to host our own shows. It’s different when you have your own show. It’s about you, what you think, the stories that you like, your context. When you have a show with one or two other people, it is a group conversation. I didn’t think I would love it. The PR people were like, Should we say this? But I really feel this way. I didn’t know if I would love a group situation. I literally love the group situation. On the days that Michael or Alicia aren’t there, I’m like, Where are my people? I wonder what Alicia would say about this. Or, I think if Mr. Chairman was here, he would say X, Y, and Z. That rapport is real. Steele:For me, this is all new, you know. [Eye rolls from Menendez and Sanders Townsend] Menendez:He’s going to be at his retirement party— Sanders Townsend: He’s going to be like, “I’m still new here.” Steele:I’m not a journalist. Symone is a comms person extraordinaire, and I have mad respect for Alicia’s skills at journalism. I can be a silly billy. And these two are like, Let’s reframe and reset and focus. That, for me, is a little bit of a learning curve, because, remember, I’m the guy who was always being asked the questions for the last 13 years of my time at MSNBC. In my 14th year, I’m the one asking those questions of others, and so that transition has been fun. To Alicia’s point about the extemporaneous nature of it, that side of it is very fluid. It’s very real. But we’re mindful that we also need to get the important stuff in front of the audience​​—the background, the history, the storyline that they shouldn’t miss because of the politics or because of the craziness that’s coming out of the administration today, which can be the drama that’s distracting, as opposed to the underlying core thread that they’re stripping away your fundamental rights. Sanders Townsend:I do think that the people are the best barometer on this. We’re going to ask the questions to the news makers and the people that are at our table to see what they think and try to tease this conversation out, but also, like, let’s take it a step further. People understand that—they appreciate that clarity and they appreciate the directness. They appreciate that Michael isn’t trying to contort himself into a box of what someone who hosts the show should be like. They want Michael Steele. People want Alicia Menendez. They want Symone Sanders Townsend, and that is what we are going to bring to 7 p.m. And frankly, that’s what Rebecca [Kutler] and [Senior Vice PresidentGreg Kordick]want us to do. That’s why we have this opportunity. Michael and Symone, you worked in politics pretty extensively. I’m curious what your response would be to people who might be wary of the politics-to-media pipeline. How do you maintain journalistic integrity given your experiences? Sanders Townsend:We aren’t the first, to be very clear and we won’t be the last. And now apparently there’s a journalist-to-government pipeline. Hello, Secretary Pete Hegseth. Our experience gives us insight. I’ve worked with reporters from every angle, [with] my colleagues now at MSNBC, previously when I was a commentator at CNN, but also throughout my life as a political operative. Sometimes when you haven’t done it, when you haven’t been in the room, when it’s not something that you’ve lived, there’s things that you don’t think to ask. And it’s not something anyone can tell you; it’s just that you’ve lived it. And the thing that Michael and I bring is that we have lived this. I think that experience that we bring, having been literally in the room, helps us, frankly, connect with not just the viewers better, but our guests. We had the president of the Heritage Foundation on our show. We were the only show that got him on cable,Kevin Roberts,and that interview, I think, was a very important and illuminating interview that the three of us brought our various backgrounds to…to tease out the information that the viewers wanted to know. To get Kevin Roberts on the record of a number of things that the Heritage Foundation had said in prep, but no one had gotten them to stay on camera—those are the kind of interviews we want to do. We want to talk to the news makers. We want to talk to Republicans, because we want to understand what the hell is going on. Menendez:If you’ve written talking points, if you’ve been on the talking points, then you know how to knock people off the talking points. I’m wondering if any of you would be willing to speak to how and when discussions started about the move to weekdays. What kind of support has the network provided under the leadership of Rebecca Kutler during this transition? Sanders Townsend:Look, we found out when everybody else found out. So just go ahead and clear that up right there. No secret pipelines around here. That being said, I think it’s safe to say the network leadership has been extremely supportive of us. To be very clear, Rebecca made the decision to bring in all these different voices. We are expanding the weekend franchise.Jen [Psaki]is going to 9 p.m. The expansion of all these voices is wonderful, and it is responsive—not just to where, in my opinion, the moment is now, but where it is going. People want politics, but they want pop culture. They want to hear the news, but they also want someone to help them take it further, especially the MSNBC audience. They are a very engaged audience. The opportunity to move to prime, I mean, I was shocked and excited, but mostly shocked. Do you all have a group chat with each other? Menendez:Yes, several different group chats, and we’ve got side chats where Symone and I talk about outfits. Michael acts like he’s upset that he’s not in the conversation about the outfits. Sanders Townsend:It’s like, you’re gonna have on a suit. Like, you’re gonna wear blue. Menendez:Let me guess it’s blue. Sanders Townsend:Blue, or maybe purple. It’s the purple tie. We have multiple group chats. I will just note the group chat that has the three of us and our EP, Michael Steele is the lead photo, and we did, like, AI face-app enhancement on him. So it’s like a very young,Montel Williams–looking version of Michael Steele as our group photo. Very strong eyebrows.

    "title": "Instagram’s Adam Mosseri on the App’s Future, His Biggest Regrets, and Teenage Social Media Use",
    "article_text": "Adam Mosseri, head ofInstagram, recently stopped in Milan as part of the worldwide rollout of a new feature, the Teen Account, a suite of safety measures meant to automatically apply to the app’s youngest users. The initiative comes just as theNetflix hitAdolescencehas renewed the global debate around teenagers and social media. In a wide-ranging interview, Mosseri discussed the development of the teen initiative, his 17-year tenure at the company, fake news, artificial intelligence, and the future of social media. This interview originally appeared inVanity Fair Italia.It has been edited and condensed for clarity. Vanity Fair:What are you most proud of during your tenure at Instagram? The thing I am most proud of about Instagram is that I have managed to evolve the platform with the changing world. The hardest thing, in fact, has always been the same: to evolve the platforms. You have to move them forward, otherwise they die. This has a downside. When you change something, people get frustrated. When people thought of Instagram five or 10 years ago, they thought of a square photo feed. Today you mainly view videos. I got a lot of negative feedback at first when we initiated the changes. But, as I said, I preferred to move fast and then maybe slow down, instead of going too slow and becoming irrelevant. Was there a mistake you regret? Many. I will give you one example. In 2018 the first short video appeared. We called it Reels and decided to integrate it into Stories. It was a complete failure. We spent nine months, maybe a year, trying to make it work. Then we switched to today's version, in the feed, and it worked; the pandemic and the arrival of TikTok were also factors. The lesson I learned from that mistake is not only how important it is to move quickly, but also to be ready for anything. Because the world surprises you and you have to adapt. And if you can adapt faster than your competition, then you make a difference. I wish I hadn't made that mistake, but that mistake probably shaped more of the way I run Instagram today than anything else. You have launched the Teen Account just as much of the world has been captivated by the TV seriesAdolescence. You are a father. How can teenagers be educated about social media? And when is it right to give a kid their first smartphone? I think it depends on the kids. And I think everyone has their own role to play. Platforms need to do what they can to ensure children’s safety, phone manufacturers and operating systems [need] to increase it, and the government and schools need to do their part. But I think one of the most important tasks falls to parents, because no one knows a child’s needs better than they do. I have three sons. SeeingAdolescencewas really hard. How then do you teach a child or teenager to use social media responsibly and cope with bullies and harassment? The answer changes a lot if we are talking about a platform, like Instagram, or a parent. From the platform’s point of view, we have to do two things. The first is to try to prevent incidents of bullying or harassment. We have very specific rules about what constitutes harassment, and when we see that the rules are being violated, we remove that content. But it’s not just about doing that, which still means censoring someone, but also creating incentives. One example: what posts to give more value to in the algorithm, what comments to make appear at the top, what privacy settings to offer. There are many ways to try to reduce the exposure of younger people to online bullying. You try to stop it as much as possible, but you also have to be honest: something will always pass. Bullying has been around as long as people have been around. I myself was bullied as a kid. That’s why you have to create tools that allow those who suffer it to protect themselves and take back some power. And parents, what can they do? Education: you need to make sure you talk to your teenage children about the risks. And on identity, it is necessary to ask, do you really know who is who? Being careful and aware of what you share is crucial, because I think it's not just about bullying, but how much exposure you have. How much time, for example, do you spend on the platform? If you set a limit of 20 minutes a day you run less risk than if you have no limit at all. Again, it’s going to be different for every teenager, and parents are going to have to set boundaries and limits. How do you teach adults to use technology in a more conscious way? This is a big question. At Instagram, on the one hand, we want to build a safe platform that connects people. But at the same time, we also need to make sure that we don’t play too strong a role. We don't want to tell people what to think or what to read. Nor decide who you want to follow or what you want your experience to be like. Because your experience will probably be very different from mine. The real question to ask is what gets rewarded on Instagram? Because anything that gets more visibility drives people to post similar content. It is a matter of incentives. In an indirect way, we influence people's behaviors based on what works and what doesn’t work on the platform. We have to be very aware of that. And I come back to the topic of time: one really useful thing for people is to know how much [time] they spend on social [media], because time is a bit like a mirror. We have tools that show you how much time you spend on it, and you can set reminders or limits. With adults, it’s important to give information. One of the biggest vulnerabilities of social media, including Instagram, is the spread of fake news and political manipulation of content. How do we handle this so as not to put democracies at risk? The most immediate answer is that in the U.S. we are moving from third-party fact-checkers to community notes, which are people voting on other people's content. I’m very pleased with that. In the long run, though, I think we are heading toward a world where it is much more difficult to distinguish what is real from what is not. And this goes beyond social media. It’s about the Internet. It's about AI. When you create images on Instagram that are generated by AI, we mark them as such so that everyone knows what they are seeing. In many other platforms, however, it remains possible to create images and videos. We are moving toward a world where people will focus not only on the information, but also on the source. In five or 10 years, we will not be asking, “Is this image real or not?” The question will be, “Do you trust the people who share it?” To many critics, Instagram’s current algorithm is a problem in that it continues to reward posts that are shared the most. Doesn't this risk fueling the spread of sensitive content? First of all, Instagram is different from Facebook or X, platforms where you share content with everyone. On Instagram, you do it only with your friends. Not only that: you post safer topics that generally make content less risky. That, of course, doesn't mean there are no risks. We have two billion users. Inevitably sometimes certain problematic content reaches a lot of people. But we also have whole teams working to identify problems and remove them. On the other hand, when a piece of content is not dangerous but still sensitive or potentially problematic, we make sure that we don’t recommend it or circulate it too much. If a piece of content is very provocative but does not violate the rules, however, we leave it online but do not promote it. In fact, only those who follow that account will be able to see it. And I have to admit that every year the list of sensitive and problematic content gets longer. Today Meta is at the center of an antitrust trial in the United States. How do you envision the future of social media and Instagram? I can’t talk about the trial because I will be testifying in a few weeks, but I think the important thing is this: the basic needs that social media is trying to address have remained the same. Connecting with others, exploring our interests, having fun, entertaining ourselves. I tried to make sure that as Instagram evolved, it also stayed true to these basic needs. But the way we fulfill them will inevitably change. We've gone from posts in the feed to Stories to direct messages. From square photos to immersive videos with sound and graphic elements. But the basic needs, connecting with others and exploring your interests, have remained the same. In the future I think it will change a lot more.

    "title": "Before Blue Origin’s All-Female Flight, The Morning Show Sent a TV Anchor to Space",
    "article_text": "Last week, a curated group of six notable women—includingCBS MorningscohostGayle King—spent 11 minutes in spaceaboard the New Shepard, a rocket developed by theJeff Bezos–ownedBlue Origin. If the scene looked a little familiar, it may be becauseReese Witherspoon’s fictional TV anchor Bradley Jackson made a very similar trek on a 2023 episode of the Apple TV+ dramaThe Morning Show. In the season three premiere, titled “The Kármán Line”—a.k.a. the boundary that delineates space from Earth’s atmosphere—Bradley is launched about 62 miles into space alongside her boss,Billy Crudup’s Cory Ellison, andtech billionairePaul Marks (Jon Hamm). Marks has funded the televised Hyperion One space launch, and hopes to one day acquire the titular morning show’s fictional network, UBA. “After two years of a pandemic and now a war in Ukraine, it’s incredible to look down and see how connected we all are,” Bradley tells viewers from space. In real life, Blue Origin flight NS-31 crew membersKaty PerryandLauren Sánchez,Bezos’s fiancée, also described feeling “connected” upon returning to Earth. While some clocked the parallels betweenThe Morning Showand last week’s flight, series showrunnerCharlotte Stoudt,who took over fromMorning ShowcocreatorKerry Ehrinat the start ofseason three, missed the launch entirely. “I’ll be honest: I did not watch it,” she tellsVanity Fair.“We’re in the middle of post-[production] onseason four, so I’m not watching, really, anything.” This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Stoudt did catchGood Morning AmericahostMichael Strahan’s Blue Origin flightin December 2021—and was inspired to write something similar into her inaugural episode ofThe Morning Show.She was struck by the irony of a “kind of phallic rocket” launching from Texas, the same state that, only three months earlier,bannedmost abortions at about six weeks into a pregnancy. “It seemed the tension was just sitting there,” says Stoudt, “between something that was trying to go up and out, and the women on the ground in Texas who didn’t have rocket fuel, but who were moving back and forth across the border trying to give women some kind of access to reproductive health care.” Stoudt worked reproductive rights into season three’s premiere more overtly as well. After announcing her abortion on air in the first season, Bradley Jackson, who’s now hosting the evening news, chases a story about a Texas woman named Luna who crosses the Mexican border once a month to smuggle abortion pills to women in her state. But network bosses Stella (Greta Lee) and Cory kill the story, hoping to keep Bradley as neutral as possible so she can cover the 2024 election. As a show of solidarity against leadership that she feels is failing,Jennifer Aniston’s Alex Levy volunteers to go to the border in Bradley’s place—leaving her former coanchor to take Alex’s spot broadcasting from space. The episode marked “an incredibly convulsive moment in America: the pandemic, the George Floyd protests, January 6. Emotionally, people felt really unmoored,” says Stoudt. “And to me, the image of a woman floating in zero gravity just sort of felt like that captured something.” When six real women—King, Perry, Sánchez, film producerKerianne Flynn,NASA engineerAisha Bowe,and bioastronautics research scientist and activistAmanda Nguyễn—boarded the privately-owned rocketNew Shepard,“I did notice the presence of Amanda Nguyễn, and it was a reminder of heradvocacy for sexual assault survivors,” says Stoudt. “So apart from the flight, it brought me back to that, and certainly in the current climate, just remembering the challenges of women moving through the justice system.” But Stoudt also thinks that the news cycle surrounding the Blue Origin flight—namely, the rush to coverbacklash to the flight from celebritiesand subsequentdefense of the flightfrom high-profile participants—to be a symptom of a larger media problem. “The current conversation just feels like more of the same in a lot of ways,” she says. “The conversations are Exhibit A of where we are right now.” Many of Blue Origin’s critics have focused on theenvironmental impactof its flights as well as the reportedly high cost of seats on its spacecraft. Blue Origin auctioned off its first seat for $28 million in 2021, according toThe New York Times. Company spokespersonBill KircostoldCNNthat “some passengers” on the April 14 flight flew “free of charge,” but declined to name which crew members. Anyone canreserve their spoton the spacecraft, but they must put down a “fully refundable deposit” of $150,000 to do so. “I’ve seen endless criticism of 5 women doing their space thing,”The View’sAna Navarro-Cárdenaswrote onInstagramlast week. “I wish people would show [the] same energy & focus that anger towards fearlessly denouncingTrump’s abuses of power. Which do affect countless lives in the US and the world.” Stoudt tends to agree. “It’s less to me about drive-by commentary about the flight,” she says. “I’m more interested in the world of things that Bezos is involved in—what’shappening at thePostwith OpenAI[Bezos acquiredThe Washington Postin 2013] and in other newsrooms, how newspapers are trying to stay alive and the choices they’re all making, not just thePost. What questions can you ask that are actually worth asking?” While researching rockets like Blue Origin andElon Musk’s SpaceXfor her series, Stoudt also wondered about the “tremendous amount of leeway” afforded in thebillionaire space race,noting how such experimental flights have beenlargely unregulatedin the United States, calling it “the Wild West of rocket testing.” The Morning Showoften explores how TV news personalities become spokespeople for those larger issues. As the face of a real daily network morning show, Gayle King has addressed the Blue Origin backlash more than some of her crewmates. “Yes. Who did people focus on? You obviously have a bigger target,” says Stoudt. “Talking to the people who inspired the show, it’s so clear that you have two selves [as a news anchor]—the private and the public. I think there can be a lot of internal conflict with those two sides. I wouldn’t want to be so front-facing. That’s hard.” “The fourth estatehas to navigate all these power differentials and then appear or don’t appear to be objective,” says Stoudt. “It’s a really crazy job, and I think it takes a huge toll on people. Most of the time they hide that.” OnThe Morning Show,there’s plenty of internal skepticism about UBA putting one of its top anchors into orbit in order to cozy up to a billionaire. But once the flight actually blasts off, all of the characters seem to be moved by it. Is there room for both skepticism and admiration in thinking about the Blue Origin flight? “I would say we need awe in our lives. We do,” Stoudt begins, trailing off. “There are probably a lot of different ways to achieve that. Let’s put it that way.” Season four ofThe Morning Showis slated to bow later this year, with its premiere episode, titled “My Roman Empire,” scripted by Stoudt andZender Lehmann. “I haven’t started talking about season four yet,” she says. “How would I sum up what we’re talking about?” AI and climate change will both be touched upon, but Stoudt insists that the show’s storylines are inspired less by current events than events that seem to have staying power. “I don’t look at Google at all. I basically just ask, What’s in my headright now?What do I remember about the year’s news stories? Those tend to be what I go to, because there’seither controversy or a lot of emotionaround it.” The show’s upcoming fourth season boasts a bevy of exciting cast additions, from Oscar winnersJeremy IronsandMarion CotillardtoThe Good Place’sWilliam Jackson HarperandBoyd Holbrook.“All these people give our already established characters a run for their money,” says Stoudt. Cotillard plays Celine Dumont, who has been described as a savvy operator from a storied European family. “Just watch the last five minutes of the Édith Piaf movie”—that would beLa Vie En Rose,which won Cotillard the best-actress Oscar in 2008—“and your head will explode again,” says Stoudt. “Marion is truly astonishing, supremely enigmatic, and almost a feline presence.” She’s a great contrast to Holbrook, “a breath of fresh air” on set who plays a “knockabout loudmouth podcaster,” a character description that mayring a few bells. “People will hate him, love him, everything in between,” she adds. Watching an episode ofThe Morning Showshouldn’t feel like listening to a politically slanted podcast, says Stoudt. “You really have to filter [the headlines] through character.… How are you telling a story in a way that is disarming to people? That’s really the test of drama. Did you open people up or not? They can read. They can listen toJoe Rogantalk about Blue Origin. There are plenty of places to hear people opine. But I’m trying to do something else—and I’m not always successful at it. But it’s just about getting people to stop and consider something. Which sounds very Pollyanna, I know. But a lot of these things are life and death.” What would Stoudt most like viewers to consider when watching her characters’ fictional trip to space? “Tension between the people who have a lot of opportunity and means, and the people who may not,” she says. “And that isn’t really about individual characters. It’s not, ‘Is Paul good or bad?’ All the characters on the show are gray. It’s about what the impact of that imbalance of power is—trying to capture tension between those with a voice and those who don’t feel they have one.” Shortly after our conversation, Stoudt shares a final thought regarding her show’s knack for weaving real-world issues into a fictional universe. “The world is full of hot takes, for good and for ill. But each season of this show takes almost two years to write, shoot, and edit,” she says. “So we have to chase something beyond hot takes. We try not to take ourselves too seriously. But the issues we explore, those we take seriously, because they impact real human beings.” HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter Inside Elon Musk’s Grievance-FueledMAGA-morphosis Sinners’ End CreditsExplained The OriginalGirl of the Year Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought Who Is Pete Hegseth’s Wife,Jennifer Rauchet?

    "title": "With NIH Plans for an Autism Registry, RFK Jr.’s Public Health Takeover Grows More Alarming",
    "article_text": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s personal crusade to “make America healthy again” is picking up steam and taking some startling turns. Earlier this week, CBS Newsreports, the director of the National Institutes of HealthJay Bhattacharyasaid that his office is planning to build a tracking system for autistic people in the US, composed of private medical records, including from pharmacies, insurers, and even fitness trackers. The data would reportedly be used by select researchers as part of a series of studies into autism’s origins, which Kennedy, who oversees NIH as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, has ordered. The news of this deeply invasive effort came just days after Kennedy gave a harrowingtalkabout autism, referring to it as an “epidemic” that “destroys” families and children and mischaracterizing autistic people as being unable to hold jobs, have relationships, or pay taxes. Kennedy’s talk contradicted the findings of a new report by the Centers for Disease Control, which found that increased screening and changes to diagnostic criteria have contributed to rising rates of autism in the US. Instead, Kennedy said his department would study the environmental causes of autism, and, it appears, he’s willing to go to troubling lengths to do so. News about NIH’s plans drew swift backlash from both autism and privacy advocates. “The disability community, and many other marginalized communities, have reasonable fears, based in both historical events and in current policy pursued by the administration, of any attempts to create lists of marginalized people,” read astatementby the Autistic Self Advocacy Network. While personal health information often is used for research,Ariana Aboulafia, a disability rights attorney at the Center for Democracy and Technology, said in a statement that collecting it without autistic people’s consent is “dangerous” and “crosses a line in the sand, particularly given longstanding and historical concerns surrounding the creation of registries of people with disabilities.” While this may be the most disturbing development of Kennedy’s term so far, it’s hardly the only way he’s sought to reshape the landscape of public health in America over recent weeks. According to Politico, Kennedy is currentlyconsideringreversing the CDC’s recommendation that children receive COVID-19 shots. On Tuesday, Kennedy alsosaidhe’s working with the food industry to ban certain dyes by 2026. All of that is in addition to the effects of the systematic gutting of HHS staff that Kennedy has overseen. In just the last month, the CDC has reportedlyscrappedplans to help Texas schools control the measles outbreak there, amid layoffs.Accordingto NPR, entire teams focused on car crashes, rape prevention and education, traumatic brain injury and more at the CDC have been let go. And while Kennedy has taken to calling sugar “poison,” he’s also presiding over an FDA that reportedlysuspendedquality control tests for dairy products andpostponeda requirement for companies to trace and remove contaminated food.

    "title": "Prince Louis Gives a Little Tooth, a Lot of Charm in New 7th Birthday Portrait",
    "article_text": "The youngest ofKate MiddletonandPrince William’s three children,Prince Louis, marked his seventh birthday Wednesday, and his proud parents shared birthday wishes, anew photo, and a briefvideo clipof the rambunctious youngest Wales on social media to celebrate along with the world. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. In the video compilation, we’re treated to Louis’s seemingly boundless energy and boyish glee he exhibited during the shoot, complete with him grinning into the camera at close range and even a rare snippet of him speaking. “I can jump down from there!” he announces, pointing, then demonstrates by leaping off a log, thrilled. The cinematographer is not tagged, but from Louis’s sneaky smiles and close proximity to the shooter, there's a non-zero chance that Kate was behind that phone, playing Instagram Mom. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. It's not just the clip that's a change to the family's typical birthday offerings: While the Prince and Princess of Wales routinely share new photos of their children to mark birthdays, there are a few subtle ways that Louis’s photographic celebration breaks with both Wales family tradition, and broader royal family norms. In the portrait, Louis wears an olive green v-neck sweater over a white-and-blue grid patterned collared shirt, paired with a pair of blue jeans. It’s not the casual connotation of denim that is remarkable here, but that his princely knees are covered by the full-length pants. In the British upper classes, boys typically wear short pants until about age 8, stemming from the16th-century concept of “breeching,”when infants would be dressed first in gowns, regardless of gender, before boys graduated to short pants. The transition to full-length trousers was considered a milestone and mark of maturity, withetiquette expertWilliam HansontellingHarper’s Bazaarin 2018that “a pair of trousers on a young boy is considered quite middle class—quite suburban. And no self-respecting aristo or royal would want to be considered suburban.” It’s not the very first time we’ve seen the littlest prince in full trousers—hedonned a dark pair with his suitat the 2024and 2023Christmas carol concerts, perhaps a concession to the cold—but any twitch of differing from royal protocol is noteworthy. Maybe he passed some secret test or very significant arm-wrestling match and has been deemed pants-worthy and grown. The other break from tradition is one more personal to the family: The birthday portrait was taken by photographerJosh Shinner, not Kate. The Princess of Wales is a passionate photographer, and is usually behind the lens for her children’s birthday portraits. She took Louis’sfirst birthday photo(sweater, teeny tiny teeth),second(checkered shirt, rainbow paint-covered hands poised for chaos and mess),third(sweater, special guest star bicycle),fourth(sweater, sand), andsixth(checkered shirt, blink-and-you’ll-miss-it missing lower tooth) birthday pictures. Only this year andLouis’s fifth birthday(sweater, wheelbarrow, mom), when the family released sweet shots of Louis and Princess Kate taken byMillie Pilkington, because how is mom supposed to take the photo when she’s in the photo, has someone else done the photographic honors. Though Shinner is new to the Louis Birthday Photo Hall of Fame, this isn’t the first time he’s captured the Wales family’s likenesses. He was the photographer behind thefamily’s 2023 holiday card, bearing a black-and-white group shot. In anInstagram caption, he called that experience “without doubt one of the most relaxed and enjoyable sittings I’ve ever had.” HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter Inside Elon Musk’s Grievance-FueledMAGA-morphosis Sinners’ End CreditsExplained The OriginalGirl of the Year Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought Who Is Pete Hegseth’s Wife,Jennifer Rauchet?

    "title": "‘Don’t Be Gay’ Is the Next Chapter in the Evolution of Jerrod Carmichael",
    "article_text": "Jerrod Carmichael knows it’s time to log off, and yet…“it’s so fun,” he tellsVanity Fair.“It’s so fun that I can’t do it anymore.” This time last year, Carmichael was often at the center of social media discourse thanks to his HBO docuseries,Jerrod Carmichael Reality Show.The seriesset the internet ablazewith its unflinching and often uncomfortable look at Carmichael’s life as a relatively newly out gay man navigating friendships, family, and a blossoming relationship. “I still check Twitter all the time. I check it every day,” he admits. “But I just can’t do it formeanymore.” If that’s the case, Carmichael may want to go ahead and block his name right now. On Saturday, May 24, the Emmy-winning comedian and provocateur will be back in the spotlight withDon’t Be Gay,his hilarious and vulnerable fourth comedy special with HBO. Taped in one night in New York City and directed byAri Katcher,Don’t Be Gaydives headfirst into Carmichael’s psyche fresh off his docuseries, which was also directed by Katcher. “I’m in this generative phase where it’s like, I have a lot to talk about,” Carmichael says. Don’t Be Gayalso marks Carmichael’s first stand-up special sinceRothaniel, theBo Burnham–directed Emmy-winning comedy special where Carmichaelofficially came out of the closet. “I had been doing stand-up sinceRothaniel,and it was this cathartic thing where I would go up with some immediate problem and work it out,” he tellsVanity Fairin an exclusive interview. ButJerrod Carmichael Reality Showitself “became the immediate issue after the show came out. Of course, I got the Google alerts for myself, and I’m checking Twitter, and it’s a rollercoaster.” His up-and-down relationship with the internet “is actually a more volatile relationship than I’ve had with my family,” he tellsVF. As documented in his reality show, that family includes Joe—Carmichael’s father, who had a second family—and Cynthia, his devout Christian mother who’s struggled with her son’s homosexuality. “The relationship has always been somewhat complicated,” he says. But post-docuseries, things with his parents are apparently looking up. “I think our relationship is… good,” Carmichael says, taking a moment to consider his response. “Every relationship—I mean this in a positive way— is as good as it can be.” While they certainly come up,Don’t Be Gayisn’t really about Joe or Cynthia. It’s about Carmichael navigating his life as a rich, famous, gay Black man, and all that entails. “The special is a lot of thoughts around how I’m seeing myself, because the reality show was that,” he says. “I started writing a lot of material about that—about how I see myself, about masculinity, how I see myself as a man.” Now, he’s somewhat anxiously awaiting the results. “I hope it’s funny. I hope you liked it,” he tells me. “I hope you laughed.” “You know Scarpetta? I fell in love with it during COVID,” Carmichael says. His favorite dish at the tony Madison Avenue Italian restaurant is its classic spaghetti. “The secret is probably just butter,” he says. “But it is very simple, just noodles and sauce, and it’s good spaghetti.” Good spaghetti—solid, satisfying—is precisely what Carmichael wantedDon’t Be Gayto be. Carmichael tested out material for “a year—a year and a half, even—shaping it into a show” at spots like the Comedy Cellar and the Laugh Factory, but also lesser known venues like Comedy Connection in Rhode Island and what he calls “one of the best clubs in the world,” Comedy on State in Madison, Wisconsin. Despite performing at venues all over the country, Carmichael insists he’s never been on an official tour. “It’s always so impulsive,” he says. “They would all just squeeze me in for these last-minute shows that we announced.” That impulsive nature is key to Carmichael’s charm. When he performs live, audience members regularly shout out their immediate reactions to what Carmichael’s describing, leading to off-the-cuff repartee and spur-of-the-moment insights. He also eschews the “stand-up” part entirely. But while sitting down and engaging in impromptu call-and-response with the audience have both become hallmarks of Carmichael’s, you won’t find either inDon’t Be Gay.“This special feels like the first of its kind for me,” he says. “I don’t think I’ve made anything like this before.” Between the reality show and acting in Oscar-winning films likePoor Things, it had been a while since Carmichael performed stand-up. In many ways,Don’t Be Gayfelt like a return for someone who established himself through the club system. But the young man Carmichael once was is not the same man who commands the stage inDon’t Be Gay.“Me and Bo [Burnham] were just talking about that when I started my career, I was holding on to this deep secret about myself,” he says. “So a lot of my stand-up was me throwing grenades everywhere else—a bit chaotic, a lot of contrarian, cynical thoughts. It is who I was as a person.” In his first special, 2014’sSpike Lee–directedLove at the Store, Carmichael describes himself as “a young comic coming out.” (But not like that.) “I wanted it to feel like a night at The Comedy Store,” he says. “It was filmed in the original room. Nobody filmed there at the time, and it was really special to me to do that.” Next came 2017’s8,directed by Burnham, which Carmichael says was like “giving a speech” about “a lot of contrarian views on family and the environment.” Then came hisactualcoming-out special,Rothaniel, which won Carmichael an Emmy for outstanding writing for a variety special. “Rothanielwas me contending with something real, dealing with myself, and learning to tell stories,” he says. Now there’sDon’t Be Gay. “It’s using everything that I’ve learned over the course of my career,” he says. “It does feel like a culmination.” IfRothanielwas Carmichael dipping his toes into what it means to be a queer comedian,Don’t Be Gayfinds him diving in headfirst, with Carmichael divulging intimate details about everything from his open relationship, to his teenage porn preferences, to his Grindr hookups. (Trust me, you’ll never think of Clair Huxtable in the same way again.) “I don’t think anything’s off-limits. There were no rules for this,” he says. “My last special was so emotional. It was something I’d never done before. It was me coming out and doing the scariest thing in the world for me. [Rothaniel] was a lot about the audience, and me being afraid of being seen and facing the crowd. This special is more about my excitement to share jokes and ideas with a crowd.” The first joke comes in the title of the special. For those clutching their pearls, don’t worry: “The title is a joke,” he says. But like most of Carmichael’s material, there’s something deeper and more vulnerable at play as well. “It also encapsulates an interior monologue that has been with me for a large part of my life,” he says. When they read the title, “some people may think it’s anAndrew Tatevideo,” he jokes—but that’s just the price of doing business. “Stand-up comedy is a very masculine performance,” he says. “I almost didn’t realize until I came out just how much stand-up comedy is about gay shit. You’d be hard-pressed to watch any special done by a straight man where a large percentage of the punch line isn’t something gay. A lot of stand-up comedy is like, ‘Well, at least I’m not gay.’ Watch any special. It is insane.” Thankfully, Carmichael and his comedy have evolved to a place beyond gay panic. That evolution took a lot of work. “I’ve been really on my David R. HawkinsLetting Go,Brené Brown, Ellen Langer, finding-peace mission lately,” he says. “So I’ve applied that to every area of my life.” WhenDon’t Be Gayhits HBO and Max, he’ll have his first real test—at least as far as social media is concerned. “It’s been close to a year now where I stopped seeking myself all over the internet, searching my name and things,” he says. That certainly hasn’t been easy. “The internet is in my pocket. It’s like, how can you not? It’s crazy not to look and search for yourself, but I don’t think that I can.” And getting offline isn’t simply a way to protect himself. “The positive comments can also inflate the ego and affect the work,” he says. “For the sake of writing, for the sake of creating, I don’t think that I can, or I don’t think that I should anymore. And it’ll be hard.” But even the most disciplined person can’t control everything. “I’ll still have friends that’ll send me stuff,” Carmichael jokes. “My friends don’t care.” HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter Inside Elon Musk’s Grievance-FueledMAGA-morphosis Sinners’ End CreditsExplained The OriginalGirl of the Year Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought Who Is Pete Hegseth’s Wife,Jennifer Rauchet?

    "title": "Summer TV Preview: 20 Shows to Watch in 2025",
    "article_text": "Do we really need a full slate of summer 2025 TV shows when we already have a new season ofAnd Just Like That…to look forward to? (An early contender for thebest TV show of 2025, period!) Possibly not—but it can’t hurt to diversify. This year, warmer weather will bring the return of not just Carrie Bradshaw, but Wednesday Adams and Carmy Berzatto as well. We’ll also see a non-Successionsequel from a bunch of the minds behindSuccession;a historical epic about Hawaii fromJason Momoa;and a spiritual successor toGirls,created byLena Dunhamand starringMeg Stalter.Below, read more about the 20 summer shows—that is, debuts between Memorial Day weekend and Labor Day weekend—we’re putting on our queue. Premiere date:May 23Network:NetflixNoteworthy cast:Nick Kroll, John Mulaney, Jessi Klein, Maya Rudolph, Jordan Peele, Ayo Edebiri As we all know, adolescence eventually comes to an end. And so willBig Mouth,Netflix’s animated comedy about the trials and tribulations of puberty, starringNick KrollandJohn Mulaney.The profane show is returning for its eighth and final season sometime in 2025—and let’s hope the writers find a way to get six-time Emmy winnerMaya Rudolph,who plays Connie the Hormone Monstress, to say “bubble bath” one last time. —Chris Murphy Premiere date:May 25Network:Adult SwimNoteworthy cast:Ian Cardoni, Harry Belden, Chris Parnell, Spencer Grammer Adult Swim’s tentpole franchise soldiers on once more without cocreatorJustin Roiland,who left the show after being charged withfelony domestic violencein 2023. (The charges were dismissed, though Roiland was lateraccused of sexual misconductin anNBC Newsinvestigation; his lawyer called those allegations “false and defamatory.”) Its strike-delayed next season promises more interdimensional hijinks, perhaps with anEaster-themed episodethrown in for variety’s sake.—Hillary Busis Premiere date:May 28Network:FX/HuluNoteworthy cast:Malik Elassal, Lucy Freyer, Jack Innanen, Amita Rao, Owen Thiele This comedy used to be calledSnowflakes,which should give us some sense of what to expect here. It sounds like a Gen Z–focused take on the classic hangout show, revolving around what the network calls “a group of 20-somethings in New York trying to be good people, despite being neither ‘good’ nor ‘people’ yet.” And it’s executive-produced by Nick Kroll, who’s learned a lot about the art of depicting growing pains over eight seasons ofBig Mouth.—H.B. Premiere date:May 29Network:MaxNoteworthy cast:Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon, Kristin Davis At the end of season two, Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) left her beloved apartment so she could move forward in her relationship with Aidan (John Corbett). We can expect the next season of the HBO hit to follow her into this next big step. The next season will also see the return of starsCynthia NixonandKristin Davis,along with some new guest additions, withMehcad BrooksandLogan Marshall-Greenjoining the show. There will, however, be a Che Diaz–size hole in the show, asSara Ramirezwill not returnto reprise their role as the show’s most divisive character.—Rebecca Ford Premiere date:May 29Network:Prime VideoNoteworthy cast:Jessica Biel, Elizabeth Banks, Corey Stoll, Kim Dickens This female-focused limited series based on a twisty best-selling literary thriller somehow doesnotstarNicole Kidman.Instead, we’ve got TV vet Biel and actor-director Banks stepping in as siblings with a complicated history working together to solve a murder close to home. Executive producerCraig Gillespie(I, Tonya; Pam & Tommy) might inject a bit of whimsy into the proceedings, though this show seems less likely to feature a talking penis voiced byJason Mantzoukas.—H.B. Premiere date:May 31Network:HBONoteworthy cast:Steve Carell, Jason Schwartzman, Ramy Youssef, Cory Michael Smith This HBO original is the first big post-Successionouting forJesse Armstrong, a seven-time Emmy winner for that canonical show. He’s brought much of theSuccessionteam along—the list of producers includesFrank Rich, Lucy Prebble, Will Tracy,andMark Mylod—for another black comedy about billionaires and the lives they destroy. Vital supporting detail: Schwartzman’s character is apparently named “Souper.”—H.B. Premiere date:June 4Network:Apple TV+Noteworthy cast:Owen Wilson, Peter Dager, Marc Maron, Mariana Treviño, Lilli Kay Owen Wilsonstars in this golf comedy as a burned-out former pro who never amounted to much, and now has even less going on. He has lost both his wife and his job at a sports supply store—but he sees a shot at redemption in his future if he can attach himself to a young up-and-comer whose talent he can help refine.—Anthony Breznican Premiere date:June 18Network:Apple TV+Noteworthy cast:Leighton Meester, Kristine Froseth, Christina Hendricks Apple’s late-19th-century take onGossip Girlis back for more frothy fun based on Edith Wharton’s posthumously released, unfinished final novel. Given the limits of its source material, season two seems set to chart its own path forward as the titular gang venture out in pursuit of love and prosperity in London. And speaking ofGossip Girl:Meester joins this season as a yet-undisclosed character, someone the girls probably willnotwant to cross.—H.B. Premiere date:June 19Network:NetflixNoteworthy cast:Holt McCallany, Maria Bello, Jake Weary, Melissa Benoist This Netflix joint comes from the mind ofKevin Williamson,but its description sounds a little less likeDawson’s Creekand more likeYellowstonein North Carolina. It revolves around a powerful family which faces the dissolution of their local empire, and a mother and son (Bello and Weary) who “venture into the deep end to keep the family businesses afloat,” per Netflix. The show’s apparently based on true events, though the network is being coy about which events, exactly, those might be. Maybe we should steel ourselves for aMurdaugh-type situation?—H.B. Premiere date:June 27Network:NetflixNoteworthy cast:Lee Jung-jae We only haveLee Jung-jaelisted as a noteworthy cast member, because we have no idea who else might make it to season three of the South Korean juggernaut series—about desperate people competing in a series of deadly games. After all, season two won’t even arrive on Netflix until the end of December 2024. But a third season is already in the works, said to be the final installment of the series. We can probably expect some resolutions, though creatorHwang Dong-hyukisn’t exactly known for happy endings. Whatever seasons twoandthree bring, they are both likely to be major television events.—Richard Lawson Premiere date:June TBDNetwork:HBONoteworthy cast:Carrie Coon, Morgan Spector, Cynthia Nixon, Christine Baranski The Gilded Agequickly became an audience favorite over the last few years, earning six Emmy nominations for its second season. In its third season, theJulian Fellowes–created period piece will continue to follow the wealthy families and social climbers of New York with the return of stars like Carrie Coon,Morgan Spector, Cynthia Nixon,andChristine Baranski.Plus, we’re getting some new faces played by the likes ofPhylicia Rashad,Merritt Wever,andBill Camp,who are sure to shake up the show’s volatile social dynamics.—R.F. Premiere date:August 1Network:Apple TV+Noteworthy cast:Jason Momoa, Temuera Morrison, Cliff Curtis Who among us is going to sniff at the prospect of some mo’ Jason Momoa? This nine-episode historical series will tackle the true story of the warring kingdoms of Hawaii and their unification in the early 19th century. Momoa, born in Honolulu himself and invested in telling the tale from the Native perspective, plays a warrior who comes back from his travels to find his homeland in upheaval. Will the series be bloody? One of the episodes is titled “Day of Spilled Brains,” so we’re going to go withyes.—Jeff Giles Premiere Date:August 6Network:NetflixNoteworthy cast:Jenna Ortega, Emma Myers, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Luis Guzmán, Fred Armisen, Steve Buscemi WednesdaybecameNetflix’s most popular show of all timefollowing its November 2022 debut, and itssophomore season—which premieres its first half on August 6, and its second September 3—is finally upon us.Jenna Ortegareprises her titular role as the angsty adolescent daughter of the delightfully macabre Addams family. In season two, she’s reunited with mother Morticia (Catherine Zeta-Jones), father Gomez (Luis Guzmán), and best friend Enid (Emma Myers), as well asFred Armisen’sUncle Fester. And a few new faces have come to populate Wednesday’s gothic orbit, includingChristopher Lloyd,Haley Joel Osment, Joanna Lumley,andreportedlyevenLady Gagaherself. Not much is known about the exact plot; only that the season’s premiere episode, written by series creatorsAlfred GoughandMiles Millarand directed byTim Burton,is called “Here We Woe Again.”—Savannah Walsh Premiere date:August 8Network:StarzNoteworthy cast:Harriet Slater, Jamie Roy, Hermione Corfield, Jeremy Irvine Before Claire and Jamie began an epic romance that would span time and space, their parents lived out their own love stories—presumably with slightly less time travel. As Starz’s flagship series comes to an end, the network will launch this prequel set alternately in the 18th-century Scottish Highlands and World War I–era Europe. There will be blood; there will also be bodice-ripping.—H.B. Premiere date:August 21Network:MaxNoteworthy cast:John Cena, Frank Grillo, Tim Meadows The first season of thisSuicide Squadspin-off wound up being asurprisingly good time, thanks to the ever-game Cena and the creative mind ofJames Gunn.All eight episodes of season two were written by Gunn as well, which seems like a good sign; theSupermandirector also helmed a few of them. Maybe this run will end with Cena’s antihero finally achieving peace on Earth, by any means necessary.—H.B. Premiere date:Summer TBDNetwork:NetflixNoteworthy cast:Megan Stalter and Will Sharpe Too Muchis the first show that Lena Dunham has created since 2018’sCamping,her underwhelmingGirlsfollow-up—and her first-ever series without former writing partnerJenni Konner.Instead, the eight-time Emmy nominee has joined forces with her husband, the British musicianLuis Felber,for a rom-com that bears some resemblance to her own story: A young woman unhappy in New York moves to London for a fresh start, then strikes up a swift, heated connection with a local. Dunham’s return to TV feels exciting enough, but her casting of two breakouts from HBO favorites stands out the most:Hacks’Megan StalterandThe White Lotus’sWill Sharpe.—David Canfield Premiere date:Summer TBDNetwork:FX/HuluNoteworthy cast:Jeremy Allen White, Ayo Edebiri, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach After two universally acclaimed, broadly popular seasons,The Bearalienated viewers with a third season that waslight on plot and heavy on experimentation. Still, it contained a few gems, including episodes centered onLiza Colón-Zayas’s andAbby Elliott’s characters, and left us with a few small but potent cliff-hangers that may get the show back on track for season four (some of which has already been filmed). In this high-pressure culinary milieu, the impact of a critic’s mysterious review, or of Sydney (Ayo Edebiri) leaving Carmy (Jeremy Allen White) and the gang behind, could be all we need for a return to tragicomic, stressful form. —D.C. Premiere date:Summer TBDNetwork:NetflixNoteworthy cast:Unknown An adult animated comedy fromRaphael Bob-Waksberg,creator of the lauded seriesBoJack Horseman,Long Story Shorttakes a look at one family over a span of many years. One would expect some pathos to sneak in alongside the comedy, much as it did onBoJack.We don’t know much about this beyond what little Netflix has said in press releases, but fans of Bob-Waksberg (and ofBoJackillustratorLisa Hanawalt’s artwork) will no doubt put this series at the top of their 2025 must-watch list.—R.L. Premiere date:Summer TBDNetwork:Paramount+ With ShowtimeNoteworthy cast:Michael C. Hall It’s possible you believe that Dexter Morgan is dead. For evidence, you might point to the fact that when we saw him last, inDexter: New Blood,he was bleeding to death—plus, there’s the fact thatNew BloodshowrunnerClyde Phillipshas been quoted as saying, “I have three words for you:Dexter is dead.” And sure, it’s a convincing case. Yet here comesResurrection,which is set right after the events ofNew Blood.Has Dexter actually been resurrected? Is his son stepping into his murderous shoes? Has anyone ever stayed dead if they could potentially make a corporation money? —J.G. Premiere date:Summer TBDNetwork:FX/HuluNoteworthy cast:Sydney Chandler, Timothy Olyphant, Essie Davis, Alex Lawther In space, no one can hear you scream—and that’s true of your couch as well, assuming you’re alone. The venerable horror franchise comes to the small screen via FX showrunning vetNoah Hawley,a skilled scribe of quirky noir (Fargo) and trippy sci-fantasy (Legion). It dramatizes what happens when the titular creature vaults from space and crash-lands on the titular planet. And if the trailer is any indication, it’s going to bevery, very scary.—H.B.

    "title": "Tesla May Be in Even Worse Shape Than We Thought",
    "article_text": "On Tuesday, Tesla, the embattled electric vehicle company,sharedthat profits had plunged a whopping 71% from the year before, sending its stock price, which has already been in free fall, sinking even lower. This, no doubt, has a lot to do with the widespread protests of CEOElon Muskand his chainsaw-wielding work at the Department of Government Efficiency over the last few months. The company’s chief financial officer even acknowledged as much in the earnings call,saying“the negative impact of vandalism and unwarranted hostility towards our brand and our people had an impact in certain markets.” So it’s especially curious that Tesla’s stock price rallied Wednesday, after Musk told investors that he would soon step away from Washington and devote more time to Tesla. \"My time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly,\" Musksaidon the call. \"I think I'll continue to spend a day or two per week on government matters for as long as the president would like me to do so, and as long as it is useful.\" Musk admitted there’s been \"some blowback for the time that I’ve been spending in government,” but dismissed the protests as the work of paid groups and chalked up Tesla's troubles to the “macro” environment. “When there is economic uncertainty, people generally want to pause on doing a major capital purchase like a car,” he said in response to a question about Tesla's brand damage. “Absent macro issues, we don’t see any reduction in demand.” Musk insisted Tesla has been “on the ragged edge of death” before. “This is not one of those times,” he said. Investors, at least, seem convinced that Musk will manage to pull Tesla back from the brink as he has done in the past. \"If Musk leaves the White House there will be permanent brand damage,” Wedbush Securities analystDaniel Iveswrote in a noteaccordingtoUSA Today, “but Tesla will have its most important asset and strategic thinker back as full time CEO to drive the vision and the long term story will not be altered.” But this is not like all of those other times. Musk’s work forDonald Trumpboth before and after the election has so tarnished his own personal brand—and by proxyTesla’s—that more than 50% of registered voters have a negative view of the world’s richest man, according to an NBC Newspoll. Just three years ago, that figure hovered below 25%. It's hard to imagine that people will forgive and forget so quickly or that the person whose reputation has helped tank the company's fortunes is also the best positioned to save it.

    "title": "A Beautiful Mess: Carrie Fisher’s Brave Brilliance",
    "article_text": "“If my life wasn’t funny it would just be true,” Carrie Fisher writes in her delightful 2008 memoirWishful Drinking, “and that is unacceptable.” The multi-talented Fisher was many things: an actress appearing in classics likeStar Wars,Shampoo,The Burbs, andWhen Harry Met Sally; a beloved guest star on shows includingSex and The City,Catastrophe,and30 Rock;and a brilliant writer who was known as the best script doctor in Hollywood. In Fisher’s short, snappy memoirs—Wishful Drinking, 2011’sShockaholic,and 2016’sThe Princess Diarist—the ultimate nepo baby tells the story of her operatic life like she’s talking to an old friend, with bracing honesty, and zingy one liners. “I confide in everyone,” she confesses inThe Princess Diarist.“I have no restricted private self, reserved specifically for certain trusted special people. I trust and mistrust anyone.” ‘Wishful Drinking’ by Carrie Fisher Amazon Bookshop ‘Shockaholic’ by Carrie Fisher Amazon Bookshop ‘The Princess Diarist’ by Carrie Fisher Amazon Bookshop Told in a stream-of-consciousness style that, yes, sometimes gets a bit exhausting, Fisher recounts her lifelong battle with bipolar disorder and drug addiction (she nicknames her mania “Rollicking Roy” and her depression “Sediment Pam”) in humorous and at times heartbreaking detail. Well aware of her own eccentricity, Fisher is generous to those who inhabit the strange world of showbiz, likening herself to her friendShirley MacLaine:both of them, she says, were “war reporters on the front line of celebrity.” Most importantly, Fisher humanizes mental illness and drug addiction, seemingly at peace with the fact that her struggles would be of the lifelong variety. “While the place that I've arrived at in my life may not precisely be everyone's idea of heavenly,” she writes inWishful Drinking, “I could swear sometimes—if I'm quiet enough—I can hear the angels sing. Either that or I've screwed up my medication.” “I was born on October 21, 1956. This makes me quite old—half a century and change,” Fisher writes inWishful Drinking. “I was born in Burbank, California . . . to simple folk. People of the land. No, actually my father was a famous singer, and you wanna hear something really cool? My mother is a movie star. She’s an icon. A gay icon, but you take your iconic stature where you can.” The star wasDebbie Reynolds; the crooner was Eddie Fisher. This self-described clumsy and awkward child knew her life wasn’t normal from the start. “When two celebrities mate, something like me is the result,” she writes. “I grew up visiting sets, playing on backlots, and watching movies being made. As a consequence, I find that I don’t have what could be considered a conventional sense of reality.” When Carrie was just a toddler, Eddie Fisher left Reynolds for the widow of his best friend, producer Mike Todd—a woman who just happened to beElizabeth Taylor. “He consoled her with flowers,” Fisher quips, “and he ultimately consoled her with his penis.” Fisher became the ultimate absentee dad. Fisher and her brother,Todd, grew up with Reynolds and her second husband, Harry Karl (a man who, according to Fisher, spent most of his time farting and watching his multiple TVs). They lived in a grand mansion Fisher dubbed “the embassy.” The siblings worshiped their eccentric movie star mother—“the funniest, the prettiest, the kindest, the most talented”—and Fisher longed to be as beautiful as she. But when Fisher realized her looks would never be as conventionally gorgeous as Reynolds, she decided to be something else entirely. “If I wasn’t going to be pretty, maybe I could be funny or smart—someone past caring,” she writes. “So far past caring you couldn’t even see it with a telescope.” “Forty Three Years ago, George Lucas ruined my life,” Fisher writes inWishful Drinking. “And I mean that in the nicest possible way.” After singing in her mother’s chorus at fifteen and studying at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London, Fisher's big break came when she was cast as Princess Leia in George Lucas’sStar Warsat the age of nineteen. Still carrying a whiff of a fake British accent, Fisher hated Leia’s iconic hairstyle and was bemused when Lucas told her she couldn’t wear a bra because “there’s no underwear in space.” InThe Princess Diarist,Fisher also reveals that she had an on-set affair with her very married co-starHarrison Ford. But Fisher’s most fascinatingStar Warsmusings dissect the absurdity of the fame and fandom that the franchise wrought. She seems particularly tickled with the amount of merchandise made in her likeness, from Princess Leia Pez dispensers to the Princess Leia figurine an ex once stuck pins in as a makeshift voodoo doll. “I saw yet another Leia figurine recently at one of those comic book conventions—which yes, I go to when I’m lonely,” she writes. “Anyway, this doll was on a turnstile. And when it got to a particular place on the turnstile, you could see up my dress, to my anatomically correct—though shaved—galaxy snatch.” As for the $800 Princess Leia sex doll? Fisher admits to owning one. “If ever anyone tells me to go fuck myself,” she writes. “I can actually get the doll and give it a whirl.” “I used to refer to my drug use as putting the monster in the box,” Fisher writes inWishful Drinking.“I wanted to be less so I took more—simple as that.” With her mental illness undiagnosed for years, by her early 20s Fisher was abusing drugs of all kinds—especially hallucinogens. “My mother started to become worried about my obviously ever-increasing drug ingestion,” Fisher writes. “So she ended up doing what any concerned parent would. She calledCary Grant.” Grant, who famously took LSD during a course of therapy sessions in the 1960s, dutifully gave Fisher a call. Fisher admits to being truly star-struck by Grant (a rarity for her), but was still clever enough to convince him she did not have an acid problem. ( “I did have an opiate problem,” she writes, “but frankly that was none of Cary Grant’s fucking business.”) Instead, they spent an hour gossiping aboutChevy Chase, whom they both disliked. Amazingly, this would not be the last time Fisher heard from Grant. In 1981, Fisher’s father, Eddie, saw Grant at the funeral of Princess Grace (whom Carrie claims her father didn’t know). Eddie asked the actor to help him with his daughter’s acid problem. Fisher writes: So here we go again. Poor Cary Grant (I’m sure he’s very rarely been called that) gets back from the funeral and in due course calls me again to discuss my issue with slamming acid. Well, if I was embarrassed the first time he called, this time I was completely humiliated. Unsurprisingly, Grant’s intervention was not enough to scare Fisher straight. Finding humor in even the most painful of times, Fisher’s first overdose a few years later inspired her best-selling novelPostcards From The Edgein 1987. “The doctor that pumped my stomach sent me flowers,” she writes. “With a note that read: I can tell that you are a very warm and sensitive person. All from the contents of my stomach! I was tempted to marry him so I could tell people how we met.” “Years ago, there were tribes that roamed the earth, and every tribe had a magic person,” Fisher writes inWishful Drinking. “Well, now, as you know, all the tribes have disappeared, but every so often you meet a magic person, and every so often, you meet someone from your tribe. Which is how I felt when I metPaul Simon. Paul and I had a secret handshake of shared sensibility. We understood each other perfectly. Obviously, we didn’t always agree, but we understood the terms of our disagreements.” In 1978, Shelley Duvall introduced Fisher to the musical superstar, who had been Fisher’s hero since high school. The two highly-strung intellectuals began a turbulent, passionate, on-again-off-again twelve year relationship (including a brief marriage in 1983) “with lots of words, big words,” as Fisher recalls. Some of the tenderest and most scathing sections of Fisher’s memoirs focus on her memories of Simon, and she seems to view the numerous songs he wrote about her (including several on the iconic albumGraceland) with a mixture of pride and annoyance. Simon saw her maybe a bit too clearly, and a bit too cruelly. “If you can get Paul Simon to write a song about you, do it,” she writes. “Because he is so brilliant. Anyway, one of the lyrics in that song goes like this: She is like a top/She cannot stop…And I’m afraid I’ll be taken/ Abandoned and forsaken/In her cold coffees…Yup I’m a bitch.” The twin flames finally split in the early 1990s, both exhausted from their turbulent entanglement. “Mike Nichols used to say we were two flowers, no gardener,” Fisher writes. “No one was minding the relationship.” “I don’t hate hardly ever, and when I love, I love for miles and miles,” Fisher writes inShockaholic.“A love so big it should either be outlawed or it should be a capital with its own currency.” Fisher’s writing bears out this statement. She is enormously kind about her partner, the mega-agentBryan Lourd,who left her for a man. Fisher also became close to her ex-stepmother Elizabeth Taylor, in the most screwball of ways. In the mid-1990s, Taylor invited Fisher and her daughter,Billie(who’s now a successful actress herself), to an Easter egg hunt on the grounds of her Bel Air mansion. Once there, Fisher confronted Taylor about a piece of gossip: Fisher had heard that at a recent dinner party, Taylor had been bad-mouthing Reynolds. In true diva fashion, Taylor denied this and walked away, only to march back up Fisher. “I’m going to push you into the pool,” she told Fisher dramatically. Never one to back down from a challenge, Fisher dared her to do it. And so, Taylor pushed a fully clothed Fisher into the pool. When a laughing Fisher emerged from the water, all her decades-long animosity had evaporated. “When I stood up, we slung our arms around each other’s shoulders, laughing riotously—she largely dry, and me soaked to the skin,” Fisher writes. “By then people had begun to gather around us, cheering. Around us! Elizabeth Taylor and me.” In the last years of his life, Fisher also forgave and became close to her father, whose womanizing and drug addiction had ruined his career. Although many of Fisher’s sharpest barbs are thrown in Eddie’s direction (she quips that her father's autobiography,Been There, Done That, should have been titledBeen There, Done Them), she is very clear that her “adorable,” deeply flawed father loved her. And she loved him. After he died in 2010, Fisher inherited Eddie’s large diamond pinky ring. She and her siblingsJoelyandTriciabelieved the jewelry was worth thousands. Then Fisher discovered the stone was, fittingly, a fake. “He genuinely meant to give bona fide diamonds of only the finest color, cut, and clarity,” Fisher writes. “Ultimately [he] was only able to offer cubic zirconium.” “When you are a survivor, in order to be a really good one, you have to keep getting in trouble to show off your gift,” Fisher writes inWishful Drinking. Fisher would valiantly struggle and thrive, with long periods of sobriety in between occasional relapses. She also worked tirelessly on her mental health, and in later years found enormous relief in electroconvulsive therapy, which she promotes extensively inShockaholic. “ECT has forced me to rediscover what amounts to the sum total of my life,” she writes. “I find that a helluva lot of it fills me with a kind of giddy gratitude.” A famous party thrower who filled her home with Hollywood friends and family, Fisher seems to have found many moments of joy despite the challenges she faced. And most importantly, she never lost her belief in the power of humor. When Billie told her mother that she also wanted to be a writer, Carrie had some advice: “I say…’you have tons of material. Your mother is a manic-depressive drug addict, your father is gay, your grandmother tap dances, and your grandfather shot speed!’ And my daughter laughs and laughs and laughs, and I say, ‘Baby, the fact you know that’s funny is going to save your whole life.’’’ As always, Fisher’s mother and brother were there offering support in their own zany way. “She was upset about my drug addiction—what mother wouldn’t be,” Fisher writes. “But on some level she wasn’t as upset as she was with my failure to do a nightclub act.” Carrie Fisherdied on December 27, 2016, of cardiac arrest after a drug relapse. Debbie Reynoldsdied the next day. Always fascinated by death, Fisher had already pictured the media coverage surrounding her demise, with typical irony and wit. As she wrote inShockaholic: “What you’ll have of me after I journey to that great Death Star in the sky is an extremely accomplished daughter, a few books, and a picture of a stern-looking girl wearing some kind of metal bikini lounging on a giant drooling squid, behind a newscaster informing you of the passing of Princess Leia after a long battle with her head.” HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter Inside Elon Musk’s Grievance-FueledMAGA-morphosis Sinners’ End CreditsExplained The OriginalGirl of the Year Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought Who Is Pete Hegseth’s Wife,Jennifer Rauchet?

    "title": "Former Child Actor Sophie Nyweide Faced Personal Struggles Before Her Death at 24",
    "article_text": "Sophie Nyweide, a former child actor cast inDarren Aronofsky’sNoahandNoah Baumbach’sMargot at the Wedding,died on Monday, April 14, her family wrote in an onlineobituary. She was 24. No cause of death has been shared, but authorities in Bennington, Vermont, tellVanity Fairthat they are “investigating this as a possible unintentional overdose.” “Sophie was a beloved daughter, granddaughter, sister, friend, and new aunt,” the family wrote in her obituary. “Creative, athletic, and wise beyond her years, Sophie accomplished so much in the time she danced upon earth.” The Vermont native, who split her time between Burlington and New York City, was only six years old when she played the title role in her first movie,Bella.Nyweide went on to appear in nearly a dozen other titles, including 2009’sMammoth,an indie family drama in which she portrayed the daughter ofGael García BernalandMichelle Williams.“She seemed happiest on a movie set, becoming someone else,” her obituary read. “Sophie was a kind and trusting girl,” her family wrote. “Often this left her open to being taken advantage of by others. She wrote and drew voraciously, and much of this art depicts the depth she had, and it also represents the pain she suffered. Many of her writings and artwork are road maps of her struggles and traumas. Even with those road maps, diagnoses, and her own revelations, those closest to her, plus therapists, law enforcement officers, and others who tried to help her, are heartbroken their efforts couldn’t save her from her fate. She self-medicated to deal with all the trauma and shame she held inside, and it possibly led to her death. She repeatedly said she would ‘handle it’ on her own and was compelled to reject the treatment that might possibly have saved her life.” The Bennington Police Department is conducting an investigation into Nyweide’s death, with final autopsy and toxicology reports from the Vermont Office of the Chief Medical Examiner still pending. (Vanity Fairhas also reached out to the Vermont Office of the Chief Medical Examiner for comment.) On Monday, April 14, at approximately 4:10 a.m., authorities were dispatched to a wooded area along the banks of a river in Bennington due to a report of an unresponsive female, a representative for the agency tellsVF.First responders attempted livesaving measures, but Nyweide was later pronounced dead at the scene. An individual who was present at the time of her death, and called 911, is cooperating with investigators. Anyone with further information is encouraged to contact the Bennington Police Department. “Sophie. A life ended too soon. May it not be in vain. May we all learn from her brief life on earth and do better. Yes, we must all protect our children and do better,” the obituary concluded. The family has asked that, in lieu of gifts, people donate toRAINN, the anti-sexual-violence organization, in Nyweide’s name.

    "title": "YouTube, at 20, Has Hosted 20 Billion Videos and Launched Superstars. It Wants More—Including Some Prestige",
    "article_text": "Drive five miles north of the Hollywood sign and you’ll find yourself in Burbank, where they actually make the dreams for the dream factory.Casablanca,Reservoir Dogs,andEuphoriawere all shot here. Today, tucked inside an unmarked warehouse in a particularly drab patch of the city, Rhett McLaughlin and Link Neal are filming their own contribution to entertainment history: a segment called “Will It Dip?” for their delightfully goofy and imaginative YouTube seriesGood Mythical Morning.After taste-testing a soupy dip made out of mashed Girl Scout cookies, the duo are presented with a bowl of black goo served under glass. As soon as McLaughlin removes the lid, thick smoke fills the set, which is designed to look like a ramshackle fishing lodge. When the cameras stop rolling, Neal tells the show’s culinary producer, “I do feel like you were trying to kill us a little bit.” McLaughlin and Neal are friends from small-town North Carolina who met in first-grade detention. They experimented with making films as teens and, at 21, McLaughlin auditioned forThe Real World.Unsuccessfully. In 2006 the guys were shooting comic skits and songs after work in a basement when they realized that YouTube, still very much in its infancy, could be a great outlet for their stuff. These days they operate out of this 17,000-square-foot maze, which comes complete with writers rooms, test kitchens, and a prop department full of bizarro pieces from episodes past and future. The Mythical company now makes multiple series and podcasts, as well as having a food website, merchandising, and an investment fund for the next generation of digital creators. Their YouTube channels have a combined audience of 30 million subscribers, andGood Mythical Morningalone has twice as many viewers aged 18 to 34 as Seth, Stephen, Jimmy, and Jimmy combined. What more could McLaughlin and Neal want? Hollywood awards and a little of the prestige that comes with them, for starters. “Obviously it’s cool in LA when you’ve got a shelf with an Emmy on it,” says McLaughlin, grinning through his thicket of facial hair. “But the main reason is, the awards are designed to recognize what is resonating culturally. Well, we are resonating culturally, so we should be a part of that conversation. Shows that get the awards—there’s this sense that these are therealshows. And we want to be on the same stage because we are competing with them directly.” “You want to be treated like a real boy?” I say. “Exactly!” McLaughlin says, laughing. “It’s an expansion of what entertainment is,” Neal adds. “We’re not trying to kill anything. We’re just trying to be invited to the party.” Speaking of parties, YouTube is celebrating its 20th birthday this year, and no one could blame it for feeling jubilant. The platform—which has hosted 20 billion videos since launching in 2005— has overcome rampant underestimation and sporadic demonization to become the second-most visited website in the world (behind its parent company, Google). Two and a half billion people watch YouTube videos every month, and its content has partially, or completely, replaced traditional television viewing for many of them. Smart TVs have made the site so easily accessible that television screens have now surpassed phones and laptops as the primary way people watch it in the US. YouTube wants to be taken seriously in Hollywood, and theyarebeing taken very seriously. Not so much as a creator of content but as a distraction from the content that Hollywood produces.” Where a previous generation of families might’ve gathered around the electronic hearth to watchHow I Met Your MotherorSurvivor,they now communally binge Amelia Dimoldenberg’s swoon-worthyChicken Shop Dateor Michelle Khare’s daredevil docuseriesChallenge Accepted. Khare takes on intense challenges for her series—anything from training to be a chess grandmaster to earning a black belt in 90 days. When she premiered the latter 77-minute episode at the Montclair Film Festival last fall, multiple families approached her. “It wasn’t: ‘Hey, I’m here because my kids like you.’ It was: ‘We’re here because when an episode ofChallenge Accepteddrops, we all sit down on Friday night to watch it together.” All of which fuels Hollywood’s long love-hate relationship with the platform. “YouTube wants to be taken seriously in Hollywood, and theyarebeing taken very seriously,” says David R. Craig, a former TV executive turned USC professor and coauthor ofSocial Media Entertainment: The New Intersection of Hollywood and Silicon Valley.“Not so much as a creator of content but as a distraction from the content that Hollywood produces.” The anxiety has been hanging in the air for years. Back in 2020, Netflix cofounder Reed Hastings asked me rhetorically, “Does creative quality on YouTube just go up and up and up so that eventually it meets [viewers’] needs? Do we get outcompeted by some combination of user-generated [content]?” He called platforms like YouTube and TikTok his streamer’s biggest “threat-slash-opportunity.” Netflix was also a tech company and relative newcomer at this point, one that had only started presenting original series in 2013. (RememberHouse of Cards?) Its own entry into what was soon dubbed “the streaming wars” sent the industry into convulsions. A kind of détente between Hollywood and YouTube emerged as executives realized how useful the platform was for distributing their own wares, whether clips fromSaturday Night Liveor blockbuster movie teasers. “I speak with all the studio heads on a regular basis, and they recognize YouTube as one of their most important partners,” YouTube CEO Neal Mohan tells me. The studios are eager to create “new business opportunities for their franchises and IP on YouTube,” as well as reaching their fandoms, he says. And in the strictest sense, they aren’t competitors, since YouTube doesn’t actually produce any of their programming—it just provides a stage for creators to do their thing, and shares the advertising money with many of them. Still, entertainment execs quietly derided YouTube for much of its existence, seeing it as little more than a farm team providing poachable raw talent, including Justin Bieber,Broad City,Bo Burnham, Troye Sivan, Kyle Mooney, and Lilly Singh. When longtime YouTuber Issa Rae started uploading episodes of her 2011 web seriesThe Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl,a writer friend advised her to format it like a proper TV show. Invitations to adapt it for prime time soon followed, but as Rae later toldThe New York Times,“They wanted to make it as broad as possible.” She eventually made her way to HBO, where she cocreated the award-winningInsecure. McLaughlin and Neal took a different path. Their YouTube channel led to a gig on a short-lived 2011 cable TV series calledCommercial Kings.Instead of being their big break, it left them in LA limbo. They churned out scripts and took endless meetings. “The vast majority of things that you put your time into, no one’s ever going to see because that’s just how this town works,” McLaughlin says. Then in their early 30s, both men had small children at home. They ultimately decided to double down on being YouTube creators, with all the freedom and entrepreneurialism that entails. Streamers like Netflix and Peacock are increasingly eager to scoop up YouTube talent, who come with a built-in global audience. “The ones who do it the best build a real community, and then it’s not about: What can I sell them? It’s: What can I create to expand my reach?” says Oren Rosenbaum, a partner at United Talent Agency and cohead of their Creators division. “There’s many examples of creators who started with us doing one thing and now have written a book, gone on tour, created a podcast, launched a consumer product. If you’ve built this loyal audience, and you find a thing that makes sense for you and for them, it’s a home run.” And, as USC’s Craig points out, YouTube creators can do more than just make money off of their followers: “They can also persuade them to vote in certain ways and care about certain causes.” That includes a number of right-wing podcasters and conspiracy theorists who’ve built nests on YouTube. Streamers like Netflix and Peacock are increasingly eager to scoop up YouTube talent, who come with a built-in global audience. But when Hollywood comes knocking, successful creators increasingly consider it a side gig. Why give up total control over your project when no one knows as much about your viewers as you do? Superstar creatorMrBeast(a.k.a. Jimmy Donaldson) recently launched a reality competition calledBeast Gamesfor Amazon Prime. Although Amazon says it was their most-watched unscripted series ever, it’s unlikely Donaldson will forsake his digital kingdom. “All of these creators tend to think about how to use what they’re doing off platform to drive [viewers] back to home base,” says YouTube VP Tara Walpert Levy. She was delighted to see a list of mantras on the wall of MrBeast’s studio. At the top of the list: “YouTube first.” While YouTube toasts to 20 years of memes and memories, the traditional entertainment industry is in agonizing flux. “On the more traditional side of things, it’s all about cost cutting,” says Ali Berman, partner at UTA and cohead with Rosenbaum of the Creators division. “It’s so ironic, because onourside of the business, it’s all about increasing staff, creating writers rooms, hiring producers. Our creators are building the media companies of today.” Mohan, YouTube’s CEO, likes to call the legion of creator-led studios popping up “the start-up economy of Hollywood.” That goes for Burbank denizens like theGood Mythical Morninggang as well as Alan Chikin Chow, a mastermind of candy-colored teen skits who recently opened a production hub there. But some of the new studios are nowhere near LA: Kinigra Deon, a purveyor of family-friendly shorts and feature-length videos, is building a production hub in Alabama; MrBeast operates from a 50,000-square-foot studio in North Carolina; and Dude Perfect just unveiled an 80,000-square-foot space in Texas. Even farther afield, the rural Indian town of Tulsi is known as YouTube Village, because more than a quarter of the population is involved in creating videos, inspiring the local government to establish a state-of-the-art studio. YouTube now offers its creators the ability to arrange their videos as distinct series with bingeable episodes. The argument goes that if it looks like TV and acts like TV, surely it should be rewarded—and awarded—like TV? Some of the bigger American creator studios combine amateurs and professionals. When Khare needs to mount a particularly epic production—like learning how to do Harry Houdini’s most dangerous stunt—her team can balloon to 80 people on set. She thinks of her show in terms of seasons and arcs these days, which she hopes will make it easier for Hollywood to see the well-produced work she does as Emmy-worthy or even Oscar adjacent. YouTube now offers its creators the ability to arrange their videos as distinct series with bingeable episodes, and YouTube Premium is rolling out the option to watch at 4X playback speed. The argument goes that if it looks like TV and acts like TV, surely it should be rewarded—and awarded—like TV? YouTube programs have won some Emmys, but only in ghettoized Interactive Media categories.Hot OnesandGood Mythical Morningmade it onto Emmy ballots last year, but none snagged nominations. Mohan is pushing hard for the TV Academy to be more welcoming of creators. “If you’re trying to recognize creativity that comes out of the cultural zeitgeist, then how can you exclude this enormous class of content?” The Oscars and Emmys themselves partly sprung out of fledgling industries’ desire to drum up legitimacy, capital, and cultural respect. Craig suggests that YouTube has similar reasons for wanting to be included. “In 1981 the head of the FCC referred to television as ‘a toaster with pictures,’ ” he says. “Those same kinds of condemnations are leveled at social media platforms. So YouTube has a very strong reason to want to gain more legitimacy from the greater society, so that they don’t find themselves lumped in with other social media platforms being accused of destroying civilization.” While traditional TV studios have humans vetting content and applying strict standards, however, YouTube is a largely unregulated environment ruled by algorithms. Trolling, scamming, racism, and sexually inappropriate material float through the ether—think PewDiePie’s antisemitic videos or Logan Paul’s infamous footage of what appeared to be the body of someone who’d died by suicide. Tales of radicalization, like Caleb Cain’s, are not uncommon either. Mohan points out that YouTube tries to strike a balance: It has community guidelines, and often takes appropriate action, but it is first and foremost an open platform. “Our mission is to give everyone a voice and show them the world,” he says. “There isn’t a gatekeeper or a standards body exercising their judgment, and that’s fundamentally the power of YouTube.” Mythical’s Neal acknowledges that YouTube was once a Wild West, but notes that as it’s grown in influence, creators have upped their game in terms of content and production values: “More and more creators are doing that because the audience now is turning on their television and they’re seeing the YouTube icon right next to Max and Netflix. They don’t want to see somebody leaning up against their bed with a handheld camera.” The question of whether content is “high quality” enough to merit mainstream approbation strikes YouTube’s Levy as completely irrelevant. “Viewers vote with their time what they perceive to be the most high quality, which sometimes aligns with how we traditionally in the industry would have defined and picked it, and sometimes doesn’t,” she says. “I really believe that viewers have erased the distinction between different aspects of our entertainment ecosystem. This is just sort of new TV, and we’re all in it together.” The majority of YouTubers still don’t aspire to win Emmys, and many of them make videos that don’t fit into any of traditional TV’s categories—which is part of the point. Where else would you find someone likeMina Le, whose videos combine cultural commentary and personal adventures, or the performative music criticism of Anthony Fantano’sThe Needledrop? Yet it makes perfect sense that entertainment industry insiders would resist embracing an atomizing platform that has no interest in upholding its strictures and standards. UTA’s Rosenbaum is keeping his eye on the next generation of entertainment executives moving up the ladder. “They’re the ones that are consuming this content,” he says, “and now they’re in the position where they can create change.” McLaughlin says that lately he’s had a lot more established industry people wondering if they should skip all the pitches and pilots, and make work for YouTube. “You meet someone who has had a lot of success, maybe as an actor or a producer, and they’re like, ‘Man, I wish I could build something like you guys,’ ” he says, “because they’re at the whims of the studio.” Not that McLaughlin thinks the path he and Neal took was easy. The partners spent a dozen years building up an audience forGood Mythical Morning,not to mention all the videos they made before that. “Yes, it’s over here on YouTube, but it’s an institution,” McLaughlin says proudly. And it gets around. At a recent party, McLaughlin met an actor and they had the inevitable LA conversation. The actor said,What are you working on?And when McLaughlin mentioned his channel, the actor said, “Oh, I knowGood Mythical Morning. My urologist showed me a video of you and your friend getting a vasectomy together!” This story has been updated.

    "title": "“Fascism Works If Everybody Is Afraid”: One Democratic Congressman’s Antidote to Trumpism",
    "article_text": "Illinois congressmanSean Castenhas held upward of 80 town halls in his suburban Chicago district since he was elected in 2018. To the Democrat, they’re a basic part of a functioning democracy. People “deserve to have their voices heard,” he tells me. “They deserve to feel represented.” Those voices can sometimes be angry or frustrated. Casten was one of several Democrats to faceconfrontational town hall crowdslast month, but he calls the events a kind of remedy to the cynicism that has festered in the Trump era. “You come away with the sense that we have so much more in common than we have that divides us,” he says, “and that this is the way democracy works.” In a conversation, which has been edited for clarity and length, Casten discusses Democrats’ recent public gatherings in Republican districts, the impact of Trump’s agenda on rural areas, and the need for political courage in an era of acquiescence. “If all of us who have something to lose see the risk of individual courage as being an incentive to sit down and do nothing,” he warns, “we’re going to lose our democracy.” Vanity Fair:You’ve talked about how your first run was inspired in part because your representative—Peter Roskam at the time—was not holding town halls. Why was that such an important and animating factor for you? Sean Casten:I had not been super politically engaged before I ran for Congress. But I had gone to meet with [Roskam] to advocate with some clean-energy folks for removing some of the barriers to entrepreneurs doing clean-energy things. And when I challenged him on some of his logic, he stood up and walked out of the room and said the meeting was over. I didn’t challenge him disrespectfully. And when I started talking to people who were more politically active than myself, they said, “Oh, that’s just his style.” And there’s something that just felt civically wrong to me. You’re an elected official, you’re a representative—I don’t expect you to agree with me, but I expect you to sort of understand the mood of folks and to be able to explain your convictions. If you’re not willing to do that, you shouldn’t be in this line of work. If you have the talents to do this job, almost by definition, you could make more money and spend more time with your family at lots of other jobs. The reason to do this is because you’re committed to making sure that democracy works, making sure that people vote, making sure that when people do vote, they are fully informed on all the issues. And if you’re not willing to do that, we need to get you out of this line of work. And now you’ve held these town halls in red districts. What did you take away from that? I think the coolest thing was how familiar they felt to town halls that I’ve done up here in DuPage and Cook [counties]. And to be clear, I don’t think I’ve ever gotten more than 54% of the vote. This is not a super-blue district. Statistically, I don’t think I’ve ever done a town hall where everybody in the room agreed with me or voted for me. But what I’ve always found is that when you go into these rooms and engage seriously and respectfully with the issues of the day, you come away with the sense that we have so much more in common than we have that divides us, and that this is the way democracy works. And there was nothing fundamentally about doing the town hall in Dixon or down in Carterville. There were people in the room who didn’t agree with me. Some of them were in full MAGA regalia, making it clear visually that they didn’t agree with me. But there was the same sense. There was this very funny moment where one woman got up who was clearly politically aligned with me, and was lamenting the fact that when she went to Washington, [Republican congressman]Mike Bostrefused to take a meeting with her, and what did I suggest she do? And I said, like, candidly, of the thousands of meeting requests I get, I only have time to take a dozen, so don’t take that personally. The next woman who got up had a MAGA hat and a MAGA shirt on, and she said, “Don’t take it the wrong way—he doesn’t meet with me either.” It was just this nice moment. I think we are primed as individuals to look at the outfit someone is wearing and make an assumption about their tribal loyalties. And the beauty of a town hall is the recognition that, no, we’re all just sacks of carbon walking around trying to do the best we can. Beyond that, did you get a sense from these voters who supported Trump as to why they turned out to see a Democratic representative? What concerns did they share? The stuff that really stuck with me was how much of what Trump is doing is hurting rural America, and how much rural America felt like they have been ignored for too long by both parties. You had folks who voted for Trump who were sitting there saying, “You know, I depend on Social Security, and we’re being told now that no one is going to be on the telephone, we have to go in person, but I don’t have the ability to do that. You know, I’m a farmer who depends on the fact that most of our soy crop goes to China, and these reciprocal tariffs are going to decimate a huge chunk of our business, and I don’t know what to do about that.” It’s one thing to talk about Medicaid cuts in Chicago, where you can walk any five miles and you can find a hospital. It’s something else to talk about those cuts in rural America, where there’s only one hospital in the county, and that hospital depends on Medicaid funding. And you just had this sense that there’s real pain that is going to be disproportionately borne by the less wealthy parts of our country and the more rural parts of our country, and they don’t have anybody to talk to about it because the Democrats don’t campaign there and Republicans are being told, “Don’t do town halls.” And those people are Americans. They deserve to have their voices heard. They deserve to feel represented. Democrats are doing more of these town halls, especially during the recess. What do you hope to accomplish—both politically, and in terms of some of the broader themes we’re talking about here? This is going to sound very Boy Scout-y. I think if you trust democracy, you have to be committed to making sure that everybody votes and everybody’s informed. You should not be committed to assuming that only people who agree with you should vote. Lately, whenever I go to speak to students, I remind them that if you read what our founders wrote before they wrote the Constitution, they spent a lot of time talking about the importance of virtue in society and how a government based on the rule of law doesn’t work unless you have virtuous people implementing those laws. That’s the bed of democracy. We have to work on the assumption that most people are virtuous and that they can be trusted to make the right decision when given complete information. The things that make me concerned about the Republican Party—yes, we have our policy differences, but ultimately it’s because the Republican Party is really keen on voter suppression and spreading misinformation, and that’s antithetical to what our founders knew democracy depended on. This is a Boy Scout-y question, too, then, but I do spend a lot of time thinking about how cynical politics are right now. I mean, it’s romantic to act like there hasn’t always been cynicism in politics—politicians lie, that’s no surprise. But it does seem like there’s just an assumption now that there’s going to be rampant lying, that you can’t trust anything, and that power is really the only currency. And once you go down that road, it can be hard to put the toothpaste back in the tube. It sounds like you’re talking about a kind of earnestness that you’re not really seeing a lot of in politics right now. Since Trump came down that escalator, we’ve been in a moment where the loudest voice in politics has been someone saying, “You can’t trust anybody, it’s all a racket.” You know, “I’ll be greedy for you, and just trust me because I’ll look out for your interests.” And that spreads a certain cynicism in America. Prior to that, we had a pretty charismatic guy who said that there’s no red America, there’s no blue America, and campaigned on a message of hope, and was sufficiently persuasive that [Chief Justice]John Robertssaid that we now live in a “post-racial society.” Roberts was not remotely correct. But I think he genuinely believed that, because [Barack Obama] told a story about America that made him feel better about being an American, because he wanted that to be true. I don’t think the arc of history has bent as far toward justice as we thought it had when Obama was president. But I don’t think it’s bent as far away from justice as it has whenDonald Trumpis the president. I think for us to believe in the promise of America and for us to be committed to preserving the promise of America, we need political figures to articulate that hopeful, inclusive vision. Because there will always be demagogues. There will always be populists. That’s been true since our founding. We’ve survived this long because we’ve also had the other. One of the things about that arc-of-history line is that it implies there’s this inevitability to it. But the Trump era has made clear that progress or regression comes from choices, and right now, it seems the Republican Party is making a choice not to check Trump in any way. The courts have tried to exert that check, but he has shown himself willing to defy those decisions. What can be done to slow him down? I would submit to you that the arc of history has only bent toward progress when huge numbers of Americans have jumped up and grabbed it and dragged it against its will to bend in that direction. That is not a natural curve. The fact that we are living in a country where the president of the United States is ignoring the Constitution, breaking the law, and is seeing broad acquiescence from not just one entire political party, but large numbers of Americans who seem apathetic—that’s only surprising to white people, right? Because our country really did pass the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments, and we really did, for all practical purposes, refuse to enforce them until Congress passed the civil rights acts of 1964 and 1965. We still have a long way to go. But we didn’t pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964 because John F. Kennedy campaigned on it and promised he would. He and ultimately [Lyndon B.] Johnson were dragged to that by huge numbers of people on the ground who were bending that arc toward justice. AsCondoleezza Ricesays, the ultimate purpose of politics is to make the impossible seem to be inevitable. None of that is to take away from this moment. It’s just to say that you can look at our history and find plenty of moments like this one. Youcannotlook at our history and find moments like this one that turned on somebody in Washington giving a great speech that suddenly moved public will. Movements always come first. Trump was checked last time he was in office not by my great rhetoric—he was checked because a lot of women took to the streets, because a lot of Parkland students took to the streets. There was this movement. What have you made of the public response so far? And not just to the Trump administration, but to Democrats—because we’ve seen a lot of frustration with Democrats at some of these town halls as well, including one you held in Downers Grove last month. What do you make of the public mood right now? I think we’ve shifted as a society in 100 days from being exhausted by Trump and somewhat apathetic into fear and into anger and into action. And that’s all painful, but necessary. The thing that scares me right now—and Trump is playing on this—is that almost anybody who feels like they have something to lose if they speak out is choosing not to speak out. Whether that’s a university concerned it might get its research funding cut if it doesn’t reduce its commitment to diversity, or maybe it’s a law firm concerned that if it doesn’t pay a pro bono fee, it’s going to lose some of its managing partners to another law firm who will play that game, maybe it’s a politician who is nervous that the Proud Boys are going to be told their home address if they call out Trump. And if all of us who have something to lose see the risk of individual courage as being an incentive to sit down and do nothing, we’re going to lose our democracy. I think I will be optimistic about the future of our country when I see those people who are afraid of individual courage instead choosing collective courage, because that’s the other door you could pick. Fascism works if everybody is afraid of being a tall poppy. But we can all be tall poppies.

    "title": "Where’s the ‘eco’ in South Lantau’s eco-recreation plan?",
    "article_text": "There seems to be a greater emphasis on building tourist infrastructure than on conservation, and little effort to dovetail with local communities The United Nations defines ecotourism as “nature-based forms of tourism in which the main motivation of the tourists is the observation and appreciation of nature as well as the traditional cultures prevailing in natural areas”, generating economic benefits for host communities. Hence, there would be an emphasis on wildlife viewing, along with enhancements of natural habitats and integration with local communities. Right? Wrong. Even though Shui Hau and Pui O rank among Hong Kong’s top 20 sites for bird diversity, there is nothing about birdwatching in the proposed Lantau “corridor”. Apart from a few proposals such as a treetop walkway in Pui O, the plan seems to largely focus on constructing buildings, piers and car parks to solely benefit humans. Ideas even include a chairlift and a “luge” – surely not involving ice, but likely hurtling downhill on a sort of sledge on wheels – as well as catering and retail facilities and “quality holiday accommodation”. Despite the “eco” in its name, the corridor does not evidently involve the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, but is the responsibility of the Civil Engineering and Development Department, which in 2017 established the Sustainable Lantau Office. In August 2021, the department signed a HK$11 million consultancy agreement for an investigation study for “sustainable leisure and recreation initiatives” in Shek Pik and adjoining areas with Binnies Hong Kong – which on LinkedIn describes itself as “a multidisciplinary engineering consultant” that has “played a significant role in developing tailored infrastructure solutions”.",

    "title": "Putin ‘easier to deal with’ than Zelensky – Trump",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has admitted that he expected Vladimir Zelensky to be much“easier to deal with”than Russian President Vladimir Putin. Zelenskypublicly rejecteda reported key point in the proposedUS peace frameworkfor resolving the Ukraine conflict, insisting earlier this week that Kiev will not even discuss formally recognizing Crimea as Russian territory. The White House criticized him forrevealing sensitive detailsof the negotiations. Trump warned that Zelenskyrisks losing the entire countryif he continues to stall talks with Moscow. “I think Russia is ready… I think we have a deal with Russia. We have to get a deal with Zelensky,”Trump told journalists at the White House on Wednesday. And I hope that Zelensky… I thought it might be easier to deal with Zelensky – so far it’s been harder. The US president added:“that’s okay, it’s alright,”expressing hope that“we’ll have a deal with both.” Earlier on Wednesday, Trump said in a post on Truth Social that Zelensky holds a weak bargaining position.“The situation for Ukraine is dire – He can have Peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole Country.” Trump declined to say whether he intends to meet with Zelensky when they are expected to attend the funeral of Pope Francis later this week.“I don’t know if he is going to the funeral or not… I just hope he gets this thing solved,”Trump told reporters. Asked whether he expects to meet with Putin during a planned visit to Saudi Arabia next month, Trump said it is“possible, but most likely not… I think we’ll meet with him shortly thereafter.” The US has been pushing for a resolution to the conflict, while also seeking to secure a minerals extraction agreement with Ukraine to help offset the billions of dollars it has spent supplying weapons and aid. However, Trump and his administration have grown increasingly frustrated with the slow pace of negotiations on both fronts. Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned on Tuesday that if progress stalls, the US may walk away from the talks.“If not enough movement is happening, we may need to move on to other priorities,”he said. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also voiced Trump’s frustration with Zelensky.“Unfortunately, Zelensky has been trying to litigate this peace negotiation in the press, and that’s unacceptable to the president,”Leavitt said on Wednesday. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted that a peace deal with Ukraine is unlikely to be concluded in an expedited manner due to the complexities of the negotiations. Moscow has said it has always been ready to engage in peace talks, provided they ensure a permanent solution that addresses the root causes of the conflict – while a temporary ceasefire would be used by Ukraine’s Western backers to rearm the country’s military.",
